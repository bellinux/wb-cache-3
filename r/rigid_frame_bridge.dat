Against {{the problem}} of the {{aerodynamic}} interference effects on aerostatic coefficients between parallel continuous <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> with high-pier and long-span, the aerodynamic interference effects on aerostatic coefficients of main beam in the parallel long-span continuous <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> were investigated in details by means of wind tunnel test. The space between the two main beams and wind attack angles were changed during the wind tunnel test to study the effects on aerodynamic interferences of aerostatic coefficients of main beam. The test got aerostatic coefficients of 10 conditions. The research results have shown that the aerodynamic interference effects on aerostatic coefficients of main beam in parallel bridges can not be ignored. The aerodynamic interference effects on parallel bridge main beam is shown mainly as follows: The drag coefficient of main beam downstream dropped and the drag coefficient of main beam upstream changed but not change significantly. There are also the aerodynamic interference effects of lateral force coefficient and torque coefficient between the main beams upstream and downstream. The effects upstream are smaller and the effects downstream are larger...|$|R
40|$|A rapid bridge {{replacement}} (RBR) {{method was}} designed and used for {{the replacement of the}} Highway 401 twin overpasses at Cornwall Centre Road in Cornwall, Ontario. This RBR project was the first heavy-lift and move of large, approximately 1400 tonne, reinforced concrete <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> in Ontario. The new structures were prefabricated in staging areas near the sites and moved to their final locations by specialized heavy-lift construction equipment, comprising self-propelled modular transporters (SPMTs). For the westbound lane structure, a segmental approach where a top <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> component and two bottom footing components were constructed separately and connected at their final location was adopted to reduce the weight of the structure due to limited space available for SPMTs. For the eastbound lane structure, the entire <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> integrated with footings was constructed and transported by specially configured SPMTs and lifting system that included climbing jacks to lower the entire structure 1. 5 m to its final position after transportation. A three-dimensional, linear elastic finite element analysis was utilized for design due to the high skew (51. 5 °) of the <b>rigid</b> <b>frames</b> to ensure the strength and stability of the structures during lifting and transportation, and their final backfilled service condition. The cost for RBR construction was approximately 25 % higher than that of the conventional construction. However, the project confirmed that it is feasible to use the RBR method of construction for complex <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> to significantly reduce the duration of traffic impacts for the construction of these types of structures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As {{the span}} became longer and the {{accumulation}} of service period of bridges, the problem that deflection of main span has also clearly emerged. To reduce long term deflection of large-span prestressed concrete continuous <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> <b>bridges,</b> tendon group-additional bending moment influence matrix method is proposed to optimize the design of prestressed reinforcement. Based on elasticity assumption, an optimum prestressed tendon arrangement can be derived by least square method. The new design is tested to be effective considering shrink and creep effect which fulfills the practical application...|$|R
50|$|Engineers {{have found}} this type of design {{advantageous}} for many reasons. Moments {{at the center of}} the deck of a rigid-frame bridge are smaller than the corresponding moments in a simply supported deck. Therefore, a much shallower cross section at mid-span can be used. Additional benefits are that less space is required for the approaches and structural details for where the deck bears on the abutments are not necessary. Engineers have also noted some disadvantages of <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> <b>bridges.</b> The placement of steel reinforcing bars (rebars) can be very difficult and the forming/placement of the concrete is complicated. Furthermore, <b>rigid</b> <b>frames</b> are statically indeterminate and the analysis is more challenging than that of simply supported structures.|$|R
5000|$|A {{v-shaped}} <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> is {{an efficient}} way to support a longer bridge where using only one span isn't feasible. Each v-shaped pier supports the deck in two places while only requiring one foundation. The bending moments experienced in the piers are minimal, allowing significant reductions in the foundation size. [...] Additionally, the effective length of each span is shortened compared to the spans of a bridge with vertical piers. [...] However, this system is less commonly used in <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> because the piers need to be approximately centered under the bridge. Often the bridges span over roadways or waterways and construction of piers in those cases can be costly and challenging.|$|R

50|$|Batter-post <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> {{are defined}} by their {{supports}} that run from the deck to the abutments at an angle. This design supports the deck {{in a similar way}} to v-shaped piers but differs in how the foundations must be built. The piers bear on or next to the abutments, eliminating the need for foundations directly beneath the bridge. This is particularly advantageous when the bridge crosses a river and constructing a foundation in the water is challenging. As a result, either the abutments have to be made larger or additional foundations must be placed next to the abutments.|$|R

50|$|In {{the past}} few years, most {{research}} on <b>rigid</b> <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> is related to retrofitting existing structures to meet new seismic specifications. This research often finds {{that the amount of}} reinforcing required at beam-to-column joints needs to be increased in concrete structures. In many bridges, the amount of steel required by the seismic code causes congestion at the joints. To alleviate this, steel fibers can be used as reinforcement to improve the bond between the rebars and the surrounding concrete. Tests have shown that by using steel fiber reinforced concrete, the anchorage length of rebar can be reduced while improving shear and flexural capacities. The reduced anchorage length required reduces the congestion at beam-to-column joints.|$|R
