40|$|Consistent {{assignment}} of vibrational motions across substituted benzene derivatives is a long-standing desire amongst spectroscopists. In this thesis, the S 1 electronic states of monohalosubstituted benzene molecules and their deuterated isotopologues are investigated, using <b>resonance</b> enhanced multiphoton <b>ionisation</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> The observed vibrational bands are assigned using the Mi nomenclature proposed by Gardner and Wright where ring localised vibrations {{having the same}} atomic motion are given the same label, allowing straightforward comparisons of vibrational motions across monosubstituted benzene molecules to be achieved. Detailed investigation showed {{that it would not}} be possible to apply the same Mi nomenclature labels to the para disubstutited benzene derivatives owing to the different vibrational motions of mono- and disubstituted benzene molecules. As a consequence a new nomenclature, Di, for labelling the vibrational motions of para disubstituted benzene molecules is proposed in this work. The Di labelling scheme is based on the vibrations of the para difluorobenzene molecule.

40|$|This work {{contains}} two main {{areas of research}} {{within the field of}} bonding and spectroscopy. The first is the interactions of metals and metal ions with rare gas atoms; the second concerns vibrational dynamics in para-fluorotoluene(pFT). The research has been carried out as part of a collaboration between the SOCAR and Reid groups at the University of Nottingham and also involved external research teams. The work combines the results from experiments employing several different spectroscopic techniques with theoretical calculations, which support the experimental data, assist in their interpretation and provide new information. <b>Resonance</b> enhanced multiphoton <b>ionisation</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> is employed to investigate the Au–Xe and Au–Ne neutral complexes in the region of the 62 PJ ← 62 S 1 / 2 Au atomic transition. High-level ab initio calculations provide further insight, which is necessary to explain the unusual spectra obtained. A theoretical study of complexes containing Group 2 metal cations and rare gases also reveals some unexpected trends that are related to some of the effects seen in the Au–RG series. A combination of nanosecond zero electron kinetic energy spectroscopy and time-resolved picosecond photoelectron spectroscopy is employed to investigate the vibrational dynamics of pFT. Excitation via several different vibrational states allows the study of a Fermi resonance, statistical intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution and an intermediate case that shows evidence of so-called “doorway states”.

Using an appropriate representation and averaging approximations {{we show that}} resonant ionisation is controlled by a separatrix, and provide necessary conditions for a dynamical resonance to affect the ionisation probability. The position of the dynamical resonance is computed using a high-order perturbation series, and estimate its radius of convergence. We show that {{the position of the}} dynamical resonance does not coincide precisely with the ionisation maxima, and that the field switch-on time can dramatically affect the ionisation signal which, for long switch times, reflects the shape of an incipient homoclinic. Similarly, the <b>resonance</b> <b>ionisation</b> time can reflect the time-scale of the separatrix motion, which is therefore longer than conventional static field Stark ionisation.

They originate {{from a range of}} nuclear activities such as weapons testing, nuclear reprocessing and nuclear fuel cycle discharges and nuclear accidents. Whilst 137 Cs, 134 Cs and 136 Cs are routinely measurable at high sensitivity by gamma spectrometry, routine detection of long-lived 135 Cs by radiometric methods is challenging. This measurement is, however, important given its significance in long-term nuclear waste storage and disposal. Furthermore, the 135 Cs/ 137 Cs ratio varies with reactor, weapon and fuel type, and accurate measurement of this ratio can therefore be used as a forensic tool in identifying the source(s) of nuclear contamination. The shorter-lived activation products 134 Cs and 136 Cs have a limited application but provide useful early information on fuel irradiation history and have importance in health physics. Detection of 135 Cs (and 137 Cs) is achievable by mass spectrometric techniques; most commonly inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), as well as thermal ionisation (TIMS), accelerator (AMS) and <b>resonance</b> <b>ionisation</b> (RIMS) techniques. The critical issues affecting the accuracy and detection limits achievable by this technique are effective removal of barium to eliminate isobaric interferences arising from 135 Ba and 137 Ba, and elimination of peak tailing of stable 133 Cs on 135 Cs. Isobaric interferences can be removed by chemical separation, most commonly ion exchange chromatography, and/or instrumental separation using an ICP-MS equipped with a reaction cell.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work has been to {{increase}} the knowledge of electron-electron correlation through experimental studies of negative ions. Negative ions are atoms or molecules to which an extra electron has been attached. Due to the energy sharing between the electrons, the eﬀects of electron interactions, and thus electron-electron correlation, are relatively large in these systems. Comparisons of experimental data and results from ab initio many-body calculations can therefore serve as sensitive tests of our knowledge of these correlation eﬀects. This thesis describes experimental investigations of fundamental properties of atomic negative ions. Photodetachment experiments have been performed with collinearly merged laser- and ion-beams. A new threshold behaviour have been observed in photodetachment of K− into the K(5 2 G) channel. A semi-classical model has been developed, which qualitatively describes the behaviour {{as a result of}} the large and negative polarisability of the 5 2 G state. Partial cross sections for K− and Cs− photodetachment to highly excited states in the residual atom have been measured. Two previously unobserved resonances have been identiﬁed in K− below the K(7 2 P) channel opening, while a rich spectrum of resonances was observed in Cs− below the Cs(10 2 P 1 / 2, 3 / 2) thresholds. Improved values for the electron aﬃnities of W and P and the ﬁne structure intervals of P− are presented. Moreover, the binding energy of the previously unobserved 2 S 1 / 2 state in Pt− has been determined, and photodetachment from a previously unknown bound state in W− has been observed. The experiments were made possible by extensive development of the experimental facility at GUNILLA (Göteborg University Negative Ion Laser LAboratory). A state-selective detection scheme utilizing <b>resonance</b> <b>ionisation</b> has been developed. It is based on excitation to a Rydberg state, which is ﬁeld-ionised in an inhomogeneous ﬁeld. The produced positive ion is subsequently detected with a position-sensitive detector. The resolution of the mass spectrometer has been substantially improved, which proved important in the W− and Pt− measurements...|$|R
40|$|Infrared spectroscopy, {{coupled with}} mass {{spectrometry}} {{has been used}} to investigate a specific sized gas phase clusters. In particular, alkali metals i. e. lithium or lanthanides such as ytterbium in the presence of ammonia derivative solvents, has been explored observing both the electronic and vibrational spectral characteristics. Ab initio work has been carried out in support of experimental work which has given some vital clues to help assign some spectra. Firstly, the first electronic spectrum of Li(NH 3) 4 has been observed. Strong absorption is observed in the near-infrared and the band system is assigned to the Ã²T 2 -X-tilde²A 1 transition in the tetrahedral complex. The vibrational structure is indicative of a substantial Jahn-Teller effect in the excited electronic state. Following this, LiNH 3 was the next complex to be investigated, the spectra is consistent with two electronic transitions in close proximity, the Ã²E-X-tilde²A 1 and B-tilde²A 1 -X-tilde²A 1 systems. Vibrational structure is seen in both systems and the prominence of a particular band is attributed to a Herzberg-Teller coupling. The electronic spectrum of the Li-methylamine cluster was attempted, this spectrum occurrs in the near-infrared and shows provisional bands assigned to the Ã²A-X-tilde²A 0 -superscript 0 -subscript 0, B-tilde²A-X-tilde²A 0 -superscript 0 -subscript 0 and possibly the C-tilde²A-X-tilde²A 0 -superscript 0 -subscript 0 electronic transitions. An effort was made to try and record the IR depletion spectrum of a mixed cluster, such as Li(NH 3) n(Ma) m, despite the additional bulk of the methylamine group, up to four solvent molecules were able to reside within the first solvation shell. Finally, the electronic spectrum of the rare earth complex, YbNH 3 has been recorded using two colour resonance-enhanced multiphoton <b>ionisation</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (REMPI). The spectrum arises from a spin-forbidden transition between the ¹A 1 ground electronic state and a ³E excited electronic state. Some vibrational structure is also observed in the REMPI spectrum which has been assigned. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Using the <b>resonance</b> {{multi-photon}} <b>ionisation</b> (RMPI) technique, we {{have for}} the first time studied time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectra of Ni neutral atoms sputtered into the a³F₄,₃,₂ atomic states (F states) and the a³D₃,₂,₁ and a¹D₂ atomic states (D states) from Ni₃Al(100) and NiAl(110). TOF mass spectra from Ni(1 0 0) have also been measured. For these three surfaces, the TOF spectra of Ni atoms emitted in D states shifted toward a shorter TOF compared to those in F states. The TOF spectra of Ni atoms emitted in different F states are almost the same but the TOF spectra of Ni atoms emitted in metastable D states depend very slightly on the excitation energy of Ni metastable atoms so that the TOF spectra of Ni atoms in the higher energy states include more high energy particles. Finally, the d band structure is shown to have no effect, to within experimental error, on the features of TOF spectra...|$|R
