5000|$|Analysis of <b>retroposon</b> insertions {{offers a}} higher degree of {{confidence}} because <b>retroposon</b> insertion is [...] "virtually homoplasy-free", as retroposons insert at random positions throughout the genome, whereas point mutations in DNA cycle between only four possible options. This makes it less likely that random coincidence or convergent evolution creates illusory similarities between unrelated groups. However, the technique requires very extensive genomic data - in the 2011 paper, approximately 200,000 retroposon-containing loci were examined to identify 51 individual retroposition events which are present in some birds but not others.|$|E
40|$|<b>Retroposons</b> are {{ubiquitous}} transposable elements {{found in}} the genomes of most eukaryotes, including trypanosomatids. The African and American trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi) contain long autonomous <b>retroposons</b> of the ingi clade (Tbingi and L 1 Tc, respectively) and short nonautonomous truncated versions (TbRIME and NARTc, respectively), as well as degenerate ingi-related <b>retroposons</b> devoid of coding capacity (DIREs). In contrast, Leishmania major contains only remnants of extinct <b>retroposons</b> (LmDIREs) and of short nonautonomous heterogeneous elements (LmSIDERs). We extend this comparative and evolutionary analysis of <b>retroposons</b> to the genomes of two other African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax) and another Leishmania sp. (Leishmania braziliensis). Three new potentially functional <b>retroposons</b> of the ingi clade have been identified: Tvingi in T. vivax and Tcoingi and L 1 Tco in T. congolense. T. congolense is the first trypanosomatid containing two classes of potentially active <b>retroposons</b> of the ingi clade. We analyzed sequences located upstream of these new long autonomous ingi-related elements, which code for the recognition site of the retroposon-encoded endonuclease. The closely related Tcoingi and Tvingi elements show the same conserved pattern, indicating that the Tcoingi- and Tvingi-encoded endonucleases share site specificity. Similarly, the conserved pattern previously identified upstream of L 1 Tc has also been detected at the same relative position upstream of L 1 Tco elements. A phylogenetic analysis of all ingi-related <b>retroposons</b> identified so far, including DIREs, clearly shows that several distinct subfamilies have emerged and coexisted, though {{in the course of}} trypanosomatid evolution, only a few have been maintained as active elements in modern trypanosomatid (sub) species...|$|R

50|$|Retroposition {{accounts}} for approximately 10,000 gene-duplication {{events in the}} human genome, of which approximately 2-10% {{are likely to be}} functional. Such genes are called retrogenes and represent a certain type of <b>retroposon.</b> A classical event is the retroposition of a spliced pre-mRNA molecule of the c-src gene into the proviral ancestor of the Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV). The retroposed c-src pre-mRNA still contained a single intron and within RSV is now referred to as v-src gene.|$|E
40|$|Microsatellites are {{tandem repeat}} {{sequences}} abundant in the genomes of higher eukaryotes and hitherto considered as "junk DNA. " Analysis of a human genome representative data base (2. 84 Mb) reveals a distinct juxtaposition of A-rich microsatellites and <b>retroposons</b> and suggests their coevolution. The analysis implies that most microsatellites were generated by a 3 '-extension of retrotranscripts, similar to mRNA polyadenylylation, and that they serve in turn as "retroposition navigators," directing the <b>retroposons</b> via homology-driven integration into defined sites. Thus, they became instrumental in the preservation and extension of primordial genomic patterns. A role is assigned to these reiterating A-rich loci in the higher-order organization of the chromatin. The disease-associated triplet repeats are mostly found in coding regions and do not show an association with <b>retroposons,</b> constituting a unique set within the family of microsatellite sequences...|$|R
40|$|Trypanosomatids are {{unicellular}} protists {{that include}} the human pathogens Leishmania spp. (leishmaniasis), Trypanosoma brucei (sleeping sickness), and Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease). Analysis of their recently completed genomes confirmed the presence of non-long-terminal repeat retrotransposons, also called <b>retroposons.</b> Using the 79 -bp signature sequence common to all trypanosomatid <b>retroposons</b> as bait, we identified in the Leishmania major genome two new large families of small elements - LmSIDER 1 (785 copies) and LmSIDER 2 (1, 073 copies) - that fulfill all the characteristics of extinct trypanosomatid <b>retroposons.</b> LmSIDERs are ∼ 70 times more abundant in L. major compared to T. brucei and are found almost exclusively within the 3 ′-untranslated regions (3 ′UTRs) of L. major mRNAs. We provide experimental evidence that LmSIDER 2 act as mRNA instability elements and that LmSIDER 2 -containing mRNAs are generally expressed at lower levels compared to the non-LmSIDER 2 mRNAs. The considerable expansion of LmSIDERs within 3 ′UTRs in an organism lacking transcriptional control and their role in regulating mRNA stability indicate that Leishmania have probably recycled these short <b>retroposons</b> to globally modulate {{the expression of a}} number of genes.

50|$|Marsupials reached Australia via Antarctica about 50 mya, {{shortly after}} Australia had split off. This {{suggests}} a single dispersion event {{of just one}} species, most likely a relative to South Americas monito del monte (a microbiothere, the only New World australidelphian). This progenitor may have rafted across the widening, but still narrow, gap between Australia and Antarctica. In Australia, they radiated into the wide variety seen today. Modern marsupials appear to have reached the islands of Borneo and Sulawesi relatively recently via Australia. A 2010 analysis of <b>retroposon</b> insertion sites in the nuclear DNA {{of a variety of}} marsupials has confirmed all living marsupials have South American ancestors. The branching sequence of marsupial orders indicated by the study puts Didelphimorphia in the most basal position, followed by Paucituberculata, then Microbiotheria, and ending with the radiation of Australian marsupials. This indicates that Australidelphia arose in South America, and reached Australia after Microbiotheria split off.|$|E
5000|$|Gould and Brosius {{took the}} concept of {{exaptation}} to the genetic level. It is possible {{to look at a}} <b>retroposon,</b> originally thought to be simply junk DNA, and deduce that it may have gotten a new function to be termed as an exaptation. Given an emergency situation in the past, a species may have used junk DNA for a useful purpose in order to evolve and be able to survive. This may have occurred with mammalian ancestors when confronted with a large mass extinction about 250 million years ago and a substantial increase in the level of oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere. More than 100 loci {{have been found to be}} conserved only among mammalian genomes and are thought to have essential roles in the generation of features such as the placenta, diaphragm, mammary glands, neocortex, and auditory ossicles. It is believed that as a result of exaptation, or making previously [...] "useless" [...] DNA into DNA that could be used in order to increase survival chance, mammals were able to generate new brain structures as well as behavior to better survive the mass extinction and adapt to a new life.|$|E

Since then, BovB retroposons have proliferated and today occupy {{a quarter of}} the cow’s genome sequence. The BovB-related short interspersed elements (SINEs) were used for resolving the phylogeny of Bovinae (cows, spiral-horned antelopes, and nilgais) and their relatives. In silico screening of 55, 000 intronic <b>retroposon</b> insertions in the cow genome and experimental validation of 126 introns resulted in 29 informative <b>retroposon</b> markers for resolving bovine evolutionary relationships.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to retrotransposons, they never encode reverse transcriptase (RT) (but see below). Therefore, they are non-autonomous elements {{with regard to}} transposition activity (as opposed to transposons).Non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons such as the human LINE1 elements are sometimes falsely referred to as <b>retroposons.</b> However, this depends on the author. For example, Howard Temin published the following definition: <b>Retroposons</b> encode RT but are devoid of long terminal repeats (LTRs), for example Long interspersed elements (LINEs). Retrotransposons also feature LTRs and retroviruses, in addition, are packaged as viral particles (virions). Retrosequences are non-autonomous elements devoid of RT. They are retroposed {{with the aid of}} the machinery of autonomous elements, such as LINEs; examples are Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) or mRNA-derived retrogenes.|$|R
40|$|TOC 1, a {{transposable element}} from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, is 5662 bases long. The 217 and 237 base long {{terminal}} repeat sequences of TOC 1 are unusually arranged around the 4600 and 123 base unique regions: [217]- 4600 -[237] [217]- 123 -[237]. Although TOC 1 contains {{long terminal repeat}}s and most TOC 1 elements are complete, features shared with virus-like <b>retroposons,</b> its unique 4600 base region is more similar {{to the structure of}} the L 1 family of non-virus retroposons: first, 11 3 / 4 tandemly repeated copies of a 76 base repeat are found 813 bases from the left end of TOC 1, and second using the universal genetic code large open reading frames were not found in TOC 1. The relationship between TOC 1, virus-like <b>retroposons</b> and the L 1 family of non-virus <b>retroposons</b> is unclear and may be very distant since only poor similarity was found between the TOC 1 encoded ORFs and retrovirus polypeptides. The length of the tandem array of 76 base repeat sequences was conserved in most TOC 1 elements and solo 76 base repeat sequences were not found outside TOC 1 elements in the C. reinhardtii genome.

We investigated whether any <b>retroposon</b> genomes possibly encode multiple endonuclease functions. Amino acid alignments were generated and analyzed for the presence of the characterized ordered-series-of-motifs (OSM) representative of four different endonuclease functions. The results indicate that SLACS, CZAR, CRE 1, CRE 2, and some Trypanosoma brucei <b>retroposon</b> sequences encode multiple putative endonuclease functions.

Rather, the ends consisted of two halves of a previously described 512 -base-pair transposable element (G. Hasan, M. J. Turner, and J. S. Cordingley, Cell 37 : 333 - 341, 1984). Oligo(dA) tails and possible insertion site duplications suggested that ingi is a <b>retroposon.</b> The sequenced element appears to be a pseudogene copy of an original <b>retroposon</b> with one or more open reading frames occupying most of its length.

40|$|The {{homogenous}} mammalian order Lagomorpha comprises about 80 {{species in}} two families, Ochotonidae (pikas) and Leporidae (rabbits and hares). However, the phylogenetic relationships among leporids are controversial. Molecular data, particularly from mitochondrial sequences, give highly homoplasious signals. To resolve the controversy between mitochondrial and nuclear data, we analyzed genomic orthologous <b>retroposon</b> insertion sites, a virtually homoplasy-free marker system. From a differential screen of rabbit genomic data for intronic <b>retroposon</b> insertions of CSINE elements, we polymerase chain reaction–amplified and sequenced 11 retroposons in eight representative lagomorphs. We found three retroposons shared among all lagomorphs but absent in outgroups, four confirmed the monophyly of leporids, and three significantly supported Pronolagus as the sister group {{to all other}} leporids. One <b>retroposon</b> supported the monophyly of Lepus.

40|$|AbstractIn the rodent species Microtus cabrerae, males {{as well as}} females present several {{copies of}} the SRY gene, a single-copy gene located on the Y {{chromosome}} in most mammals.

All copies of SRY analyzed, including those from the Y chromosome, proved to be nonfunctional pseudogenes, as they have internal stop codons. In addition, we demonstrated the association of SRY pseudogenes with different fragments of L 1 and LTR retroelements in both sex chromosomes of M. cabrerae. Examining the possible origin of SRY pseudogene and <b>retroposons</b> association, we propose that <b>retroposons</b> could {{have been involved in}} the mechanism of SRY gene amplification on the Y chromosome and in the transference of the Y-linked SRY copies to the X-chromosome heterochromatin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We have {{recently}} identified two large families of extinct transposable elements termed Short Interspersed DEgenerated <b>Retroposons</b> (SIDERs) in the parasitic protozoan Leishmania major. The characterization of SIDER elements {{was limited to}} the SIDER 2 subfamily, although members of both subfamilies have been shown {{to play a role in}} the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Apparent functional domestication of SIDERs prompted further investigation of their characterization, dissemination and evolution throughout the Leishmania genus, with particular attention to the disregarded SIDER 1 subfamily. Results Using optimized statistical profiles of both SIDER 1 and SIDER 2 subgroups, we report the first automated and highly sensitive annotation of SIDERs in the genomes of L. infantum, L. braziliensis and L. major. SIDER annotations were combined to in-silico mRNA extremity predictions to generate a detailed distribution map of the repeat family, hence uncovering an enrichment of antisense-oriented SIDER repeats between the polyadenylation and trans -splicing sites of intergenic regions, in contrast to the exclusive sense orientation of SIDER elements within 3 'UTRs. Our data indicate that SIDER elements are quite uniformly dispersed throughout all three genomes and that their distribution is generally syntenic. However, only 47. 4 % of orthologous genes harbor a SIDER element in all three species. There is evidence for species-specific enrichment of SIDERs and for their preferential association, especially for SIDER 2 s, with different metabolic functions. Investigation of the sequence attributes and evolutionary relationship of SIDERs to other trypanosomatid <b>retroposons</b> reveals that SIDER 1 is a truncated version of extinct autonomous ingi -like <b>retroposons</b> (DIREs), which were functional in the ancestral Leishmania genome. Conclusion A detailed characterization of the sequence traits for both SIDER subfamilies unveils major differences. The SIDER 1 subfamily is more heterogeneous and shows an evolutionary link with vestigial DIRE <b>retroposons</b> as previously observed for the ingi /RIME and L 1 Tc/NARTc couples identified in the T. brucei and T. cruzi genomes, whereas no identified DIREs are related to SIDER 2 sequences. Although SIDER 1 s and SIDER 2 s display equivalent genomic distribution globally, the varying degrees of sequence conservation, preferential genomic disposition, and differential association to orthologous genes allude to an intricate web of SIDER assimilation in these parasitic organisms. </p...|$|R

40|$|The genomic {{sequence}} on mouse Chromosome (Chr) 2 corresponding to a previously identified novel cDNA has been characterized. The genomic organization of this locus, {{adjacent to the}} beta 2 microglobulin gene, has the properties of a processed gene or <b>retroposon</b> including {{the presence of a}} short flanking direct repeat, a polyadenylation signal/poly A tract, and the absence of introns. Analysis of inbred and wild-derived Mus DNAs reveals the <b>retroposon</b> to be a feature only of M. m. domesticus subspecies, suggesting that the insertion event is relatively recent. This notion is supported by the presence of an open reading frame and the lack of sequence divergence in the flanking direct repeats. The complex chromatin configuration characteristic of this region in mouse and human is not, therefore, related to this cDNA. The cognate parental gene encoding the cDNA was mapped to Chr 11.

40|$|The human {{phosphoglycerate kinase}} (Pgk) gene family {{includes}} the functional, Intronless Pgk- 2 gene and the intronless - 1 pseudogene, {{both of which}} are retroposons of the intron-containing Pgk- 1 gene. The divergence of the Pgk- 2 <b>retroposon</b> from Pgk- 1 is compared with that of the 4 >hPgk- 1 <b>retroposon</b> from Pgk- 1 to reveal nucleotide characteristics diagnostic of functional genes. A comparison of the human and mouse Pgk genes indicates that Pgk- 2 has evolved more rapidly than Pgk- 1 since the two genes diverged early in mammalian evolution, but that the lack of Introns in Pgk- 2 may have diminished inter-exon variation. The hypothesis that codon bias is related to expression level is shown not to hold for the Pgk genes; however, the idea that a deficiency of TA and CG dinucleotides and an excess of TG and CT dinucleotides contributes to codon bias is supported. Finally, the hypothesis that the Pgk- 2 <b>retroposon</b> initially included a copy of the Pgk- 1 'housekeeping' promoter and subsequently evolved a tissue-specific promoter Is examined and supported. It Is concluded that this process Involved the loss of the 5 ' CpG island present in the Pgk- 1 gene, and that selection for cell type-specific expression of Pgk- 2 at high levels has driven the divergence of this <b>retroposon</b> from its progenitor, Pgk- 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to their central function in protein biosynthesis, tRNAs also play a pervasive role in genome evolution and architecture because of their extensive ability to serve as templates for retroposition. Close to half {{of the human genome}} consists of discernible transposable elements, a vast majority of which are derived from RNA via reverse transcription and genomic integration. Apart from the presence of direct repeats (DRs) that flank the integrated sequence of <b>retroposons,</b> genomic integrations are usually marked by an oligo(A) tail. Here, we describe a novel class of <b>retroposons</b> that lack A-tails and are therefore termed tailless retropseudogenes. Analysis of ∼ 2500 tRNA-related young tailless retropseudogene sequences revealed that they comprise processed and unprocessed (pre-) tRNAs, 3 ′-truncated in their loop regions, or truncated tRNA-derived SINE RNAs. Surprisingly, their mostly nonrandom integration is dependent on the priming of reverse transcription at sites determined by their 3 ′-terminal 2 - 18 nucleotides and completely independent from oligoadenylation of the template RNA. Thus, tailless retropseudogenes point to a novel, variant mechanism for the biogenesis of retrosequences...|$|R
40|$|Three {{families}} of tRNA-derived repeated <b>retroposons</b> in the genomes of salmonid {{species have been}} isolated and characterized.

The charr Fok I family is present only in four species and subspecies of the genus Salvelinus. The third family, the salmonid Hpa I family, appears to be present in all salmonid species but is not present in species that are not members of the Salmonidae. Thus, the genome of proto-Salmonidae was originally shaped by amplification and dispersion of the salmonid Hpa I family and then reshaped by amplification of the Sma I and Fok I families in the more recently evolved species of salmon and charr, respectively.

40|$|In a human genome, {{we found}} {{dispersed}} repetitive sequences homologous to {{part of a}} human endogenous retrovirus termed HERV-K which resembled mouse mammary tumor virus.

40|$|We {{report that}} 18 conserved, and by {{extension}} functional, elements in the human genome {{are the result of}} <b>retroposon</b> insertions that are evolving under purifying selection in mammals. We show evidence that 1 of the 18 elements regulates the expression of ASXL 3 during development by encoding an alternatively spliced exon that causes nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript. The <b>retroposon</b> that gave rise to these functional elements was quickly inactivated in the mammalian ancestor, and all traces of it have been lost due to neutral decay. However, the tuatara has maintained a near-ancestral version of this <b>retroposon</b> in its extant genome, which allows us to connect the 18 human elements to the evolutionary events that created them. We propose that conservation efforts over more than 100 years may not have only prevented the tuatara from going extinct but could have preserved our ability to understand the evolutionary history of functional elements in the human genome. Through simulations, we argue that species with historically low population sizes are more likely to harbor ancient mobile elements {{for long periods of time}} and in near-ancestral states, making these species indispensable in understanding the evolutionary origin of functional elements in the human genome...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} Asian colobines is less understood. Although monophyly of the odd-nosed monkeys was recently confirmed, the relationships among the langur genera Presbytis, Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus and their position among Asian colobines remained unclear. Moreover, in Trachypithecus various species groups are recognized, but their affiliations are still disputed. To address these issues, mitochondrial and Y chromosomal sequence data were phylogenetically related and combined with presence/absence analyses of <b>retroposon</b> integrations. Results The analysed 5 kb fragment of the mitochondrial genome allows no resolution of the phylogenetic relationships among langur genera, but five <b>retroposon</b> integrations were detected which link Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus. According to Y chromosomal data and a 573 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, a common origin of the species groups T. [cristatus], T. [obscurus] and T. [francoisi] and their reciprocal monophyly is supported, which is also underpinned by an orthologous <b>retroposon</b> insertion. T. [vetulus] clusters within Semnopithecus, which is confirmed by two <b>retroposon</b> integrations. Moreover, this species group is paraphyletic, with T. vetulus forming a clade with the Sri Lankan, and T. johnii with the South Indian form of S. entellus. Incongruence between gene trees was detected for T. [pileatus], in that Y chromosomal data link it with T. [cristatus], T. [obscurus] and T. [francoisi], whereas mitochondrial data affiliates it with the Semnopithecus clade. Conclusion Neither relationships among the three langur genera nor their position within Asian colobines can be settled with 5 kb mitochondrial sequence data, but <b>retroposon</b> integrations confirm at least a common origin of Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus. According to Y chromosomal and 573 bp mitochondrial sequence data, T. [cristatus], T. [obscurus] and T. [francoisi] represent true members of the genus Trachypithecus, whereas T. [vetulus] clusters within Semnopithecus. Due to paraphyly of T. [vetulus] and polyphyly of Semnopithecus, a split of the genus into three species groups (S. entellus - North India, S. entellus - South India + T. johnii, S. entellus - Sri Lanka + T. vetulus) seems to be appropriate. T. [pileatus] posses an intermediate position between both genera, indicating that the species group might {{be the result of}} ancestral hybridization. </p...|$|E

[1998 : Am. J. Med. Genet. (Neuropsychiatr. Genet.) 81 : 420 - 427]. Within the block of homology with Yp that was generated by a transposition between the chimpanzee and Homo sapiens we find two sequences, HS 307 and HS 408, {{with a high degree}} of homology to but not identity with the schizophrenic brain cDNA. The closest match of these three sequences is to a family of <b>retroposons,</b> that has evolved from the HERV-K family of endogenous retroviruses, some members of which (e. g., SINE- R. C 2) appear to be specific to the human genome. This element has been reported as a cause of Fukuyama-type muscular dystrophy [Kobayashi et al., 1998 : Nature 394 : 388 - 392]. Such <b>retroposons,</b> as agents of change in the human genome, provide a strategy for investigating pathogenesis. On account of their genomic location in a region that has been subject to change in the course of hominid evolution, and that may have a relationship to psychosis and/or cerebral asymmetry, we conclude that these particular insertions deserve further investigation. ope...|$|R
40|$|Small {{nucleolar}} RNAs (snoRNAs) of the H/ACA box and C/D box categories {{guide the}} pseudouridylation and the 2 ′-O-ribose methylation of ribosomal RNAs by forming short duplexes with their target. Similarly, small Cajal body–specific RNAs (scaRNAs) guide modifications of spliceosomal RNAs. The {{vast majority of}} vertebrate sno/scaRNAs are located in introns of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II and processed by exonucleolytic trimming after splicing. A bioinformatic search for orthologues of human sno/scaRNAs in sequenced mammalian genomes reveals the presence of species- or lineage-specific sno/scaRNA <b>retroposons</b> (sno/scaRTs) characterized by an A-rich tail and an ∼ 14 -bp target site duplication that corresponds to their insertion site, as determined by interspecific genomic alignments. Three classes of snoRTs are defined based {{on the extent of}} intron and exon sequences from the snoRNA parental host gene they contain. SnoRTs frequently insert in gene introns in the sense orientation at genomic hot spots shared with other genetic mobile elements. Previously characterized human snoRNAs are encoded in <b>retroposons</b> whose parental copies can be identified by phylogenic analysis, showing that snoRTs can be faithfully processed. These results identify snoRNAs as a new family of mobile genetic elements. The insertion of new snoRNA copies might constitute a safeguard mechanism by which the biological activity of snoRNAs is maintained in spite of the risk of mutations in the parental copy. I furthermore propose that retroposition followed by genetic drift is a mechanism that increased snoRNA diversity during vertebrate evolution to eventually acquire new RNA-modification functions...|$|R
