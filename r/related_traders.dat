This research is a descriptive study. The method used in this research is survey and the correspondents were determined with the purposive sampling method consisting bureaucrats, academics, farmers, and <b>related</b> <b>traders.</b> The result of the research shows that the main strength factor is the availability of a proper pineapples cultivation manual (score: 0. 4898). The main weakness factor is unefficient management farmer system (score: 0. 2117). The main opportunity factor is the availability of a sustainable development program and the main threat factor is the competitiveness of the product with imported fruits which was still low (score 0. 2016). Based on the analysis there are six alternative strategies for the development of pineapples agribusiness in Kubu Raya Regency, West Kalimantan, i. e., 1) the enhancement of pineapple production through training and counseling based on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Standar Operational Procedure (SOP) as well as an expansion of the planting area; 2) the enhancement and control {{of the quality of the}} product; 3) The enhancement of the production system efficiency; 4) the control of the production from a pest infestation; 5) Developing a partnership pattern and; 6) developing agricultural institutions function.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} illusory control beliefs {{on the performance of}} traders in financial instruments. The authors argue that the task and environment faced by traders are conducive to the development of illusions of control and that individual propensity to illusion of control will be (inversely) <b>related</b> to <b>trader</b> performance. Using an innovative computer task, designed to assess illusion of control in the field, data from 107 traders in four organizations showed individual differences in this bias to have a significant, inverse, association with performance, as measured by managers' ratings of trader performance and by total remuneration. The authors conclude that, at least in this context, illusion of control is maladaptive and that it is productive to take an individual difference approach to the study of such illusions. Implications for debates about {{the costs and benefits of}} positive illusions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Technical {{analysis}} {{is a technique}} used by many share traders {{in their quest to}} make profits on financial markets. This paper, drawing on qualitative research which focused on non-professional traders, theorizes how the technique represents an extension of the theory of the epistemic consumption object proposed by Zwick and Dholakia (2006 a). It is proposed that technical {{analysis is}} a “second-order” epistemic consumption object. Technical analysis relies for its existence upon financial markets - indeterminate objects to which traders have been able to orient themselves due primarily to their visual, on-screen presence. But visual manifestations of technical analysis allow it to usurp the role of financial markets, and be conceived of as the primary object to which <b>traders</b> <b>relate,</b> even as the constantly changing information upon which technical analysis relies highlights its incompleteness. This role as a second-order epistemic consumption object is reinforced by the commodification of technical analysis, whereby the technique is marketed as a consumer product that can be constantly updated, refined, and renewed by the proliferation of consumer products and services available...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{multiple}} stressors in Africa often focus on vulnerable inland communities. Rising concentrations of the world’s poor live in coastal rural–urban areas with direct dependencies on marine {{as well as}} terrestrial ecosystem goods and services. Using participatory methods we elicited perceptions of stressors and their sources, impacts and consequences held by coastal communities in eastern Africa (Mtwara in Tanzania and Maputo in Mozambique). Respondent-informed timelines suggest wars, economic policies and natural increase have led to natural resource-dependent populations in marginal, previously little-inhabited lowland coastal areas. Respondents (n = 91) in interviews and focus groups rank climate stressors (temperature rise/erratic rain) highest amongst human/natural stressors having negative impacts on livelihoods and wellbeing (e. g., cross-scale cost of living increases including food and fuel prices). Sources of stress and impacts were mixed in time and space, complicating objective identification of causal chains. Some appeared to be specific to coastal areas. Respondents reported farms failing and rising dependence on stressed marine resources, food and fuel prices and <b>related</b> dependence on <b>traders</b> and credit shrunk by negative global market trends. Development {{in the guise of}} tourism and conservation projects limited access to land–sea livelihoods and resources in rural–urban areas (coastal squeeze). Mental modelling clarified resource user perceptions of complex linkages from local to international levels. We underline risks of the poor in marginal coastal areas facing double or multiple exposures to multiple stressors, with climate variability suggesting the risks of climate change...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{is a key}} aspect for {{evaluating}} the performance of commodity chains. Quality performance depends on both subjective consumer perceptions as well as intrinsic attributes of the product. Supply chain procedures and management activities influence the quality level and may reduce or increase the heterogeneity in product quality. In additional to technological measures, timely access to information on market and management options can be helpful to reduce human-related variability. In this article we present an explorative framework for disentangling the interactions between different managerial activities that {{have an effect on}} quality variability in mangoes. We use data dispersion statistics to understand the impact of technological and socio-economic factors on heterogeneity in quality performance at different stages of the supply chain. Based on a field survey amongst 51 different agents involved in the mango chain from Costa Rica, information regarding production technologies, agroecological conditions, management intensity, quality control, contracting practices and marketing operations is collected. We also tested randomly 10 mangoes from each agent to analyze the variability in quality attributes, focusing on the ratio between Brix and pH. We find that quality heterogeneity is influenced both by technological variability and by socio-economic diversity. In the mango supply chain from Costa Rica, management differences amongst agents vary depending on the upstream and downstream relationships. Agents <b>related</b> to international <b>traders</b> tend to maintain lowest variability in their management practices {{in order to be able}} to respond better to consumer demands. Effective linkages with downstream agents are thus critical to guarantee appropriate incentives for managing quality in upstream segment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The {{aim of this study}} is to contribute to decision theory and to provide information valuable to management in finance. This research seeks to clarify and measure the decision styles of traders, whose work demands quick and balanced judgement under conditions of risk and uncertainty. A valid taxonomy of individuals' psychological preferences and decision style and a systematic analysis of which behaviours are likely to occur under what conditions for which individual could aid selection, placement and management systems. The aim of the project was to develop a new measure based on previous research which indicated that decision style is likely to compromise a number of psychological constructs. The measure would focus on risk dispositions, cognitive orientations and emotional involvement. Two further measures would collect data concerning the organisational-level processes of recruitment and placement of new employees and measure individual-level performance. Longitudinal performance data would also be gathered to examine change over time. The sample comprised investment banks and fund management companies. Data would be gathered from firms with different roles in the industry to enable similarities and differences across firms to be examined. Feedback from the project would have academic and practical value, taking the form of academic papers and company-specific reports. The dataset held at the Archive does not contain all the data collected during the project - some restricted-use personality test data are not included. Main Topics : The dataset contains data <b>relating</b> to 118 <b>traders</b> sampled from four investment banks. The data represent a number of issues which influence the decision-making process and trader performance. Six different methods of data collection were used: biographical information; personality data gathered using a standardised measure (these data are not included in the dataset held at the Archive); a newly-developed measure (Risk Assessment Tool); self-ratings on four aspects of performance; managers' ratings of traders on the same four aspects of performance and questionnaire data relating to perceptions of pay. The data enable assessment of relationships between a number of individual difference factors. For further details about the variables, please see documentation...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} {{an aspect of}} indigenous Nigerian entrepreneurship, focusing on the cross-border trade in South-Western Nigeria. An almost total ignorance of how the traders go about their business, coupled with an unwelcoming trading environment, appear to have caused the antipathy of policy planners, and dearth of academic research in the area. The dearth of research is of particular concern here hence the need to "go back to basics", as it were, and focus the research in the first instance, on what the trade is in fact all about. The study focuses therefore on a descriptive analysis of the cross-border trade itself as an indigenous exporting activity, in particular {{the role of the}} small businesses who, in numerical terms at least, dominate the trade. It is expected that this will lead to future, more sector and area-specific studies on the subject. The cross-border trade takes place in an environment of illegality, corruption, and an unstable local economy, which makes trading conditions difficult, and would ordinarily seem to prevent traders from exercising their enterprise other than for mere survival on the economic fringes. Policy planners are also quick to argue that the trade is merely a smugglers' arena that contributes nothing to national development and in fact needs to be eliminated in aid of the development process. These reinforce the development literature which envisages only a limited role for indigenous entrepreneurship in economic development. The findings in this study however suggest another interpretation. It is argued that the trading environment as it is in fact provides opportunities which seem to have encouraged the emergence of an entrepreneurial class, and that though largely invisible, greater capital accumulation than is usually thought appears to be taking place, suggesting a more significant role for indigenous entrepreneurs in the development process. Between chapters 1 and 5, a case is presented for why existing trade and development theories have only a limited application to the development process in less developed countries like Nigeria. Chapters 6 and 7 introduce the surveys which indicate the performance and strategy of a sample of producers and traders. Subsequently relying mainly, but not exclusively on anthropologically-oriented material, the study focuses, in chapters 8 and 9, on the actors and activities in three cross-border trade routes, exploring {{the ways in which the}} <b>traders</b> <b>relate</b> to one another and to other participants in the trade. Further attention is paid to the ways in which the trade survives, evolves and develops, in spite of considerable environmental difficulties. While the study does not dispute that there are several smugglers and other law-breakers in the cross-border trade traffic, it argues further that considerable legitimate, but unrecorded trade goes on across the borders by several dedicated producers and traders. Certain theoretical implications arising from the study are discussed as areas for further study, while other, more practical recommendations, are suggested to policy planners, which may be beneficial both to them and to the traders in the future developments of the trade...|$|R
