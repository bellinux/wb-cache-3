40|$|The {{strength}} of float glass {{is a necessary}} engineering parameter. Determining this strength is a complex problem. Earlier results have shown that statistically bending test results are not a homogeneous group. To explain this, a theoiy of "hidden damage" is proposed. The essence of this {{theory is that the}} different sides of float glass are unequal, {{not only because of the}} differences between the Tin and nitrogen sides, but because of the difference between the side scored under the sheet glass cutting and the side which has the crack propagation ftom the scored side in breaking. Extensive tests on <b>rolled</b> <b>glass</b> suggest that the rolling process damages the glass in a special way, causing "invisible" damage - statistically not a homogeneous distribution of micro-cracks on the edge surface of glass element. These micro-cracks are different on the scored and broken sides of glass. They are the fracture source under the loading and influence negatively on glass element strength and statistics of strength data. This "invisible" damage explains most if not all of the non-homogenous distribution of the test results. It is shown that removal of this damage on the edges of glass elements increases the engineering {{strength of}} float glass significantly. Building TechnologyArchitectur...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{nanostructure}} and nonlinear {{optical properties}} of high-niobium glasses in the (1 − x) KNbO 3 -xSiO 2 system with an SiO 2 content x = 0. 05 - 0. 35 {{have been studied}} by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), electron microscopy (EM), and second-optical-harmonic generation (SHG). Vitreous samples are manufactured by the methods of fast melt cooling (pressing with metal plates and quenching between rotating <b>rolls).</b> <b>Glasses</b> with x 0. 2 are homogeneous, but form a silica-enriched nanostructure after thermal treatments. At temperatures below ∼T g + 50 °C, silica-enriched regions manifest a very slight tendency to grow, whereas, according to SANS and X-ray diffraction data, their chemical composition is observed to shift appreciably towards SiO 2 with thermal treatment. The obtained data on an inhomogeneous structure allows us to clarify the complicated character of the previously revealed dependence T g (x). Nano-inhomogeneous transparent samples produce a weak SHG signal, which indicates the quasi-periodic modulation of the chemical composition and, correspondingly, polarizability, in the volume of glass. The nonlinear optical phase KNbO 3 precipitates at later stages of crystallization, when a glass loses its transparency. In this case, the SHG signal is amplified by several orders of magnitude...|$|R

40|$|Glass ionomer cement with {{addition}} of chlorhexidine {{used as a}} varnish on tooth surfaces {{has been shown to}} reduce the number of inter-proximal mutans streptococci (ms). The effect of a single application of such a varnish containing 2. 5 % chlorhexidine on occlusal caries development of the first permanent molars on 6 -year-old children in a high caries incidence area was investigated. The children were examined according to WHO criteria and 262 children with 2 caries free contralateral molars were selected for treatment. Salivary ms samples were collected using the Strip-mutans (SM) method. After brushing the occlusal surfaces with a toothbrush and pumice in water slurry, rinsing and drying with a cotton <b>roll,</b> <b>glass</b> ionomer cement containing chlorhexidine (GI-CHX) and glass ionomer (GI) were applied randomly with a micro brush and the varnish was covered with occlusal wax. At baseline, the mean defs was 18. 18 and DMFS was 0. 25 and after one year 18. 24 and 0. 83 respectively. The salivary ms scores were high or very high (SM 2 and 3) in 85. 6 % at baseline. At the one-year follow up, the GI-CHX and GI materials could not be detected in the fissures. Also, a large number of fissure sealants had been placed in the molars outside the study protocol; thus 4 % of the GI-CHX and GI, and 70 % of the untreated were sealed at year one. Overall, there was no significant difference between the caries-reducing effect of GI-CHX and GI, but a trend towards a higher effect was seen for GI-CHX. Excluding the sealed molars the reduction was 74 % in the GI-CHX-group, and 71 % in the GI-group. Conclusion: Addition of 2. 5 % chlorhexidine to glass ionomer did not seem to increase the caries-reducing effect of the varnish in this high caries incidence population...|$|R
