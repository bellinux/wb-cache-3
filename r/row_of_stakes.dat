60|$|Having {{mastered}} this difficulty, {{and employed}} {{a world of}} time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two other wants. I had no vessel to hold any thing that was liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of rum; and some glass bottles, some of the common size, and others (which were case-bottles) square, for the holding of waters, spirits, &c. I had {{not so much as}} a pot to boil anything; except a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which was too big for such use as I desired it, viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing I would fain have had, was a tobacco-pipe; but it was impossible for me to make one; however, I found a contrivance for that too at last. I employed myself in planting my second <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes</b> or piles, and also in this wicker-working, all the summer or dry season; when another business took me up more time than it could be imagined I could spare.|$|E
60|$|I kept myself {{employed}} in planting my second <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes,</b> But remembering that when I travelled {{up to the}} brook, I had a mind {{to see the whole}} island, I now resumed my intention, and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two biscuit cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a larger quantity of powder and shot than usual, I began my journey. Having passed the vale where my bower stood, I came within view of the sea lying to the west when it being a clear day, I fairly descried land, extending from the W. to the S.W. about ten or fifteen leagues, as I concluded; but could not say whether it was an island or a continent.--Neither could I tell what this place might be; only thought it was part of America, & where I might have been in a miserable condition, had I landed. Again I considered that if this was the Spanish coast, certainly, one time or other, I should see some ship pass by; and if it was not, then it must be the savage coast, between the Spanish country and Brazil, which abounds with cannibals or man-eaters.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1442, a {{wall was}} erected by the Ming in Liaodong to protect Han {{settlers}} from a possible {{threat from the}} Jurched-Mongol Oriyanghan. In 146768, expansion of the wall provided further protection for the region from against attacks by the Jianzhou Jurchens in the northeast. An offshoot of the future main Great Wall line, this [...] "Liaodong Wall" [...] was of simple design: {{for the most part}} constructed by pouring mud between parallel <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes,</b> with moats dug on both sides, although stones and tiles were used in some parts.|$|R

60|$|The whole party {{followed}} Franco, who {{led them}} out to the shore the shortest way. They took Isaiah and his mother to the house, and gave them some supper, and let them stay there that night. The next morning, when Jonas got up, he found that it was clearing away; and when, after breakfast, he looked out upon the pond, {{to see if he could}} see any thing of his sled, he observed, away out half a mile from shore, two short <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes,</b> sticking up in the snow, not far from on island.

6000|$|The plot! A good plot is {{that sure}} edifice which slowly rises {{out of the}} interplay of {{circumstance}} on temperament, and temperament on circumstance, within the enclosing atmosphere of an idea. A human being is the best plot there is; it may be impossible to see why {{he is a good}} plot, because the idea within which he was brought forth cannot be fully grasped; but it is plain that he is a good plot. He is organic. And so it must be with a good play. Reason alone produces no good plots; they come by original sin, sure conception, and instinctive after-power of selecting what benefits the germ. A bad plot, on the other hand, is simply a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes,</b> with a character impaled on each--characters who would have liked to live, but came to untimely grief; who started bravely, but fell on these stakes, placed beforehand in a row, and were transfixed one by one, while their ghosts stride on, squeaking and gibbering, through the play. Whether these stakes are made of facts or of ideas, according {{to the nature of the}} dramatist who planted them, their effect on the unfortunate characters is the same; the creatures were begotten to be staked, and staked they are! The demand for a good plot, not unfrequently heard, commonly signifies: [...] "Tickle my sensations by stuffing the play with arbitrary adventures, so that I need not be troubled to take the characters seriously. Set the persons of the play to action, regardless of time, sequence, atmosphere, and probability!" ...|$|E
60|$|My mother wept bitterly, {{declaring that}} the evil days she had seen in England were {{pursuing}} her to France; and we could not persuade her {{that we were in}} no danger, until the populace, having done their worst at the Hotel de Luynes, drifted away from our street. Eustace could not of course bear to stay shut up and knowing nothing, and he and the Abbe both went out different ways, leaving us to devour our anxiety as best we could, knowing nothing but that there was a chain across each end of our street, with a double <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes</b> on either side, banked up with earth, stones, straw, all sorts of things, and guarded by men with all manner of queer old weapons that had come down from the wars of the League. Eustace even came upon one of the old-fashioned arquebuses standing on three legs to be fired; and, what was worse, there was a gorget with the portrait of the murderer of Henri III. enameled on it, and the inscription 'S. Jacques Clement,' but the Coadjutor had the horrible thing broken up publicly. My brother said things did indeed remind him of the rusty old weapons that were taken down {{at the beginning of the}} Rebellion. He had been to M. Darpent's, and found him exceedingly busy, and had learned from him that the Coadjutor was at the bottom of all this day's disturbance. Yes, Archbishop de Gondi himself. He had been bitterly offended at the mocking, mistrustful way in which his services had been treated, and besides, reports came to him that Cardinal talked of sending him of Quimper Corentin, and Broussel to Havre, and the Chancellor to dismiss the Parliament! He had taken counsel with his friends, and determined to put himself and the head of the popular movement and be revenged upon the Court, and one of his familiar associates, M. d'Argenteuil, had disguised himself as a mason, and led the attack with a rule in his hand, while a lady, Madame Martineau, had beaten the drum and collected the throng to guard the gates and attack the Chancellor. There were, it was computed, no less than 1260 barricades all over Paris, and the Parliament was perfectly amazed at the excitement produced by the capture of Broussel. Finding that they had such supporters, the Parliament was more than ever determined to make a stand for its rights--whatever they might be.|$|E

50|$|If a {{break or}} leak was {{discovered}} {{and the level}} walker could not do repair it himself, he {{sent a message to}} the section superintendent or headquarters, and the section crew with a repair scow would come. These boats carried clay straw, takes, rope, wooden boards, and tools (picks & shovels). For culverts and flood gates, a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> heavy planks, interlocked with tongue and groove, would be driven across the canal (similar to a cofferdam) above and below the break, and would swell when wet. After the water drained out through the break, it would be repaired. If the break was in the bank or berm of the canal, the crew would drive two <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes,</b> about a foot apart, across the breach, then weaving rope between them. Straw was put in it, and that would slow or stop the water flow. A <b>row</b> <b>of</b> planks were then driven to stop the flow, and then the break would be filled with dirt and rocks.|$|R

Morgan, during which the sockets of rows of timber stakes were found {{around the edge of the}} bank which indicated that there was a heavy defensive palisade once located there. Morgan made three cuts into the bank, revealing a 2.5 m deep v-shaped ditch in the rampart and identifying the location of two separate rows of stakes some 1.83 m apart. The forward <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes</b> measured between 6.4 - 11.4 cm in diameter, and were placed an average of 30 cm apart from each other. The rear row was less uniform. While no evidence was found of a building on top of the mound, late 12th/early 13th century pottery shards were discovered, along with a belt buckle and the soles of leather shoes.|$|E
5000|$|Uhlenburg {{consisted}} of a small inner ward and a large outer ward that adjoined its northern side. The almost square inner bailey was built on a motte with sides some 30 metres long. Today it only has a height of about 1.5 metres and a pond borders it to the south. In 2004 {{the banks of the}} pond were reinforced with stones to prevent erosion. West of the motte a rampart guards the ditch. The entire complex was surrounded by a castle ditch and {{it is possible that the}} two wards were on islands surrounded by a large area of water. On the eastern side of the motte is a flat depression on an area of 11 x 20 m. An embankment runs from here across the ditch, so it can be assumed that this was the entrance. In the pond a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes</b> was found that belonged to the old castle and could have been part of a palisade.|$|E

60|$|During our encampment here we {{had several}} adventures with the ravenous creatures of that country; {{and had not}} our fire been always kept burning, I {{question}} much whether all our fence, though we strengthened it afterwards with twelve or fourteen <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes</b> or more, would have kept us secure. It {{was always in the}} night that we had the disturbance of them, and sometimes they came in such multitudes that we thought all the lions and tigers, and leopards and wolves of Africa were come together to attack us. One night, being clear moonshine, one of our men being upon the watch, told us that he verily believed he saw ten thousand wild creatures {{of one sort or another}} pass by our little camp, and ever as they saw the fire they sheered off, but were sure to howl or roar, or whatever it was, when they were past.|$|R

A weir, called tatápi, was placed in shallow streams to capture trout, pike and suckers. A <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes</b> were placed {{in the bottom of the}} stream and stones, logs, stumps and dirt was piled up against the stakes so that the water would be dammed and have to pour over the weir and into a trap on the other side. Another weir, the tafsifschi, was used in a larger stream to catch allis (steelhead trout) when they would return to sea in the fall. The tafsifschi consisted of two fence sections which extended from opposite river banks at a down-stream angle; almost meeting mid-river. They were connected by a short section of wall made by lashing horizontal poles close together across the gap. This was the lowest point in the created dam, and water would pour over carrying the fish into the basket on the other side of the gap. Salmon would be caught by spear, seine, or in nets that hung above water falls or dams.|$|E

40|$|The authors examine {{specific}} features of defense {{lines in the}} pre-Mongol medieval forts from the Western Volga region (10 th – early 13 th centuries). Such fortified settlements {{are located in the}} valley of the Sura river, predominantly. The archaeological studies revealed some {{specific features}} of fortification on these sites. However, all of them fit into the general concept of fortifications in the Volga Bulgaria. Most of the forts in this region are located on capes, and thus are compact. Still, they have a complex system of fortifications consisting of one or several (up to three) lines of ramparts with wooden walls and moats. Some of them are arranged as one belt, others consist of separate protective boundaries and divide settlements into internal and external town. Walls had different constructive features and varied between vertical palisades (<b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes)</b> to wooden cages. Suburbs could be protected by a simple wooden wall without any additional earthen fortifications...|$|E

A single value {{was calculated for}} each of the three PMs assuming all poles were 3  m long and 60  mm diameter (midpoint of 50 – 70  mm range), all stakes were 1  m long and 25  mm diameter (20 – 30  mm), and all cuttings were 0.4  m long and 17.5  mm diameter (15 – 20  mm). Units were at 2 -m spacings within two adjacent rows 3  m apart, with two or three buffer <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes</b> planted either side to reduce any border effects. The PMs were planted vertically at depths of 0.3  m for cuttings, 0.5  m for stakes, and 0.8  m for poles to facilitate anchorage of the developing trees in the substrate. Soil surrounding the PM was compacted to reduce the likelihood of air pockets (van Kraayenoord et al. 1986). Weeds, principally grasses (mostly Holcus lanatus L.), but also legumes (e.g. Lotus uliginosus Schkuhr) and other broadleaf species (e.g. Ranunculus repens L.), were controlled by hand-weeding and application of herbicide (glyphosate at 1.8  kg a.i.[*]ha− 1).
