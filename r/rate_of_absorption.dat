25|$|The rate {{at which}} stimulated {{emission}} occurs {{is proportional to the}} number of atoms N2 in the excited state, and the radiation density of the light. The base probability of a photon causing stimulated emission in a single excited atom was shown by Albert Einstein to be exactly equal to the probability of a photon being absorbed by an atom in the ground state. Therefore, when the numbers of atoms in the ground and excited states are equal, the rate of stimulated emission is equal to the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> for a given radiation density.|$|E

This provides a secondary method of making sure that the simulated metabolism has experimentally verified properties rather than just mathematically acceptable ones.|$|E

The conclusion is that potassium and sodium ions are absorbed independently of the anions <b>of</b> the <b>absorption</b> solution in exchange for H+, while anions are exchanged for a base.

25|$|Recall {{from the}} {{descriptions}} of absorption and stimulated emission above that the rates of these two processes are proportional {{to the number of}} atoms in the ground and excited states, N1 and N2, respectively. If the ground state has a higher population than the excited state (N1 > N2), then the absorption process dominates, and there is a net attenuation of photons. If the populations of the two states are the same (N1 = N2), the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> of light exactly balances the rate of emission; the medium is then said to be optically transparent.|$|E
25|$|Atorvastatin {{undergoes}} rapid absorption {{when taken}} orally, with an approximate time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of 1–2 h. The absolute bioavailability {{of the drug}} is about 14%, but the systemic availability for HMG-CoA reductase activity is approximately 30%. Atorvastatin undergoes high intestinal clearance and first-pass metabolism, which is the main cause for the low systemic availability. Administration of atorvastatin with food produces a 25% reduction in Cmax (<b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption)</b> and a 9% reduction in AUC (extent of absorption), although food {{does not affect the}} plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin. Evening dose administration is known to reduce the Cmax and AUC by 30% each. However, time of administration does not affect the plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl transdermal patches (Durogesic/Duragesic) {{are used}} in chronic pain management. The patches work by slowly {{releasing}} fentanyl through the skin into the bloodstream over 48 to 72 hours, allowing for long-lasting pain management. Dosage {{is based on the}} size of the patch, since, in general, the transdermal absorption rate is constant at a constant skin temperature. <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> is dependent on a number of factors. Body temperature, skin type, amount of body fat, and placement of the patch can have major effects. The different delivery systems used by different makers will also affect individual rates of absorption. Under normal circumstances, the patch will reach its full effect within 12 to 24 hours; thus, fentanyl patches are often prescribed with a fast-acting opiate (such as morphine or oxycodone) to handle breakthrough pain.|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper the relative <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> acetic acid and propionic acid through the rumen wall were discussed (Gray, 1947 a). While the manuscript was being prepared, Danielli, Hitchcock, Marshall & Phillipson (1945) described {{a series of}} experiments from which {{it was evident that}} the lower homologues of the fatty acids are absorbed through the rumen wall at different rates when the rumen contents are acid, and that the relative velocities <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> fall in the series butyric> propionic> acetic. The observations made in this laboratory (Gray, 1947 a) independently and by different methods were in agreement with these conclusions. There is therefore no reason to doubt that the higher homologues are absorbed preferentially when the rumen contents are acid.

25|$|Further {{research}} should be conducted in order to fill the gaps in entomotoxicology. Such areas as bioaccumulation, insect metabolism of drugs, and quantitative analyses of insect evidence have only begun to be researched. Because it {{is a relatively new}} branch of forensic entomology, entomotoxicology has its limitations. According to Pounder’s research, there is no correlation between the drug concentration in tissue and the larvae feeding on that tissue. Entomological specimens make for excellent qualitative toxicological specimens. There is, however, a lack of research in the way of developing an assessment that can quantify the concentration of a drug in tissue using entomological evidence. One {{reason for this is that}} a drug can only be detected in larvae when the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> exceeds the rate of elimination. demonstrated this theory using Calliphora vicina larvae reared on human skeletal muscle obtained from cases of co-proxamol and amitriptyline overdose. Samples of pupae and third instar larvae no longer contained concentrations of the drugs, suggesting that drugs do not bioaccumulate over the entire life-cycle of larvae. This leads entomologists to theorize that toxins are eliminated from the larvae’s system over time if they are not receiving a constant supply of the toxin.|$|E
25|$|With {{time as a}} {{critical}} aspect of emergency psychiatry, the rapidity of effect is an important consideration. Pharmacokinetics is the movement of drugs through the body with time and is at least partially reliant upon the route of administration, absorption, distribution and metabolism of the medication. A common route of administration is oral administration, however if this method is to work the drug {{must be able to}} get to the stomach and stay there. In cases of vomiting and nausea this method of administration is not an option. Suppositories can, in some situations, be administered instead. Medication can also be administered through intramuscular injection, or through intravenous injection. The amount of time required for absorption varies dependent upon many factors including drug solubility, gastrointestinal motility and pH. If a medication is administered orally the amount of food in the stomach may also affect the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption.</b> Once absorbed medications must be distributed throughout the body, or usually with the case of psychiatric medication, past the blood–brain barrier to the brain. With all of these factors affecting the rapidity of effect, the time until the effects are evident varies. Generally, though, the timing with medications is relatively fast and can occur within several minutes. As an example, physicians usually expect to see a remission of symptoms thirty minutes after haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is administered intramuscularly. Antipsychotics, especially Haloperidol, as well as assorted benzodiazepines are the most frequently used drugs in emergency psychiatry, especially agitation.|$|E
500|$|French {{scientists}} Hans von Halban, Lew Kowarski, and Frédéric Joliot-Curie {{had demonstrated}} that uranium bombarded by neutrons emitted more neutrons than it absorbed, which implies chain reaction {{may be a}} possibility. Fermi and Anderson did so too a few weeks later. Leó Szilárd obtained [...] of uranium oxide from Canadian radium producer Eldorado Gold Mines Limited, allowing Fermi and Anderson to conduct experiments with fission on a much larger scale. Fermi and Szilárd collaborated on a design of a device to achieve a self-sustaining nuclear reaction—a nuclear reactor. Due to the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> of neutrons by the hydrogen in water, {{it was unlikely that}} a self-sustaining reaction could be achieved with natural uranium and water as a neutron moderator. [...] Fermi suggested, based on his work with neutrons, that the reaction could be achieved with uranium oxide blocks and graphite as a moderator instead of water. This would reduce the neutron capture rate, and in theory make a self-sustaining chain reaction possible. Szilárd came up with a workable design: a pile of uranium oxide blocks interspersed with graphite bricks. Szilárd, Anderson, and Fermi published a paper on [...] "Neutron Production in Uranium". But their work habits and personalities were different, and Fermi had trouble working with Szilárd.|$|E
