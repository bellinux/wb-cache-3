5|$|Groves {{expected}} to have another atomic bomb <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> on 19 August, with three more in September and a further three in October. Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on 11 and 14 August. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until 16 August. It could therefore have been <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> on 19 August. On 10 August, Truman secretly requested that additional atomic bombs not be dropped on Japan without his express authority. Groves suspended the third core's shipment on his own authority on 13 August.|$|E
5|$|Stiffening laths, if used, are attached. Both {{horn and}} laths may be bound and glued with further lengths of sinew. After months of drying the bow is <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use.</b> Further {{finishing}} may include thin leather or waterproof bark, {{to protect the}} bow from moisture, and recent Turkish bows were often highly decorated with colourful paints and gold leaf.|$|E
5|$|Around 7,000people in Cuba were {{evacuated}} {{to avoid the}} oncoming hurricane. Several shelters were opened by the Montserrat Red Cross on Montserrat, but few people sought refuge in them. Over 40shelters were <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in Nassau, Bahamas, even though Debby never affected the island. A total of 889people in the northern coastal plains {{were evacuated}} and placed in shelters out of Debby path. Three shelters were opened for the coming of Debby in Saint Thomas, and another two in Saint John. The total {{number of people in}} all five shelters only reached64. An additional 17people took refuge in an unknown number of shelters on St. Croix.|$|E

5|$|Both the {{character}} and the program were announced to the public via an advertisement in March 2000, though the program was not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> at that time. Despite the announcement generating {{a considerable amount of}} attention, little was heard regarding the project in subsequent months. The program was never officially released nor cancelled, though the trademarks for both Myosphere and Mya were abandoned by Motorola in 2002. The name Mya was believed to be a play on the words 'My assistant'.|$|E
5|$|Built by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), Oroville Dam {{is one of}} the key {{features}} of the California State Water Project (SWP), one of two major projects passed that set up California's statewide water system. Construction was initiated in 1961, and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction, including multiple floods and a major train wreck on the rail line used to transport materials to the dam site, the embankment was topped out in 1967 and the entire project was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in 1968. The dam began to generate electricity shortly afterwards with completion of the Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant, then the country's largest underground power station.|$|E
5|$|Christ Church, {{although}} a larger building than St John's, {{is the daughter}} church in Radyr. Designed by the Llandaff diocesan surveyor George Halliday, the nave was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> at Easter 1904 and the chancel and tower were completed in November 1910. Also in 1910 John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast a ring of eight bells for the tower. Lieutenant Colonel Fisher paid for the bells, and each bell is inscribed {{with the names of}} members of his family.|$|E

5|$|Like its predecessor, CryoSat-2 was {{constructed}} by EADS Astrium, with its main instrument being built by Thales Alenia Space. Construction {{and testing of}} the spacecraft's primary instrument was completed by February 2008, when it was shipped for integration {{with the rest of}} the spacecraft. In August 2009, the spacecraft's ground infrastructure, which had been redesigned since the original mission, was declared <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use.</b> Construction and testing of the spacecraft had been completed by mid-September. The Project Manager for the CryoSat-2 mission was Richard Francis, who had been the Systems Manager on the original CryoSat mission.|$|E
5|$|Morotai's {{development}} into an Allied base began {{shortly after}} the landing, and two major airfields were <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in October. These and other base facilities {{played an important role}} in the Liberation of the Philippines during 1944 and 1945. Torpedo boats and aircraft based at Morotai also harassed Japanese positions in the NEI. The island's base facilities were further expanded in 1945 to support the Australian-led Borneo Campaign, and Morotai remained an important logistical hub and command center until the Dutch reestablished their colonial rule in the NEI.|$|E
5|$|The Memphis {{relocation}} {{effort was}} led by AutoZone founder Pitt Hyde, who promised to purchase 50% of the team. The city had a 1991 venue, Pyramid Arena, {{which could be used}} as a temporary home until a new US$250 million venue was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in 2004. The venue would be publicly financed through sales tax rebates, government-backed bonds and hotel and car rental taxes. The Memphis efforts to get an NBA team had started in 1997, following the relocation of the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League to Nashville.|$|E

5|$|Two more Fat Man {{assemblies}} were readied, {{and scheduled}} to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on August 11 and 14, and Tibbets was ordered by LeMay {{to return to}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, to collect them. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until August 16. Therefore, {{it could have been}} <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> on August 19. Unable to reach Marshall, Groves ordered on his own authority on August 13 that the core should not be shipped.|$|E
5|$|On August7, five Hurricane Hunter {{planes were}} {{dispatched}} to Hickam Air Force Base to fly missions into the storm. Later that day, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued tropical storm watches {{for the island}} of Hawaii, Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, and Molokai. On August9, the watch was expanded to include Oahu. The watches for the Big Island were later cancelled as the forecast track appeared to drift further north toward Maui County and Oahu. The Red Cross opened shelters throughout the islands on August10. Twelve were on the Big Island, seven were on Maui, two on Molokai and one on Lanai. The Honolulu International Airport ensured that eight generators were <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in case Felicia caused a power outage at the airport. All tropical storm watches were cancelled at 11 a.m. August 11 as Felicia dissipated to a remnant low.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} was designed, as was its predecessor at Watten, to receive, process and launch V-2 rockets {{at a high}} rate. Trains carrying V-2s would enter {{the heart of the}} complex through the Ida rail tunnel, where they would be unloaded. A large number of V-2s could be stored in the side tunnels; LOX would also be produced on-site <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use.</b> When the time came, the rockets would be moved into the octagonal preparation chamber where they would be lifted to a vertical position for fuelling and arming. From there they would be transported on motorised launch carriages, still in a vertical position, through the Gustav and Gretchen passageways. The launch pads were located {{at the end of the}} track on the floor of the quarry, from where the missiles would be fired.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of “Are Islamic boarding schools <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>using</b> the computer-based {{test in the}} national exam policy? is interesting and challenging. Looking at the various conditions of Islamic boarding schools throughout Indonesia, {{the use of the}} computer-based test in the national exam policy for English subject is challenging for santris and ustazd (teachers). It is challenging because Islamic boarding schools are characteristically underprivileged and santris live in disadvantaged conditions under firm rules. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss the use of the computer based test in the national examination for English subject at Islamic boarding schools. In this paper, I will discuss about the characteristics of English examination, the national examination policy in Indonesia, the national examination with computer based test, and the national examination in Islamic boarding school, and whether Islamic boarding schools are <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>using</b> the computer-based test in the national exam policy for English subject...|$|R

5|$|The {{first two}} of the roundabouts to reach {{operational}} status were those at Point Pleasant Road and Durand Boulevard. The Point Pleasant Road roundabout opened to traffic on September8, 2009, by which time the Durand Boulevard roundabout was also <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use.</b> The Titus Avenue roundabout was completed in late 2009, while work on the Seneca Road junction was delayed until October 2009 due to {{the proximity of the}} intersection {{to the side of the}} hill overlooking Irondequoit Bay. Although the original plans for the project had already accounted for the issue, the plans had to be revised to comply with new federal standards regarding the use of steel pilings for supporting the hillside. Work on the roundabout finally began on October12. The Seneca Road roundabout and the new alignment of Sea Breeze Drive north of Durand Boulevard were completed in the first half of 2010.|$|E
5|$|The onion {{plant has}} {{a fan of}} hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb {{at the base of}} the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are {{composed}} of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs.|$|E
5|$|While the United States had {{developed}} {{plans for an}} air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War, the capture of Allied bases in the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long-ranged Boeing B-29 Superfortress became <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in combat. Operation Matterhorn involved India-based B-29s staging through bases around Chengdu in China to make a series of raids on strategic targets in Japan. This effort failed to achieve the strategic objectives that its planners had intended, largely because of logistical problems, the bomber's mechanical difficulties, the vulnerability of Chinese staging bases, and the extreme range required to reach key Japanese cities.|$|E

5|$|Work {{on the new}} Beta process {{building}} commenced on 20 October 1943. Equipment installation {{began on}} 1 April 1944, and it was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> on 10 September 1944. A third Beta process building, 9204-3, was authorized in May 1944 to process {{the output of the}} K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. It was completed on 15 May 1945. A fourth Beta process building, 9204-4, was authorized on 2 April 1945 and was completed by 1 December 1945. A new group of Alpha chemistry buildings known as the 9207 group was commenced in June 1944, but work was halted in June 1945 before they were completed. Along with these main buildings, there were offices, workshops, warehouses and other structures. There were two steam plants for heating, and a power plant for electricity.|$|E
5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive Pumpkin bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One serious incident occurred when a Pumpkin bomb was released in the bomb bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was taxiing. The bomb fell through the closed bomb bay doors onto the taxiway. The plane came to a halt in a shower of sparks, but fire fighters doused the plane and the bomb in foam, and the bomb did not explode. The aircraft had to be jacked up to remove the bomb.|$|E
5|$|As the Mk. IVA was {{modified}} into its improved Mk. V, the Mk. VI followed suit. But by early 1941 {{it was decided}} to make the Mk. VI an entirely new design, to more easily fit in small aircraft. EMI had already been awarded a contract for a dozen prototype units in October 1940 for delivery in February, but these continued changes made this impossible. Nevertheless, they presented a production contract for 1,500 units in December. Between December and March, production examples began arriving and displayed an enormous number of problems, which the engineers worked through one-by one. By July the systems were <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>use,</b> and began being installed in the new Defiant Mk. II early in August, but these demonstrated a problem where the system would lock-on to transmissions from other AI aircraft in the area, which resulted in further modifications. It was not until the beginning of December 1941 that these issues were fully solved and the units were cleared for squadron use.|$|E
