40|$|Human altruistic <b>responding</b> (called give <b>responding),</b> which {{delivered}} a reinforcer to {{someone other than}} the responder, was compared to <b>responding</b> where the responder was {{the recipient of the}} reinforcer (called earn <b>responding).</b> The same type of response (button pressing), the same reinforcer (a point representing a penny), and the same reinforcer contingency (a 40 -response fixed-ratio schedule) were used for both give and earn <b>responding.</b> Since points representing pennies were used to reinforce give and earn <b>responding,</b> <b>responding</b> for points not worth money was also assessed. Give, earn, and point <b>responding</b> were arranged as concurrent incompatible operants. Lowest rates were obtained for point <b>responding.</b> Compared to earn <b>responding,</b> give <b>responding</b> occurred at lower rates, was more susceptible to cessation when point <b>responding</b> was possible, extinguished more rapidly in the absence of money, and produced less <b>responding</b> during reconditioning compared to conditioning when reconditioning followed a period of nonreinforcement.

40|$|Signalled response-independent shocks were {{superimposed}} on rats' wheel-turn <b>responding</b> to avoid shock administered {{to their feet}} through a grid floor or to their tails through fixed electrodes. In Experiment I, a tone paired with response-independent foot shock increased <b>responding</b> in three of four rats; a tone paired with tail shock increased <b>responding</b> in only one of four rats and suppressed <b>responding</b> in two rats. In Experiment II, a tone presented randomly with respect to response-independent shock had no reliable effect on <b>responding</b> to avoid foot shock or tail shock. In Experiment III, tail shock and foot shock were compared in a within-subject design while the temporal pattern of <b>responding</b> during conditioned stimuli was recorded. <b>Responding</b> during the conditioned stimulus preceding foot shock was characterized by initial suppression of <b>responding</b> at tone onset, followed by increased <b>responding</b> just before response-independent shock. <b>Responding</b> was suppressed throughout the conditioned stimulus preceding tail shock.

40|$|Similar {{rates of}} punished and nonpunished <b>responding,</b> {{maintained}} with equated rates of reinforcement, {{were established in}} pairs of rats. One subject of each pair was exposed to a random-ratio schedule of food presentation. The interreinforcement intervals for this subject comprised the intervals of a random-interval schedule of reinforcement for the other (yoked) rat. The random-ratio schedule maintained rates of <b>responding</b> higher than those maintained by the same rate of reinforcement schedule according to the yoked random-interval contingency. A random-ratio schedule of electric foot shock added to the random-ratio schedule of food presentation suppressed rates of <b>responding</b> such that similar rates of <b>responding</b> were observed in rats of both groups. Pentobarbital (3. 0 to 17. 0 mg/kg) increased punished <b>responding</b> at doses that {{had little effect on}} or decreased nonpunished <b>responding,</b> whereas cocaine (5. 6 to 30 mg/kg) increased nonpunished <b>responding</b> at doses that decreased or did not alter punished <b>responding.</b> Qualitatively different effects of pharmacological agents on punished and nonpunished <b>responding</b> can be obtained using procedures that generate similar rates and temporal patterns of punished and nonpunished <b>responding.</b> The effects of pentobarbital and cocaine on <b>responding</b> can be determined by factors other than simply the baseline rate of <b>responding...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} drugs were studied in pigeons whose {{responses}} were punished with electric shock during {{one component of}} a multiple fixed-interval 5 -min fixed-interval 5 -min schedule of food presentation. Most of the drugs analyzed for rate-dependent effects increased low rates of both punished and unpunished <b>responding,</b> while increasing higher rates less, or decreasing them; however, low rates of punished <b>responding</b> sometimes were increased more by pentobarbital, diazepam, and chlordiazepoxide than were matched rates of unpunished <b>responding.</b> In contrast, d-amphetamine and chlorpromazine usually increased low rates of unpunished <b>responding</b> more than matched rates of punished <b>responding.</b> These two drugs also decreased high rates of unpunished <b>responding</b> less than they decreased high rates of punished <b>responding.</b> Thus, the effects of drugs on punished <b>responding</b> depend on the control rate of punished responding; however, the rate-dependent effects of drugs on punished <b>responding</b> are not always {{the same as they}} are for unpunished <b>responding...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rates and {{patterns}} of key-press <b>responding</b> maintained under schedules in which <b>responding</b> resulted in intravenous injections of cocaine were studied in squirrel monkeys and rhesus monkeys. Each injection {{was followed by a}} 60 - or 100 -sec timeout period. Schedule-controlled behavior was obtained at appropriate cocaine doses in each species. Under FR 10 or FR 30 schedules, performance was characterized by high rates of <b>responding</b> (usually more than one response per second) in each ratio. Under FI 5 -min schedules, performance was characterized by an initial pause, followed by acceleration of <b>responding</b> to a final rate that was maintained {{until the end of the}} interval. Under multiple fixed-ratio fixed-interval schedules, rates {{and patterns}} of <b>responding</b> appropriate to each schedule component were maintained. <b>Responding</b> seldom occurred during timeout periods under any schedule studied. At doses of cocaine above or below those that maintained characteristic schedule-controlled behavior, rates of <b>responding</b> were relatively low {{and patterns of}} <b>responding</b> were irregular. Characteristic fixed-interval <b>responding</b> was maintained over a wider range of cocaine doses than characteristic fixed-ratio <b>responding.</b> Complex patterns of <b>responding</b> controlled by discriminative stimuli under fixed-ratio or fixed-interval schedules can be maintained by cocaine injections in squirrel monkeys and rhesus monkeys...|$|R

5|$|After DNA damage, {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are activated. Checkpoint {{activation}} pauses the cell cycle {{and gives the}} cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries. An intra-S checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM <b>responds</b> to DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily <b>responds</b> to stalled replication forks. These kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1 has also been identified. These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins.|$|E

40|$|<b>Responding</b> {{maintained}} in squirrel monkeys under 5 -min fixes-interval schedules of either food presentation or termination of a visual stimulus associated with electric-shock delivery was suppressed by presenting an electric shock for every thirtieth response (punishment). In monkeys <b>responding</b> under the schedule of food presentation, d-amphetamine sulfate only further decreased punished <b>responding,</b> and pentobarbital sodium markedly increased punished <b>responding,</b> as expected from previous reports. In monkeys <b>responding</b> under the schedule of stimulus-shock termination, however, {{the effects of}} the two drugs were opposite: d-amphetamine markedly increased punished <b>responding,</b> whereas pentobarbital only decreased <b>responding.</b> Thus, {{the effects of the}}se drugs on punished <b>responding</b> were different {{depending on the type of}} event maintaining <b>responding.</b> These and previous results indicate that it may be misleading and inaccurate to speak of the effects of drugs on "punished responding" as though punishment were a unitary phenomenon. As with any behavior, the effects of drugs and other interventions on punished <b>responding</b> cannot be accurately characterized independently of the precise conditions under which the behavior occurs...|$|R

40|$|Local {{patterns}} of <b>responding</b> were studied when pigeons pecked for food in concurrent variable-interval schedules (Experiment I) and in multiple variable-interval schedules (Experiment II). In Experiment I, {{similarities in the}} distribution of interresponse times on the two keys provided further evidence that <b>responding</b> on concurrent schedules is determined more by allocation of time than by changes in local pattern of <b>responding.</b> Relative <b>responding</b> in local intervals since a preceding reinforcement showed consistent deviations from matching between relative <b>responding</b> and relative reinforcement in various postreinforcement intervals. Response rates in local intervals since a preceding changeover showed that rate of <b>responding</b> is not the same on both keys in all postchangeover intervals. The relative amount of time consumed by interchangeover times of a given duration approximately matched relative frequency of reinforced interchangeover times of that duration. However, computer simulation showed that this matching was probably a necessary artifact of concurrent schedules. In Experiment II, when component durations were 180 sec, the relationship between distribution of interresponse times and rate of reinforcement in the component showed that <b>responding</b> was determined by local pattern of <b>responding</b> in the components. Since <b>responding</b> on concurrent schedules appears to be determined by time allocation, this result would establish a behavioral difference between multiple and concurrent schedules. However, when component durations were 5 sec, local pattern of <b>responding</b> in a component (defined by interresponse times) was less important in determining <b>responding</b> than was amount of time spent <b>responding</b> in a component (defined by latencies). In fact, with 5 -sec component durations, the relative amount of time spent <b>responding</b> in a component approximately matched relative frequency of reinforcement in the component. Thus, as component durations in multiple schedules decrease, multiple schedules become more like concurrent schedules, in the sense that <b>responding</b> is affected by allocation of time rather than by local pattern of <b>responding...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pigeons <b>responded</b> under a {{multiple}} fixedinterval 5 -min, 30 -response fixed-ratio schedule of food reinforcement. Acute pargyline doses between 10. 0 and 50. 0 mg/kg (i. m.), given {{immediately prior to}} the session, decreased <b>responding.</b> Daily administration of 50 mg/kg pargyline (24 mg/kg, every 12 h) initially decreased <b>responding.</b> Tolerance developed so that after 4 days of daily pargyline, <b>responding</b> had returned to control values. Chronic pargyline resulted in an enhanced sensitivity {{to the effects of}} d -amphetamine, ephedrine, tyramine, and morphine on schedule-controlled <b>responding.</b> Both d -amphetamine and pentobarbital increased fixed-interval <b>responding</b> at relatively low doses, while higher doses decreased <b>responding.</b> Daily pargyline resulted in an increased sensitivity to both the increases and decreases in response rates produced by d -amphetamine. In contrast, sensitivity to pentobarbital was not changed after daily pargyline.
