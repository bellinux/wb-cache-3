5|$|After the two-car draft style {{dominated}} the 2011Budweiser Shootout, NASCAR reduced the front grille opening to 50square inches and the overflow valve for the cooling {{system would be}} supplied by NASCAR and set at 33pounds per square inch. Also, high speeds in the race caused NASCAR {{to reduce the size}} of the <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> by 1/64-inch, with the expectations of cutting 10horsepower from the engines.|$|E
5|$|Practice {{and first}} round {{qualifying}} {{was held on}} Thursday, October 15, 1998; Bobby Labonte led pre-qualifying practice with a lap time of 46.722 seconds. Five Ford teams, those of drivers Chad Little, Jimmy Spencer, Rich Bickle, Dick Trickle and Billy Standridge, ran Thunderbird-bodied race cars, instead of the standard Taurus ran at most 1998 Winston Cup Series races, believing the Thunderbird to have an aerodynamic advantage at the <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> racetracks. Randal Ritter's car failed to pass inspection due to extreme irregularities in its construction, and the team withdrew before practice began.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 Pepsi 400 was a NASCAR Winston Cup Series {{stock car}} race held on October 17, 1998, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Originally {{scheduled}} to be held on the Fourth of July, the race was postponed until the fall due to widespread wildfires in central Florida; {{it was the first}} superspeedway race to be held at night, and the first time (and, as of 2017, the only time) there were two consecutive points-paying <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> races, with the Winston 500 being run first on October 11.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} three reasons that NASCAR used <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|NASCAR's {{concerns}} with speeds because of power-to-weight ratios result in <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> at other tracks. The Goody's Dash Series (known {{now as the}} ISCARS series with its new ownership) used <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> at Bristol during at least {{the last years of}} the series' existence when the cars were using six-cylinder engines (compared to the traditional four cylinder engines), in addition to their Daytona races.|$|R
50|$|<b>Restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> had the {{openings}} reduced from 29/32 inches to 57/64 inches {{to counter the}} horsepower increase.|$|R
5|$|She later {{made her}} {{debut in the}} Winston Cup Series in the No. 84 Michael Kranefuss Racing Ford Taurus, and planned to run six races. The events were chosen because they were at tracks where Robinson felt comfortable, located in large markets where they would receive more attention. Her {{schedule}} was devised to allow Robinson time to test. She planned to race at Talladega Superspeedway but decided against {{it because of the}} rules regarding <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> racing. Robinson failed to qualify for the first race she attempted (at California Speedway) when her car's rear-end gearing became detached causing her to collide with the wall. Four races later, she started from 32nd at Michigan International Speedway, and became the first woman to start a NASCAR Cup Series race since Patty Moise in 1989. Robinson finished 34th after spinning her car in the track's second turn but avoided damage. After she failed to qualify for her next two races, she was unable to complete her schedule due to sponsorship issues. Robinson stated that she used the season as motivation; she hoped to be driving consistently in five years, and wanted to be a spokesperson for women.|$|E
25|$|Gordon {{holds the}} {{records for the}} most Cup Series {{victories}} on <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> tracks (12) and road courses (9), {{as well as a}} record six-consecutive road-course wins.|$|E
25|$|In {{his final}} <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> race at Talladega, Earnhardt would {{start on the}} pole and he would miss 3 big wrecks in the closing laps to finish 7th.|$|E
50|$|Since the 2012 season, NASCAR Sprint Cup cars {{now have}} fuel {{injection}} instead of carburetors, but <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> {{are still being}} used.|$|R
5000|$|... 1970: <b>Restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> {{made their}} racing {{debut in the}} 1970 Yankee 400 and Charlie Glotzbach drove a Dodge Daytona to the win.|$|R
50|$|For {{the events}} of Speedweeks, {{the size of the}} holes in the <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> was reduced from 29/32nd of an inch to 57/64th of an inch.|$|R
25|$|Travis Kvapil {{and various}} drivers join Go FAS Racing, a team {{consisting}} of Go Green Racing and Frank Stoddard's FAS Lane Racing, for races {{that are not}} road courses (Boris Said) or <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> superspeedways (Terry Labonte).|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Labonte {{would run}} five races for FAS Lane Racing, posting a best finish of nineteenth. In {{addition}} to running all four <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> races, he ran at Bristol Motor Speedway in March, finishing twenty-fifth.|$|E
25|$|In the Fall, Earnhardt {{took his}} second <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> win as {{he won the}} EA Sports 500 at Talladega as a crash {{unfolded}} on the back straightaway that caused Bobby Labonte to flip over and also collected 15 other cars. The Talladega victory earned Earnhardt a Winston No Bull 5 $1 million bonus. He was docked 25 points, however, after his car failed post-race inspection. With this win, DEI swept {{three of the four}} <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> races for 2001, only failing to win the spring Talladega race. He finished the 2001 season eighth in the points standings with three wins, nine Top 5's, and fifteen Top 10's, as well as two poles.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} NASCAR Cup Series race held since the deaths of Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin Jr. at this track. NASCAR used <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> for this race as a result, {{in an effort to}} slow the top speed of the cars. However, {{cautions}} were so frequent and passing was so slowed that outside polesitter Jeff Burton led all 300 laps. This is the only race to date on a short track that had used <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates.</b> They were not used again after this race.|$|R
50|$|The 2011 Sprint Cup {{season was}} the last {{complete}} Cup season with carbureted engines. NASCAR {{announced that it would}} change to fuel injection for the 2012 season. The injection system used by NASCAR is a different system from that used in IndyCar Racing and other motorsports series and <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> are usable with the NASCAR system; they were used for January 2012 testing at Daytona. The current <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> are bolted beneath a throttle body that sits in the same place as the former carburetors.|$|R
50|$|There were 41 American-born drivers on the {{starting}} grid. More {{than one hundred}} thousand people would go and see Davey Allison defeat Terry Labonte by {{more than three-quarters of}} a second. Average speed of the race was 154.228 mph lasting three hours and four minutes, excluding the red flag period. Carburetor <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> - now fuel injection <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> - became de rigueur at Talladega and Daytona races after this event; enforcing a status quo of vehicles not going as fast as their engines desire to the present day.|$|R
25|$|With the No. 56 shut down, Michael Waltrip {{entered a}} {{partnership}} with the 2013 No. 87 NEMCO Motorsports team, to the new formed Identity Ventures Racing in the No. 66 with Michael Waltrip running the <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> races and Joe Nemechek and various drivers running the remainder of the races.|$|E
25|$|Engine and {{transmission}} changes are prohibited during a race weekend. Xfinity and Truck Series engines must last two race weekends, excluding <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> races. Changing either {{will result in}} starting {{in the rear of}} the field. Transmission changes are allowed during road course weekends and during the race weekends at Pocono Raceway. In addition, during Speedweeks at Daytona teams are allowed one free engine change between the qualifying races and final practice session.|$|E
25|$|Ambrose {{returned}} to Richard Petty Motorsports for 2012. In February he almost won the Budweiser Shootout with bump-drafting help from Keselowski; but lost the lead {{just as he}} took the white flag to Tony Stewart and eventual race winner Kyle Busch. Ambrose said after the race that despite losing the Shootout the race was his best performance on a <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> track (although he also had several top-tens at previous plate races, such as a 4th-place finish at Talladega in the spring 2009 race).|$|E
50|$|Bill Elliott's pole {{speed of}} 199.388 mph (48.027 seconds) {{is the fastest}} {{qualifying}} lap turned in the Winston Cup Series since <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> began to be used at Daytona and Talladega.|$|R
50|$|May 10, 1997: Mark Martin won the Winston Select 500, a race {{which had}} no caution flags, at a NASCAR 500-mile record speed of 188.354 mph, nearly {{ten years after the}} {{introduction}} of <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1988: <b>Restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> were {{mandated}} to reduce dangerously high speeds at Daytona. Bobby Allison {{and his son}} Davey finished one-two and celebrated together in Victory Lane, making Bobby Allison the oldest driver to win the Daytona 500.|$|R
25|$|What {{is now the}} No. 33 car {{started as}} the No. 90 car in 2003. RCR entered the No. 90 Chevrolet in the fall Talladega race with John Andretti driving. The car was {{sponsored}} by AOL 9.0 and was numbered 90 for marketing purposes. Ron Hornaday, Jr. ran the No. 90 in the season-ending Ford 400 with Childress Vineyards on the hood. In 2004, {{it was announced that}} Kerry Earnhardt would drive the car (renumbered to 33) in five NASCAR Nextel Cup races. Mike Skinner would run the car in the Daytona 500, finishing 22nd. Earnhardt drove the car in the other three <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> races with Bass Pro Shops sponsoring, getting his best finish of 24th. He attempted all of the <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> races again in 2005, finishing 17th at Talladega. In addition, road course ringer Brian Simo brought home a 10th-place finish at Infineon Raceway. Clint Bowyer (Childress' Busch Series driver) made his Nextel Cup debut in this car with a Sylvania sponsorship at Phoenix in April 2005. Scott Wimmer ran the season finale in 2005, attempted two races in 2006 (making one start), and only made one start out of seven attempts in 2007. On May 2, 2008, Wimmer attempted but failed to qualify for the 2008 Crown Royal presents the Dan Lowry 400 at Richmond. Wimmer had sponsorships from Holiday Inn and Camping World/RVs.com. Ken Schrader and Mike Wallace ran one race apice in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1999 season, fans began {{discussing}} Earnhardt's age and speculating {{that with}} his son, Dale Jr., making his Winston Cup debut, Earnhardt might be contemplating retirement. Earnhardt swept both races for the year at Talladega, leading some to conclude that his talent had become limited to the <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> tracks, which require a unique skill set and an exceptionally powerful racecar to win. But halfway through the year, Earnhardt began to show {{some of the old}} spark. In the August race at Michigan, he led laps late in the race and nearly pulled off his first win on a non-restrictor-plate track since 1996.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Harvick {{started the}} Nationwide Series season {{by winning the}} Orbitz 300 at Daytona, {{claiming}} his first win in a <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> race, {{as well as the}} first win for new sponsor AutoZone in NASCAR's Nationwide Series. He also won at New Hampshire International Speedway, winning the Camping World 200 presented by RVs.com. He also ended up unexpectedly winning the inaugural race at Montreal in August, the NAPA Auto Parts 200, after with two laps to go, leader Robby Gordon was black-flagged for intentionally causing a crash involving rookie Marcos Ambrose. The win was considered a bit of an upset as many expected the road course ringers to dominate and Harvick had started 43rd in the race due to a driver change.|$|E
50|$|In the {{transitional}} years (1971-74) where the seven-litre engines (427ci) had <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates,</b> Daytona and Talladega broke 40 official lead changes six times, while Michigan International Speedway broke 35 official lead changes {{in both of}} its 1971 races.|$|R
50|$|Allison won {{the first}} Daytona 500 run with <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> in February 1988 by a car length over his son Davey Allison, {{rendering}} him the first driver to have won the Daytona 500 both with and without <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates.</b> He is the oldest driver (50 years) ever to win the Daytona 500. Bobby and Davey Allison are the first one-two father/son finish in the Daytona 500. As a result of permanent injuries in a crash at Pocono (see below), Bobby now has no memory of the final win of his career or of celebrating together with his son in victory lane. He {{was elected to the}} NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2011.|$|R
50|$|April 30, 1987: Bill Elliott set {{the all-time}} NASCAR {{qualifying}} record, winning the pole for the Winston 500 {{at a speed}} of 212.809 mph(44.998 seconds). The record still stands due {{to the use of}} the carburetor <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates,</b> mandated after the 1987 season.|$|R
25|$|According to Esquire Magazine, {{a pint of}} Guinness {{should be}} served in a {{slightly}} tulip shaped pint glass (as opposed to the taller European tulip glass or 'Nonic' glass, which contains a ridge approx 3/4 {{of the way up}} the glass). To begin the pour, the server holds the glass at a 45° angle below the tap and fills the glass 3/4 full. On {{the way out of the}} tap, the beer is forced at high speed through a five-hole disc <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> in the end of the tap, creating friction and forcing the creation of small nitrogen bubbles which form a creamy head. After allowing the initial pour to settle, the server fills the remainder of the glass until the head forms a slight dome over the top of the glass.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Daytona for the Coke Zero 400, Johnson led 94 laps {{and held}} off Tony Stewart and Kevin Harvick on a green-white-checker finish {{to win his}} fourth race of the year. In winning the race, Johnson became the first driver since Bobby Allison in 1982 to sweep both Daytona races in a season. This was a {{significant}} improvement in Johnson's runs on the <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> tracks, {{as he had been}} crashed out of the running at both Daytona races in 2012, had an engine failure early while leading at Talladega in the spring and was part of a crash on the last lap in the fall. Also, he was one of only three drivers to sweep the top ten, the other two drivers being Ryan Newman and Dale Earnhardt, Jr.|$|E
500|$|After the two-car style draft (also called tandem racing) {{dominated}} races held on <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> tracks during 2011, NASCAR {{reduced the}} size of the radiators from five liters to two liters and the air intakes were moved towards the car's fascia section. The size of the <b>restrictor</b> <b>plate</b> was reduced by [...] and the cars were required to run with softer springs and a smaller rear spoiler. These changes were intended to reduce the effectiveness of two-car style drafting and to make the cars more challenging to turn. Sprint Cup Series director John Darby stated NASCAR {{wanted to be able to}} allow teams more options with drafting and hoped the difference in speeds between tandem drafting and pack style racing would be reduced.|$|E
5000|$|Unrestricted {{high-speed}} {{races at}} Talladega Superspeedway ended after the 1987 Winston 500 {{because of the}} lap 22 crash. While the summer race (Talladega 500) would be run with a smaller carburetor, <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> would end up being compulsory {{by the end of}} the year.|$|R
50|$|This {{race was}} held on July 5 of that year at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, and was the third race {{utilizing}} <b>restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> this season. TNT's air time began at 6:30 PM US EDT, and MRN with Sirius Satellite Radio carried the radio broadcast beginning at 7:15 PM US EDT.|$|R
5000|$|... 1988: <b>Restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> were {{mandated}} to reduce dangerously high speeds at Daytona and its sister track, Talladega Speedway. The race began despite uncertainty {{about how well}} these would work. Eventually, Bobby Allison and his son Davey Allison finished one-two and celebrated together in Victory Lane. Bobby Allison thus became the oldest driver to win the Daytona 500. The race is also remembered for Richard Petty's wild accident on lap 106. Petty spun, became airborne and tumbled along a large section of catch fence before his car came to a stop. The car was then torn nearly in half from hits by A. J. Foyt and Brett Bodine. Petty escaped without serious injury. <b>Restrictor</b> <b>plates</b> remain in use at Daytona and Talladega to this day despite a disposition to create pack racing and a phenomenon known as The Big One.|$|R
