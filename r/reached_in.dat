Persons who were able bodied could reach further than those with SCI [33, 34, 37, 38]. No distinction was found <b>in</b> forward <b>reaching</b> distance between persons with different levels of SCI {{as determined by the}} ASIA score (high thoracic T 2 -T 8, low thoracic T 9 -T 12 and lumbar L 1 -L 5) [33, 34, 37]. Only one study reported further displacement of the centre of pressure (CoP) in persons with low thoracic SCI (T 9 - 12) compared to persons with high thoracic SCI (T 2 - 8) [38]. <b>In</b> multidirectional <b>reach,</b> differences <b>in</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>in</b> all directions summed in a single measure were found, with better <b>reach</b> <b>in</b> able bodied persons than in persons with SCI [32]. If a single measure for each direction was given, there was better <b>reaching</b> <b>in</b> almost all single directions in able-bodied persons compared to persons with SCI [31, 32]. Also, there was better <b>reach</b> <b>in</b> persons low thoracic SCI than in persons with high SCI [30]. Similarly, persons with SCI with voluntary trunk muscle contractions could reach further than persons with SCI without trunk muscle contractions [32]. No difference was found in single direction measures between subgroups of persons with SCI for <b>reaching</b> <b>in</b> the lateral directions to both sides [29, 31], to the left side [32] and for oblique directions to the left side [29, 32].|$|R

In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was having a hard time finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was <b>reached</b> <b>in</b> June 1917.|$|E

Stanford Hotels Corporation, a privately owned firm, successfully bid $48 million for the structure. After a definitive sale agreement was <b>reached</b> <b>in</b> 1998, Sarakreek backed out of the deal. Hotels Stanford sued in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. In Stanford Hotels Corporation v. Potomac Creek Associates (CAB-1413-99, 1999), Superior Court Judge Leonard Braman ruled that Sarakreek was not in breach of contract. Stanford Hotels appealed. Various motions delayed the appellate hearing until 2009.|$|E
5|$|As the Merlin was {{considered}} to be so important to the war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 Merlin order. Agreement was <b>reached</b> <b>in</b> September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E
