50|$|To {{achieve a}} better {{pressure}} resistance, hoses can be reinforced with fibers or a steel cord. Commonly used reinforcement methods are braiding, spiraling, knitting and wrapping of fabric plies. The reinforcement increases the pressure resistance {{but also the}} stiffness. To obtain flexibility, corrugations <b>or</b> <b>bellows</b> are used. Usually, circumferential <b>or</b> helical reinforcement <b>rings</b> are applied to maintain these corrugated <b>or</b> <b>bellowed</b> structures under internal pressure.|$|R

5000|$|Force {{collector}} typesThese {{types of}} electronic pressure sensors generally use a force collector (such a diaphragm, piston, bourdon tube, <b>or</b> <b>bellows)</b> to measure strain (or deflection) due to applied force over an area (pressure).|$|R
50|$|Imagons do not {{typically}} have shutter mechanisms and are instead mounted on shutters (i.e., Copal large format shutters). There are also variants {{which can be}} mounted on focusing helicoids <b>or</b> <b>bellows</b> {{to be used with}} medium and 35mm cameras.|$|R
50|$|A sylphon, <b>or</b> <b>bellows,</b> is used, {{among other}} purposes, to {{transfer}} motion {{through the wall}} of a vacuum chamber. It {{can be used as a}} squeeze piston for simple pumps. It can also be used as a flexible coupling to transfer rotary motion between shafts.|$|R

25|$|In 1689, Denis Papin had {{suggested}} that the pressure and fresh air inside a diving bell could be maintained by a force pump <b>or</b> <b>bellows.</b> His idea was implemented exactly 100 years later by the engineer John Smeaton who built the first workable diving air pump in 1789.|$|R
50|$|Richard Bellewe <b>or</b> <b>Bellew</b> (fl. 1575 - 1585) was a legal {{reporter}} of Irish ancestry and {{a member}} of Lincoln's Inn.

50|$|However, modern {{vibration}} {{analysis methods}} {{can account for}} the pogo oscillation {{to ensure that it}} is far away from the vehicle's resonant frequencies. Suppression methods include damping mechanisms <b>or</b> <b>bellows</b> in propellant lines. The Space Shuttle main engines each have a damper in the LOX line, but not in the hydrogen fuel line.|$|R
50|$|During operation, fuel {{is placed}} in or on the hearth and ignited. A source of moving air, such as a fan <b>or</b> <b>bellows,</b> {{introduces}} additional air into the fire through the tuyere. With additional air, the fire consumes more fuel and burns hotter (and cleaner - smoke {{can be thought of}} as escaped potential fuel.|$|R
6000|$|He {{seemed to}} brace {{himself up and}} lean {{backward}} against the air {{as he stared at}} me. “How about this here tide that’s rushin’ out through the Golden Gate?” he demanded, <b>or</b> <b>bellowed,</b> rather. “How fast is she ebbin’?

60|$|Evidently {{these were}} not the foes he looked for, but a subtler, a more indomitable.

50|$|Foggers {{fulfill a}} similar role to mist {{sprayers}} in producing particles of very small size, but {{use a different}} method. Whereas mist sprayers create a high-speed stream of air which can travel significant distances, foggers use a piston <b>or</b> <b>bellows</b> to create a stagnant area of pesticide that is often used for enclosed areas, such as houses and animal shelters.|$|R
50|$|The {{changes would}} have {{lengthened}} the runs, running from Burlington to <b>Bellows</b> Falls <b>or</b> Ogdensburg on one day, staying over and then running {{back the next}} day. Under current operating orders they would make the run from Rutland to Burlington <b>or</b> <b>Bellows</b> Falls and back in a day, or from Malone, New York running out and back to Ogdensburg and Burlington.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} to the top loading design is the reliance on gravity to contain the water, rather than potentially trouble-prone or short-lived front door seals. Top loaders may require less periodic maintenance, {{since there is no}} need to clean a door seal <b>or</b> <b>bellows,</b> although a plastic tub may still require a periodic [...] "maintenance wash" [...] cycle (described below).|$|R
25|$|Bird ringing is {{the term}} used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the USA and Australia. Organised ringing efforts are called <b>ringing</b> <b>or</b> banding schemes, and the organisations that run them are <b>ringing</b> <b>or</b> banding authorities. (Birds are ringed rather than rung) Those who <b>ring</b> <b>or</b> band birds are known as ringers or banders, and they are {{typically}} active at <b>ringing</b> <b>or</b> banding stations.|$|R
5000|$|Strictly speaking, {{macrophotography}} is technical photography {{with actual}} image size ranging from near life-size (1:1 image-to-object ratio) to about ten or twenty times life-size (10 or 20:1 ratio, at which photomicrography begins). [...] "Macro" [...] lenses were originally regular formula lenses optimized for close object distances, {{mounted on a}} long extension tube <b>or</b> <b>bellows</b> accessory to provide the necessary close focusing, but preventing focusing on distant objects.|$|R

50|$|As {{weight and}} power and length increased, there were {{experiments}} with flexible boiler casings; from 1910 the Santa Fe road introduced 2-6-6-2 locomotives weighing 392,000 lb, with a 37 ft long boiler barrel, with a firetube reheater and a firetube feedwater section in front, each separated by a blank section, and variants of a telescopic <b>or</b> <b>bellows</b> type boiler casing. These were unsuccessful, and later engines used conventional boilers.|$|R
50|$|A fairy ring, {{also known}} as fairy circle, elf circle, elf <b>ring</b> <b>or</b> pixie <b>ring,</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring <b>ring</b> <b>or</b> arc of mushrooms. The rings may grow to over 10 m in diameter, and they become stable over time as the fungus grows and seeks food underground. They are found mainly in forested areas, but also appear in grasslands <b>or</b> rangelands. Fairy <b>rings</b> are detectable by sporocarps in <b>rings</b> <b>or</b> arcs, {{as well as by}} a necrotic zone (dead grass), <b>or</b> a <b>ring</b> of dark green grass. Fungus mycelium is present in the <b>ring</b> <b>or</b> arc underneath.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{of their}} large, {{powerful}} bodies and impressive horns, takins have few natural enemies other than bears or wolves. They are generally slow moving but can react quickly if angered or frightened. When needed, a takin can leap nimbly from rock to rock. If a takin senses danger, it warns the others {{with a loud}} [...] "cough" [...] that sends the herd running for cover. Takins can also make an intimidating roar <b>or</b> <b>bellow.</b>|$|R
50|$|In many respects, Namerimburrudû incantations share {{characteristics}} {{with both}} the Šurpu series and Lipšur litanies. The incantations endeavor {{to determine whether the}} subject has intentionally or otherwise sworn falsely and brought upon himself the wrath of his personal god. However, in contrast, the invocation of inanimate objects, such as various boats, road travel, sunrise and sunset, entry and exit of city gates, the street, oven <b>or</b> <b>bellows,</b> may merely be related to their misuse in the delivery of oaths.|$|R
5000|$|Females {{appear to}} be more {{tolerant}} of females than males are of males, leading to greater overlap in female home ranges. Males are {{more likely to engage in}} agonistic behaviors, such as slowly circling each other, chasing, or actual fighting. Circling anteaters may cry a drawn-out [...] "harrr". In combat, they slash at each other with their claws and wrestle each other to the ground. Fighting anteaters may emit roars <b>or</b> <b>bellows.</b> Males are possibly territorial.|$|R

Either {{it does not}} work properly, it's stolen, removed for repairs (and replaced with alternative elevation methods like a cannon <b>or</b> a <b>bellow),</b> <b>or</b> replaced by newer versions commissioned to a mixed list of builders (like a maker of chess pieces or a glassworker).|$|R
