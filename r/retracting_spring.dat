Another actuator which is designed {{in the shape of}} <b>retracting</b> <b>spring</b> has two spring ends, where one end in an area of an end section of a support unit and other end in an area of the servo unit are connected. USE - Used for remote locking of fuel tank cap within an area of a motor vehicle, and as control unit for releasing arbitrary kind and development mechanical functional units of arbitrary kind and development. ADVANTAGE - The servo unit, supported movably along a longitudinal motional trajectory, moved from the initial position to the final position using the actuator and guided back from the final position to the initial position, thus enabling to realize non manual operation of the actuator unit. The actuator unit can be designed in a compact manner and can function in a reliable manner, such that the actuator unit is applicable as low cost product for multiple application possibilities. The necessary components of the actuator unit can be scaled and are not subjected to mechanical wear, such that inspite of miniaturized design the manufacturing cost is kept small and reliable operational reliability of the actuator unit is ensured...|$|E

40|$|Thin {{electrostatic}} septa are {{the most}} critical elements of the main ring extrac-tion system and the beam splitting stations at Fermilab. 1 p 2 Operating experience since the first extracted beam in 1972 has indica-ted several improvements needed over the original septa for both extraction (single cathode) and beam splitting (double cathode) A second generation of septa, now being im-plemented, is described here. Original Fermilab Septa These consist of several modules (4 for beam splitter and 5 for extractor) placed in line to give the required lo-foot length. The modules are accurately aligned inside an aluminum box with a thin stainless steel vat uum skin. It was eventually learned that the alignment is degraded when the vacuum skin is welded on. A typical effective thickness is. 030 ” although the aligyment before welding is accurate to. OOl”. The resulting extraction efficiency for slow spill is limited to about 90 %. The wire plane consists of. 002 ” tung-sten wires with a. 050 ” spacing. The wires are tensioned on an accurately machined aluminum frame. Each wire is hard-soldered to a coil spring on both ends and tensions are individually set at 300 grams. Since one lo-foot septum contains 2400 wires, the assembly is very tedious. Both failure at the solder joints and beam-induced wire breakage have been seri-ous problems, resulting in shorted septa. The welded vacuum skin makes disassembly for repair inefficient. Second Generation Septa The septa now being implemented at Fermilab are characterized by: 1.; 2 one-piece wire support frame, 10 feet long. 2. A simplified wire fastening tech-nique. 3. Improved wire material. 4. <b>Retracting</b> <b>springs</b> to automatically extract broken wires from the high field region. 5. One-piece hollow titanium cathodes, 10 feet long. 6.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the three Americans' system for telegraphy, which {{was first used}} in about 1844, was {{designed}} to make indentations on a paper tape when electric currents were received. Morse's original telegraph receiver used a mechanical clockwork to move a paper tape. When an electrical current was received, an electromagnet engaged an armature that pushed a stylus onto the moving paper tape, making an indentation on the tape. When the current was interrupted, a <b>spring</b> <b>retracted</b> the stylus, and {{that portion of the}} moving tape remained unmarked.|$|R
50|$|An {{electromagnet}} advances (steps) the wipers to {{the next}} position when fed with a pulse of DC. The magnet's armature (spring-loaded) operates a pawl that advances a ratchet. When the pawl reaches its full stroke, it blocks the ratchet so it and the wipers will not overshoot. When power to the coil disconnects, the <b>spring</b> <b>retracts</b> the pawl. Another pawl pivoted on the frame ensures that the wipers do not move backward; contact friction keeps them in place. Some uniselector designs step on application of the operate pulse; others step on its removal.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the stability of temporary anchorage devices, rate of bodily canine retraction and anchorage loss using miniscrews as a skeletal anchorage mean. The sample comprised twelve patients (3 males and 9 females, age range 17 - 28 years) who were scheduled for extraction of upper premolars. After leveling and alignment, a pilot drill was used and titanium miniscrews 1. 2 - 1. 3 mm in diameter and 8 mm length were inserted into the buccal cortical bone between the maxillary second premolars and first molars on both sides. Immediate loading of miniscrews and immediate canine retraction after extraction was performed. The canines were <b>retracted</b> with nitinol <b>springs</b> extending from the canine brackets to the mini-implant. Force magnitude was initially 75 gf and increased to 150 gf after 3 weeks.

5000|$|Ford {{issued a}} nonstandard starter, a {{direct-drive}} [...] "movable pole shoe" [...] design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits. This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay. This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the starter switch. A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated starter relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the starter drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} starter motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a <b>spring</b> <b>retracts</b> the pole shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with the ring gear.|$|R
5000|$|... 3. Not {{having learned}} from {{previous}} uses of this device, the Coyote attaches a spring to a loose rock {{and tries to}} shoot himself toward the Road Runner, but instead the rock is thrown backwards {{and it continues to}} pull the Coyote back like a Newton's cradle until the rock hurtles over the edge of a cliff. Wile E. manages to grab onto the brink and stay put, until the rock flies back the way it came, taking out the entire outcropping and throwing the Coyote across the desert. The two rocks finally detach themselves, but this leads to the broken outcropping forming a see-saw, with Wile E. lying on one end and the big rock landing on the other side. This catapults the Coyote even further, until he falls through a narrow canyon with the rock directly on top, leading to the <b>spring</b> <b>retracting</b> and Wile E. being trapped directly underneath. By loosening the harness, the Coyote escapes and sighs with relief, having escaped with only a fall to the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Tachometers or {{revolution}} counters on cars, aircraft, and other vehicles show {{the rate of}} rotation of the engine's crankshaft, and typically have markings indicating a safe range of rotation speeds. This can assist the driver in selecting appropriate throttle and gear settings for the driving conditions. Prolonged use at high speeds may cause inadequate lubrication, overheating (exceeding capability of the cooling system), exceeding speed capability of sub-parts of the engine (for example <b>spring</b> <b>retracted</b> valves) thus causing excessive wear or permanent damage or failure of engines. This is more applicable to manual transmissions than to automatics. On analogue tachometers, speeds above maximum safe operating speed are typically indicated by {{an area of the}} gauge marked in red, giving rise to the expression of [...] "redlining" [...] an engine — revving the engine up to the maximum safe limit. The red zone is superfluous on most modern cars, since their engines typically have a revolution limiter which electronically limits engine speed to prevent damage. Diesel engines with traditional mechanical injector systems have an integral governor which prevents over-speeding the engine, so the tachometers in vehicles and machinery fitted with such engines sometimes lack a redline.|$|R
40|$|A {{full scale}} {{prototype}} flexible radiator panel was designed, built and tested. The panel, has approximately 173 sq ft of radiating area {{and is designed}} to reject 1. 33 kW of heat to a 0 F sink with a 100 F fluid inlet. The panel is constructed from a flexible Teflon/silver mesh fin surrounding 1 / 8 inch Teflon tubes. The prototype panel is stowed on a 10 inch diameter by 4 foot wide drum. (It rolls up to a diameter of 17 inches when fully stowed). Deployment of the soft tube prototype is via two four inch diameter Kevlar/Mylar inflation tubes with flat springs incorporated in each tube. Nitrogen is normally used for the deployment with approximately 1 psi required. The <b>springs</b> <b>retract</b> the panels when the inflation tubes are deflated. Another method of deployment available for the soft tube flexible is a motor driven deployable boom. This {{eliminates the need for}} expendables when the panel area is varied during the mission for heat load control. The soft tube panel is designed for a 90 % probability of no punctured tube in a 30 day mission. The acceptable working fluids for this soft tube flexible are Coolanol 15, Coolanol 20 and Glycol/water (a eutectic mixture) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a new class}} of implantable intracortical neural probe with small recording electrodes that deploy away from a larger main shank after insertion. This concept is hypothesized to enhance the performance of the electrodes in chronic applications. Today, electrodes that can be implanted into the brain for months or years, are an irreplaceable tool for brain machine interfaces and neuroscience studies. However, these chronically implanted neural probes suffer from continuous loss of signal quality, limiting their utility. Histological studies found a sheath of scar tissue with decreased neural density forming around probe shanks as part of an ongoing chronic inflammation. This was hypothesized to contribute to the deterioration of recorded signals. The neural probes developed in this thesis are designed to deploy electrodes outside this sheath such that they interface with healthier neurons. To achieve this, an actuation mechanism based on starch-hydrogel coated microsprings was integrated into the shank of neural probes. Recording electrodes were positioned at the tip of micrometer fine and flexible needles that were attached to the springs. Before insertion, the hydrogel dehydrates, <b>retracting</b> the <b>springs.</b> After insertion, the gel rehydrates, releasing the springs, which then deploy the electrodes. The actuation mechanism functions in a one-time release fashion, triggered by contact with biological fluids at body temperature. The deployment of the electrodes occurred over the course of two hours and can be divided into three stages: For the first 20 s, the electrodes did not deploy. Within the first three minutes they deployed by roughly 100 µm (0. 5 µm/s). Tor the following two hours they deployed an additional 20 µm (0. 17 µm/min). The employed design supported six deploying electrodes, each {{at the end of a}} 5 µm wide and thick, and 100 µm long needle. These were attached to a shank with 290 µm width, 12 µm thickness and 3 mm length. The shanks could be inserted into the cortex of rats through an opening in the pia without breaking. The acquired waveforms indicate that some of the deployed electrodes were able to record neural action potentials...|$|R
40|$|Because {{the alpha}} proton X ray {{spectrometer}} (APXS) sensor {{head on the}} Mars Pathfinder rover, Sojourner, is placed on Martian soil by the deployment mechanism (ADM), the rover would be crippled if the actuator fails when the mechanism is in its deployed position, as rover ground clearance is then reduced to zero. This paper describes the unique fail-safe mounted on the ADM, especially {{the use of a}} low-temperature-melting alloy as a coupler device. The final form of the design is a low-melting-point metal pellet coupler, made from Cerrobend, in parallel with a Negator spring pack. In its solid state, the metal rigidly connects the driver (the actuator) and the driven part (the mechanism). When commanded, a strip heater wrapped around the coupler melts the metal pellet (at 60 (deg) C), allowing the driven part to turn independent of the driver. The Negator <b>spring</b> <b>retracts</b> the mechanism to its fully stowed position. This concept meets all the design criteria, and provides an added benefit. When the metal hardens the coupler once again rigidly connects the actuator and the mechanism. The concept presented here can easily be applied to other applications. Anywhere release devices are needed, low-melting-point couplers can be considered. The issues to be concerned with are thermal isolation, proper setting of the parts before actuation, and possible outgassing concerns. However, when these issues are overcome, the resulting release mechanism can promise to be the most light, simple, power conserving alternative available...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{individual}} canine retraction using HYCON device and Nickel Titanium closed coil springs. Materials and Methods: The sample consists of 20 patients, 10 males and 10 females. Class 1 bimaxillary protrusion cases {{were selected for}} the study with age group ranging from 14 to 23 years. HYCON device {{was placed on the}} right side of the maxillary arch and Nickel Titanium closed coil spring were placed on left side of the maxillary arch. Lateral cephalograms, OPG and study models were taken before retraction (T 0) and records were taken after retraction (T 1). Results: The duration of this study is for 3 months. HYCON device retracted canines by 2. 42 mm/mo whereas NiTi closed coil <b>spring</b> <b>retracted</b> canines by 1. 34 mm/mo in a period of 3 months. Anchorage loss with a minimal of 1. 40 mm is seen in HYCON device whereas in case of NiTi closed coil spring the anchorage loss was 3. 35 mm. The angular rotation of canines measured was found to be 2. 59 degrees in HYCON device and 10. 80 in NiTi closed coil spring. Clinically and radiologically, in most of the cases canines moved bodily with 1. 90 degrees of tipping for HYCON device while NiTi closed coil spring canine tipping was 6. 95 degrees. Conclusion: For rapid space closure HYCON device is a promising appliance. With HYCON device, canines can be completely retracted in 3 months and there was bodily movement of canines seen in all cases with minimum amount of tipping...|$|R

40|$|Richtmyer-Meshkov (R-M) {{instability}} {{occurs when}} two different density fluids are impulsively accelerated {{in the direction}} normal to their nearly planar interface. The instability causes small perturbations on the interface to grow and possibly become turbulent given the proper initial conditions. R-M instability {{is similar to the}} Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability, which is generated when the two fluids undergo a constant acceleration. R-M instability is a fundamental fluid instability that is important to fields ranging from astrophysics to high-speed combustion. For example, R-M instability is currently the limiting factor in achieving a net positive yield with inertial confinement fusion. The experiments described here utilize a novel technique that circumvents many of the experimental difficulties previously limiting the study of the R-M instability. A Plexiglas tank contains two unequal density liquids and is gently oscillated horizontally to produce a controlled initial fluid interface shape. The tank is mounted to a sled on a high speed, low friction linear rail system, constraining the main motion to the vertical direction. The sled is released from an initial height and falls vertically until it bounces off of a movable spring, imparting an impulsive acceleration in the upward direction. As the sled travels up and down the rails, the <b>spring</b> <b>retracts</b> out of the way, allowing the instability to evolve in free-fall until impacting a shock absorber {{at the end of the}} rails. The impulsive acceleration provided to the system is measured by a piezoelectric accelerometer mounted on the tank, and a capacitive accelerometer measures the low-level drag of the bearings. Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence is used for flow visualization, which uses an Argon ion laser to illuminate the flow and a CCD camera, mounted to the sled, to capture images of the interface. This experimental study investigates the instability of an interface between incompressible, miscible liquids with an initial sinusoidal perturbation. The amplitude of the disturbance during the experiment is measured and compared to theory. The results show good agreement (within 10 %) with linear stability theory up to nondimensional amplitude ka = 0. 7 (wavenumber x amplitude). These results hold true for an initial ka (before acceleration) of - 0. 7 less than ka less than - 0. 06, while the linear theory was developed for absolute value of ka much less than 1. In addition, a third order weakly nonlinear perturbation theory is shown to be accurate for amplitudes as large as ka = 1. 3, even though the interface becomes double-valued at ka = 1. 1. As time progresses, the vorticity on the interface concentrates, and the interface spirals around the alternating sign vortex centers to form a mushroom pattern. At higher Reynolds Number (based on circulation), an instability of the vortex cores has been observed. While time limitations of the apparatus prevent determination of a critical Reynolds Number, the lowest Reynolds Number this vortex instability has been observed at is 5000...|$|R
