40|$|The <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>lory</b> is an endemic parrot {{species from}} Talaud Islands, North Sulawesi. The use of {{existing}} resources is suspected that occurs of selection including the roosting trees. The research aims to identifying {{the characteristics of}} <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Lory</b> roost tree and determining variables in its selection. We measured 14 variables to identify the characteristics and selection of roost tree. Mann-Whitney test, T-test, Chi-sqare test and Binary Logistic Regression were employed to analyze data. We detected 11 roost trees in study field, there are Gehe (Pometia coriacea Radkl) nine individual, Binsar (Ficus variegata) and Lawean (Sterculia sp) one individual. The Chi-square test identified five variables which related to roost tree selection, i. e; branch-free bole length, canopy diameter, canopy density {{and the number of}} trees around the roost tree on diameter 20 - 40 cm and > 41 cm. The Logistic regression analysis detected three variables that gave the most influence on roost tree selection, but branch-free bole length gave the most influence on roost tree selection...|$|E

25|$|For {{the left}} distribution, {{the size of}} the areas of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> are {{approximately}} proportional to the widths of each <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> bar. Therefore, the numbers drawn from this distribution will approximately follow Benford's law. On the other hand, for the right distribution, the ratio of the areas of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> {{is very different from the}} ratio of the widths of each <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> bar. Rather, the relative areas of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> are determined more by the height of the bars than the widths. Accordingly, the first digits in this distribution do not satisfy Benford's law at all.|$|R

25|$|Kempe {{also showed}} {{correctly}} that G {{can have no}} vertex of degree 4. As before we remove the vertex v and four-color the remaining vertices. If all four neighbors of v are different colors, say <b>red,</b> green, <b>blue,</b> <b>and</b> yellow in clockwise order, we look for an alternating path of vertices colored <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> joining the <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> neighbors. Such a path is called a Kempe chain. There may be a Kempe chain joining the <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> neighbors, <b>and</b> {{there may be a}} Kempe chain joining the green and yellow neighbors, but not both, since these two paths would necessarily intersect, and the vertex where they intersect cannot be colored. Suppose it is the <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> neighbors that are not chained together. Explore all vertices attached to the red neighbor by red-blue alternating paths, and then reverse the colors <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> on all these vertices. The result is still a valid four-coloring, and v can now be added back <b>and</b> colored <b>red.</b>|$|R

50|$|Leonardo learns through spatial scaffolding. One of {{the ways}} a teacher teaches is by {{positioning}} objects near to the student that they expect the student to use. This same technique, spatial scaffolding, {{can be used with}} Leonardo, who is taught to build a sailboat from virtual blocks, using only the <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> blocks.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} symbols of International Fire Fighters Day is the <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> ribbon. This ribbon is cut precisely five centimeters long and one centimeter wide, with the two separate colors conjoined at the top. JJ Edmonson chose <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> because the <b>red</b> stood for the element of fire whereas the blue would represent the element of water. Coincidentally, <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> are also the colors recognized world-wide to signify emergency services; therefore, <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> being the best choice of color to recognize an international holiday. The ribbon is traditionally worn on the lapel-otherwise known as the fold of fabric on a shirt- but is not limited to that certain spot. Some people may also put it on their cars visors, hats, hang them in windows or off of car mirrors, or even hang them from trees in their front lawn. The places this ribbon can be placed are plentiful- just be creative! The <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> ribbon is a simple but yet effective way to show support for International Fire Fighters Day.|$|R
