2500|$|Though {{they were}} now living in Hawaii, the Japanese picture brides still felt it was {{important}} to preserve their traditions and heritage. The values they tried to instill in their children were filial piety, obligation to community and authority (on in the Japanese language), <b>reciprocal</b> <b>obligation</b> (giri in Japanese), the importance of hard work, perseverance, frugality, and a drive for success (seiko in Japanese). Many picture brides worked on the plantations. In 1920 fourteen percent of the workers on the plantations were female, and of those female workers, eighty percent were Japanese. On the plantation they usually irrigated and weeded the fields, stripped cane of dry leaves, or cut seed cane. Men were given similar tasks, but were often paid more. For example, in 1915 Japanese women plantation workers made 55 cents compared to the 78 cents made by their male counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|The Indians were {{organized}} into kinship and clan networks, and marrying {{a woman from}} one of these kinship networks would make a fur trader into a member of these networks, thereby ensuring that Indians belonging to whatever clan the trader had married into {{were more likely to}} deal only with him. Furthermore, the fur traders discovered that the Indians were more likely to share food, especially during the hard months of winter, to those fur traders who were regarded as part of their communities. One fur trader who married a 18-year old Ojibwa girl described in his diary his [...] "secret satisfaction at being compelled to marry for my safety". The converse of such marriages was that a fur trader was expected to favor whatever clan/kinship network that he had married into with European goods, and a fur trader who did not would ruin his reputation. For the Ojibwa, like the other Indians, saw all life in this world being based upon reciprocal relationships, with Ojibwa women leaving behind [...] "gifts" [...] of tobacco when harvesting plants to thank nature for providing the plants while when a bear was killed, a ceremony was held to thank the bear for [...] "giving" [...] up its life to them. The Ojibwa believed if the plants and animals were not thanked for [...] "giving" [...] themselves to them, then the plants and animals would be less [...] "giving" [...] the next year, and the same principle applied to their relations with other peoples such as the fur traders. The Ojibwa, like other First Nations, always believed that animals willingly allowed themselves to be killed, and that if a hunter failed to give thanks to the animal world, then the animals would be less [...] "giving" [...] the next time around. As the fur traders were predominately male and heterosexual while there were few white women beyond the frontier, the Indians were well aware of the sexual attraction felt by the fur traders towards their women, who were seen as having a special power over white men. From the Ojibwa viewpoint, if one of their women gave herself to a fur trader, it created the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>obligation</b> for the fur trader to give back. Fur-trading companies encouraged their employees to take Indian wives, not only to built long-term relationships that were good for business, but also because an employee with a wife would have to buy more supplies from his employer, with the money for the purchases usually subtracted from his wages. White decried the tendency of many historians to see these women as simply [...] "passive" [...] objects that were bartered for by fur traders and Indian tribal elders, writing that these women had [...] "exert influence and be active communicators of information" [...] to effective as the wife of a fur trader, and that many of the women who married fur traders [...] "embraced" [...] these marriages to achieve [...] "useful purposes for themselves and for the communities that they lived in". One study of the Ojibwa women who married French fur traders maintained {{that the majority of the}} brides were [...] "exceptional" [...] women with [...] "unusual ambitions, influenced by dreams and visions-like the women who become hunters, traders, healers and warriors in Ruth Landes's account of Ojibwa women". Out of these relationships emerged the Métis people whose culture was a fusion of French and Indian elements.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, {{the ethical}} {{consequences}} of guanxi {{have been brought}} into question. While guanxi can bring benefits to people directly within the guanxi network, {{it also has the}} potential to bring harm to individuals, societies and nations when misused or abused. For example, mutual <b>reciprocal</b> <b>obligation</b> is a major component of guanxi. However, the specific date, time and method are often unspecified. Thus, guanxi can be ethically questionable when one party takes advantage of others’ personal favors, without seeking to reciprocate. A common example of unethical <b>reciprocal</b> <b>obligation</b> involves the abuse of business-government relations. In 2013, a CCP (Chinese Communist Party) official criticised the government officials for using public funds of over 10,000 yuan for banquets. This totals to approximately 48 billion dollars worth of banquets per year. Guanxi may also allow for interpersonal obligations to take precedence over civic duties.|$|E

Staying in contact with members of your network is not necessary to bind <b>reciprocal</b> <b>obligations.</b> <b>Reciprocal</b> favors are the key factor to maintaining one’s guanxi web, while failure to reciprocate is considered an unforgivable offense (that is, the more one asks of someone, the more one owes them).

According to the authors, before agriculture, sex was relatively promiscuous, and paternity was not a concern, in a similar way to the mating system of Bonobos.

50|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} in the recording industry to sign many emerging artists like Wham!, banking that long-term profits from the few commercial successes would cover the losses from promoting the remainder. A decision holding Michael's contract unenforceable could have dramatically reduced the expected return on investment for signing and promoting an emerging artist, leading to fears that the practice would end. Michael argued that {{the structure of the}} industry concentrated power in too few hands, and that these companies competed by selling music but not in the terms offered to new artists. This led to an imbalance of power where the artist was contractually obligated to produce a set number of albums of acceptable quality and cede copyright to the label, but the label did not bear a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>obligation</b> to market and promote the product, in accordance with the artist's wishes or otherwise.|$|E
