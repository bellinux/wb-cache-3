40|$|Auctions are {{a popular}} {{way to raise}} money for charities, but {{relatively}} little is known, either theoretically or empirically, about the properties of charity auctions. The small theoretical literature suggests that the all-pay auction should garner more money than winner-pay auctions. We conduct field experiments to test which sealed bid format, first price, second price or all-pay raises the most money. Our experiment suggests that both the all-pay and second price formats are dominated by the first price auction. Our design also allows us to identify differential participation as the source of the difference between existing theory and the field. To conclude, we show that a model of charity auctions augmented by an endogenous participation decision predicts the <b>revenue</b> <b>ordering</b> that we see in the field. ...|$|R

5000|$|Tilakchand died aged 37, {{leaving a}} minor son, Tejchand. His widow, Rani Vishnukumari, managed {{the affairs of}} the estate between 1776 and 1779, before handing over charge to her 14-year-old son Tejchand. Under the terms of the Permanent Settlement of Bengal Act (1793), Raja Tejchand entered into an {{agreement}} with the HEIC to pay them an annual revenue of Rs./- and also a [...] "bridge-building charge" [...] of Rs. /-. These terms also proved impossible to meet, and payments soon fell into arrears. Soon enough, in 1797, the Board of <b>Revenue</b> <b>ordered</b> the sale of portions of the fief for realization of arrears of revenue. The Permanent Settlement effected by the British, with its unreasonable revenue demands, drained the province of its very sustanance. The pressure on the landlords to meet these unreasonable demands resulted in the gradual but inexorable immiseration of the peasantry.|$|R

40|$|According to {{previous}} studies, speculative trades generate positively autocorrelated returns. Therefore, {{we focus on}} speculative stocks that reach to 52 -week new high records. They might be possibly with more information inside because they have kept good performance in earnings or <b>revenues.</b> <b>Order</b> imbalance (OI) is employed as a proxy of information asymmetry in this article. Relation between intraday return and OI is investigated under a time-varying framework. A contemporaneous significant positive relation exists {{in all kinds of}} interval tests, especially for 90 -second and 3 -minute intervals. The coefficients of lagged OIs are negative but not significant. It can be explained as asymmetric information effect. After controlling for contemporaneous OI, it shows continuation in lag-one relations in 90 -second interval. In 3 -minute and 15 -minute interval tests, the results are mixed. Finally, the relation of contemporaneous coefficients and market capitalization is significantly negative. It implies that there is more information asymmetry in smaller firms. ...|$|R
40|$|In this research, we {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} gender in analyzing the performance of sponsored search advertising. We examine a log file with data comprised of nearly 7, 000, 000 records spanning 33 consecutive months of a search engine marketing campaign from a major US retailer. We classify key phrases selected for the campaign with a probability of being targeted for a specific gender and then compare the consumer actions using the critical sponsored search metrics of impressions, clicks, cost-per-click, sales <b>revenue,</b> <b>orders,</b> and items sold. Findings from our analysis show that the gender-orientation of the key phrase is a significant determinant in predicting behaviors and performance, with statistically different consumer behaviors for all attributes as {{the probability of a}} male or female keyword phrase changes. However, gender neutral phrases perform the best overall, calling into question the benefits of demographic targeting. Insight from this research could result in sponsored results being more effectively targeted to searchers and potential consumers...|$|R
