40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to compute <b>reduced</b> <b>normal</b> <b>equations</b> from the observational data of several different systems described below to combine them eventually with the normal equations of the Wild BC- 4 observations taken in the DOD/DOC cooperative worldwide geodetic satellite program and provide station coordinates from a single least squares adjustment.

The observational systems combined were the Baker-Nunn simultaneous camera observational systems combined were the Baker-Nunn simultaneous camera observations from the SAO worldwide network, the MOTS and PC- 1000 optical observations in North America, miscellaneous camera observations in Europe which were included in the SAO 69 solution, and, lastly, a group of optical observations where Baker-Nunn cameras observed simultaneously with MOTS and/or PC- 1000 cameras in the previously mentioned group...|$|E
40|$|Bundle {{adjustment}} {{with additional}} parameters {{is identified as}} a critical step for precise orthoimage generation and 3 D reconstruction of Dunhuang wall paintings. Due {{to the introduction of}} self-calibration parameters and quasi-planar constraints, the structure of coefficient matrix of the <b>reduced</b> <b>normal</b> <b>equation</b> is banded-bordered, making the solving process of bundle adjustment complex. In this paper, Conjugate Gradient Bundle Adjustment (CGBA) method is deduced by calculus of variations. A preconditioning method based on improved incomplete Cholesky factorization is adopt to reduce the condition number of coefficient matrix, as well as to accelerate the iteration rate of CGBA. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results comparison with conventional method indicate that, the proposed method can effectively conquer the ill-conditioned problem of <b>normal</b> <b>equation</b> and improve the calculation efficiency of bundle adjustment with additional parameters considerably, while maintaining the actual accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) TDRSS data to geopotential model recovery is assessed. Simulated TDRSS one-way and Bilateration Ranging Transponder System (BRTS) observations have been generated and orbitally <b>reduced</b> to form <b>normal</b> <b>equations</b> for geopotential parameters. These normals have been combined {{with those of}} the latest prelaunch T/P gravity model solution using data from over 30 satellites. A study of the resulting solution error covariance shows that TDRSS can make important contributions to geopotential recovery, especially for improving T/P specific effects like those arising from orbital resonance. It is argued that future effort is desirable both to establish TDRSS orbit determination limits in a reference frame compatible with that used for the precise laser/DORIS orbits, and the reduction of these TDRSS data for geopotential recovery...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semi-analytical two-dimensional method for the fracture analysis of railheads containing internal cracks. The {{boundaries of the}} railhead and internal cracks are modelled by continuous distribution of dislocations. This approach provides a system of singular integral equations that are <b>reduced</b> to <b>normal</b> algebraic <b>equations</b> first and then solved numerically to obtain the dislocation distribution functions along the crack surfaces and the boundaries. Stress intensity factors associated with the internal cracks are then calculated and analysed. This method has provided numerical results that compare well with the finite element solutions. The advantage of the method is realised {{that it does not}} require any meshing including idealisation of the shape of the cracks and/ or the boundary. The potential sources of errors in using the current method is also presented...|$|R
40|$|We study {{elliptic}} lower dimensional invariant tori of Hamiltonian systems via parameterizations. The {{method is}} based in solving iteratively the functional equations that stand for invariance and reducibility. In contrast with classical methods, we do not assume {{that the system is}} close to integrable nor that is written in action-angle variables. We only require an approximation of an invariant torus of fixed vector of basic frequencies and a basis along the torus that approximately <b>reduces</b> the <b>normal</b> variational <b>equations</b> to constant coefficients. We want to highlight that this approach presents many advantages compared with methods which are built in terms of canonical transformations, e. g., it produces simpler and more constructive proofs that lead to more efficient numerical algorithms for the computation of these objects. Such numerical algorithms are suitable to be adapted in order to perform computer ssisted proofs. Preprin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical method {{based on the}} principle of continuous distribution of dislocation to model curved cracks in solids of arbitrarily shaped finite geometries. Both the boundary of the finite body and the curved crack are modelled by distributed dislocation. In this method the influence function of the dislocation along the finite body boundary is reduced to a product of the Hilbert kernel with a normal function. Similarly the influence function for the curved cracks is reduced to the product of Cauchy kernel and a normal function. This approach results in a system of singular integral equations. Using the order decreasing method, the system is <b>reduced</b> to <b>normal</b> integral <b>equations,</b> which are solved numerically. Stress intensity factors are evaluated for a well-known crack problem and two railhead crack problems with a view to assessing the capability of the developed method to solve complex engineering problems...|$|R

The storage {{required for the}} method {{is no more than}} that needed for the conventional <b>normal</b> <b>equations</b> approach. However, the <b>normal</b> <b>equations</b> are not computed; orthogonal transformations are applied to the coefficient matrix, thus avoiding the potential numerical instability associated with computing the <b>normal</b> <b>equations.</b> Our approach allows full exploitation of sparsity, and permits the use of a fixed (static) data structure during the numerical computation.

30|$|In active set methods, {{solving the}} core {{unconstrained}} least-squares problem is independent from {{the construction of}} the active set. To accelerate the core unconstrained least-squares solver, Myre et al. (2018) developed the TNT algorithm. The TNT algorithm implements the Cholesky factor of the <b>normal</b> <b>equations</b> as a preconditioner to a left-preconditioned conjugate gradient normal residual (PCGNR) method (Saad 2003). PCGNR {{can be thought of as}} a computationally cheap mechanism that iteratively improves the solution.

The numerical issues typically associated with the <b>normal</b> <b>equations</b> and the condition number of the problem are thereby avoided.|$|R

Results show that all the above methods cannot select the optimal reference satellite. We introduce condition number of the design matrix in the reference satellite selection method to improve structure of the <b>normal</b> <b>equation,</b> because condition number can indicate the ill condition of the <b>normal</b> <b>equation.</b> The experimental results show that the new method can improve positioning accuracy and reliability in precise relative positioning...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGiven a Hamiltonian system, Ziglin′s theorem {{is one of}} the {{criteria}} used to study the integrability of the system. For this we make use of the variational equations along a known solution. In this paper we obtain some consequences of the application of Picard-Vessiot differential Galois theory to Ziglin′s theorem. First we present the general results for the case of a finite arbitrary number of degrees of freedom. Then we pass to the case of two degrees of freedom where the results can be given with more detail. Under the hypothesis of Ziglin′s theorem and some additional technical assumptions the main results (Theorems 1 and 2) relate the integrability of the Hamiltonian with the properties of the differential Galois group of the Picard Vessiot extension associated to the <b>normal</b> <b>reduced</b> variational <b>equations.</b> For two degrees of freedom it is possible to study also the resonant case. Theorems 4 and 5 give the full classification of the Galois groups and the related extensions in the integrable case.
