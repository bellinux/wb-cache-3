The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify individual {{differences in}} Russian consumers according to their perceptions of health <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits associated with fish consumption. By application of a cluster analysis on perceptions of personal <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits associated with the consumption of fish, four groups of Russian consumers were classified as: very positive; positive; moderately positive; and ‘high risk–high benefit’ about the healthiness of fish consumption. Differences in perceptions of personal <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits across consumers were related to self-reported fish consumption, optimism about personal <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits, and optimism about personal knowledge about <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits. Implications for the development of targeted health interventions to influence perceptions of <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits associated with fish consumption, and ultimately fish consumption, are discussed. It is concluded that optimism regarding perceptions and knowledge of health <b>risks,</b> <b>and</b> health benefits should be taken into account when developing interventions aimed at consumer health...|$|R

5|$|Risk parity is a {{conceptual}} approach to investing which attempts {{to provide a}} lower <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> lower fee alternative to the traditional portfolio allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds which carries 90% of its risk in the stock portion of the portfolio (see illustration). The risk parity approach attempts to equalize risk by allocating funds to {{a wider range of}} categories such as stocks, government bonds, credit-related securities and inflation hedges (including real assets, commodities, real estate and inflation-protected bonds), while maximizing gains through financial leveraging. According to Bob Prince, CIO at Bridgewater Associates, the defining parameters of a traditional risk parity portfolio are uncorrelated assets, low equity <b>risk,</b> <b>and</b> passive management.|$|E

This indicates that EPU increases banks’ credit <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> negatively influences loan size, especially for joint-equity banks. Given the increasing credit risks generated by EPU, banks can improve operational performance by reducing loan sizes. Further research indicates {{that the effects of}} EPU on banks’ credit <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> lending decisions are moderated by the marketization level, with financial depth moderating the effect on banks’ credit <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> strengthening it on lending decisions...|$|R

Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs.

40|$|Objectives. To examine {{beliefs about}} {{medication}} <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits in patients attending a specialist rheumatology clinic for pain-related conditions. Methods. Eighty-one patients (37 first attendees and 44 existing clinic patients) completed a written questionnaire which asked about current treatments, perceived effectiveness, main <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits, and compliance. Results. Existing clinic patients perceived medications {{to be more}} effective and more risky than did the new patients, although both groups rated risks to be moderately low. The main perceived risks were adverse side-effects, although patients reported only moderately low levels of experiencing such effects. Conclusions. In contrast to some other studies, many of our patients were aware of medication <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> were prepared to accept them provided benefits were seen to be high. Existing clinic patients were more aware of <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits, and reported higher compliance levels than new patients, possibly {{as a result of the}} hospital education programme.
