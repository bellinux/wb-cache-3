5|$|The coast at Holkham {{originally}} {{consisted of}} salt marshes {{protected from the}} sea by <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> shingle and sand.|$|E
5|$|Isolated <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> lava and {{hydrothermally}} altered rock, {{especially in}} the area of Sherman Crater, are exposed between glaciers on the upper flanks of the volcano; the lower flanks are steep and heavily vegetated. Volcanic rocks of Mount Baker and Black Buttes rest on a foundation of non-volcanic rocks.|$|E
5|$|Morchella snyderi can be {{distinguished}} from similar North American morels by differences in ecological and morphological features. M.frustrata resembles young specimens of M.snyderi, but the <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> the caps of the former species do not darken in maturity, and it has smaller ascospores, measuring 20–29 by 14–19µm. Another potential lookalike, M.brunnea, has a browner fruit body color in young specimens, and a stipe that is not lacunose.|$|E

5|$|The {{geological}} features {{near the}} headwaters of Catawissa Creek primarily include anthracite and <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> sandstone. The valleys {{in this part of}} the watershed are narrow and steep. Elsewhere in the watershed, the topography consists mostly of less steep valleys and some hills.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{activity}} in the Quantocks from prehistoric times includes finds of Mesolithic flints at North Petherton and Broomfield and many Bronze Age round barrows (marked on maps as tumulus, plural tumuli), such as Thorncombe Barrow above Bicknoller. Several ancient stones can be seen, such as the Triscombe Stone and the Long Stone above Holford. Many of the tracks along <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> the Quantocks probably originated as ancient ridgeways. A Bronze Age hill fort, Norton Camp, was built to the south at Norton Fitzwarren, close to the centre of bronze making in Taunton.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather that}} had absorbed a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Two-E. It became a tropical storm the next day. After peaking on June 9, with a pressure of 997mb, steering currents collapsed and Boris stalled out in the ocean between two <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> high pressure. Shear increased, and the cyclone weakened to a depression on June 10. The next day, Boris degenerated into a remnant low. The remnant drifted east and then southeast before dissipating on June 12.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ridge</b> <b>of</b> Capard (...) is a {{mountain}} in Laois, Ireland. <b>Ridge</b> <b>of</b> Capard's summit {{is at an}} altitude of 483 m, making it the third-highest point in Laois, the sixth-highest in the Slieve Bloom Mountains and the 614th-highest summit in Ireland.|$|R
2500|$|The Lehigh Valley, which {{includes}} all of Lehigh and Northampton counties, is bounded {{on the north}} by Blue Mountain, a <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> the Appalachian mountain range with an altitude of 1,300 to , and on the south by South Mountain, a <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> 700 to [...] that cuts through the southern portions of the two counties. The highest point in Lehigh County is Bake Oven Knob, a mass of Tuscarora conglomeratic rocks that rise about [...] above the main <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> the Blue Mountain in northwestern Heidelberg Township.|$|R

For most people, a rook piercing through a prominent <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> cartilage will give the jewelry a vertical appearance as the piercing goes {{from top to bottom}} of the surface.|$|R
5|$|Routes up Helvellyn {{can begin}} from {{the villages of}} Glenridding or Patterdale to the east, Grasmere to the south, or {{from a number of}} places along the A591 road to the west, and can follow any of the mountain's five ridges, or the <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> its neighbours, {{as well as some of}} the gills and {{shoulders}} on the west side of the range. Walkers can choose between many routes.|$|E
5|$|The fourth lower premolar (p4) {{is known}} from a poorly {{preserved}} specimen from Oberdorf and a less worn specimen from Tägernaustrasse. There are four <b>ridges,</b> <b>of</b> which {{the front and}} back pair are connected at the lingual side and in the Oberdorf specimen also at the labial side. This tooth {{is similar to that of}} Muscardinus hispanicus, but the front pair is better developed. There is one root.|$|E
5|$|At 1:00 pm on December 10, General Matsui {{ordered all}} units {{to launch a}} {{full-scale}} attack on Nanking. That day the SEA assaulted China's super-elite Training Brigade on the peaks of Zijinshan, which dominate Nanking's northeast horizon. Clambering up the <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> the mountain, {{the men of the}} SEA had to painstakingly wrest control of each Chinese encampment one by one in bloody infantry charges. Advancing along the south side of Zijinshan was no easier as General Matsui had forbidden his men from using artillery there due to his deep conviction that no damage should come to its two famous historical sites, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.|$|E

Garden Mountain {{was part of the}} ancient dome.|$|R
50|$|The Lehigh Valley, which {{includes}} all of Lehigh and Northampton counties, is bounded {{on the north}} by Blue Mountain, a <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> the Appalachian mountain range with an altitude of 1,300 to 1604 ft, and on the south by South Mountain, a <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> 700 to 1100 ft that cuts through the southern portions of the two counties. The highest point in Lehigh County is Bake Oven Knob, a mass of Tuscarora conglomeratic rocks that rise about 100 ft above the main <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> the Blue Mountain in northwestern Heidelberg Township.|$|R
5|$|Black Creek is {{situated}} within the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. Rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pottsville Formation, and the Llwellyn Formation. Coal {{beds in the}} watershed include the Lower Red Ash bed, the Upper Red Ash bed, the Lower Ross bed, the Upper Ross bed, and the Baltimore Bed. <b>Ridges</b> <b>of</b> mine waste also occur in the creek's drainage basin. Mining {{was done in the}} watershed as early as the winter of 1836-1837, but it stopped in 1955. The creek and the surrounding areas were the subject of a joint study by several federal and state organizations in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} coast are Goat Cave and Clamshell Cave. The latter is 10m high, about 6m wide at the entrance, and some 45m long, and {{on one side of}} it the <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> basalt stand out like the ribs of a ship. Near this cave is the {{pyramidal}} rock islet of Am Buachaille ('The Herdsman'), a pile of basalt columns seen fully only at low tide. Other outlying rocks include Eilean Dubh to the north-west and a series of skerries stretching for half a kilometre to the south-west. On the southwest shore are Boat Cave and Mackinnon's Cave (named after a 15th-century abbot of Iona), which has a tunnel connecting it to Cormorant Cave. These caves lie to the south-west and can be accessed from the bay of Port an Fhasgaidh at low tide. In 1945 a mine exploded near Boat Cave, causing damage to the cliff face which is still visible. Mackinnon's Cave is 107 metres long.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (<b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman force {{prepared}} to repel a landing {{on either side}} of the Straits was the 5th Army. This force, which initially consisted of five divisions with another en route, was a conscript force, commanded by von Sanders. Many of the senior officers in the 5th Army were also German. Ottoman commanders and senior German officers debated the best means of defending the peninsula. All agreed that the best defence was to hold the high ground on the <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> the peninsula. There was disagreement as to where the enemy would land and hence where to concentrate forces. Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kemal was familiar with the Gallipoli peninsula from his operations against Bulgaria in the Balkan Wars and forecast that Cape Helles (the southern tip of the peninsula) and Gaba Tepe were the likely areas for landing.|$|E
5|$|The {{almond-shaped}} spores {{are typically}} 10–12.5 by 6–7μm with thick walls measuring between 0.5–1.2μm. They {{have a small}} central apiculus (a depressed area when the spore was once attached to the basidium via the sterigma). When mounted in distilled water, they have a coarsely warty surface and appear rusty brown in colour. When mounted in a 3% KOH solution, the spores are pale lilac grey, and the surface ornamentation forms swollen pustules that loosen and dissolve. Spores are dextrinoid (meaning they turn reddish-brown when stained with Melzer's reagent) and cyanophilic (red in acetocarmine). The basidia are club-shaped, and four-spored with sterigmata up to 9.5μm long. The <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> the locules comprise erect cystidia mixed with chains of erect cylindrical hyphae measuring 4–6μm in diameter. The cystidia are roughly cylindrical, and have dimensions of 20–60 by 4–9μm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|The right atrium {{receives}} blood almost continuously {{from the}} body's two major veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. A {{small amount of}} blood from the coronary circulation also drains into the right atrium via the coronary sinus, which is immediately above and {{to the middle of}} the opening of the inferior vena cava. In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. Most of the internal surface of the right atrium is smooth, the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the anterior surface has prominent <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> pectinate muscles, which are also present in the right atrial appendage.|$|E

5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} {{identified}} two teeth, MACN Pv-RN 249 and 250, as anterior upper premolars. 249 bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. One row (row A; possibly the lingual one) includes four cusps, the other (row B) includes at least two, but is damaged. In row A, {{there are three}} ridges (at the front, middle, and back) extending {{from the tip of}} the base of each cusp. The second and third cusps are largest and most widely separated from each other. In row B, one cusp bears three <b>ridges,</b> <b>of</b> which one extends towards the other cusp in the row and the two others towards row A) and the other cusp is damaged. 250 is more fragmentary, but bears at least five cusps and may represent the same tooth position as 249, though it would come from {{the opposite side of the}} mouth. The microstructure of the enamel of this tooth has been studied. With a width of about 55μm near the tip of a cusp, the enamel is thin. The enamel prisms are straight, small, and rounded and there is little material between the prisms. Small, rounded prisms are also seen in Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica, and other gondwanatheres, but in few multituberculates. Even in those multituberculates that do have small prisms, the prism sheath is closed, but the sheath is incomplete in Gondwanatherium and possibly Ferugliotherium.|$|E
5|$|US40Scenic {{is the old}} {{alignment}} of US40 over Town Hill and Sideling Hill, two of the many northsouth <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians between Cumberland and Hancock {{that needed to be}} crossed first by the Baltimore and Cumberland Turnpike, then US40, and most recently I-68. The portion of US40Scenic from its western terminus over Town Hill to Sideling Hill Creek follows the original {{alignment of}} the turnpike and US40 except for deviations at both ends due to construction of the new alignments of US40 and I-68. The Baltimore and Cumberland Turnpike and later US40 rose abruptly from Sideling Hill Creek to climb the west flank of Sideling Hill, following what is today McFarland Road east, turning south at Hixon Road, and continuing south along the same line, now abandoned, to join the present line {{at the top of the}} mountain. On the east flank, the old road began along the current alignment, then turned east a short distance south of the present curve to the east for a steeper descent that followed Western Pike before joining the present alignment a short distance west of MD144.|$|E
