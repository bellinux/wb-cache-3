40|$|Since {{the packet}} is {{transmitted}} {{to a set}} of relaying nodes in opportunistic routing strategy, so the transmission delay and the duplication transmission are serious. For reducing the transmission delay and the duplicate transmission, in this paper, we propose the delay based duplication transmission avoid (DDA) coordination scheme for opportunistic routing. In this coordination scheme, the candidate relaying nodes are divided into different fully connected <b>relaying</b> <b>networks,</b> so the duplicate transmission is avoided. Moreover, we propose the <b>relaying</b> <b>network</b> recognition algorithm which can be used to judge whether the sub-network is fully connected or not. The properties of the <b>relaying</b> <b>networks</b> are investigated in detail in this paper. When the fully connected <b>relaying</b> <b>networks</b> are got, they will be the basic units in the next hop <b>relaying</b> <b>network</b> selection. In this paper, we prove that the packet delivery ratio of the high priority relaying nodes in the <b>relaying</b> <b>network</b> has greater effection on the relaying delay than that of the low priority relaying nodes. According to this conclusion, in DDA, the <b>relaying</b> <b>networks</b> which the packet delivery ratios of the high priority relaying nodes are high have higher priority than that of the low one. During the next hop <b>relaying</b> <b>network</b> selection, the transmission delay, the network utility, and the packet delivery ratio are taken into account. By these innovations, the DDA can improve the network performance greatly than that of ExOR and SOAR. Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures, 18 formula...|$|R
3000|$|To {{get all the}} {{benefits}} of the two-path relaying, an accurate channel estimation is required. For the cooperative <b>relaying</b> <b>networks,</b> many works focusing on the channel estimation can be found in [9 – 12]. Lalos et al. [9] proposed a hybrid channel estimation scheme utilizing both training sequence and channel output correlation information for three-node cooperative <b>relaying</b> <b>networks.</b> Gao et al. [10] presented a Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)-based training design and channel estimation for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver in two-way <b>relaying</b> <b>networks.</b> Under the situation where multiple relays exist, the performance of the best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation was respectively investigated in [11, 12]. Although the various channel estimation schemes have been studied for use in cooperative <b>relaying</b> <b>networks</b> [9 – 12], a practical channel estimation for the two-path <b>relaying</b> <b>networks</b> has not been extensively studied in the literature. In particular, since the interference cancellation and channel estimation are mutually conditional, the conventional estimation methods in [9 – 12] cannot be applied to the two-path <b>relaying</b> <b>networks.</b> In [13], a channel estimation for AF-based two-path relaying was proposed.

25|$|The <b>relay</b> <b>network</b> opened between 1960 and 1968 {{and covered}} the {{segments}} Oslo–Bergen, the coast from Oslo via Kristiansund, Bergen, Stavanger and Ålesund to Trondheim, and from Oslo via Trondheim north to Kirkenes. NRK had to its disposition four 15-kHz mono analog program channels. The government accelerated construction of transmitters in 1966, and by 1971 seventy-nine {{percent of the population}} had access to television coverage. In 1970 the network consisted of 39 main television transmitters and 266 smaller transmitters and frequency converters. The FM network consisted of 36 main transmitters and 126 smaller transmitters and frequency converters. The investments cost NOK200 million—the increase caused by a combination of inflation and under-budgeting. The operational costs remained at the budgeted levels.|$|E
25|$|Construction of a {{television}} network started with a microwave radio relay in the super high frequency band. The backbone of the system was a two-way 960 telephone channel, a one-way television channel network and additional communications lines in a third channel in Southern Norway. These lines could be rerouted {{if one of the}} relay stations fell out. It was supplemented with a redundant 300 telephone channel network. The <b>relay</b> <b>network</b> largely used the same masts as were used for television transmission, which was why the Telegraphy Administration was chosen instead of NRK. The 1957 plan called for seventy to eighty percent of the population having television coverage within twelve years. This was budgeted to cost NOK70 million, consisting of 28 transmitters and 19 frequency converters. The FM network would be built in parallel, with 37 transmitters and 10 frequency converters.|$|E

30|$|The FSO <b>relaying</b> <b>networks</b> {{with single}} <b>relay</b> {{have been studied}} in the {{literature}} under various conditions [7, 8]. The outage performance of AF and DF FSO <b>relaying</b> <b>networks</b> over log-normal fading channels was studied in [7] assuming {{the presence of a}} direct link between the source and the destination.

The performance of FSO <b>relay</b> <b>networks</b> over Gamma-Gamma fading channels was studied in [8].

40|$|ABSTRACT- Multi-hop <b>relaying</b> in {{cellular}} <b>networks</b> {{can greatly}} increase capacity and performance by exploiting {{the best available}} links to a base station. We envision {{an environment in which}} <b>relay</b> <b>networks</b> are dynamically formed in different frequency bands in response to the degradation of network performance. Nodes experiencing poor service may use their agile radios to join one of the available, non-interfering <b>relay</b> <b>networks.</b> We propose and evaluate a set of algorithms used to form such <b>relay</b> <b>networks</b> on-demand. Each of the algorithms begins by designating the nodes best suited for acting as gateways between the <b>relay</b> and cellular <b>networks.</b> Each scheme then determines the order of route request initiations. These algorithms are evaluated for latency, signaling overhead and gateway load during the network formation process, and average path length and amount of link sharing in the resulting <b>relay</b> <b>networks.</b> The evaluation leads us to conclude that having nodes furthest from the BS initiate route discovery first is the best approach for reducing the formation overhead and building efficient <b>relay</b> <b>networks.</b> To our knowledge, we are the first to Mobile nodes in traditional wireless cellular networks communicate through centralized base stations (BS) in a predefine...|$|R

30|$|Most {{efforts that}} have been made for the {{utilization}} of adaptive transmission focus on traditional cooperative <b>relay</b> <b>networks</b> over Rayleigh or Nakagami-m fading channels. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no previous study considering adaptive transmission for MIMO AF <b>relay</b> <b>networks</b> with OSTBC transmission. Although OSTBC transmission provides diversity gain and decoding simplicity, it decreases transmission rate as compared to other kinds of space-time block codes (STBC). Therefore, it is beneficial to employ adaptive transmission schemes for MIMO AF <b>relay</b> <b>networks</b> with OSTBC transmission in order to enhance its spectral efficiency. In this article, we therefore analyze the performance of these systems over independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) and independent, non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) Nakagami-m fading channels. Our key contributions can be summarized as follows. We investigate the performance of MIMO CSI-assisted AF <b>relay</b> <b>networks</b> with OSTBC transmission for the adaptive schemes of OSPR, ORCP, and TCIFR over Nakagami-m fading channels. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for the channel capacity of the three adaptive MIMO AF <b>relay</b> <b>networks</b> with OSTBC based on the CHF of the reciprocal of the instantaneous SNR at the destination. Furthermore, we present expressions of the outage probability for the considered cooperative <b>relay</b> <b>networks</b> with OSPR and TCIFR wherein transmission will be suspended as long as the instantaneous SNR falls below an optimal value. For the ORCP scheme, however, {{there is no need to}} evaluate the outage probability as the source constantly keeps transmission regardless of the value of the instantaneous SNR.|$|R
