RIFM generates, evaluates and distributes scientific data on the safety assessment of fragrance raw materials found in personal and household care products. Through extensive research, testing and constant monitoring of all scientific literature available, RIFM maintains its Database as the most comprehensive source worldwide of physical-chemical, toxicological and eco-toxicological data associated with known fragrance and flavor materials. All of RIFM’s scientific findings are evaluated by an independent Expert Panel—an international group of dermatologists, pathologists, toxicologists, reproduction, respiratory and environmental scientists. The Expert Panel evaluates the safety of fragrance ingredients under conditions of intended use and publishes their results in peer-reviewed scientific journals.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{describes}} the local {{knowledge of the}} medicinal use of Stryphnodendron rotundifolium Mart., Fabaceae, according to informants in two areas of the Araripe bioregion, in the Northeast Region of Brazil. We used interviews to investigate the ethnomedicinal use of the local species to determine the mode of use, frequency of administration, duration of treatment and <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> In traditional medicine, the use of S. rotundifolium {{is associated with the}} treatment of inflammatory and infectious diseases. The part of the plant most used was the stem bark (86. 11 %), the predominant mode of preparation was immersion in water (52. 83 %), and oral administration was the most cited (48. 43 %). For inflammatory and infectious diseases, the treatment lasted 3 - 10 days and the frequency of administration was 2 - 3 times/day. For gastroprotective effects, treatment lasted up to 30 days, and the herb was administered 1 - 3 times/day. For pain complaints, the therapy varied from 2 - 3 days to continuous administration. The informants (46. 87 %) did not mention <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> except for pregnant women, with a rate of 25 %. A comparison of these results with the ethnopharmacological information from other studies showed that some of the traditional indications are scientifically supported by the literature or clinical studies. Nevertheless, the results showed that pharmacologists have not fully investigated all the possible bioactivities that healers credit to this plant...|$|E
40|$|The theory, use and {{limitations}} of classical potentials are presented, {{in the specific context}} of computational studies of materials. The general form of potentials is detailed, and several examples, used for educational purposes (Lennard-Jones) or giving good results for different kinds of materials (EAM, Stillinger-Weber, Tersoff), are described. Important issues related to classical potentials such as transferability, <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> and space and time limitations are also discussed. Three examples of theoretical studies, modeling of dislocations in zinc-blende materials, investigation of the dislocation formation from surface defects in a semiconductor, and study of the SiC/Si(001) interface, are presented.

40|$|Poor vision (in particular, reduced {{contrast}} sensitivity, depth {{perception and}} visual field size) reduces postural stability {{and increases the}} risk of falls and fractures in older people. Multifocal glasses may add to this risk by impairing distance contrast sensitivity and depth perception. Maximizing vision through cataract surgery and occupational therapy interventions involving home hazards reduction in visually impaired older people are effective strategies for fall prevention. Although interventions involving vision assessment and provision of new spectacles improve visual acuity in older people, this strategy may not reduce, and may even increase, the risk of falls. Further randomized, controlled trials are required to determine whether <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> multifocal glasses and multifaceted visual interventions can significantly reduce falls in older people. © 2008 Future Medicine Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The Cartesian {{feedback}} {{technique is}} an extended solution {{for reducing the}} distortions generated by the nonlinearities of power RF amplifiers, being its <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> related to the stability margins of the lineariser loop. Here, considerations are given to its use in the Ka-band, where the small wavelengths lead to critical times and phase unbalances which produce misadjustments of the feedback loop parameters. Results are obtained from the simulation of a Cartesian feedback lineariser applied to a commercial 28 GHz power amplifier. Introduction: Among the different linerisation techniques, Cartesian feedback, feedforward and predistortion are the most suitable for multilevel modulation, where class A or class AB power amplifiers are necessary. Other techniques, such as LINC [1], CALLUM [2] or Envelope Elimination and Restoration [3] are guided to higher-efficiency amplifiers used in modulations which produce smal...|$|E

40|$|This report, which {{relates the}} {{situation}} as of 15 August 1994, again confirms the internationally leading role of the Federal German Republic in the phase-out of CFCs. No country has realised a more comprehensive concept for the phase-out of substances that deplete the ozone layer. Combining statutory and voluntary measures has proved a path-breaking approach. One {{of the most important}} driving forces in the CFC phase-out were the <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> imposed by the Ordinance on the Prohibition of CFCs and Halon.

40|$|In hospitalized {{patients}} with severe infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas or staphylococci, {{there is a}} need for broad-spectrum antimicrobial chemotherapy. The choice of agents depends on the local spectrum of bacterial pathogens, their antimicrobial susceptibility, and the cost and availability of antibiotics. A combination of an aminoglycoside, most commonly gentamicin, and a yS-lactam is most often used. There is now a broader choice among new aminoglycosides, including tobramycin and amikacin. Differences in ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity have not been proved to be of clinical relevance. A consideration of the predictability of adequate, non-toxic serum levels, therapeutic ratio, susceptibility to inactivation by / 7 -lactam antibiotics, and susceptibility to aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, suggests that amikacin may be the drug of choice. There is no evidence that the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> amikacin, without <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> all aminoglycosides, will have any effect on the emergence of amikacin resistance. It also seems unlikely that third-generation cephalosporins will replace aminoglycosides. Thus amikacin seems likely t...|$|R
