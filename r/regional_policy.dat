Ecotourism poses an ideal solution, since {{it has the potential}} of bringing about the desired balance between socio-economic development and environmental protection. Specific objectives of ecotourism development include reviving traditional activities such as small-scale farming and stock-raising, as well as establishing a network of communities of chamois biotopes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the <b>regional</b> <b>policy</b> of {{bringing}} businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E

We argue that diminishing inter-regional inequality may have an undesirable impact on inequalities between workers and capital owners in the rich region. We also analyze the short-term demand and the long term supply effects of <b>regional</b> <b>policies.</b> Finally, we argue that due to non linear effects, <b>regional</b> <b>policies</b> may be useless most of the time and very powerful in particular circumstances. ...|$|R

25|$|All {{the accusations}} of gerrymandering, {{practically}} all the complaints about housing and <b>regional</b> <b>policy,</b> and a disproportionate {{amount of the}} charges about public and private employment come from this area. The area – which consisted of Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh, Londonderry County Borough, and portions of Counties Londonderry and Armagh – had {{less than a quarter}} of the total population of Northern Ireland yet generated not far short of three-quarters of the complaints of discrimination...The unionist government must bear its share of responsibility. It put through the original gerrymander which underpinned so many of the subsequent malpractices, and then, despite repeated protests, did nothing to stop those malpractices continuing. The most serious charge against the Northern Ireland government is not that it was directly responsible for widespread discrimination, but that it allowed discrimination on such a scale over a substantial segment of Northern Ireland.|$|E

The Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei directly chooses the ministries of Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs, as well as certain other ministries, such as the Science Ministry. Iran’s <b>regional</b> <b>policy</b> is directly controlled by the office of the Supreme Leader with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ task limited to protocol and ceremonial occasions.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to provide a reply to the following question: What is the most suitable way of tackling evaluation of new <b>regional</b> <b>policies?</b> <b>Regional</b> development has moved today to new arenas. Here, we are discussing learning communities and regions that are able to adapt themselves to the new competitive conditions. SMEs <b>policies</b> at the <b>regional</b> level have also changed. New <b>regional</b> <b>policies</b> devote much of their attention to networks of inter-rm and inter-institutional cooperation—clusters—and to regional innovation systems. As a consequence, evaluation methodologies are also changing looking for more creative ways of assessing the impact of these new policies. In our opinion, participatory evaluation seems to be more appropriate to the specic characteristics of new <b>regional</b> <b>policies</b> and more suitable for sorting out the problems posed by their evaluation. In addition, under this approach, evaluation can turn into a useful tool to mobilize communities for regional action, empower local agents and enhance learning capacity. 1...|$|R
40|$|Central {{and local}} governments of Japan have made efforts to {{invigorate}} the regional economies {{for more than half}} a century, but the goal has not yet been achieved. People who have been directly or indirectly involved with regional polices indicated that problems were encountered during the process of making and executing <b>regional</b> <b>policies.</b> The problems can be attributed to the following three points: There has not been enough coordination among <b>regional</b> <b>policies.</b> Almost all of the <b>regional</b> <b>policies</b> have been formulated by the central government. There has not been enough cooperation in the regional areas. After analyzing some of the above cases and considering the economic theory, we conclude that the aforementioned three points are appropriate. We also discuss the necessity of forming a new regional system that fosters more decentralized regional economies and brings about sustainable economic growth in such regions. ...|$|R
500|$|Far more {{important}} than creating Europe's first social and <b>regional</b> <b>policy,</b> {{it is argued that}} the ECSC introduced European peace. It involved the continent's first European tax. This was a flat tax, a levy on production with a maximum rate of one percent. Given that the European Community countries are now experiencing the longest period of peace in more than seventy years, this has been described as the cheapest tax for peace in history. Another world war, or [...] "world suicide" [...] as Schuman called this threat in 1949, was avoided. In October 1953 Schuman said that the possibility of another European war had been eliminated.

The plan included a commuter rail line on the BNSF Scenic Subdivision between Everett, Mukilteo, Edmonds and King Street Station in Seattle, a light rail line from Lynnwood to Seattle following Interstate 5, and express bus service to light rail stations. The following November, the smaller [...] "Sound Move" [...] plan was approved at a cost of $3.9 billion (equivalent to $ in [...] ), including commuter rail from Everett to Seattle and express buses on Interstate 5 from Everett and Lynnwood to Seattle and Bellevue.|$|E
