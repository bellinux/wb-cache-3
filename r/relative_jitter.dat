30|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{evaluation}} of different methods to estimate the amount of jitter present in speech signals. The jitter value {{is a measure of the}} irregularity of a quasiperiodic signal and is a good indicator of the presence of pathologies in the larynx such as vocal fold nodules or a vocal fold polyp. Given the irregular nature of the speech signal, each jitter estimation algorithm relies on its own model making a direct comparison of the results very difficult. For this reason, the evaluation of the different jitter estimation methods was target on their ability to detect pathological voices. Two databases were used for this evaluation: a subset of the MEEI database and a smaller database acquired in the scope of this work. The results showed that there were significant differences in the performance of the algorithms being evaluated. Surprisingly, in the largest database the best results were not achieved with the commonly used <b>relative</b> <b>jitter,</b> measured as a percentage of the glottal cycle, but with absolute jitter values measured in microseconds. Also, the new proposed measure for jitter, LocJitt, performed in general is equal to or better than the commonly used tools of MDVP and Praat.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} technique, {{to be used}} for time-resolved pump-probe experiments, for timing an x-ray free {{electron}} laser (XFEL) to a high-power conventional laser with femtosecond accuracy. Our method takes advantage of the same electron bunch to produce both an XFEL pulse and an ultrashort optical pulse {{with the help of an}} optical radiator downstream of the x-ray undulator. Since both pulses are produced by the same electron bunch, they are perfectly synchronized. Application of cross-correlation techniques will allow to determine <b>relative</b> <b>jitter</b> between the optical pulse (and, thus, the XFEL pulse) and a pulse from an external pump-laser with femtosecond resolution. Technical realization of the proposed timing scheme uses an optical replica synthesizer (ORS) setup to be installed after the final bunch-compression stage of the XFEL. The electron bunch is modulated in the ORS setup by an external optical laser. Subsequently, it travels through the main undulator, and produces the XFEL pulse. Finally, a powerful optical pulse of coherent edge radiation is generated as the bunch passes through a long straight section and a separation magnet downstream of the main undulator. Our study shows that at a moderate (about 10 %) density modulation of the electron bunch at the location of the optical radiator allows production of high power x-ray and optical pulses. Relative synchronization of these pulses is preserved by using the same mechanical support for both x-ray and optical elements transporting radiation down to the experimental area, where single-shot cross-correlation between optical pulse and pump-laser pulse is performed. We illustrate the potential of the proposed timing technique with numerical examples referring to the European XFEL facility.

40|$|Abstract: In {{real-time}} control system, output jitter of a task {{is important}} when feedback control loops are implemented as execution of periodic tasks.

While the transverse jitter of the beam is about 10 - 20 % of the rms beam sizes, the jitter in the longitudinal phase space is a multiple of the energy spread and bunch length.

To investigate how the local circuitry provides for these activities, we applied resampled cross-correlation analyses to large-scale recordings of neuronal {{populations in the}} cornu ammonis 1 (CA 1) and CA 3 regions of the hippocampus of freely moving rats. Significant counts in the cross-correlation of cell pairs, <b>relative</b> to <b>jittered</b> surrogate spike-trains, allowedus to identify the effective couplingsbetweenneurons inCA 1 andCA 3 hippocampal regionson the timescale of milliseconds. In addition to putative excitatory and inhibitory monosynaptic connections, we uncovered prominent milli-second timescale synchrony between cell pairs, observed as peaks in the central 0 ms bin of cross-correlograms. This millisecond timescale synchrony appeared to be independent of network state, excitatory input, and oscillations. Moreover, it was frequently observed between cells of differing putative interneuronal type, arguing against gap junctions as the sole underlying source. Our obser-vations corroborate recent in vitro findings suggesting that inhibition alone is sufficient to synchronize interneurons at such fast time-scales. Moreover, we show that this synchronous spikingmay cause stronger inhibition and rebound spiking in target neurons, pointing toward a potential function for millisecond synchrony of interneurons in shaping and affecting timing in pyramidal populations within and downstream from the circuit.

40|$|Model-based {{studies of}} {{auditory}} nerve responses to electrical stimulation can {{provide insight into}} the functioning of cochlear implants. Ideally, these studies can identify limitations in sound processing strategies and lead to improved methods for providing sound information to cochlear implant users. To accomplish this, models must accurately describe auditory nerve spiking while avoiding excessive complexity that would preclude large-scale simulations of populations of auditory nerve fibers and obscure insight into the mechanisms that influence neural encoding of sound information. In this spirit, we develop a point process model of the auditory nerve that provides a compact and accurate description of neural responses to electric stimulation. Inspired by the framework of generalized linear models, the proposed model consists of a cascade of linear and nonlinear stages. We show how each of these stages can be associated with biophysical mechanisms and related to models of neuronal dynamics. Moreover, we derive a semi-analytical procedure that uniquely determines each parameter in the model on the basis of fundamental statistics from recordings of single fiber responses to electric stimulation, including threshold, <b>relative</b> spread, <b>jitter,</b> and chronaxie. The model also accounts for refractory and summation effects that influence the responses of auditory nerve fibers to high pulse rate stimulation. Throughout, we compare model predictions to published physiological data and explain differences in auditory nerve responses to high and low pulse rate stimulation.

It {{has been previously}} established that the electrode position can influence CI performance. Thus, electrode position {{should be considered in}} order to achieve better CI results. This paper describes how the electrode position influences the auditory nerve fiber (ANF) response to either a single pulse or low- (250 pulses/s) and high-rate (5, 000 pulses/s) pulse-trains using a computational model. The field potential in the cochlea was calculated using a three-dimensional finite-element model, and the ANF response was simulated using a biophysical ANF model. The effects were evaluated in terms of the dynamic range, stochasticity, and spike excitation pattern. The <b>relative</b> spread, threshold, <b>jitter,</b> and initiated node were analyzed for single-pulse response; and the dynamic range, threshold, initiated node, and interspike interval were analyzed for pulse-train stimuli responses. Electrode position was found to significantly affect the spatiotemporal pattern of the ANF response, and this effect was significantly dependent on the stimulus rate.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that neonatal deafness of 7 - 13 months duration leads to loss of cochleotopy {{in the primary}} auditory cortex (AI) that can be reversed by cochlear implant use. Here we describe {{the effects of a}} similar duration of deafness and cochlear implant use on temporal processing. Specifically, we compared the temporal resolution of neurons in AI of young adult normal-hearing cats that were acutely deafened and implanted immediately prior to recording with that in three groups of neonatally deafened cats. One group of neonatally deafened cats received no chronic stimulation. The other two groups received up to 8 months of either low- or high-rate (50 or 500 pulses per second per electrode, respectively) stimulation from a clinical cochlear implant, initiated at 10 weeks of age. Deafness of 7 - 13 months duration had no effect on the duration of post-onset response suppression, latency, latency jitter, or the stimulus repetition rate at which units responded maximally (best repetition rate), but resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the ability of units to respond to every stimulus in a train (maximum following rate). None of the temporal response characteristics of the low-rate group differed from those in acutely deafened controls. In contrast, high-rate stimulation had diverse effects: it resulted in decreased suppression duration, longer latency and greater <b>jitter</b> <b>relative</b> to all other groups, and an increase in best repetition rate and cut-off rate relative to acutely deafened controls. The minimal effects of moderate-duration deafness on temporal processing in the present study are in contrast to its previously-reported pronounced effects on cochleotopy. Much longer periods of deafness have been reported to result in significant changes in temporal processing, in accord with the fact that duration of deafness is a major factor influencing outcome in human cochlear implantees.

40|$|Advanced accelerators {{have great}} promise in {{reducing}} the size and cost of high energy colliders as well as bringing high brightness x-ray sources to the laboratory tabletop scale. The inverse free electron laser (IFEL) is a high gradient advanced accelerator scheme {{that is one of}} the most ecient ways of transferring energy from a laser to an electron beam. By copropagating a laser and a relativisticelectron beam through an undulator in vacuum and taking advantage of resonant ponderomotive motion of the electron beam, IFEL avoids the breakdown associated with other schemes that use a material to couple the laser fields to the electron beams. This dissertation provides an overview of IFEL, the photoinjector electron beams to be used in IFEL interactions, and two IFEL applications: compression and synchronization of a photoinjector electron beam to a laser application using THz driven IFEL and high gradient acceleration using IFEL. The numerically investigated THz IFEL application shows that with a 10 J THz 8 pulse train, an electron beam bunch length of 100 fs RMS can be compressed to 14 fs RMS and have the beam's time of arrival <b>jitter</b> <b>relative</b> to an external laser reduced by an order of magnitude. High gradient acceleration by IFEL was examined experimentally at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). This experiment marks the first attempt to use sub-picosecond time pulse, TW peak power scale titanium:sapphire laser pulses to perform IFEL acceleration. The demonstrated energy gain from 77 to 120 MeV combined with particle tracking simulations shows an acceleratinggradient of over 200 MeV/m. Because the laser pulse length is the same order as the slippage experienced by the electron beam with respect to the laser and the time of arrival jitter has been measured to be greater than 2 ps, the overlap is investigated through relative single shot time of arrival measurements using electro-optic sampling based spatial encoding techniques. The temporal overlapmeasurement was found to be consistent with a cross-correlation model taking into account the independently measured laser and electron beam lengths...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a {{different}} method for creating acoustic pulses {{that can be}} used in the ultrasonic spectrum is proposed. The aim is to develop a robust and reliable system that uses ultrasonic techniques, such as transit time or sing-around, to measure gas flows in extreme environments. Extreme environments involve high temperatures, contaminating dust and sometimes high moisture content. The investigated method in this work utilizes electric spark discharges to generate acoustic pulses. Studies of the gap discharge acoustic emitter were performed in two parts: environmental tests and studies of the transmitted sound. Environmental tests were performed at industrial sites to test the gap discharge emitter when exposed to heavy surface contamination and moderate temperatures. Studies of the transmitted sound were performedwith a primary focus on the time stability of the emitted sound. Due to the nature of the spark discharge phenomena, there are inconsistencies in the transmitted acoustic pulse. When pulses are transmitted and received consecutively, their measured travel times will contain a time <b>jitter</b> <b>relative</b> to each other. This jitter is investigated and put into the perspective of a gas flow measurement situation. Acoustic pulses from the gas discharge emitter are shown to be strong enough to be used in large geometries of several meters. Additionally tests were performed in the industrial environments to determine if the acoustic pulses can be sent through large gas flow ducts and detected at the oppositeside. The tests show that the gap discharge transducer at the prototype stage performs well in a real industrial environment. The emitter continues to work when subjected to heavy contamination. The emitted sound is loud enough to be detected using standard piezo ceramic ultrasonic transducers when sent through large gas flows (air). If used in measurement situations that involve acoustic travel paths longer than around 1. 5 meters and gas flows in the range of a few m/s or larger, this emitter can deliver sufficient accuracy.
