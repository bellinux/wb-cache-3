5|$|As part of {{the first}} {{amendment}} to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new <b>reserve</b> <b>instrument</b> called special drawing rights (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion XDR from 1970 to 1972.|$|E
5|$|IMF members {{signed the}} Jamaica Agreement in January 1976, which {{ratified}} {{the end of}} the Bretton Woods system and reoriented the Fund's role in supporting the international monetary system. The agreement officially embraced the flexible exchange rate regimes that emerged after the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement measures. In tandem with floating exchange rates, the agreement endorsed central bank interventions aimed at clearing excessive volatility. The agreement retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a <b>reserve</b> <b>instrument</b> and the Fund subsequently demonetized its gold reserves, returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding. Developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed greater access to IMF lending programs as a result. The Fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises, but began imposing conditionality on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases, reducing protective trade barriers, and contractionary monetary policy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{conducts a}} {{theoretical}} {{comparison of the}} potential effectiveness, in terms of money stock controllability, of interest rate and reserve instruments. Whereas previous studies have been basically static, the present analysis is {{carried out in the}} context of a dynamic macroeconomic model with rational expectations. Particular attention is paid to the distinction between contemporaneous and lagged reserve accounting (CRA and LRA). The criterion employed is the expectation of squared deviations of the (log of the) money stock from target values that are reset each period. Analysis in the basic model suggests the following substantive conclusions. (1) With a <b>reserve</b> <b>instrument,</b> monetary control will be more effective under CRA than LRA. (2) With a <b>reserve</b> <b>instrument</b> and LRA, control will be poorer than with an interest rate instrument. (3) For a wide range of parameter values, control will be better with a <b>reserve</b> <b>instrument</b> and CRA than with an interest rate instrument. ...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this dissertation was to increase scientific understanding of brain reserve. Chapter 1 describes how brain reserve {{has come to be}} viewed in two distinct ways: differential expression of brain injury on the basis of individual differences in gross brain properties (neurological), or on the basis of lifespan patterns of complex mental activity (behavioural). Evidence in the Alzheimer’s disease and ageing literature has been extensive, yet with conflicting reports. In order to better evaluate this evidence, a systematic review of cohort studies is the focus of Chapter 2. Complex mental activity was found to be associated with reduced incidence of dementia and slowed rate of cognitive decline. Neurological brain reserve evidence was limited. A major task of this dissertation was to develop a more standard and complete behavioural brain <b>reserve</b> <b>instrument.</b> Chapter 3 relates the development of the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) in a group of 86 healthy elderly. The LEQ had adequate levels of internal consistency and reliability. In a validation test, higher LEQ scores were also found to predict attenuated cognitive decline over 18 months independent of covariates including premorbid IQ. Chapter 4 describes how both LEQ (as a measure of behavioural brain reserve) and intracranial volume (as a measure of neurological brain reserve) significantly predicted cognitive decline over three years in a sample of 70 aged subjects. Total LEQ was furthermore significantly correlated with hippocampal volume independent of intracranial volume, and this association mediated the relationship with cognitive decline. Behavioural brain reserve may therefore work by protecting individuals from hippocampal atrophy. The fifth chapter explores therapeutic and neurobiological aspects of behavioural brain reserve in a preliminary fashion. A randomized-control mental activity trial was run with 20 healthy elderly who received repeat magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mental activity subjects were found to have selective and sustained upregulation of phosphocreatine metabolism in the hippocampal region, a finding of potential neuroprotective significance. Experience-dependent neuroplasticity is proposed as a unifying framework in the final chapter, allowing synthesis of the present findings and reconciliation of the neurological and behavioural approaches to brain reserve...|$|E

40|$|Using {{a dynamic}} {{stochastic}} {{general equilibrium model}} with financial frictions, this paper evaluates {{the effects of a}} rule that incorporates not only the interest rate but also the legal <b>reserve</b> requirements as <b>instruments</b> of monetary policy. It is found that reserve requirements can be used to achieve the Central Bank's inflation objectives. The use of this instrument, however, produces a real appreciation of the Uruguayan peso. When the Central Bank uses the monetary policy rate as an instrument, the effect of an increase in reserve requirements is to contribute to reducing the negative impact on consumption, investment and output. Nevertheless, the quantitative results in terms of inflation reduction are rather poor. The policy rate becomes more effective in reducing inflation when the <b>reserve</b> requirement <b>instrument</b> is solely directed at achieving financial stability. The paper's main policy conclusion is that a well-targeted non-conventional policy instrument can help to effectively control inflation. ...|$|R

Much of the reserve increase in Asia can be explained by an optimal insurance model under which reserves provide a steady source of liquidity to cushion the impact of a sudden stop in capital inflows on output and consumption. Moreover, the benefits of reserves in terms of reduced spreads on privately held external debt further explains the observed growth in reserves since 1997 - 98. Using threshold estimation techniques, the paper shows that most of Asia can still benefit from higher reserves in terms of reduced borrowing costs.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{has led to}} the development of an active debate on the use of macro-prudential instruments for regulating the banking system, in particular for liquidity and capital holdings. Within the context of a micro-founded macroeconomic model, we allow commercial banks to choose their optimal mix of asset creation, apportioning this to either reserves or private sector loans. We examine the implications for quantities, relative non-financial and financial prices from standard macroeconomic shocks alongside shocks to the expected liquidity of banks and to the efficiency of the banking sector. We focus on the response by the monetary sector, in particular the optimal reserve-deposit ratio adopted by commercial banks. Overall we find some rationale for Basel III in providing commercial banks with an incentive to hold liquid assets, such as reserves, as this acts to limit the procyclicality of lending to the private sector.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a robust but previously undocumented data pattern: corporate risk taking is {{positively correlated with}} country-level foreign exchange reserve holdings (as {{a share of the}} GDP). With data on 5000 manufacturing firms in 24 emerging economies during 2000 - 2006, we show that foreign reserve accumulation is economically and statistically associated with higher leverage ratios, lower cash holdings, riskier investments, and higher total and idiosyncratic stock return volatilities. We further show that at least a part of the positive correlation is due to greater corporate risk taking in response to an improvement in a country’s ability to defend against macroeconomic risks associated with a sudden stop in international capital flows. The pattern is stronger for firms that are intrinsically more dependent on external finance for working capital and capital expenditure. It continues to hold when the foreign <b>reserve</b> is <b>instrumented</b> by cumulative trade surpluses.
