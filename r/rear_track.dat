Induction improvements include larger valves and a downdraught carburettor. The front and <b>rear</b> <b>tracks</b> are now the same—4 ft and the wheelbase of all cars is now 7 ft.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, {{the second}} {{generation}} of the Eurovans was launched. The 807 itself was launched in June, followed by the C8 in July. The floorpan, wheelbase, and postponement were not transformed, but all exterior dimensions, including front and <b>rear</b> <b>tracks,</b> were increased. The increase in length of almost 30 cm greatly enhanced interior volume. The new Eurovans were afforded a much more bubbly, contemporary look, along with a modern looking dashboard with centrally mounted gauges.|$|R
2500|$|Commencing around July 1956, in a {{back room}} at the Meadows factory, a {{prototype}} vehicle, nicknamed The Bug was constructed and developed. This small, four-wheeled, two-seater, utilized a moulded fibreglass shell with gull-wing doors and a Villiers air-cooled [...] two-cylinder engine fitted to a brazed ladder-type chassis. To make a differential unnecessary, the car used a very narrow <b>rear</b> <b>track,</b> with drive to the solid rear axle by roller chain. The car was fitted with a four-speed motorcycle manual gearbox, with reverse obtained by running the engine backwards through the Dynastart unit.|$|E
2500|$|The 1960 models saw a {{complete}} re-skinning {{with the exception}} of the body's canopies which remained identical to the 59's, but removed the tail fins and the distinctive split grille (which Ford copied on the final Edsel models for 1960). The 1960 models standard engine all had a Horsepower gain of 3hp due to a compression bump of [...]25 to one over the 59 engine. The front track was now widened to the <b>rear</b> <b>track</b> at 64". Ventura was introduced, a more luxurious hardtop coupe and the Vista 4-door hardtop now being built on the shorter [...] wheelbase platform, with it falling between the Catalina and Star Chief models. The Ventura featured the luxury features of the Bonneville in the shorter, lighter Catalina body.|$|E
2500|$|BMW {{knew that}} it needed a four-seat family car {{to keep up with}} the rising wealth and {{expectations}} of the German people, but it could not access funding to develop a new car for this market. They therefore developed the 600, a four-seat car based on the Isetta. [...] The 600 used the front suspension, the front seats, and the front-mounted door from the Isetta, but used a new, longer ladder frame with a longer, four-seat body, a rear-mounted 0.6L flat-twin motorcycle engine, and a full-width <b>rear</b> <b>track.</b> [...] The 600's rear suspension was BMW's first use of the semi-trailing arm system that would be used on their sedans and coupes until the 1990s. [...] Released in 1957, the 600 could not compete against the larger, more powerful Volkswagen Beetle. [...] Production ended in 1959 after fewer than 35,000 were built.|$|E
50|$|An early {{example of}} a snow coach was the Snow Bus, built by Bombardier in Canada. It was {{equipped}} with front skis and <b>rear</b> <b>tracks</b> and typically could seat 12 passengers. Alternatively, the front skis could be removed and replaced with front wheels. There are documented uses of the Bombardier Snow Bus {{being used as a}} school bus, for mail delivery and as emergency vehicles, but they were also used for tours and transportation in snowbound areas.|$|R
5000|$|Fiat-Abarth OT 2000 Coupe America: {{introduced}} in February 1966, {{it was based}} on the 850 Coupé but powered by a two-litre engine. It differed visually from the 850 Coupé in having a barred grill between the headlights, a split front bumper flanking a spare wheel which projected forward below the grille, widened front and <b>rear</b> <b>tracks</b> and wings, and a vented front bonnet. The 1,946 cc twin cam four-cylinder produced [...] and could propel the car to 240 km/h. Three examples were produced.|$|R
5000|$|In 1915 Ray H. Muscott of Waters, Michigan, {{received}} the Canadian patent for his motor sleigh, or [...] "traineau automobile", and on June 27, 1916, he {{received the}} first United States patent for a snow-vehicle using the now recognized format of <b>rear</b> <b>track(s)</b> and front skis. Many individuals later modified Ford Model Ts with the undercarriage replaced by tracks and skis following this design. They were popular for rural mail delivery for a time. The common name for these conversion of cars and small trucks was Snowflyers.|$|R
2500|$|The GTO {{became a}} {{separate}} Pontiac model (model number 242) in 1966, {{instead of being}} an [...] "option package" [...] on the Tempest LeMans. The entire GM [...] "A" [...] body intermediate line was restyled that year, gaining more curvaceous styling with kicked-up rear fender lines for a [...] "Coke-bottle" [...] look, and a slightly [...] "tunneled" [...] backlight. The tail light featured a rare louvered cover, only seen on the GTO. Overall length grew only fractionally, to , still on a [...] wheelbase, while width expanded to [...] <b>Rear</b> <b>track</b> increased one inch (2.5cm). Overall weight remained about the same. The GTO was available as a pillared coupe, a hardtop (without B-pillars), and a convertible. Also an automotive industry first, plastic front grilles replaced the pot metal and aluminum versions seen on earlier years. New Strato bucket seats were introduced with higher and thinner seat backs and contoured cushions for added comfort and adjustable headrests were introduced as a new option. The instrument panel was redesigned and more integrated than in previous years with the ignition switch moved from the far left of the dash {{to the right of}} the steering wheel. Four pod instruments continued, and the GTO's dash was highlighted by walnut veneer trim.|$|E
2500|$|The Chieftain {{line was}} renamed Catalina; Star Chief was {{downgraded}} {{to replace the}} discontinued Super Chief series {{and for the first}} time did not have a two-door hardtop, only a two-door sedan along with a four-door hardtop and four-door sedan, in addition there was no Star Chief wagon. The Bonneville was now the top of the line, coming in three body styles of two-door hardtop, four-door vista and four-door wagon. The Star Chief's four-door [...] "Vista" [...] hardtop was also shared by the Bonneville. Catalina models included a two-door hardtop, two-door sedan, four-door sedan, four-door hardtop vista and two wagons, one a six-passenger and one a nine-passenger wagon. Bonneville and Star Chief were built on a [...] wheelbase with the exception of the Bonneville wagon and all Catalina models and Bonneville wagon that rode on a 122-inch wheelbase. Catalina was also seven inches shorter than Bonneville and Star Chief and weighed one hundred to two hundred pounds less than its long-wheelbase counterparts. All 1959 Pontiac engines were equipped with a 389-cubic-inch engine with horsepower ratings from 215Hp economy engine to a conservative rated 345hp Tri power carbureted engine. All automatics were four-speed Super-Hydra-Matics or, as Hydramatic Division who designed and built them called them, [...] "Controlled coupling HydraMatic". A special note here is that Oldsmobile used this same transmission and called it Jetaway HydraMatic and Cadillac also used this transmission and Cadillac called it 315 or P 315 Hydramatic. A three-speed column-mounted stick shift was standard on all Pontiacs. This coincided with major body styling changes across all models that introduced increased glass area, twin V-shaped fins and lower hood profiles. Because of these changes, Motor Trend magazine picked the entire Pontiac line as 1959 Car of the Year. The '59s have a five-inch (127mm) wider track, Front at 63 7/8" [...] front track and 64.0" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>track</b> because Knudsen noticed the new, wider bodies looked awkward on the carried-over 1958 frames. The new [...] "Wide-Track" [...] Pontiacs not only had improved styling, but also handled better—a bonus that tied into Pontiac's resurgence in the marketplace.|$|E

500|$|The chassis {{was based}} on a pressed steel ladder frame with channel-section side members and {{fabricated}} and tubular cross members. Suspension was by semi-elliptic leaf springs and Watson Stabilator dampers front and rear, with a tubular beam axle at the front and a live axle and radius rods at the rear. The standard wheelbase was , [...] with a wheelbase of [...] available for seven-passenger bodies. The front and <b>rear</b> <b>tracks</b> were both [...] wide.

5000|$|The {{vehicle is}} formed by two rubber Kegresse track units with a {{multi-directional}} pivot in between. The front unit contains {{the engine and}} gearbox through which power is delivered to the front and, via a propshaft in the pivot mechanism, the <b>rear</b> <b>tracks.</b> A hydraulic ram on the pivot [...] "bends" [...] the vehicle in the middle to steer it—there is no braking of track units for steering as on conventional tracklaying vehicles. The controls are a conventional steering wheel on the left hand front of the vehicle. It can reach a speed of 35 km/h on land and 7 km/h (4 kn) on water.|$|R

50|$|Thunderbolt {{production}} was ended due to NHRA rule changes for Super Stock competition, requiring that 500 vehicles be built to be entered in that class. Ford had been losing $1500 to $2000 on each Thunderbolt {{sold at the}} sticker price of $3900. The first 11 Thunderbolts were painted maroon (known as Vintage Burgundy in Ford literature), the rest white; 99 had manual transmissions. Many are still raced. About 50 similar Mercury Cyclones were also produced by Ford in 1964, destined to be modified to represent Ford in A/FX competition, which they dominated, as well. These vehicles varied greatly in wheel track due to customer options for varying suspension and wheel/tire combinations. Front tracks from 54 to 56 in and <b>rear</b> <b>tracks</b> from 53.5 to 55.5 in were common.|$|R
50|$|The {{driver and}} {{powerpack}} {{are at the}} front of the hull with a fully enclosed turret at the rear.
