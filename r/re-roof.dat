It split {{from end to end}} and a couple of sheets immediately blew off the roof.They spent the afternoon cutting trees in the scrub and trimming them for rafters, though nothing had been farther from Henrys intention and inclination. He cut down a few little trees while Pietro cut a lot of big ones. Pietro always took the heavier end when they loaded the rails, but even so, Henry became exhausted. Round about four oclock he decided to go home."Sufficient", he said.Pietro consulted a diagram he had made."No sufficient", he said. [...] "Ancora four."... They finished re-roofing the shed by the week-end. Pietro wanted to know if they would cut some fence-posts next week to repair the fences.

5000|$|Around 1930 Mille Smith Eastman became rather {{interested}} in Scouting. Her interest in Scouting {{continued to grow}} with each succeeding year, and in July 1930 she bought an additional 15 acre for the camp from Mr. Roy W. Pilkington. All the other tracts of land composing the camp site have been conveyed by straight warranty deeds and carry no burden. A holding company composed of nine directors was incorporated under {{the laws of the}} State of Illinois, on the May 25, 1931, as a non-profit corporation for the purpose of holding the lands and properties of the camp. Said company {{to be known as the}} Boy Scout Camp Corporation with its Illinois headquarters located at Hamilton, Illinois. The Rotary Club, up to this point had invested $3,223.80 on land, buildings and equipment. All of this was transferred to the Boy Scouts of America on December 21, 1931, and the camp’s name was changed to in July 1930. Mrs. Eastman continued to purchase and add additional tracts to the camp. On December 3, 1936, she bought a tract that gave the camp an unbroken shoreline of 7250 ft and a total of 137½ acres of land for the camp. In 1934 Mrs. Eastman began construction on a stone lodge in memory of her husband. She spread the mortar herself and laid the cornerstone in 1935. In 1942 construction took place for a home for the camp ranger. And In 1943 she provided a concrete block building; half to be used for recreation and a canteen and the other half for storage, nicknamed the Bee Hive. The Order of Eagles contributed $800.00 to build four sleeping cabins and later on in 1943, they gave an additional sum to <b>re-roof</b> and refit these buildings.

50|$|Two {{people stand}} out in Ely Cathedral's eighteenth century history, one a minor canon and the other an {{architectural}} contractor. James Bentham (1709 - 1794), building {{on the work of}} his father Rev. Samuel Bentham, studied the history of both the institution and architecture of the cathedral, culminating in 1771 with his publication of The History and Antiquities of the Conventual and Cathedral Church of Ely. He sought out original documents to provide definitive biographical lists of abbots, priors, deans and bishops, alongside a history of the abbey and cathedral, and was able to set out the architectural development of the building with detailed engravings and plans. These plans, elevations and sections had been surveyed by the architect James Essex (1722-1784), who by this means was able to both highlight the poor state of parts of the building, and understand its complex interdependencies. The level of expertise that Bentham and Essex brought to the situation enabled a well-prioritised series of repairs and sensitive improvements to be proposed that occupied much of the later eighteenth century. Essex identified the decay of the octagon lantern as the starting point of a major series of repairs, and was appointed in 1757 to oversee the work. 400 years of weathering and decay may have removed many of the gothic features, and shortage of funds allied to a Georgian suspicion of ornament resulted in plain and pared down timber and leadwork on the lantern. He was then able to move on to <b>re-roof</b> the entire eastern arm and restore the eastern gable which had been pushed outwards some 2 ft. Bentham and Essex were both enthusiastic proponents of a longstanding plan to relocate the 14th century choir stalls from under the octagon. With the octagon and east roof dealt with, the scheme was embarked on in 1769, with Bentham, still only a minor canon, appointed as clerk of works. By moving the choir stalls to the far east end of the cathedral, the octagon became a spacious and dramatic public area for the first time, with grand vistas to east and west and spectacular views of the octagon vaulting. They also removed the Romanesque pulpitum and put in a new choir screen two bays east of the octagon, surmounted by the 1690s organ case. Despite their antiquarian interests, Bentham and Essex appear to have dismantled the choir stalls with alarming lack of care, and saw no problem in clearing away features at the east end, and removing the pulpitum and medieval walls surrounding the choir stalls. The north wall turned out to incorporate the bones of seven 'Saxon worthies' which would have featured on the pilgrim route into the pre-reformation cathedral. The bones were rehoused in Bishop West's Chapel. The choir stalls, with their misericords were however retained, and the restoration as a whole was relatively sympathetic {{by the standards of the}} period.|$|E
