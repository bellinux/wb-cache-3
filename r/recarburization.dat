40|$|The article {{presents}} the factors affecting the carburizing rates obtained (rate and efficiency) {{during the process}} of melting cast iron. The analysis includes the recarburizer type (anthracite, natural and synthetic graphite, petroleum coke) and particle size. Further factors considered in work are the methods of <b>recarburization</b> (recarburizer introduction to a solid charge and {{on the surface of the}} metal bath) and the parameters of the melt (temperature and chemical composition). The analysis was based on experiments performed, the calculation results of computer simulations and literature data...|$|E
40|$|The {{issues of}} {{synthetic}} cast iron production on the steel scrap basis {{were presented in}} the paper. The steel scrap volume increase in solidcharge is undoubtedly beneficial from the environmental point of view {{because it is a}} waste material. The pig iron amount decrease oreven its complete elimination from the solid charge allows the pollution from its production decrease. However, when the synthetic cast iron is produced the problem of proper carbon content appears. Therefore in the paper the <b>recarburization</b> methods and carburizers used in foundry industry were presented. The analysis covers some issues of pollution in pig iron production process, blast-furnace coke and carburizers...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactions}} of both thiophene and H 2 S onMo(2) C/Al 2 O 3 catalyst {{have been studied}} by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy. CO adsorption was used to probe the surface sites of Mo 2 C/Al 2 O 3 catalyst under the interaction and reaction of thiophene and H 2 S. When the fresh Mo 2 C/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is treated with a thiophene/H- 2 mixture above 473 K, hydrogenated species exhibiting IR bands in the regions 2800 - 3000 cm(- 1) are produced on the surface, indicating that thiophene reacts with the fresh carbide catalyst at relatively low temperatures. IR spectra of adsorbed CO on fresh Mo 2 C/Al 2 O 3 pretreated by thiophene/H- 2 at different temperatures clearly reveal the gradual sulfidation of the carbide catalyst at temperatures higher than 473 K, while H 2 S/H- 2 can sulfide the Mo 2 C/Al 2 O 3 catalyst surface readily at room temperature (RT). The sulfidation of the carbide surface by the reaction with thiophene or H 2 S maybe the major cause of the deactivation of carbide catalysts in hydrotreating reactions. The surface of the sulfided carbide catalyst can be only partially regenerated by a <b>recarburization</b> using CH 4 /H- 2 at 1033 K. When the catalyst is first oxidized and then recarburized, the carbide surface can be completely reproduced...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{pneumatic}} powder injection into liquid alloys {{is known}} since many years. It is use in many metallurgical processes (<b>recarburization,</b> alloy additions introduction, desulphurization etc.). The problem {{in some cases}} is to prevent the carrier gas introduction into liquid bath. Design/methodology/approach: The objectives were achieved by researches with laboratory injection stand. The main research method was measurement of stream parameters and computation of pneumatic injection indexes. Findings: The new injection lance was invented and analyzed {{and this is one}} of the main subjects of this paper. The lance has a construction, that makes possible even complete elimination of carrier gas introduction into liquid metal with proper particles stream range. The paper shows the results of the tests of lances with various geometrical parameters and model experiments with diphase stream force measurement. Research limitations/implications: The future research should be made with various type of powdered materials to find the question what are the limits of changing the most important parameters (grain size, stream concentration etc.). The limitation is number of values being analyzed (in powder injection processes there are many) in experimental plan. Practical implications: The lance can be used for powders pneumatic injection but only for small its quantities (e. g. microalloying) because non-immersed lance should be used with low stream concentration. The usage of that lance can decrease liquid alloy heat losses (not introducing carrier gas into liquid) and lance consumption (non-immersed in liquid bath). Originality/value: The original value of the paper is taking into account the parameter called by authors “diphase stream force” on liquid metal surface being “attacked” by particles (or carrier gas stream). Nobody (in author’s opinion) was analyzed that problem with connection in powder injection processes. The paper can be helpful for everybody who is studying pneumatic injection processes...|$|E
