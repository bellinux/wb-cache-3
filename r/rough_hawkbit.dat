5000|$|Leontodon hispidus is {{a species}} of hawkbit known by the common names bristly hawkbit and <b>rough</b> <b>hawkbit.</b> It is native to Europe {{but it can be}} found {{throughout}} North America as an introduced species.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} fields and meadows in the Telkkämäki {{heritage}} farm {{because of the}} mowing and grazing of the grounds associated with agriculture. Plant species in the old slash-and-burn clearings include the bluebutton (or field scabious), common yarrow (Achillea millefolium) and <b>rough</b> <b>hawkbit.</b> Meadow flowers {{to be found in}} Telkkämäki include the fireweed, meadow buttercup, wild angelica and red campion.|$|E
5000|$|Barrow Burn Meadows is a {{northern}} hay meadow characterised {{by the presence}} of a rich diversity of grasses, and an abundance of herbs. Species found at the site include sweet vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), crested dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), red fescue (Festuca rubra) with tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa), creeping bent (Agrostis stolonifera), Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), yellow oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) and wood crane’s-bill (Geranium sylvaticum). Herb species include pignut (Conopodium majus), bitter vetch (Lathyrus montanus), meadow vetchling (L. pratensis), <b>rough</b> and autumn <b>hawkbit</b> (Leontodon hispidus) and (L. autumnalis), cat’s-ear (Hypochoeris radicata), selfheal (Prunella vulgaris), common bird’s-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor), changing forget-me-not (Myosotis discolor), common knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare). The southern of the two fields provides a habitat for smooth, hairy and intermediate lady’s mantle (Alchemilla glabra, A. filicaulis and A. xanthochlora), whilst the northern field supports eyebright (Euphrasia agg.), quaking grass (Briza media) and melancholy thistle (Cirsium helenioides).|$|R
50|$|The species {{occurs in}} {{different}} plant communities, most commonly in highly diverse Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis grasslands that exist because of intense grazing by sheep or rabbits. These grasslands contain grasses, dicots, and mosses in different mixtures. The turf is short, continuous and consist of very small individual plants. Characteristic species {{that may be}} abundant in these grasslands in the UK include the grasses Sheep's fescue Festuca ovina, red fescue F. rubra, Quaking-grass Briza media, crested hair-grass Koeleria macrantha and Crested dog's-tail Cynosurus cristatus, the dicots ribwort plantain Plantago lanceolata, Small burnet Poterium sanguisorba ssp. sanguisorba, Common Bird's-foot Trefoil Lotus corniculatus, Common Cat's-ear Hypochaeris radicata, Mouse-ear hawkweed Pilosella officinarum, <b>Rough</b> <b>hawkbit</b> Leontodon hispidus and Dwarf thistle Cirsium acaule, and the moss Pseudoscleropodium purum.|$|E
50|$|Certain knapweeds have a {{tendency}} to dominate large stretches of landscape together with a few other plants, typically one or two grasses and as many other large herbs. The common knapweed (C. nigra) for example is plentiful in the mesotrophic grasslands of England and nearby regions. It is most prominently found in pastures or meadows dominated by cock's-foot (Dactylis glomerata) as well as either of crested dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and false oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius). It is also often found in mesotrophic grassland on rendzinas and similar calcareous soils in association with glaucous sedge (Carex flacca), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), and either tor-grass (Brachypodium pinnatum) and <b>rough</b> <b>hawkbit</b> (Leontodon hispidus), or upright brome (Bromus erectus). In these grasslands, greater knapweed (C. scabiosa) is found much more rarely by comparison, often in association with red fescue (Festuca rubra) in addition to cock's-foot and false oat-grass.|$|E
5000|$|Leontodon taraxacoides is {{a species}} of hawkbit known by the common name lesser hawkbit, <b>rough</b> <b>hawkbit,</b> or hairy hawkbit. It is native to Europe and North Africa {{but it can be}} found in many other places across the globe as an {{introduced}} species and often a noxious weed. This is a dandelion-like herb growing patches of many erect, leafless stems from a basal rosette of leaves. The leaves are 2 to 15 centimeters long, 0.5 to 2.5 centimeters wide, entire or lobed, and green in color. Atop the stems are solitary flower heads which are ligulate, containing layered rings of ray florets with no disc florets. The florets are yellow with toothed tips. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus of scales. Fruits {{near the center of the}} flower head are rough, while those growing along the edges of the head are smooth.|$|E
50|$|A {{diversity}} of soil types, slope, aspect and {{past and present}} land-use {{has given rise to}} various grassland communities. Historical evidence suggests that large areas of grassland are of great antiquity, and areas which were cultivated {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century have experienced nearly 100 years of chalk grassland re-colonisation. Parts of East Salisbury Plain and the periphery of Central and West comprise areas of grassland currently managed for grazing pasture and hay-cutting, whilst the middle of Centre and West are ungrazed. A large proportion of Salisbury Plain supports upright brome (Bromus erectus) species-rich grassland, within which a continuous floristic variation is seen. A widespread type on the plain is characterised by an abundance of red fescue (Festuca rubra), crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), lady's bedstraw (Galium verum), <b>rough</b> <b>hawkbit</b> (Leontodon hispidus), common rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium) and dropwort (Filipendula vulgaris). The high constancy of this last species is a distinctive feature of the upright brome grasslands on Salisbury Plain and is otherwise only known from one other site in Hampshire. Where upright brome is less dominating, plants such as small scabiosa (Scabiosa columbaria), clustered bellflower (Campanula glomerata), dyer's greenweed (Genista tinctoria), kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) and horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) are characteristic associates.The rare and notable plants which occur here include burnt-tip orchid (Neotinea ustulata), slender bedstraw (Galium pumilum), field fleawort (Senecio integrifolius) and the nationally scarce British endemic early gentian (Gentianella anglica). Particularly associated with long established turf on thin rendzina soils, and rabbit-grazed areas of the eastern and central ranges, are low-growing perennials including squinancy-wort (Asperula cynanchica), chalk milkwort (Polygala calcarea), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), wild thyme (Thymus praecox), the nationally scarce bastard toadflax (Thesium humifusum) and purple milk-vetch (Astragalus danicus) in its most southerly British station.|$|E
40|$|Field {{bordering}} flower strips {{not just}} only improves the biodiversity but {{also serves as}} a source of beneficial compounds. Some of the plants in these strips can be really interesting source of lipids, the oils extracted from their seeds can be important for food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. Six species of plants from flowering strips in Belgium were investigated for their seed oil content. The oil from seeds was extracted by cold extraction technique using chloroform/methanol in 2 : 1 ratio as solvent. Oil extraction from seeds of Red Clover (Trifolium pratense), <b>Rough</b> <b>Hawkbit</b> (Leontodon hispidus), Cow Parsley (Anthriscus sylvestris), St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), Common Yarrow (Achillea millefollium) and Birdsfoot Trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) plant species was done on wet weight which came out to be 7. 89 ± 0. 11 %, 11. 86 ± 0. 07 %, 14. 78 ± 0. 31 %, 24. 20 ± 0. 02 %, 20. 08 ± 0. 15 % and 7. 04 ± 0. 12 % respectively. The physicochemical properties of the extracted oils were analyzed. Some of these oils can be of great commercial value...|$|E
