5|$|The {{interactions}} of hydrogen with various metals {{are very important}} in metallurgy, as many metals can suffer hydrogen embrittlement, and in developing safe ways to store it {{for use as a}} fuel. Hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> and transition metals and can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the metal crystal lattice.|$|E
5|$|Found {{with almost}} all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, {{lutetium}} {{is very difficult}} to separate from other elements. The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite: (Ce, La, etc.)PO4 which contains 0.0001% of the element. The abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust is only about 0.5mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of lutetium (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year. Pure lutetium metal {{is very difficult to}} prepare. It is one of the rarest and most expensive of the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> with the price about US$10,000 per kilogram, or about one-fourth that of gold.|$|E
5|$|The uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho H2 {{increases}} with increasing temperature; thus rapidly condensed H2 contains {{large quantities of}} the high-energy ortho form that converts to the para form very slowly. The ortho/para ratio in condensed H2 is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the hydrogen liquid, leading to loss of liquefied material. Catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion, such as ferric oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals,</b> uranium compounds, chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling.|$|E

40|$|The <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metal</b> (REM) {{content in}} some of the apatite-bearing iron ore {{deposits}} in Northern Sweden has been studied. The results are presented in two groups. The first group includes 19 specimens with the percentage of phosphorus varying between 4. 91 and 17. 57, in which the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metal</b> content is as follows: Kiirunavaara 6. 560 ppm, Maimberger 5, 760 ppm, Leveiiniemi 1, 545 ppm, Rektorn 3, 275 ppm, Haukivaara 5, 295 ppm, Henry 5, 210 ppm, Nukutusvaara 6, 730 ppm and Lappmalmen 5, 890 ppm. The second group comprises 44 samples from a drilled cross section in the Lower Hauki ore-bearing rock series. The correlation between the phosphorus and <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metal</b> assays in the samples uggests that most of the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> content is associated with phosphate minerals. The <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metal</b> content of the apatite-iron ores is between that of the Kola peninsula (USSR) apatites and the apatites in granite-pegmatites. The <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metal</b> content in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks is commonly about the same as in the apatite-iron ore from Northern Sweden. The distribution of the <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> suggests that the apatite-iron ores of Lappland are not of magmatic origin...|$|R
5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals,</b> including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium {{can form}} alloys and {{intermediate}} compounds with most other metals. Exceptions include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals; and magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium of the alkaline earth metals; and europium and ytterbium of the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals.</b> Partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and tungsten, which are soluble in liquid plutonium, but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium. Gallium, aluminium, americium, scandium and cerium can stabilize the δ phase of plutonium for room temperature. Silicon, indium, zinc and zirconium allow formation of metastable δ state when rapidly cooled. High amounts of hafnium, holmium and thallium also allows some retention of the δ phase at room temperature. Neptunium {{is the only}} element that can stabilize the α phase at higher temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The La3+ ion is similarly-sized to {{the early}} {{lanthanides}} of the cerium group (those up to samarium and europium) that immediately follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate, silicate and carbonate minerals, such as monazite (MIIIPO4) and bastnäsite (MIIICO3F), where M refers to all the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> except scandium and the radioactive promethium (mostly Ce, La, and Y). Bastnäsite is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and silicon tetrafluoride: the product is then dried and leached with water, leaving the early lanthanide ions, including lanthanum, in solution.|$|E

40|$|Cationic alkyl {{complexes}} {{of group}} 4 metals {{have been the}} subject of intensive investigations over the past two decades because of their crucial importance in catalytic olefin polymerization. 1 In contrast, cationic alkyl species of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> (group 3 and lanthanide) metals are much less developed. 2, 3 However, recent studies have shown that cationic <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metal</b> alkyls are highly efficient olefin polymerization catalysts 3 and can show unique activities that differ from those of group 4 metals. 3 a,b,e Treatment of a neutral di- or trialkyl precursor with an equimolar amount of a borate compound proved to be a convenient route to generate a cationic trivalent <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metal</b> alkyl species.

5|$|The trends {{going down}} from {{scandium}} and yttrium to lanthanum {{tend to be}} more similar to those going down groups 1 and 2 in the periodic table, while those going down from scandium and yttrium to lutetium {{tend to be more}} similar to those in the early transition metals. Since Sc3+, Y3+, and La3+ still have a low enough charge for their compounds to be predominantly ionic, unlike Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+, {{it has been argued that}} lanthanum and the rest of group 3 should be considered at best atypical transition metals, as their chemistry is focused on the predominantly ionic +3 state and they have a low ability to form coordination compounds or organometallic compounds. Indeed, lanthanum is a strongly electropositive metal, comparable to calcium in electropositivity. The <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> in general are more similar in reactivity to the alkaline earth metals that immediately precede them than to the transition metals proper which follow them.|$|E
5|$|Samarium is {{not found}} free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is {{contained}} in many minerals, including monazite, bastnäsite, cerite, gadolinite and samarskite; monazite (in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%) and bastnäsite are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of samarium are estimated at two million tonnes; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes. Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it {{is followed by the}} US (about 5,000tonnes) and India (2,700tonnes). Samarium is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about 30USD/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides. Whereas mischmetal – a mixture of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> containing about 1% of samarium – has long been used, relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently, through ion exchange processes, solvent extraction techniques, and electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium(III) chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum. The product is then distilled to separate samarium (boiling point 1794°C) and lanthanum (b.p.3464°C).|$|E
