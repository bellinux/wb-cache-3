40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1985 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaMilitary {{aerospace}} test ranges {{are increasingly}} being called upon to conduct missions utilizing large numbers of participating units, or targets. Precision, position and trajectory data must be recorded on all participants. In addition, weapon/target engagements must be scored and real-time range safety considerations must be accommodated. This requires precision metric data be available in real-time on all participating targets. One solution to these problems, is utilization of multiple target tracking radars which incorporate electronic beam steering to quickly move from one target to another in sequence. This paper briefly recounts the history of <b>range</b> <b>instrumentation</b> <b>radars,</b> points {{out some of the}} advantages of using multi-target radars, and highlights the specifications and design of a multiple target <b>instrumentation</b> <b>radar</b> now being acquired by the U. S. Army for use at White Sands Missile Range and the Kwajalein Missile Range...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1999 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThe loss {{of radio}} {{frequency}} (RF) spectrum {{for use in}} testing has steadily increased the likelihood that users {{of the few remaining}} frequencies available to test ranges will experience scheduling conflicts and interference with nontest users. A gradual increase in the base of test customers engaged in scientific, military, and commercial R&D, point toward a near term situation in which more test customers will be competing for fewer frequencies. The test ranges, often operating in close geographical proximity with other communications-intensive functions as well as with each other, will also encounter increasing out-of-band and adjacent-channel interference. This projected growth of R&Drelated testing constrained to operate in a diminished RF spectrum (and a more confined test space), will undoubtedly stimulate the development of new products that make more efficient use of the RF spectrum. This paper describes one such innovative approach to spectrum sharing. The authors assess the operational need for an affordable miniaturized avionics instrument package based on a C-band radar transponder integrated with a Global Positioning System/Inertial Measurement Unit (GPS/IMU). The proposed approach would make use of frequencies already allocated for use by existing C-band aeronautical transponders. It would augment the format of the transponder output data to include the vehicle position obtained from an onboard GPS/IMU. Existing <b>range</b> <b>instrumentation</b> <b>radars,</b> such as the venerable AN/FPS- 16, could be modified with lowcost upgrade kits to provide uniformly higher accuracy over the entire transponder coverage range...|$|R

This complement of transportable systems can be deployed to provide complete range capabilities at remote locations around the world. While Wallops Island is the prime location for range services, major sounding rocket campaigns have been supported at Poker Flat, Alaska; Andoya, Norway; and Kwajalein Island, Marshall Islands.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Orbital Debris Program Office is teaming {{with the}} US Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Maui Optical Site to deploy a {{moderate}} field-of-view, 1. 3 m aperture, optical telescope for orbital debris applications. The telescope will be {{located on the}} island of Legan in the Kwajalein Atoll and is scheduled for completion in the Spring of 2011. The telescope is intended to sample both low inclination/high eccentricity orbits and near geosynchronous orbits. The telescope will have a 1 deg diagonal field-of-view on a 4 K x 4 K CCD. The telescope is expected to be able to detect 10 -cm diameter debris at geosynchronous altitudes (5 sec exposure assuming a spherical specular phase function w/ albedo = 0. 13). Once operational, the telescope has the potential of conducting simultaneous observations with radars operated by the US Army at Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA) and located {{on the island of}} Roi-Namur, approximately 55 km to the north of Legan. Four radars, representing 6 frequency bands, are available for use: ALTAIR (ARPA-Long <b>Range</b> Tracking and <b>Instrumentation</b> <b>Radar)</b> operating at VHF & UHF, TRADEX (Target Resolution and Discrimination Experiment) operating at L-band and S-band, ALCOR (ARPA-Lincoln C-band Observables Radar) operating at S-band, and MMW (Millimeter Wave) Radar operating at Ka-band.

Just 100 miles up the coast from where the Wright brothers first flew their airplane at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Orbital Sciences Corporation is planning to launch its new Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) system from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS), located at NASA GSFC's WFF. Orbital's COTS system design {{is based on the}} new Taurus II rocket with a liquid oxygen (LOX) /kerosene (RP- 1) first stage powered by two Aerojet AJ- 26 engines. The Taurus II second stage is ATK's Castor 30 solid propellant motor derived from their flight proven Castor 120. The spacecraft, known as Cygnus, is derived from Orbital's heritage DAWN and STAR spacecraft projects and International Space Station cargo carriers. The Program is driven by the retirement of the space shuttle, and the United States lacking domestic capability to send crew and cargo to the International Space Station. As a consequence, NASA faces a cargo resupply shortfall of 40 metric tons (approximately 88, 000 pounds) between 2011 and 2015 that cannot be met by international partners' space vehicles. Bermuda has {{played an important role in}} the United States space program since the 1960 s. The former NASA Tracking Station on Bermuda's Coopers Island had range safety systems for command and control, and Missile <b>Instrumentation</b> Precision <b>Radars</b> (MIPRs) providing exact vehicle position and slaving for command destruct systems. Telemetry systems supported scientific spacecraft and manned space flight (i. e., Apollo, Space Transportation System [STS], and Spacelab) with high gain antenna systems. With the advent of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System and changes in the STS flight envelope in the late 1990 s, NASA no longer 2 required Bermuda and deactivated the site. NASA instrumentation was removed in early 2000, and the property returned to the Government of Bermuda (GoB). This paper defines the process undertaken to secure an agreement with the GoB to establish a temporary tracking site and describes the technical approach and analysis conducted that justifies bringing Bermuda back as a critical NASA tracking site as it was during the Apollo era and the early years of the Space Shuttle.
