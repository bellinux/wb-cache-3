40|$|ABSTRACT: Guilan {{forests are}} one of the natural {{habitats}} for the varieties of wild plum and tomato that will be consumed fresh and processed by the residents of the areas. In this study, the amount of total phenol, antioxidant capacity, total acid, the amount of total soluble solids and the ratio of total soluble solids to total acid for each genotype were analyzed under completely randomized plan with three replications. Results from this study indicate that the total soluble solids of fruits were different in the range between 03 / 0 and 93 / 15 ° Brix. So that the genotype of “sour <b>red</b> <b>plum</b> ” had the highest and genotype of “sour Black plum ” had the lowest percentage of soluble solids. Genotype of “large sloe ” with an average of 13 / 6 and the genotype of “golden plum ” with an average of 64 / 3 % of malic acid had the highest and lowest rates of the total acid. The ratio of total soluble solids to total acid of fruits was different in the range between 008 / 0 to 815 / 3. The genotype of “golden plum ” had the highest and genotype of “sour black plum ” had the lowest ratio of total soluble solids to total acid. The amount of total phenol in fruits peel and pulp mixture was in the range between 282 and 333 / 600. Genotypes of “golden plum ” and “red sloe ” had, respectively, the highest and lowest total phenol amount. Peel and pulp mixture of “sour <b>red</b> <b>plum</b> ” genotype with an average of 58 / 66 % had the highest, and “sour black plum ” with 35 / 62 % had the lowest antioxidant activity. It was also found that there is a positive linear correlation between total phenol and antioxidant activity of different genotypes of tomato tree...|$|R
