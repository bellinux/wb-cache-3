Troubleshooting of the failure by the ISS crew found that the root cause was condensation inside the electrical connectors, {{which led to a}} short-circuit that triggered the power off command to all three of the <b>redundant</b> <b>processing</b> units.

50|$|Amorphosynthesis, {{also called}} a hemi-sensory deficit, is a neuropsychological {{condition}} in which a patient experiences unilateral inattention to sensory input. This phenomenon is frequently associated with damage to the right cerebral hemisphere resulting in severe sensory deficits that are observed on the contralesional (left) side of the body. A right-sided deficit is less commonly observed and the effects are reported to be temporary and minor. Evidence suggests that the right cerebral hemisphere has a dominant role in attention and awareness to somatic sensations through ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation. In contrast, the left cerebral hemisphere is activated only by contralateral stimuli. Thus, {{the left and right}} cerebral hemispheres exhibit <b>redundant</b> <b>processing</b> to the right-side of the body and a lesion to the left cerebral hemisphere can be compensated by the ipsiversive processes of the right cerebral hemisphere. For this reason, right-sided amorphosynthesis is less often observed and is generally associated with bilateral lesions.|$|E

50|$|The most {{westerly}} of the terminals {{is owned}} by Eni of Italy. It receives gas from two 30-inch pipelines from the Hewett field (27.7 km and 32.8 km long) and a 62 km long 20-inch pipeline from Lancelot 48/17A offshore installation (LAPS complex). A decommissioned 24-inch pipeline formerly delivered gas from the Thames 49/28A offshore installation. Gas and liquid from each pipeline are received and processed separately. After gas and condensate are separated in vessel-type slugcatchers and filter-separators each gas stream is fiscally metered (for tax purposes). The two Hewett field gas streams are combined and increased in pressure through an eductor. The gas stream was formerly treated with amine to remove sulphur compounds, this facility was decommissioned in 2000 when production from the sour Hewett Upper Bunter reservoir was shut-in. The gas is comingled with the LAPS gas then compressed. It was formerly dehydrated using triethylene glycol and underwent hydrocarbon dew point reduction by chilling with propane. Finally it was fiscally metered (for sales) and transferred to the Bacton NTS plant. Formerly the terminal had pentane storage tanks and a truck loading facility. The terminal has two GE 11MW Frame 3 and one GE 3.7MW Frame 1 gas turbines, connected to three centrifugal compressors. In 2011 the Eni Terminal was split by segregating the reception {{and some of the}} compression facilities from the dehydration and dewpoint control plant, the latter was decommissioned. Now after compression the gas is sent to the Perenco site for dehydration and dewpoint control. The separated condensate is also sent to the Perenco site.

This demand for fault-tolerance is usually sat-isfied by applying <b>redundant</b> <b>processing</b> structures in-side each PES and, additionally, configuring multiple PES redundantly. Instead of minimising the failure probability of single PESs, it is also desirable to provide a redundant configuration of PESs with the capability to re-start single units at runtime.

Some approaches for avoiding the ill-effects of <b>processing</b> <b>redundant</b> data include: tagging all data items with a unique identifier, controlling the flow of data throughout the network or tracking pedigree information for each data item. Recently, Covariance Intersection provides an alternative solution to Level 1 Fusion {{in the presence of}} redundant information. This technique allows fusion processes to combine redundant information without the results becoming inconsistent and overconfident. As the fusion community attacks the higher levels of information fusion, we are still faced with processing data items in the presence of redundant information. Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories has developed a technique analogous to Covariance Intersection for combining information using propositional logic. As a result, if a propositional inference engine consumes data from distributed sources that have redundant inputs, the output of that inference engine will still be consistent and will not overestimate the confidence. This approach simplifies propositional inference in the presence of redundant information, allowing for inference over a distributed network of fusion nodes. 1...|$|R
