5|$|The {{borders of}} Albania again became {{the cause of}} {{international}} conflict when Italian General Enrico Tellini and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader Benito Mussolini was incensed, and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation,</b> Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy fifty million lire in reparations. The Greeks {{said they would not}} pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.|$|E
5|$|After the show, WWE {{was criticized}} for a {{malfunction}} in the pyrotechnics during The Undertaker's victory celebration. During the celebration, a hot cable for pyrotechnics was sent flying into audience members in the upper seating bowl of the stadium, leaving 45 injured, with some hospitalized. The accident was apparently due to a cable which fireworks were traveling across snapping, thus resulting in the fireworks exploding into the top rows of the upper bowl of the stadium. WWE's corporate website released a statement afterward stating that they would investigate the incident, but the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> were never released.|$|E
5|$|Freddie Stowers was {{the first}} of only two African American to receive the Medal of Honor for actions in World War I. Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, {{continuing}} to lead and encourage his men even after being twice wounded. Stowers died of his wounds, and was shortly afterwards recommended for the Medal of Honor; however, this recommendation was never processed. In 1990, the Department of the Army conducted a review and the Stowers recommendation was uncovered. An investigation was launched, and based on <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> the award of the Medal of Honor was approved. Stowers' Medal of Honor was presented on April 24, 1991—seventy-three years after he was killed-in-action. Henry Johnson's Medal of Honor was presented on June 2, 2015-eighty five years after he died.|$|E

5|$|The election, meanwhile, had aroused papal {{suspicions of}} undue royal influence, and Innocent sent Stephen Langton, the exiled Archbishop of Canterbury to {{investigate}} Hugh {{and the circumstances}} of his election. Langton was also to investigate rumours that Hugh was not celibate, and had two daughters. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> must have been satisfactory, as Hugh was consecrated on 20 December 1209 at Melun. The consecration was performed by Langton. Hugh was in exile in France until he returned to England on 16 July 1213. His only known activity while in exile was the writing of a will, which was dated November 1212 and was drawn up at St Martin de Garenne, near Paris.|$|E
5|$|The {{perpetrators}} were apprehended in 1989 {{under the}} administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Moro and Zorrilla were sentenced to 25 and 35 years in prison respectively, but were released from prison in February 2009 for good conduct after serving {{at least half of}} their sentences. Several public intellectuals, journalists, press freedom organizations, newspapers, and politicians protested their releases. Zorrilla returned to prison later that year after he failed to provide a formal letter petitioning his release. On 10 September 2013, Zorrilla was released from prison after a Mexico City judge granted him the opportunity to fulfill the remaining years of his sentence at his residence due to unstable health conditions. The Mexican government closed the case after the arrests, but many journalists doubted the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> and believed that the masterminds behind the murder case remained at large.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} displaced 10,000 Serb {{refugees from}} Mrkonjić Grad, adding {{to a growing}} humanitarian crisis as another 30,000 Serbs fled Sanski Most before the ARBiH captured it {{in the final days}} of Operation Sana. Approximately 6,000 non-Serbs were forced to flee their homes in Prijedor and Novi Grad by Bosnian Serb forces. According to Bosnian Serb sources, 480 Serbs died or went missing in the fighting in the area of Mrkonjić Grad. The figure includes 181 bodies recovered in a mass grave at the town's Serbian Orthodox cemetery. According to the Republika Srpska police who investigated the scene and interviewed witnesses, most of the dead were VRS prisoners of war or civilians who were killed by the 4th Guards Brigade to avenge the death of Colonel Andrija Matijaš, the brigade's deputy commander. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> were forwarded to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), but the ICTY did not pursue the matter. , an investigation by the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities against 27 high-ranking HV and HVO officers and Croatian officials is ongoing.

5|$|The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> into Wheldon's death were {{released}} on December 15, 2011. In a report prepared by crash investigators, {{it was found}} that Wheldon's death was caused by an impact with the catch fencing around the circuit. Brian Barnhart further rejected claims that the banking had also contributed to the accident, stating that it created two ideal racing lines, and that these lines made the location of cars more predictable for other drivers; {{at the time of the}} accident, all 34 cars had been behaving as expected. The report also revealed that the right front pull rod of the suspension assembly penetrated Wheldon's survival cell, though it did not cause him any injury. The report recommended further investigation of this phenomenon, as it was the first recorded incident of its kind in nine years of the use of the IR03 and later IR05 model chassis, which was being retired at the end of the race. The pull-rod suspension chassis is not being utilised in the DW12.|$|E
5|$|Van der Sloot (then age 17), {{along with}} the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak (then age 21) and Satish (then age 18), was arrested on 9 June 2005, as {{a suspect in the}} 30 May 2005 {{disappearance}} of an 18-year-old American woman, Natalee Holloway, who was declared legally dead six years after she disappeared. The Kalpoes were released from custody on 4 July, but were re-arrested on 26 August on suspicion of rape and murder, while Van der Sloot remained in custody. Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes were released on 3 September {{because of a lack of}} evidence. After his release, Van Der Sloot was required to stay within Dutch territory pending the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation.</b> On 5 September 2005, he returned to the Netherlands to study international business management at the HAN University of Applied Sciences. On 14 September, a higher court removed the travel restrictions. Gerold G. Dompig, former deputy commissioner of the Aruba Police Force, stated that the initial arrests were made prematurely under pressure from Holloway's family. Dompig charged that the family sidetracked the investigation by making it difficult for the police to collect evidence to solve the case.|$|E

25|$|A {{criminal}} {{investigation of the}} bombings was completed in 2002. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation,</b> and the court ruling that followed, concluded that they were organized by Achemez Gochiyaev, who remains at large, and ordered by Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif (both of whom were later killed), {{in retaliation for the}} Russian counteroffensive against their incursion into Dagestan. Six other suspects have been convicted by Russian courts. However, many observers, including State Duma deputies Yuri Shchekochikhin, Sergei Kovalev and Sergei Yushenkov, cast doubts on the official version and sought an independent investigation. Some others, including David Satter, Yury Felshtinsky, Vladimir Pribylovsky and Alexander Litvinenko, as well as the secessionist Chechen authorities, claimed that the 1999 bombings were a false flag attack coordinated by the FSB in order to win public support for a new full-scale war in Chechnya, which boosted Prime Minister and former FSB Director Vladimir Putin's popularity, brought the pro-war Unity Party to the State Duma in the 1999 parliamentary election and him to the presidency within a few months. Felshtinsky and Litvinenko had links with the late Boris Berezovsky, an exiled oligarch who advocated the forcible overthrowing of the Russian Government. For example, Berezovsky sponsored Litivinenko's book.|$|E
25|$|The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> {{were that}} the {{shooting}} spree {{was caused by a}} mental illness (chronic delusions similar to schizophrenia), and not a political agenda. Zavistonovičius held a gun for hunting since 1975. The permits were periodically renewed. As part of the renewal process, Zavistonovičius had to pass an examination by a psychiatrist. None of the psychiatrists who examined Zavistonovičius noticed anything suspicious, a fact which caused much controversy. During the investigation it was uncovered that in 1985, Zavistonovičius had been referred to and examined by the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital. Zavistonovičius was married three times. The third wife separated from him just ten months before the shooting and described his morbid jealousy and persecutory delusions, even though neighbors saw him as an intelligent and helpful man. Relatives had begun noticing various symptoms since 1978, which may have been related to a car crash in 1976. In light of these findings, the prosecutor's office explored a possibility of charging with negligence the seven doctors who signed off on Zavistonovičius' gun permit. However, it was determined that the doctors were not negligent: without a centralized database, they could not know that Zavistonovičius was treated at a psychiatric hospital, and in public his symptoms were masked and controlled well enough to pass the brief examination without suspicion.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1870s during the Grant Administration, lucrative postal route {{contracts}} {{were given to}} local contractors on the Pacific Coast and Southern regions of the United States. [...] These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was given on official Post Office documents. [...] These remote routes were hundreds of miles long {{and went to the}} most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy. In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts, an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office; the ring consisted of contractors, postal clerks, and various intermediary brokers. Straw bidding was at its highest practice while John Creswell, Grant's 1869 appointment, was Postmaster-General. An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell, but he was censured by the minority House report. [...] A $40,000 bribe to the 42nd Congress by one postal contractor had tainted the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation.</b> In 1876, another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years.|$|E
500|$|On December 9, 2011, IndyCar {{decided that}} {{they were not going to}} return to Las Vegas for the 2012 season.

As of that date, the investigation into the accident was still ongoing. IndyCar was holding back on the release of its 2012 schedule until the investigation concluded. [...] The IndyCar series also conducted an investigation into whether or not the series should continue racing on high-banked ovals such as Las Vegas and Texas Motor Speedway in Denton, Texas.
