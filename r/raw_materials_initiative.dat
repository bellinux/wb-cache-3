However, securing the supply of raw materials based on an appropriate EU minerals policy has been scarcely treated by the decision-makers in the last decades. Solely the impact of price development of international commodity markets {{in the last years}} induces a re-thinking of this field.

30|$|The global impacts {{related to}} {{material}} consumption in Europe are mentioned {{in some of}} the EU policy documents, most notably with regard to biomass consumption. However, the results of the MRIO-based assessments in this paper suggest that a supply chain perspective is of key importance for the EU economy, which has a higher material import dependence than all other world regions (see Giljum et al. 2015). The consumption of goods and services in the EU is to a large and rapidly growing extent dependent on indirect material extractions taking place outside the EU’s territory. This has environmental implications, as <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> originate to an increasing extent from developing and emerging economies, which often have lower levels of environmental standards compared to industrialized countries (for example, Hilson 2012). The expansion of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> extraction activities also often leads to an increasing number of environmental conflicts with the local population, which faces, e.g., dislocations due to expansions of mining areas or accumulations of air and water pollution with severe negative effects on their daily lives (Martinez-Alier 2014). Thus, if considering pollution and other negative environmental consequences related to material extraction in impact-oriented material footprint indicators (van der Voet et al. 2009), the geographical location of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> extraction could play an increasingly important role in determining Europe’s environmental performance. Also, labor conditions are often very low in developing country activities related to agricultural production or mining, and material extraction often fosters enclave types rather than inclusive forms of development (for example, Bird 2014). As a final consumer of products to which these <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> serve as direct and indirect inputs, Europe should acknowledge its share in the responsibility for the environmental and social conditions in other world regions. Europe could more actively engage in financial, technological and knowledge support in extraction countries to raise environmental and social standards, as underlying, for example, the idea of a Global Marshall Plan (Yunker 2014). This responsibility is currently not sufficiently assumed in EU policies related to <b>raw</b> <b>materials.</b> For example, the <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>initiative</b> is strongly focused on securing access to resources in particular in developing countries, which sometimes contradicts the objectives of EU development policies, which aim at helping developing countries combat poverty through investing in the sustainable management of their natural resources (Heinrich Böll Foundation 2011).|$|R
30|$|Before {{starting}} such {{a mapping}} exercise, however, our paper introduces {{the more recent}} debate about interconnections between different resources, what we {{refer to as the}} “resource nexus” [4 – 8]. The resource nexus is distinct from the prevailing discussion of critical materials done by the European Union’s (EU) <b>Raw</b> <b>Materials</b> <b>Initiative</b> or the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE), both of whom identify priority materials of concern following more narrow criteria of availability and access.|$|E

After years of hesitation, this may undoubtedly be considered a very progressive step. The article lists the most relevant reasons why the EU should promptly proceed to the discussion and preparation of a similar material of higher legal force for energy minerals.

This road leads to Poynar Dam via Falsonda then Pisai and then connects to Mandangad Road. This road is a short route via Ambet to Mumbai. This road is a tar road now and was constructed under the Employment Guarantee Scheme by the Government of Maharashtra. This road was first constructed with the help of locally available <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> under the <b>initiative</b> of the then Sarpanch of Furus Garam Panchayat, Mr. Kamaluddin from Falsonda. Some anti-progress people then lay down on the road to stop it from being constructed. This visionary Sarpanch then stopped that part of the job and started digging in another area. This was how this road was finally completed which now plays a vital role in connecting Furus to the surrounding areas.|$|R
40|$|Current {{industrial}} {{environmental regulations}} favor processes with Integrative Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC). While several systems are regarded by different international directives as IPPC Best Available Techniques or Technologies (BAT), {{none of these}} systems are capable handling various pollutants of both gaseous and aquatic effluents. Additional hinder to a BAT-IPPC complete procedure are hazardous or uneconomical byproducts of the IPPC processes and significant auxiliary costs for consumables and energy. The current research and subsequent projects are aimed {{to the development of}} a Biological Integrative Pollution Prevention and Control (Bio-IPPC) system. Such system can be incorporated in various industrial processes, in a way that the byproduct is without hazardous potential and may be used as an economical <b>raw</b> <b>material.</b> The main <b>initiative</b> and heart of these systems is a micro-algae reactor, which is capable of treating various types of industrial pollutants both in the gaseous and aquatic phases. The algae nutrition is through thin-film circulation of the aquatic effluent and the reactor atmosphere is enriched by flue gases. The excessive algal biomass may be utilized for economic purposes starting with animal feedstock, through organic fertilizer and as industrial <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> for biofuels production or direct energy production. The first industrial project is a wastewater (WW) polishing stage to an industry zone WW treatment facility, which ensures high level effluent purification and assimilation of greenhouse gases, which are released during the WW bioremediation process. The second industrial application aims to treat aquatic and gaseous effluents from coal propelled power plants. The <b>raw</b> algal <b>material</b> from both projects although very different, is used for the development of new efficient scheme for bioethanol production. In summary, the system presented is an actual Bio-IPPC that can interactively treat several industrial effluents, while utilizing the algal biomass as a profitable <b>raw</b> <b>material...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract The rare-earth {{elements}} (REEs) and bismuth, being {{classified as}} the ‘most critical raw materials’ (European <b>Raw</b> <b>Materials</b> <b>Initiatives,</b> 2017), {{have a high}} economic importance to the EU combined with a high relative supply risk. REEs are highly important for the evolving technologies such as clean-energy applications, high-technology components, rechargeable batteries, permanent magnets, electric and hybrid vehicles, and phosphors monitors. This scientific research work aims at building a fundamental knowledge base concerning the electronic/molecular structure and properties of rare-earth element (REE) and bismuth complexes with dithiocarbamate (DTC) and 1, 10 -phenanthroline (PHEN) by employing state-of-the-art experimental techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques together with ab initio quantum mechanical computational methods. This combination of methods has played {{a vital role in}} analysing the direct and significant effect of the heavy metal ions on the structural and magnetic resonance properties of the complexes, thereby, providing a framework of structure elucidation. This is of special importance for REEs, which are known to exhibit similar chemical and physical properties. The objectives of the work involve i) a systematic investigation of series of REE(III) as well as bismuth(III) complexes to get a profound understanding of the structure-properties relationship and ii) to find an appropriate theoretical modelling and NMR calculation methods, especially, for heavy metal systems in molecular and/or solid-state. This information can later be used in surface interaction studies of REE/bismuth minerals with DTC as well as in design and development of novel ligands for extraction/separation of metal ions. The REE(III) and bismuth(III) complexes with DTC and PHEN ligands have all provided a unique NMR fingerprint of the metal centre both in liquid and solid phase. The solid-state ¹³C and ¹⁵N NMR spectra of the diamagnetic REE(III) and bismuth(III) complexes were in accord with their structural data obtained by single crystal XRD. The density functional theory (DFT) methods were used to get complementary and refined structural and NMR parameters information for all diamagnetic complexes in the solid-state. The relativistic contributions due to scalar and spin-orbit correlations for the calculated ¹H/¹³C/¹⁵N chemical shifts of REE complexes were analysed using two-component zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA) /DFT while the ‘crystal-lattice’ effects on the NMR parameters were calculated by combining DFT calculations on molecular and periodic solid-state models. The paramagnetic REE complexes display huge differences in their ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectral patterns. The experimental paramagnetic NMR (pNMR) chemical shifts, as well as the sizable difference of the ¹H and ¹³C NMR shifts for these isoelectronic complexes, are well reproduced by the advanced calculations using ab initio/DFT approach. The accuracy of this approach is very promising for further applications to demanding pNMR problems involving paramagnetic f-block elements. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate that a multidisciplinary approach of combined experimental NMR and XRD techniques along with computational modelling and property calculations is highly efficient in studying molecular complexes and solids containing heavy metal systems, such as rare-earths and bismuth...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of a global surge in demand for commodities, {{increasing}} competition and rising prices, several industrialized countries including the European Union have adopted strategies to secure access to raw materials. At the same time, in resource-rich developing countries the debate has intensified about too little benefits from their mineral wealth and about a necessary greater contribution of the mining sector to economic transformation. Through Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty the EU has a legal obligation to consider the interests of developing countries in all its policies. The question therefore arises if the policies outlined and implemented in the EU <b>Raw</b> <b>Materials</b> <b>Initiative</b> (RMI) live up to this obligation.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{drivers for}} resource use and material productivity acrosscountries. This {{is not only}} relevant in light of soaring raw material prices but also because EU policies, such as the "Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources" (COM [2005] 670), the EU <b>Raw</b> <b>Materials</b> <b>Initiative</b> (COM [2008] 699) and various similar policies internationally, seek to better manage materials along their life-cycle and across economies. In order {{to better understand the}} system dynamics of material use, our paper applies methodologies of material flow analysis and regression analysis to identify the major drivers for resource use and decoupling from GDP. Drivers are understood as those factors that exert influence on human activities to use resources. A panel data set is taken for the European Union for the years 1980 – 2000 (EU- 15) and 1992 – 2000 (EU- 25). The main drivers of resource use were found to be energy efficiency, new dwellings and roads construction activities. Shortcomings of the methodology are also discussed...|$|E
30|$|In some {{consumption}} areas, notably food consumption, the Commission {{acknowledges that}} European consumption causes negative global impacts. In general, however, the Commission is rather {{concerned about the}} negative impacts on the EU economy caused by international developments such as restrictions in raw material availability or increasing raw material and food prices (European Commission 2011 a). The most prominent related policy strategy focusing on aspects of import dependency, resource supply and access to natural resources is the <b>Raw</b> <b>Materials</b> <b>Initiative</b> (European Commission 2008, 2011 d). In these documents, the Commission focuses on critical materials, in particular metal ores with high import dependency rates and high relevance for European industries, and describes measures to secure and improve access to these raw materials. In the initiative, certain materials with specifically high dependency rates are identified, such as indium, titanium and niobium, where the EU faces an import dependency rate of 100  % (European Commission 2008). However, the supply and dependency aspects are solely tackled from a perspective of direct imports and inputs into the European economy, not from a supply chain perspective. Issues such as supply chain security and dependency on indirect supplies via imported manufactured goods are not mentioned.|$|E

40|$|Europe {{is confronted}} with an {{increasing}} supply risk of critical raw materials. These {{can be defined}} as materials of which the risks of supply shortage and their impacts on the economy are higher compared to most of other raw materials. Within the framework of the EU Innovation Partnership on <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>Initiative,</b> a list of 14 critical materials was defined, including some bulk metals, industrial minerals, the platinum group metals and rare earth elements. To tackle the supply risk challenge, innovation is required with respect to sustainable primary mining, substitution of critical metals, and urban mining. In these three categories, biometallurgy can play a crucial role. Indeed, microbe-metal interactions have been successfully applied on full scale to win materials from primary sources, but are not sufficiently explored for metal recovery or recycling. On the one hand, this article gives an overview of the microbial strategies that are currently applied on full scale for biomining; on the other hand it identifies technologies, currently developed in the laboratory, which have a perspective for large scale metal recovery and the needs and challenges on which bio-metallurgical research should focus to achieve this ambitious goal...|$|E
40|$|The European Arctic is {{currently}} experiencing an upsurge in mining activities, but future developments will be highly sensitive to mineral price fluctuations.

It is recommended that the EU should adopt a more integrated and transparent view and clearly articulate its interests related to mining in the European Arctic. Building trust and facilitating mechanisms to enhance dialogue with the residents of the North, including indigenous peoples, is an important element of such integration. Information platforms may be based, for example, on INSPIRE infrastructure for spatial information in Europe (designed to contribute to environmental decision-making) or the outcomes of projects like Promine (which mapped European mineral resources). The EU could also support the collection and sharing of mining data and knowledge, for example via the Horizon 2020 programme or the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials. The EU regulatory framework could better contribute to harmonising environmental, economic and social assessments, paying special attention to local social issues and indigenous rights. This could be partly done within the current reform of the EU environmental impact assessment legislation.

40|$|Global {{economy and}} {{particularly}} the world production of goods depends {{to a large extent}} on the supply of raw materials, of resource inputs extracted from the environment as well as an easy access to them. Commodities play an important part in the growth of global production and in the world trade in goods and services. The access to raw materials is vital for sustaining the productive capacity of the economy and also for satisfying domestic demand for industrial goods. On the other side, increasing demand for commodities and the need for assuring a sustainable supply pose great challenges on the world economy. The issue of raw materials supply represents a high - priority theme in the political agenda of the European Union. The <b>Raw</b> <b>Materials</b> <b>Initiative</b> launched in 2008 by the European Commission is based on three main pillars: - to ensure the access to raw materials on world market at undistorted conditions; - to foster sustainable supply of raw materials from European sources; - to reduce the EU's consumption of primary raw materials. (EC, 2008). To this end, EC has started to take action in order to ensure access to resources and avoid supply shortages. A great deal of attention is being paid to the study of recent developments in the global and particular commodity markets, taking into consideration fundamental aspects as supply concentration, governance of producing countries, the pressure of demand and its impact on prices, material's substitutability, stressing the role of resource consumption efficiency, recycling and substitution of vital raw materials and thus providing policy makers and industry with reliable information on how to efficiently manage resource inputs. This paper is dealing with the main developments which occurred during {{the past decade or so}} in the global commodity market, a major driver of the world economy, with particular reference to selected key -markets - as: aluminium, copper, nickel; cotton; corn, meat - swine, rice, wheat, soybeans; oil - emphasizing the issue of price volatility and new challenges in the market...|$|E

40|$|Raw {{materials}} are the physical {{basis of the}} economy and society. Their unique physio-chemical properties provide the functionalities essential to the functioning of technologies. Some of them are essential to the functioning of key and sustainable technologies, which are provisioned to contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable European economy and society. For safeguarding the undistorted supply of raw materials, and in particular of these functional raw materials, the European Commission proposed the European <b>Raw</b> <b>Materials</b> <b>Initiative</b> (RMI). As a strategic policy framework the RMI focuses at ensuring a reliable supply of raw materials from international and European sources. Moreover, parts of the strategy focus on increasing the overall material efficiency of the European economy and society. Thus, RMI features a narrow perspective at different levels. It ignores the threat of geological threats to supply and, similarly to others, the accompanying criticality reports are narrowed down to considering primarily geopolitical threats to the supply of raw materials and their economic impacts. Moreover, a strong influence of industrial actors on the creation of the initiative has been reported. Against this background, this dissertation intends to broaden the perspective on the RMI and of the RMI. The first paper explores whether the proposed solutions of the strategy are consistent with the (geo-) physical basis. By reviewing the underlying concepts, the paper shows that contrary to the assumptions of the RMI the geophysical basis is essential also for increasing overall resource efficiency. The second paper discusses and analyses how promoting particular interests contributed to formulating the current raw material strategy of the European Union. By referring to the theoretical framework of agenda-setting, the paper points out that the proposal for increasing the supply from European sources emerges from a solution to the problems of the extractive industry. It shows that at that moment the problem of threats to the supply of raw materials emerged, requiring a political answer, a policy window opened up for the extractive industry to promote their particular interests. As a consulting expert to the Commission, the industry proposed the solution to their issues as part of the solution for ensuring the undistorted supply of raw materials to the EU. The third paper discusses how the narrowed-down focus of classical risk assessments fails to address issues on various dimensions that could threaten the availability of functionalities. By adapting the story-of-stuff approach, by shifting the frame of criticality assessment to functionalities provided by raw materials, and by broadening the scope and dimensions of criticality assessments, the article conceptualizes an alternative to classical criticality assessment. All three articles provide broader perspectives of the RMI, and by doing so at the same time on the RMI, indicating it might be useful to reconsider its background and its basis. Both might avoid exposure to surprise, when implementing the strategy. (author's abstract) ...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} growth in demand for certain materials, {{compounded}} by political risks associated with the geographical concentration of the supply of them, a shortage of these materials could be a potential bottleneck to the deployment of low-carbon energy technologies. In order to assess whether such shortages could jeopardise {{the objectives of the}} EU’s Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan), an improved understanding of these risks is vital. In particular, this report examines the use of metals in the six low-carbon energy technologies of SET-Plan, namely: nuclear, solar, wind, bioenergy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and electricity grids. The study looks at the average annual demand for each metal for the deployment of the technologies in Europe between 2020 and 2030. The demand of each metal is compared to the respective global production volume in 2010. This ratio (expressed as a percentage) allows comparing the relative stress that the deployment of the six technologies in Europe is expected to create on the global supplies for these different metals. The study identifies 14 metals for which the deployment of the six technologies will require 1 % or more (and in some cases, much more) of current world supply per annum between 2020 and 2030. These 14 significant metals, in order of decreasing demand, are tellurium, indium, tin, hafnium, silver, dysprosium, gallium, neodymium, cadmium, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, niobium and selenium. The metals are examined further in terms of the risks of meeting the anticipated demand by analysing in detail the likelihood of rapid future global demand growth, limitations to expanding supply in the short to medium term, and the concentration of supply and political risks associated with key suppliers. The report pinpoints 5 of the 14 metals to be at high risk, namely: the rare earth metals neodymium and dysprosium, and the by-products (from base metals) indium, tellurium and gallium. The report explores a set of potential mitigation strategies, ranging from expanding European output, increasing recycling and reuse to reducing waste and finding substitutes for these metals in their main applications. A number of recommendations are provided which include: •	ensuring that materials used in significant quantities are included in the Raw Materials Yearbook proposed by the <b>Raw</b> <b>Materials</b> <b>Initiative</b> ad hoc Working Group, •	the publication of regular studies on supply and demand for critical metals, •	efforts to ensure reliable supply of ore concentrates at competitive prices, •	promoting R&D and demonstration projects on new lower cost separation processes, particularly those from by-product or tailings containing rare earths, •	collaborating with other countries/regions with a shared agenda of risk reduction, •	raising awareness and engaging in an active dialogue with zinc, copper and aluminium refiners over by-product recovery, •	creating incentives to encourage by-product recovery in zinc, copper and aluminium refining in Europe, •	promoting the further development of recycling technologies and increasing end-of-life collection, •	measures for the implementation of the revised WEEE Directive, and •	investing broadly in alternative technologies. It is also recommended that a similar study should be carried out to identify the metal requirements and associated bottlenecks in other green technologies, such as electric vehicles, low-carbon lighting, electricity storage and fuel cells and hydrogen.

40|$|The European Commission's (EC) <b>Raw</b> <b>Materials</b> <b>Initiative</b> (RMI) emphasises that raw {{materials}} {{are essential for}} the sound and sustainable functioning of Europe’s industries and, in a broader context, of Europe’s economy and society. The EC is committed to promote the competitiveness of industries related to {{raw materials}}. These industries {{play an important role}} in many downstream sectors in the European Union (EU) such as construction, chemicals, automotive, aerospace, machinery, pharmacy, equipment, renewable energy devices, and defence. These sectors have a combined added value of around EUR 1, 000 billion and provide employment for some 30 million people. Securing the undistorted supply of raw materials and, in particular, Critical Raw Materials (CRM) is thus crucial and requires a sound and continuously updated knowledge base, namely the European Raw Materials Knowledge Base (EURMKB), as highlighted in the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials, in its Strategic Implementation Plan (SIP) from 2013, particularly in the Action area no. II. 8. In this context, and responding to a specific action of the 2015 Circular Economy Communication, the EC's Directorate General (DG) Joint Research Centre (JRC), in close collaboration with DG GROWTH, is advancing its Raw Materials Information System (RMIS). The first version (hereinafter referred to as RMIS 1. 0) was launched in March 2015. The advanced RMIS (hereinafter referred to as RMIS 2. 0) intends to become a one-stop information gateway and knowledge service centre for non-energy, non-food primary (e. g. extracted through mining) and secondary (e. g. recycled, recovered from mining waste) raw materials and materials/commodities. RMIS 2. 0 will (a) support European Union (EU) policy with tailor-made products like the Raw Material Scoreboard and CRM assessments, and (b) to help coordinate other EU level data and information on raw materials. The EU policy support will rely on knowledge from the EUKBRM. This will be made available directly in the RMIS from different sources. The coordination role will be jointly developed with Member States, industry representatives, and other stakeholders, e. g. hosting an entry point to the EURMKB and by further coordination activities with focus on compilation, presentation and application of EU level data. Towards the launch of the RMIS 2. 0 (foreseen in the 4 th quarter of 2017), this “Interim Progress Report & Roadmap” presents the up-to-date development of the RMIS, including the key policy support knowledge needs that shall be fulfilled, and starts linking identified (EURMKB) knowledge needs with knowledge providers. It also presents foreseen key building blocks for the policy support and several development milestones of the RMIS 2. 0 (as of February 2017). The key building blocks focus on a number of themes, including: Critical Raw Materials (CRM) and criticality analysis; Material Flow Analysis (MFA) including the EC Material System Analysis (MSA); the Raw Materials Scoreboard; trade policy aspects; material efficiency and secondary raw materials; sustainability aspects; business & industry; Research & Innovation (R&I); and the policy context. With a view to reinforce synergies and stregthen cooperation with raw materials knowledge providers, as well as with other relevant stakeholder groups (including RMIS users), the first RMIS international workshop will take place in March 2017. The aim of the workshop is to present progress and the foreseen development milestones, as well as to discuss the frame and concept of the cooperation with stakeholders. JRC.

40|$|Critical {{materials}} represent mostly metals {{having a}} big importance {{for the future of}} the economy in the European countries. It is very difficult to replace these critical metals by other metals. Because of their wide application, the demand for these metals is increased, but the production cannot follow their growing consumption. Rare earth elements (REE) belong to critical materials. They include 17 elements, very similar in terms of their chemical and physical properties due to their mineralogical structure (the best-known are lanthanum and thorium, which is radioactive). REE are divided into elements with a lower atomic mass and elements with a higher atomic mass. Heavier metals show a significantly lower presence in the upper earth crust. In 2010, the share of the REE production in China in the global production amounted to 97 %, constituting a near-monopoly in the world market. In different studies, the term “Strategic” is often used instead “of “critical” materials. The materials for military application are called “Strategic” (nickel). In comparison to strategic metals, critical materials have a big importance for the national economies of European countries (platinum group of metals, rare earth elements, cobalt). The European Commission prepared a strategic development plan for critical materials in the next twenty years. The rare earth elements The rare earth elements include 15 elements (Z= 57 through 71) and Yttrium (Z= 39) and scandium. Because of their reactivity and similarity, the REEs were found to be difficult to obtain [...] Lanthanide elements with a low atomic number are generally more abundant in the earth crust than those with high atomic numbers. World demand for rare earth elements is estimated by Humphries (CRS Report for Congress) at 134. 000 tons per year, with the global production of around 114. 000 tons annually. Humphries has reported in 2010 that there is no rare earth mine production in the United States. The major uses for rare earth elements include applications in auto catalysts, petroleum refining, metal alloys, cell phones, portable DVDs, etc. Permanent magnets containing neodymium, gadolinium and dysprosium are used in numerous electrical components and generators for wind turbines. The primary defense application (underwater mine detection, satellite power and communication systems, radar systems,etc.) use new materials: Neodymium Iron Boron, Samarium Cobalt. REEs extraction from monazite is performed by dissolution in a hot concentrated base or acid solutions. After cooling, the hydroxides of REEs and thorium are recovered by filtration, and thorium is separated by dissolution and selective precipitation. Metallurgy of indium   Indium belongs to the group of rare earth elements with a low melting point. Some addition of indium increases the strength, hardness and corrosion resistance of alloys. The most known producers are situated in Belgium, Canada, Russia, France and Japan. Indium is used as coating on metals applied in difficult operation conditions, and in semiconductor techniques for the production of diodes. It is formed as a semi-product after pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical treatment of sulphidic raw materials. Indium can be used with other valuable metals such as vanadium, thallium, gallium, germanium, and cadmium. The coating process based on Indium is performed by an electrolytic treatment on the surface.   Metallurgy of yttrium Yttrium compounds found interesting application in many fields. In particular, yttrium is used in the manufacture of superconductors, in super alloys of nickel and cobalt, and solid oxide fuel cells. Yttrium oxide has a high melting point and is used in ceramics. The compounds of yttrium are also used as catalysts. The growing industrial application of the rare earth elements led to a growing interest in finding new technologies for their recoveries. The selective dissolution of yttrium from lanthanum is performed by ammonium carbonate leaching. Conclusion The EU <b>Raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>Initiative</b> was decided to identify a list of critical raw materials at the EU level. The EU-report describes a selection of 41 minerals and metals. Then, 14 elements were chosen as critical materials fort the economy of the European countries in the next twenty years. The future use of REEs is expected to be increased in the European countries. About 90 % of metal alloys are produced in China. The price of rare earth elements is reduced for the consumers in China in comparison to some companies in the USA and Europe. Therefore, the European countries and the USA have protested against this situation. The selective winning of rare earth elements is the most important aim in the processing of raw materials. The combination of pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical methods might be a new way of solving this problem in the European countries. </div...|$|E
40|$|After {{its debut}} in the European Commission’s Integrated Product Policy (COM (2003) 302) as the “best {{framework}} for assessing the potential environmental impacts of products”, Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) and Assessment (LCA) has become increasingly used in support of community policies and business. Focus has been primarily on establishing agreed methods, both within Europe and internationally. The EC’s European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment (EPLCA) has continued to address the equally essential issue of data availability, coherence, and quality assurance. LCA has become an important approach to boost smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the EU. As an example, {{in the context of}} the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative “A Resource Efficient Europe”, and the “Single Market for Green Products Communication” and related European Commission Recommendation for the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) Guide and the Organisation Environmental Footprint (OEF) Guides. These methodologies reflect a vital milestone in the aim to increase coherence and quality in the assessment of environmental performance of products and organisations. Other prominent applications include in support of the Waste Framework Directive, the Eco-design Directive, EU Ecolabel and EU GPP, the <b>Raw</b> <b>Materials</b> <b>Initiative,</b> the bio economy strategy, as well as providing a more advanced basis for indicators and targets accounting for the burdens of EU imports and exports to help focus policies and research funding. Life Cycle Thinking is essential in modern decision making in business and policy. Commonly implemented through Life Cycle Assessment, it is increasingly necessary to quantify the benefits and burdens associated with products, both goods and services, that occur in their supply chains, during use, as well as at the end-of-their lives. This helps to avoid the shifting of burdens between different geographic regions, generations and impacts. Within this framework, the EPLCA, developed by the JRC, together with DG-Environment, represents the reference point for data and methods essential to implementing Life Cycle based approaches. The EPLCA promotes the availability of data and information, with a focus on coherence and quality assurance. Although methodology development is advancing fast, the availability of coherent, quality-assured life cycle data and studies still represents a major challenge to mainstream the use of LCA and associated environmental footprint methods in business and in policy. To date, the EPLCA has facilitated several notable developments: -	The Life Cycle Data Network (LCDN); launched in early 2014, aims at providing a globally usable infrastructure for consistent and quality assured life cycle data. -	The European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD); comprises of Life Cycle emissions and resource consumption Inventory (LCI) data from front-running EU-level business associations and other sources for key materials, energy carriers, transport, and waste management, to be used as source for secondary data. -	The Resource Directory (RD); provides a structured repository for several types of life cycle-based documents and studies, as well as a world-wide list of life cycle support software packages and databases from suppliers/developers, and service providers. -	The Reviewer Registry (RR) : provides a list of potential reviewers for different LCA schemes, and automatically assess the eligibility of single reviewers and reviewers’ teams, according to different levels of compliance. This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to utilize the Life Cycle Data Network (LCDN) for publishing LCA data. It summarizes how to orchestrate the various tools in order to guide the data developers through the entire process from generation of a dataset to publication on the LCDN. Further and more detailed documentation for the individual steps can be found in the annexes to this technical report. In principle, the following steps are required in order to publish data on the LCDN and therefore covered in this document: 1. 	Prepare data (export from an LCA modelling tool) 2. 	Technical validation of the data 3. 	Set up a node for participation in the LCDN. 4. 	Upload of the data to the node 5. 	Publication of the data on the LCDN Beyond that, a detailed guidance on how document different ILCD-EL aspects, in three commonly used LCA software in Europe (Namely: GaBi, OpenLCA and SimaPro), is also provided in this document. This document is providing some examples, taking into account some the above mentioned LCA software, because are the most commonly used and widespread in Europe, this does NOT imply any recommendation or endorsement from the JRC or the European Commission. An exemplary dataset was used to provide an overview and understanding of how to address some compliance issues, in different software. Some general guiding principles that apply to all of the software are summarized, along with a short review of discrepancies found when exporting the dataset in ILCD format using the individual LCA software.

To date, the European Platform has facilitated several notable developments: - The International Reference Life Cycle Data System Data Network (ILCD DN); to be launched in early 2014, aims at providing a globally usable infrastructure for consistent and quality assured life cycle data. - The European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD); comprises of Life Cycle emissions and resource consumption Inventory (LCI) data from front-running EU-level business associations and other sources for key materials, energy carriers, transport, and waste management, to be used as source for secondary data. - The International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Handbook; is a series of technical guidance documents that provide practice-oriented guidance on LCA; providing a key input to the Environmental Footprint developments, as well as complementary support in relation to data and other application needs. - The Resource Directory (RD); provides a structured repository for several types of life cycle-based documents and studies, as well as a world-wide list of life cycle support software packages and databases from suppliers/developers, and service providers. - The Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) Forum; acts as reference point for scholars and practitioners to discuss and share experiences on methods, data, events, etc. This tool is expected to be revised and released as a structured online public forum in the near future, in order to facilitate topic-oriented information exchange. - The Advisory Groups with business stakeholders and software developers; aim at improving the usefulness of the European Platform in the EU and international context, towards the agreement on common strategies and harmonisation. Although a lot of work has been already done, there are still several bottlenecks preventing the Platform to effectively and efficiently meet the growing needs of policy makers and other stakeholders. Seeking for synergies among tools, improving transparency and consistency of data, and populating the ELCD and ILCD DN with new relevant data are just a few examples of further development necessities. This Roadmap provides an overview of what would be required to further improve and best position the European Platform on LCA in relation to a selection of key on-going EC policy support activities required to facilitate environmental sustainability. The Roadmap specifies a number of action proposals. These actions are differentiated in the Roadmap in terms of time frame (i. e. short-mid-term describing circa 3 years starting from 2014, while the longer-term perspective represents a vision for the future evolution). Based on the availability of resources, three scenarios have been delineated to undertake to various extents these actions. In short, the first scenario assumes minor changes to the current resource availability. This scenario would address only the most important needs, detected as transversal across the different EU projects and policies involved, including only the strictly necessary improvements. According to the second scenario, slightly increased investments will be needed. Given the current situation, this scenario seems to be the minimum-effort scenario to improve the Platform in a timely manner. This scenario entails, among others, the expansion of the data and information support tools needed to e. g. ensure the smooth implementation of the Environmental Footprint method; amongst other policy and business support needs of the community. With major additional investment into the Platform, very important goals could be achieved in a fast-track manner. Through this third scenario, the Platform could become the most important reference point for all the life cycle based activities in the EU, facilitating interactions among stakeholders, policy makers and practitioners, and creating synergies for data exchange between the European Commission, other EU institutions, member-states and other non-governmental organizations. edition: 1 nrpages: 67 status: publishe...|$|E
