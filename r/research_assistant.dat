40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} science perceptions of the <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> as early career academics. For this aim the questionnaire composing three main parts was conducted to 347 <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> from a state university in Turkey. The findings of the study revealed that the <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> generally have strong interest to their academic fields. Another important finding was that <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> have a pragmatic approach toward the idea of science. Results also pointed out that majority of the <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> consider themselves as an intellectual on science. The results of this study are expected to enhance scientific culture at universities by revealing the current science perception among <b>research</b> <b>assistants.</b> © 2013 IOJES.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the employment conditions of <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> in {{universities in the}} context of the stated intention of the Australian government to transfonn Australia into the 2 ̆ 7 clever country 2 ̆ 7. <b>Research</b> <b>assistants</b> have played an important role in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s research efforts. The growing teaching and administrative workloads of academic staff. and the increasing sophistication and complexity of research methodologies. have increased the demands on <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> and the importance of their contribution. Despite this. there has been little improvement in the employment conditions of <b>research</b> <b>assistants.</b> These conditions include the absence of any job security; lack of career structure and development: and insufficient recognition of qualifications. experience and skills. <b>Research</b> <b>assistants</b> have no common career structure. some being employed under academic staff conditions. others under general staff conditions and some as neither. Union coverage of <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> is divided between several unions. making effective representation difficult. The rules of the funding agenCies. the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Council are inconsistent with award conditions of <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> which specify that prior experience must be taken into account when determining initial salary levels. These sub-standard employment conditions act as deterrents to talented researchers undertaking or continuing careers in research. and thus undermine Australia 2 ̆ 7 s research effort. The reports of several government inquiries into university research activity are analysed. and are found to be inadequately researched and to provide no solutions to the problems outlined. Suggestions for the provision of a viable career structure for researchers are prOVided. It is concluded that the development of Australia as a 2 ̆ 7 clever country 2 ̆ 7 depends to a large extent on research workers becoming more actively involved in the promotion of improved conditions of employment...|$|R

He then gave the vaccine to three thousand children. Many of these children developed allergic reactions, but none developed immunity to polio. Philadelphia pathologist John Kolmer also claimed to have developed a vaccine that same year, but it too produced no immunity and was blamed for causing cases of paralytic polio, nine of them fatal.|$|E
