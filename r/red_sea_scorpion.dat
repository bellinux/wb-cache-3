50|$|The genus {{was created}} in 1910 by Henry who {{described}} Haemohormidium cotti in short spined <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> (Myxocephalus scorpius) and the long spined <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> (Taurulus bubalis).

5000|$|Megalograptus (Greek for [...] "big writing") is a 4 ft Ordovician {{eurypterid}} (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpion),</b> and {{was among}} the earliest known genera (and {{was a member of}} the family Megalograptidae). The generic name is derived from the fact that its first fossils were of its very spiny legs, which were mistaken for massive graptolites. It lived from 460 to 445 mya. Megalograptus preyed on fish, trilobites, other <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions,</b> and smaller orthocones, using the spines on their claws to feel for their prey hiding in the sand and mud. Adult Cameroceras, along with the bigger <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> species, preyed on it. Megalograptus did not have a stinger, but may have curled its tail and sword-like telson forward as a threat pose, much like a scorpion.|$|R
50|$|Hibbertopterus is a genus {{of giant}} <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> (order Eurypterida) that {{inhabited}} the swamps of Scotland during the Carboniferous.|$|R
50|$|Fossils of Pterygotus are {{relatively}} common, although complete skeletons are rare. It {{was one of}} the last of the gigantic sea scorpions: later species were much smaller and more nimble. The decline of the larger <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions</b> may be related to their relative slowness and possible vulnerability during moulting, since they could not escape to land like smaller <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions.</b> However, the latter is unlikely since Pterygotus was such a large creature.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the contents of body fat and amino acid contents in flesh of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream (Pagrus major) cultured in Yosu, Korea, and Nagasaki, Japan. In view of this purpose, body length and weight, Rohrer and T. M. indexes, body fat and its fatty acid contents, and amino acid contents were investigated. Body length and weight of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream cultured in Japan were significantly higher than those cultured in Korea. Obese degree estimated by Rohrer and T. M. indexes of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream cultured in Japan were obviously higher than those cultured in Korea. The content of body fat estimated by T. M. index of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream cultured in Japan was higher about two times than those cultured in Korea. The contents of essential fatty acids were high in <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream cultured in Japan, while ω- 3 PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) contents and ω- 3 /ω- 6 ratio were high in those cultured in Korea. The contents of essential amino acids in <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream were higher in Japan than in Korea, but there was no significant differences between total amino acid contents of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream cultured in both Korea and Japan...|$|R

50|$|Horseshoe crabs were {{traditionally}} grouped {{with the}} extinct eurypterids (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpions)</b> as the Merostomata. They may have {{evolved in the}} shallow seas of the Paleozoic Era (570-248 million years ago) with other primitive arthropods like the trilobites.

50|$|Until a {{few decades}} ago it was thought that Palaeophonus, {{similarly}} to many other scorpions of the Silurian, was one of the earliest animals to have conquered the land.

40|$|Most histopathologycal {{studies of}} the <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream iridovirus (RSIV) disease in red sea bream have been {{performed}} by studying enlarged cells as well as necrotized cells in the spleen and other organs. These enlarged cells have been named as inclusion body bearing cells (IBCs). However, few information is available about detail of ultrastructural features of IBCs produced in the target organs of RSIV-infected fish.  In the present study, details of ultrastructural features of IBCs that were produced in the spleen tissue of naturally RSIV-infected <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream were investigated under electron microscope. Under electron microscope, RSIV-infected <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream had the presence of two types of IBCs: typical IBCs allowing virus assembly within viral assembly site (VAS), and atypical IBCs which degenerate organelles without virus assembly. Other infected-cells were observed as necrotized cells forming intracytoplasmic VAS {{with large numbers of}} virions, but without the formation of the distinct inclusion body. Morphogenesis steps on RSIV-infected <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream were observed as filamentous-filed virions, partially-filled virions and complete virions with 145 - 150 nm in size. These findings confirmed that RSIV-infected <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream were characterized by formation of typical and atypical IBCs as well as necrotized cells...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream （av. body wt. 1. 4 g） {{and black}} sea bream （av. body wt. 0. 5 g） were fed two {{purified}} casein based diets containing. 0. 34 ％ (control) and 0. 03 % （unsupplemented) dietary calcium （Ca） for 10 weeks at 27. 0 ± 1. 4 ℃. Final body weight, condition factor and hepatosomatic index were {{not affected by}} dietary Ca in both species. Feed effciency in black sea bream was almost same between two dietary groups, however, feed efficiency in <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream fed the Ca unsupplemented diet were slightly lower than that in fish fed the control diet. Dietary Ca levels did not affect blood characteristics of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream and black sea bream. In both species Ca and other mineral contents of the bone were independent of a dietary Ca supplement except that K and Mn contents of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream fed the Ca unsupplemented diet were significantly lower {{than those in the}} control.

5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the Chelicerata contain the classes Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.), Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpions,</b> extinct). The extinct Chasmataspida may be a sub-group within Eurypterida. The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) were traditionally classified as chelicerates, but some features suggest they may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well-known groups such as chelicerates evolved.|$|R

40|$|A {{laboratory}} based 2 x 3 {{factorial experiment}} was conducted for 12 weeks {{to investigate the}} influences of dietary lipid and phosphorus (P) levels on retention and excretion of phosphorus and nitrogen (N) in fingerling <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream. Two levels of lipid (210 and 260 g/kg) and three levels of phosphorus (17, 14 and 12 g/kgˉ¹) in the dry diets were tested. Duplicate groups of 25 <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream (average weight 3. 74 ± 0. 07 g) per 60 L glass tank were fed experimental diets {{three times a day}} near to satiation level at 22 to 28 °C water temperature. A reduction in dietary fish meal from 500 to 300 g/kg dry diet, corresponding to a supplementation in both dietary lipid and P resulted in significant increase in both P and N retention which resulted in the reduction of their excretion by <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream. The overall {{results of the present study}} demonstrated that both lipid and phosphorus supplementation are necessary for developing less-polluting feed which in turn, reduce fish meal level in the diet of fingerling <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream. Further studies in this regard with different size and age groups of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream are warranted...|$|R
