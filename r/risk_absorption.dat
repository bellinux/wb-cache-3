(2) A canine model with bilateral vesicoureteral reflux and elevated bladder pressures (> 40 cmH 2 O) assessed the effects of reflux and storage pressure.

(4) To determine the effects of storage conditions, solutions of gentamicin sulfate (480 mg gentamicin sulfate in 1 L 0. 9 % NaCI) were made that controlled for pH, storage temperature, and duration. Results. (1) Increased absorption was found in 43 percent of rat serum samples. (2) None of the dogs demonstrated measurable absorption. (3) None of the patients likewise had measurable absorption.

40|$|The recent Global Financial Crisis {{started as}} {{a crisis in the}} US sub-prime {{mortgage}} market, and rapidly spread to a wider financial crisis. This article suggests that beyond the crisis, we can now see that households are playing an evolving role as a site of <b>risk</b> <b>absorption.</b> In so doing, households have become a frontier of capital accumulation, not just as producers and consumers, but also as financial traders. Households are increasingly buying financialized products as an ordinary part of daily subsistence - houses, insurance, education, electricity and mobile phones. But at a level beyond the household&# 039;s daily reality, these regular purchases are being re-specified as assets, on which asset backed securities are built and then traded. It is in this way that by securitizing mortgage debt, finance has given global liquidity to housing. The size of securitized markets on housing as well as household assets and payment streams now dwarfs stock markets. The requirements of this emergent financial citizenship for the house and households extend beyond just honouring payments on a home purchase, it is requiring a culture of financial calculation that becomes absorbed as part of the daily norms and dispositions of social being. The presumption of rights of access to housing, education and health care are being replaced by the acceptance of individual financial participation and calculation.

The results of the impact studies indicate that considerable socio-economic benefits have been accruing to small-scale farming households, rural micro entrepreneurs and the landless and have contributed to most impact aspects of MDGs 1 to 6. Most SHG members substantially increase their saving rates. A shift has been observed over time from consumption loans to loans for income generating purposes. Increased savings and capital formation improve the self-financing capacities and even out the household?s cash flow. This in turn has improved their <b>risk</b> <b>absorption</b> capacity and made them less vulnerable. Access to formal finance has substantially reduced dependency on money lenders and has diminished capital costs. The improved access to financial services has benefited SHG members and their households in maintaining, intensifying and diversifying their economic activities, with positive effects on income and employment generation, especially in the non-agricultural sector. The unprecedented scale of SHG banking and its enormous potential for further growth, within India and without, raises the question as to the dynamics of its evolution, the forces behind it, and the contribution of external organizations.

40|$|The correct {{measure and}} {{definition}} of liquidity in finance literature remains an unresolved empirical issue. The main {{objective of the}} present study was to develop, validate and test the liquidity mismatch index (LMI) developed by Brunnermeier, Krishnamurthy and Gorton (2012) empirically. Building on the work of these prior studies, the study undertook to develop a measure of liquidity that integrates both market liquidity and funding liquidity within a context of asset liability management. Liquidity mismatch indices were developed and then tested empirically to validate them by regressing them against the known determinants of liquidity. Furthermore, the study investigated the nexus between liquidity and profitability. The unit of analysis was a panel of 12 South African banks over the period 2005 – 2015. The study developed two liquidity measures – the bank liquidity mismatch index (BLMI) and the aggregate liquidity mismatch index (ALMI) – whose performances were compared to and contrasted with the Basel III liquidity measures and traditional liquidity measures using a generalised method of moments (GMM) model. Overall, the two constructed liquidity indices performed better than other liquidity measures. Significantly, the ALMI provided a better macro-prudential liquidity measure that can be utilised in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, thus presenting a major contribution to the body of knowledge. Unlike the LMI, the BLMI and ALMI can be used to evaluate the liquidity of a given bank under liquidity stress events, which are scaled by theoretically motivated and empirically supported liquidity weights. The constructed BLMI contains information regarding the liquidity risk within the context of asset liability mismatches, and the measure used comprehensive data from bank balance sheets and from financial market measures. The newly developed liquidity measures are based on portfolio management theory as they account for the significance of liquidity spirals. Empirical results show that banks increase their liquidity buffers during times of turmoil as both BLMI and ALMI improved during the period 2007 – 2009. Subsequently, the improvement in economic performance resulted in a rise in ALMI but a decrease in BLMI. We found no evidence to support the theory that banks, which heavily depend on external funding, end up in serious liquidity problems. The findings imply that any policy implemented with the intention of increasing bank capital is good for bank liquidity since the financial fragility–crowding-out hypothesis is outweighed by the <b>risk</b> <b>absorption</b> hypothesis because the relationship between capital and bank liquidity is positive.

However, for lack of dynamic mathematical model analysis methods for reflecting the changes of annulus liquid level in the borehole during the “Hang's Mudding-off” operation, the actual operation is basically conducted blindly without reasonable engineering basis.
