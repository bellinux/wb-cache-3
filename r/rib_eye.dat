5|$|Inconsistent {{inheritance}} of myostatin mutations (for example, F94L in Limousins, nt821 in Angus, and Q204X in Charolais) by progeny {{is expected to}} result in possible BLUP prediction errors for EBVs and EPDs equalling or exceeding worst case standard errors of prediction. For example, average <b>rib</b> <b>eye</b> area for Limousins in US Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) trials during the 1980s and early 1990s {{is reported to be}} 12.3in2, and the reported possible difference in <b>rib</b> <b>eye</b> area in progeny arising from {{inheritance of}} either two F94L mutations or two normal myostatin genes from heterozygous parents is estimated to be 1.8in2 (12.3in2 x 15%). This difference, which is unpredictable without DNA testing, is nearly four times the possible change value for a 0% BIF accuracy, reported to be 0.46in2 for the <b>rib</b> <b>eye</b> EPD.|$|E
5|$|When {{one parent}} is {{heterozygous}} for the mutation, {{and the other}} homozygous for the mutation or the normal form of the myostatin gene, the expected average difference in <b>rib</b> <b>eye</b> area of progeny will be about 0.9in2 (12.3in2 x 7.5%), {{depending on whether the}} mutation or normal form of the gene is inherited from the heterozygous parent.

5000|$|Dry-aged beef is beef {{that has}} been hung or placed on a rack to dry for several weeks. After the animal is {{slaughtered}} and cleaned, it is hung as a full or half carcass. Primal (large distinct sections) or sub primal cuts, such as strip loins, <b>rib</b> <b>eyes,</b> and sirloin, are placed in a refrigerator unit, {{also known as a}} [...] "hot box". This process involves considerable expense, as the beef must be stored near freezing temperatures. Subprimal cuts can be dry aged on racks either in specially climate-controlled coolers or within a moisture-permeable drybag. Moreover, only the higher grades of meat can be dry aged, as the process requires meat with a large, evenly distributed fat content. Because of this, dry-aged beef is seldom available outside of steak restaurants and upscale butcher shops or groceries. The key effect of dry aging is the concentration and saturation of the natural flavour, as well as the tenderization of the meat texture.|$|R

5|$|A Limousin/Jersey {{backcross}} {{study conducted}} in Australia and New Zealand {{to investigate the}} effects of the F94L myostatin variant concluded that the mutation had no significant effect on birth-weight and growth traits. Averaged over all backcross calves in the trial (total of 766), animals homozygous for the mutation had approximately 6% heavier carcases than animals without the mutation, 15% larger eye muscle (also known as <b>rib</b> <b>eye)</b> area, 13% heavier silverside weight, and 13% heavier total meat weight. Increased meat weight and size was accompanied by a 15% reduction in intra-muscular fat and 25% reduction in total fat weight. No other significant effects were observed. A second backcross study conducted in Japan of Limousin and Japanese Black breeds identified similar changes to meat and fat quantities in cattle homozygous for the F94L mutation.|$|E
5|$|The USMARC study {{indicated}} that Limousins were significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market end points of two measures of marbling score (70 to 160 days longer than the British breeds, and 65 to 70 days longer than the other continental European breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was marginally poorer (12% less than the British breeds and comparable with the other continental European breeds). When feed conversion efficiency is adjusted to weight of saleable meat divided by feed consumed, Limousin feed conversion efficiency then exceeds both British and continental European breeds by 10–25%. The USMARC study also indicated that Limousins were very significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market specifications of three measures of <b>rib</b> <b>eye</b> fat (300 to 400 days longer than the British breeds, and 170 to 220 days longer than the other continental European breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was poorer (25–30% less than the British breeds and 12–16% less than the other continental European breeds). When corrected to saleable meat divided by feed consumed, feed conversion efficiency was similar or marginally better for Limousins. At these end points, Limousins finished at markedly heavier live weights (up to 490kg heavier than the British breeds, and 190kg heavier than the other continental European breeds).|$|E

40|$|Sow {{productive}} lifetime {{continues to}} challenge U. S. commercial swine herds and worldwide pork operations in general. The increased prevalence of hoof abnormalities (e. g. hoof and dew claw overgrowth, hoof wall cracks, and foot pad abrasions) in cull sow populations observed at harvest lend {{evidence to the}} hypothesis that these abnormalities are detrimental to sow performance. The objectives of this thesis were four-fold. The first objective was to summarize sow behaviors associated with increased sow welfare productive lifetime, specifically maintenance (feed and drink), social (aggression, sow-piglet interaction, and expression of sexual behaviors), and stereotypical behaviors. Results from this review suggest that detrimental behaviors were stereotypical behaviors such as bar bitting, aggression between sows through lower feed intake, aggression toward caretakers, and piglet savaging and cannibalism. The second objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of excessive toe growth, presence of cracks in the outer hoof wall, and the difference in length between the medial and lateral toe of the hoof on lactation performance and sow behavior in mid-lactation. This study concluded that sows with overgrown toes stand less than sows with normal hooves, and those findings are consistent with other studies. Sows were observed standing and eating between 3. 3 and 9. 1 % of the observation period, and, of the variables collected, eating was the primary activity performed while standing. Post feeding, each OG lesion score increase was associated with a 40. 0 % decrease in time spent standing and eating. This observation held true for total time spent standing and eating during the observation period [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0. 45]. Results from this study demonstrate that foot lesions can impair productivity and behavior of lactating sows. The degree to which foot lesions impair production and behavior is dependent on lesion type and severity. The third objective {{of this study was to}} estimate observer accuracy and repeatability of body condition scoring sows when scorers have different levels of prior experience. Participants body condition scores were positively associated with body condition scores (BCS) derived by backfat measurements. Averaging over all participants, the ultrasonic trait of last rib backfat yielded the greatest correlation (0. 58) with BCS using a 9 -pt scale, followed by tenth rib backfat (0. 51), tenth <b>rib</b> loin <b>eye</b> area (0. 47), and last <b>rib</b> loin <b>eye</b> area (0. 43). Similar trends were observed for the BCS 5 scale. Therefore, practice assigning independent BCS should lower repeatability variance, but training to calibrate specific participants may only influence total test variance to a relatively small degree. The final objective of this study was to estimate the amount of feed and associated costs of adding body weight to cull sows, in an evaluation to improve producer profitability. Adding BW to cull sows could be profitable in the presence of $ 0. 11 / kg feed prices and labor and housing costs of $ 0. 25 / d per sow...|$|R

40|$|The blind Mexican cave tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, is {{a unique}} model system {{for the study of}} {{parallelism}} and the evolution of cave-adapted traits. Understanding the genetic basis for these traits has recently become feasible thanks to production of a genome-wide linkage map and quantitative trait association analyses. The selection of suitable candidate genes controlling quantitative traits remains challenging, however, {{in the absence of a}} physical genome. Here, we describe the integration of multiple linkage maps generated in four separate crosses between surface, cave, and hybrid forms of A. mexicanus. We performed exhaustive BLAST analyses of genomic markers populating this integrated map against sequenced genomes of numerous taxa, ranging from yeast to amniotes. We found the largest number of identified sequences (228), with the most expect (E) values < 10 − 5 (95), in the zebrafish Danio rerio. The most significant hits were assembled into an “anchored” linkage map with Danio, revealing numerous regions of conserved synteny, many of which are shared across critical regions of identified quantitative trait loci (QTL). Using this anchored map, we predicted the positions of 21 test genes on the integrated linkage map and verified that 18 of these are found in locations homologous to their chromosomal positions in D. rerio. The anchored map allowed the identification of four candidate genes for QTL relating to <b>rib</b> number and <b>eye</b> size.

3000|$|... von Recklinghausen’s {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} dominant disease first described by von Recklinghausen’s in 1882 [3]. The major clinical features include multiple neurofibromas and café au lait {{spots in the}} skin. The other common clinical features include deformity of the spinal column and <b>rib</b> cage, <b>eye</b> disease, and neural tumor of the central nervous system. The incidence is about one in 3000 to 4000 live births. Although von Recklinghausen’s disease is a genetic disorder, only about 30  % of patients {{have a family history}} of the condition. Mutations in the rest of the patients (about 70  %) appear to be spontaneous mutations [4]. Broadly, tumors arising from chromaffin tissue in the sympathetic ganglia are referred to as pheochromocytomas, although strictly speaking, only those of adrenal origin are pheochromocytomas, whereas those of extra-adrenal origin are paragangliomas. Paragangliomas occur more commonly in the retroperitoneum, accounting for 1.8 to 2.1  % of all retroperitoneal tumors [5 – 7]. A study reported that 14 to 50  % of retroperitoneal paragangliomas are malignant [8]. Evidence suggests that the prevalence of pheochromocytoma (those of adrenal origin) in patients with von Recklinghausen’s disease is relatively high [9, 10]. According to a study by Walther et al., the incidence was 0.1 to 5.7  % [11], considered to be approximately 10 times higher than that in healthy controls. On the other hand, the occurrence of paraganglioma in patients with von Recklinghausen’s disease is very rare. According to a study by Takayama et al. [12] in 2001, only five cases have been reported in Japan. Given that no additional case reports have been published since then, this is indeed an extremely rare condition. To the best of our knowledge, the reason why pheochromocytoma develops more frequently than paraganglioma in patients with von Recklinghausen’s disease has not been reported. Furthermore, there are no reported von Recklinghausen’s disease cases of the resection of liver metastases long after the initial primary paraganglioma resection. Actually, considering the long interval between resection of the retroperitoneal paraganglioma to the identification of the liver tumors, there may be a possibility that the paragangliomas in the liver were primarily arising from liver. However, as mentioned below, the long interval is not uncommon in cases with liver metastasis from retroperitoneal paraganglioma. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports regarding primary liver paraganglioma. At last, the histopathological findings of the extra-adrenal retroperitoneal paraganglioma and liver paragangliomas were similar. Taken together, the liver tumors in the case were judged as metastases from the extra-adrenal retroperitoneal lesion. We, therefore, considered the von Recklinghausen’s disease case particularly important.|$|R
