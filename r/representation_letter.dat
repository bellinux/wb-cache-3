S. government to the President and the Congress. We are required to audit these consolidated financial statements (CFS) and report {{on the results of}} our work. In connection with fulfilling our requirement to audit the fiscal year 2004 CFS, we evaluated the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) financial reporting procedures and related internal control over the process for compiling the CFS, including the management <b>representation</b> <b>letter</b> provided us by Treasury and OMB. Written representation letters from management, required by U. S. generally accepted government auditing standards, ordinarily confirm oral representations given to the auditor, indicate and document the continuing appropriateness of those representations, and reduce the possibility of a misunderstanding between management and the auditor. The purpose of this report is to communicate our observations on the Department of Commerce's (DOC) fiscal year 2004 management <b>representation</b> <b>letter.</b> Our objective is to help ensure that future management representation letters submitted by DOC are sufficient to help support Treasury and OMB's preparation of the CFS management <b>representation</b> <b>letter</b> and our ability to rely on the representations in that letter in combination with individual federal agency representation letters. We reviewed five key areas in each management representation letter: (1) signatures, (2) materiality thresholds, (3) representations, (4) summary of unadjusted misstatements, and (5) reliability of representations. In reviewing the management representation letters, we applied the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) Codification of Auditing Standards, AU Section 333, Management Representations; OMB Bulletin 01 - 02, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements; and the GAO/President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) Financial Audit Manual (FAM) section 1001, entitled "Management Representations.

40|$|Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 121 {{is a new}} {{standard}} devoted {{to the issue of}} impairment of long-lived assets. Impairment loss occurs when the carrying amount is not expected to be recovered. When SFAS 121 was issued, early adoption was suggested but not required for fiscal years beginning before December 15, 1995. Although there are some similarities, the standard sets some different rules for assets "to be held and used" and assets "to be disposed of" Since the standard does not identify a materiality level, it remains at the discretion of management. This paper first discusses the requirements of SFAS 121. Then a sample of companies is analyzed to determine compliance with the {{new standard}}. A sample of 25 companies was chosen from the CD-ROM Disclosure Software. The sample was analyzed and compared on a list of items to identify relationship between the items and to identify if, how and when companies plan to comply with SFAS 121. Some of the items noted were year ends, early adoption of SFAS 121, type of impairment, discussion in the management <b>representation</b> <b>letter</b> and discussion in the footnotes to the financial statements.

40|$|Auditing {{standards}} {{require an}} auditor to make various enquiries about liabilities in general this may entail consideration of potential litigations and {{claims that the}} audited entity may be facing. To perform this part of audit, the auditors will generally seek representation letters from lawyers of the company detailing an estimate prepared by management, confirmed by their lawyers through a <b>representation</b> <b>letter,</b> and then sent directly to the auditors. This paper reviews the implications for the auditing profession of a case that involved auditors seeking such representation letters. The case involves litigation between the Westpac Banking Corporation and 789 TEN Pty Ltd. While the Westpac case confirmed the legal position of the auditor in their task of collecting evidence in order to form an opinion in Australia, it highlights a significant anomaly under the law and should place the issue of solicitor’s representation letters as audit evidence firmly {{on the agenda of}} policymakers. This issue of the compromise of legal privilege during the conduct of an audit is also not confined to Australia: other common law jurisdictions, such as the UK and the US, have also sought to clarify the position of auditors when issues of the integrity of legal privacy privilege arise...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:Behavioral and neuropsychological {{research}} {{in reading and}} spelling has provided evidence {{for the role of}} the following types of orthographic <b>representations</b> in <b>letter</b> writing: letter forms, letter case, and abstract letter identities. We report on the results of an fMRI investigation designed to identify the neural substrates of these different representational types. Using a neural adaptation paradigm we examined the neural distribution of inhibition and release from inhibition in a letter-writing task in which, on every trial, participants produced three repetitions of the same letter and a fourth letter that was either identical to (no-change trial) or different from the previous three (change trial). Change trials involved a change in the shape, case and/or identity of the letter. After delineating the general letter writing network by identifying areas that exhibited significant neural adaptation effects on no-change trials, we used deconvolution analysis to examine this network for effects of release from inhibition on change trials. In this way we identified regions specifically associated with the <b>representation</b> of <b>letter</b> shape (left SFS and SFG/pre-CG) and letter identity (left fusiform gyrus) or both (cerebellum, post-central gyrus and middle frontal gyrus). No regions were associated with the <b>representation</b> of <b>letter</b> case.

40|$|We {{report the}} case of ET, a 7 -year-old child with a severe {{developmental}} letter-processing impairment. Detailed assessment revealed multiple impairments of the letter-processing system affecting abstract visual <b>letter</b> <b>representation,</b> semantics, and connections between the phonological processing modules and the orthographic buffer. Treatment methods focused on letter sounding through development of abstract visual representation and semantic <b>representation</b> of <b>letters.</b> Treatment resulted in dramatic and enduring improvements in cross-case matching, letter/number categorization, and letter sounding. Cognitive neuropsychological reading research has largely focused on word processing, with a relative neglect of single-letter processing. The current study investigated letter processing in greater detail than has been usual and outlines a broad theoretical framework for letter processing. ET's assessment and treatment data are used to support and question predictions from the framework. A number of theoretical implications are discussed with reference to ET's data and that of other reported cases of impaired single-letter processing. Finally, the paucity of investigation of letter processing in children is highlighted, {{particularly with regard to}} integrity of abstract <b>letter</b> <b>representation</b> in developmental dyslexia. 27 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{computational}} modelling {{of reading}} {{has been much}} pursued in the past twenty years, and several specific computational models of visual word recognition and reading aloud have been developed. These models offer computational accounts of many aspects of reading, but all have neglected {{the front end of}} the reading process, saying essentially nothing about how early visual processes operate during reading and little about how the nature of <b>letter</b> <b>representations</b> and how these are activated from print. This volume aims to begin to redress this neglect of {{the front end of the}} reading system. The first three articles address issues of letter perception: i. e. how <b>letter</b> <b>representations</b> are activated from their visual features. The remaining four articles address the nature of the <b>letter</b> <b>representations</b> themselves, from functional, developmental and neural perspectives. These articles introduce novel and interesting ways to investigate the very earliest stages of the reading process. The research reported here will stimulate future investigations of this highly tractable, yet long overlooked, area of reading research. In particular, it should assist attempts to develop computational models of reading to make more realistic proposals about the actual computations involved in the activation of <b>letter</b> <b>representations</b> from print. 127 page(s...|$|R

A relatively preserved ability to match lowercase to uppercase letters suggests partially spared access to abstract letter identities independently of their visual forms. The patient was also unable to match spoken letters and numbers to their visual form, indicating that she could not access the graphemic <b>representations</b> of <b>letters</b> from their phonological representations.

40|$|According to {{a recent}} hypothesis, the CV pattern (i. e. the {{arrangement}} of consonant and vowel letters) constrains the mental <b>representation</b> of <b>letter</b> strings, with each vowel or vowel cluster being {{the core of a}} unit. Six experiments with the same/different task were conducted to test whether this structure is extracted prelexically. In the mismatching trials, the targets were pseudowords built by the transposition of 2 adjacent letters from base words. In one condition, the pseudowords had the same number of vowel clusters as the base word, whereas in another condition, the transposition modified the number of vowel clusters (e. g. poirver: 2 vowel clusters vs. povirer: 3 vowel clusters, from POIVRER: 2 vowel clusters). In Experiment 1, pseudowords with a different number of vowel clusters were more quickly processed than pseudowords preserving the CV structure of their base word. Experiment 2 further showed that this effect was not due to changes in syllabic structure. In Experiment 3, the pattern of results was also replicated when the category (consonant or vowel) of the transposed letters was strictly equated between conditions. Experiments 4 and 5 confirmed that the effects were not attributable to lexical processing, to differences in letter identity, or to the position of transpositions. The results suggest that the orthographic <b>representation</b> of <b>letter</b> strings is influenced by the CV pattern at an early, prelexical processing stage. © 2014 American Psychological Association.
