5|$|Most of the <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> {{endometrial cancer}} involve {{high levels of}} estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E
25|$|The {{consumption}} {{of saturated fat}} is generally considered a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> dyslipidemia, {{which in turn is}} a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> some types of cardiovascular disease.|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of contraindications, {{patients}} with atrial fibrillation {{and at least one}} major <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> stroke should receive long-term oral anticoagulant treatment to prevent atrial thrombus formation. Because age of more than 75 years is a major <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> stroke, but is also a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> major bleeding, the decision to treat elderly patients with anticoagulants should be made on an individual basis...|$|R
25|$|Complications of {{hypertension}} are clinical outcomes {{that result from}} persistent elevation of blood pressure. Hypertension is a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> all clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis since it is a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> atherosclerosis itself. It is an independent predisposing <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke, renal disease, and peripheral arterial disease. It {{is the most important}} <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, in industrialized countries.|$|R
5|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> the {{development}} of acne, other than genetics, have not been conclusively identified. Possible secondary contributors include hormones, infections, diet and stress. Studies investigating the impact of smoking on the incidence and severity of acne have been inconclusive. Sunlight and cleanliness are not associated with acne.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} nonspecific character, these {{symptoms}} are not often recognized {{as signs of}} HIV infection. Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed {{as one of the}} many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms. Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting an unexplained fever who may have <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> the infection.|$|E
5|$|Identified <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, {{standing on}} hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of}} a leg length inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat feet to excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E
30|$|All {{religions}} {{exhibited a}} higher percentage of participants who thought ageing was a major <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> dementia, and {{there was no significant difference}} in the responses of participants who thought that ageing was not a major <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> dementia.|$|R
40|$|Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) {{syndrome}} is an established and modifiable but under recognized <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> common disorders like stroke and hypertension. Objective: To assess awareness level {{of health care}} practitioners and medical students about OSA as a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> stroke and hypertension. Methods: Questionnaire based survey with multiple response type and {{fill in the blanks}} type questions. The data was compiled and analyzed using SPSS version 19. Results: 180 participants completed the survey questionnaire. Only 24 (13. 3 %) identified OSA as a reversible <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> ischemic stroke. 11 (6 %) participants only could answer OSA as an identified <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> hypertension as per Seventh Joint National Committee report. Poor awareness extended over all categories of participants (medical students, trained doctors and nursing staff). Conclusion: This study reveals dismal level of awareness, among health professionals and medical students, about OSA being an established and modifiable <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> hypertension and ischemic stroke...|$|R
30|$|Multivariate {{analysis}} revealed that histologic grade was the only independent <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> overall survival in both groups of patients (p[*]=[*] 0.002, HR[*]=[*] 2.287). The analysis also demonstrated that age was the critical <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> distant metastasis (p[*]=[*] 0.046, HR[*]=[*] 9.687).|$|R
5|$|Many postsecondary {{students}} have reported using Adderall for study purposes {{in different parts}} of the developed world. Among these students, some of the <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> misusing ADHD stimulants recreationally include: possessing deviant personality characteristics (i.e., exhibiting delinquent or deviant behavior), inadequate accommodation of special needs, basing one's self-worth on external validation, low self-efficacy, earning poor grades, and suffering from an untreated mental health disorder.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. <b>Risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.|$|E
5|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> {{endometrial cancer}} include obesity, {{diabetes}} mellitus, breast cancer, use of tamoxifen, never {{having had a}} child, late menopause, high levels of estrogen, and increasing age. Immigration studies (migration studies), which examine the change in cancer risk in populations moving between countries with different rates of cancer, {{show that there is}} some environmental component to endometrial cancer. These environmental risk factors are not well characterized.|$|E

5|$|SAH {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a {{ruptured}} cerebral aneurysm. <b>Risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> spontaneous cases included high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, and cocaine use. Generally, the diagnosis can be determined by a CT scan of the head if done within six hours. Occasionally a lumbar puncture is also required. After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of COPD {{should be considered}} in anyone over the age of 35 to 40 who has shortness of breath, a chronic cough, sputum production, or frequent winter colds and a history of exposure to <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> the disease. Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis. Screening those without symptoms is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} reports of associated <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> vertebral artery dissection; many of these reports suffer from methodological weaknesses, such as selection bias. Elevated homocysteine levels, often due to mutations in the MTHFR gene, appear to {{increase the risk of}} vertebral artery dissection. People with an aneurysm of the aortic root and people with a history of migraine may be predisposed to vertebral artery dissection.|$|E

5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> the development of cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, {{the most common of}} these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants and myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index {{greater than or equal to}} 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with gouty arthritis.|$|E
5|$|In the {{clinical}} sense, a disorder {{is a condition}} requiring treatment as opposed to <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> subsequent disorders. There {{is a lack of}} consensus about the precise meaning of the term 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. Reactive attachment disorder indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure. This can occur either in institutions, or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of RAD under DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 are largely based on this {{understanding of the nature of}} attachment.|$|E

5000|$|Another way to {{calculate}} the risk dominant equilibrium is {{to calculate}} the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> all equilibria and to find the equilibrium with the smallest <b>risk</b> <b>factor.</b> To calculate the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> in our 2x2 game, consider the expected payoff to a player if they play H: [...] (where p is {{the probability that the}} other player will play H), and compare it to the expected payoff if they play G: [...] The value of p which makes these two expected values equal is the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> the equilibrium (H, H), with [...] the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> playing (G, G). You can also calculate the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> playing (G, G) by doing the same calculation, but setting p as the probability the other player will play G. An interpretation for p is it is the smallest probability that the opponent must play that strategy such that the person's own payoff from copying the opponent's strategy is greater than if the other strategy was played.|$|R

5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E
5|$|Pancreatic cancer rarely occurs {{before the}} age of 40, {{and more than half of}} cases of {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinoma occur in those over 70. <b>Risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> pancreatic cancer include tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain rare genetic conditions. About 25% of cases are linked to smoking, and 5–10% are linked to inherited genes. Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed by a combination of medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound or computed tomography, blood tests, and examination of tissue samples (biopsy). The disease is divided into stages, from early (stageI) to late (stageIV). Screening the general population has not been found to be effective.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cholangiocarcinoma include abnormal liver function tests, abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss. Other symptoms such as generalized itching, fever, and changes in color of stool or urine may also occur. The disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests, imaging, endoscopy, and sometimes surgical exploration, with confirmation obtained after a pathologist examines cells from the tumor under a microscope. Known <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), infection with the parasitic liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini or Clonorchis sinensis, some congenital liver malformations, and exposure to Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), a chemical formerly used in medical imaging. However, most people with cholangiocarcinoma have no identifiable risk factors.|$|E
