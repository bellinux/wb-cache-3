Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium spp. have both attracted <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> use. Multiple such products are available for use in Asian countries.

25|$|Werfel {{planned a}} novel about a fictional Catholic saint's life in late seventeenth-century Venice titled Legends, with various subtitles: The Intercessoress of Animals, of Snakes, and of the Dead. Much of the <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> book would {{eventually}} inform The Song of Bernadette (1942), a novel he dedicated to Manon but also features elements of her character and appearance in both the character Bernadette and the apparition of the Blessed Virgin, which she calls the Lady in White {{as well as being}} a pagan term related to the Weisse Frauen of German folklore. Werfel also wrote a necrology about Manon's life for the Catholic journal Commonweal to explain the significance of his dedication, something he never did for other books. Other Werfel novels also feature characters modeled on Manon, notably the prophet Jeremiah's Egyptian bride-to-be in Hearken unto the Voice (1937) and the Bride in Werfel's last novel, Star of the Unborn (1946). Manon Gropius is also a minor character in the 2001 novel The Artist's Wife by Max Phillips, which is based on the life of Alma Mahler.|$|E

2500|$|It was alleged by Tiernan that Hanna {{was used}} as an agent by British Military Intelligence, and that his Army {{handlers}} often took Hanna on fishing trips to the Corbet Lough outside Banbridge. Middle-ranking officers of the Intelligence Corps based at Army headquarters in Lisburn were frequent visitors to his Houston Park home in Lurgan's Mourneview estate. They provided him with weapons and petrol for his car. He also invited regular soldiers to his house for [...] "cups of tea". Tiernan also stated that he discovered through personal contacts with former UVF associates of Hanna the names of four British Army officers and one RUC Special Branch officer who helped him plan the 1974 car bombings and who were also involved in earlier attacks in Dublin which had taken place in 1972 and 1973. These UVF men, from the Portadown and Lurgan areas as well as Belfast, had taken part in the Dublin and Monaghan attacks; they all confirmed that Hanna was the mastermind behind the bombings and that army officers were involved in the operation. On pages 89 and 90 of his book, The Dublin Bombings and the Murder Triangle, Tiernan wrote:"One former UVF man now in his seventies, {{who was a member of}} Billy's squad and whom Gardai named as having been involved in the Dublin bombings, told me during <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> book that Billy worked as a UVF agent for army intelligence officers in Lisburn. He said two middle-ranking officers in plain clothes travelled down from Lisburn once a fortnight in a van to meet Billy and give him instructions on what they wanted done. They would visit his house from time to time and they took him fishing to Banbridge. I saw them in his house a couple of times through the window as I approached but as no member of the unit was allowed to meet them I turned and went home and saw Billy later. But mostly they met him away from his house in carparks or the like. They would meet him in Portadown, Lurgan, Banbridge or out the country somewhere. Occasionally when our unit met to plan operations someone might ask Billy a question about some aspect of the operation. If Billy did not know the answer his reply would be: 'I'll have to take advice on that'. No one pushed the matter further but everyone knew Billy was talking about the army".|$|E
