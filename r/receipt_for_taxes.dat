50|$|Private overprints {{have been}} used for a number of reasons. Generally they cannot be used as control marks, as the stamp or stamps are thus {{rendered}} invalid for prepayment of postage (though some such invalid stamps have successfully passed through the mails, presumably due to an oversight of postal employees). However, while in Great Britain privately overprinted stamps usually served as <b>receipts</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> payments, in 1859, upon application of the Oxford Union Society, there was a unique instance of a private overprint being approved for application on the face of stamps. This is to be distinguished from the more or less frequent application of private overprints to the back of stamps as control marks.|$|R

30|$|We {{undertook}} a detailed {{validation of the}} methodology, finding that the methodology was reasonably effective, subject to the usual consequences of assumptions using microsimulation such as 100 % benefit take-up and under-estimating the impact of non-modelable allowances, full year of <b>receipt</b> <b>for</b> benefits and <b>tax</b> avoidance/evasion in tax system. Overall {{we found that the}} simulated and data based approaches generated a similar trend, albeit with lower levels of inequality for these reasons.

50|$|The {{doctrine}} of constructive receipt {{is often used}} {{in combination with the}} {{doctrine of}} cash equivalence {{in order to determine the}} timing of receipt of income items. A constructive receipt issue arises when the taxpayer has not actually received the income, and the issue is whether the income is substantially available to the taxpayer such that <b>receipt</b> will occur <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> timing purposes. A cash equivalence issue occurs when a taxpayer receives a payment as some sort of promise to pay, and the issue is whether the promise is sufficiently definite as to be considered equivalent to receipt of cash income.|$|R
