It is getting harder to find bark due to the over-stripping of trees {{and the loss of}} forests to agriculture and development. There have been attempts to cultivate the tree species currently used for paper-making, but without success. Currently, there are attempts to <b>reforest</b> the area with a similar species which grows to maturity faster. The use of caustic soda and industrial dyes in the process of making amate has caused problems with pollution, especially of the San Marcos River, whose waters then pollute the Cazones River.|$|E

40|$|Comparing the {{difference}} in forest community structure between a <b>reforested</b> area and a nearby old growth forest {{is one way to}} evaluate the ability of a disturbed forest to recover. Here, we show how a high altitude <b>reforested</b> area in Mt. Apo, Philippines is recovering relative to a nearby old growth forest. The species richness of understory vegetation in the old growth forest did not differ significantly from the 11 year-old <b>reforested</b> area, suggesting fast recovery in this aspect. However, the tree assemblage and sizes (i. e., Diameter at Breast Height) in the old growth forest had significantly higher tree diversity as well as larger trees than the <b>reforested</b> area, suggesting slower recovery in this aspect. In addition, the dominant species in terms of understory vegetation cover, tree abundance, and sizes differed significantly between the old growth forest and the 11 year-old <b>reforested</b> area. In general, the composition and structure of vegetation communities (understory and trees) in the old growth forest and the 11 year-old <b>reforested</b> area were about 13 - 29 % similar. This means that, without management interventions (e. g., assisted recovery), it would probably take much longer time (than 11 years) for the <b>reforested</b> area to get to same condition as the nearby old growth forest. More importantly, results showed which aspects of the <b>reforested</b> area could be adjusted to potentially hasten its recovery towards the old growth forest status...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Recovery of Rhizophora mucronata {{mangrove}} ecosystems {{was investigated}} by assessing the physical characteristics of their sediments {{and the forest}} densities, community composition and diversity of macro-endofauna. This was done in 5 - and 10 -year <b>reforested</b> mangroves and natural and degraded controls. Natural and 10 -year <b>reforested</b> sites were characterised by significantly higher TOM and silt/clay. The natural site had significantly higher (ANOVA, p< 0. 05) macrofaunal densities {{than all the other}} sites. Oligochaetes dominated the natural and 10 -year <b>reforested</b> sites, but in higher densities at the former. Polychaetes and nemertines dominated the 5 -year <b>reforested</b> and degraded sites. PCA, MDS and ANOSIM indicated clear differences in physical characteristics of the sediment and macrofaunal composition between the sites. The study showed that, while mangrove degradation leads to drastic changes in sediment characteristics as well as macrofaunal density and community structure, <b>reforested</b> mangroves evolve slowly back to their natural condition. However, the recovery may take more than 10 years before complete in terms of their TOM and macrofaunal densities...|$|R

In Idaho, women's clubs helped prevent logging in national forests. GFWC had been active since 1890 in areas related to forestry and had a forestry committee. This committee also disseminated information about conservation to the 800,000 members of the group. The GFWC later sponsored [...] "a natural scenic area survey" [...] of the United States in 1915 in order to discover areas that needed conservation.

Although there is recovery of the ecosystem in terms of vegetation, the recovery of closely-linked faunal species in terms of community structure is still understudied. This research investigates the community structure of mangrove crabs under two different management schemes: protected mangroves and <b>reforested</b> mangroves. The transect-plot method was employed in each management scheme to quantify the vegetation, crab assemblages and environmental variables. Community composition of crabs and mangrove trees were compared between protected and <b>reforested</b> mangroves using non-metric multi-dimensional scaling and analysis of similarity in PRIMER 6. Chi-squared was used to test the variance of sex ration of the crabs. Canonical Correspondence Analysis was used to determine the relationship between crabs and environmental parameters. A total of twelve species of crabs belonging to six families were identified in protected mangroves while only four species were documented in <b>reforested</b> mangroves.

40|$|The {{breeding}} {{ecology of}} the Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) and Great Tit (Parus major) was studied for 18 years in three different neighbouring habitats in Sicily, comprising oakwoods, <b>reforested</b> pine and a <b>reforested</b> mix of pine and broad-leaved trees. Both Blue and Great Tits laid eggs up to two weeks earlier in oakwoods than in the <b>reforested</b> areas. Our results indicate a statistically greater breeding success for both species in the oakwoods compared to <b>reforested</b> habitats, with the mixed <b>reforested</b> habitat having a greater success than that of <b>reforested</b> pine habitat. We also correlated reproductive characteristics with local air temperature to verify if the laying date of tits advanced {{over a long period}} of years. Even though a variable egg-laying trend was recorded in the three habitats, an overall negative trendline was obtained indicating that the onset of nesting advanced through the 18 -year study period. On the other hand, the air temperature trend was positive over the same period of time. The model of covariance analysis showed the relationship between egg-laying and March air temperatures remained consistent for both tit species, it was statistically different for each of the three habitats. Nestlings in the oak habitat fledged one day earlier than in <b>reforested</b> habitats and nestlings in the mixed habitat grew faster than nestlings in the pine habitat. Finally, clutch-size and number of fledglings remained consistent over the 18 -year period in all three habitats, suggesting that prey availability may not have changed. Caterpillars comprised the primary prey in the oak and mixed habitats, less in the pine, where tits fed chicks with a more diverse food. The findings of this study indicate the importance of broad-leaved forests, whether natural or regenerated, for insectivorous species, and hence the potential conservation role of forestry management planning...|$|R

The analysis of the impacts of the reforestation on some rainfall indices shows an increase of the 90 th, 95 th, and 99 th percentiles over the <b>reforested</b> zone and off the FJH.
