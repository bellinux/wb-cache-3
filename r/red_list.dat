25|$|The faunal {{diversity}} of Tamil Nadu includes 165 species {{of fresh water}} fish of which 126 (76%) are <b>red</b> <b>listed,</b> 76 species of Amphibians of which 56 (74%) are <b>red</b> <b>listed,</b> 177 species of Reptiles of which 77 (44%) are <b>red</b> <b>listed,</b> 454 species of Birds of which 32 are <b>red</b> <b>listed</b> and 187 species of Mammals of which 40 (21%) are <b>red</b> <b>listed.</b> The endemic fauna includes 36 species of Amphibians, 63 species of reptiles, 17 species of birds and 24 species of mammals.|$|R
50|$|Many {{indicator}} species are red-listed, {{but not necessarily}} all. National <b>red</b> <b>lists</b> of fungi typically include many polypores and are used as indicator lists of conservation value in many European countries.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany {{locally and}} {{regionally}} rare species {{are not covered}} by <b>red</b> <b>lists,</b> thus compromising conservation strategies. This is the case with ecotones. After applying three rarity criteria based on both geographic range and on local occurrences to 1755 species of a large transitional zone in South America, we discuss how the priority hierarchy found in the study region can be combined with red books in decision-making to reduce the gaps left by the classification systems adopted by these lists. We point out clear directions about how these species can be used to guide decision making in ecotones, including identifying species of interest for conservation that have not yet been included in <b>red</b> <b>lists,</b> structuring a species group of narrow distribution occurring in areas adjacent to ecological transitions into a hierarchy of priorities for conservation, and using species of the highest hierarchy position in decision making. We believe that the combination of regional lists with national and international <b>red</b> <b>lists</b> is an interesting strategy in the management of species for conservation...|$|R

5|$|Between 2008 and 2016, IUCN <b>Red</b> <b>List</b> {{assessors}} for lions {{used only}} two subspecific names, P. l. leo for African lion populations and P. l. persica for the Asiatic lion population.|$|E
5|$|Fairly {{common in}} its large range, {{and with its}} {{population}} stable, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be a Least Concern on its <b>red</b> <b>list</b> of threatened species.|$|E
50|$|Some Suillus {{species have}} entered {{regional}} <b>red</b> <b>lists</b> as endangered or vulnerable. Seven European countries have listed S. sibiricus. Individual countries have also listed other species, including S. flavidus, S. tridentinus, S. collinitus, S. plorans and S. lakei.|$|R
50|$|Corypha taliera is {{a species}} of palm, {{originally}} native Myanmar (Burma) and to the Bengal region of India and Bangladesh, but now very close to extinction. First discovered by British botanist William Roxburg. this species is <b>red</b> <b>listed</b> in IUCN.|$|R
2500|$|Hygrocybe quieta {{is typical}} of waxcap grasslands, a declining habitat due to {{changing}} agricultural practices. The oily waxcap appears on the official or provisional national <b>red</b> <b>lists</b> of threatened fungi in several European countries, including Denmark, Germany (Bavaria), Poland, [...] and Switzerland.|$|R
5|$|Freshwater and {{terrestrial}} molluscs appear exceptionally {{vulnerable to}} extinction. Estimates {{of the numbers}} of nonmarine molluscs vary widely, partly because many regions have not been thoroughly surveyed. There is also a shortage of specialists who can identify all the animals in any one area to species. However, in 2004 the IUCN <b>Red</b> <b>List</b> of Threatened Species included nearly 2,000 endangered nonmarine molluscs. For comparison, {{the great majority of}} mollusc species are marine, but only 41 of these appeared on the 2004 <b>Red</b> <b>List.</b> About 42% of recorded extinctions since the year 1500 are of molluscs, consisting almost entirely of nonmarine species.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the International Union for Conservation of Nature's IUCN <b>Red</b> <b>List</b> of Endangered Species named 64 species, {{one-third of}} all oceanic shark species, as being at risk of {{extinction}} due to fishing and shark finning.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Greenpeace International {{added the}} tiger shark to its seafood <b>red</b> <b>list,</b> {{which is a}} list of fish {{commonly}} sold around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.|$|E
40|$|Extinction {{risk and}} {{conservation}} status of species are assessed {{at the global}} scale by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). To ensure objectivity, repeatability and traceability, assessments follow a standardized process that uses reliable and verifiable information. Assessments are synthesized according to guidelines, which have recently been adjusted for application at sub–global scales. Nevertheless, species may have several, different or overlapping conservation status. To quantitatively compare assessments from global to sub–national scales, {{in this study we}} analyzed 15 assessment lists for 66 game bird species in France. Assessments were declared to be made following IUCN guidelines. Overall, our results reveal that (1) assessments at large spatial scales tend to give lower threat status than small–scale assessments; (2) large–scale assessments made it possible to formally verify information whereas smaller–scale assessments usually did not; (3) large–scale assessments {{are more likely to be}} based on standardized evidence of reduction in population size and are less exposed to ‘scale–effects’ and ‘edge–effects’; (4) large–scale assessments are also more often based on scientific literature sensu stricto; and (5) sources are more accurately synthesized than <b>red</b> <b>lists</b> at small spatial scales. Our results suggest that small–scale <b>red</b> <b>lists</b> do not fully match IUCN guidelines and differ significantly in their assessment processes when compared to global standards. The use of subjective and unreliable data in small–scale <b>red</b> <b>lists</b> (above all in national and sub–national lists) may jeopardise the original aim of IUCN Red Lists to provide comprehensive and scientifically rigorous information, and could thus compromise the credibility and prestige of IUCN <b>red</b> <b>lists</b> in the eyes of researchers, the general public, and other stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|Fifty eight {{species and}} three {{varieties}} of slime moulds {{were collected in}} the Lipówka reserve in 1999 and 2001. Thirty taxa of slime moulds very rare and rare in Poland were recorded in the reserve, including: Arcyria minuta, A. stipata, Physarum penetrale, P. robustum, and Symphytocarpus flaccidus which are <b>red</b> <b>listed</b> (Drozdowicz et al. 2006) ...|$|R
50|$|The Connecticut Historic Resource Inventory lists 230 {{structures}} in Redding, the oldest built in 1710 by early settler Moses Knapp. The Town of <b>Redding</b> <b>lists</b> another 285 structures that {{are believed to}} have been built before 1901 that are not listed in the Connecticut Historic Resource Inventory, the oldest built in 1711 by John Read.|$|R
5|$|Old {{scientific}} {{data do not}} distinguish between the two species, making it useless for determining structural differences between them. The IUCN lists both species as data deficient on their <b>Red</b> <b>List</b> of endangered species because of this issue.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN <b>Red</b> <b>List</b> {{does not}} {{distinguish}} the hooded crow from the carrion crow, {{but the two}} species together have an extensive range, estimated at 10millionkm2 (3.8million mi2), and a large population, including an estimated 14 to 34 million individuals in Europe alone. They are not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN <b>Red</b> <b>List</b> (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), so are evaluated as Least Concern. The carrion crow/hooded crow hybrid zone is slowly spreading northwest, but the hooded crow has {{on the order of}} three million territories in just Europe (excluding Russia).|$|E
5|$|The IUCN <b>Red</b> <b>List</b> of Threatened Species {{lists the}} Stresemann's bushcrow as {{endangered}} {{because of its}} very restricted range and loss of suitable habitat.

50|$|The {{nature reserve}} protects {{an area of}} {{surviving}} old-growth forest dominated by spruce in a landscape otherwise heavily forested. Trees up to 300 years old grow in the reserve. The unspoilt forest with its coarse woody debris provides a habitat for several <b>red</b> <b>listed</b> or unusual species such as Schismatomma pericleum, Chaenothecopsis viridialba, Haploporus odorus and Anomoporia bombycina.|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{the threat}} status of {{ecosystems}} {{is a useful}} tool for understanding biodiversity loss on Earth. In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) established a working group at the fourth World Conservation Congress to develop quantitative categories and criteria for assessing ecosystem threat status. These categories and criteria were similar to those used to assess extinction risk for species. This working group strove to establish <b>red</b> <b>lists</b> of ecosystems by applying these criteria to ecosystems at local, regional, and global scales. Ecosystem <b>red</b> <b>lists</b> were designed to be complementary to species <b>red</b> <b>lists</b> for use in creating biodiversity conservation policies. The criteria used for assessment were grouped into four classes: short-term decline in distribution or ecological function, historical declines in distribution or ecological function, small current distribution with decline in distribution or ecological function, or very restrictedcurrent distribution. In this paper, we illustrate the use of these criteria for assessing ecosystem threat status; we used literature data on the areas of occupancy for four ecosystems in China’s Liaohe Delta in 1988 and 2006 to evaluate the threat status of these four ecosystems. We also discuss challenges that lie ahead for this method of assessment. Measures of ecosystem distribution and area of occupancy should be based on proper spatial scales. Appropriate quantitative methods are also needed to measure changes in ecosystem function. The final proposed assessment protocol will be presented for further discussion at the 2012 World Conservation Congress...|$|R
