500|$|All of {{a sudden}} it was kicking off, big time. Everyone started piling in, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me...</b> The only people not {{involved}} were [...] John Lukic, Tony Adams, David O'Leary and me... I went over to break things up... and spotted the cavalry coming over the half-way line, in the shape of O'Leary and Adams. I felt it was my job to head them off at the pass and moved in, instinctively grabbing Adams with one hand and thumping him with the other." ...|$|E

They would kill us if we reacted...if we cried, or showed that we cared about the victims. They would kill you right away. So I had to shut it all off...I can shut off {{everything}} in my body, practically, physically. I saw them killing people <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> the blood was there, but I didn't smell it. I made myself numb...The killing was unbearable. You go crazy if you smell the blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{scene where}} a group of horses ran down a hill with burning {{branches}} tied to their tails needed to be filmed from in front, so the crew built a hut made of wood, stones, and rocks in which stood Peruzzi the cameraman, who tells that [...] "At the order of Action! I saw this mass of heads and hooves coming at me at full speed, and did not breath until I saw them open up to the sides of the hut, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> We had to improvise and replace the lack of technology with smarts, ingenuity and valor." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dallas Patrolman Marion L. Baker {{had been}} {{assigned}} to serve as a motorcycle escort for the motorcade, and he was riding just behind the camera cars. He testified that the first shot he could hear was fired after he turned from Main St. onto Houston St. and had traveled approximately 60 to 80 feet along Houston as he approached the Houston and Elm streets intersection. Baker stated that he recognized the first shot he could hear as the report of a high-powered rifle and that he thought the shots had originated from the building [...] "either <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> [...] or the one across to the right of it" [...] He also said that he noticed pigeons take flight up from the roof of the depository building and start flying around. Baker then quickly drove to the corner of Houston and Elm St., parked his motorcycle, then looked westward into the aftermath of persons screaming, running and laying on the ground. He then listened to Chief Curry's radio broadcast saying, [...] "Get some men up on that railroad track".|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving as}} Assembly Speaker, Brown was {{diagnosed}} with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease that still has no cure and that would slowly steal his eyesight. RP is a hereditary disease that causes a continual loss of peripheral vision and often leads to total blindness. Brown's two sisters were also diagnosed with RP. Brown remarked, [...] "Having RP is a challenge, as Speaker of the Assembly {{it was very important}} that I recognize people in the halls of the Legislature. But I couldn't see people unless they were <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I needed to have the security people give me notes to tell me who was in the room. Reading is also very difficult so I use larger print notes and memos. Living with RP means having to use more of your brain function—I listen more intently, I memorize vast amounts of information, and I have trained my computer to recognize numerous verbal commands." [...] Brown has worked with the Foundation Fighting Blindness to raise awareness of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|Several urban legends exist {{regarding}} the chariot sequence. One states that a stuntman died during filming. Stuntman Nosher Powell {{says in his}} autobiography, [...] "We had a stunt man killed in the third week, and it happened <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> You saw it, too, because the cameras kept turning and it's in the movie." [...] But film historian Monica Silveira Cyrino discounted this statement in 2005, and {{said there were no}} published accounts of any serious injuries or deaths during filming of the chariot race. Indeed, the only recorded death to occur during the filming was that of producer Sam Zimbalist, who {{died of a heart attack}} at the age of 57 on November 4, 1958, while on the set. MGM executives asked Wyler to take over the executive producer's job, with an extra salary of $100,000. [...] Wyler agreed, although he had assistance from experienced MGM executives as well. Production supervisor Henry Henigson was so overcome by stress-related heart problems during the shoot that doctors feared for his life and ordered him off the set. Henigson, however, returned to the production shortly thereafter and did not die. [...] Nor were any horses injured during the shoot; in fact, the number of hours the horses could be used each day was actually shortened to keep them out of the summer heat.|$|E

2500|$|... "Suddenly, I {{heard the}} clatter of Leycester's machine gun above {{the roar of the}} engine. I looked round to see what he was {{shooting}} at, and nearly had a heart attack. Slanting down from above, getting nicely into position thirty yards behind my tail, was an Albatros. [...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think than I had ever turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as he looked back at me. I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then slid out of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I caught sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke. For an instant I saw the German pilot, looking down {{over the side of the}} cockpit. Then the smoke and flames enveloped him." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{moon was}} {{climbing}} higher and higher, its light {{began to fall}} {{here and there in}} masses through the more open districts of the wood, and <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> a glow of a different colour appeared among the trees.

60|$|His solicitude {{about my}} dress {{filled me with}} surprise, but this was soon {{forgotten}} in the shock which was awaiting me.

6000|$|... "It {{seemed an}} age before I finally heard the click {{that opened the}} door in front of me.

The old man was standing <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> his mouth wide open with astonishment at the wonderfully natural performance of his wooden bird, as he thought me.
