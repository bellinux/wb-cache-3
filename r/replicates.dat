5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation {{is a change}} in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell <b>replicates.</b> In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce.|$|E
5|$|The Ichneumonidae are {{specialized}} parasitoids, {{often of}} Lepidoptera larvae deeply buried in plant tissues, {{which may be}} woody. For this purpose, they have exceptionally long ovipositors; they detect their hosts by smell and vibration. Some of the largest species, including Rhyssa persuasoria and Megarhyssa macrurus, parasitise horntails, large sawflies whose adult females also have impressively long ovipositors. Some parasitic species have a mutualistic relationship with a polydnavirus that weakens the host's immune system and <b>replicates</b> in the oviduct of the female wasp.|$|E

40|$|An {{intention}} of MapReduce Sets for <b>Replicated</b> Join expressions analysis has to suggest criteria how <b>Replicated</b> Join expressions in <b>Replicated</b> Join {{data can be}} defined {{in a meaningful way}} and how they should be compared. Similitude based MapReduce Sets for <b>Replicated</b> Join Expression Analysis and MapReduce Sets for Assignment is expected to adhere to fundamental principles of the scientific <b>Replicated</b> Join process that are expressiveness of <b>Replicated</b> Join models and reproducibility of their <b>Replicated</b> Join inference. <b>Replicated</b> Join expressions are assumed to be elements of a <b>Replicated</b> Join expression space or Conjecture class and <b>Replicated</b> Join data provide “information ” which of these <b>Replicated</b> Join expressions should be used to interpret the <b>Replicated</b> Join data. An inference <b>Replicated</b> Join algorithm constructs the mapping between <b>Replicated</b> Join data and <b>Replicated</b> Join expressions, in particular by a <b>Replicated</b> Join cost minimization process. Fluctuations in the <b>Replicated</b> Join data often limit the <b>Replicated</b> Join precision, which we can achieve to uniquely identify a single <b>Replicated</b> Join expression as interpretation of the <b>Replicated</b> Join data. We advocate an information theoretic perspective on <b>Replicated</b> Join expression analysis to resolve this dilemma where the tradeoff between <b>Replicated</b> Join informativeness of statistical inference <b>Replicated</b> Join and their <b>Replicated</b> Join stability is mirrored in the information-theoretic <b>Replicated</b> Join optimum of high <b>Replicated</b> Join information rate and zero communication expression error.

50|$|As {{a general}} rule, DNA viruses <b>replicate</b> within the nucleus while RNA viruses <b>replicate</b> within the {{cytoplasm}}.

5|$|There is a {{cutaway model}} of Viribus Unitis in the Museum of Military History in Vienna. The model is at {{a scale of}} 1:25 and has a total length of 6 metres. It was built between 1913 and 1917 by eight {{craftsmen}} of the shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino. The model is true to the original in structure, layout, and engine system. It is accurate to the point that, for instance, the painting in the wardroom of the model exactly <b>replicates</b> the original not only in subject {{but also in the}} painting technique (oil on canvas).|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis is {{a disease}} of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore, receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue tropism is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the type I interferon receptor, poliovirus not only <b>replicates</b> in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to be infected orally with the virus.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Albert Sabin {{developed}} another live, oral polio vaccine. It {{was produced}} by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine <b>replicates</b> very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of wild poliovirus infection and replication, but the vaccine strain is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. A single dose of Sabin's oral polio vaccine produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in about 50 percent of recipients. Three doses of live-attenuated oral vaccine produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95 percent of recipients. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957, and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio vaccine used worldwide.|$|E
50|$|In the quasispecies model, {{mutations}} occur through errors made in {{the process}} of copying already existing sequences. Further, selection arises because different types of sequences tend to <b>replicate</b> at different rates, which leads to the suppression of sequences that <b>replicate</b> more slowly in favor of sequences that <b>replicate</b> faster. However, the quasispecies model does not predict the ultimate extinction of all but the fastest <b>replicating</b> sequence. Although the sequences that <b>replicate</b> more slowly cannot sustain their abundance level by themselves, they are constantly replenished as sequences that <b>replicate</b> faster mutate into them. At equilibrium, removal of slowly <b>replicating</b> sequences due to decay or outflow is balanced by replenishing, so that even relatively slowly <b>replicating</b> sequences can remain present in finite abundance.|$|R

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of the common cold {{are believed to be}} primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then <b>replicates</b> in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the {{symptoms of}} croup due to the small size of their airways.|$|E
5|$|There are 57 {{nucleotide}} substitutions which {{distinguish the}} attenuated Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent (the Mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the Sabin 2 strain, and 10 substitutions {{are involved in}} attenuating the Sabin 3 strain. The primary attenuating factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which alters stem-loop structures, and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine <b>replicates</b> very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue.|$|E

The fourth mission was completed in 2008 with various teams having already demonstrated all of the required aerial robotic behaviors mandated by the fourth mission rules, except being able to demonstrate these behaviors seamlessly in under 15 minutes—a feat considered by the organizer and judges to be inevitable given a bit more time, and therefore no longer a significant challenge. Thus the fourth mission was terminated, $80,000 in awards distributed, and the fifth mission established.|$|E
40|$|To study {{chromatin}} structure at {{the sites}} of DNA <b>replicated</b> in permeable cells, deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) sensitivity of newly <b>replicated</b> DNA in permeable mouse sarcoma cells was {{compared with that of}} newly <b>replicated</b> DNA in intact cells. About 35 % of the DNA <b>replicated</b> in permeable cells was hypersensitive to DNase I, and the remaining DNA showed the same DNase I sensitivity as that of parental chromatin DNA. The sensitivity of DNA <b>replicated</b> in permeable cells was higher than that of DNA newly <b>replicated</b> in intact cells, and was close to that of DNA <b>replicated</b> in the presence of cycloheximide. The sensitivity of DNA pulse-labeled with [3 H]deoxythymidine triphosphate by replication in permeable cells was reduced significantly by chasing with cold deoxythymidine triphosphate. The present results suggest that chromatin structure at {{the sites of}} DNA <b>replicated</b> in permeable cells is similar to that at the sites of DNA <b>replicated</b> in living cells in the absence of protein synthesis, and that some structural change (possibly toward the maturation) of newly <b>replicated</b> chromatin occurs after the DNA replication in permeable cells. </p...|$|R

5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases <b>replicates</b> the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E
