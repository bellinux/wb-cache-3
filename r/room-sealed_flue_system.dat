5000|$|This {{generator}} {{is sometimes}} confused with <b>flue</b> gas <b>systems,</b> which draw inert {{gas from the}} boiler systems of the ship. <b>Flue</b> gas <b>systems</b> {{do not have a}} burner but only [...] "clean" [...] and measure the air before delivering it to the cargo hold.|$|R
50|$|A back boiler {{can improve}} the {{efficiency}} of a stove by acting as a heat-sink and can also act {{as a method of}} extracting additional heat from the <b>flue</b> <b>system</b> which would otherwise have been lost.Manufacturers of stoves with back boilers quote efficiency figures of up to 80% on oil-fed models.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flue</b> <b>system</b> is {{composed}} of two flues, the inner flue and the outer flue. The outer flue draws air {{into the bottom of}} the sealed firebox to allow for combustion. The inner flue draws hot exhaust gasses from the top of the sealed firebox and vents them directly to the outside of the structure through either an adjacent wall or the roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} type of heated {{platform}} appeared in modern-day Northeast of China {{and used a}} single <b>flue</b> <b>systems</b> found in the hypocaust of Ancient Rome and the ondol of Korean origin.

Its single flue is 'L' shaped, built from adobe and cobblestones and covered with stone slabs.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, {{dedicated}} low emission {{gas heaters}} {{do not require}} a <b>flue</b> <b>system.</b> Furthermore, {{with the introduction of}} oxygen depletion sensors and thermostatic controls, they do not place critical reliance on ventilation as had been the case. These heaters can be positioned more conveniently and centralised to affect optimum warm air distribution. By definition unflued low NOx gas heaters are 100% efficient as all heat energy released from the flame is converted to useful heat.|$|R
50|$|The adobe blocks {{are laid}} {{so that the}} joints are staggered. There is no mortar in the {{vertical}} joints to allow for expansion and contraction during firing. Rammed Earth and Mud Pile can also be fired, but must be fired from both sides because of {{the thickness of the}} walls. Building with stiff wet mud, like a potter, allows for thinner walls, and the possibility of incorporating <b>flue</b> <b>systems</b> into the walls. Arches can be formed by stacking non mortared blocks as form work, and removing them after firing.|$|R
50|$|Notwithstanding gas explosions, the {{greatest}} danger to the public from gas is Carbon Monoxide (CO), which is a toxic byproduct of the combustion process, in increased volume if combustion is incomplete. Most of the concern for gas safety focuses on safe CO dispersal through ventilation and <b>flue</b> <b>systems,</b> and prevention of incomplete combustion by regular service and maintenance of heat producing appliances, especially open-flued appliances. Modern gas appliances, especially those with fan assisted flues, are safer in this respect {{and the number of}} fatalities from CO poisoning has greatly declined.|$|R

Most of the concern for gas safety focuses on avoiding excessive production of CO through adequate ventilation and correct combustion, and the safe dispersal of the small amounts produced by correct combustion through effective <b>flue</b> <b>systems.</b> Modern <b>room-sealed</b> gas appliances are much safer in this respect and the number of fatalities from CO poisoning has greatly declined. Each year in the UK around 30 people are killed as a result of CO poisoning.|$|R
50|$|The stack was {{designed}} to discharge exhaust gases from the various roasting and smelting furnaces at the smelter. The stack is situated just below {{the top of a}} hill. The smelter had a large network of exhaust flues from the furnaces that all fed a main flue. The main flue carried the combined smelter exhaust gases a half-mile up the hill to the stack. The <b>flue</b> <b>system</b> and stack combined to provide a natural draft to carry the smelter exhaust gases, and it was claimed to be capable of handling three to four million cubic feet per minute of gas.|$|R
50|$|To {{economically}} manufacture a condensing boiler's {{heat exchanger}} (and for the appliance to be manageable at installation), the smallest practical size for its output is preferred. This approach {{has resulted in}} heat exchangers with high combustion side resistance, often requiring {{the use of a}} combustion fan to move the products through narrow passageways. This has also had the benefit of providing the energy for the <b>flue</b> <b>system</b> as the expelled combustion gases are usually below 100°C (212°F) and as such, have a density close to air, with little buoyancy. The combustion fan helps to pump exhaust gas to the outside.|$|R

40|$|The {{utilization}} of wood biomass to generate district heat {{and power in}} communities that have access to this energy source is increasing. In this paper the effect of wood fuel properties, combustion condition, and <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>system</b> on variation in the amount and formation of particles in the flue gas of typical district heating wood boilers are discussed based on the literature survey. Direct measurements of particulate matter (PM) emissions from wood boilers with district heating applications are reviewed and presented. Finally, recommendations are given regarding the selection of wood fuel, combustion <b>system</b> condition, and <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>system</b> in district heating systems {{in order to meet}} stringent air quality standards. It is concluded that {{utilization of}} high quality wood fuel, such as wood pellets produced from natural, uncontaminated stem wood, would generate the least PM emissions compared to other wood fuel types. Particulate matter emissions from grate burners equipped with electrostatic precipitators when using wood pellets can be well below stringent regulatory emission limit such as particulate emission limit of Metro Vancouver, Canada.

50|$|Not all {{available}} devices {{in the market}} have a flue gas treatment plant. But there are devices available with a dry <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>system</b> according to the rigorous European standards. Such a <b>flue</b> gas <b>system</b> mainly consists of a dry sorption system for SO2, HCI, HF, dust reduction, heavy metals, dioxins, etc. To protect the whole system, an automatic emergency water injection facility at the combustion chamber serves for the cooling of flue gas in case, too much waste or waste with too high calorific value is charged. Mobile incinerator units with such a system are environmental friendly. Many units are now offered with a Venturi Scrubber as the preferred treatment module.|$|R

5000|$|Its {{interior}} cavity, {{leading to}} a (often) convoluted <b>flue</b> <b>system,</b> channels the hot exhaust from a firewood/coal fireplace, usually the cooking fire from an adjacent room {{that serves as a}} kitchen, sometimes from a stove set below floor level. This allows a longer contact time between the exhaust (which still contains much heat from the combustion source) and (indirectly) the inside of the room, hence more heat transfer/recycling back into the room, effectively making it a ducted heating system similar to the hypocaust system used by ancient Romans. A separate stove may be used for controlling the amount of smoke circulating through the kang, maintaining comfort in warmer weather. Typically, a kang occupies one-third to one half the area the room, and is used for sleeping at night and for other activities during the day.

50|$|The Frederick Francis Woodland Palace is a {{historic}} house located in Francis Park 2.5 mi northeast of Kewanee, Illinois. Frederick Francis, a multi-talented architect, engineer, and artist, began work on the house in 1889; while {{he and his wife}} moved into the house a year later, he continued to work on it until his death in 1926. The house has an eclectic design noted both for its vernacular interpretation of Queen Anne and Romanesque Revival architecture and its innovative engineering. The building's exterior design includes a hand-chipped brick exterior, a concrete tower above the main entrance, two porches on the south side, a solarium on the west side, and a gambrel roof. The interior's noteworthy features include a bedroom designed like a Pullman sleeping car, a system of levers which opened both front doors at once, a hearth with a <b>flue</b> <b>system</b> that also helped heat the house, a water filtration and heating system supplied by a cistern, and several secret compartments.|$|R

40|$|Chinese {{translation}} of the Reduce Air Infiltration in Furnaces fact sheet. Provides {{suggestions on how to}} improve furnace energy efficiency. Fuel-fired furnaces discharge combustion products through a stack or a chimney. Hot furnace gases are less dense and more buoyant than ambient air, so they rise, creating a differential pressure between the top and the bottom of the furnace. This differential, known as thermal head, is the source of a natural draft or negative pressure in furnaces and boilers. A well-designed furnace (or boiler) is built to avoid air leakage into the furnace or leakage of flue gases from the furnace to the ambient. However, with time, most furnaces develop cracks or openings around doors, joints, and hearth seals. These openings (leaks) usually appear small compared with the overall dimensions of the furnace, so they are often ignored. The negative pressure created by the natural draft (or use of an induced-draft fan) in a furnace draws cold air through the openings (leaks) and into the furnace. The cold air becomes heated to the furnace exhaust gas temperature and then exits through the <b>flue</b> <b>system,</b> wasting valuable fuel. It might also cause excessive oxidation of metals or other materials in the furnaces. The heat loss due to cold air leakage resulting from the natural draft can be estimated if you know four major parameters: (1) The furnace or flue gas temperature; (2) The vertical distance H between the opening (leak) and the point where the exhaust gases leave the furnace and its <b>flue</b> <b>system</b> (if the leak is along a vertical surface, H will be an average value); (3) The area of the leak, in square inches; and (4) The amount of operating time the furnace spends at negative pressure. Secondary parameters that affect the amount of air leakage include these: (1) The furnace firing rate; (2) The flue gas velocity through the stack or the stack cross-section area; (3) The burner operating conditions (e. g., excess air, combustion air temperature, and so on). For furnaces or boilers using an induced-draft (ID) fan, the furnace negative pressure depends on the fan performance and frictional losses between the fan inlet and the point of air leakage. In most cases, it would be necessary to measure or estimate negative pressure at the opening. The amount of air leakage, the heat lost in flue gases, and their effects on increased furnace or boiler fuel consumption can be calculated by using the equations and graphs given in Industrial Furnaces (see W. Trinks et al., below). Note that the actual heat input required to compensate for the heat loss in flue gases due to air leakage would be greater than the heat contained in the air leakage because of the effect of available heat in the furnace. For a high-temperature furnace that is not maintained properly, the fuel consumption increase due to air leakage can be as high as 10 % of the fuel input...|$|R
