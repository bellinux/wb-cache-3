After reviewing such systems, the paper evaluates the much more recent development of over-resonant running. A dynamic model is presented together with the electrical analogue, and the paper indicates that over-resonant induced flow pumps seem particularly suited to electrically driven solar (photovoltaic) - and wind-powered applications...|$|R
40|$|Dual Gradient Drilling is an {{exciting}} technology which promises to solve the current technical hurdles and economic risks of Deepwater Drilling. Several techniques for Dual Gradient Drilling have been proposed to the industry. One such method involves installing a subsea booster pump at the seafloor {{with the aim of}} returning the drilling fluid back to the rig. The pump will manage annular pressures in the wellbore as circulation rates and mud weights vary and will permit early detection of wellbore influxes. Any such pump chosen to achieve this objective will be subjected to very high differential pressures and will be faced with the onerous task of lifting very abrasive and viscous mud slurries from the sea floor back to the drilling rig. This distance in deep water may be well within the range of about 4, 000 ? 12, 000 feet depending on the operating water depth of the rig. Several pump technologies available to the industry were examined. Piston pumps are very efficient and can withstand the high differential pressures encountered in the Mudlift Drilling System. However, their drawbacks are their large size and weight and high initial capital cost and maintenance costs. Centrifugal pumps on the other hand are relatively smaller than piston and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps</b> and are generally less expensive. Disc pumps, with their non-impingement design are able to handle solids and fluids with a high gas volume fraction but, like centrifugal pumps, are generally less efficient than <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pumps.</b> <b>Diaphragm</b> <b>pumps</b> are capable of maintaining a constant rate regardless of pressure fluctuations. They can handle very abrasive solids with limited wear on the pump. They also excel at handling very viscous fluids and they can be modified to handle up to 95 % gas volume fraction. Like piston pumps, they have very high efficiencies. The potential of each of these pump technologies to meet the requirements for the Mudlift Drilling System was examined in this thesis. The benefits and drawbacks of each of these pump technologies were highlighted and modifications {{to meet the demands of}} the mudlift system evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Piston <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} world-wide to {{transport}} abrasive and/or aggressive slurries against high discharge pressures in the mining, mineral processing and power industries. Limitation of excessive deformation of the diaphragm {{is of utmost}} importance for eliminating fatigue failures of the diaphragm and thereby obtaining a high reliability of the piston <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump.</b> The deformation shape of the diaphragm {{is the result of}} a complex 2 -way Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) mechanism within the pump chamber between the propelling fluid, the <b>diaphragm</b> and the <b>pumped</b> slurry. The understanding of this FSI mechanism has improved in the last decades but is still limited. Load and deformation analysis of the diaphragm is currently based quasi-static assumptions. This is however an over-simplification, especially for the larger piston <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps</b> used in the mining and mineral processing industries. In these applications, fluid momentum loading by both convective as well as unsteady fluid acceleration become important to consider.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. In this paper, we take two important steps to analyse hydropneumatic systems and their components. In this regard, we first extend a new all-speed approach to solve the full onedimensional Navier-Stokes equations. The extended approach can be equally used to simulate both gas and liquid flows, considering an equivalent gas constant for the latter case. We further apply the extended approach to analyse both liquid water and air flows through two separate hydro-pneumatic circuits. To verify the accuracy of our solution, we compare our solutions with those of Lax-Wendroff method. The comparison shows that the current proposed all-speed algorithm provides solutions with excellent accuracy. One important advantage of this new extended algorithm is in treating the two-phase fluid flow problems, where there are mixed liquid water and vapour behaviours, e. g., <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps.</b> Therefore, as a second contribution, we simulate a multi-component <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump,</b> whose parts consist of check valves, signal subsystems, conveys, and air distribution system.

40|$|Commercial pumps {{tested at}} MIT's Jensen lab for {{applications}} pumping highly corrosive materials at medium pressure (100 - 300 psi) {{and a low}} flow rate (less than 50 mL/min) have proven unreliable. The most common failures observed have been check valve failure and insufficient chemical compatibility. Some of these pumps use dual reciprocating pistons to drive the fluid, requiring the use of four check valves. This lowers {{the reliability of the}} pump as a whole to an undesirable level. A novel pump system design could operate without the need for any check valves. Operating three <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps</b> in series creates a pseudo-peristaltic pump, but requires check valves on both sides of each <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump.</b> Instead, a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump</b> was designed such that the diaphragm can completely seal at the apex of each stroke, eliminating the need for check valves between the pumps. Proper timing of the draw and pump phases of the cycle of each pump eliminates the need for check valves at the ends of the series as well. Thus, each stroke of the pump is able to drive fluid forward and seal to allow adjacent pumps to draw effectively and prevent them from creating backflow. Additionally, current pumps have problems with chemical compatibility due to poor material selection. Thus, this new pump could be made to be more reliable and more robust against corrosion by choosing materials with high chemical compatibility.
