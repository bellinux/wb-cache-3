50|$|In 1997, the {{official}} standards were revised {{to restrict the}} Select grade to A maturity carcasses, and to raise the minimum marbling score to qualify for Choice to modest for B maturity cattle. These changes were implemented to improve the uniformity and consistency of the grading system.Yield grades are intended to estimate the pounds of boneless closely trimmed retail cuts from the carcass. Closely trimmed refers to approximately ¼ inch <b>of</b> <b>external</b> <b>fat.</b> Yield grade is determined by considering 4 carcass characteristics: <b>external</b> <b>fat,</b> Kidney, pelvic and heart fat (KPH), Ribeye area (REA), and Hot carcass weight (HCW). The amount <b>of</b> <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> is measured at the ribbed surface between the 12th and 13th ribs. The ribbing of carcasses is described in the U.S. standards for beef grading. <b>External</b> <b>fat</b> is measured {{at a distance of}} ¾ the length of the ribeye from the chine bone end. This initial number can be adjusted up or down depending on any abnormal fat deposits. As the amount <b>of</b> <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> increases, the percent of retail cuts decreases.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Twenty beef carcass sides varying in USDA quality and yield grades ere selected from commercial packing plants to study the physical and chemical composition of beef retail cuts. Thirteen cuts (in sets of four) were fabricated and assigned to one of four treatments: (1) 0. 3 cm <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> trim, raw; (2) 0. 0 cm <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> trim, cooked; (3) 0. 3 cm <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> trim, cooked; and (4) 0. 6 cm <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> trim, cooked. Retail cuts assigned to the cooked treatment were either braised, broiled, or roasted. Both the cooked and raw cuts were dissected into separable lean, <b>external</b> <b>fat,</b> seam fat, and waste (heavy connective tissue and bone). Chemical analyses were conducted on the separable lean to determine fat, moisture, protein, and ash content. In addition, cooking yields and fat retention were calculated using raw versus cooked data. Dissection data suggested that percentage separable lean increased as cuts were trimmed <b>of</b> <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> cover. Choice retail cuts had a higher percentage of seam fat than Select retail cuts. Arm roasts proved to yield the lowest percentage of separable lean, as well as the most seam fat and waste, even if all the <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> was removed before cooking. Trimming cuts <b>of</b> <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> before cooking had few significant (P < 0. 05) effects on chemical fat, moisture, protein, or ash content within a cut. The eye of round roasts showed a difference (P < 0. 05) between the 0. 0 cm and 0. 6 cm treatments for fat content. As anticipated, retail cuts from the Choice quality grade had higher chemical fat contents than Select cuts. Few significant differences were found for cooking yields and fat retention as influenced by USDA quality grade or trim level. Retail cuts that were braised had numerically lower cooking yields and percentage moisture than cuts that were roasted or broiled regardless of quality grade or trim level.

The basal [Ca 2 +]i was 79 ± 35 nm (n= 27) in cells voltage clamped at − 70 to − 80 mV, and 75 ± 29 nm (mean ±s. d., n= 82) in unclamped cells at a mean membrane potential of − 67 ± 6 mV. <b>Removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>external</b> Na+ evoked a small reversible [Ca 2 +]i increase of 29 ± 21 nm (n= 27) in cells voltage clamped at − 70 to − 80 mV, and of 35 ± 18 nm (n= 37) in unclamped cells. This [Ca 2 +]i increase, and the time constant of the subsequent [Ca 2 +]i recovery after Na+ re-addition, did not change significantly with the holding potential between − 110 and − 60 mV. The basal [Na+]i was 5. 6 ± 1. 3 mm (n= 18). Increasing [Na+]i by inhibiting the Na+-K+ pump with 100 μm ouabain had no effect on the [Ca 2 +]i rise upon <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>external</b> Na+. The time course of recovery from a [Ca 2 +]i load mediated by voltage-dependent Ca 2 + influx during depolarization in high K+ was unaffected by the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>external</b> Na+. Cyclopiazonic acid (10 μm), an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase, caused a transient increase in [Ca 2 +]i of 28 ± 11 nm (n= 5), and significantly slowed the recovery from imposed [Ca 2 +]i loads. Iontophoretic injection of orthovanadate, an inhibitor of P-type ATPases including the plasma membrane Ca 2 +-ATPase, caused a persistent increase in the basal [Ca 2 +]i of 163 ± 101 nm (n= 5) in standard saline, and of 427 ± 338 nm in Na+-free saline (n= 5). Vanadate injection significantly slowed the recovery from [Ca 2 +]i loads. <b>Removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>external</b> Na+ during vanadate injection induced an additional, reversible [Ca 2 +]i increase of 254 ± 64 nm (n= 3). The results suggest that the low basal [Ca 2 +]i in these glial cells is predominantly maintained by a Ca 2 +-ATPase in the plasma membrane. This ATPase is also the main Ca 2 + extruder after an intracellular Ca 2 + load, while intracellular stores appear to contribute little to this recovery.

40|$|ABSTRACT The effect <b>of</b> <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>external</b> Ca 2 + on phosphoinositide {{hydrolysis}} {{was investigated}} in cultured myotubes from 92 day 2 old Leghorn embryonic chicken. In the myotubes exposed to Ca 2 + 2 free Ringer′ s solution, the turnover of phosphoinositide was exponentially decreased with a time constant of about 26 min. In the presence <b>of</b> <b>external</b> Ca 2 +, the hydrolysis of phosphoinositide was significantly increased by exposure to 80 mmol / L K+ solution. After <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>external</b> Ca 2 +, 80 mmol / L K+ exposure caused a slight decrease of phosphoinositides hydrolysis {{in comparison with the}} control (normal Ringer). It is indicated that hydrolysis of phosphoinositide in cultured myotubes can be enhanced by high K+ exposure. External Ca 2 + is essential for this effect, which is different from mature muscle fibres. Key words: high K+; Ca 2 + 2 free; phosphoinositide; myotube Inositol phospholipids {{play an important role in}} signal transduction of various cells[1]. Under the action of phosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase C (PI 2 PLC), the phospholipids are hydrolyzed in 2 to two important second messengers[2] : diacylglycerol (DAG) and 1, 4, 52 trisphosphate (IP 3), which can activate PKC[3] and mobilize Ca 2 + from intracellular Ca 2 + store[1], respectively. Several subtypes of PI 2 PLC have been identified, some of which are Ca 2 + 2 dependent [4]. Thus, increasing cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca 2 +] i) may elicit hydrolysis of phosphoinositide.

We present validation of this novel approach and analyses using two anticonvulsants, felbamate and phenobarbital, the effects of which have already been assessed in these models using conventional extracellular recordings.

40|$|The four sperm-specific CatSper {{ion channel}} {{proteins}} {{are required for}} hyperactivated motility and male fertility, and for Ca 2 + entry evoked by alkaline depolarization. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>external</b> Ca 2 +, Na+ carries current through CatSper channels in voltage-clamped sperm. Here we show that CatSper channel activity can be monitored optically with the [Na+]i-reporting probe SBFI in populations <b>of</b> intact sperm. <b>Removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>external</b> Ca 2 + increases SBFI signals in wild-type but not CatSper 2 -null sperm. The rate of the indicated rise of [Na+]i is greater for sperm alkalinized with NH 4 Cl than for sperm acidified with propionic acid, reflecting the alkaline-promoted signature property of CatSper currents. In contrast, the [Na+]i rise is slowed by candidate CatSper blocker HC- 056456 (IC 50 ∼ 3 µM). HC- 056456 similarly slows the rise of [Ca 2 +]i that is evoked by alkaline depolarization and reported by fura- 2. HC- 056456 also selectively and reversibly decreased CatSper currents recorded from patch-clamped sperm. HC- 056456 does not prevent activation of motility by HCO 3 − but does prevent the development of hyperactivated motility by capacitating incubations, thus producing a phenocopy of the CatSper-null sperm. When applied to hyperactivated sperm, HC- 056456 causes a rapid, reversible loss of flagellar waveform asymmetry, similar to the loss that occurs when Ca 2 + entry through the CatSper channel is terminated by <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>external</b> Ca 2 +. Thus, open CatSper channels and entry <b>of</b> <b>external</b> Ca 2 + through them sustains hyperactivated motility.
