40|$|Railways can inevitably cause railway rolling noise, {{which is}} induced by both wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>roughness.</b> Due to the {{deformation}} and wear between the wheel/rail at the contact patch, the <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> may grow in amplitude {{after a number}} of wheelset passages. This results in increasing railway rolling noise. <b>Rail</b> <b>roughness</b> is a common aspect in all transit systems and much research has been pursued to predict and mitigate its growth on track but prediction of resultant noise growth has not been a focus. This paper provides the experimental validation of the modified Railway Rolling Noise Prediction Software (RRNPS) model for the prediction of <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> growth and corresponding noise growth. The model is a new framework to enable noise growth predictions due to <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> growth mechanics. It is validated by means of several experiments that have been performed along a straight railway line. Through comparisons between predictions and measurements, it is shown that the RRNPS model gives reliable predictions on <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> growth and corresponding noise growth. Subsequently this model is used to predict how speed, normal force, wheelset traffic and ballast vertical stiffness affect <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> growth and corresponding noise growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{influences}} of train speed and <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> level on rolling noise and subsurface initiated rolling contact fatigue (RCF) impact are studied. In particular, {{the consequences of}} short-pitch rail corrugation on tangent track with wavelengths in the interval 3 – 8 cm are simulated using models of dynamic vehicle–track interaction. Based on the calculated results, a criterion {{in terms of a}} limit for maximum levels of <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> can be determined. Such a criterion may be useful for planning of rail grinding intervals if used together with a system for regular monitoring of <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> levels. It is concluded that the importance of controlling <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> increases with increasing train speed. Increasing axle loads on freight vehicles from 22. 5 tonnes to 30 tonnes leads to a significant increase in RCF impact. In operational practice, this is usually compensated for by introducing more conformal wheel–rail profile combinations. Calculated vertical wheel–rail contact forces and rolling noise levels show good agreement with field measurement...|$|E

By using a wavelength weighting for measured <b>rail</b> <b>roughness,</b> an improved way of analysing <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> data is also presented [14]. This improves track and rail condition assessments and allows the track engineer to better monitor the track condition.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRailways {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{environmentally}} friendly types of transport. Rail transport requires less energy and emits less hazardous substances, but biggest issues with railways are an environmental noise pollution noise. To reduce this noise different measures could be implemented in different places – at the source, between the source and the receiver, at the receiver. Unfortunately today in Lithuanian rail transport is not very popular mean of transport amongst travellers. Therefore, it is necessary to reconstruct railways lines to increase train speed, comfort for passengers, etc. In order to promote its development, minimal impact on environmental noise pollution must be ensured. Various parameters of track influence the level of emitted noise. This article presents an overview of noise mitigation measures in Lithuanian railway design documentation (<b>rail</b> type, wheel <b>roughness,</b> <b>rail</b> dampers, noise barriers, exchange of brake blocks, rail grinding, noise insulated windows, etc.) and also comparison of their effectiveness...|$|R
30|$|As {{concluded}} by Grassie [20], wear is a main {{material damage}} mechanism of rail corrugation. Most {{of the above}} investigations on rail corrugation were focused on the wavelength fixing mechanism. Research [1, 21, 22] shows that the wavelength fixing mechanism includes the P 2 resonance {{of the interaction between}} wheel and rail, the pinned–pinned resonance of tracks, the second torsional resonance of driven axles, and the transient dynamic interaction between wheel and rail due to initial <b>rail</b> surface <b>roughness.</b> Among these proposed mechanisms, the transient dynamic interaction between wheel and rail is widely accepted. Now, most simulation works on rail corrugation are all based on this mechanism.|$|R

40|$|Surface {{roughness}} on 150 railway {{wheels and}} on the rails of 30 sites in the Netherlands have been measured. Block braked wheels were found to show higher roughnesses than the rail at any site. The smoothest rail is 8 dB smoother than the smoothest wheel. It was concluded that in reducing railway rolling noise NS must start {{to find ways to}} lower wheel roughness. Only after block brakes have been either removed or optimized will the rail require any attention. An exception to this rule is rail corrugation, which was found to occur locally. A good correlation was found between wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> levels and pass-by sound levels.

40|$|In this paper, the Fourier-series {{approach}} is employed to study wheel–rail interactions {{generated by a}} single, or multiple wheels moving at a constant speed along a railway track. This approach has been previously explored by other researchers and what is presented here is an improved version. In this approach, the track is represented by an infinitely long periodic structure with the period equal to the sleeper spacing and the vertical irregular profile (roughness) of the railhead {{is assumed to be}} periodic in the track direction with the period equal to the length of a number (integer), N, of sleeper bays. By assuming linear dynamics for the wheel/track system and for steady state, each wheel/rail force is a periodic function of time and can be expressed as a Fourier series. Fourier coefficients are then shown to be determined by solving, separately, N sets of linear algebraic equations. The coefficient matrix of each set of equations is independent of <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> and therefore this {{approach is}} particularly useful in modelling the generation and growth of <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> of short wavelengths. Excitation purely from the axle loads moving over the periodic track structure is realised by assuming a smooth railhead surface, and subsequently roughness equivalent to such an excitation is defined and evaluated. This equivalent roughness may, in addition to the actual <b>rail</b> <b>roughness,</b> be input into models in which the effect of moving axle loads has been excluded, so that the predictions from those models can be improved. Results are produced using the improved Fourier-series approach to investigate the effects of wheel speeds, roughness wavelengths and interactions between multiple wheels on wheel/rail contact forces...|$|E

Roughness is defined as an additional component of the relative displacement between the wheel and the rail. The amplitude of the random corrugation is 0.1  μm, and the wavelengths were chosen between 2.7 and 67.7  cm, covering the frequency range from 60 to 1500  Hz if the vehicle velocity is 40  m/s.|$|E

30|$|Rail {{corrugation}} is an undulatory wear which occasionally {{occurs on}} the rail rolling surface. The research history of rail corrugation {{can be traced back}} to 1900 s. Since then, many researchers have made gigantic contributions to the understanding of the generation mechanism of rail corrugation. It is well known that the generation mechanism of rail corrugation consists of both the material damage and wavelength fixing mechanisms [1]. Several sagacious concepts have been proposed in the literature, which include the wear law of the frictional power causing rail working surface wear [2], the feedback mechanism for corrugation development [3], the contact filter [4], the pinned–pinned resonance [5], and so on. Specifically, Hempelmann et al. [2] studied rail corrugation, holding an opinion that rail working surface wear is dominated by the wear law of the frictional power. Hempelmann and Knothe [3] extended a linear model to study the short pitch corrugation. Müller [6] studied rail corrugation from the instability of the wheel–rail system. Igeland and Ilias [7] studied rail corrugation from the viewpoint of non-linear interaction between wheel and rail. Knothe and Ripke [8] studied parameter sensitivity of rail corrugation. Andersson and Johansson [9] studied rail corrugation using a three-dimensional wheel–rail interaction model. Johansson and Nielsen [10] studied the influence of powered wheelsets with wheel tread irregularities on rail corrugation. Clark [11] and Brockley [12] studied rail corrugation from the viewpoint of stick–slip vibration of the wheel–rail system. Wu and Thompson [13] attributed rail corrugation to the micro-slip between wheel and rail. Xie and Iwnicki [14] analyzed the railhead wear using a three-dimensional non-Hertzian and non-steady contact model. Daniel and Coworkers [15] discussed the effect of the wheel pass time delay on rail corrugation. Matsumoto [16] and Suda [17] all believed that rail corrugation was probably due to the stick–slip vibration of the wheel–rail system. Sun and Simson [18] studied rail corrugation using an integrated model including <b>rail</b> surface <b>roughness</b> and stick–slip vibration of the wheel–rail system. Jin [19] developed a comprehensive three-dimensional train-track model to study rail corrugation. Contributions from these researchers constitute the theoretical groundwork of rail corrugation.|$|R
40|$|Reliable axlebox based {{measurement}} of <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> {{has been a}} fervent topic of research recently, due to its potential low-cost convenience and network coverage. Present research results for model-based estimation of <b>rail</b> <b>roughness,</b> based on axle-box accelerometers, are presented. A mechanics based model is developed, {{taking into account the}} dynamic characteristics of the track and bogie for estimation of rail profile, based on multiple accelerometer measurements {{on both sides of the}} track. The model is tested and validated against field measurements of rail profile data. In particular, impact response testing of the vehicle (AK car) is first performed to determine the dynamic characteristics of the axlebox in response to various force inputs. This understanding is used to tune the model that is then applied to field accelerometer measurements from left and right axle boxes to predict the rail profiles. The comparison of these measurements with the field profile measurements is performed to reveal the importance of various aspects of the model. The results highlight the importance of considering vibrational input from both sides of the track as well as the effects of speed and track and vehicle dynamic characteristics. The danger of using simplified double integration models, such as substantial speed dependent errors, is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical models linking {{rolling noise}} and surface {{roughness}} {{have been available}} for some 20 years. For even longer, the qualitative link has been acknowledged between the presence of visible corrugation on rail or wheel surfaces and increased noise generation. This roughness, or undulation in the surface profile, has wavelengths of most importance between about 10 and 300 mm, and amplitudes from between about 0. 1 μm and 30 μm - greater for severe corrugation. An important open question in relation to roughness excitation is {{the validity of the}} assumed linear relation between roughness and noise. In part, {{the answer to this question}} depends on the quality and completeness of the roughness measurements. This is illustrated by comparisons of different <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> systems. Special care must also be taken with the processing of roughness data before a representative excitation spectrum can be derived. In this paper experimental evidence from a number of sources is presented to confirm the linear relation between roughness and noise, at least for roughness amplitudes which are not too severe. Attention is also given to the validity of the assumption made in the models that the wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> spectra may be added on an equal basis to give the total roughness spectrum...|$|E
30|$|Having said that, {{the effects}} of the dampers on wheel/rail interactions, <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> growth and noise {{radiation}} from the track are not totally known at the moment (for frequencies between about 450 and 1, 300  Hz, the damper vibrates stronger than the rail at the same position, and noise radiation from the damper may become an issue), although there are claims in the literature that properly designed dampers are beneficial to part, or all, of the above three aspects. This must be fully investigated in the future. The formulae presented in the paper provide a powerful tool to deal with these issues.|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} of vibration impact remains {{as a complex}} challenge for designers of new railway infrastructures. Due to the large quantity of parameters involved in the generation, transmission and reception of the vibration waves, {{it would be necessary}} to develop a complete study for each potential receiver, which would include: source, soil and building characterization, infrastructure vibration behaviour modelling and, finally, countermeasures influence prediction. This process can turn out to be very costly in terms of both time and money. Therefore, it is usually done only for areas very likely to suffer high vibration levels or for high sensitive buildings (hospital, educational). The CATdBTren project, which has been awarded with R&D funding from the Catalonia Government, is aimed to develop a new prediction tool for evaluating the vibration impact from new railway infrastructures as well as to develop new types of fastening systems having high vibration isolation properties. That tool is intended to be user-friendly and to produce results with average accuracy, so it still will be required detailed studies of problematic areas. In this sense, the software will model the contact forces caused by high-speed, conventional and underground rolling stock. Moreover, it will model the infrastructure’s vibration transmission behaviour, ground vibration propagation, terrain-foundation coupling and building vibration mechanism.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the Quiet-Track project is to provide step-changing track based noise mitigation and maintenance schemes for railway rolling noise in LRT (Light Rail Transit) networks. WP 4 in particular focuses on the combination of existing track based solutions to yield a global performance of at least 6. dB(A). The validation was carried out using a track section in the network of Athens Metro Line 1 with an existing outside concrete slab track (RHEDA track) where high airborne rolling noise was observed. The procedure for the selection of mitigation measures is based on numerical simulations, combining WRNOISE and IMMI software tools for noise prediction with experimental determination of the required track and vehicle parameters (e. g., <b>rail</b> and wheel <b>roughness).</b> The availability of a detailed rolling noise calculation procedure allows for detailed designing of measures and of ranking individual measures. It achieves this by including the modelling of the wheel/rail source intensity and of the noise propagation {{with the ability to}} evaluate the effect of modifications at source level (e. g., grinding, rail dampers, wheel dampers, change in resiliency of wheels and/or rail fixation) and of modifications in the propagation path (absorption at the track base, noise barriers, screening). A relevant combination of existing solutions was selected in the function of the simulation results. Three distinct existing solutions were designed in detail aiming at a high rolling noise attenuation and not affecting the normal operation of the metro system: Action 1 : implementation of sound absorbing precast elements (panel type) on the track bed, Action 2 : implementation of an absorbing noise barrier with a height of 1. 10 - 1. 20. m above rail level, and Action 3 : installation of rail dampers.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{economic}} and urban development, the high-speed railway system connecting majorcities {{serves as a}} vital role in the national transportation network. Due to its high speed, punctuality,safety, comfort, high transportation capacity and less land use, it has become a new trend of railwaydevelopment in the world especially in Asian and European countries. We have derived the benefits ofhigh-speed railways since Tokaido Shinkansen as first high-speed railway was began operations inJapan in 1964. The main railway lines usually pass directly over densely populated urban areas orhigh-tech industrial areas, where the railway structure mainly comprises elevated bridges. Consideringthe extremely high speed, the bridge vibration caused by running high-speed train (HST) is concerned. This long-term vibration may cause deterioration of the bridge structures, such as the cracking orexfoliation of concrete. On the other hand, the bridge vibration propagates to the ambient ground viafooting and pile structures, thereby causing long-term environmental problems. Those vibrations oftenbring annoyances to the residents alongside railway lines and malfunction to the vibration-sensitiveequipment housed in the nearby buildings. Furthermore, they can induce the secondary vibration of thebuildings, which seriously affect the structural safety of ancient buildings near the railway lines. Alongwith further urbanization and more rapid transport facilities, there is rising public concern about theenvironmental problems in modern Japan. Therefore, it is quite necessary to clarify the developmentand propagation mechanism of ground vibration caused by running HSTs on the rigid-frame viaducts(RFVs) to find out more effective countermeasures against the HST-induced vibration problems. In this study, the vibration issues related to the train-bridge-ground interaction system: the HSTinducedbridge vibration problem, the environmental vibration problem caused by running HSTs andthe vibration reduction method, have been investigated by the 3 D numerical analysis approach. For the HST-induced bridge vibration problem, {{it is very important to}} perform effective predictionand diagnosis on the HST-induced vibration of either existing bridges or those in the planning stageand obtain some instructive information for the ground vibration analysis as well as the vibrationmitigation analysis. An analytical procedure to simulate the train-bridge coupled vibration problemwith considering the train-bridge interaction (TBI) as well as the effect of ground properties isestablished. The vibration responses of RFVs caused by running HSTs are analyzed in considerationof the wheel-track interaction including the <b>rail</b> surface <b>roughness.</b> The RFVs including the trackstructure are modeled as the 3 D beam elements and simultaneous vibration differential equations ofthe bridge are derived by using modal analysis. The elastic effect of ground springs at the pier bottomsand the connection effect of the sleepers and ballast between the track and the deck slab are modeledwith double nodes connected by springs. A 3 D HST model modeled as multi-DOFs vibration systemthat can appropriately express the lateral, vertical and rotational motions of the car body and bogies isdeveloped for the analyses. Newmark’s β method for direct numerical integration is applied to solvethe vibration differential equations. For the validation of the developed 3 D HST model and theanalytical approach, the vibration response analysis of the TBI system is carried out and the analyticalresults are compared with experimental ones. Based on the simulation of TBI, the vibrationcharacteristics of the RFVs in both vertical and lateral directions including the fact where predominantvibration occurs are clarified. Frequency characteristics are clarified by Fourier spectral analysis and 1 / 3 octave band spectral analysis. Furthermore, the parametric study of bridge vibration caused byrunning HSTs is performed to examine the vibration influences of different factors including trainspeeds, train types, track irregularities, rail types and damping based on their analytical results. For the environmental vibration problem caused by running HSTs, based on the developedanalytical procedure for the TBI, an approach to simulate ground vibration around the RFVs of thehigh-speed railway is established with considering the vibration interactions between the train and thebridge as well as the foundation and the ground. The TBI model established preciously is convenientlyused in this analysis. The entire train-bridge-ground interaction system is divided into two subsystems:the train-bridge interaction and the soil-structure interaction (SSI). In the stage of the TBI problem, thevibration responses of RFVs are simulated to obtain the vibration reaction forces at the pier bottoms ofiiRFVs. Then, applying those vibration reaction forces as input excitation forces in the SSI problem, theground vibration around the RFVs in both vertical and lateral directions is simulated and evaluated bymeans of using a general-purpose program named SASSI 2000. Based on the simulation of TBI andSSI, the characteristics of ground vibration including the fact where predominant vibration occurs areclarified. The ground vibration is rapidly attenuated along with the increase of propagation distance inthe near field and their vibration influence in the vertical direction is much more serious than that inthe lateral direction. The predominant frequency components are basically same for differentobservation points and they are determined by those of bridge vibration. Frequency characteristics arealso clarified by Fourier spectral analysis and 1 / 3 octave band spectral analysis. It is verified that theprimary vibration frequency component is dependent on the speed of HST in relation to the length ofcar and the higher frequency components are integer multiples of the primary one. The lowerfrequency band mainly exists in the vicinity of bridge piers and reduces quickly along with theincrease of propagation distance. The lateral vibration is mainly affected by the higher frequencycomponents. Furthermore, the parametric study of ground vibration caused by running HSTs is alsocarried out to examine the vibration influences of different factors including train speeds, train types,track irregularities, rail types and damping based on their numerical results. Based on the vibration characteristics related to the above-mentioned vibration issues, two kinds ofvibration reduction countermeasure are proposed to reduce the HST-induced vibration to meet therequirement of environmental vibration. One kind is to reinforce the hanging parts of RFVs to firstlyreduce the HST-induced bridge vibration. The other one is to install a new barrier called reinforcedconcrete vibration isolation unit (RCVIU) to directly isolate the HST-induced ground vibration. Then,according to 3 D numerical analysis approach of the entire train-bridge-ground interaction system, themitigation analyses are carried out to comparatively investigate the HST-induced vibration responsesfor three reinforcement methods and a double-layer RCVIU. Their vibration screening efficiencies areevaluated by the reduction of vibration acceleration level (VAL) based on 1 / 3 octave band spectralanalysis and the reduction factor on the maximum acceleration from three aspects such as vibrationfrequency, train speed and propagation distance. Furthermore, the combined vibration reductionmethod with strut and RCVIU is proposed to involve the source motion control and the wavepropagation obstruction. It is an effective vibration reduction method to reduce the HST-inducedground vibration around the RFVs in both vertical and lateral directions. The reduction of VAL is 9. 67 dB and 2. 78 dB at 25 m in the vertical and lateral direction, respectively. In particular, aboutvibration frequency, it is more effective to mitigate the ground vibration at 25 m in the lower frequencyband and the high frequency band such as 1 - 2. 5 Hz and 6 - 25 Hz. The largest reduction of VAL is 11. 35 dB at 8 Hz and 13. 68 dB at 12. 5 Hz in the vertical and lateral direction, respectively. But it is smallaround the primary frequency component 3. 15 Hz. According to the ground vibration response, the environmental vibration evaluation is performedby means of the VAL from two aspects: vibration frequency and train speed. Taking advantage of thefrequency-dependent base curves of perceptible vibration from ISO 2631 - 2 : 1989 and the threshold 70 dB of environmental vibration for Shinkansen railway in Japan, the environmental vibration iscomparatively investigated through the 1 / 3 octave band spectral analysis. The parametric effectsincluding train speeds, train types, track irregularities, rail types and damping are also investigated forthe environmental vibration caused by running HSTs. Furthermore, the assessment for vibrationreduction methods is carried out to clarify the effectiveness of improvement of environmentalvibration. The results show: the VALs in the lateral direction are below the base curves and far lessthan those in the vertical direction; the VALs in the vertical direction easily exceed the smallest basecurves in the range of 8 Hz to 25 Hz and the threshold 70 dB at the border for Shinkansen railway. Thevarious impact factors can cause the change of the HST-induced vibration but the change for the railtype is very small. In particular, the train speed can easily cause the variation of predominantfrequency components; the train type and damping ratio can easily cause the variation of magnitudes;track irregularity can cause the variation of both predominant frequency components and magnitudes. Finally, the application of vibration reduction countermeasures is useful to reduce the HST-inducedvibration to satisfy the requirement of environmental vibration in the vibration-sensitive areas...|$|R

However, the rail length that can be covered is limited and surveying a wide network turns {{out not to be}} practical. On the other hand, indirect methods based on acceleration measurements may be used for monitoring purposes. In this paper, the feasibility of roughness measurements based on interferometric techniques is discussed. Such a measurement could be carried out at normal train operation speed. The problems of optical measurements in real-time conditions are taken in due consideration. A key point of the discussion is the use of a system for vibration attenuation to be mounted under a vehicle to suspend the optical sensing device. The structure for a complete measurement device is proposed together with the expected performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Environmental factors, {{especially}} {{humidity and}} temperature, may influence wheel/rail contact behaviours {{by changing the}} friction coefficient, resulting in railway rolling noise changes. Friction modifiers (FMs) are now commonly used in the railway industry to manage and/or mitigate <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> growth and high noise levels in curves. Although the three factors {{have the potential to}} reduce rolling noise, there is little corresponding quantification of their effects available. In this paper, a series of experiments were performed with a two disk test rig to investigate their effect on rolling noise. A Railway Rolling Noise Prediction Software (RRNPS) model is then modified to simulate it. It is noted that the effect of humidity, temperature and FMs is small to negligible under the present conditions tested. However, through comparisons between simulations and measurements, the modified RRNPS model can reasonably predict the trend of the three factors effect on rolling noise. This may provide useful insight to the control of railway noise...|$|E
40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird ein akustisches Emissionsmodell für Schienenverkehrslärm vorgestellt. Das Modell ermöglicht die präzise Berechnung von Emissionspegeln unter Berücksichtigung aller relevanten Einflussgrößen. Die Emissionspegel werden als Schallleistungsspektren für fünf Quellenhöhen bestimmt. Das Rollgeräusch wird unter Verwendung von Rauheitsspektren für Rad und Schiene berechnet. Es erfolgt eine Unterteilung des Gesamtrollgeräusches in Oberbau- und Fahrzeuganteile. Der Einfluss verschiedener Oberbautypen wird durch Transferfunktionen berücksichtigt. Für elf Fahrzeugkategorien werden Standardwerte der sekundären Geräuschquellen angegeben. Alle Modellparameter können durch nutzerspezifische Daten beliebig erweitert werden. Die Modellerstellung basiert auf normgerechten, akustischen Messungen der wesentlichen Einflussgrößen: Vorbeifahrtpegel, Rad-/Schienenrauheiten und Gleisabklingraten. Durchführung, Auswertung und Analyse der Messungen werden in dieser Arbeit dokumentiert. Der Einfluss von Rauheiten und Gleisabklingrate auf das Rollgeräusch wird vertieft dargestellt. Weiterführend werden Methoden zur indirekten Messung von Rad- und Schienenrauheiten an vorbeifahrenden Zügen entwickelt. Anhand von Beispielen wird deren Beitrag zur Lärmprognose innerhalb des erstellten Emissionsmodells gezeigt. Within the {{framework}} of the present work, an emissions model for railway noise was developed. It was possible to produce an acoustic emissions model which allows the calculation of sound power levels in 5 source levels. The model calculation takes into account the essential factors influencing noise generation. These primarily include the type of vehicle and type of track, the roughness of wheels and rails, routing parameters and speed of travel. The calculations in the emissions model can be made using standard values or user-specific data. This means {{that it is possible to}} extend the emissions model as required with regard to roughness data, vehicle types and track types. On the basis of extensive acoustic measurements, an emissions model has been generated to map the acoustic characteristics of vehicles, route sections and routing parameters. The present work documents the planning and assessment of the measurement campaigns undertaken, defines the algorithms and validates the emissions model established, using the results of the measurements. The variables for emissions calculations are analysed using numerous examples. The focus of the analysis is the effect of wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> on the acoustic emission properties of rail vehicles. Two methodes for the indirect wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> measurement are presented. Specific examples of applications are used to show how assessment of noise abatement measures can be carried out using forecasting tools...|$|E
40|$|A {{new model}} for {{simulating}} <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> growth on tangent track {{is presented in}} this paper. The model consists of three relatively independent components: (1) a time-domain vehicle/track interaction model; (2) a 2 D non-Hertzian and non-steady wheel/rail contact model; and (3) a wear model. Wheel/rail contact forces for a given initial roughness obtained from the vehicle/track interaction model are used by the contact model to calculate the contact patch size, normal pressure and tangential stresses with material removal assumed to be linearly proportional to the friction work in the contact patch. The roughness profile is updated and fed back into vehicle/track interaction model. The 2 D contact model is initially compared with a 3 D model for various wavelength of initial sinusoidal roughness. Long term roughness growth is then simulated with the 2 D contact model. Simulation shows that all initial sinusoidal roughness of wavelengths between 20 – 100 mm are levelled out. The wavelength-fixing mechanism, that has previously been used to explain the cause of corrugation, is {{not found in the}} present investigations...|$|E
40|$|A time-domain {{model for}} the {{prediction}} of long-term growth of <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> (corrugation) on small radius curves is presented. Both low-frequency vehicle dynamics due to curving and high-frequency vehicle–track dynamics excited by short-wavelength rail irregularities are accounted for. The influence of non-Hertzian and non-steady effects in the wheel–rail contact model on rail wear is studied. The model features a contact detection method that accounts for wheelset yaw angle as well as surface irregularities and structural flexibilities of wheelset and rail. The development of corrugation on a small radius curve {{is found to be}} highly influenced by the wheel–rail friction coefficient. For vehicle speed 25 km/h and friction coefficient 0. 3, predictions of long-term roughness growth on the low rail show decreasing magnitudes in the entire studied wavelength interval. For friction coefficient 0. 6, roughness growth is found at several wavelengths. The corresponding calculation for the high rail contact of the trailing wheelset indicates no roughness growth independent of friction coefficient. The importance of accounting for the phase between the calculated wear and the present rail irregularity is demonstrated...|$|E
30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the pinned–pinned {{frequency}} at 1, 070  Hz (indicated by letter A) of the original track disappears, as expected, thanks to the dampers. However, the installation of the dampers generates two new peaks (indicated by letters B and C). Peak B corresponds to the bounding frequency B shown in Fig.  7 b. At this frequency, sleepers behave like pins and the point at the mid-way (that is the position of the damper) between two neighboring sleepers has the maximum response across the span defined by these two sleepers. In other words, the pinned–pinned frequency of the original track is shifted down to a much lower value by the dampers. Peak C, at about 1, 250  Hz, corresponds to the bounding frequency C shown in Fig.  7 b. At this frequency, dampers behave like pins and the point at the mid-way (that is the position of the sleeper) between two neighboring dampers has the maximum response. Thus this is a pinned–pinned frequency created by the dampers. The effect of these two pinned–pinned frequencies on <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> growth is unknown at the moment, and to be investigated in the future.|$|E
30|$|Most of {{the above}} studies {{regarded}} wheel as a rigid body when carrying out the wheel wear prediction. However, when the vehicle passed through a small radius curve, the influence of wheel profiles on the wheel–rail normal force, the contact patch size, position of the contact point, adhesion area, {{and the distribution of}} the slide area were different for a flexible wheelset and a rigid wheelset. Chang et al. [17] studied the wheel–rail wear by establishing a three-dimensional dynamic finite element model. Baeza et al. [18] built a model that coupled rotating flexible wheelset and a flexible track model for simulating vehicle–track interaction at high frequencies when investigating growth in <b>rail</b> <b>roughness.</b> Due to the increase of the vehicle speed and the presence of roughness, contact geometry perturbations induce a variation of forces in the vertical and tangential direction, and the torsional vibration of the wheelset axle may, therefore, be excited at high frequency. These vibrations directly affect the contact dynamic action of wheel/rail, and then influence on the wheel profile wear. Therefore, in the prediction of wheel profile wear, wheelset should be considered as flexible body.|$|E
40|$|When {{predicting}} {{rolling noise}} due to wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> a “contact filter” is generally applied {{to account for}} the effect of the finite size of the wheel/rail contact. For time-domain analysis these calculations must be fast enough to get results in a reasonable time. Remington and Webb have devised a versatile three-dimensional ‘distributed point reacting spring’ (DPRS) contact model that is relatively quick, but if only one line of data is available along the contact it is unnecessarily complex, so a simpler two-dimensional version has been developed here. When this new model was checked against a Boussinesq analysis of the contact, the results in one-third octave bands were found to agree to within 3 dB. These results further suggest that the two-dimensional DPRS model might have an unexpectedly wide range of applicability, including large amplitude sinusoidal roughness and discrete features such as a rail joint. When implemented at each step in a time-domain wheel/rail interaction analysis, this model gave similar results to quasi-static roughness filtering with a constant load for moderate roughness, but dynamic effects became significant when the roughness amplitudes were large, particularly with dipped rail joints...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{main source}} of noise from railway at {{conventional}} speeds is rolling noise. The wheel and the rail surfaces are not perfectly smooth, but contain small-amplitude roughness. This roughness causes vibration of the wheel and rail which radiate noise. Within the LECAV project (LECture Acoustique de la Voie, i. e. Acoustic reading of railway track) a method is developed to use the sound radiated by the wheel and the rail to characterize acoustics parameters of wheel track system during train running. These parameters will allow estimating <b>rail</b> <b>roughness</b> spectrum and potentially track decay rate. This method requires to have control over the acoustic radiation of the wheel and rail in order to estimate the interaction force between the two elements in the contact zone. The {{first part of this}} communication is devoted to the presentation of a measurement campaign that has been carried out on a test train parked on a railway track. The second part of the paper deals with the post-processing method. Results of the estimated excitation force from the simultaneous measurement of the acoustic sound pressure and vibration of the wheel are compared to the measured one to validate the metho...|$|E
40|$|A floating-slab {{track with}} {{discontinuous}} slab provides a spatially-varying stiffness under a constant moving load. When a train moves {{on such a}} track, even with the absence of <b>rail</b> <b>roughness,</b> a parametric excitation develops as wheels {{move up and down}} applying dynamic forces at the wheel-rail interface. The dynamic force is magnified if one of its principal frequencies matches with any of the train or the track resonance frequencies. In this paper, a new method based on a Fourier series representation is developed to couple a moving train to a track with discontinuous slab. A two-degree-of-freedom system is used to model a quarter of a train with four axles and two bogies moving on a track with constant velocity. The purpose of this work is to investigate the dynamic effect of slab discontinuity on trains running in underground railway tunnels, where the velocity is less than 100 km/hr. For typical parameters of a train and a track, it is found that the force at the wheel-rail interface is only increased by 1 % of its static value due to slab discontinuity. However, the dynamic effect may be more important in circumstances where high-speed or heavy-axled trains are used in underground tunnels. <br/...|$|E
