5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E
5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal {{in this area is}} often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> are found.|$|E
5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> in {{cold rolling}} could {{decrease}} {{the accuracy of}} ring parts. Because many factors could cause <b>residual</b> <b>stress,</b> it’s difficult to calculate it theoretically. At present, a measurement method was generally used to study the <b>residual</b> <b>stress.</b> For example, X ray {{could be used to}} measure <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> in rings. Through the measurement of <b>residual</b> <b>stress,</b> it could not only obtain the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> level after ring rolling, but also validate the finite element model to predict the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> distribution. However, because the ring surface was circle, it needs to cut a plane for X ray measure, and it increases measurement inaccuracy. This method only could be suited for qualitative analysis of <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> in cold ring rolling, and it is not suitable for quantitative analysis of <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> distribution...|$|R

It is found that: (i) the yield strength of incipient plasticity increases with compressive <b>residual</b> <b>stress,</b> but decreases with tensile residual stress; (ii) the hardness decreases with tensile <b>residual</b> <b>stress,</b> and increases with compressive <b>residual</b> <b>stress,</b> but abruptly drops {{down at a}} higher compressive <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> level, because of {{the deterioration of the}} surface; (iii) the indentation modulus reduces linearly with decreasing compressive <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> (and with increasing tensile <b>residual</b> <b>stress).</b> It can be concluded from the MD simulations that the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> not only strongly influences the dislocation evolution of the plastic deformation process, but also significantly affects the size of the plastic zone...|$|R
5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, <b>residual</b> <b>stresses,</b> and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{defects in}} this category: hot tears and hot spots. Hot tears, {{also known as}} , are {{failures}} in the casting that occur as the casting cools. This happens because the metal is weak when it is hot and the <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> in the material can cause the casting to fail as it cools. Proper mold design prevents this type of defect.|$|E

The structure will be permanently deformed when the load is removed, and may have <b>residual</b> <b>stresses.</b> Engineering metals display strain hardening, which implies that the yield stress is increased after unloading from a yield state. Highly optimized structures, such as airplane beams and components, rely on yielding as a fail-safe failure mode. No safety factor is therefore needed when comparing limit loads (the highest loads expected during normal operation) to yield criteria.|$|E

Laser peening is unlike the other manufacturing processes in that it neither heats or adds material; it is a mechanical process of cold working the metallic component to impart compressive <b>residual</b> <b>stresses.</b> Laser peening is widely used in gas fired turbine engines in both aerospace and power generation for component damage tolerance improvement and fatigue life and strength increase.|$|E

In this cyclic loading condition, micro crack/flaws may be generated at the interface of the matrix and the filler. This micro crack can initiate permanent plastic deformation which results in large crack propagation or failure. During the cyclic load several factor also contribute to microcrack generation such as frictional sliding of the mating surface, progressive wear, <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> at grain boundaries, stress due to shear.|$|E

25|$|The corium {{undergoes}} degradation. The Elephant's Foot, {{hard and}} strong shortly after its formation, is now cracked enough that a glue-treated wad easily separated its top 1–2 centimeter layer. The structure's shape itself is changed as the material slides down and settles.

The heterogeneous nature of corium and different thermal expansion coefficients of the components causes material deterioration with thermal cycling.
