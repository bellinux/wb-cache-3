40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} scheme and prototype test {{results of a}} broadband <b>radioastronomy</b> <b>receiver</b> aimed to obtain polarisation data of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation from the sky. Nominal receiver bandwidth is 26 to 36 GHz. The radiometer will work as a polarimeter to obtain the polarisation Stokes parameters (Q, U and I) of the incoming electromagnetic signal to the feed-horns. Prototype tests have demonstrated the receiver concept based on electronic phase switching in two balanced branches. The correlation between signals is performed directly at 31 GHz by a broadband 3 dB/ 180 º hybrid coupler...|$|E
40|$|A {{classical}} <b>radioastronomy</b> <b>receiver</b> is {{fed with}} a corrugated horn {{and an independent}} lens, both placed in a cryostat to lower the noise temperature. The beam is focused and directed {{using a combination of}} elliptical and plane mirrors. This paper proposes modifying the initial feeding system by placing the lens onto the horn aperture, thereby allowing a size reduction of the horn and lens, and a simplification of their mechanical design. The profiled lens is shaped to correct the phase error on the horn aperture. A quasi-optical model of the horn-plus-lens system has been developed using a Beam Mode Expansion (BME). Results using both a hyperbolic-planar lens and a spherical-elliptical lens, as well as results obtained by using Geometrical Optics (GO) with a Kirchoff–Huygens integration to get the far-field pattern, have been compared with measurements. As a direct application, a full focusing system for the new 40 -m radiotelescope at the “Centro Astron´omico de Yebes” is presented for the 22, 30 and 45 GHz bands. This paper has developed a QO model for a corrugated conical horn with a phase-correcting lens...|$|E

40|$|Cryogenically cooled HEMT (High Electron Mobility Transistor) {{amplifiers}} find {{widespread use}} in <b>radioastronomy</b> <b>receivers.</b> In recent years, these devices {{have also been}} commonly employed in broadband receivers for precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. In this setting, the combination of ultra-low-noise and low-spectral-resolution observations reinforce the importance achieving suitable control over the device environment to achieve fundamentally limited receiver performance. The influence of the intrinsic amplifier stability at low frequencies on data quality (e. g., achievable noise and residual temporal correlations), observational and calibration strategies, as well as architectural mitigation approaches in this setting will be discussed. The implications of device level 1 /f fluctuations {{reported in the literature}} on system performance will be reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Conferencia invitada; Bisannual {{conference of}} the French National Programme INSU/PCMI- Physique et Chimie des Milieux Interstellaire et Circumstellaire; Lille, October 24 - 28, 2016 In this work we prove the {{viability}} of the use of standard <b>radioastronomy</b> <b>receivers</b> to detect rotational spectral lines emitted at room temperatures by different molecular precursors and plasma products introduced or generated in a low pressure plasma chamber, placed in the beam path of the 40 m Yebes observatory radio telescope operating in the Q band (41 - 49 GHz). Right and left circular polarization signals were sampled over 500 MHz bandwith. The data acquisition was performed with a Fast Fourier Transform Spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 30 kHz. Depending on the weather conditions, the background for emission measurements came from the antenna pointing towards the zenith (clear blue sky) or from a near blackbody load at liquid N 2 temperature (cloudy or rainy weather), implying 42 K or 70 K temperatures, respectively, at 45 GHz. The plasma was produced in a cylindrical, 25 cm diameter, 42 cm length, stainless steel vacuum chamber by an inductively coupled (5 - 60 W, 13. 56 MHz) RF discharge, stablished through a refrigerated copper coil (4 turns, 10 cm length, 17 cm diameter) inserted axially and located where the gaussian beam of the receivers narrows to its minimum width. Windows of 75 ¿m thickness ¿ 22 cm diameter made of Upilex were placed {{at both ends of the}} chamber at slightly divergent planes to avoid standing waves. A differentially pumped quadrupole mass spectrometer (0 - 100 amu) allowed to identify the stable species introduced or generated during the on/off plasma intervals and follow their time evolution. Gas pressures of ¿ 0. 7 - 90 Pa produced similar column densities to those of a typical hot core ¿ 1015 - 16 cm- 2. A pressure range of ¿ 10 - 30 Pa at gas flow conditions proved to be more appropriate during plasma operation. OCS and CH 3 OH, which have quite different line intensities, were selected for static gas detection in the observing emission band, displaying maximum equivalent radiation temperatures of ¿ 4 K for carbonyl sulfide and 0. 3 K for methanol. In the lower pressure regime, the linewidths were mainly due to thermal broadening and at high pressure they were dominated by pressure broadening. OCS and CS 2 were selected as plasma precursors of the CS radical, which emits also in the 41 - 49 GHz region and was regularly detected at different plasma conditions, with equivalent temperatures up to 4 K. O 2 discharges applied after sulfur deposition in the reactor walls by the previous S rich containing plasmas allowed to generate SO 2 by heterogeneous plasma processes and detect its rotational transitions in different vibrational (bending) states v 2 = 0, 1, 2; the intensity of the transitions from upper levels increasing with discharge power. With the plasma ON no spurious signals were induced in the resulting spectra from electromagnetic coupling of the RF discharge with the IF signal generated by the receivers. In conclusion, these experiments confirm the applicability of standard radioastronmy receivers to detect molecular and short lived neutrals in plasma reactors and gas simulation chambers...|$|R
