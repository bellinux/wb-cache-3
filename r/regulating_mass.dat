In order to propose its definition, the author analysed the civil code provisions regulating the institution of standard terms (art. 384), the unfair terms in consumer contracts (art. and the provisions of the Council Directive 93 / 13 /EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts. Based on the institution of standard terms in consumer contracts, three major issues have been flagged out: 1) the content of standard terms in consumer contracts; 2) the manner of their edition; 3) the medium of transfer. It has been concluded that only the content of the standard terms in consumer contracts is controlled by the institution of unfair terms in consumer contracts (art. 385 '- 3853 k. c.). In the author’s opinion the Civil Code has introduced the principle of freedom in regard to the way both of edition (art. 384) and the type of the transfer media (art. 60). Further, the author states that the term “standard terms in consumer contracts” is a declaration of will made by the entrepreneur, or the enterprise, <b>regulating</b> <b>mass</b> goods within the scope of his specific, professional business activity.

40|$|Anabolic and catabolic {{markers of}} muscle protein {{metabolism}} {{were examined in}} inactivity-induced atrophying muscles with and without daily short-duration, high-resistance isometric contractions. Inactivity was achieved via spinal cord isolation (SI), which results in near inactivity of the hindlimb musculature without compromising the motoneuron-muscle connectivity. Adult rats were assigned to a control (Con) or SI group in which one limb was stimulated (SI-Stim, 5 consecutive days of brief bouts of high-load isometric contractions) while the other served as a SI control (SI). Both the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus weights (relative to body weight) were ∼ 71 % of Con in the SI, but maintained at Con in the SI-Stim group. Activity of the IGF- 1 /phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt pathway of protein synthesis was similar among all groups in the MG. Expression of atrogin- 1 and muscle RING finger- 1 (MuRF- 1), markers of protein degradation, {{were higher in the}} MG and soleus of the SI than Con and maintained at Con in the SI-Stim. Compared with Con, the anti-growth factor myostatin was unaffected in the MG and soleus in the SI but was lower in the MG of the SI-Stim. These results demonstrate that upregulation of specific protein catabolic pathways plays a critical role in SI-induced atrophy, while this response was blunted by 4 min of daily high-resistance electromechanical stimulation and was able to preserve most of the muscle mass. Although the protein anabolic pathway (IGF- 1 /PI 3 K/Akt) appears to play a minor role in <b>regulating</b> <b>mass</b> in the SI model, increased translational capacity may have contributed to mass preservation in response to isometric contractions...|$|E
40|$|Both {{water depth}} and litter quality are {{important}} factors influencing litter decomposition in wetlands, but the interactive role {{of these factors}} in <b>regulating</b> <b>mass</b> loss and nutrient dynamics is far from clear. The responses of mass loss and nutrient dynamics to simulated water depths and litter quality are investigated in leaves of Carex brevicuspis and leaves and stems of Miscanthus sacchariflorus from the Dongting Lake, China. Three litter types differing in litter quality were incubated for 210 days at three water depths (0 cm, 5 cm, and 80 cm, relative to the water surface) in a pond near the Dongting Lake. The litter mass remaining, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), organic carbon (organic C), cellulose, and lignin contents were analyzed during the controlled decomposition experiment. Moreover, water properties (temperature, dissolved oxygen content, and conductivity) and fungal biomass were also characterized. Initial N and P contents were highest in C. brevicuspis leaves, intermediate in M. sacchariflorus leaves and lowest in M. sacchariflorus stems, whereas the organic C, cellulose, and lignin contents exhibited an opposite trend. After a 210 days incubation, decomposition rate was highest in M. sacchariflorus leaves (0. 0034 – 0. 0090 g g - 1 DW day - 1, in exponential decay model), intermediate in C. brevicuspis leaves (0. 0019 – 0. 0041 g g - 1 DW day - 1), and lowest in M. sacchariflorus stems (0. 0005 – 0. 0011 g g - 1 DW day - 1). Decomposition rate of C. brevicuspis leaves was highest at 5 cm water depth, intermediate at 80 cm, and lowest at 0 cm. Decomposition rate of M. sacchariflorus leaves was higher at 5 cm, and 80 cm than at 0 cm water depths. Water depth {{had no effect on}} decomposition of M. sacchariflorus stems. At the end of incubation, N and P mineralization was completely in leaf litters with increasing rates along with increasing water depth, while nutrients were accumulated in M. sacchariflorus stem. Organic C, cellulose, and lignin decayed quickly in both leaf litters compared to the stem litter. The fungal biomass was higher in leaf than in stem litters and changed as a response to water depth in both leaf litters rather than stem ones.

40|$|Despite being famously {{overpopulated}} with characters, nineteenth-century {{novels are}} typically read {{in terms of}} the individual. Addressing this incongruity, “Genres of Population: Biopolitics and the Victorian Novel” examines how novels imagine the human mass in an era of rapid demographic growth. My dissertation argues that Victorian novels conceptualize the population by turning a seemingly inscrutable collective into an object of knowledge and control. I contend that biopolitics—Michel Foucault’s term for the discourses and practices of managing lives—depends on novels to articulate the conditions, methods, and experiences of demographic regulation. Though attempts to enumerate the English population date back to the 1085 Domesday Book, the first census of 1801 made demographic information available at unprecedented levels. The census launched an age of population management that, I assert, influenced and was influenced by novels. Analyzing what I call narratives of demographic crises, my project shows how Victorian novels depict the population as intractable yet governable—prone to chaos, degeneration, and extinction while also amenable to governmental intervention. Extending Foucault’s claim that biopolitical theories and mechanisms emerged in the nineteenth century, “Genres of Population” examines the historical roots of biopower, situating its early moments in a century known for its state paternalism, statistical advances, and social reforms. Even as Foucault locates the concept in the nineteenth century, scholarship on biopolitics tends to focus on the present or recent past. By contrast, I historicize biopolitics and demonstrate how Victorian novels portray the population as a collective to be protected. While Victorians had their own terms for this collective—such as the social body, the aggregate, and the crowd—I call this collective the population so as to emphasize the state’s role in its management. My research thus challenges the usual approach of studying biopolitics in a twentieth- and twenty-first-century setting and the usual critique that the novel is a genre that posits the individual as an agentive subject. In revealing the confluence of Victorian fiction and biopolitical thought, my project exposes the nineteenth-century literary influences of population discourses. To track how novels form the concept of a governable population, I analyze a diverse set of texts—from social problem novels, where one would expect to find representations of the population, to sensation novels, where the population is no less important but less obviously an issue. I focus each chapter on a novelistic subgenre and an aspect of demographic control. By pairing form with history, I show how each subgenre reacts to the historical circumstances affecting the population. The first three chapters illuminate how social problem, sensation, and slum novels construct ideas of the population in response to advances in statistics and demography, changes in family structure and reproduction, and movements for housing reform. The final chapter departs from discussing novels’ roles in molding the population into an object of state power by offering the socialist novel {{as an example of how}} novels participate in creating rather than <b>regulating</b> <b>mass</b> life. These chapters illustrate Victorian novels’ contribution to theories of population management, ultimately revising our narratives about the rise of demography and the novel. Chapter 1 examines Elizabeth Gaskell’s and Charles Dickens’s social problem novels, Mary Barton and Bleak House, to consider how statistical counting impacts the state’s ability to oversee the population. Gaskell’s working-class radical John Barton and Dickens’s vagrant Jo show how the abstraction necessary to quantify the population also obscures attempts to know it. Continuing to explore the effects of counting and the census, chapter 2 analyzes the household as a tool for population management via readings of Wilkie Collins’s The Woman in White and Ellen Wood’s The Shadow of Ashlydyat. The household emerges in these sensation novels as the preferred avenue for perpetuating the population, as the aristocratic family becomes associated with antiquated ideas about patrimony, reproduction, and land ownership. Chapter 3 also looks at the unit of the household but in the setting of slum fiction; in it, I show how housing reform colludes with the state’s efforts to track the population. Focusing on George Gissing’s The Nether World and Arthur Morrison’s A Child of the Jago, I explain how these texts use cartographic language to turn the population into a spatial entity. My final chapter departs from emphasizing control to exploring how socialist novels redeploy biopolitical ideas to imagine a social body that circumvents state power. The utopia in William Morris’s News from Nowhere and the cultural center in Walter Besant’s All Sorts and Conditions of Men offer alternative forms of mass organization...|$|E

Serotonin levels were inversely associated with body and spine aBMD (age-adjusted R = − 0. 17 and − 0. 16, P <. 01, respectively) and with femur neck total and trabecular vBMD (age-adjusted R = − 0. 17 and − 0. 25, P <. 01 and <. 001, respectively) but not lumbar spine vBMD.
