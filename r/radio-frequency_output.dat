50|$|Since the NTIA did {{not require}} CECBs to output MTS stereo signals via their <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>output,</b> THAT Corporation noted that {{consumers}} using RF-only connections with CECBs will lose stereo TV sound. This problem may be avoided by using the converter's line level audio outputs.|$|E
40|$|The {{regions of}} {{validity}} of the Markov approximation for the coupling of atoms out of an atomic trap are determined. We consider <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>output</b> coupling {{in the presence of}} gravity and collisional repulsion, and Raman output coupling. The Markov approximation is crucial in most theoretical descriptions of an atom laser that assume a continuous process of output coupling from a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. In this regime many techniques proved to be useful for modeling the optical laser, such as master equations, can be used to describe the dynamics of the damping of the condensate mode undergoing output coupling.

30|$|A {{radio-frequency}} heating device (Model RH- 3 T, Yamamoto Vinita Co. Ltd.) {{was used to}} generate radio frequency. Its power output was set at 1  kW. The <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>output</b> was started when the board thickness reached 10 or 30  mm. A radio-frequency device has a variable condenser to measure the moisture content in a board during {{radio-frequency heating}}. The value of the variable condenser ranges from 0 to 100  %. The value during the initial pressing stage was about 30  % and increased with decreasing moisture content inside the board. When the value was 100  %, the moisture dried up completely. Beyond 100  %, more heating caused burning, thereby adversely affecting the board properties [11]. Therefore, radio-frequency heating was stopped at 100  %, with radio frequency being stopped for the final 5  s of the pressing time at less than 100  %.|$|E
50|$|A large Alexanderson {{alternator}} {{might produce}} 500 kW of <b>output</b> <b>radio-frequency</b> energy {{and would be}} water- or oil-cooled. One such machine had 600 pole pairs in the stator winding, and the rotor was driven at 2170 RPM, for an output frequency near 21.7 kHz. To obtain higher frequencies, higher rotor speeds were required, up to 20,000 RPM.|$|R
30|$|The {{radio-frequency}} {{hot press}} increased the {{internal bond strength}} of even the 20 -mm ARH board at a short pressing time, but the internal bond strength at 0.554  MPa at 4  min was not high. Further, the internal bond strength of the 10 -mm ARH board was 0.678  MPa at 2  min (Fig.  4). Thus, the internal bond strength of the 20 -mm board was {{lower than that of}} the 10 -mm board even when the radio-frequency hot press was used. This suggests that the <b>radio-frequency</b> power <b>output</b> must be increased to improve the internal bond strength of thicker boards, given that the power output was set at 1  kW in this study.|$|R
50|$|A {{magic eye}} tube or tuning indicator, in {{technical}} literature called an electron-ray indicator tube, is a vacuum tube which gives a visual {{indication of the}} amplitude of an electronic signal, such as an audio <b>output,</b> <b>radio-frequency</b> signal strength, or other functions. The magic eye (also called a cat's eye, or tuning eye in North America) is {{a specific type of}} such a tube with a circular display similar to the EM34 illustrated. Its first broad application was as a tuning indicator in radio receivers, to give an indication of the relative strength of the received radio signal, to show when a radio station was properly tuned in.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an efficient design method for predicting the bandwidth of traveling-wave photodetectors (TWPD's) in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) coplanar technology, First the transmission-line parameters describing the propagation mechanism {{in the structure}} are computed up to optical Frequencies, {{as a function of}} the geometry and of the carrier concentrations. Next, a traveling-wave equivalent model is derived, which takes into account the propagation mechanism of the optical beam into the silicon active area and the carriers transit time in the p-i-n junction. Using the model enables us to theoretically optimize the <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>output</b> power of the p-i-n structure over a wide frequency range by a judicious choice of the optical and RF loads at the accesses of the equivalent opto-electronic coupler formed by the TWPD, SOI coplanar TWPD's supporting a traveling optical wave exhibit an improvement of the 3 -dB bandwidth by more than 50 % compared with uniformly illuminated SOI PD's or with GaAs TWPD's of same geometry and the bandwidth-efficiency product can be enhanced by achieving adequate reflection conditions for the optical signal at the ends of the SOI device...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{frequency}} combs (OFC) generated by electro-optic modulation of continuous-wave lasers provide broadband coherent sources with high power per line and independent control of line spacing {{and the number}} of lines. In addition to their application in spectroscopy, they offer flexible and optimized sources for the interrogation of other sensors based on wavelength change or wavelength filtering, such as fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. In this paper, a dual-OFC FBG interrogation system based on a single laser and two optical-phase modulators is presented. This architecture allows for the configuration of multimode optical source parameters such as the number of modes and their position within the reflected spectrum of the FBG. A direct read-out is obtained by mapping the optical spectrum onto the <b>radio-frequency</b> spectrum <b>output</b> of the dual-comb. This interrogation scheme is proposed for measuring fast phenomena such as vibrations and ultrasounds. Results are presented for dual-comb operation under optimized control. The optical modes are mapped onto detectable tones that are multiples of 0. 5 MHz around a center radiofrequency tone (40 MHz). Measurements of ultrasounds (40 kHz and 120 kHz) are demonstrated with this sensing system. Ultrasounds induce dynamic strain onto the fiber, which generates changes in the reflected Bragg wavelength and, hence, modulates the amplitude of the OFC modes within the reflected spectrum. The amplitude modulation of two counterphase tones is detected to obtain a differential measurement proportional to the ultrasound signal...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the thermal {{challenge of the}} Space Solar Power (SSP) design concepts with a 3. 5 GW <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>output.</b> High efficiency klystrons are thermally more favored than solid state (butterstick) to convert direct current (DC) electricity to radio-frequency (RF) energy at the transmitters in these concepts. Using klystrons, the heat dissipation is 0. 72 GW. Using solid state, the heat dissipation is 2. 33 GW. The heat dissipation of the klystrons is 85 % at 500 C, 10 % at 300 C, and 5 % at 125 C. All the heat dissipation of the solid state is at 100 C. Using klystrons, the radiator area is 74, 500 square m Using solid state, the radiator area is 2, 362, 200 square m Space constructable heat pipe radiators are assumed in the thermal analysis. Also, to make the SSP concepts feasible, {{the mass of the}} heat transport system must be minimized. The heat transport distance from the transmitters to the radiators must be minimized. It can be accomplished by dividing the radiator into a cluster of small radiators, so that the heat transport distances between the klystrons and radiators can be minimized. The area of each small radiator is on the order of 1 square m. Two concepts for accommodating a cluster of small radiators are presented. If the distance between the transmitters and radiators is 1. 5 m or less, constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs) are acceptable for heat transport. If the distance exceeds 1. 5 m, loop heat pipes (LHPs) are needed...|$|R
