40|$|Three {{methods for}} the {{formation}} of negative ions are reviewed : double charge-exchange, whereby low-energy positive ions are converted to negative ions by two sequential electron captures in a vapor target; electron-volume-processes wherein low-energy electrons lead to negative-ion formation by dissociative attachment or dissociative <b>recombination</b> <b>by</b> <b>collisions</b> with hydrogen molecules or hydrogen molecular ions and, surface processes leading to negative ions by backscattering or desorption induced by energetic particle bombardment. The application of these method to the development of hydrogen-negative-ion sources is discussed...|$|R
40|$|V(D) J {{recombination}} {{generates a}} remarkably diverse repertoire of antigen receptors through the rearrangement of germline DNA. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a polymerase that adds random nucleotides (N regions) to recombination junctions, {{is a key}} enzyme contributing to this diversity. The current model is that TdT adds N regions during V(D) J <b>recombination</b> <b>by</b> random <b>collision</b> with the DNA ends, without a dependence on other cellular factors. We previously demonstrated, however, that V(D) J junctions from Ku 80 -deficient mice unexpectedly lack N regions, although the mechanism responsible for this effect remains undefined in the mouse system. One possibility is that junctions are formed in these mice during a stage in development when TdT is not expressed. Alternatively, Ku 80 may be required for the expression, nuclear localization or enzymatic activity of TdT. Here we show that V(D) J junctions isolated from Ku 80 -deficient fibroblasts are devoid of N regions, as were junctions in Ku 80 -deficient mice. In these cells TdT protein is abundant {{at the time of}} recombination, localizes properly to the nucleus and is enzymatically active. Based on these data, we propose that TdT does not add to recombination junctions through random collision but is actively recruited to the V(D) J recombinase complex by Ku 80...|$|R
40|$|In Escherichia coli, {{chromosome}} dimers {{are resolved}} to monomers {{by the addition}} of a single cross-over at a specific locus on the chromosome, dif. <b>Recombination</b> is performed <b>by</b> two tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD, and requires the action of an additional protein, FtsK. We show that Haemophilus influenzae FtsK activates <b>recombination</b> <b>by</b> H. influenzae XerCD at H. influenzae dif. However, it cannot activate <b>recombination</b> <b>by</b> E. coli XerCD. Reciprocally, E. coli FtsK cannot activate <b>recombination</b> <b>by</b> the H. influenzae recombinases at H. influenzae dif. We took advantage of this species specificity to gain further insight into the mechanism of activation of Xer <b>recombination</b> at dif <b>by</b> FtsK. We mapped the region of FtsK implicated in species specificity to the extreme 140 -amino-acid C-terminal residues of the protein. Our results suggest that FtsK interacts directly with XerCD in order to activate recombination at dif...|$|R

Transient co-transfection assays using β-galactosidase as reporter for recombination reveal that episomal DNA {{does not contain}} a significant level of unconstrained negative supercoiling, since only mutant resolvases are recombination-proficient. We also show that the efficiency of <b>recombination</b> <b>by</b> the resolvase double mutant is comparable to that observed with Cre, which indicates that resolvase {{can be used as}} a new tool for controlled manipulations of episomal DNAs...|$|R
