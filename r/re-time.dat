40|$|State University (CSU), and Colorado Division of Water Resources (CDWR) {{are working}} {{together}} to monitor site hydrology and develop a groundwater model for the Tamarack Ranch Groundwater Recharge Project (Project). Located on CDOW’s Tamarack Ranch State Wildlife Area (Tamarack SWA), the Project <b>re-times</b> excess South Platte River flows through managed groundwater recharge. The Project is designed to pump groundwater wells next to the river {{when there is no}} call on the South Platte River, and deliver this water to recharge ponds. This recharge water becomes part of the alluvial groundwater system, and travels hack to the South Platte River providing accretion water at a later time to the South Platte River when additional river flows are needed. The facilities currently include 10 pumping wells located along the lower South Platte River and three recharge ponds located within the Sand Hills several thousand feet south of the river. Groundwater and surface water monitoring are providing critical data needed to assess changes in wetland and waterfowl habitat, and to track groundwater returns to the South Platte River. A numerical groundwater model has been developed to optimize Project operations and better defme the complex interactions of the site-specific hydrogeology, groundwater pumping, and surface recharge ponds.

50|$|Just as {{increasing}} road capacity reduces {{the cost of}} travel and thus increases demand, the reverse is also true - decreasing road capacity increases the cost of travel, so demand is reduced. This observation, {{for which there is}} much empirical evidence, has been called disappearing traffic, also traffic evaporation or traffic suppression, or, more generally, dissuaded demand. So the closure of a road or reduction in its capacity (e.g. reducing the number of available lanes) will result in the adjustment of traveler behavior to compensate - for example, people might stop making particular trips, condense multiple trips into one, <b>re-time</b> their trips to a less congested time, or switch to public transport, carpooling, walking, bicycling or smaller motor vehicles less affected by road diets, such as motorcycles, depending upon the values of those trips or of the schedule delay they experience.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{increase}} {{flows from}} Colorado to Nebraska during critical periods for a multi-state endangered species recovery effort, several new managed groundwater recharge facilities {{are being developed}} in the Lower South Platte Basin of Colorado. Managed groundwater recharge is a water management technique that cycles stream water through adjacent aquifers to <b>re-time</b> river flows. Many of the new managed recharge facilities will be developed at State Wildlife Areas, at which the Colorado Division of Wildlife mandates that any activities must provide benefits for wildlife. There is also interest in integrating habitat into private land recharge facilities so that landowners can participate {{in state and federal}} conservation partnership programs. Habitat benefits associated with recharge ponds have been observed by wildlife professionals, but scientific studies specifically on the creation and enhancement of habitat through recharge facility development and operation are not available. Pilot projects have been conducted to experiment with methods for incorporating habitat enhancements into recharge facility designs. Current research will develop a knowledge-based tool with which to assess potential recharge sites for habitat enhancement opportunities and streamflow augmentation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a longitudinal study of the travel behaviour change associated with the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games (the ‘Games’). The research examines commuter travel behaviour through a panel approach enabling an understanding of individual behaviour across three waves (before, during and after), with the study utilising unique access to a Transport for London panel study (n = 1132). The findings indicate that {{a substantial amount of}} change occurred during the Games (54 % made at least one change), with reducing or re-timing journeys being the most likely adaptations made. A key objective of this work was to advance the discussion about the theoretical constructs that are most applicable in the study of behaviour change associated with disruptive events, which was done through the application and critical evaluation of the Transtheoretical Model. The insights from the stages of change element of the model were relatively limited but the analysis shows significant differences in the underlying factors explaining change according to the type of change made (reduce, <b>re-time,</b> re-mode and re-route). Whilst the long-term behavioural impacts of events like the Games appear small, the study has uncovered a need to consider these behavioural choices as distinct rather than under the collective term of “travel behaviour change”, as is current practice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract__ We {{investigate}} to {{what degree}} we can integrate a Train Timetabling / Engine Scheduling Problem with a Crew Scheduling Problem. In the Timetabling Problem we design a timetable for the desired lines by fixing the departure and arrival times. Also, we allocate time-slots in the network to secure a feasible timetable. Next, we assign engines in the Engine Scheduling Problem to the lines {{in accordance with the}} timetable. The overall integration is achieved by obtaining an optimal solution for the Timetabling / Engine Scheduling Problem. We exploit the fact that numerous optimal, and near optimal solutions exists. We consider all solutions that can be obtained from the optimal engine schedule by altering the timetable, while keeping the order of demands in the schedules intact. The Crew Scheduling model is allowed to <b>re-time</b> the service of demands if the additional cost is outweighed by the crew savings. This information is implemented in a mathematical model for the Crew Scheduling Problem. The model is solved using a column generation scheme. Hereby it is possible for the Crew Scheduling algorithm to adjust the timetable and achieve a better overall solution. We perform computational experiments based on a case at a freight railway operator, DB Schenker Rail Scandinavia, and show that significant cost savings can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in cities is traffic, this paper proposed new solution to traffic control. The main design concept of this project is to control the traffic automatically. System is made more efficient with addition of intelligence in term of artificial vision, using image processing techniques to estimate actual road traffic and compute time, each time for every road before enabling the signal. This model is resemblance of traditional traffic police man who takes better decision every time and soothes traffic flow. Unpredicted growth of traffic today has created serious problem in metro cities. This project has been implemented in the Matlab software and it aims to prevent heavy traffic in highways. Moreover, for implementing this project following steps must be considered: 1) image acquisition 2) RGB to gray scale transformation 3) image cropping and 4) density estimation. At first, film of highway is captured by a camera which is installed at the square that is intersection of road. Then, the camera takes pictures at regular intervals and then the captured frame {{is sent to the}} computer for further processing. After that, the number of cars in square is specified. At the end, if the number of cars is more than a threshold, a message is shown to inform the traffic status. By this message we can predict the need {{to reduce the size of}} traffic carried. Experiments show that the algorithm will work properly and also we can <b>re-time</b> the traffic gree...|$|E
40|$|Statistics {{show that}} airline flight delays and {{cancellations}} have increased continuously {{over the period}} from 1995 to 2000. During the same period, customer dissatisfaction and complaints have followed a similar, even more dramatic trend. In 2001, {{as a consequence of}} the September 1 th terrorist attacks and the resulting airline schedule reductions, delay levels decreased, but only temporarily. With growing passenger demands and stagnant capacity passenger delays and disruptions are again on the rise. Approaches to mitigate schedule disruptions include: 1) re-optimizing the schedule during operations after a disruption occurs. For example, an airline operations controller might decide to cancel or postpone some flight legs or to re-route some aircraft to recover the rest of the schedule; and 2) building robustness into the schedule in the planning stage. By robustness we mean the ability to absorb flight delays so these effects are minimized on passengers and crews. In many cases, trying to reduce delays in the planning stage can be less costly for the airlines, especially if the actions suggested to modify the schedule are not expensive. Pushing back a flight's departure time only ten minutes might cost the airline little but can potentially reduce the number of passenger misconnections given the stochastic nature of airline operations. Canceling a flight during operations for example, can be however very costly. The primary goal of this research is to propose planning models to re-route aircraft and <b>re-time</b> flight departures, either separately or simultaneously, in order to distribute slack time in the network optimally and reduce passenger delays. Using data from a major U. S. airline we observe that with our model, we can reduce flight and passenger delay levels. by Sepehr Sarmadi. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringAndrew RysClock {{and data}} {{recovery}} (CDR) circuits form {{the backbone of}} high speed receivers. These receivers are used in various applications such as chip to chip interconnects, optical communications and backplane routing. The received data in CDR circuits are potentially noisy and asynchronous, i. e. they are not accompanied by a clock. The CDR circuit has to generate a clock from the data and then retime the data. The CDR circuit that recovers the clock and retimes the data has to remove the jitter that is accumulated during its transport through channels due to inter symbol interference (ISI). There are stringent jitter specifications defined by various communication standards {{that must be addressed}} by CDR circuits. These make the design of CDR circuits more difficult for system designers as well the circuit designer. Many parameters have to be taken into consideration while designing a CDR circuit. The problem becomes even more interesting as there are various tradeoffs in the design. As speeds of communications increase, the maximum allowable jitter decreases. Jitter in CDR circuits arises due to a lot of factors and is also dependent on the method used for clock and data recovery. In CDR circuits that use phase locked loops to recover the clock and retime the data, jitter may be caused by the metastability of sequential elements used in phase detectors. Jitter is also caused by the phase noise of the VCO used in the PLL. In CDR circuits that use the delay locked loop to recover the clock and data, jitter may be caused by the metastability of sequential elements in phase detectors as well as the quality of reference clock that is used to <b>re-time</b> the data. Additional effects that can cause jitter in CDR circuits include the use of spread spectrum clocking, delta sigma noise shaping performance, etc. In this thesis a non-sequential linear phase detector has been proposed which does not use any sequential elements to avoid metastability issues in phase detectors. The output jitter in a CDR circuit that uses the proposed phase detector is measured and compared to a Hogge Phase Detector [5]...|$|E
