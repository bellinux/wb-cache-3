40|$|Purpose: The European Network of Biological and <b>Physical</b> <b>Retrospective</b> <b>Dosimetry</b> ‘RENEB’ {{has contributed}} to European {{radiation}} emergency preparedness. To give homogeneous dose estimation results, RENEB partners must harmonize their processes. Materials and methods: A first inter-comparison focused on biological and <b>physical</b> <b>dosimetry</b> was used to detect the outliers in terms of dose estimation. Subsequently, trainings were organized to improve both tools dose estimation. A second inter-comparison was performed to validate training efficiency. Simultaneously, based on ISO standards, a QA&QM manual on all dosimetry assays was produced which states a common basis and harmonized procedures for each assay. The evaluation of the agreement of RENEB partners to follow the QA&QM manual was performed through a questionnaire. The integration of new members into the network {{was carried out in}} the same way, whatever the assays. Results: The training courses on biological and <b>physical</b> <b>dosimetry</b> were judged to be successful because most of the RENEB members’ dose estimates improved in the second inter-comparison. The QA&QM manual describes the consensus for the minimum requirements and the performance criteria for both dosimetry assays. The questionnaire revealed that the whole network capacity currently can manage between 15 and 3800 samples once. Conclusion: The methodology used to harmonize all dosimetry practice within the network RENEB was highly successful.

40|$|Purpose: A European {{network was}} {{initiated}} in 2012 by 23 partners from 16 European countries {{with the aim}} to significantly increase individualized dose reconstruction in case of large-scale radiological emergency scenarios. Results: The network was built on three complementary pillars: (1) an operational basis with seven biological and physical dosimetric assays in ready-to-use mode, (2) a basis for education, training and quality assurance, and (3) a basis for further network development regarding new techniques and members. Techniques for individual dose estimation based on biological samples and/or inert personalized devices as mobile phones or smart phones were optimized to support rapid categorization of many potential victims according to the received dose to the blood or personal devices. Communication and cross-border collaboration were also standardized. To assure long-term sustainability of the network, cooperation with national and international emergency preparedness organizations was initiated and links to radiation protection and research platforms have been developed. A legal framework, based on a Memorandum of Understanding, was established and signed by 27 organizations {{by the end of}} 2015. Conclusions: RENEB is a European Network of biological and <b>physical</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>dosimetry,</b> with the capacity and capability to perform large-scale rapid individualized dose estimation. Specialized to handle large numbers of samples, RENEB is able to contribute to radiological emergency preparedness and wider large-scale research projects...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to perform {{cytogenetic}} analysis by means of a semi-automated micronucleus-centromere assay in lymphocytes from medical radiation workers. Two groups of workers receiving the highest occupational doses were selected: 10 nuclear medicine technicians and 10 interventional radiologists/cardiologists. Centromere-negative micronucleus (MNCM-) data, obtained from these two groups of medical radiation workers were compared with those obtained in matched controls. The blood samples of the matched controls were additionally used to construct a 'low-dose' (0 - 100 mGy) MNCM-dose-response curve to evaluate the sensitivity and suitability of the micronucleus-centromere assay as an 'effect' biomarker in medical surveillance programs. The <b>physical</b> <b>dosimetry</b> data of the 3 years preceding the blood sampling, based on single or double dosimetry practices, were collected for the interpretation of the micronucleus data. The in vitro radiation results showed that for small sized groups, semi-automated scoring of MNCM-enables the detection of a dose of 50 mGy. The comparison of MNCM-yields in medical radiation workers and control individuals showed enhanced MNCM-scores in the medical radiation workers group (P= 0. 15). The highest MNCM-scores were obtained in the interventional radiologists/cardiologists group, and these scores were significantly higher compared with those obtained from the matched control group (P= 0. 05). The higher MNCM-scores observed in interventional radiologists/cardiologists compared with nuclear medicine technicians were not in agreement with the personal dosimetry records in both groups, which may point to the limitation of 'double dosimetry' procedures used in interventional radiology/cardiology.

The long-range goals of the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) Biological Dosimetry Team are to develop validated radiation biodosimeters and to equip medical personnel with diagnostic information (clinical signs and symptoms, <b>physical</b> <b>dosimetry,</b> etc.) germane to the medical management of human radiation casualties.

We aimed to explore the extent of chromosomal damage in circulating lymphocytes of hospital workers (technicians, nurses and physicians) chronically exposed to a very low level of radiation using conventional and molecular cytogenetic analyses (chromosome painting with chromosomes # 2, # 3 and # 10 as probe cocktail). Compared with controls, exposed workers displayed {{a significant increase in the}} frequency of aberrant lymphocytes (1. 26 +/- 0. 11 / 100 cells versus 1. 63 +/- 0. 17 / 100 cells).

Interestingly, we found that the chromosomal damage was prevalently expressed as chromatid-type aberrations. Chromosome painting indicated that the frequency of chromosome rearrangements (CR; translocations and dicentrics pooled together) was approximately comparable between radiological workers and the control group.

In this study an attempt has been made to verify the <b>physical</b> <b>dosimetry</b> in actual human body scenario by using goat head as "head phantom" and goat meat as "tissue phantom". The mean percentage variation between planned and measured doses was found to be 2. 48 (standard deviation (SD) : 0. 74), 2. 36 (SD: 0. 77), 3. 62 (SD: 1. 05), and 3. 31 (SD: 0. 78) for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 DCRT) (head phantom), intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT; head phantom), 3 DCRT (tissue phantom), and IMRT (tissue phantom), respectively. Although percentage variations in case of head phantom were within tolerance limit (< ± 3 %), but still it is higher than the results obtained by using commercially available phantoms.

40|$|Cytogenetic {{analysis}} was performed in peripheral blood lymphocytes from hospital workers chronically exposed to ionizing radiation in comparison to matched non-exposed individuals. The accumulated absorbed doses calculated for the radiation workers ranged from 9. 5 to 209. 4 mSv. The endpoints used were chromosomal aber-rations (CA), micronuclei (MN), and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE). The fre-quencies of CA/ 100 cells observed for the exposed group were significantly (P= 0. 018) {{higher than in the}} control group: 3. 2 and 2. 6, respectively. Similarly, the mean num-bers of SCE per cell were statistically higher (P= 0. 025) in the exposed group (6. 2) in comparison with the control group (5. 8). In the case of micronuclei analysis, no significant (P= 0, 06) difference between both groups was found, but these data should be cautiously interpreted since an increase in the frequencies of MN was found for radiation workers (3. 0 MN/ 100 cells), compared to the control group (2. 6 MN/ 100 cells) and this increase occur in parallel to CA and SCE frequencies. The difference between the results could be explained by the nature of CA and MN generation.

40|$|Imaging {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} techniques to quantify radiation dose. While films and active fluorescent detectors are still commonly used in <b>physical</b> <b>dosimetry,</b> biological imaging is emerging as a new method to visualize and quantify radiation dose in biological targets. Methods for biological imaging are normally based on molecular fluorescent probes, labeling chromatin-conjugated molecules or specific repair proteins. Examples are chromatin-binding coumarin compounds, which become fluorescent under irradiation, or the H 2 AX histone, which is rapidly phosphorylated at sites of DNA double-strand breaks and can be visualized by immunostaining. Many other DNA repair proteins can be expressed with fluorescent targets, such as green fluorescent protein, thus becoming visible for dose estimation in vivo. The possibility to visualize radiation damage in living biological targets is particularly important for repair kinetic studies, for estimating individual radiation response, and for remote control of living samples exposed to radiation, for instance in robotic space missions. In vivo dose monitoring in particle therapy exploits the production of positron emitters by nuclear interaction of the incident beam in the patient's body. Positron emission tomography (PET) can then be used to visualize and quantify the particle dose in the patient, and it can in principle also be used for radiotherapy with high-energy X rays.

The nature of the Chernobyl accident, where large amounts of radioactive nuclides spread in the reactor area and all over Europe, dictated the emphasis of the presented papers covering both direct radiation effects and effects of radioactive contaminants on large populations. In addition to classical radiobiologic studies {{of the effects of}} radiation on cells, organs, humans and their environment, basic studies of DNA damage and repair, the possibility to enhance and repair, and studies of radioprotectors, emphasis was directed at the effects of radiation on large populations and at the inaccuracy of dosimetry.

For the assessment of health risks, <b>physical</b> <b>dosimetry</b> has been indispensable. However, the change of the location of dosimeters on the crew members, the variation in dose rate with location inside the spacecraft and the unknown biological effects of microgravity can introduce significant uncertainties in estimating exposure. To circumvent such uncertainty, a study on the cytogenetic effects of space radiation in human lymphocytes was proposed and conducted for Mir- 18, a 115 -day mission. This study used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole-chromosome painting probes to score chromosomal exchanges and the Giemsa staining method to determine the frequency of dicentrics. The growth kinetics of cells and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) were examined to ensure that chromosomal aberrations were scored in the first mitosis and were induced primarily by space radiation. Our results showed that the frequency of chromosomal aberrations increased significantly in postflight samples compared to samples drawn prior to flight, and that the frequency of SCEs was similar for both pre- and postflight samples. Based on a dose-response curve for preflight samples exposed to gamma rays, the absorbed dose received by crew members during the mission was estimated to be about 14. 75 cSv.

The size and the number of residual nuclear γ-H 2 AX foci increased as a function of linear energy transfer (LET) and RBE, reminiscent of enhanced DNA-damage complexity and accumulation of non-repairable DSB.

It is known that the probability of carcinogenesis is greater in populations exposed to radiation, since ionizing radiation can raise the frequency of chromosomal aberration and spontaneous mutations. ObjectiveOur purpose was to assess the role of chromosomal aberrations and oxidative DNA adduct 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) as biomarkers of radiation injury in individuals occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. Subjectsand Methods: Blood samples were collected from 60 radiation workers and 30 healthy volunteers age and sex matched as control group who had never worked in radiation-related jobs. Chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes were assayed by conventional cytogenetic technique and serum levels of 8 -OHdG was measured by enzyme linked immunossorbent assay (ELISA). ResultsThe incidence of all types of chromosomal aberrations was significantly higher in all exposed groups than in controls with the highest rate of chromosomal aberrations in the industrial radiographers. Serum 8 -OHdG in all radiation workers was significantly higher than in control group. There was a significant higher values among industrial radiographers compared to diagnostic radiologists or radiotherapists. Significantly lower mean corpuscular volume (M. C.

For all individuals, the frequency of chromosome damage measured within a month of return from space was higher than their prefight yield and biodosimetry estimates lie within the range expected from <b>physical</b> <b>dosimetry.</b> Biodosimetry data provides a direct measurement of space radiation damage, which takes into account individual radiosensitivity {{in the presence of}} confounding factors such as microgravity and other stress conditions. In contrast to physical measurements, which are external to body and require multiple devices to detect all radiation types all of which have poor sensitivity to neutrons, biodosimetry is internal and includes the effects of shielding provided by the body itself plus chromosome damage shows excellent sensitivity to protons, heavy ions, and neutrons. In addition, chromosome damage is reflective of cancer risk and biodosimetry values can therefore be used to validate and develop risk assessment models {{that can be used to}} characterize excess health risk incurred by crewmembers. A review of astronaut biodosimetry data will be presented along with recent findings on the persistence of space radiation induced chromosome damage and the cytogenetic effects of repeat long duration mission...|$|R

Genotoxic environmental agents such as IR trigger a cascade of signal transduction pathways for cellular protection. In this study, using cDNA microarray technique, we monitored the gene expression profiles in lymphocytes derived from radiation-ex posed individuals (radiation workers). <b>Physical</b> <b>dosimetry</b> records on these patients indicated that the absorbed dose ranged from 0. 696 to 39. 088 mSv. Gene expression analysis revealed statistically significant transcriptional changes in a total of 78 genes (21 up-regulated and 57 clown-regulated) involved in several biological processes such as ubiquitin cycle (UHRF 2 and PIAS 1), DNA repair (LIG 3, XPA, ERCC 5, RAD 52, DCLRE 1 C), cell cycle regulation/proliferation (RHOA, CABLES 2, TGFB 2, IL 16), and stress response (GSTP 1, PPP 2 R 5 A, DUSP 22). Some of the genes that showed altered expression profiles in this study call be used as biomarkers for monitoring the chronic low level exposure in humans. Additionally, alterations in gene expression patterns observed in chronically exposed radiation workers reinforces the need for defining the effective radiation dose that causes immediate genetic damage as well as the long-term effects on genomic instability, including cancer.

40|$|Objective: Brachytherapy {{employing}} iodine- 125 seeds is {{an established}} treatment for low-risk prostate cancers. Post-implant dosimetry (PID) {{is an important}} tool for identifying suboptimal implants. The aim of this work was to improve suboptimal implants by a subsequent iodine- 125 seed top-up (reimplantation), based on the PID results. Methods: Of 255 patients treated between 2009 and 2012, 6 were identified as having received suboptimal implants and were scheduled for seed top-up. Needle configurations {{and the number of}} top-up seeds were determined based on post-implant CT images as well as a reimplantation treatment plan. An average of 14 seeds per patient were implanted during each top-up. Dosimetric outcome was assessed via target parameters and doses received by organs at risk. Results: All six patients had a successful top-up, with a 67 % increase in the mean dose delivered to 90 % of the prostate volume and a 40 % increase in the volume that receives 100 % of the prescribed dose. However, the final dosimetric assessment was based on the same seed activity, as the planning system does not account for the decay of the initially implanted seeds. Although <b>physical</b> <b>dosimetry</b> is not influenced by different seed activities (doses are calculated to infinity), the radiobiological implications might be slightly different from the situation when optimal implantation is achieved with one treatment only. Conclusion: Seed reimplantation in suboptimal prostate implants is feasible and leads to successful clinical outcomes. Advances in knowledge: Suboptimal prostate implants can occur for various reasons. This work shows that seed reimplantation as salvage therapy can lead to an optimal dosimetric outcome with manageable normal tissue effects. L G Marcu and J M Lawso...|$|R
40|$|Background: There are evidences of {{association}} between occupational radiation exposure, cytogenetic alterations {{and the increase}} in cancer rates. It is known that the probability of carcinogenesis is greater in populations exposed to radiation, since ionizing radiation can raise the frequency of chromosomal aberration and spontaneous mutations. Objective: Our purpose was to assess the role of chromosomal aberrations and oxidative DNA adduct 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) as biomarkers of radiation injury in individuals occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. Subjects: and Methods: Blood samples were collected from 60 radiation workers and 30 healthy volunteers age and sex matched as control group who had never worked in radiation-related jobs. Chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes were assayed by conventional cytogenetic technique and serum levels of 8 -OHdG was measured by enzyme linked immunossorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The incidence of all types of chromosomal aberrations was significantly higher in all exposed groups than in controls with the highest rate of chromosomal aberrations in the industrial radiographers. Serum 8 -OHdG in all radiation workers was significantly higher than in control group. There was a significant higher values among industrial radiographers compared to diagnostic radiologists or radiotherapists. Significantly lower mean corpuscular volume (M. C. V) was found among radiation workers versus the controls reflecting erythrocyte microcytosis. Conclusions: Scoring of chromosome aberrations such as breaks, fragments and dicentrics is a reliable method to detect previous exposure to ionizing radiation. This type of monitoring may be used as a biological dosimeter instead of <b>physical</b> <b>dosimetry.</b> 8 -OHdG is a useful oxidative DNA marker among radiation workers and those exposed to environmental carcinogens...|$|R
