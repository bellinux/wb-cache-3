5|$|A solar cell, or {{photovoltaic}} cell (PV), is {{a device that}} converts light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. The German industrialist Ernst Werner von Siemens {{was among those who}} <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of this discovery. In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide, although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.|$|E
5|$|General Buford <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of {{the high}} ground {{directly}} {{to the south of}} Gettysburg. He knew that if the Confederates could gain control of the heights, Meade's army {{would have a hard time}} dislodging them. He decided to utilize three ridges west of Gettysburg: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge, and Seminary Ridge (proceeding west to east toward the town). These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town, Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Early that morning, Reynolds, who was commanding the Left Wing of the Army of the Potomac, ordered his corps to march to Buford's location, with the XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) to follow closely behind.|$|E

5|$|Quintilian {{provides}} the most extensive theory of primary education in Latin literature. According to Quintilian, each child has in-born ingenium, a talent for learning or linguistic intelligence that {{is ready to be}} cultivated and sharpened, as evidenced by the young child's ability to memorize and imitate. The child incapable of learning was rare. To Quintilian, ingenium represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling. He also <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of play in child development, and disapproved of corporal punishment because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking children with a cane (ferula) or birch rod for being slow or disruptive.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{increasingly}} <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of figures other than John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli {{in the early}} formation of the Reformed tradition. Richard Muller, a chief authority {{on the development of}} this movement, has argued that Vermigli, Wolfgang Musculus, and Heinrich Bullinger were as influential if not more influential than Calvin on the development of Reformed theology in the sixteenth century. Vermigli was a transitional figure between the Reformation period and the period known as Reformed orthodoxy. In the Reformed orthodox period, the theology first articulated by Reformation figures was codified and systematized. Theologians increasingly resorted to the methods of scholastic theology and the tradition of Aristotelianism. Vermigli {{was the first of the}} Reformed scholastic theologians, and he influenced later scholastics Theodore Beza and Girolamo Zanchi.|$|E
5|$|The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of {{the site}} by recommending its {{designation}} {{as one of the}} National Historic Sites of Canada; it was so designated in 1996, and is one of only two outside of Canada. The other is the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial, also in France. Remembrance has also taken other forms: the Vimy Foundation, having been established to preserve and promote Canada's First World War legacy as symbolized by the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, and Vimy Ridge Day, to commemorate the deaths and casualties during the battle. Local Vimy resident Georges Devloo spent 13 years until his death in 2009 offering car rides to Canadian tourists to and from the memorial at no charge, as a way of paying tribute to the Canadians who fought at Vimy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{photovoltaics}} (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide.

These early solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%. By 2012 available efficiencies exceeded 20%, and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40%.|$|E
