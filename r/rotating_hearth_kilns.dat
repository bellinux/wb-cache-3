40|$|Abstract—Remote {{engineering}} (also {{known as}} online engineering) {{may be defined}} as a combination of control engineering and telematics. In this area, specific activities require computacional skills in order to develop projects where electrical devives are monitored and / or controlled, in an intercative way, through a distributed network (e. g. Intranet or Internet). In our specific case, we will be dealing with an industrial plant. Within the last few years, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of activities related to remote engineering, which may be connected to the phenomenon of the large extension experienced by the Internet (e. g. bandwith, number of users, development tools, etc.). This increase opens new and future possibilities to the implementation of advance teleworking (or e-working) positions. In this paper we present the architecture for a remote application, accessible through the Internet, able to monitor and control a roller <b>hearth</b> <b>kiln,</b> used in a ceramics industry for firing materials. The proposed architecture is based on a micro web server, whose main function is to monitor and control the firing process, by reading the data from a series of temperature sensors and by controlling a series of electronic valves and servo motors. This solution is also intended to be a low-cost alternative to other potential solutions. The temperature readings are obtained through K-type thermopairs and the gas flow is controlled through electrovalves. As the firing process should not be stopped before its complete end, the system is equipped with a safety device for that specific purpose. For better understanding the system to be automated and its operation we decided to develop a scale model (100 : 1) and experiment on it the devised solution, based on a Micro Web Server.

40|$|International audienceThe {{errors that}} occur at {{different}} stages of the archaeomagnetic calibration process are combined using a Bayesian hierarchical modelling. The archaeomagnetic data obtained from archaeological structures such as <b>hearths,</b> <b>kilns</b> or sets of bricks and tiles, exhibit considerable experimental errors and are generally more or less well dated by archaeological context, history or chronometric methods (14 C, TL, dendrochronology, etc.). They can also be associated with stratigraphic observations which provide prior relative chronological information. The modelling we propose allows all these observations and errors to be linked together thanks to appropriate prior probability densities. The model also includes penalized cubic splines for estimating the univariate, spherical or three-dimensional curves for the secular variation of the geomagnetic field (inclination, declination, intensity) over time at a local place. The mean smooth curve we obtain, with its posterior Bayesian envelop provides an adaptation to the effects of variability in the density of reference points over time. Moreover, the hierarchical modelling also allows an efficient way to penalize outliers automatically. With this new posterior estimate of the curve, the Bayesian statistical framework then allows to estimate the calendar dates of undated archaeological features (such as kilns) based on one, two or three geomagnetic parameters (inclination, declination and/or intensity). Date estimates are presented {{in the same way as}} those that arise from radiocarbon dating. In order to illustrate the model and the inference method used, we will present results based on French, Bulgarian and Austrian datasets recently published...|$|R

The operation {{took place in the}} site where the ruins of the ancient ci y of Europos are buried. This site is in northern Greece. Resistivity prospecting was employed to detect the remnants ofwall foundations inthe place where the main urban complex of the ancient city once stood. The data were transformed in an image form depicting, thus, the spatial variation of resistivity in a manner that resembles the plane view of the ruins that could have been drawn if an excavation had taken place. This image revealed the urban plan of the latest imes {{of the life of the}} city. Trial excavations verified the geophysical result. Magnetic prospecting in the same area complemented he resistivity data. Theexact location of the fire <b>hearths,</b> <b>kilns</b> and remnants of collapsed roofs were spotted. Magnetic gradient measurements were taken in an area out of the main complex of the ancient city and revealed the location of several kilns. One of these locations was excavated and a pottery kiln was discovered. The resistivity prospecting in one of the graveyards of the ancient city showed anomalies which were expected an corresponded to monumental tombs.

The archaeomagnetic data obtained from archaeological structures such as <b>hearths,</b> <b>kilns</b> or sets of bricks and tiles, exhibit considerable experimental errors and are typically more or less well dated by archaeological context, history or chronometric methods (14 C, TL, dendrochronology, etc.).

The modelling we describe in this paper allows all these observations, on materials from a given period, to be linked together, and the use of penalized maximum likelihood for smoothing univariate, spherical or three-dimensional time series data allows representation of the secular variation of the geomagnetic field over time. The smooth curve we obtain (which {{takes the form of a}} penalized natural cubic spline) provides an adaptation to the effects of variability in the density of reference points over time. Since our model takes account of all the known errors in the archaeomagnetic calibration process, we are able to obtain a functional highest-posterior-density envelope on the new curve. With this new posterior estimate of the curve available to us, the Bayesian statistical framework then allows us to estimate the calendar dates of undated archaeological features (such as kilns) based on one, two or three geomagnetic parameters (inclination, declination and/or intensity).

40|$|HF (hydrogen fluoride) {{emission}} control {{is one of}} the critical environmental parameters in the firing of ceramic materials at peak temperatures higher than 1000 °C. In this study, in-stack concentrations of HF were monitored on-line with laser-based equipment during the fast firing of ceramic tiles in continuous industrial roller <b>hearth</b> <b>kilns</b> under standard kiln operating conditions. Three different ceramic tile compositions: porous red-body wall tiles, red-body stoneware tiles, and porcelain tiles were fired in industrial kilns customarily used to manufacture these types of tiles, modifying the heating rate and tile dry bulk density. The in-stack concentrations of HF can be explained on the basis of tile HF adsorption and emission processes in the kiln preheating and firing zones, analysed in previous studies. The methodology used in this study has significant advantages for industrial studies compared with previous methodologies based primarily on laboratory-scale studies and analysis of solid material. The main advantages are: (a) rapid response, allowing abrupt changes in the HF emission to be studied; and (b) direct measurement of the in-stack concentration of HF, which is the most common parameter used as a legal limit for industrial {{emission control}}. The study shows that tile HF adsorption in the preheating zone is very important. It also shows that HF stack emissions can vary significantly in continuous kilns depending on whether glazed or unglazed tiles are produced, or important changes occur in production (such as gaps in the kiln feed). The results indicate, furthermore, that HF stack emissions do not decrease significantly when realistic changes are made in industrial operating conditions if these industrial kilns are run at peak temperatures above 1100 °C. The most important reduction in in-stack concentrations of HF is observed when glazed ceramic tiles are fired, so further research in this field can be made in order to reduce HF emissions. © 2009 Elsevier B.

5000|$|A {{multiple}} {{hearth furnace}} {{also known as a}} vertical calciner, is used for continuous preparation and calcining of materials. The {{multiple hearth furnace}} consists of several circular <b>hearths</b> or <b>kilns</b> superimposed on each other. Material is fed from the top and is moved by action of rotating [...] "rabble arms", and the revolving mechanical rabbles attached to the arms move over the surface of each hearth to continuously shift the ore. The arms are attached to a rotating central shaft that passes {{through the center of the}} roaster. As the material is moved, the ore that is charged at the top hearth gradually moves downward as it passes through windows in the floor of each hearth or through alternate passages around the shaft and the periphery until it finally emerges at the bottom. The oxidizing gases flow upward, i.e. , counter current to the descending charge. In a well - insulated roaster, external heating is unnecessary except when the charge is highly moist. The hearth at the top of the roaster dries and heats the charge. [...] and oxidation of the charge occur lower down.|$|R
50|$|Iron-titanium oxide {{minerals}} in basalt {{and other}} igneous rocks may preserve {{the direction of}} the Earth's magnetic field when the rocks cool through the Curie temperatures of those minerals. The Curie temperature of magnetite, a spinel-group iron oxide, is about 580°C, whereas most basalt and gabbro are completely crystallized at temperatures below 900°C. Hence, the mineral grains are not rotated physically to align with the Earth's field, but rather they may record the orientation of that field. The record so preserved is called a thermoremanent magnetization (TRM). Because complex oxidation reactions may occur as igneous rocks cool after crystallization, the orientations of the Earth's magnetic field are not always accurately recorded, nor is the record necessarily maintained. Nonetheless, the record has been preserved well enough in basalts of the ocean crust to have been critical in the development of theories of sea floor spreading related to plate tectonics. TRM can also be recorded in pottery <b>kilns,</b> <b>hearths,</b> and burned adobe buildings. The discipline based on the study of thermoremanent magnetisation in archaeological materials is called archaeomagnetic dating.|$|R

A 17 m by 40 m rectangular grid was established on the third terrace of the 850 year old mound surface. Readings were taken on the rectangular grid at one meter spacing. A Geometrics G- 856 proton precession magnetometer and a Geonics EM 38 conductivity meter {{were used for the}} survey. The survey was designed and executed to detect anomalous features within the very shallow subsurface (one to two meters deep). It was hoped to delineate and categorize the sources of the anomalies. The causes are known to be natural (in this case limited to lightning strikes), prehistoric (pottery, <b>kilns,</b> <b>hearths),</b> historic (metal, fire pits, structure remnants), or modern (metal). The larger, better-defined anomalies were numbered and discussed. Magnetic anomaly interpretations include a root cellar (4), outhouse (10), house (6), and metal features (7, 8, 14, 15). The certainty of the interpretations varied and there was often multiple interpretations possible. The EM anomaly interpretations proposed include metal, pit, grave, and animal burrowing. Good correlation is observed between some of the anomalies for the magnetic and electromagnetic methods, while other anomalies were observed using only one method.

Various combinations of metal-oxide feeds were processed {{in order to determine}} their effect on plasma torch operation, throughput, plant performance, glass chemistry and density of poured wastes. Testing took place in November of 1999 using a full-scale production Plasma Arc Centrifugal Treatment (PACT) system located at Retech where the melt zone is a <b>rotating</b> cylindrica l <b>hearth</b> (centrifuge) and the heating source is a swirl flow, hollow electrode, plasma arc torch. The simulated LLW included concrete cinder block, refractory insulation board, soda-lime glass, and sand. This study has shown that processing these simulated LLW and forming slags of various compositions is difficult if the instantaneous feed composition is very high in silica. The electrical resistance of pure silica is high, especially at low temperatures, increasing plasma torch operating voltage markedly. Because the sand can spread rapidly over the centrifuge bottom, feed rates must be reduced when nearly pure sand is fed to reduce the thickness of the unmelted, unmixed surface centrifuge contents. The difficulties may occur either because a whole drum of sand is fed, or because of segregation of sand while a previously mixed drum is fed through our Archimedes type feeder...|$|R
40|$|A near-surface {{geophysical}} {{survey was conducted}} at SunWatch Indian Village in Dayton, Ohio. The main motivations for this investigation were to evaluate geophysical methods to locate, map, and identify features associated with the SunWatch Indian Village archaeological site and to expand the area surveyed. Previous studies (Houston, 2002; Miller, 2004) have determined that burials covered with limestone slabs are relatively easy to detect and map geophysically with GPR and electrical resistivity. This was reconfirmed in this study by collecting 3 D GPR data over a 2 ̆ 7 control 2 ̆ 7 location previously surveyed by Houston (2002) and Miller (2004). However, similar anomalies were not observed in the other areas surveyed in this study suggesting that they are absent there. The GPR data were collected at 6 inch line spacing for 3 D surveys. A comparison of 3 D GPR analysis of 6 inch line spacing and 12 inch line spacing (by removing alternate lines) indicates that a 6 inch line spacing was better at defining the subtleties of limestone slabs but that the 12 inch line spacing was adequate for mapping the slab-covered burial site. Electromagnetic (EM) surveys were also conducted across the control {{as well as new}} areas but the EM did not show an anomaly at the known limestone slab-covered burial in the control area. This suggests that EM is not able to detect small, thin, resistive bodies (limestone slabs) in these conductive soils. On the other hand electrical resistivity is useful in detecting limestone slabs (Houston, 2002; Miller, 2004) but may be unable to detect more subtle conductivity contrasts likely associated with storage/ trash pits. The magnetic gradiometer surveys were successful in identifying local magnetic anomalies that correlated with an EM inphase anomaly. An interesting find was that the EM unit was able to detect in several unexcavated areas anomalies of high conductivity and low magnetic susceptibly that are believed to be associated with clusters of storage/trash pits. Another interesting find was that the EM instrument was able to detect the presence of an area of high magnetic susceptibility and low conductivity possibly indicating the location of a fire <b>hearth</b> or pottery <b>kiln.</b> Based on the results of this survey there are no new limestone slab covered burials located at SunWatch Indian Village in the areas surveyed but there is a possibility of clusters of storage/trash pits based on the EM signature. Before this study was conducted there was no definitive geophysical method of locating storage/trash pit at SunWatch Indian Village, however, this study suggests there may be a way to locate clusters of storage/trash pits using electromagnetics...|$|R
