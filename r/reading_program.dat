The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, has directed all units to maintain libraries within their respective headquarters for the continuing education of personnel in the art of war. The Art of War is mentioned as an example of works to be maintained at each facility, and staff duty officers are obliged to prepare short papers for presentation to other officers on their readings. Similarly, Sun Tzu's Art of War is listed on the Marine Corps Professional <b>Reading</b> <b>Program.</b> During the Gulf War in the 1990s, both Generals Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Colin Powell employed principles from Sun Tzu related to deception, speed, and striking one's enemy's weak points. However, the United States and other Western countries have been criticised for not truly understanding Sun Tzu's work and not appreciating The Art of War within the wider context of Chinese society.|$|E

When comparing programs individually to determine the success of each program, the first conclusion {{of this study was}} that guided <b>reading</b> <b>programs</b> were more effective in helping participating students develop comprehension. An additional conclusion was that once teachers use guided reading then it is also beneficial to use both programs together because the independent reading builds on the guided reading. Teachers need to use guided reading to teach strategies for gaining comprehension and then allow students to use independent <b>reading</b> <b>programs</b> to implement those strategies on their own. The limitations to this study include the small number of students participating in the study, the use of only quantitative data, and some differences in the availability of materials between the two programs This study raises questions for further research into on effective strategies in teaching reading comprehension that do not correspond to a <b>program.</b> KEYWORDS: Guided <b>reading</b> <b>programs,</b> Independent <b>reading</b> <b>programs,</b> Reading comprehension, Specialized Academic Instruction (SAl) ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{discover}} the status and characteristics of <b>reading</b> <b>programs</b> in the public secondary schools of Oregon. Procedures Questionnaires were mailed to all of Oregon's 327 schools, 106 junior high schools and 221 senior high schools. Responses were received from 84. 7 percent of the schools, 94. 3 percent of the junior high schools and 79. 6 percent of the senior high schools. The questionnaires consisted of two sections, one for schools without organized <b>reading</b> <b>programs</b> and one for schools with organized <b>reading</b> <b>programs.</b> The data were divided into eight different categories: (1) total public secondary schools, (2) total junior high schools, (3) large junior high schools, (4) small junior high schools, (5) total senior high schools, (6) large senior high schools, (7) medium senior high schools, and (8) small senior high schools. Randomly selected visitations were made to five junior high schools and to ten senior high schools to compare the working program with the described program. Respondents in 73. 6 percent of the junior high schools and in 39. 4 percent of the senior high schools indicated that their schools had organized <b>reading</b> <b>programs.</b> This is a total of 50. 5 percent of Oregon's public secondary schools. Summary Respondents in 89. 0 percent of the schools without <b>reading</b> <b>programs</b> indicated that a need for <b>reading</b> <b>programs</b> existed. Plans were being made to introduce <b>reading</b> <b>programs</b> in 59. 1 percent of these schools. About 72. 9 percent of the <b>reading</b> <b>programs</b> were less than six years old and a majority had been partially supported by Federal funds. Reading instruction in basic reading skills was generally provided in full credit classes which met five days each week. The prevailing method of:selecting students for the classes was by teacher and counselor recommendation along with their standardized test scores. In about 40 percent of the schools, 25 percent of the students had been identified as reading below grade level. In about 20 percent of the schools, 25 percent of the students were receiving special reading instruction Approximately 85 percent of the reading teachers have had at least one course in reading. About one-third of the schools had a written course of study. Tape recorders were used in 85. 2 percent of the schools; controlled readers in 82. 7 percent; record players in 68. 5 percent; tachistoscopic devices in 67. 3 percent; and pacers in 63. 0 percent of the schools. Conclusions The status of <b>reading</b> <b>programs</b> in the state of Oregon is one of rapid growth. The greatest need for <b>reading</b> <b>programs</b> is in the small senior high schools. There is a great need for well prepared reading teachers. Oregon secondary students are being discriminated against because of the shortage of adequately prepared teachers of reading and the inability of the subject matter teachers to teach those reading skills necessary for understanding in their content areas. The total evaluative program is inadequate and inaccurate. Very little reading instruction is being given in the content areas by classroom teachers. The emphasis is upon remediation and correction rather than continuous development of reading skills. In general, schools with <b>reading</b> <b>programs</b> have enthusiastic personnel who believe the programs are successful...|$|R

500|$|The {{kindergarten}} <b>reading</b> <b>program</b> was {{the first}} step in the Avery Coonley School's transition to a new focus on the education of the gifted, which coincided with a growing public awareness of the needs of gifted children in the late 1960s. The increasing focus on gifted education was symbolized by the 1972 Marland Report to the United States Congress, which {{was the first}} acknowledgment of the characteristics of gifted children and their specific educational needs. The report found that [...] "gifted children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs". The report highlighted the necessity for educational services for the gifted, and the near total lack of such programs in the public schools at the time. Malach believed that the educational philosophy of Avery Coonley was well aligned with the most important objectives of a gifted program, namely, [...] "the stimulation of individual interests... the development of student initiative, the development of self-acceptance, concept development, and recognition of the early ability to undertake complex learning tasks." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1965, the {{benefits}} of the National College of Education partnership were less evident and the Administrative Board purchased Avery Coonley from the NCE. Under Malach's leadership, ACS continued to experiment and innovate. Despite widespread skepticism among contemporary educators that kindergartners were ready to read, ACS launched an early <b>reading</b> <b>program</b> in the early 1960s. Malach's stance was that [...] "we don't believe a child should be taught because he or she is now 6 years old or in 1st grade. Our children begin to learn to read when the teacher determines the child is ready. Then the teacher works individually with the child at his or her own pace." [...] By this time, however, the once-radical ideas of progressive education had become [...] "conventional wisdom" [...] and kindergarten was a ubiquitous feature of American public schools. As part of Malach's [...] "bid to reforge the leadership role that Avery Coonley School had played during its early years", ACS joined the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS) in 1961. ISACS was founded in 1908 to promote best practices in independent schools, and instituted a mandatory accreditation program for member schools in 1961. Avery Coonley served as the headquarters of ISACS from 1970 until the central office was dissolved in 2000.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, {{the main}} {{gymnasium}} (referred to as [...] "The Garden") was completed. The football stadium {{was constructed in}} 1962 {{which was one of}} the largest stadiums in western Kansas at the time. Two years later, Garden City finally experienced unification as Garden City District No. 1 became Unified School District No. 457. During this same year, the football stadium was renamed [...] "Memorial Stadium". As interest in athletics grew throughout Garden City, so did the athletic departments. Cross-country was introduced in 1966 and the men's basketball team won their first state championship. Eight trailers were also purchased for use in the remedial <b>reading</b> <b>program.</b> Two years later, GCHS experienced major renovations and expansion as the J.D. Adams Vocational Building was constructed and other high school remodeling was completed. The population of Garden City at this time was 14,745. The following year, an agreement was signed between the JUCO and the district relative to the exchange of the former junior college site for senior high vocational building space and other specified district facilities used by the college. The wrestling and debate teams each won their first state titles in 1971. Restrooms facilities were also constructed during this year. The men's basketball team advanced to the state championship the following year. In 1974, math requirements for graduation increased to 1½ credits which became effective with the 1978 graduating class. An addition to the music department was completed in September 1975, allowing more students to participate in a wide variety of musical activities and programs. Garden City would win its first state championship in men's golf in 1977 and progress continued throughout the rest of the decade. The practice gym and locker rooms were added in 1981. In 1984, an idea was conceived among administrators and board members of the school district to recognize past graduates of GCHS who had gone on to distinguish themselves through outstanding accomplishments. This idea was brought into action the following spring, when the first members of the Garden City High School Hall of Fame were inducted. The Buffalo athletics programs struggled throughout the rest of the decade, failing to win a single state championship.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Palmetto Family, a {{conservative}} South Carolina group affiliated with Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council, challenged {{the inclusion of}} Fun Home as a reading selection for incoming freshmen at the College of Charleston. Palmetto Family president Oran Smith called the book [...] "pornographic". Bechdel disputed this, saying that pornography is designed to cause sexual arousal, {{which is not the}} purpose of her book. College provost George Hynd and associate provost Lynne Ford defended the choice of Fun Home, pointing out that its themes of identity are especially appropriate for college freshmen. However, seven months later, the Republican-led South Carolina House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee cut the college's funding by $52,000, the cost of the summer <b>reading</b> <b>program,</b> to punish the college for selecting Fun Home. Rep. Garry Smith, who proposed the cuts, said that in choosing Fun Home the university was [...] "promoting the gay and lesbian lifestyle". Rep. Stephen Goldfinch, another supporter of the cuts, said, [...] "This book trampled on freedom of conservatives. ... Teaching with this book, and the pictures, goes too far." [...] Bechdel called the funding cut [...] "sad and absurd" [...] and pointed out that Fun Home [...] "is after all about the toll that this sort of small-mindedness takes on people's lives." [...] The full state House of Representatives subsequently voted to retain the cuts. College of Charleston students and faculty reacted with dismay and protests to the proposed cuts, and the college's Student Government Association unanimously passed a resolution urging that the funding be restored. A coalition of ten free-speech organizations {{wrote a letter to the}} South Carolina Senate Finance Committee, urging them to restore the funds and warning them that [...] "enalising state educational institutions financially simply because members of the legislature disapprove of specific elements of the educational program is educationally unsound and constitutionally suspect". The letter was co-signed by the National Coalition Against Censorship, the ACLU of South Carolina, the American Association of University Professors, the Modern Language Association, the Association of College and Research Libraries, the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, the Association of American Publishers, the National Council of Teachers of English and the American Library Association. After a nearly week-long debate in which Fun Home and Bechdel were compared to slavery, Charles Manson and Adolf Hitler, the state Senate voted to restore the funding, but redirect the funds towards study of the United States Constitution and The Federalist Papers; the university was also required to provide alternate books to students who object to an assignment due to a [...] "religious, moral or cultural belief". Governor Nikki Haley approved the budget measure penalizing the university.|$|E
