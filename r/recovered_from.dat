5|$|Frigatebirds are unusual among seabirds in {{that they}} often carry blood parasites. Blood-borne {{protozoa}} of the genus Haemoproteus have been <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> {{four of the five}} species. Bird lice of the ischnoceran genus Pectinopygus and amblyceran genus Colpocephalum and species Fregatiella aurifasciata have been <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> magnificent and great frigatebirds of the Galapagos Islands. Frigatebirds tended to have more parasitic lice than did boobies analysed in the same study.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic {{protozoa}} of {{the genus}} Sarcocystis have been <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the smooth muscles of adult American white ibis, and another species, Haemoproteus plataleae, has been <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the blood of adults and nestlings, and can hence be transmitted before the young leave the nest. The larvae of two species of mite of the family Hypoderidae, Phalacrodectes whartoni and Neoattialges eudocimae, have been <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> under the skin. Two species of the louse suborder Mallophaga, Plegadiphilus eudocimus and Ardeicola robusta, also parasitise the bird.|$|E

40|$|Inducible and {{constitutive}} β-galactosidase {{formation and}} radioactive amino acid incorporation were measured in cells <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> various treatments which inhibit protein synthesis in the cell. Undelayed β-galactosidase formation {{was found in}} stringent auxotrophs <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> amino acid starvation, in cells <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> glycerol or potassium starvation, and in bacteria <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> puromycin treatment. Delayed β-galactosidase formation was found in relaxed auxotrophs <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> amino acid starvation and in prototrophs <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> chloramphenicol or from tetracycline treatment. The length of this delay was directly proportional to {{the duration of the}} treatment. All cells <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> the various treatments exhibited a slightly decreased rate of β-galactosidase formation and an increase in radioactive amino acid incorporation...|$|R

5|$|Although much of Britain {{from this}} time is now beneath the sea, remains have been {{discovered}} on land that show horses were present, and being hunted, in this period. Significant finds include a horse tooth dating from between 55,000 and 47,000BC and horse bones dating from between 50,000 and 45,000BC, <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> Pin Hole Cave, in the Creswell Crags ravine in the North Midlands; further horse remains from the same era have been <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> Kent's Cavern. In Robin Hood Cave, also in Creswell Crags, a horse tooth was recovered dating from between 32,000 and 24,000BC; this cave has also preserved {{one of the earliest}} examples of prehistoric artwork in Britain– an engraving of a horse, on a piece of horse bone. A goddess figurine carved from horse bone and dating from around 23,000BC has been <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> Paviland Cave in South Wales.|$|E

40|$|<b>Recovering</b> <b>from</b> {{processor}} {{failures in}} distributed sys-tems {{is an important}} problem {{in the design and}} development of reliable systems. Several solutions to this problem have been presented in the literature. Most of them <b>recover</b> <b>from</b> failures by storing sufficient extra information in stable storage and using this information when there are failures. In this paper, we present two solutions to this problem which involve very little overhead. Without appending any information to the messages of the application pro-gram, we show {{that it is possible to}} <b>recover</b> <b>from</b> failures using O(IVIIEI) messages where IVI is the number of processors and IEl is the number of com-munication links in the system. The second algorithm can be used to <b>recover</b> <b>from</b> processor failures without forcing non-faulty processors to roll back under certain conditions. With a small modification, the second algorithm can also be used to <b>recover</b> <b>from</b> processor failures even if no stable storage is avail-able. 1...|$|R

5|$|Conservation of the {{propeller}} was completed {{nearly three years}} after its recovery and it is {{on display in the}} Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum. As of 2013, conservation of the engine, its components, the turret and the guns continues. The Dahlgren guns were removed from the turret in September 2004 and placed in their own conservation tanks. Among some of the artifacts <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the sunken vessel was a red signal lantern, possibly the one used to send a distress signal to Rhode Island and the last thing to be seen before Monitor sank in 1862 – it was the first object <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the site in 1977.

5|$|Former {{prisoners of}} war were given a high {{priority}} for repatriation back to Australia and discharge. Planning for the recovery of prisoners of the Japanese, most of whom had been held in harsh conditions, had begun in 1944 and the 2nd and 3rd Australian Prisoner of War Reception Groups were established at Singapore and Manila respectively in August 1945. By the end of September most of the prisoners <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> Singapore, Java and Sumatra had been returned to Australia along with about half of those <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the Bangkok area. Transport shortages delayed the repatriation of Australian prisoners from Formosa, Japan and Korea, but almost all were on their way home by mid-September.|$|E
