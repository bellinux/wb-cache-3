Over the rest of the music video, the singer is shown meeting her love interest face to face two more times, including a performance of the song to a bar's crowd in which he is featured, sporting a white dress and head accessory. Her suitor ends struggling with alcohol issues. Scenes interspersed through the main video present the singer laying over the abandoned vehicle, and playing the piano in her room.|$|E

25|$|Representing {{the danger}} of the Cowboys to the {{business}} owners and citizens, on Saturday, March25, 1882, Martin R. Peel of the Tombstone Milling and Mining Company near Charleston was murdered by two masked men. They simply walked in on the mill superintendent, Peel, and a third man and shot Peel through the heart at such close range that his clothing was set on fire.

25|$|Not able to {{live with}} the guilt anymore and with {{encouragement}} from Stuart's ghost, Kendall refuses to bargain and confesses to the murder, being sentenced to live in prison. Zach is able to get Kendall out of prison by paying a Kendall lookalike a large sum of money (according to Jesse) in order to pose as her in prison. He is able to give Kendall a room in the house where she is to remain, not to come out for any reason, even to check on Ian and Spike. When asking Zach why she cannot stay in his <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> Kendall concludes that it is because she slept with Ryan and that Zach has not forgiven her, which he confirms. He tells her that he will not forgive anyone anymore, not even Kendall. He does tell her that she is his wife and that he will protect her and his children no matter what.|$|E
25|$|Just {{after finding}} Laurie, Jill is {{killed by a}} scalpel-wielding Michael, who then pursues Laurie through the {{hospital}}. Laurie escapes {{to the parking lot}} and hides in Jimmy's car. Regaining consciousness, Jimmy exits the hospital and gets in the car to seek help, but he falls unconscious on the steering wheel horn because of his injuries, alerting Michael to their location. Loomis, Marion, and the marshal get to the hospital just in time to save Laurie. Loomis shoots Michael five more times. As Marion attempts to contact the police, Michael kills the marshal and chases Loomis and Laurie into an operating room. Michael stabs Loomis in the stomach, wounding him, but Laurie shoots Michael in the eyes, blinding him. Loomis and Laurie fill the room with ether and oxygen gas. Loomis orders Laurie to run and sacrifices himself by igniting the gas, which blows up the operating <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and Michael inside. Michael emerges from the room, engulfed in flames, before he collapses and finally dies. Early the next morning, Laurie is put in an ambulance and driven to safety.|$|E

500|$|In February 2011, Navarro filed a [...] "violent emotion" [...] defense {{with the}} court, arguing that Van der Sloot had {{entered into a}} state of {{temporary}} insanity because Flores found out about his connection to Holloway from his laptop computer. Under Peruvian law, if the judge accepts this crime of passion argument, the sentence for such a plea could be reduced to only 3 to 5 years; Navarro noted that this could allow Van der Sloot to be eligible for parole in as soon as 20 months. Oscar González of the Peruvian police stated that an examination of Van der Sloot's laptop determined that Flores did not access such information while she was in the hotel <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
500|$|Mulder {{meets the}} mysterious [...] "X", who gives him {{information}} on a secret military project that Grissom performed where he eradicated the need for sleep through lobotomy. X provides him {{with the name of}} Salvatore Matola, a squad member who was mistakenly reported as killed in action. A man matching Cole's description robs a drug store. Mulder and Krycek arrive, but not before two gunshots are heard from the room where Cole is believed to be. It appears that the two officers in the <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> shot each other. Cole escapes. Mulder believes that Cole's years of sleeplessness have provided him with illusionary abilities. Mulder and Krycek meet with Matola soon afterwards, who says that he has not slept in twenty-four years due to the experiment. He reveals that there was another doctor who was part of the squad, Dr. Girardi, and that {{he was the one who}} actually performed the lobotomies.|$|E
500|$|While Marlon would {{correspond}} with and eventually marry his wife Carol at 18, Michael never {{had sex with}} groupies, finding his brothers' behavior toward women disgusting. In addition to not touching groupies, Jackson reportedly never {{had an interest in}} having any type of sex as a youngster. In one alleged incident, when he was 15 years old, a male family member arranged for two prostitutes to take his virginity. They were told to [...] "work him over", before being locked in a <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Instead Michael picked up a Bible and read bible verses to the girls. The girls left in tears. James McField, who worked with The Jackson 5, stated that the lead singer of the band often needed someone to talk with. It was at these times that women would be introduced to him for companionship. McField asserted that he never witnessed anything sexual, and that such females were not Jackson's type; [...] "He liked nice girls, pure girls who appeared to have no street background." ...|$|E

2500|$|Increasing media {{scrutiny}} {{based upon}} allegations by former members placed further pressure on Jones in 1977, in particular, {{an article by}} Marshall Kilduff in New West Magazine. Just before publication of the New West piece, editor Rosalie Wright telephoned Jones to read him the article. Wright explained that she was only doing so before publication because of [...] "all the support letters we received on your behalf, from the Governor of California (Jerry Brown)" [...] and others. While still on the phone listening to the allegations contained in the article, Jones wrote a note to Temple members in the <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> that said, [...] "We leave tonight.

2500|$|Significant changes {{happened}} in 1816. Schober, {{a student and}} of good family and some means, invited Schubert to <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> at his mother's house. The proposal was particularly opportune, for Schubert had just made the unsuccessful application for the post of kapellmeister at Laibach, and he had also decided not to resume teaching duties at his father's school. By {{the end of the}} year, he became a guest in Schober's lodgings. For a time, he attempted to increase the household resources by giving music lessons, but they were soon abandoned, and he devoted himself to composition. [...] "I compose every morning, and when one piece is done, I begin another." [...] During this year, he focused on orchestral and choral works, although he also continued to write Lieder (songs). Much of this work was unpublished, but manuscripts and copies circulated among friends and admirers.|$|E
2500|$|Coen {{stated that}} this is the brothers' [...] "first adaptation". He further {{explained}} why they chose the novel: [...] "Why not start with Cormac? Why not start with the best?" [...] He further described this McCarthy book in particular as [...] "unlike his other novels... it is much pulpier." [...] Coen stated that they have not changed much in the adaptation. [...] "It really is just compression," [...] he said. [...] "We didn't create new situations." [...] He further assured that he and his brother Ethan had never met McCarthy when they were writing the script, but first met him during the shooting of the film. He believed that the author liked the film, while his brother Ethan said, [...] "he didn't yell at us. We were actually sitting in a movie theater/screening <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> when he saw it... and I heard him chuckle a couple of times, so I took that as a seal of approval, I don't know, maybe presumptuously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rolfe was an {{enthusiastic}} letter writer. [...] John Holden recalled that [...] "Corvo {{was one of}} those men who never speak a word if they can write it. We lived in the same house, a very little one, yet he would always communicate with me by note if I was not in the same <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> He had dozens of letter books. He seized upon every opportunity for writing a letter, and every letter, whether to a publisher or to a cobbler, was written with the same care." [...] About a thousand of his letters have survived, and several sequences of them have been published in limited editions. [...] The letters reveal a lively, intelligent and absorbent mind, but because of Rolfe’s paranoiac tendencies they are often disputatious and recriminatory. [...] Among the commentators who rated Rolfe’s letters more highly than his fiction was W H Auden, who wrote that Rolfe [...] "had every right to be proud of his verbal claws … A large vocabulary is essential to the invective style, and Rolfe by study and constant practice became one of the great masters of vituperation." [...] The letters have yet to be collected into a single scholarly edition.|$|E
25|$|Bennett {{moved to}} Calgary in 1897. A lifelong {{bachelor}} and teetotaler (although Bennett was known by select associates to occasionally drink alcohol when {{the press was}} not around to observe this), he led a rather lonely life in a hotel and later, in a boarding house. For a while a younger brother <b>roomed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> He ate his noon meal on workdays at the Alberta Hotel. Social life, such as it was, centred on church. There was, however, no scandal attached to his personal life. Bennett worked hard and gradually built up his legal practice. In 1908 {{he was one of}} five people appointed to the first Library Board for the city of Calgary and was instrumental in establishing the Calgary Public Library.|$|R
50|$|During {{the years}} between 1895 and 1900, Nakhlé {{certainly}} studied, like his brothers, who already lived in France and enjoyed there a great reputation among the Ottomans who lived there. It appears that he became during that time a friend of Rachîd, sultan Abdûl Hamid's brother. In this way, he entered into opposition to his brothers and his sister Victoria. However, between April 1906 and 1908 he lived in Paris in a mansion in the Avenue des Champs-Elysées, 71. He paid a rent of 9,000 francs per year which wasn't little at that time. His brother Nadra divided the <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> for some time. Since Nadra was allied with the Young Turks, this means that their different political attitudes didn't affect very much their personal relations.|$|R

2500|$|Both Heather and Mae West {{became the}} focus of Fred's incestuous sexual attentions after Anna Marie ran away from home at age 15 in 1979 after {{enduring}} a particularly severe beating from Rose to her stomach just days after being discharged from hospital for treatment of an ectopic pregnancy. The frequency of the abuse endured by Heather and Mae increased when both girls hit puberty. Fred was both overt and unapologetic in his conduct, and would justify his actions with the simple explanation: [...] "I made you; I can do what I like with you." [...] He would further refer to his intentions to impregnate both his daughters on at least one occasion, and would occasionally force all his children to watch pornography with him. As Heather, Mae and their younger brother Stephen were very close in age, the trio resolved that if their father asked either of the two girls to be alone in a <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> they would only do so if at least one other member of the trio were present to avoid either girl being raped. In addition, both girls developed a regime whereby they would only shower or undress when their father was either out of the house, or as her sister stood guard at the door. Stephen himself was also informed by his father he would have to have sex with his mother by the age of 17 (although his parents would evict him from their home at age 16).|$|E

[...] It is implied {{that she is}} a Morisco; Pablos writes: Sospechábase en el pueblo que no era cristiana vieja ("It was whispered in town that she was not an old Christian [...]") [...] Pablos' brother, also a thief, was flogged to death in prison. [...] Pablos wishes to go to school, and his parents agree to let him go. [...] At school, he befriends a boy named Don Diego Coronel, but Pablos suffers various setbacks there. [...] Pablos decides to neither return to school nor home, and remains as the friend and companion of Don Diego, who also decides to leave school. [...] Diego’s father, Don Alonso, decides to make both boys wards of a man named Dómine Cabra, in Segovia. [...] The two boys suffer from hunger at the hands of Cabra. [...] When another boy dies of starvation, Alonso removes both boys from the school and sends them off to Alcalá to study. [...] On their way there, they stop at an inn, where Pablos is mocked and hazed by a group of students. [...] At Alcalá, since Pablos is not a gentleman, he is separated from Don Diego, and is hazed and beaten by some university students. [...] During the night, he is beaten again by four students who shared a <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> [...] Pablos then acts out, killing some pigs that did not belong to him, and puts on a party, tricking his landlady into giving him two chickens. [...] He also robs some sweets from a local merchant and some swords from the rector and a justice of the peace. [...] His friends laugh at his antics.|$|E

In the ensuing confusion, Downing encounters the reporter Lil Barstow outside, who tells him about the fate of the former fiancés and persuades him to leave. Lucky asks her, [...] "Couldn't all these have all been accidents?"
