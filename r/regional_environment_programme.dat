The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that sea levels will rise by about 50cm (20in) by 2100 {{due to global}} warming and a further rise would be inevitable. It is thus likely that within a century the nation's arable land will become subject to increased soil salination and will be largely submerged.|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} concern within Timor Leste that upland land use practices {{have led to}} marked increases in erosion and landslides with a subsequent increase in sedimentation and nutrient pollution in waterways, estuaries and the adjacent coastal zone and seas, but no scientific studies {{has been done to}} identify what actually is going on. This activity is a joint initiative between the UNDP <b>Regional</b> <b>Environment</b> Governance <b>Programme,</b> Government of Timor-Leste, UNDP Timor-Leste and ATSEF attempting to carry out a preliminary assessment to identify the effect of present and future land use practices on estuaries and coastal productivity in Timor Leste and riverine input to the Arafura & Timor Seas region. Community capacity will also be enhanced to take a much more proactive role in the decision making process of policies that affect their livelihood. A multidisciplinary and integrated approach would be used, covering both biophyisical and social apsects. The study will ultimately suggest management options to minimize degradation of natural resources in these catchment and coastal systems including contaminants to the adjacent sea...|$|R

It does this by engaging countries that share the western Indian Ocean in actions to protect their shared marine environment. The Contracting Parties (Comoros, France, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Somalia, Tanzania and the Republic of South Africa) to the Convention are part of more than 143 countries that participate in 18 Regional Seas initiatives.|$|R

Under the Majuro Declaration, which was signed on 5 September 2013, Tuvalu has commitment to implement power generation of 100% renewable energy (between 2013 and 2020), which is proposed to be implemented using Solar PV (95% of demand) and biodiesel (5% of demand). The feasibility of wind power generation will be considered.
