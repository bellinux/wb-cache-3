5|$|<b>Relatively</b> <b>speaking,</b> bites {{from this}} species are not highly dangerous. In Britain {{there have been}} only 14 known {{fatalities}} since 1876—the last a 5-year-old child in 1975—and one near fatal bite of a 39-year-old woman in Essex in 1998. An 82-year-old woman died following a bite in Germany in 2004, although {{it is not clear whether}} her death was due to the effect of the venom. Even so, professional medical help should always be sought as soon as possible after any bite. Very occasionally bites can be life-threatening, particularly in small children, while adults may experience discomfort and disability long after the bite. The length of recovery varies, but may take up to a year.|$|E

25|$|<b>Relatively</b> <b>speaking,</b> {{the brain}} consumes an immense {{amount of energy}} in {{comparison}} {{to the rest of the}} body. The human brain is approximately 2% of the human body mass and uses 20–25% of the total energy expenditure. Therefore, mechanisms involved in the transfer of energy from foods to neurons are likely to be fundamental to the control of brain function. Insufficient intake of selected vitamins, or certain metabolic disorders, affect cognitive processes by disrupting the nutrient-dependent processes within the body that are associated with the management of energy in neurons, which can subsequently affect neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and cell survival.|$|E

25|$|<b>Relatively</b> <b>speaking,</b> Bucks County {{experiences}} warm/hot {{and humid}} summers with chilly/cold and somewhat snowy winters. Episodes of high humidity (dew point >= 70°F) occur every year during {{or close to}} the summer months, very occasionally reaching extreme (dew point >= 75°F) levels. When high-to-extreme humidity combines with air temperatures in the mid-upper 90's, dangerous heat index values of >= 105°F can sometimes result. Winter minimum air temperatures occasionally fall into the single-digits to slightly below-0°F. When the coldest temperatures combine with higher winds, wind chill values can sometimes plummet below-0°F to as cold as -20°F. Spring and fall are comparatively tranquil. The climate cools as one moves from the lower elevation, dense suburban areas in southern Bucks, to the higher elevation, rural areas of northern Bucks. Precipitation is fairly well-distributed throughout the year. The average seasonal snowfall, which can potentially occur from as early as October to as late as April, is around 2 feet in extreme southern Bucks, and around 3 feet in the highest elevations of far northern Bucks. The fall foliage season typically peaks in mid-October in northern Bucks, mid-late October in central Bucks, and late-October / early-November in southern Bucks. These dates correlate with the typical date of first freeze. Peak spring foliage usually occurs {{during the month of}} April, which correlates with the typical date of last freeze.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{studies are}} {{reported}} that {{examine the relationship}} between musical mode and tempo in Western classical music. In the first study, modes were determined for 331 works bearing the tempo markings largo, adagio, allegro, or presto. Slower tempo markings are significantly more likely {{to be associated with the}} minor mode in the case of music from the Baroque and Classical periods, whereas the reverse trend is observed in music from the Romantic period. In the second study, an analysis of 21 audio recordings of theme-and-variation keyboard movements (from all three style periods) shows that variations written in the minor mode are performed more slowly than neighboring variations in the major mode. These tempo-related observations are largely consistent with research in speech prosody, which has shown that sad speakers <b>speak</b> <b>relatively</b> slowly...|$|R
