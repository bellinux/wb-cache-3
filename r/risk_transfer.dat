[...] This activity grew to nearly $15bn of issuance in 2006 following the disruptions in the underlying markets caused by Hurricane Katrina and Regulation XXX.

2500|$|Some {{communities}} {{prefer to}} create virtual insurance amongst themselves {{by other means}} than contractual <b>risk</b> <b>transfer,</b> which assigns explicit numerical values to risk. A number of religious groups, including the Amish and some Muslim groups, depend on support provided by their communities when disasters strike. The risk presented by any given person is assumed collectively by the community who all bear the cost of rebuilding lost property and supporting people whose needs are suddenly greater after a loss of some kind. In supportive communities where others can be trusted to follow community leaders, this tacit form of insurance can work. [...] In this manner the community can even out the extreme differences in insurability that exist among its members. Some further justification is also provided by invoking the moral hazard of explicit insurance contracts.|$|E
2500|$|Insurance {{is just a}} <b>risk</b> <b>transfer</b> {{mechanism}} {{wherein the}} financial burden which may arise due to some fortuitous event is transferred to a bigger entity called an Insurance Company by way of paying premiums. This only reduces the financial burden and not the actual chances of happening of an event. Insurance is a risk for both the insurance company and the insured. [...] The insurance company understands the risk involved and will perform a risk assessment when writing the policy. [...] As a result, the premiums may go up if they determine that the policyholder will file a claim. [...] If a person is financially stable and plans for life's unexpected events, {{they may be able}} to go without insurance. [...] However, they must have enough to cover a total and complete loss of employment and of their possessions. [...] Some states will accept a surety bond, a government bond, or even making a cash deposit with the state.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how network {{analysis}} can be used for effective cross-border financial surveillance, which requires the monitoring of direct and indirect systemic linkages. Design/methodology/approach – This paper illustrates how network analysis could make a significant contribution in this regard by simulating different credit and funding shocks to the banking systems of a number of selected countries. After that, the authors show that the inclusion of <b>risk</b> <b>transfers</b> could modify the risk profile of entire financial systems, and thus an enriched simulation algorithm able to account for <b>risk</b> <b>transfers</b> is proposed. Findings – Finally, the authors discuss how some of the limitations of the simulations are a reflection of existing information and data gaps, and thus view these shortcomings as a call to improve the collection and analysis of data on cross-border financial exposures. Originality/value – This paper is one of the very few to take a cross-border perspective on financial networks. It is also unique in accounting for <b>risk</b> <b>transfers</b> and in proposing a methodology to include the analysis (and monitoring) of <b>risk</b> <b>transfers</b> into a network model.

The field of alternative <b>risk</b> <b>transfer</b> grew out of a series of insurance capacity crises in the 1970s through 1990s that drove purchasers of traditional coverage to seek more robust ways to buy protection.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the strategic planning of an intermodal transportation chain, and analyses potential <b>risk</b> <b>transfers</b> between agents in the chain derived from the real options embedded in the underlying agreements for the operations of the chain. A planning methodology is presented that enables the calculation of the Expanded Net Present Value (ENPV) when the material resources necessary to carry out the project (fleets and terminals) are not known a priori, and the choice of resources may change throughout the planning period. Based on the results of such planning, we propose methods to assess the <b>transfers</b> of <b>risk</b> among agents in the chain. Specifically, we focus on <b>risks</b> <b>transfers</b> arising from clauses regulating the operation of a compensation fund that can refund those agents who are more exposed to risk derived from uncertainty concerning demand for the service. The article also discusses the terms of the mechanisms that regulate a possible departure of one of the agents. Such clauses are stated in terms of partial or total put and call options. ...|$|R

For this aspiration to be fulfilled, insurers and institutions within which they operate need to learn about emergent risks and develop workable strategies. We explore three factors shaping the evolution of insurance practices - quantitative models of catastrophic loss, experience of catastrophic loss, and outcomes of litigated cases. We use the available evidence to assess the importance {{of each of these}} factors in how the industry is evolving and, hence, what actual <b>risk</b> reductions and <b>transfers</b> are more likely in the future. climate change, insurance, risk management, climate change litigation, insurance modeling and learning...|$|R
