5|$|Hitchcock {{collaborated with}} Grace Kelly on three films: Dial M for Murder (1954), <b>Rear</b> <b>Window</b> (1954) and To Catch a Thief (1955). For <b>Rear</b> <b>Window,</b> Hitchcock {{received}} a nomination for Best Director at the Academy Awards. 1955 marked his debut on television {{as the host}} of the anthology television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents which he also produced. In 1958 Hitchcock directed the psychological thriller Vertigo starring Stewart and Kim Novak. The film topped the 2012 poll of the British film magazine Sight & Sound of the 50 Greatest Films of All Time and also topped the American Film Institute's Top Ten in the mystery genre. He followed this with the spy thriller North by Northwest (1959) which starred Grant and Eva Marie Saint. In 1960 he directed Psycho, the biggest commercial success of his career and for which he received his fifth nomination for Best Director at the Academy Awards. Three years later he directed horror film The Birds starring Tippi Hedren. The following year he reunited with Hedren on the film Marnie which also starred Sean Connery.|$|E

50|$|Ford imports all Transit Connects as {{passenger}} vehicles with <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>rear</b> seats, and rear seat-belts {{to circumvent the}} 25% tariff on imported light trucks. The vehicles are exported from Turkey on cargo ships owned by Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics, arrive in Baltimore, and are converted into commercial vehicles at WWL Vehicle Services Americas Inc. facility: <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> are replaced with metal panels and rear seats removed (except on wagons). The removed parts are recycled.|$|R
25|$|For film {{projection}} systems, Digital Theater Systems, the company behind the DTS surround sound standard, {{has created a}} digital captioning device called the DTS-CSS (Cinema Subtitling System). It {{is a combination of}} a laser projector which places the captioning (words, sounds) anywhere on the screen and a thin playback device with a CD that holds many languages. If the <b>Rear</b> <b>Window</b> Captioning System is used, the DTS-CSS player is also required for sending caption text to the <b>Rear</b> <b>Window</b> sign located {{in the rear of the}} theater.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{photography}} {{has raised}} {{a number of}} concerns on its effect on society. In Alfred Hitchcock's <b>Rear</b> <b>Window</b> (1954), the camera is presented as promoting voyeurism. 'Although the camera is an observation station, the act of photographing is more than passive observing'.|$|E

25|$|All 1965 Olds models {{featured}} all new {{styling and}} engineering. The B-body cars featured more rounded styling than previous years with Coke-bottle profiles and semi-fastback rooflines on Holiday (two-door hardtop) coupes - Jetstar I and Starfire coupes got a more rounded {{variation of the}} squared-off 1963–64 roofline with concave <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> shared by Pontiac's Grand Prix.|$|E

50|$|The basic Electrique {{does not}} come with <b>rear</b> seats or <b>windows.</b> It is common for owners to install a {{compatible}} (Multispace) rear seat and <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> in countries where this is allowed (not in France).|$|R
25|$|Supreme V had a {{completely}} different rear design showing the styling of the next range that was probably under development. Tall heavily featured light clusters that were tinted to look dark were fitted vertically between the boot lid. The <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> was a one piece design. The seat backs were no longer visible from outside the coach.|$|E
25|$|In November 1961, Knudsen {{had moved}} to Chevrolet. Pete Estes now became general manager of Pontiac and Delorean was {{promoted}} to Pontiac Chief engineer. Both continued Knudsen's work of making Pontiac a performance-car brand. Pontiac capitalized on the emerging trend toward sportier bucket-seat coupes in 1962 by introducing the Grand Prix, taking {{the place of the}} Ventura which now became a trim option on the Catalina. Although GM officially ended factory support for all racing activities across all of its brands in January 1963, Pontiac continued to cater to performance car enthusiasts by making larger engines with more power available across all model lines. For 1963, the Grand Prix received the same styling changes as other full-sized Pontiacs such as vertical headlights and crisper body lines, but also received its own squared-off roof-line with a concave <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> along with less chrome. This concave <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> would be duplicated on all Tempest/LeMans four-door intermediates in 1964-1965.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1971 Pontiac {{introduced}} the compact, budget-priced Ventura II (based {{on the third}} generation Chevrolet Nova). This same year, Pontiac completely restyled its full-sized cars, moved the Bonneville, {{and replaced it with}} a higher luxury model named the Grand Ville, while Safari wagons got a new clamshell tailgate that lowered into the body while the <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> raised into the roof.|$|E

40|$|The {{glass surface}} of cars has {{increased}} {{very much in}} the last years by the application of the oblique front and <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> and by the new design of car windows. Sun can enter freely in the car. Apparently this is perceived by many vehicle occupants as a hindrance, considering the increasing use of sun screening divisors for the <b>rear</b> and side <b>windows.</b> By the limitation of the outlook and perspicacity the presence of these equipments on the side and <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> can {{have a negative effect on}} traffic safety...|$|R

25|$|In the exterior, Honda updates {{the front}} with larger air intakes {{on the lower}} front fascia, {{installs}} new head- and taillights, and has new wheel designs. The new grille comes with a blue stripe that Honda says represents the car’s “high-tech hybrid identity.” A thinner rear spoiler and a more compactly mounted rear wiper motor help to improve visibility through the <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Alliance was a 2- or 4-door sedan, {{launched}} in June 1982 as a 1983 model after a US$150 million overhaul of AMC's Kenosha, Wisconsin, assembly plant. Although marketed as a Renault, the car carried AMC's logo on a <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> decal and was officially {{classified as a}} domestic automobile as it was manufactured with more than 70% U.S.-produced parts.|$|E
25|$|In October 1983, <b>Rear</b> <b>Window</b> and Vertigo {{were the}} first two films re-released by Hitchcock's estate after his death. These two films and three others– The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), The Trouble with Harry (1955), and Rope (1948)– had been kept out of {{distribution}} by Hitchcock since 1968. Cleaning and restoration were performed on each film when new 35mm prints were struck.|$|E
