50|$|Initially, T-1 trunks {{were used}} only to connect major {{telephone}} exchanges, via the same twisted pair copper wire that the analog trunks used. One transmit pair, one <b>receive</b> <b>pair.</b> If the exchanges were too far apart, a repeater boosted the signal.|$|E
5000|$|Phase 0 (Lobe Check) â€” A station first {{performs}} a lobe media check. A station is wrapped at the MSAU {{and is able}} to send 2000 test frames down its transmit pair which will loop back to its <b>receive</b> <b>pair.</b> The station checks to ensure it can receive these frames without error.|$|E
50|$|Physical {{transmission}} uses differential signaling. The SATA PHY {{contains a}} transmit pair and <b>receive</b> <b>pair.</b> When the SATA-link {{is not in}} use (example: no device attached), the transmitter allows the transmit pins to float to their common-mode voltage level. When the SATA-link is either active or in the link-initialization phase, the transmitter drives the transmit pins at the specified differential voltage (1.5 V in SATA/I).|$|E

50|$|The 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX Ethernet {{standards}} use one {{wire pair}} for transmission in each direction. This {{requires that the}} transmit pair of each device {{be connected to the}} <b>receive</b> <b>pair</b> of the device on the other end. The 10BASE-T standard was devised to be used with already existing twisted pair cable installations with straight-through connections, and so it required a simple scheme for plugging devices together.|$|E
50|$|If player <b>receives</b> a <b>pair,</b> player wins his bet doubled.|$|R
5000|$|Type V is {{the most}} common variant in use outside United States. In {{contrast}} to Type I, both ends of the connection indicate a call by grounding the relevant lead. This means that it is easy to interconnect two PABXs [...] "back-to-back" [...] by crossing over the E&M leads and transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>pairs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Since the two {{signals are}} on {{different}} pairs {{there is no}} characteristic change in the signal. Collisions are only recognized on UTP when the station is operating in half-duplex. The only functional difference between half and full-duplex operation {{in this regard is}} whether or not the transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>pairs</b> are permitted to be used simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Trident <b>received</b> a <b>pair</b> of 10-inch (85 cwt) {{guns and}} two (later four) 32-pounder gunnades.|$|R
50|$|The {{magnitude}} of the cross-correlation output reflects the channel fading between the corresponding transmit and <b>receive</b> antenna <b>pair.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gigabit {{and faster}} Ethernet links over twisted pair cable use all four cable pairs for {{simultaneous}} transmission in both directions. For this reason, {{there are no}} dedicated transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>pairs,</b> and consequently, crossover cables are never required for 1000BASE-T communication. The {{physical medium attachment sublayer}} (PMA) provides identification of each pair and usually continues to work even over cables where the pairs are unusually swapped or crossed.|$|R

40|$|Let an EPR source which generates maximally {{entangled}} pairs {{be located}} {{so that it}} has distances $L_ 1 $ and $L_ 2 $ to two users. How the entanglement of the <b>received</b> <b>pair</b> depends on these distances and the local properties of the channels used for this transmission? What is the best location of the source {{if we want to}} achieve the highest efficiency? We discuss these problems for two classes of channels, namely the Pauli channel and the amplitude damping channel...|$|R
5000|$|A line painted {{along the}} long {{axis of the}} table to create doubles courts bisects the table. This line's only purpose is to {{facilitate}} the doubles service rule, which is that service must originate from the right hand [...] "box" [...] {{in such a way}} that the first bounce of the serve bounces once in said right hand box and then must bounce at least once in the opponent side's right hand box (far left box for server), or the <b>receiving</b> <b>pair</b> score a point.|$|R
50|$|In {{subsequent}} games, {{the winners}} of the previous game serve first. Matches are best out of three: a player or pair must win two games (of 21 points each) to win the match. For the first rally of any doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the <b>receiving</b> <b>pair</b> may decide who receives. The players change ends {{at the start of the}} second game; if the match reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading player's or pair's score reaches 11 points.|$|R
50|$|In a {{departure}} from both 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T and faster use all four cable pairs for simultaneous transmission in both directions {{through the use of}} adaptive equalization and a five-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-5) technique. For this reason, there are no dedicated transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>pairs,</b> and consequently, crossover cables are never required for 1000BASE-T, 2.5GBASE-T, 5GBASE-T, 10GBASE-T, and 40GBASE-T communication. From 1000BASE-T onwards the physical medium attachment sublayer (PMA) provides identification of each pair and usually continues to work even over cable where the pairs are unusually swapped or crossed.|$|R
