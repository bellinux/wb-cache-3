40|$|Today, a {{new form}} of word of mouth (WOM) called {{electronic}} word-of-mouth (eWOM) is an emerging communication channel. eWOM, unlike traditional WOM, is traceable so strategically manageable. In this paper, one type of eWOM, online consumer review, is investigated to analyze which factors influence consumer decision making. In previous research, analysis of the relationship between expertise and WOM was inconsistent. This study explains the contradiction with the cognitive fit theory by considering a moderating role of <b>review</b> <b>type,</b> one factor of the review structure. This study shows that cognitive fit occurs when experts process the reviews framed as being attribute-centric, while it occurs when novices process the reviews framed as being benefit-centric. Also, the effect of <b>review</b> <b>type</b> on purchase intention is stronger for consumers with high expertise than those with low expertise. The number of reviews, another factor of the review structure, also influences consumer information processing. This study applies the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to investigate the effect of the number of reviews. This study shows that the effect of the number of reviews on purchase intention is stronger for consumers with low expertise than those with high expertise. Our findings have implications for online sellers about how to manage online consumer reviews...|$|E

This result {{indicates that the}} levels of consensus in Set 1 and Set 2 are weak and moderate, respectively. The averaged ranking result is shown in Figure  2, which suggests that perceived expertise does not increase linearly when review balance ranged from extremely positive to extremely negative.

40|$|BACKGROUND PRISMA {{guidelines}} {{have been}} developed to improve the reporting of systematic reviews (SRs). Other reporting guidelines and techniques to assess methodological quality of SRs {{have been developed}}. We aimed to assess the frequency of the use of reporting and other guidelines in SRs to assess whether PRISMA is being used inappropriately as a substitute for other relevant guidelines. METHODS Web of Knowledge was searched to identify articles citing the PRISMA guidelines over a 12 -month period. The use of reporting guidelines (including PRISMA and MOOSE) and tools for assessing methodological quality (including QUADAS) was assessed. Factors associated with appropriate use of guidelines including <b>review</b> <b>type,</b> field of publication and involvement of a methodologist were investigated. RESULTS Over the 12 -month period, 701 SRs were identified. MOOSE guidelines were cited in just 17...|$|E

For the literature review, we collected data by searching electronic databases to identify relevant studies. Search terms included guidance, counselling, supervision, mentoring, coaching, instruction, scaffolding, modeling, explanation, reflection and explorations in combination with the terms apprenticeship, workplace learning, on-the-job learning, work-based, vocational training and vocational education. In addition to searching through electronic databases, we manually searched the archives of journals focusing on workplace learning and vocational education.|$|E

30|$|Initially 2047 {{records were}} identified. After {{assessing}} eligibility, six reviews were included. These reviews varied in their <b>review</b> <b>type</b> and focus. Different issues arose at distinct {{stages of the}} implementation process. Organisations needed to invest time and resources in two key stages early in the implementation process: ‘designing’ the processes for using PROMs within an organisation; and ‘preparing’ an organisation and its staff. The ‘designing’ stage involved organisations planning not just which PROMs to use and how to administer them, but also how the data {{would be used for}} clinical purposes. The ‘preparing’ stage involved getting an organisation and its staff ready to use PROMs, particularly persuading clinicians of the validity and value of PROMs, delivering training, and developing electronic systems. Having an implementation lead overseeing the process and developing the process based on feedback were also identified as facilitating implementation.|$|E
