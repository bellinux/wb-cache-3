40|$|Evaluation <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> {{programmes}} {{is essential}} in order to monitor its effectiveness and relevance.

A narrative review of national and international disability legislation and empirical research in context <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> was conducted. The findings of this review reveals that as a fluid construct, the discourse <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> has been underpinned by the changing theoretical and socio-political understandings of disability. This in turn has influenced various international and national health and disability policies and legislations that oversee the implementation <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> practice.
