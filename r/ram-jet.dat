5000|$|A V-2 was {{modified}} {{to carry a}} test device called the [...] "Organ," [...] a series of test diffusers (ramjet air intakes) which was to make measurements of pressures. That first Hermes II test missile (missile 0) was launched on 29 May 1947 and landed in Mexico causing an international incident. WSPG V-2 #44 carried a test <b>ram-jet</b> diffuser. The successful flight returned data from Mach 3.6 and made GE confident it could proceed with a two-stage test. Progress was slow which frustrated Von Braun. The next Hermes II, (missile 1), the first to have the wings containing the ramjets, was launched by GE on 13 January 1949 and broke up shortly after liftoff due to unanticipated vibrations. There were two further Hermes flights missile #2 on 6 October 1949, which suffered the fate of missile 1. Missile 2-A on 9 November 1950. Missile 2-A did not break up, but the <b>ram-jet</b> never started. When the Von Braun team transferred to Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, their primary mission was still a Mach 3.3 <b>ram-jet</b> cruise missile. In May 1950 Hermes II was reduced to research only status. At that time Ordnance transferred the Mach 4 Hermes B from GE to Huntsville. September 1950 saw GE's Hermes C-1 study transferred to Huntsville where it evolved into the very successful Redstone.

Though this method is simple and eliminates torque reaction, prototypes that have been built are less fuel efficient than conventional helicopters.

40|$|Solid rocket {{propellants}} have various applications, includ-ing weapons, satellites, and air bag technology. In these applications {{burn rate}} and pattern prediction are important parameters in predicting ballistic motor performances and motor design. While existing equations accurately predict burn rates for most solid engine propellants, these stan-dard equations do not adequately capture rates associated with certain engine formations, such as Solid Fuel <b>Ram-jets</b> (SFRJ) and some Solid Rocket Motors (SRM). The propellant burning rates in SFRJ and SRM are not homo-geneous due to several factors, {{such as the}} flowfield, edge effects, etc. To overcome this deficiency, Atlantic Re-search Corporation (ARC) is developing a novel ultra-sound technology to measure burn rate directly. Techni-cal challenges arise, however, when the echo of the propellant surface is weak and difficult to detect, because of limited ultrasonic power, the mismatch of case and propellant impedance, and associated electronic and mag-netic noises. Thus, the main objective of this project is to accurately recognize the echo of sound waves from time-series data corrupted by noise. In this paper, the design, testing, and implementation of an algorithm to extract burn rate profiles from ultrasound measurements is dis-cussed.

50|$|Born in Norfolk {{and raised}} in Great Yarmouth before being {{evacuated}} to Oxford during the Second World War, {{he went to a}} sea training school (TS. Mercury, Hamble) at the age of 14. Larn taught himself to dive in 1947, using a German-made Dr√§ger U-boat escape set in the River Thames. He then joined the Merchant Navy where he served his apprenticeship as a deck-officer with the South American Saint Line and eventually became 2nd Mate. In 1950 he transferred to the Royal Navy where he stayed for 22 years. As a Chief Petty Officer Mechanician/diver he served in Korea and initiated diving from Dragonfly helicopters to recover <b>ram-jet</b> un-manned gunnery target drone aircraft off Malta, being dropped into the sea wearing diving equipment with Petty Officer John Guppy, up to five miles offshore, to assist a rescue tug in recovering the targets intact. They were possibly the first divers in the Royal Navy to operate using diving apparatus from helicopters, long before SAR divers. He also participated in diving expeditions all over the world. Larn then specialised in air-launched weapons, Firestreak, Redtop, Sidewinder, Bullpup, Mk.43 and 44 homing torpedoes, and the 2000lb HEMC nuclear bomb, and was Chief Petty Officer i/c the Guided Weapons Section on board HMS Hermes for three years, which required Positive Security Vetting to Top Secret - Atomic.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of air-launched <b>ram-jet</b> engines {{has been extended}} to include a study of models with a nominal design free-stream Mach number of 2. 40.

40|$|Increasing fuel {{efficiency}} {{has been a}} goal for chemists for several decades. Particularly, a more efficient fuel can increase the range of liquid-hydrocarbon-fueled <b>ram-jets</b> and cruise missiles. A storable high-energy fuel that spontaneously ignites upon addition of an oxidizer {{is defined as a}} hypergolic fuel. Hypergolic storable fuels provide an increase in energy per unit volume of fuel and eliminate the need for an external ignition system. Several classes of functionalized hydrocarbons such as amines, boranes, and phosphines are known to be hypergolic with nitric acid oxidizers, but only hydrazine and its simple derivatives 5 have been found to exhibit true hypergolic behavior with H 2 O 2. Hydrogen peroxide is a good candidate for an oxidizer due to its reduced toxicity and improved storage capability. Hydrazine-based fuels are expensive, highly corrosive, and toxic, thus providing the need for investigation of other fuels that may be hypergolic with H 2 O 2. Strained hydrocarbons have been studied as high-density fuels. Some examples including benzvalene and cubane, exhibit an increase in heat of combustion as the density of the fuel increases. Many conventional hydrocarbon fuels, such as JP- 5 and JP- 10, show a decrease in heat of combustion as density of the fuel increases. Strained hydrocarbons can therefore increase the range of the missile by increasing the combustion efficiency per volume of fuel. The goal of this research is to investigate hypergolic behavior of strained hydrocarbons by adding an amine functional group which has been found to hypergolic with nitric acid oxidizers. N,N-Dimethyl-[3]-triangulane- 7 -methylamine (l), cyclopropylamines (2), cyclobutylamines (3), propylamines (4), and butylamines (5) were synthesized and investigated. The amino group should react with oxygen, providing the initiation step for ring decomposition. The highly exothermic reactions will accumulate energy and potentially lead to spontaneous ignition of the fuel. Triangulanes possess high strain energy, while the less strained cyclopropane and cyclobutanes are more volatile and may show shorter ignition times...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulations}} on the emissions from combustion devices {{are getting more}} and more strict for environmental and human health reasons. Modern combustion research faces two major challenges; reduction of the pollutants, such as CO, NOx and unburnt hydro- carbons and increase of the combustion efficiency. Current trend for stationary power generation is to use lean premixed and/or pre-vaporized combustors, close to blow-off limit. Besides the beneficial effects of lower emissions and improved performance, the use of lean, near blow-off combustion gives rise to combustion instabilities that can lead to flashback, blow-off as well as acoustical and mechanical vibrations. A clear under- standing of the dynamics of the flame and the flow under lean conditions has not been reached yet. This is where the contributions of this thesis lie. In this work, advanced techniques, namely, Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) based models, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and wavelet-analysis have been applied to analyze both stable and unstable lean flames. Maintaining stable flame is difficult when the flame speed of any practical fuel is several orders of magnitude smaller than the flow velocity and a flame holding mechanism is required. Stabilization may be achieved primarily by swirl or jet induced recirculating flow or by a bluff-body flame holder. Bluff-bodies as flame-holders are found {{in a wide range of}} high-speed reacting environments, e. g. <b>ram-jets,</b> scram-jets and turbojet after- burners. Primary goals of this study were to examine in detail the possibility of modeling a flame close to blow-off and during the blow-off, and furthermore to extract the dynamics of a bluff body flame under stable flame and close to blow-off conditions. In the end, based on the LES results, some of the modern theories of bluff-body flames approaching blow-off were critically assessed. The findings were summarized and a hypothesis on the full sequence of events leading to blow-off was proposed. Real gas turbine combustors are typically characterized by much more complex geometries than bluff-bodies. Apart from stability issues, operation flexibility, efficiency and fuel flexibility need also to be addressed, especially when dealing with alternative fuel gas mixtures. One of the purposes of this work was also to design a burner that can, experimentally and numerically address some of these issues. The burner should be similar to a modern gas turbine burners, downscaled and experimentally feasible, yet possessing all of the complex interactions between fundamental combustion phenomenon and fluid mechanics of an industrial gas turbine combustor. This was done by using advanced computational tools in conjunction with CAD tools for identifying the operating limits of such a burner. Further, several experimental set-ups were re-designed for operation under various conditions. Throughout the thesis, LES-based models showed capabilities of predicting flames under stable and unstable conditions. RANS-based models were proved to be useful for design purposes. It was shown how POD, DMD and wavelets can be used for not just identifying important flame-flow features but also exploring the flow-flame interaction...|$|R
40|$|The ram jet is {{basically}} {{one of the}} most dimple types of aircraft engine. It consists only of an inlet diffuser, a combustion system, and an exit nozzle. A typical <b>ram-jet</b> configuration is shown in figure 128. The engine operates on the Brayton cycle, and ideal cycle efficiency depends only on the ratio of engine to ambient pressure. The increased, engine pressures are obtained by ram action alone, and for this reason the ram jet has zero thrust at zero speed. Therefore, ram-jet-powered aircraft must be boosted to flight speeds close to a Mach number of 1. 0 before appreciable thrust is generated by the engine. Since pressure increases are obtained by ram action alone, combustor-inlet pressures and temperatures are controlled by the flight speed, the ambient atmospheric condition, and by the efficiency of the inlet diffuser. These pressures and temperatures, as functions of flight speed and altitude, are shown in figure 129 for the NACA standard atmosphere and for practical values of diffuser efficiency. It can be seen that very wide ranges of combustor-inlet temperatures and pressures may be encountered over the ranges of flight velocity and altitude at which ram jets may be operated. Combustor-inlet temperatures from 500 degrees to 1500 degrees R and inlet pressures from 5 to 100 pounds per square inch absolute represent the approximate ranges of interest in current combustor development work. Since the ram jet has no moving parts in the combustor outlet, higher exhaust-gas temperatures than those used in current turbojets are permissible. Therefore, fuel-air ratios equivalent to maximum rates of air specific impulse or heat release can be used, and, for hydrocarbon fuels, this weight ratio is about 0. 070. Lower fuel-air ratios down to about 0. 015 may also be required to permit efficient cruise operation. This fuel-air-ratio range of 0. 015 to 0. 070 used in ram jets can be compared with the fuel-air ratios up to 0. 025 encountered in current turbojets. <b>Ram-jet</b> combustor-inlet velocities range from 150 to 400 feet per second. These high linear velocities combined with the relatively low pressure ratios obtainable in ram jets require that the pressure drop through the combustor be kept low to avoid excessive losses in cycle efficiency. It has been estimated that, for a long-range <b>ram-jet</b> engine, an increase in pressure loss of one dynamic head would require a compensating 1 -percent increase in combustion efficiency. Therefore, combustor pressure-loss coefficients (pressure drop/impact pressure) of the order of 1 to 4 are found in most current engines. The operating conditions described impose major problems in the design of stable and efficient <b>ram-jet</b> combustion systems. This chapter presents a survey of <b>ram-jet</b> combustor research and, where possible, points out criteria that may be useful in the design of <b>ram-jet</b> combustion systems...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method for}} evaluating the stability characteristics and the amplitude {{and the frequency of}} pulsation of <b>ram-jet</b> engines without heat addition is presented herein. Experimental verification of the theoretical results are included where data were available. Theory and experiment show that the pulsation amplitude of a high mass-flow-ratio diffuser having no cone surface flow separation increases with decreasing mass flow. The theoretical trends for changes in amplitude, frequency, and mean-pressure recovery with changes in plenum-chamber volume were experimentally confirmed. For perforated convergent-divergent-type diffusers, a stability hysteresis loop was predicted on the pressure-recovery mass-flow-ratio curve. At a given mean mass-flow ratio, the higher. value of mean pressure recovery corresponded to oscillatory flow in the diffuser while the lower branch was stable. This hysteresis has been observed experimentally. The theory indicates that for a <b>ram-jet</b> engine of given diameter, the amplitude of pulsation of a supersonic diffuser is increased by decreasing the relative size of the plenum chamber with respect to the diffuser volume down to a critical value at which oscillations cease. In the region of these critical values, the stable mass-flow range of the diffuser may be increased either by decreasing the combustion chamber volume or by increasing the length of the diffuser...|$|E
