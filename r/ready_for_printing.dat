25|$|Authors were {{increasingly}} expected to submit manuscripts in a standardised format and style. From 1896, they {{were encouraged to}} submit typed papers on foolscap-folio-sized paper to lighten the work of getting papers <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>printing,</b> and to reduce the chance of error in the process. A publishable paper now had to present its information in an appropriate manner, {{as well as being}} of remarkable scientific interest. For a brief period between 1907 and 1914, authors were under even more pressure to conform to the society's expectations, due to a decision to discuss cost estimates of candidate papers alongside referees' reports. The committees could require authors {{to reduce the number of}} illustrations or tables or, indeed, the overall length of the paper, as a condition of acceptance. It was hoped that this policy would reduce the still-rising costs of production, which had reached £1747 in 1906; but the effect appears to have been negligible, and the cost estimates ceased to be routine practice after 1914.|$|E

Most of Part I was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>printing</b> in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part II was added by his editors, Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush Rhees. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues that philosophical problems are bewitchments that arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called [...] "language gone on holiday." ...|$|E
60|$|As for my poem (far below Penini's), I work on {{steadily}} {{and have}} put in order and transcribed five books, containing in all above six thousand lines ready for the press. I have another book to put together and transcribe, and then must begin the composition part {{of one or two}} more books, I suppose. I must be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>printing</b> by the time we go to England, in June. Robert too is much occupied with 'Sordello,'[49] and we neither of us receive anybody till past four o'clock. I mean that when you have read my new book, you put away all my other poems or most of them, and know me only by the new. Oh, I am so anxious to make it good. I have put much of myself in it--I mean to say, of my soul, my thoughts, emotions, opinions; in other respects, there is not a personal line, of course. It's a sort of poetic art-novel. If it's a failure, there will be the comfort of having made a worthy effort, of having done it as well as I could. Write soon to me, and love us both constantly, as we do you.|$|E
60|$|About a {{month after}} the date of the last letter, Mr. and Mrs. Browning left Italy for the second time. As on the {{previous}} occasion (1851-2), their absence extended over two summers and a winter, the latter being spent in Paris, while portions of each summer were given up to visits to England. Each of them was bringing home an important work for publication, Mr. Browning's 'Men and Women,' containing much of his very greatest poetry, being passed through the press in 1855, while Mrs. Browning's 'Aurora Leigh,' although more than half of it had been written before she left Florence, was not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>printing</b> until the following year. They travelled direct from Florence to London, arriving there apparently in the course of July, and taking up their quarters at 13 Dorset Street. Their stay there was made memorable, as Mrs. Browning records below, by a visit from Tennyson, who read to them, on September 27, his new poem of 'Maud;' and it was while he was thus employed that Rossetti drew a well-known portrait of the Laureate in pen and ink. But in spite of glimpses of Tennyson, Ruskin, Carlyle, Kenyon, and other friends, the visit to England was, on the whole, a painful one to Mrs. Browning. Intercourse with her own family did not run smooth. One sister was living at too great a distance to see her; the other was kept out of her reach, for a considerable part of the time, by her father. In addition, a third member of the Barrett family, her brother Alfred, earned excommunication from his father's house by the unforgivable offence of matrimony. Altogether it was not without a certain feeling of relief that, in the middle of October, Mrs. Browning, with her husband and child, left England for Paris. The whole visit had been so crowded with work and social engagements as to leave little time for correspondence; and the letters for the period are consequently few and short.|$|E

When, however, Cardinal De Bissy required the monks of St.-Germain-des-Prés to sign a formula of submission he had drawn up, Bouquet and seven others refused their signature because De Bissy, being merely Abbot in commendam of St.-Germain-des-Prés, had no spiritual jurisdiction over the monks.|$|R

50|$|In Rush's account, the {{trustees}} met at Varick's house in July 1820 {{and decided to}} pursue the ordination of black ministers, allowing Zion to dispense with white ministers. Varick must have been coming to the fore in church affairs earlier than this, but his name does not appear on early documents. A general meeting of the church on August 11, 1820 resulted in two decisions: a refusal to join Allen and a refusal to return to white control. The problem of elders for the separate church now became crucial. On September 13, 1820, Abraham Thompson and James Varick were selected by the congregation to become elders {{and they began to}} act immediately, holding communion services.

50|$|The exhibition's {{organization}} was originally dedicated to two main categories: the cartoonists, and the readers. The {{aim of the}} exhibition was to show how a comic page is born, illuminating the processes by which pictures are drawn by hand before being photographed and downsized, <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>print.</b> The first exhibition, in 1972, showed the work of cartoonists from eight different countries. As with the 1973 show, no particular theme was selected for exhibition. However, the 1974 exhibition was given the subject of women in comics, as main characters and as authors. This show was an enormous success, drawing attention from the mass media. Special guests Oriana Fallaci and Natalia Aspesi wrote articles in their respective newspapers, and RAI (Italy's national public broadcasting company) reported on the exhibition on national television.|$|R

This allows them to reduce time and costs of delivering an accurate and quick classification of ancient pottery artifacts. To effectively reach such ambitious goal, the project has several sub-goals: (semi-) automatic digitalization of archaeological catalogs, a mobile app to be used on site for live classification of sherds with the generation of a complete potsherds identity card (<b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>print),</b> and an on-line database with real-time visualization of data.

2500|$|Grabar {{supervised}} another New York exhibition, {{this time}} of icon art, in 1931 and painted a string of official [...] "socialist realism epics" [...] {{but it was the}} 1933 Portrait of Svetlana that gave him an enormous and unwanted exposure at home and abroad. Grabar himself rated this portrait, painted in one day, among its best. The public identified its title subject as none other than Stalin's daughter (born in 1926, she could not have been Grabar's subject; the legend persisted into the 1960s). Either this dangerous publicity, or his earlier association with Natalia Sedova and other trotskyists compelled Grabar to retire to relative obscurity. He kept on painting and wrote his Autobiography that was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>print</b> in June 1935 but was barred from publication until March 1937. Contrary to the communist policy, Autobiography appreciated the [...] "formalist" [...] art of Mir Iskusstva and dismissed [...] "some critics applying Marxist analysis" [...] as utterly incompetent. In the same 1937 Grabar published Ilya Repin that earned him the State Prize four years later and began writing Serov. By 1940 he was firmly back into the Soviet establishment and was featured in propagandist newsreels produced for distribution in Nazi Germany.|$|R
