40|$|Abstract: As {{concrete-filled}} {{steel tube}} (CFST) is widely applied in practical engineering, {{it is also}} necessary to study its internal temperature in fire.

40|$|Wind {{comfort and}} wind safety for {{pedestrians}} are important requirements in urban areas. Many city authorities <b>request</b> <b>studies</b> of pedestrian wind comfort and wind safety for new buildings and new urban areas. These studies involve combining statistical meteorological data, aerodynamic information and criteria for wind comfort and wind safety. Detailed aerodynamic {{information can be}} obtained using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which offers considerable advantages compared to wind tunnel testing. However, the accuracy and reliability of CFD simulations can easily be compromised. For this reason, several sets of best practice guidelines have been developed in the past decades. Based on these guidelines, this paper presents a general simulation and decision framework {{for the evaluation of}} pedestrian wind comfort and wind safety in urban areas with CFD. As a case study, pedestrian wind comfort and safety at the campus of Eindhoven University of Technology are analysed. The turbulent wind flow pattern over the campus terrain is obtained by solving the 3 D steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with the realisable k–e model on an extensive high-resolution grid based on grid-convergence analysis. The simulation results are compared with long-term and short-term on-site wind speed measurements. Wind comfort and wind safety are assessed and potential design improvements are evaluated. The framework and the case study are intended to support and guide future studies of wind comfort and wind safety with CFD and, this way, to contribute to improved wind environmental quality in urban areas...|$|E
40|$|Communities with {{environmental}} health {{concerns in the}} USA frequently <b>request</b> <b>studies</b> from their local or state departments of public health. This paper presents findings from three focus groups conducted in communities north of Boston {{that have been the}} subject of two different environmental health studies. The focus groups were designed to elicit residents' perceptions of environmental health, and of the particular studies conducted in their communities. In all focus groups, participants had difficulty accepting the findings of health studies that contradicted their own experiences of environmental exposures and illness. Our results suggest that lay knowledge, informed in varying degrees by the experience of what we term "tangible evidence," creates a lens through which communities interpret a health study's findings. The differences in reliance on tangible evidence were related to participants' sense of trust in public officials, and the institutions responsible for conducting health studies. Participants from the wealthier, predominantly white communities discussed trust in study design and methodologies used. In contrast, participants from the lower-income, higher-minority communities assessed health studies with reference to their trust (or lack thereof) in study sponsors and public health institutions. Participants' experience of tangible evidence, trust or distrust in health agencies and research institutions, and a sense of relative community power, influence how they assess the findings of environmental health studies and may have implications for pubic health.

A partir do tema Descontinuidades na conversação: as reformulações na constituição do diálogo do chat esta pesquisa fundamenta-se, numa perspectiva sincrônica, na sondagem da interação por meio da linguagem produzida durante a interação mediada pelo computador. O corpus desta pesquisa consta de duas amostras documentadas a partir da sala temática denominada Problemas brasileiros na qual os interactantes, espontaneamente, dialogam por escrito. Investigamos alguns aspectos da comunicação mediada pelo computador com o intuito de corroborar com registros científicos que apontem algumas regularidades no processamento da interação síncrona que é realizada por meio de uma linguagem escrita com evidentes marcas da oralidade. Nesta pesquisa, apoiamo-nos teoricamente na tendência sociointeracionista dos estudos lingüísticos. Buscamos estudar o corpus extraído da Internet a partir da aplicação de teorias levantadas no conjunto das obras que envolvem a Análise da Conversação e que tratam da organização tópica e das estratégias de reformulação textuais utilizadas pelos falantes.
