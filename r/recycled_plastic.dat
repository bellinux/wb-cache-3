5|$|The Emeco 1006 (pronounced ten-oh-six), {{also known}} as the Navy chair, is an {{aluminum}} chair manufactured by Emeco. The 1006 was originally built for Navy warships during World War II, but later became a designer chair used in high-end restaurants and by interior designers. In the 1990s, the company began creating designer versions of the 1006 chair, such as the stackable Hudson chair and the 111 Navy Chair made from <b>recycled</b> <b>plastic.</b> Emeco also makes stools, tables, and other furniture. As of 2012, more than one million Emeco 1006 chairs have been produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} expanded {{rapidly in}} the 1940s because World WarII created a huge demand for inexpensive, mass-produced products. In 1946, American inventor James Watson Hendry built the first screw injection machine, which allowed much more precise control over the speed of injection {{and the quality of}} articles produced. This machine also allowed material to be mixed before injection, so that coloured or <b>recycled</b> <b>plastic</b> could be added to virgin material and mixed thoroughly before being injected. Today, screw injection machines account {{for the vast majority of}} all injection machines. In the 1970s, Hendry went on to develop the first gas-assisted injection moulding process, which permitted the production of complex, hollow articles that cooled quickly. This greatly improved design flexibility as well as the strength and finish of manufactured parts while reducing production time, cost, weight and waste.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{visitors}} at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from <b>recycled</b> <b>plastic</b> crosses the large sand dunes {{near the end of}} the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August because of the risk to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{conducted}} to measure a number of chemicals associated with informal e-waste recycling in the populations. One study enrolled children from Guiyu and a control site 50km away to measure blood lead levels (BLLs). The average BLL in Guiyu was 15.3ug/dL compared to 9.9ug/dL in the control site. In the United States, the CDC has set a reference level for blood lead at 5ug/dL. High levels of lead in young children can impact IQ and the development of the central nervous system. The highest concentrations of lead were found in the children of parents whose workshop dealt with circuit boards and the lowest was among those who <b>recycled</b> <b>plastic.</b>|$|E

25|$|Most {{polystyrene}} {{products are}} currently not recycled {{due to the}} lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. Due to the low density of polystyrene foam, it is not economical to collect. However, if the waste material goes through an initial compaction process, the material changes density from typically 30kg/m3 to 330kg/m3 and becomes a recyclable commodity of high value for producers of <b>recycled</b> <b>plastic</b> pellets. Expanded polystyrene scrap can be easily added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications; many manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap because of collection issues. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into products such as clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS. Currently, around 100 tonnes of EPS are recycled every month in the UK.|$|E

[...] Slezak also said that, [...] "the folks at 19 gave Kris the proper budget to kick off his video career – at least we finally know what the company did with the savings gleaned from hiring student filmmakers to helm Blake Lewis and Diana DeGarmo’s tragic first clips". James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the video looked better and more expensive that past-first videos by American Idol alumni under 19. Montgomery also compared the video's [...] "artfully color-saturated frames and great expanses" [...] to Snow Patrol's [...] "Run" [...] clip and the Madonna, Justin Timberlake, and Timbaland's [...] "4 Minutes", doing away with the [...] "narrative crutch most Idol champs' debuts lean on (see, for example, David Cook's 'Light On'), putting the focus squarely on Allen himself." [...] He also said that, [...] "while Allen's debut video isn't as flashy-dashy as Idol compatriot Adam Lambert's 'Time for Miracles,' it's just as good – mostly because, rather than rely on fiery explosions, 'Dying' plays it straight, showcasing Allen and his talents", and called it [...] "bold" [...] as Allen was never shown as the [...] "flashy type".|$|E

2500|$|One {{strategy}} enacted {{to reach}} this goal has been the placement of interactive recycling kiosks called [...] "Dream Machines" [...] in supermarkets, convenience stores, and gas stations, {{with the intent of}} increasing access to recycling receptacles. The use of resin to manufacture its plastic bottles has resulted in reduced packaging weight, which in turn reduces the volume of fossil fuels required to transport certain PepsiCo products. The weight of Aquafina bottles was reduced nearly 40 percent, to 15grams, with a packaging redesign in 2009. Also in that year, PepsiCo brand Naked Juice began production and distribution of the first 100 percent post-consumer <b>recycled</b> <b>plastic</b> bottle.|$|E
2500|$|The Energy Information Administration (EIA) {{states on}} its website that [...] "a paper mill uses 40 percent less energy to make paper from {{recycled}} paper {{than it does to}} make paper from fresh lumber." [...] Some critics argue that it takes more energy to produce recycled products than it does to dispose of them in traditional landfill methods, since the curbside collection of recyclables often requires a second waste truck. However, recycling proponents point out that a second timber or logging truck is eliminated when paper is collected for recycling, so the net energy consumption is the same. An Emergy life-cycle analysis on recycling revealed that fly ash, aluminum, recycled concrete aggregate, <b>recycled</b> <b>plastic,</b> and steel yield higher efficiency ratios, whereas the recycling of lumber generates the lowest recycle benefit ratio. Hence, the specific nature of the recycling process, the methods used to analyse the process, and the products involved affect the energy savings budgets.|$|E
40|$|Plastic {{recycling}} is a recovery process of waste plastics {{to make new}} products into different forms. Plastics are usually sorted based on their resin identification codes before the recycling and melting processes. Although the recycling rate of plastics is significantly high, properties and economical value of the <b>recycled</b> <b>plastics</b> are fairly low, which in turn limits the use of <b>recycled</b> <b>plastics</b> in the market. In the present study, high density polyethylene (HDPE) {{in the form of}} pellets was dissolved in toluene, and then nanoscale graphene inclusions at different loadings (e. g., 0 %, 0. 25 %, 0. 5 %, 1 %, 2 % and 4 %) were added into the polymeric solutions.

The injection molding process was conducted on the chopped <b>recycled</b> <b>plastics</b> associated with graphene loadings. The dielectric and electric properties of plastic nanocomposites were studied in detail.
