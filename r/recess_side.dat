40|$|We have {{developed}} a new technique of bilayer embedded SiGe epitaxy in order to suppress the degradation of short channel characteristics in PFETs. We {{have found that the}} SiGe growth rate near the <b>recess</b> <b>side</b> wall increased when using a high SiH 2 Cl 2 flow at high pressure. It enabled 1 st conformal undoped SiGe layer growth for the recess shape. For the 2 nd SiGe layer, we used an appropriate B 2 H 6 flow rate for good morphology. XAFS revealed that the 2 nd nearest neighbors of Ge became distorted when the incorporated amount of B increased. In addition, we developed a “Simultaneous condition switching technique " for forming bilayer embedded SiGe...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of a novel, non-contact smart card (1) is claimed. The electrically-insulating, flat card is made {{with at least one}} <b>recess(es)</b> on one <b>side.</b> Conductive track(s) are applied in a given pattern, {{on the surface of the}} <b>recessed</b> <b>side.</b> The track(s) are applied on surfaces both within and outside the recess(es). Microcircuit chip(s) (4) are aligned in the recess(es) and brought into contact with the track(s). Also claimed is a contact-less smart card, essentially as described. USE - Used to make a contact-less smart card with potentially extremely wide application in private and public life. ADVANTAGE - The process manufactures non-contact smart cards, producing the coils especially, at low cost. Resistance to mechanical stress and reliability are good. Single stage processes are employed where possible. Hot Stamp coil application is particularly economic and adhesive on the coil underside completes attachment. High production rates are achieved. The coil transfers data and/or e nergy, acting as an antenna. Of various applicable mounting technologies, the flip-chip method is particularly compact. Contact bumps are conveniently and accurately formed and registered during the earlier hot-stamping stage. Hermetic sealing using glob top technology, increases the reliable life of the card...|$|R
50|$|The Shelburne Free Library {{stands in}} the small village of Shelburne Center, just south of Massachusetts Route 2 {{on the east side}} of Shelburne Center Road. It is a roughly square 1-1/2 story gable-roofed stone structure, built of local stone laid in an uncourse mortared manner. Its main facade is symmetrical, with the main {{entrance}} set in a segmented-arch <b>recess</b> whose <b>side</b> and end walls are paneled. Flanking this <b>recess</b> on either <b>side</b> are narrow rectangular windows. The gable rises to a level slightly above that of the main roof, and has small buttresses at the ends. The side walls each have three windows. A single-story addition, built out of similar materials, projects southward from the rear corner.|$|R
50|$|The {{house at}} Kleče no. 22 {{was a large}} two-story {{structure}} with a symmetrical double-pitched roof. The year 1895 was carved above the entrance, which was somewhat <b>recessed.</b> The <b>side</b> facing the yard had a partial ground-floor arcade, and the structure once served as the Urh Inn (gostilna pri Urhu).

40|$|Future {{hypersonic}} {{vehicles will}} require high temperature, dynamic seals in advanced ramjet/scramjet engines {{and on the}} vehicle airframe to seal the perimeters of movable panels, flaps, and doors. Seal temperatures in these locations can exceed 2000 F, especially when the seals are in contact with hot ceramic matrix composite sealing surfaces. NASA Glenn Research Center is developing advanced ceramic wafer seals {{to meet the needs}} of these applications. High temperature scrub tests performed between silicon nitride wafers and carbon-silicon carbide rub surfaces revealed high friction forces and evidence of material transfer from the rub surfaces to the wafer seals. Stickage between adjacent wafers was also observed after testing. Several design changes to the wafer seals were evaluated as possible solutions to these concerns. Wafers with <b>recessed</b> <b>sides</b> were evaluated as a potential means of reducing friction between adjacent wafers. Alternative wafer materials are also being considered as a means of reducing friction between the seals and their sealing surfaces and because the baseline silicon nitride wafer material (AS 800) is no longer commercially available...|$|R
50|$|Nathaniel passed {{property}} at Leyton (comprising a capital message and 29 acres) to Fisher Tench {{and his wife}} Elizabeth in 1697. He inherited {{the rest of his}} father's estate in 1710, and probably soon after began to build the Great House at Leyton. It was a large mansion of two storeys, basement, and attics, built in the 'Wren' style of the period. The walls were of dark red brick with dressings of lighter brickwork and stone. The entrance front faced the high road and consisted of a central block flanked by lower and slightly <b>recessed</b> <b>side</b> wings. The main block had full-height Corinthian pilasters and a central pediment, while the wings had rusticated stone quoins. The whole façade, of thirteen bays, was surmounted by a modillion cornice, a panelled parapet, and hipped roofs with dormer-windows; six large stone vases broke the line of the parapet. The garden front was of similar size and character. The cupola from the house (demolished in 1905) is now on the tower of St. Mary's church.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{research}} is the concentration of stresses in a plate that has two <b>side</b> <b>recesses,</b> if the plate is exposed to the pre-set surface stress. Boundary integral equations are derived {{on the basis of}} the reciprocity theorem. The fundamental Kelvin solution is used to define the displacement area in the finite isotropic elastic plane. The mathematical model and the solution algorithm, both developed by the author, represent a numerical solution designated for the plate that has two <b>side</b> <b>recesses.</b> Comparison of results with well-known solutions demonstrates their good convergence. The author has discovered that the smaller the radius of the recess, the higher the stress concentratio...|$|R
5000|$|For 1970, the Cougar {{appearance}} {{was similar to}} the 1969 model, but changes were made. A new front end featured a pronounced center hood extension and electric shaver grille similar to the 1967 and 1968 Cougars. Federally mandated locking steering columns appeared inside, and high-backed bucket seats, similar to those included in the 1969 Eliminator package, became standard on all Cougars. Other changes included revised tail light bezels, new front bumper and front fender extensions, and larger, <b>recessed</b> <b>side</b> markers. The [...] 351 [...] "Cleveland" [...] V8 was now available for the first time, though both the Cleveland and Windsor engines were available as the base model two-barrel engine. The 390 FE engine was now dropped, and the Boss 302 and 428CJ continued. The Eliminator received with new striping, revised colors, and the four-barrel 351 Cleveland replacing the four-barrel 351 Windsor as the standard engine. The upgraded [...] "Décor" [...] interior and styled steel wheels, standard '69 Eliminator equipment, were moved to the options list for the 1970 Eliminator. No Eliminator convertibles were factory produced in either 1969 or 1970. New options for the 1970 Cougar were interior upholstery and vinyl top in bold houndstooth check patterns.|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} {{is a rare}} example of a nineteenth-century Greek Revival auditorium. It was designed by the noted English-born Kentucky architect Thomas Lewinski, while he worked as supervisor {{of the construction of}} a nearby Marine Hospital. The Greek Revival style building resembles Lewinski's work in Kentucky more so than the Greek Revival mansions of Natchez. The courthouse is rectangular in plan with two stories and a gabled roof. A primary Greek Revival feature is its symmetrical, three-bay facade, classically detailed with a centered, single bay engaged portico flanked by <b>recessed</b> <b>side</b> bays. The engaged portico features paired pilasters supporting a triple banded architrave, a wide frieze, a molded cornice, and a pediment. A molded panel parapet surmounts the facade with paired piers that echo the arrangement of the pilasters below them. The wide frieze continues along either side of the building, which is brick clad and has six window bays along its lower levels. The upper levels of the building contain larger wood windows. The second story above the main entrance contains a more elaborate double-height window with multi-light sidelights. The rear elevation has a central portico with pilasters rendered in brick. It has a modern stairwell addition enclosed in semi-opaque glass, constructed as part of the building's recent renovation. The front elevation on Pearl Street includes its original ornamental wrought iron fence and two decorative pole light fixtures, recreated based upon original documentation.|$|R
