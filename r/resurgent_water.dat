25|$|The upper {{sandstone}} {{member is}} known as the Big Clifty Sandstone: thin, sparse layers of limestone interspersed within the sandstones give rise to an epikarstic zone, in which tiny conduits (cave passages too small to enter) are dissolved by the natural acidity of groundwater. The epikarstic zone concentrates local flows of runoff into high-elevation springs which emerge at the edges of ridges. The <b>resurgent</b> <b>water</b> from these springs typically flows briefly on the surface before sinking underground again at elevation of the contact between the sandstone caprock and the underlying massive limestones. It is in these underlying massive limestone layers that the human-explorable caves of the region have naturally developed.|$|E
50|$|It {{supplies}} overall {{clean water}} and <b>resurgent</b> <b>water</b> for experiments and sewage. There are 30 water treatment receiving tanks, and processing units on the 1st and 2nd floor. The gross floor area is 2,043 ㎡, and the building area is 1822 ㎡, designed by Kyushu University facilities department, design for execution is Wesko and constructed by Tokukura Corporation, Wesco Corporation, Beppu Dengyo, and Sanwa shokai.|$|E

5|$|The caves {{have been}} used by humans for around 45,000 years, {{demonstrated}} by the discovery of tools from the Palaeolithic period, along with fossilised animal remains. Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain. A corn-grinding mill operated on the <b>resurgent</b> <b>waters</b> of the River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086. The waters of the river are used in a handmade paper mill, the oldest extant in Britain, which began operations circa 1610. The low, constant temperature of the caves means that they can be used for maturing Cheddar cheese.|$|R

Vertical fingers of frozen drained water. A basal crust <b>resurgent</b> from melt <b>water</b> ponding above a substrate and freezes. A glaze of ice on the snow surface, resulting from freezing rain on snow. A sun crust from melt water at the surface snow refreezes at the surface due to radiative cooling.|$|R
40|$|Floating {{treatment}} wetlands are innovative {{systems and}} their processes are still scarcely known within the {{traditional methods of}} phytodepuration. To gain initial information on their performance and potential in removing pollutants two experiments have been conducted in north-east Italy, in a Natural Park with <b>resurgent</b> <b>water.</b> Barriers formed by a new patented floating element were tested in real climatic and water flow conditions. One experiment was conducted in a channel receiving aquaculture effluents, while the other was set in two cleaner channels to test two installation designs (two barriers composed of two lines of elements - 2 X 2 design- and two composed of three lines of elements - 2 x 3 design-). Different macrophyte species were used (Phragmites australis, Carex elata, Juncus effusus, Typha latifolia, Chrysopogon zizanioides, Sparganium erectum, Dactylis glomerata). The floating systems were easily installed and required few maintenance operations. Native plants grew successfully, developing roots 90 - 135 cm deep one year after planting. Conversely, Chrysopogon zizanioides showed scarce adaptation to local conditions. In the first experiment median chemical oxygen demand (COD) in water passing through the floating wetland system was reduced by 66...|$|E
