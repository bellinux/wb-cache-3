5|$|Historian Steven Boyd {{argued that}} the {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion prompted anti-Federalist westerners to finally accept the Constitution and to seek change by voting for Republicans rather than <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> government. Federalists, for their part, came to accept the public's role in governance and no longer challenged the freedom of assembly and the right to petition.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, {{when the}} Spanish {{colonisation}} {{in the area}} began, El Hatillo was inhabited by the Mariches, an indigenous people possibly related to the Kalina (Caribs). Cacique Tamanaco {{was the leader of}} these tribes, known for <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> Spanish colonisation. As the colonisation developed, the indigenous inhabitants were killed; by order of Caracas's founder Diego de Losada, Tamanaco was also murdered.|$|E

5|$|Malta was {{invaded by}} the French First Republic in June 1798, and the Order was {{expelled}} from the island, resulting in the French occupation of Malta. Grand Master Hompesch was pressured to capitulate, as the Maltese nobility and the Magistrate of the Castellania, together with influential and high ranking figures {{made it clear to}} the Fiscal of the Castellania that, unless he surrenders, those <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> French would have to simultaneously face an internal revolution.

It {{attacked}} the Soviet bridgehead over the Vistula River near Baranów Sandomierski. On the road to Oględów, three Tiger IIs were destroyed in an ambush by a few T-34-85s. Because these German tanks suffered ammunition explosions, which caused many crew fatalities, main gun rounds were no longer allowed to be stowed within the turret, reducing capacity to 68. Up to fourteen Tiger IIs of the 501st {{were lost in the}} area between 12 and 13 August to ambushes and flank attacks by Soviet T-34-85 and IS-2 tanks, and ISU-122 assault guns in inconvenient sandy terrain.|$|E
5|$|Recognized as the {{principal}} chief of the Lake Superior Chippewa (Ojibwa) for nearly a half-century {{until his death in}} 1855, he led his nation into a treaty relationship with the United States Government.

5|$|The Dark Tower reveals more of Flagg’s background, {{relating}} that he {{was born}} Walter Padick in Delain to Sam the Miller of Eastar’d Barony. At age 13 Walter set out for a life on the road, but was raped by a fellow wanderer; author Bev Vincent hypothesized in The Road to the Dark Tower that Flagg's later actions towards Delain in The Eyes of the Dragon may have been revenge for the abuse he suffered as a child. <b>Resisting</b> <b>the</b> temptation to crawl back home, Padick instead moves towards his destiny; he learns various forms of magic, achieving a quasi-immortality. After centuries of wreaking havoc Flagg attracts {{the attention of the}} Crimson King, who adopts him as his emissary.|$|E
5|$|The ballet {{has been}} {{variously}} interpreted and adapted. The 1917 Russian film The Dying Swan by director Yevgeni Bauer, for example, {{tells the story}} of an artist who strangles a ballerina. Maya Plisetskaya re-interpreted the swan simply as elderly and stubbornly <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> effects of aging, much like herself. Eventually the piece came to be considered one of Pavlova's trademarks. More recently, Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo perform a parody version that emphasizes every excess dormant in the choreography, and, in 2000, street theatre artist Judith Lanigan created a hula hoop act based on the Fokine/Pavlova ballet divertissement that has been performed at international street theatre festivals, comedy and burlesque events, and in traditional and contemporary-style circuses.|$|E
5|$|Vortigaunts are {{a fictional}} extra-dimensional {{species in the}} Half-Life series of video games by Valve Corporation. In Half-Life and its three expansions, Vortigaunts are {{frequently}} encountered by the player as hostile non-player characters in Half-Life and later as allies in Half-Life 2. The Vortigaunts are depicted in Half-Life as being an enslaved race in an alternative dimension called Xen, subservient to a large creature called the Nihilanth, which itself is a slave to undisclosed masters. In Half-Life 2, the Vortigaunts have broken free of their slavery, and actively assist the player and other humans in <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> Combine occupation of Earth.|$|E

5|$|After his {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal more {{actively}} with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the Rasen-Shuriken attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to the point where he begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in his path.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Lindwall and his {{elder brother}} Jack were spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground {{on the second day}} of the First Test of the 1932–33 Ashes series. The series saw the usage of the notorious Bodyline tactics by England's pace battery led by Harold Larwood under the {{captaincy}} of Douglas Jardine. Larwood, a small man like Lindwall, was less than six feet and intimidated opposition batsmen with express pace bowling, aiming short pitched bouncers at their upper body. Larwood also had a smooth, rhythmic run-up and a classical side-on action, something for which Lindwall became famous. The match was also remembered for Stan McCabe's much-celebrated 187 not out, aggressively <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> Bodyline tactics as Australia fell to a heavy ten wicket defeat.|$|E
5|$|Australia batted first after Hassett won the toss, and {{the opening}} pair of Brown and Morris put on 139. Brown scored his third century in succession, before being out lbw to Indian Test player Abdul Hafeez Kardar for 108. Morris, Loxton, McCool and Ring all reached 50 as the Australians posted 431. Oxford's best batting {{performance}} {{came in the form}} of a 75-run partnership between Geoffrey Keighley and Kardar in their first innings, <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> spin bowlers on the dry wicket. Despite Kardar's innings of 54 and 29, the top-score in both innings, Australia won by an innings and 90 runs as wickets fell steadily. The wickets were spread evenly among the tourists; Toshack took three in each innings, while Johnston and McCool totalled four for the match.|$|E

5|$|Barley evidently {{decided that}} it was futile to {{continue}} <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> Stationers' Company, and on 15 May 1605, he successfully petitioned the Drapers' Company for a transfer to the Stationers' Company. On 25 June 1606, the Stationers' Company admitted him as a member. That same day, the Company's court, which had the authority to resolve disputes between members, negotiated a settlement in a lawsuit Barley had brought against East concerning the copyrights on certain music books. East claimed that since he had lawfully entered the books into the Company's register, the rights of the works belonged to him. Barley disagreed, claiming that the works were his through his partnership with Morley, who had held the royal music patent. The court's compromise settlement recognised the rights of both, stipulating that if East were to print an edition of any of the books in question, he was to acknowledge Barley's name on the imprint, pay Barley 20 shillings, and supply him with six free copies. On the other hand, Barley could not publish any of the books without the consent of East or his wife.|$|E
5|$|By 1929, {{several of}} the {{children}} were approaching the age to attend university and the family sought to move somewhere of a more congenial educational climate than Spain. That September, they moved to the Belgian village of Steenokkerzeel near Brussels, where they were closer to several members of their family. Zita continued her political lobbying on behalf of the Habsburg family, even sounding out links with Mussolini's Italy. There was even a possibility of a Habsburg restoration under the Austrian Chancellors Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg, with Crown Prince Otto visiting Austria numerous times. These overtures were abruptly ended by the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. As exiles, the Habsburg family took the lead in <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> Nazis in Austria, but this foundered because of opposition between monarchists and socialists.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{continued}} his independence from his party throughout his term, vocally opposing Republican {{plans to cut}} taxes despite record national budget deficits and <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> party's efforts to reduce funding for the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe {{in the aftermath of}} the war. He worked with fellow Kentuckian Alben Barkley and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse to undermine Jim Crow laws enacted by the states and remove obstacles to suffrage for minorities. He also co-sponsored a bill to create the Medicare system, although it was defeated at the time. Although he had voted with the Republicans just 51% of the time during his partial term– the lowest average of any member of the party– Cooper headed the Kentucky delegation to the 1948 Republican National Convention. He supported Arthur Vandenberg for president, but Thomas E. Dewey ultimately received the party's nomination. Cooper himself was mentioned as a possible candidate for vice-president, but ultimately did not receive the nomination and sought re-election to his Senate seat instead. Also in 1948, Centre College awarded Cooper an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.|$|E

5|$|Denis Compton hit a {{cautious}} 62, but Middlesex lost wickets regularly {{to fall from}} 1/78 to 203 all out. Five bowlers shared the wickets, Johnston and Loxton taking three apiece. At one stage, Australia were 53/3, but Morris (109) and Loxton (123) put on a partnership of 172. No other batsman bettered Hamence's 30, and Jim Sims took 6/65 as the Australians collapsed and lost their last six wickets for 46.

5|$|During a {{geological}} survey on Surata IV, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) {{is struck by}} a thorn growing on a motile vine plant. The away team immediately beams back to the Enterprise, where Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) finds out that the thorn has released a deadly virus into Riker's body. Within a matter of hours, the virus will reach Riker's brain, killing him. To try to save Riker's life, Pulaski puts him into a machine that will artificially stimulate his brain neurons, keeping them active and <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> virus. This causes Riker to dream of his past adventures aboard the Enterprise. Riker's first dreams are of reasonably neutral occasions, such as {{his first meeting with}} Lieutenant Commander Data (Brent Spiner).

5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28 with the score at 64, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes. On 39, Compton aimed a hard cut shot from Johnston's bowling, which flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip. Hutton managed to continue <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> Australians before Miller struck Crapp {{in the head with}} a bouncer. Hutton then edged Miller to Tallon and was out for 64, having top-scored in both innings. He had batted for over four hours and left England at 153/4. Thereafter, England collapsed. Crapp was bowled by Miller for nine, and two runs later, Ring dismissed debutant Watkins for two to take his only wicket. Lindwall returned and bowled Evans for eight. Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall's yorker in the fading light, and the umpires called off play due to bad light. The ground was then hit by rain, resulting in a premature end to the day's play. England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178/7.|$|E
