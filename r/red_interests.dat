He then undertook graduate studies with William ‘Cap’ Weston at Harvard, resulting in his PhD in 1939. After Harvard Red left to study plant biology with John Bonner at the California Institute of Technology. The collaboration didn’t work out {{and he ended up}} studying what he called ‘hormone A’ from Achlya with Dr. A. J. Haagen-Smit. His first brief professor appointment at Indiana University was interrupted by his call to the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee where he pioneered studies on the effects of Beta rays on rats. After working at Oak Ridge he took a position at the University of Chicago where he resumed efforts to determine the numbers and distributions of mating types from globally distributed fungi. One focus of his work was Schizophyllum commune. He returned to Harvard in 1954 where he chaired the Department of Biological Sciences and continued his research and mentorship of graduate students.|$|R

5000|$|A {{series of}} {{seemingly}} unconnected murder-suicides are attributed by Red {{to a life}} insurance claims adjuster named Milton Bobbit (Damian Young), {{who is able to}} convince terminally ill people to carry out the acts in exchange for financial rewards for their surviving family members. The targets of the murders are ultimately discovered to all be part of a clinical drug trial for Type 2 Diabetes that caused people to die, and Bobbit himself is found to be terminal. Elizabeth, Ressler and the team must catch up with Bobbit before he himself takes out the next victim: the doctor who headed up the trial. They manage to arrest the doctor and let Bobbit commit suicide. In Cooper's office, Red has a look at Bobbit's client list which seems to matter much to him. Meanwhile, Tom proposes that he and Elizabeth renew their marriage vows, given all they've been through, and has his brother Craig (Peter Scanavino) officiate the ceremony. Craig pulls Tom aside and says he's certain Elizabeth knows the truth about him, but Tom isn't convinced. In their new safe house, Elizabeth demands answers from Red regarding Tom as well as <b>Red's</b> <b>interest</b> in her, but all Red will say is that he's watched her closely ever since Tom came into her life. After Red gets some DNA results on Tom, he determines that Craig (real name [...] "Christopher") is not Tom's brother. Elizabeth traps Chris in his hotel room and tries to get answers. Tom calls Chris while Elizabeth, Red and Dembe are in the room, and mentions [...] "Berlin". Red demands to know what's in Berlin, but a frightened-looking Chris says he cannot say anything. After Red threatens that he'll {{find a way to make}} him talk, Chris hurls himself through the hotel room's window, falling to his death, after which Tom attempts to convince Liz that Craig had to fly home. Elizabeth has her own hideout where she watches surveillance footage of her and Tom which Red gave her. With that, she finds a hidden key.|$|R
5000|$|After a {{politician}} in Prague is framed for a murder, Red suspects it's {{the work of}} The Kingmaker (guest star Linus Roache) - a strategist behind the rise {{of some of the}} world's most powerful politicians. Red is seen meeting with an ally about the Prague matter, and the man tells him that the recent news of a siege on <b>Red's</b> <b>interests</b> is causing several key people to start distancing themselves. Elizabeth views the photos that Tom had led her to, which show Red at the hospital where her adoptive father Sam had died. She confronts Red about it, but he steers her toward the more urgent matter of The Kingmaker being in the U.S. Elizabeth and the team are able to uncover a plot by The Kingmaker to run the car of a New York Congressman off a bridge, attempting to make him look like a hero by saving his family. This puts him {{in the best position to}} win a special election for a Senate seat, which The Kingmaker vacates by killing the Senator. Alarms go off in the home where the murder is committed, with Ressler and Liz entering the home. The Kingmaker attacks Elizabeth and applies a choke hold, before being fatally shot by Ressler. Red meets with Fitch, telling him his businesses are under attack and suggesting it's a mutual problem, and proposes that they cooperate against their common enemy. Fitch meets with members of his global alliance, then tells Red they have chosen not to ally themselves with him, despite Red's threats to expose them. Elizabeth phones Red to inform him about The Kingmaker. Red says he wants 10 minutes with the man to find out who ordered the Prague incident, but Liz has to tell him that The Kingmaker is dead. Elizabeth then visits Red about her adoptive father, with Red finally admitting he killed Sam. Elizabeth calls Red a [...] "monster", and says the two of them are through.|$|R

Using individual data from the Italian SHIW, we find that older and more educated individuals display a greater attitude to cooperation, a higher interest in politics, and a more intense association activity. In contrast, the likelihood to rely on blood ties and personal knowledge {{does not depend on}} age and education. We also find that homeownership is more often than not associated with good social conduct, while urban residence has a negative impact on public behavior. Finally, having a Left political opinion increases the propensity to cooperate and the interest in politics, while it does not affect the likelihood to make use of blood ties and personal knowledge in the job market or vis-à-vis the bureaucracy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of a natural androgen, 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione (11 betaOHA 4), on sex-reversed fry of the Florida red tilapia. In a first approach, the optimal dosage and {{duration}} were determined in the laboratory. The sex-reversal treatment was applied on post-yolksac stage fry (10 days after fertilisation at 27 degreesC. Dosages of 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg of 11 betaOHA 4 kg(- 1) of food were used during periods ranging from 10 to 35 days. Dosages of 40 or 50 mg of 11 betaOHA 4 kg(- 1) of food during 21 - 35 days significantly increased the male percentage in sex-reversed groups in comparison to control groups. A lower but still significant deviation of the male percentage was observed when a dosage of 40 mg kg- 1 was given during at least 28 days. Lower dosages did not significantly affect the sex ratio of treated groups. Based on the results of these observations, a follow-up study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of this natural androgen for an intensive production of sex-reversed fry. Optimal dosage (50 mg kg- 1) and treatment duration (28 days) were applied to increasing stocking density of fry (8000 - 11, 000 fish m(- 2)), producing a mean male percentage of 99. 1 % on the 510, 000 treated fry.

40|$|Lobbyists {{are working}} in an {{ambivalent}} atmosphere. In Brussels, lobbying is an activity occupying about 20 000 people on a daily basis. They are trying to influence the legislative outcomes {{from the work of}} the about 15 000 politicians and employees of the EU institutions (Coen 2007). On one hand the lobbyists are wanted and needed by the politicians and their civil servants. Previous research tells about the lobbyists as the “merchants of information” (Milbrath 1960) providing resources to an understaffed EU-adminstration. Pieczka also points to that the lobbyists are providing the politicians with knowledge: “… the key resource – political influence – consisting of knowledge of the political processes and personalities as well as an ability to read the prevailing political climate, policy initiatives, and {{the ebb and flow of}} power through political networks” (Pieczka 2006 : 325). On the other hand, the lobbyists’ legitimacy is under a continous discussion regarding ominousity, unfair play and even bribing to achieve wished outcomes of the legislative work (see for example Moloney 2007). Since a few years lobbyists in Brussels need (in theory it is voluntary) to register and account for their lobbying budgets. With the inspiration of Goffman studying the moments and their men rather than the men and their moments (1967) this paper applies an interactional perspective on lobbying. Even though there are a lot of research made on lobbying in Brussels (see for example Beyer et al. 2010, Michalowitz 2007, Coen 2007, McGrath 2005 & 2009, Harris & Fleisher 2005) there is very few research exploring and analysing lobbying on a microlevel. This paper pulls lobbying research into the tradition within Media and Communication studies with ethnographic studies on practices and mechanisms steering these practices (for example Gaye Tuchman 1978). Following this perspective, the author has made seven weeks of participatory observations in Brussels. S/he has been shadowing lobbyists, MEP:s and their assistants and followed them in their daily work, one week per person. In addition about 40 interviews have been made. The results of the study show self-expectations and expectations from the interaction partner and how these expectations are negotiated and communicationed in the concrete meetings. The lobbyists are pursuing different strategies and tactics that are accounted for in the paper. ReferencesBeyers, J., Eising, R. & Maloney, W. A.

Nevertheless, its pharmacokinetic properties are less favorable, since the compound has poor bioavailability, low water solubility, and is chemically unstable. To overcome these problems, we developed two novel resveratrol nanodelivery systems based on lipid nanoparticles to enhance resveratrol&# 39;s oral bioavailability for further use in medicines, supplements, and nutraceuticals. Methods and materials: Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) loaded with resveratrol were successfully produced by a modified hot homogenization technique. These were completely characterized to evaluate {{the quality of the}} developed resveratrol-loaded nanoparticles. Results: Cryo-scanning electron microscopy morphology studies showed spherical and uniform nanoparticles with a smooth surface. An average resveratrol entrapment efficiency of ~ 70 % was obtained for both SLNs and NLCs. Dynamic light scattering measurements gave a Z-average of 150 &ndash; 250 nm, polydispersity index of ~ 0. 2, and a highly negative zeta potential of around &minus; 30 mV with no statistically significant differences in the presence of resveratrol. These characteristics remained unchanged for at least 2 months, suggesting good stability. Differential scanning calorimetry studies confirmed the solid state of the SLNs and NLCs at both room and body temperatures. The NLCs had a less ordered crystalline structure conferred by the inclusion of the liquid lipid, since they had lower values for phase transition temperature, melting enthalpy, and the recrystallization index. The presence of resveratrol induced a disorder in the crystal structure of the nanoparticles, suggesting a favoring of its entrapment. The in vitro release studies on conditions of storage showed a negligible resveratrol release over several hours for both nanosystems and the in vitro simulation of gastrointestinal transit showed that the resveratrol remained mostly associated with the lipid nanoparticles after their incubation in digestive fluids. Conclusion: Both nanodelivery systems can be considered suitable carriers for oral administration, conferring protection to the incorporated resveratrol and allowing a controlled release after uptake.

40|$|Properties of the {{nucleotide}} {{binding site}} of the Ca²⁺-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum have been investigated. The study centred around interaction of the high affinity ATP analog, 2 '- 3 '- 0 -(2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5 '-triphosphate, (TNP-ATP), with the Ca²⁺-ATPase. Defined fractions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), corresponding to the terminal cisternae (TC) and light SR (LSR), were isolated. The TC were shown to have distinctive morphological characteristics that differ from the LSR. The TC vesicles contained electron dense intravesicular material representative of Ca²⁺ binding proteins, and visible membranous "feet" structures, which are reported to interconnect with the transverse tubule. Functional characterisation of the isolated fractions provided evidence for the predominant localisation of Ca²⁺ release channels in TC, and concentration of Ca²⁺-ATPase molecules in LSR. These conclusions {{were based on the}} following observations: (a) decreased Ca²⁺ transport of TC versus LSR; ruthenium red, a Ca²⁺ channel blocker, enhanced Ca²⁺ transport and pumping efficiency in TC, (b) higher Ca²⁺-ATPase activity for LSR in the presence and absence of ionophore, (c) rapid Ca²⁺ efflux from TC which is inhibited by ruthenium <b>red.</b> Of special <b>interest</b> was the characterisation of the TC and LSR with respect to turnover-dependent TNP-ATP fluorescence. Fluorescence observed for TC was approximately 65 % of that for LSR. This phenomenon may be attributable to either the decreased Ca²⁺ ATPase content of the TC vesicles or open Ca²⁺ release channels. Hence the TNP-ATP fluorescence characteristics appear to reflect the morphological and functional subspecialisation of the defined SR fractions...|$|R
