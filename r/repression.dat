5|$|From 1993 to 1995 {{a presidential}} decree on {{measures}} {{to prevent future}} abuse of psychiatry was being drafted at the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political <b>Repression.</b> For this purpose, Anatoly Prokopenko selected suitable archival documents and, {{at the request of}} Vladimir Naumov, the head of research and publications at the Commission, Emmanuil Gushansky drew up the report. It correlated the archival data presented to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, to several strict-regime psychiatric hospitals (former Special Hospitals under MVD control). When the materials for discussion in the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political <b>Repression</b> were ready, however, the work came to a standstill. The documents failed to reach the head of the Commission Alexander Yakovlev.|$|E

5|$|State <b>repression</b> (including {{the infamous}} 1894 French lois scélérates) of the anarchist and labour {{movements}} following the few successful bombings and assassinations {{may have contributed}} to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state <b>repression,</b> in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.|$|E

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. While we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for <b>repression,</b> psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E

5|$|Expression of Hsp90A also {{correlates}} with disease prognosis. Increased levels of Hsp90A {{are found in}} leukemia, breast and pancreatic cancers {{as well as in}} patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In human T-cells, HSP90AA1 expression is increased by the cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13. HSP90, alongside other conserved chaperones and co-chaperones that interact to safeguard proteostasis, is repressed in aging human brains. This <b>repression</b> was found to be further exacerbated in the brains of patients with age-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease.|$|E
