The book is dedicated to Amartya Sen, whose influence can be seen in several places: for in-stance in the third chapter (Commerce and the State), which compares Turgot s, Condorcet s, and Smith s views on famines, and more generally in <b>Rothschild</b> <b>s</b> insistence that political economy cannot and should not be separated from ethics and politics. <b>Rothschild</b> <b>s</b> basic argument is that Smith and Condorcet proposed a comprehensive view of human life. The differences between the two are less important than their common allegiance to a liberal plan of equality, liberty and justice. ...|$|R

5000|$|Bio{{semiotics}} (from the Greek bios meaning [...] "life" [...] and semeion meaning [...] "sign") is a {{field of}} semiotics and biology that studies the production and interpretation of signs and codes in the biological realm. Biosemiotics attempts to integrate the findings of biology and semiotics and proposes a paradigmatic shift in the scientific view of life, demonstrating that semiosis (sign process, including meaning and interpretation) {{is one of its}} immanent and intrinsic features. The term biosemiotic was first used by Friedrich <b>S.</b> <b>Rothschild</b> in 1962, but Thomas Sebeok and Thure von Uexküll have implemented the term and field. The field, which challenges normative views of biology, is generally divided between theoretical and applied biosemiotics.|$|R

40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis is the Kurdish demand for {{federalism}} in Iraq. The research question is What have been the factors behind the Kurdish demand for a federal system in Iraq ? My focus is on two main factors, {{the internal and external}} (regional and international) factors. This is a qualitative case study. The focus is on why the Kurds chose to remain a part of Iraq, though there would seem to be few reasons for this desire. Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan/Southern Kurdistan have lived in a kind of independent mini-state since the Gulf War of 1991. They had developed good relationships with the outside world at the state level, although these relations were never recognized officially. The discussion also touches on the Kurds in other parts. This is because changes in any of the countries with Kurdish population (Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria) would {{have a significant impact on}} the Kurdish issue as a whole. The theoretical part are based on approaches from Lijphart s (1977) and Horowitz s (1985) mechanisms for conflict management and resolutions in divided societies, and from Lake and <b>Rothschild</b> <b>s</b> (ed. 1998) approach of confidence-building measures which includes power-sharing and federalism to keep internal conflicts at a local level and prevent it from spreading. The relationships that have developed after the fall of Ba ath regime indicate that the political system that is taking shape in Iraq will contain elements from both consociational, power-sharing and integrative approaches. The ethnic-religious conflict in Iraq has deep roots and there is a need for power-sharing at regional level, so that Kurds could run own regional affairs. On the other hand, it is necessary for the different groups to negotiate and cooperate in order to solve internal conflicts and future problems ahead in Iraq. The Kurdish issue bears an external dimension too. It is argued that federalism for Kurds seems to be a result of regional and international pressure, and that federalism is being applied to prevent the Kurdish conflict or the conflict in Iraq from escalating, and thereby maintain the geopolitical stability and balance of the region. The analytical part is divided into two, with the internal factors (chapter 4) and the external factors (chapter 5). Due to the internal situation, it would seem to be necessary for the Kurds to maintain their self-rule in a federal order, and also important to have a dialogue with Baghdad and participate in the political process and decision-making. In this way the Kurds could guarantee their future against possible discrimination, and at the same time, bring the Kurds a step further towards gaining control over territories. When it comes to the external factors, the argument is that the demand for federalism came as a result of external pressure on Kurdish decision-makers. The regional powers, especially countries with Kurdish population, have in the past rejected Kurdish demands and have in fact cooperated to prevent the Kurds from establishing autonomous regions. This is because success for Kurds in any neighboring country could awaken nationalistic movements among Kurds across the borders and thereby inspire them to come up with demands. At the international level, the United States seems to need the Kurds, who are struggling for a secular form of democracy in Iraq in order to maintain an internal balance of power, and probably prevent the Shiite majority s attempt to establish another Shiite regime there. Then, federalism with Kurdish regional self-rule satisfies the external powers and neighbors in the region, while the Kurdish population s desire for independency is ignored, again. I also have underlined that one should pay attention to external role regarding internal conflict management. And that the Kurdish conflict, which bears a strong external dimension, is a good example for further studies with similar cases...|$|R
40|$|Guillermo Calvo {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} economists in the field of international macroeconomics of the past 30 years. He has produced seminal articles in every area of macroeconomics and international economics that he has worked on, including his early classic articles on capacity utilization and time inconsistency, his 1980 s works on efficiency wages, price stickiness, and policy credibility, and his recent studies on sudden stops and emerging market crises. Yet, the defining feature of Guillermo Calvo s contribution to our profession is not the depth and wide scope of the economic theories he has developed, but the central emphasis he puts in all his work on the role of economics as a tool for understanding reality and improving the quality of human life. Guillermo Calvo s passion for the policy implications of economic theory is obvious to anyone who has met him since his days as Senior Advisor of the Research Department of the IMF in the mid- 1980 s. This feature of his professional interests was much less obvious to those who interacted with him during his early years as an important figure of the rational expectations revolution. It was probably hard to see that behind the highly technical treatment presented in his articles at that time was an author who had his feet soundly set on the ground and focused on understanding how society could benefit from the renaissance of macroeconomic theory that was taking place. Interestingly, Michael Rothschild did figure out the true nature of Guillermo Calvo in those early years. When the University of California at San Diego tried to hire Calvo in the mid- 1980 <b>s,</b> <b>Rothschild</b> explained to Calvo that he was an excellent fit for San Diego because he was a particular type of theoretician: Most theoreticians make theory out of theory, Rothschild noted, but Calvo was different because he made theory out of reality, taking what is really out there and presenting it in a much wider and complex form than a well-developed but narrow theory. The following pages are excerpts from three interview sessions that Guillermo Calvo and I had at his office in the Inter-American Development Bank in the spring of 2003. These interviews provide a clear summary picture of Calvo as the theoretician of reality that Michael Rothschild described. The recollection of the conversation with Rothschild is one of many fascinating memories of Calvo s personal life and professional career that emerged during our meetings. We taped and transcribed the three meetings in Spanish and then Calvo and I together edited that material to produce this much shorter interview in English for Macroeconomic Dynamics. ...|$|R
