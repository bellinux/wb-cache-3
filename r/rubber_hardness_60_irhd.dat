40|$|Abstract- Methods for {{hardness}} measurement on elastomers {{are characterized by}} a set-up where indenters with various defined geometries are pressed under defined test forces into the surface of testing material. The hardness value represents {{the resistance of the}} material to the rigid indenter and is calculated from the indentation depth of the indenter in the to be tested material. The test methods IRHD and Shore are the most common methods used in the field of <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> measurements. Appropriate hardness measuring instruments are spread world wide. A periodic verification has to be carried out to assure the accuracy of these measuring instruments. Direct and indirect verification methods are recommended to be used. For the indirect method <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> reference blocks are used. This indirect verification method is especially appropriate for the daily check of hand held <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> testers. On the other side the direct verification of test force, depth measuring system and indenter geometry is suited for the periodic calibration of <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> testers. For the <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> reference blocks their accurate hardness reference value and the long-term stability are the most important characteristics. In this paper the long-term behaviour of <b>hardness</b> of <b>rubber</b> blocks which at present are available on the market and are made by different producers is presented. For the measurements the Shore and IRHD hardness standard devices in the PTB have been used. In order to determine the relationship between hardness and time under the specified conditions a regression analysis of the obtained measurement results was carried out. The results of this analysis can be used for the improvement of quality assurance systems in the field of <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> measurements...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the failure {{probability}} of rubber sealing rings in reciprocating dynamic seal, a new structure of sealing ring based on bionics was designed. The biomimetic ring has three concave ridges and convex bulges on each side which are very similar to earthworms. Bulges were circularly designed and sealing performances of the biomimetic ring in both static seal and dynamic seal were simulated by FEM. In addition, effects of precompression, medium pressure, speed, friction coefficient, and material parameters on sealing performances were discussed. The results show that von Mises stress of the biomimetic sealing ring distributed symmetrically in no-pressure static sealing. The maximum von Mises stress appears on the second bulge of the inner side. High contact stress concentrates on left bulges. Von Mises stress distribution becomes uneven under medium pressure. Both von Mises stress and contact stress increase when precompression, medium pressure, and <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> increase in static sealing. Biomimetic ring can avoid rolling and distortion in reciprocating dynamic seal, and its working life is much longer than O-ring and rectangular ring.

The {{influence of the}} type and amount of diene on the UV stability was investigated. FTIR (ATR) measurements of the carbonyl absorbance after WOM aging were comparable with {{the outcome of the}} oxygen absorption tests. Both techniques showed a decrease in UV stability with increasing diene content. In addition, EPDM containing 5 -ethylidene- 2 -norbornene (ENB) as the third monomer showed a higher UV stability compared to EPDM containing dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) as the third monomer. Furthermore, a linear relation was found between the carbonyl absorbance after WOM aging and the third monomer content for DCPD- and ENB-containing EPDM samples with comparable ethylene/propylene (C 2 /C 3) ratio. The microhardness (International <b>Rubber</b> <b>Hardness</b> Degree) and the Young's modulus of the various EPDMs as function of the WOM irradiation time showed a maximum.

Current seal designs, consist of an Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) ring, energised to remain {{in contact with the}} reciprocating piston, using a nitrile rubber o-ring. The design of the seals is such that they do not facilitate the formation of a lubricating film, and the high contact stresses at the seal face due to the seal pressure cause excessive wear of the seals. The elastohydrodynamic model is based on a numerical algorithm in which the elasticity equations for the seal deflection and the one dimensional lubrication equation have been solved simultaneously. The polymeric ring has been simplified due to its axisymmetry, and modelled in cross section as an elastic beam resting on a spring base, while the deformation of the o-ring has been considered independently since the moduli of the two materials differs by nearly two orders of magnitude. The o-ring was modelled using the non-linear Mooney-Rivlin constitutive equation implemented in the finite element code ABAQUS. With this model, the contact stresses existing between the o-ring and the back of the polymer seal have been determined for a range of o-ring squeezes and <b>rubber</b> <b>hardnesses.</b> The resultant lubrication and o-ring forces acting on the rectangular polymer seal have been used in a finite difference formulation of the seal (or beam on a spring base) to determine the seal deflection above the piston...|$|R

40|$|Harsh winter {{conditions}} {{are known to}} be one of the most challenging environments for driving. Although the number of fatal accidents is higher during the summer compared to the winter in Norway (according to Norwegian Highways Authority), the total number of accidents is higher in the winter season. These accidents mainly happen due to loss traction on snowy or icy road surfaces. The loss of traction happens because there is not enough friction between the road surface and the car’s tyres. To date, tyre producing companies have focused on parameters such as <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness,</b> elasticity and the adding of spikes. However, these developments have not brought about a revolutionary change in road safety. This paper presents a way to improve the mechanical grip of the tyre in snow and icy conditions by altering the profile of the contact pressure between the tyres and the surface. To modify the contact pressure profile we are proposing to replace conventional air-filled tyres with airless tyres. This will allow the designer to modify the structure inside the tyres in such a way that it will provide a concentrated contact pressure profile. By doing this we can concentrate the forces due to the weight of the car directly down to the contact point instead of distributing them throughout the tyre contact area. This concentrated contact pressure will provide a larger stick region hence providing better traction performance. In this paper, we are proposing to conduct this design study using finite element method by ANSYS® Workbench...|$|R

Effects of stimulation with 100  ng/mL BMP- 4 /- 7 heterodimer or 10  mM lithium chloride (LiCl) on ECM-deposition was quantified and characterized histologically. Biomechanical parameters were determined by the Very Low <b>Rubber</b> <b>Hardness</b> (VLRH) method and under confined compression stress relaxation.
