This Article would grant Hong Kong's police force <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to private property {{on grounds of}} 'safeguarding national security', but without court warrants. Coupled with years of economic hardships and discontent of Tung's pro-Beijing stance, a mass demonstration broke out on 1 July 2003. This demonstration hastened the resignations of two government ministers and, eventually, that of Tung on 10 March 2005.|$|E

During the war, the Chamberlain family had commissioned historian Keith Feiling to produce an official biography, and gave him access to Chamberlain's private diaries and papers.

40|$|International audienceSome {{authors have}} linked the {{question}} of inequalities among pastoralists to <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to pastureland, but their analyses <b>of</b> pastoralists' <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> generally focused on the privatisation of pastureland. We reveal that {{a wider range of}} power relations between farmers and herders, local and national institutions affects pastoralists' <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to pastureland. We demonstrate that socio-economic inequalities among the Fulbe people are linked to the unequal capacity of pastoralists to manage territorialisation processes to their own advantage. Reciprocally, the entrenchment of the territories that results from these processes reifies inequalities between pastoralists. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The decision {{to build a new}} leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save The Car Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the car park open. The group said that the closure of the car park would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners' <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the car park. This decision was severely criticised in an internal audit report.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 2005, then-Chief of Defence Staff Rick Hillier {{signed an}} {{agreement}} between Canada's Department of National Defence and the Government of Afghanistan. The agreement did not include any explicit <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> by Canada to Afghan detainees. Members of the opposition requested then-Minister of National Defence Gordon O'Connor to renegotiate the prisoner transfer agreement. This request was dismissed, with O'Connor saying the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent fulfilled the duty of ensuring fair treatment of detainees and Canada could be notified and take action in any cases of abuse. However, the Red Cross stated that their mandate was being misunderstood, {{and it was the}} responsibility of Canada. It maintained that it had no role in monitoring the Canada-Afghanistan detainee-transfer agreement, and that following long-established operating procedure, the Red Cross would not reveal to any foreign government any abuses it might find in Afghan prisons. While maintaining that detainee monitoring was the Red Cross' duty until March 2007, O'Connor apologized to the House of Commons for previously misleading them on the issue. In turn, a new agreement was reached in April 2007 that allowed Canadian officials to have access to Kandahar jails.|$|E

30|$|The {{question}} of people-pasture relations, i.e. <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>access,</b> was long ignored {{because of a}} largely unquestioned assumption that such rights were extensive and communal. I questioned this at the 1975 Paris colloquium on Pastoral Production and Society (Équipe 1979) {{on the basis of}} my studies of Shahsevan nomads in Iran and Durrani in Afghanistan, and a key collection in Mobility and Territoriality (Casimir and Rao 1992) has since tackled the issue comparatively. Clearly, there is a very wide range of practices; in certain pastoral conditions, individuated <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>access,</b> rental and purchase do develop and flourish, but in most cases, different forms of communal, collective, seasonal/successional <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> are the rule.|$|R

25|$|Clark {{was unable}} to {{accomplish}} much in office because of the tenuous situation of his minority government. However, historians have credited Clark's government with making access to information legislation a priority. The Clark government introduced Bill C-15, the Freedom of Information Act, which established a broad <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to government records, an elaborate scheme of exemptions, and a two-stage review process. The legislation was debated at second reading {{at the end of}} November 1979 and was referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. Within days the minority Conservative government was unseated; the legislation died on the order paper. The re-elected Trudeau government subsequently based its Access to Information Act on the Clark government's Bill C-15. The Access to Information Act received royal assent in July 1982 and came into force in July 1983. The public now has the legal <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to government records in some 150 federal departments and agencies.|$|E

25|$|An {{estimated}} 110 {{million people}} visit {{the national parks}} of England and Wales each year. Recreation and tourism bring visitors and funds into the parks, to sustain their conservation efforts and support the local population through jobs and businesses. These visitors also bring problems, such as erosion and traffic congestion, and conflicts {{over the use of}} the parks' resources. Access to cultivated land is restricted to bridleways, public footpaths, and permissive paths, with most (but not all) uncultivated areas in England and Wales having <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> for walking under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E
25|$|The Western Wall {{is one of}} the holiest of Jewish sites, sacred {{because it}} is a remnant of the ancient wall that once {{enclosed}} the Jewish Second Temple. The Jews, through the practice of centuries, had established a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the Wailing Wall for the purposes of their devotions. As part of the Temple Mount the Western Wall was {{under the control of the}} Muslim religious trust, the Waqf. Muslims consider the wall to be part of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, and according to Islamic tradition the place where Muhammad tied his horse, Buraq, before his night journey to heaven. There had been a few serious incidents resulting from these differences.|$|E
25|$|Some make a {{distinction}} between language rights and linguistic human rights because the former concept covers a much wider scope. Thus, not all language rights are LHR, although all LHR are language rights. One way of distinguishing language rights from LHR is between what is necessary, and what is enrichment-oriented. Necessary rights, as in human rights, are those needed for basic needs and for living a dignified life, e.g. language-related identity, access to mother tongue(s), <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to an official language, no enforced language shift, access to formal primary education based on language, and the right for minority groups to perpetuate as a distinct group, with own languages. Enrichment rights are above basic needs, e.g. right to learn foreign languages.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{unrestricted}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the Internet, {{but it is}} unavailable in most places. The {{government does}} not interfere with academic or cultural activities, and generally respects the right to freedom of assembly, although it sometimes refuses permits for gatherings by opposition groups and others. In 2010, the government prohibited several public gatherings, including demonstrations by union members concerned about corruption and other issues. Benin's constitution and laws guarantee the right to move freely around the country, travel abroad, emigrate and repatriate, and these rights are generally honored, although there are checkpoints {{around the country that}} block movement and that are used by police and gendarmes to demand bribes. Although minors require documentation when traveling abroad in order to avoid trafficking, the uneven enforcement of this requirement results in continued trafficking.|$|E
25|$|For {{this reason}} {{the scope of}} implied {{licenses}} is strictly limited in New Zealand. The Supreme Court has said an implied license is unlikely to exist if {{the purpose of the}} entry was not to make a reasonable inquiry or if it cannot be assumed that the occupier would have consented to the police entering had they known the particular purpose for the entry. An implied license can extend to allow entry into a private premises in certain circumstances but this will be in the minority of cases and there will generally be no <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> even where, for example, the door to the premises is open. An implied license can be revoked by the occupier through a clear unequivocal revocation, further, the existence of gates or signs may amount to a physical revocation.|$|E
25|$|The {{mere fact}} that a {{decision-maker}} is conferred wide discretion by law is not reason enough for a weakening of the requirements of natural justice.

The Treasury had exercised powers to freeze the appellants' financial assets and economic resources {{on the ground that}} it reasonably suspected the appellants were or might be persons who had committed, attempted to commit, participated in or facilitated the commission of terrorism, pursuant to the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 made under the United Nations Act 1946. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that since the Al-Qaida Order made no provision for basic procedural fairness, it effectively deprived people designated under the order the fundamental <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to a judicial remedy and hence was ultra vires the power conferred by the United Nations Act 1946 for the making of the Order.|$|E
