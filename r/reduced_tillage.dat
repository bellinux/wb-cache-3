50|$|Desertification is an {{environmental}} process of ecosystem degradation in arid and semi-arid regions, often caused by human activity. It {{is a common}} misconception that droughts cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient and organic matter levels, <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> and increased cover. These practices help to control erosion and maintain productivity during periods when moisture is available. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands accelerates desertification.|$|E

50|$|Soil {{conservation}} - The {{nature of}} dryland farming makes it particularly susceptible to erosion, especially wind erosion. Some techniques for conserving soil moisture (such as frequent tillage to kill weeds) {{are at odds}} with techniques for conserving topsoil. Since healthy topsoil is critical to sustainable dryland agriculture, its preservation is generally considered the most important long-term goal of a dryland farming operation. Erosion control techniques such as windbreaks, <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> or no-till, spreading straw (or other mulch on particularly susceptible ground), and strip farming are used to minimize topsoil loss.|$|E
5000|$|Tilling may destroy crucial {{physical}} {{characteristics of a}} soil such as water suction, its ability to send moisture upwards, even during dry spells. The effect is due to pressure differences between soil areas. Furthermore, tilling most certainly destroys soil horizons and hence disrupts the established flow of nutrients. A study suggests that <b>reduced</b> <b>tillage</b> preserves the crop residues {{on the top of}} the soil, allowing organic matter to be formed more easily and hence increasing the total organic carbon and nitrogen when compared to conventional tillage. The increases in organic carbon and nitrogen increase aerobic, facultative anaerobic and anaerobic bacteria populations.|$|E

Both crops showed decreasing concentration of Zn within the plant tissue {{as a result of}} the soil tillage reduction in the order CT>DH>NT, presumably due to the limited roots growth in lesser disturbed soil at DHand NT treatments. Winter wheat recorded generally lower than optimal Zn concentrations and higher P:Zn ratios at <b>reduced</b> soil <b>tillage</b> treatments, as a result of lower Zn uptake.
