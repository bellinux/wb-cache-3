40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{rights of}} first refusal and rights of first offer in a multiple-buyer, sequential bargaining setting. A {{right of first refusal}} entitles the <b>right-holder</b> {{to purchase a}} subject asset on the same terms as those accepted by a third party. A right of first offer requires a seller to first offer the <b>right-holder</b> to buy a subject asset and prohibits the seller from subsequently selling the asset to a third party on better terms than those offered to the <b>right-holder.</b> We examine when and how such rights yield benefits to or impose costs on the <b>right-holder</b> and the seller. We show that a right of first refusal transfers value from other buyers to the <b>right-holder,</b> but may also force the seller to make suboptimal offers. A right of first offer induces the seller to lower his first-period offer, which will tend to increase the net surplus to the seller and <b>right-holder,</b> but also forces the seller to make suboptimal subsequent offers. We find conditions under which it is in the ex ante interest of the seller and the <b>right-holder</b> to contract for a right of first refusal or a right of first offer, respectively...|$|R

This latter objective is reflected, inter alia, in the requirements for the conversion of old-order mining rights to new-order rights and the requirements for applications for new mining rights. Holders of mineral and petroleum rights are required, furthermore, to demonstrate compliance with black economic empowerment on an annual basis.|$|E

5000|$|SADSTIA {{is governed}} by a {{constitution}} that was adopted on 24 March 1974 and updated on 12 September 2002 [...] This was {{in recognition of the}} fact that circumstances in South Africa and in the fishing industry changed considerably after 1994, the year of South Africa’s transition to democracy. In fact, the structure of the offshore demersal trawl fishery has changed substantially since 1994, in keeping with South African laws and guidelines on black economic empowerment. A study published by the independent empowerment research and rating agency, Empowerdex, in 2016 found that black shareholding is at least 62.36%. This is {{in stark contrast to the}} period pre-1990 when only a handful of companies held rights in the fishery - all of them large and predominantly white-owned. Today, there are 46 <b>right-holders</b> in the fishery. These may be broadly separated into three categories: smaller companies that supply the domestic market with minimally processed hake; medium-sized companies that operate as wholesalers, serving both domestic and international markets; and large companies with sophisticated, vertically integrated operations that process hake for local and international retail markets.|$|E
5000|$|According to Aoife Nolan, [...] "The limited {{consideration}} of children (and of children as <b>right‐holders,</b> specifically) in the 1937 Constitution is undoubtedly largely {{attributable to the}} contemporary societal perception of children as objects of parental rights and duties rather than autonomous right‐holders." [...] The Constitution's framing of family and education rights in Articles 40 to 44 reflected Catholic social teaching as in Quadragesimo anno. [...] Over the 1990s and 2000s, a political consensus developed in Ireland that children's rights needed to be strengthened in the Constitution to counterbalance family rights. [...] Numerous contemporary and historical cases {{of child abuse and}} neglect came to light, including many involving the Catholic Church. Reports, including that of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and another by Catherine McGuinness, found that state agencies' hesitancy to act was partly from fear that hasty intervention might violate the parental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. There were other controversial constitutional judgments in court cases involving minors: [...] "Baby Ann" [...] was placed for adoption by unmarried parents aged one week and returned to them after two years when they married, despite having bonded with foster parents in the interim; and a man found guilty underage sex, after his defence of mistaken age had been ruled inadmissible under strict liability, had his conviction overturned when the strict-liability provision was ruled unconstitutional.|$|E

40|$|A Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) to {{development}} has been adopted by numerous international NGOs, multilateral and bilateral agencies. In theory, the HRBA {{has the potential to}} dislodge inequalities and discrimination that perpetuate poverty. However, the implementation of the HRBA at the local level has been a challenge. This thesis is an examination of how the HRBA is operationalized at the local level by international NGOs and its actual impact on women s empowerment. In order to achieve this, a case of ActionAid s intervention on women s rights in Malawi s Rumphi district, was studied. Contrary to what an HRBA assumes, the study indicates a top-down approach during the implementation of the project. This shows that the HRBA as applied by AAM did not lead to a radical transformation of power relations among development actors namely: the donor, AAM staff, the RWF and the <b>right-holders.</b> This in turn limited the desired empowerment outcomes among the <b>right-holders.</b> The study established that there are many challenges that affect the implementation of the HRBA. These include low education levels among the <b>right-holders,</b> high poverty levels and lack of financial resources to implement a holistic approach. The study further indicates that the HRBA aided in filling the knowledge gap among women on various developmental issues. However, the study confirmed that such intangible benefits do not address the immediate needs of the <b>right-holders.</b> The study suggests that for effective poverty reduction, development actors must consider blending the HRBA with other approaches in order to address the immediate needs of the <b>right-holders...</b>|$|E
40|$|Copyright law grants {{exclusive}} rights to <b>right-holders</b> which prevent others from exploiting copyright-protected works without authorisation. However, this right is not absolute. Legislation includes specific exceptions which preclude <b>right-holders</b> from exercising their prerogatives in particular cases which foster creativity and cultural diversity within that society. The parody exception pertains to this ultimate objective by permitting users to reproduce copyright-protected materials {{for the purpose of}} parody. While the parody exception is not harmonised at international level, the EU Information Society Directive offers EU Member States the option of including a parody exception within national copyright legislation as part of a harmonising framework. The UK took advantage of this option, and introduced a new copyright exception for parody in October 2014. To understand the meaning and scope of the new exception in UK copyright law and to analyse whether EU harmonisation of the parody exception is achievable, this thesis examines and compares four jurisdictions which differ in their protection of parodies: France, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. This thesis is concerned with finding an appropriate balance between the protection afforded to <b>right-holders</b> and the public interest in encouraging parody. This is achieved by analysing the parody exception to the economic rights of <b>right-holders,</b> the application of moral rights and the interaction of the parody exception with contract law. As parodies constitute an artistic expression protected under the right to freedom of expression, this thesis considers the influence of freedom of expression on the interpretation of this specific copyright exception. Furthermore, this thesis aims to provide guidance on how to resolve conflicts where fundamental rights are in conflict...|$|E

40|$|As the United Nations {{advances}} {{towards a}} better understanding of what elements are central in ensuring that the development assistance it provides is effective and results in tangible changes for {{the lives of the people}} it seeks to assist, it has recently began to recognize the need to work in strengthening the capacity of <b>rights-holders</b> to demand their rights, as much as it works in strengthening the capacity of dutybearers to meet their obligations; a key notion in the human rightsbased approach to development the United Nations now promotes. 2 Yet, development assistance programmes, even at the United Nations, still overwhelmingly focus on the duty-bearer’s role, with fewer programmes devoted to working with <b>rights-holders.</b> The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights’ (OHCHR) results framework for 2012 – 2013 for example, devotes five of its technical assistance global objectives (or “expected accomplishments”) to duty-bearers, four to the international community’s role, and only two focused on <b>rights-holders.</b> 3 There are surely several reasons for this, but one element that I suspect contributes to this imbalance is the reduced number of experiences gathered in working with <b>rights-holders,</b> in comparison to the number of experiences gathered in working with duty-bearers; and the even fewer experiences, if we circumscribe our interest specifically to integrating Indigenous Peoples’ rights into development assistance programmes. 4 The present article seeks to describe one such experience, highlighting key elements that could be of use to other similar programmes, to promote greater attention to the potential this form of international assistance has in empowering Indigenous Peoples to claim their rights...|$|R
