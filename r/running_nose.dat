50|$|Irritations of the {{application}} site are very common. This includes redness, scaling, crusting, pain, pruritus, and sometimes infection.

5000|$|In board design, the [...] "{{stringer}}" [...] is a board's central {{plane of}} reflection, {{down the middle}} of its deck and its keel. In construction, the stringer can have no special parts, or can embed a stiff, thin, vertical slat, usually of wood but sometimes of carbon fiber, <b>running</b> from <b>nose</b> to tail. The stringer serves to increase the board's overall strength and reduce its flexibility. Some boards have multiple stringers.|$|R
50|$|Once the pheromone-mimicking {{hydrocarbon}} {{has changed}} the physiology of the animal's brain it does lots of things to the animal which {{can be read as}} signs they are affected. These include a spike of activity in the amygdala, gradual (over a few weeks) decline in vocalisation and increased use of pheromones to communicate. The animal also develops a hive mind {{and in the case of}} dogs, secretes a chemically unique hydrocarbon similar to dodecyl acetate, a common ant pheromone. The new chemical has an extremely high molecular weight and dissolves slowly, which might help explain its unusually strong effect on larger animals. Some other results of this chemical change are very fast metabolism, dull and perverted brain functions, flashes of energy, <b>running</b> <b>noses,</b> sweating, increase in blood pressure, blood flooded with adrenalin and bristling hair standing up with the dendrites and synapses in the brain firing, stimulated by the chemical. When car driving and cell phones are banned internationally, all of the symptoms vanish and the animal returns to normal within a day.|$|R

50|$|An {{aircraft}} in flight {{is free to}} rotate in three dimensions: pitch, nose up or down about an axis running from wing to wing; yaw, nose left or right about an axis running up and down; and roll, rotation about an axis <b>running</b> from <b>nose</b> to tail. The axes are alternatively designated as lateral, vertical, and longitudinal. These axes move with the vehicle and rotate relative to the Earth along with the craft. These definitions were analogously applied to spacecraft when the first manned spacecraft were designed in the late 1950s.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the secrets}} of healing springs is the {{presence}} of silver and flint in the water. Silver ions have antibacterial features. Organic remains of flint are capable of processing light energy {{in the tens of thousands}} of times the speed of regenerating reactions. Normal tap water, processed through flint, becomes healthier and can be preserved for many years. Flint water is bactericidal. It destroys the influenza virus, quickly stops external bleeding, soothes a toothache, is effective for angina and <b>running</b> <b>nose,</b> paradontosis, and eliminates heartburn.|$|E
50|$|The {{health effects}} of haze are mainly caused by the {{irritant}} effects of fine dust particles on the nose, throat, airways, skin and eyes. The {{health effects of}} haze depend on its severity {{as measured by the}} Pollutants Standards Index (PSI). There is also individual variation regarding the ability to tolerate air pollution. Most people would at most experience sneezing, <b>running</b> <b>nose,</b> eye irritation, dry throat and dry cough from the pollutants. They are mild and pose no significant danger {{to the health of the}} general population.|$|E
5000|$|Jordan is {{a six-year-old}} {{who came to}} Nyaru Menteng after being rescued from an illegal stage show, where he was trained to wrestle with other orangutans. Having been stolen from his mother while still a baby, he has little {{experience}} interacting with other orangutans and enters the island {{at the bottom of}} the social hierarchy. Jordan once attacked alpha male Hamlet with a bottle, but Hamlet seemed to be understanding and didn't punish him severely. Owing to a deviated septum, Jordan has a constantly <b>running</b> <b>nose.</b> In episode 4, he attempted to drink the engine oil out of a bottle he has found, which would have killed him had the Teknisi not spotted him in time.|$|E

50|$|Tessier number 1, 2, 12 and 13 are the paramedian clefts. These clefts {{are quite}} similar to the midline clefts, but they are further away from the midline of the face. Tessier number 1 and 2 both come through the maxilla and the nose, in which Tessier number 2 is further from the midline (lateral) than number 1. Tessier number 12 is in extent of number 2, {{positioned}} between nose and frontal bone, while Tessier number 13 is in extent of number 1, also <b>running</b> between <b>nose</b> and forehead. Both 12 and 13 run between the midline and the orbit.|$|R
50|$|The Fafnir 2 {{landed on}} a long skid, <b>running</b> from the <b>nose</b> almost to the wing {{trailing}} edge. A drop-off dolly was sometimes used for take-off.

50|$|Ickler {{kept the}} car running {{and was able}} to {{continue}} but a caution was not thrown and the race continued under green. Christopher and Sellers were <b>running</b> <b>nose</b> to tail for the lead. Coming out of turn 4 on lap 148 Ickler was {{directly in front of the}} leaders and Christopher seemed to have to check up a little bit to not get into Ickler. This led to Sellers getting into the rear of Christopher and sending him spinning towards the outside wall. Sellers would take the lead and the white flag as Christopher came to a rest near the wall out of turn 4. The yellow came out and Sellers crossed the line in first place under the yellow/checkered flags and took the win.|$|E
50|$|His team-mate Jules Bianchi {{found his}} way by Chilton two laps later, but he didn't {{seem to have the}} pace of his team-mate in race {{conditions}} here, dropping time while Bird ran a string of fastest laps to catch up to the leading pair. The Englishman soon caught up to d'Ambrosio, but the nature of the fast flowing circuit meant there was little chance of a pass unless someone made a mistake. With the top three <b>running</b> <b>nose</b> to tail {{for the remainder of the}} race Vietoris held on for the win one second ahead of d'Ambrosio, who took second by just one tenth from Bird. Bianchi solidified third in the championship with another points finish for fourth, with Chilton hanging on for fifth against race long pressure from Oliver Turvey. But with Perez unable to improve on 13th position the championship finally belonged to Maldonado, who celebrated with his team in the pits as the chequered flag dropped for his rivals. The Venezuelan takes his place in history alongside Nico Rosberg, Lewis Hamilton, Timo Glock, Giorgio Pantano and Nico Hülkenberg as the newest GP2 champion.|$|E
50|$|In 2003 GRM built {{a second}} {{car for the}} legendary touring car driver Peter Brock. It was this second car which won the 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour with Jason Bright, Todd Kelly and Greg Murphy sharing the driving with Brock. The winning car from 2002, driven by the same four drivers as the {{previous}} year, finished second, less than one second behind after 24 hours of racing. With seven minutes {{to go in the}} race, and with the two Monaros <b>running</b> <b>nose</b> to tail, Garry Rogers gave Murphy and Tander permission to race each other to the finish, with orders to respect the work put into the event by the team and not to take each other out. Tander was all over Murphy in the final four laps of the race and set the race's fastest lap of 2:14.489 with just three laps to go, while Murphy's corresponding lap time was a 2:14.499, which was his car's fastest lap of the race. Tander's last chance at snatching victory from Murphy with a last lap lunge into Murray's Corner was thwarted due to yellow flags on the last lap forcing him to stay behind and finish second. For Brock, the 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour would be his last ever win at Mount Panorama, and would be seen by some (including himself) as his tenth Bathurst win, despite the race not being the traditional Bathurst 1000 where he had scored his nine other wins dating back to 1972.|$|E

50|$|The Woodland jumping mouse is a {{medium-sized}} rodent and {{is similar to}} the Zapus mice but differs in having a white tail tip, brighter colors, and the lack of a small premolar in the upper jaw. Its sides are yellowish or reddish-brown peppered with black hairs. Dark-tipped hairs are intermixed with the dark brown dorsal band <b>running</b> from <b>nose</b> to tail. The underparts and feet are white. The species is darker in the south. The mouse has precise thermoregulation when active, deep seasonal hibernation, a high lower critical temperature, and a poor ability to tolerate high ambient temperatures which are likely adaptations to living in the cold.|$|R
