40|$|BERL and the Institute of Public Policy at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) have {{combined}} to pull together an economic forecast for the Auckland region economy. Latest employment data <b>released</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> confirm that the much-heralded end of the recession remains {{little more than a}} technicality. This is as true for the Auckland economy as it is for its national counterpart. The net 13, 000 jobs shed from the Auckland economy over the past year mean annual employment contracted by nearly 3 percent over that period. Looking ahead, hopes of an export-led recovery for the New Zealand economy have been dashed by an exchange rate that defies any rational assessment of the fundamentals. Consequently, the short-term outlook for the Auckland economy is best described as unstable. Clearly, the next few months will be better than the first half of 2009, but there will be little to celebrate. We forecast: a sombre export picture for manufacturing; modest, at best, employment growth; a subdued outlook for retail trade; import growth slightly above national; net inward migration gains; moderate house price growth; growth in house building activity; guest nights treading water.

40|$|Wage earners {{are still}} the {{dominant}} group, says MARK WOODEN ACCORDING to new data <b>released</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the number of owner managers (that is, the self-employed) in November 2006 was little different from the number two years earlier. By contrast, {{the number of employees}} rose by almost 7. 5 per cent over this same period. Even more striking, the number of owner managers that the ABS, in its Forms of Employment Survey, defines as working on a contract basis declined by 9 per cent. This group of self-employed contractors was already a fairly small group, numbering just 450, 000 persons in 2004 (or only 4. 7 per cent of the employed workforce). But by 2006 it had shrunk even further, now numbering just 410, 000. Such trends fly {{in the face of the}} conventional wisdom pedalled by the critics of labour market reform. According to that line of argument, full-time permanent waged work will soon be a thing of the past. Instead, employment in the 21 st century will be characterised by increasingly ephemeral attachment between workers and employers. Many more jobs are expected to become temporary or short-term, and firms are expected to rely increasingly on external sources such as self-employed contractors or labour hire intermediaries to meet their labour requirements. These recent ABS numbers clearly challenge such assumptions. Traditional wage and salary earner employment remains the predominant mode of labour market engagement. Perhaps the decline in the number of self-employed contractors has been offset by a rise in the number of people employed through labour hire firms (and who would be defined by the ABS as being employees) ? The ABS survey does not provide data on this, but other data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey for 2005 suggests this hypothesis should be rejected. Indeed, the estimated number of people employed through a labour hire firm or temporary work agency is both relatively small (just over 3 per cent of all employees) and has declined in recent years (it fell by over 13 per cent in 2005). A large part of the explanation for these recent trends is likely to lie in the healthy state of the jobs market. On the demand side, a shrinking pool of unemployed labour together with expanding shortages in some sectors has almost certainly forced companies to offer many workers more secure employment contracts as part of a strategy to retain skilled and valued labour. On the supply side, rising real wages have increased the attractiveness of more traditional employer-employee relationships over indirect arrangements. It is also plausible that labour market reforms have had a role to play. If the various legislative reforms enacted by the Coalition government have provided greater flexibility for employers in the way they hire and fire and in the way they are able structure relationships with their employees then it follows that employers will feel less need to resort to outsourcing. The greater freedom provided to employers to fire whoever they like under Work Choices is an obvious example here. That said, it needs to be borne in mind that Work Choices only became law at the end of March 2006, towards the end of the period covered by the data reviewed here. In summary, traditional forms of employment remain the overwhelmingly dominant form of labour market engagement in Australia. Self-employed contractors, however, are not going to disappear. They will continue to remain a valuable option for many firms. The extent to which this type of labour engagement system is used will vary over time, depending on such things as the state of the economy, technological change and labour laws and institutions.
