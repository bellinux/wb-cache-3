25|$|When {{news of the}} {{purchase}} reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised. He had authorized the expenditure of $10 million for a port city, and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15 million on a land package which would double {{the size of the}} country. Jefferson's political opponents in the Federalist Party argued the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert, and that the Constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new land or negotiating treaties without the consent of the Senate. What <b>really</b> <b>worried</b> the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory, strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs. President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion, and held firm in his support for the treaty. Despite Federalist objections, the U.S. Senate ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20, 1803.|$|E

[...] After The Sun {{newspaper}} called Tomlinson a [...] "traitor" [...] and published his email address, he received death threats, and fearing for his life, went into hiding for a time. Government officials later conceded that the list did not originate from Tomlinson.|$|E
500|$|During the shooting, {{the crew}} had some {{problems}} in filming some scenes. Leto told MTV News, [...] "It's been an incredible adventure, but it's also been really difficult, {{because there are so}} many people, and we're shutting down streets of Los Angeles." [...] He further said that they were <b>really</b> <b>worried</b> about a scene regarding a lone horse running down a Los Angeles street: [...] "We only had three takes that we had time to do. The first take it went sideways, second take it went the other way. Third take? Perfect." [...] Leto described the experience of filming the music video saying, [...] "It's a lyrical and slightly metaphorical surreal journey through the city of Angels, from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Pier. We like to create an adventure and this has been an adventure. [...] This is what we were supposed to do. And I doubted the idea up until the very last minute, but the process has been phenomenal." [...] The music video premiered on November 9, 2009 at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles.|$|E

This place is so technical that you just have to concentrate on every corner and the mistake you made on the last one and how you make a better corner the next time through there.

500|$|In February 2012, Anthony and Tyler get {{involved}} with criminal Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Of this storyline Lapinksas said, [...] "I loved the challenge. Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was <b>really</b> <b>worried</b> as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was trying his best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice that we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E
500|$|No {{music video}} was filmed for {{promotion}} of [...] "Nothing Fails". Initially {{it was reported}} by Daily Mirror that Madonna planned to shoot the video in Israel with actor Michael Douglas. According to Polly Graham from the newspaper, Warner Bros. executives {{were concerned about the}} singer's safety in Israel, but Madonna was adamant. [...] "Her record bosses are <b>really</b> <b>worried</b> about it. They are trying to talk her around, but she's having none of it. She has told them it makes sense to shoot it in Israel as the Kabbalah originates from there. Madonna is not particularly bothered about her safety and potential risks. She doesn't think it's as bad as it seems." [...] Her then husband Guy Ritchie was also facing difficulty with his project, Revolver, which was rejected by Sony Pictures executives since it contained references to Kabbalah, and they asked Ritchie to re-write the script. Since the video itself would have included symbolism from Kabbalah, Madonna ultimately decided to not film the music video. These reports were later refuted by the artist during an interview with San Francisco radio station Alice 97.3, where she explained that no music video would be shot for the single.|$|E

2500|$|When Jack Swigert {{is getting}} ready to dock with the LM, a {{concerned}} NASA technician says: [...] "If Swigert can't dock this thing, we don't have a mission." [...] Lovell and Haise also seem worried. In his DVD commentary, the real Jim Lovell says that if Swigert had been unable to dock with the LM, he or Haise could have done it. He also says that Swigert was a well-trained Command Module Pilot and that no one was <b>really</b> <b>worried</b> about whether he was up to the job, but he admitted that it made a nice subplot for the film. What the astronauts were <b>really</b> <b>worried</b> about, Lovell says, was the expected rendezvous between the Lunar Module and the Command Module after Lovell and Haise left the surface of the Moon.|$|E

Daniel Williams examines these and other questions; by comparing the costs of decommissioning at comparable coal and {{nuclear power plants}}.
