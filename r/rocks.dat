5|$|Above these ignimbrites {{are found}} {{sedimentary}} <b>rocks</b> of the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. These were deposited in water, probably in a caldera lake, as the volcanic <b>rocks</b> weathered and were eroded. Structures in these <b>rocks</b> suggest the faults were still active and the caldera was still subsiding. Layers of tuff and lapilli-tuff indicate some ongoing volcanism.|$|E
5|$|Both {{coastline}} and the Coast Ranges can {{be found}} within park boundaries. The majority of the <b>rocks</b> in the parks {{are part of the}} Franciscan Assemblage, uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago. These sedimentary <b>rocks</b> are primarily sandstone, siltstone, shale, and chert, with lesser amounts of metamorphic <b>rocks</b> such as greenstone. For the most part, these <b>rocks</b> are easily eroded, and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges. Formed during the Cretaceous Period, they are highly deformed from uplift and folding processes. In some areas, river systems have created fluvial deposits of sand, mud, and gravel, which are transported into the park from upstream. Redwood Creek follows the Grogan Fault; along {{the west bank of the}} creek, schist and other metamorphic <b>rocks</b> {{can be found}}, while sedimentary <b>rocks</b> of the Franciscan Assemblage are located on the east bank.|$|E

5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has some}} of the most ancient <b>rocks</b> found in any U.S. National Park. The oldest <b>rocks</b> dated so far are 2,680 ± 12million years old, though even older <b>rocks</b> are {{believed}} to exist in the park. Formed during the Archean Eon (4 to 2.5billion years ago), these metamorphic <b>rocks</b> include gneiss, schist and amphibolites. Metamorphic <b>rocks</b> are the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range. 2,545million years ago, the metamorphic <b>rocks</b> were intruded by igneous granitic <b>rocks,</b> which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks. The light colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker metamorphic gneiss found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north. Magma intrusions of diabase <b>rocks</b> 765million years ago left dikes that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton. Granite and pegmatite intrusions also worked their way into fissures in the older gneiss. Precambrian <b>rocks</b> in Jackson Hole are buried deep under comparatively recent Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary deposits, as well as Pleistocene glacial deposits.|$|E
5|$|Metagreywackes and metapelites {{from two}} areas {{traversing}} {{one of these}} aureoles near Yellowknife have been studied. Most of the Slave province <b>rocks</b> are granitic with metamorphosed Yellowknife metasedimentary and volcanic <b>rocks.</b> Isotopic ages of these <b>rocks</b> is around , {{the time of the}} Kenoran orogeny. <b>Rocks</b> comprising the Slave province represent a high grade of metamorphism, intrusion and basement remobilization typical of Archean terranes. Migmatites, batholithic intrusive and granulitic metamorphic <b>rocks</b> show foliation and compositional banding; the <b>rocks</b> are uniformly hard and so thoroughly deformed that little foliation exists. Most Yellowknife Supergroup metasediments are tightly folded (isoclinal) or occur in plunging anticlines.|$|E

5|$|The <b>rocks</b> {{follow the}} calc-alkaline trend of magmatic differentiation, {{containing}} silicic lavas such as dacite. Their overall composition ranges from basaltic andesite to dacite, and the dominant lava <b>rocks</b> are andesite and basalt. Andesites range from green to gray in colour, and dacites are pink- and light-gray. The andesitic lavas contain phenocrysts of andesine, hornblende, plagioclase and hypersthene. Dacites have biotite, hornblende, plagioclase and quartz phenocrysts. Textures range from porphyritic to vitreophyritic. Andesites {{are more common}} in Pliocene <b>rocks,</b> and Pleistocene <b>rocks</b> tend to be dacitic. At least five cycles of andesite rock formation have been found on the southwest side of Koh-i-Sultan. Its <b>rocks</b> are typical volcanic-arc <b>rocks</b> in elemental chemistry, and may stem from mantle-derived magma. The satellite centre <b>rocks</b> differ from the main centre <b>rocks</b> in composition, suggesting that different processes generated the magmas which constructed the cones. There is a compositional trend from Bazman over Taftan to Sultan, with the latter having more potassium in its <b>rocks</b> than the other centres. Such compositional trends may come from different partial melting ratios and different fluid contributions to magma generation at each volcano.|$|E
