25|$|The usual {{definition}} of a PostBQP circuit family is one with two outbit qubits P (postselection) and Q (output) with a single measurement of P and Q at the end such that the probability of measuring P=1 has nonzero probability, the conditional probability Pr≥2/3 if the inputx is in the language, and Pr≥2/3 if the input x {{is not in the}} language. For technical <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> tweak the {{definition of}} PostBQP as follows: we require that Pr≥2n'c for some constant c depending on the circuit family. Note this choice does not affect the basic properties of PostBQP, and also it can be shown that any computation consisting of typical gates (e.g. Hadamard, Toffoli) has this property whenever Pr>0.|$|E

25|$|Materials of {{the smooth}} plains and very smooth plains are also {{concentrated}} {{mainly in the}} eastern part of the map area. The smooth plains unit has a lower density of small craters than does intermediate plains material and a somewhat hummocky surface with scattered small hills and knobs. The hummocks within fresh c5 craters may be mantled floor materials or incipient peak rings (see, for example, crater Callicrates at lat 66° S., long 32°; FDS 27402). The very smooth plains unit has virtually no visible small craters and displays smoother planar surfaces than those of the smooth plains unit. It occurs in the lowest areas within smooth plains material (including areas within buried crater depressions) and commonly within older craters. The areas of greatest concentration of smooth and very smooth plains materials also contain the most ridges, which suggests that ridges and the younger plains units are genetically related. Very smooth plains material for instance, commonly lies at the base of ridges or scarps. It occurs as small patches within the smooth plains unit that fills the crater Pushkin. Smooth plains material embays the ejecta blanket of a c3 crater on Pushkin’s rim at lat 66° S, long 28° (FDS 27402) and fills the interior and part of the outer-ring area of Bach. The distribution of these two youngest plains units may indicate that the smooth plains material as mapped is nothing more than a thin, discontinuous layer of very smooth plains material that mantles the older units. In this respect, it is similar to the lunar Cayley Formation, which is probably basin ejecta. However, unlike plains material of the lunar uplands, no source basin is evident for the mercurian smooth and very smooth plains units within the imaged part of the Bach region. Although such a source basin may lie within the part not imaged, intervening areas do not contain smooth or very smooth plains materials. For these <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> tentatively ascribe a volcanic origin to most of the smooth and very smooth plains material. The ridges appear to be of volcano-tectonic origin; the fracturing may have provided the means by which lavas reached the surface to form these younger plains units. Some very smooth and smooth plains materials that form the floors of c5 and c4 craters may be impact melt.|$|E

We wanted to showcase me by myself, feature-less, and we wanted to reveal that I can sing, and really connect with my music and my message. We felt that was the best introduction to No Boys Allowed." [...] Mosley Music Group and Interscope Records released the single via digital distribution in the United States on September 7, 2010.

500|$|The Indian {{television}} {{premiere of}} The Dirty Picture {{was set to}} be telecast on Sony Entertainment Television on 22 April 2012 at 12 noon and 8pm IST. The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court allowed the TV channel {{to go ahead with}} the scheduled telecast after the Central Board of Film Certification had cleared the film with 56 cuts, 36 of which were done by the producers, while other cuts were suggested by the Certification Board. It had to go through these cuts as the telecast of an adult-rated film during prime time in India is a violation of the Cable TV Network Rules, 1994 and the Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. Following this process, Sony Entertainment Television promoted the scheduled telecast. However, on the scheduled day, the film was not telecast, with the channel putting up a message stating, [...] "For unavoidable <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> regret to inform that The Dirty Picture will not be telecast today. Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted." [...] The Information and Broadcast Ministry informed the TV channel that it can air the film only after prime time: post 11pm.|$|E

500|$|... "Swingin Party" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Westerberg and {{produced}} by Tommy Ramone, and was recorded by The Replacements. It is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz, country and new wave. It features staccato chords instrumented by electric guitar. According to Bill Janovitz from AllMusic, the song climbs scales in a way reminiscent of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra (1967). The lyrics are introspective, and portray the protagonist's [...] "feigned nonchalance". Writing for Spin, editor J.D. opined that the song's theme is [...] "literary reflections" [...] as Westerberg sings, [...] "Quttin' school and goin' to work and never goin' fishin'". According to Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone, the song's theme is that [...] "life is a lilting series of ultimately empty, but nonetheless compulsory, soirees", while Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the song is [...] "about loneliness and youthful insecurity". In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Westerberg said: [...] "One of the <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> used to drink so much {{is that it was}} scary going up on stage. That's one of the things 'Swingin' Party' is all about on the album ... how it is a little frightening to put yourself on display all the time." ...|$|E

When questioned about the editorial decision to make Batwoman a gay character in an interview with Wizard Entertainment, DC Comics Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Dan DiDio stated [...] "It was from conversations we’ve had for expanding the DC Universe, for looking at levels of diversity. We wanted to have a cast that is much more reflective of today’s society and even today’s fanbase. One of the <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> made her gay is that, again when you have the Batman Family—a series of characters that aren’t super-powered and inhabit the same circle and the same city—you really want to have a point of difference. It was really important to me to make sure every character felt unique." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} {{after the first}} day's shooting, Corbijn told the band about Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia), hardy and twisted plants in the deserts of the American Southwest, and he {{suggested}} their use on the sleeve. Bono was pleased to discover the religious significance of the plant's etymology; according to Mormon legend, early settlers named the plant after the Old Testament prophet Joshua, as the tree's stretching branches reminded them of Joshua raising his hands in prayer. The following day, Bono declared that the album should be titled The Joshua Tree. That morning, while driving on Route 190 near Darwin, they spotted a lone-standing tree in the desert. Corbijn had been {{hoping to find a}} single tree, as he thought it would result in better photographs than if he shot the band amongst a group of trees. They stopped the bus and photographed with the lone plant for about 20 minutes, something the Edge called [...] "fairly spontaneous". Despite shooting in the desert, the group dealt with cold weather during parts of the trip. Bono explained, [...] "it was freezing and we had to take our coats off so it would at least look like a desert. That's one of the <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> look so grim." [...] Regarding the serious tone of the images, Corbijn said, [...] "I guess people felt they took themselves too seriously. It was definitely the most serious, I think, that you can photograph a band. You couldn't go any further down that line unless you start photographing graves." ...|$|E

James Poniewozik of Time magazine called it [...] "a fabulous season – the best thing on TV in 2011 so far".

New York magazine writer Willa Paskin praised the show for comedy grounded in optimism and characters who genuinely like each other, rather than the cynical humor more prevalent in other comedy shows of the time. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called it a [...] "remarkable season of TV comedy" [...] without a single bad episode. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said although he considered Parks and Recreation the funniest sitcom on television during its second season, [...] "it somehow got even better" [...] during the third. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic said during the third season, Parks and Recreation was [...] "the funniest, sweetest, most consistent sitcom on television", and that the way the characters were seeking new opportunities outside the parks department {{by the end of the}} season demonstrates the show is willing to change and is [...] "not content to simply spin its wheels". Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said he believed that the third season [...] "will become to be recognized as one of the best seasons of any sitcom ever", and that the characters and setting of Pawnee were so fully developed that he felt a close, personal connection to them.
