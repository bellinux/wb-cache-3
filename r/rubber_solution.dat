5|$|The work {{of makeup}} artist Phil Leakey in {{transforming}} Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature {{was a key}} contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid <b>rubber</b> <b>solution</b> mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed {{from time to time in}} the film, were also made by Leakey.|$|E
500|$|Since {{at least}} 1938, Jefferis had been {{toying with the}} idea of a {{demolition}} or anti-tank weapon that would be ideal for irregular warfare. It would work by having an explosive charge deform so that it had a substantial area of intimate contact with the surface of the target. Then, when detonated, the effect of the explosion would be focused on a small area and would rupture an armoured plate much thicker than would otherwise be the case. Sappers call such a device a [...] "poultice" [...] or [...] "squash head" [...] charge. Jefferis enlisted Drs Bauer and Schulman of the Colloid Science Department of Cambridge University, they experimented with lengths of bicycle inner tube filled with plasticine to represent the explosive.

This New York business initially manufactured only skin condoms (in 1890 he was arrested by Anthony Comstock for having almost seven hundred of the devices in his house). [...] In 1912, a German named Julius Fromm developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw <b>rubber</b> <b>solution.</b> Called cement dipping, this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid. [...] In America, Schmid was the first company to use the new technique. Using the new dipping method, French condom manufacturers were the first to add textures to condoms. [...] Fromm was the first company to sell a branded line of condoms, Fromm's Act, which remains popular Germany today. [...] The condom lines manufactured by Schmid, Shieks and Ramses, were sold through the late 1990s. [...] Youngs Rubber Company, founded by Merle Youngs in late 19th century America, introduced Trojans.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster {{develops}} focal {{myocardial necrosis}} beginning at 1 month of age, {{which leads to}} eventual ventricular failure within 1 year. The pathogenesis of this myocytolytic necrosis is unknown. Based {{on the nature of}} the cell necrosis, cytochemical evidence of vascular alterations, and the sensitivity of the hamsters to catecholamines and other vasoactive substances, we believe that the cardiomyopathy may be mediated by abnormalities of the microcirculation. Nonetheless, until the present study, no significant changes have been observed in these vessels. To elucidate the pathogenesis of this disease, we perfused living cardiomyopathic hamsters with silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>solutions,</b> which revealed numerous areas of microvascular constriction, diffuse vessel narrowing and luminal irregularity. Fixed structural lesions in these vessels could not be demonstrated. Pretreatment of young hamsters with verapa-mil during the period when they normally develop myocardial necrosis prevented myocytolytic lesions and abolished microvascular hyperreactivity. We believe that focal, transient spasm of small blood vessels, probably secondary to vasoactive substances, may cause myocytolytic necrosis (a form of reperfusion injury) in this model. This may also be a multifactorial disease with myocellular as well as vascular abnormalities leading to myocardial degeneration. The similarity of this disease to human and experimental cardiomyopathy suggests that microvascular spasm may be a common denominator of many differen...|$|R

Waterproof dress had {{an important role in the}} late nineteenth century. Heretofore little research has been done to examine the development and design of this apparel sector. The three types of waterproofing techniques used and developed in the nineteenth century included oil or paraffin, chemical, and <b>rubber</b> <b>solutions.</b> The rise leisure and consumption contributed to the growth of waterproof dress allowing people of all classes to benefit from the protective apparel. This research explored the technology and design of waterproof dress by collecting related patents between 1880 and 1895. These patents were compared with catalogs and periodicals from the same time period to better understand what innovations made their way to consumers. The patents helped to identify the problems with waterproof apparel that manufacturers sought to resolve. In addition, the patents assisted with clarifying the target consumers for specific apparel types. The research also revealed the longevity of the gossamer or lightweight rubber garment that experienced at least two decades of success. Overall, this research emphasized that waterproof dress was very important in the lives of many consumers toward the end of the nineteenth century...|$|R

50|$|Polystyrene {{generally}} has stiffness, transparency, processibility, and dielectric qualities {{that make it}} useful. However, its low impact resistance at low temperatures makes catastrophic fracture failure when cold more likely. The most widely used version of toughened polystyrene is called high impact polystyrene or HIPS. Being cheap and easy to thermoform (see thermoforming), it is utilized for many everyday uses. HIPS is made by polymerizing styrene in a polybutadiene <b>rubber</b> <b>solution.</b> After the polymerization reaction begins, the polystyrene and rubber phases separate. When  phase separation begins, the two phases compete for volume until phase inversion occurs and the rubber can distribute throughout the matrix. The alternative emulsion polymerization with styrene-butadiene-styrene or styrene-butadiene copolymers allows fine-tuned manipulation of particle size distribution. This method makes use of the core-shell architecture.|$|E
