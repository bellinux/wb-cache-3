5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{character}} being confronted at a triumphant feast with a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> their downfall {{is not unique to}} Shakespeare and may originate from the Belshazzar's feast episode of the Bible. The term 'ghost at the feast' has entered popular culture, and is often used as a metaphor for a subject a person would rather avoid considering, or (considering the general plot of Macbeth) a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> a person's unpleasant past or likely future.|$|E
5|$|For many {{communities}} {{the existence of}} buildings that formerly housed residential schools are a traumatic <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the system's legacy, {{and there has been}} much discussion about demolition, heritage status and how the possibility of incorporating sites into the healing process.|$|E
5|$|The EPB {{was founded}} by Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, Juan Enrique Segarra-Palmer and Orlando González Claudio on July 26, 1976, with the date being symbolically used as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the United States {{invasion}} during the Spanish–American War. It can trace its origins back to the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN).|$|E
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> {{mortality}} lead people to engage in defenses to minimize the anxiety such thoughts could arouse. In accord with this notion, younger adults reminded of mortality engage in behaviors aimed at denying vulnerability to death. However, {{little is known about}} the effects <b>of</b> mortality <b>reminders</b> on older adults. The present study examined the effect <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> death on older adults' subjective life expectancy. Mortality reminders did not significantly impact the life expectancy estimates <b>of</b> old-old adults. <b>Reminders</b> <b>of</b> death did however lead to shorter life expectancy estimates among young-old participants low in neuroticism but longer life expectancy estimates among young-old participants high in neuroticism, suggesting that this group was most defensive in response to <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> death...|$|R

5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, {{the purpose}} of kashrut was to help Jews {{maintain}} a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; {{he says that the}} effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> their distinct status as Jews.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} a {{worldwide}} disbandment of British forts as advances in air defence systems caused them to become obsolete. Today, the ruins of coastal fortifications are still visible at Labrador Battery, Mount Faber, Fort Siloso and Fort Canning that serve as a lasting <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> their wartime legacy in Fortress Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the general}} effects of {{invasive}} animals {{is not as}} profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and a constant <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, {{to the surprise of}} all.|$|E

5|$|Between 1873 and 1875, mineowners Fletcher Burrows built a small {{model village}} at Howe Bridge, {{comprising}} cottages, shops, a village club, and a bath house for their employees. This Victorian village {{on either side}} of Leigh Road, together with St Michael and All Angel's Church, is a conservation area. The Ena Mill, one of Atherton's large spinning mills, complete with chimney, survives as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the textile industry.|$|E
5|$|Kent Ridge Park, Labrador Park, {{and the war}} museum, {{are part}} of the Pasir Panjang Historic District, which focuses on World War II {{battlefield}} events in western Singapore. Together with Fort Siloso at Sentosa and The Battle Box at Fort Canning, they serve as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> an important chapter in Singapore's modern history. Near {{to the top of the}} ridge, there is a commemorative heritage site marker which shows the area where the Battle of Pasir Panjang of 1942 was fought.|$|E

5|$|While {{incurring}} significant casualties {{fighting the}} Black Legion, the Chetnik movement in eastern Bosnia {{benefited from the}} mass desertion of Partisans and the many pro-Chetnik coups in Partisan and volunteer detachments. Despite their lack of unity, the Chetnik movement thrived in eastern Bosnia for the <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> 1942 because some Chetnik leaders made accommodations with the Ustaše regime and as many Chetniks and Partisans were unwilling to kill fellow Bosnian Serbs of the opposing faction.|$|E
5|$|A small plaque erected by the Datchet Parish Council in 2000 is {{the only}} <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the Divided Bridge. Datchet High Street which once {{continued}} on over the bridge to Berkshire ends abruptly at the Thames and the bank on the Buckinghamshire side is now occupied by a marina car park. The Crown and Angel public house on the Berkshire bank depicted {{in many of the}} contemporary drawings of the bridge was demolished {{at the same time as}} the bridge; a Victorian estate cottage now stands its place.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.|$|E
50|$|Changes in {{behavior}} due to avoidance (or its opposite, excessive proximity-seeking—refraining from going places, doing things, or having contact {{with things that}} are <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> the loss; feeling drawn to <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> the person—wanting to see, touch, hear or smell things to feel close {{to the person who}} died). Both symptoms may coexist in the same individual.|$|R

5|$|Avoiding {{stereotypes}} and labeling {{based on personal}} dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as uniforms. Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, which is a visible <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell {{at the conclusion of}} the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.|$|E

It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 100,000 copies across United States.|$|E

He placed an empty coffee cup on the flap handle as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the position of the flaps, a procedure used by many flight crews. The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> ingroup responsibility for past wrongdoings on perception of ingroup responsibility and victim dehumanization as predictors of empathy. Two experiments set in different intergroup contexts found that <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> ingroup responsibility generated empathy through perception of ingroup responsibility and defl ected empathy through subtle victim dehumanization. In Experiment 1, set {{in the context of}} indigenous–non-indigenous relations in Chile (N = 124), it was found that <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> ingroup (vs. individual) responsibility generated empathy by increasing a perception of ingroup responsibility and defl ected it through decreased attribution of secondary emotions to the victim group. Experiment 2 replicated the effects in a different context, the recent 1992 – 1995 war in Bosnia (N = 158). <b>Reminders</b> <b>of</b> ingroup responsibility (vs. no reminders) generated empathy by increasing a perception of ingroup responsibility and defl ected it through decreased attribution of secondary emotions to the victim group. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R
5|$|In 1881 Barlow sat {{as member}} of the Wind Pressure (Railway Structures) Commission {{established}} at {{the recommendation of the}} Tay Bridge report. He led the design of the replacement Tay Bridge (188287) with his son Crawford Barlow as engineer. The new design used large monocoque piers to support a double railway track. The old brick and masonry piers from the first bridge were retained as breakwaters for the new piers upstream. They can still be seen today as a forlorn <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the tragedy of 1879.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Sunderland {{moved to}} their present ground, Stadium of Light in Monkwearmouth, which was opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Built with an {{original}} capacity of 42,000, it hosted its first game against Dutch team Ajax. The stadium bears a similar {{name to the}} Portuguese club Benfica's ground Estádio da Luz, albeit in a different language. Stadium expansion in 2000 saw the capacity increase to 49,000. A Davy lamp monument stands outside the stadium, and a miners banner {{was presented to the}} club by the Durham Miners' Association, as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the Monkwearmouth Colliery pit the stadium was built on.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, {{the park was}} long known chiefly for its {{isolated}} location and primitive camping facilities. In August 1952it played host to the first Woodsmen's Carnival, an annual celebration of the lumbering industry, which was again active in the second growth forests in the area. The festival, originally sponsored by the Penn-York Lumbermen's Club, features lumberjack competitions as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the past, as well as displays of new equipment. In 1987the Galeton Rotary Club took over sponsorship, and renamed the event the Woodsmen's Show in 1990.|$|E
