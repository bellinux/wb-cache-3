40|$|<b>Rent</b> seeking {{is often}} studied with {{reference}} to a contemporaneous <b>rent</b> evaluated {{at a point in}} time. We study the social cost of <b>rent</b> seeking when <b>rents</b> endure over time, but may have to be re-contested because of imperfect <b>rent</b> protection, or may disappear because of deregulation. The present value of a contested <b>rent</b> measures the social cost of <b>rent</b> seeking, irrespective of imperfect <b>rent</b> protection and the prospect of deregulation. <b>Rent</b> seeking is discouraged by the inability of governments to commit to protect <b>rents</b> and by their inability to commit to rent-generating regulations and policies. Moreover, lasting deregulation can preempt a substantial fraction of the potential <b>rent</b> seeking cost. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{social costs}} of <b>rent</b> seeking are {{generally}} evaluated with respect to <b>rent</b> dissipation. A common assumption is complete <b>rent</b> dissipation so {{that the value of}} a contested <b>rent</b> is the value of social loss. When <b>rent</b> seekers earn taxable income, there is interdependence between the social cost of <b>rent</b> seeking through <b>rent</b> dissipation and the excess burden of taxation. Through the addition of substitution to <b>rent</b> seeking beyond leisure, <b>rent</b> seeking increases the excess burden of taxation under risk neutrality when leisure is non-inferior. We derive a condition for <b>rent</b> seeking to increase the excess burden of taxation under risk aversion. Our conclusion is that, when <b>rent</b> seekers can earn taxable income, <b>rent</b> seeking is more socially costly than is inferred from contest models alone, because of an increased excess burden of taxation...|$|R

The second dimension is whether {{the aim is to}} protect the tenants against <b>rents</b> over the market level, against sudden big increases in <b>rents</b> or if the aim is to keep <b>rents</b> permanently below market levels in attractive areas.

40|$|This study {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} how the construction and replacement of urban housing may be affected by <b>rent</b> stabilization. One of the primary insights is that neither the timing nor the density of development will be affected by <b>rent</b> stabilization because allowing perfectly flexible base <b>rents</b> permits landlords to capture all of the advantages of a <b>rent</b> growth control. However, redevelopment is hastened because <b>rent</b> stabilization complemented by vacancy decontrol increases the difference between <b>rents</b> before and after redevelopment, increasing the opportunity costs of postponing redevelopment.

40|$|Urban land <b>rent</b> {{theory has}} both fascinated and {{repelled}} researchers. The fascination {{stems from the}} idea that <b>rent</b> holds the key to urban spatial structures and distributional conflicts. The repulsion is based on bemusement at the complexity and jargon of the <b>rent</b> literature and rejection of <b>rent's</b> assumed centrality. In this paper the author surveys the urban <b>rent</b> literature and presents an alternative interpretation {{of the role of}} urban <b>rent.</b> It is suggested that the ambiguous theoretical status of urban land <b>rent</b> stems from an overemphasis in the <b>rent</b> literature on the distributional implications of <b>rent</b> mechanisms at the expense of their potential influence on the social relations of building provision. The neoclassical economics model of urban <b>rent</b> and land use is critically evaluated and the extensive attempts to apply Marx's theory of <b>rent</b> to the urban situation are questioned. The ability to revive Marxist urban <b>rent</b> theory through the treatment of <b>rent</b> as a component of structures of building provision is then elaborated by reference to housing provision and office development. When placed in such a historical context, it is suggested, <b>rent</b> takes on a more meaningful, if less messianic, role. ...|$|R
