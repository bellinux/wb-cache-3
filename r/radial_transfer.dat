40|$|Abstract Background The sucrose that accumulates in the culm of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) {{and other}} large {{tropical}} andropogonoid grasses can be of commercial value, and can buffer assimilate supply during development. Previous study conducted with intact plants showed that sucrose can be radially transferred to the intracellular compartment of mature ripening sorghum internode without being hydrolysed. In this study, culm-infused radiolabelled sucrose was traced between cellular compartments and among related metabolites {{to determine if the}} compartmental path of sucrose during <b>radial</b> <b>transfer</b> in culm tissue was symplasmic or included an apoplasmic step. This transfer path was evaluated for elongating and ripening culm tissue of intact plants of two semidwarf grain sorghums. The metabolic path in elongating internode tissue was also evaluated. Results On the day after culm infusion of the tracer sucrose, the specific radioactivity of sucrose recovered from the intracellular compartment of growing axillary-branch tissue was greater (nearly twice) than that in the free space, indicating that sucrose was preferentially transferred through symplasmic routes. In contrast, the sucrose specific radioactivity in the intracellular compartment of the mature (ripening) culm tissue was probably less (about 3 / 4 's) than that in free space indicating that sucrose was preferentially transferred through routes that included an apoplasmic step. In growing internodes of the axillary branch of sorghum, the tritium label initially provided in the fructose moiety of sucrose molecules was largely (81 %) recovered in the fructose moiety, indicating that a large portion of sucrose molecules is not hydrolysed and resynthesized during <b>radial</b> <b>transfer.</b> Conclusion During <b>radial</b> <b>transfer</b> of sucrose in ripening internodes of intact sorghum plants, much of the sucrose is transferred intact (without hydrolysis and resynthesis) and primarily through a path that includes an apoplasmic step. In contrast, much of the sucrose is transferred through a symplasmic path in growing internode (axillary branch) tissue. These results contrast with the probable symplasmic path in mature culm of the closely related species, sugarcane. Phylogenetic variability exists in the compartmental path of <b>radial</b> <b>transfer</b> of sucrose in culms of the andropogonoid grasses. </p...|$|E

Finally, the network parameters including mean iteration, standard variation, standard deviation, convergent time, and optimized error are evaluated using the mean squared error.

This manifests itself in a change of pathway of the global pi current, as Z increases from Z = 0, from an inner- through a bifurcated- to an outer-pathway.

Safety investigations for Preliminary Design Studies of an Experimental Accelerator Driven System (PDS-XADS) {{were performed}} with the computational code SIMMER-III, which was originally developed for the safety assessments of sodium-cooled fast reactors. For the present study, SIMMER-III had been extended so as to describe the XADS-specific configurations such as heavy-metal (lead-bismuth eutectic) coolant, sub-critical core and strong external neutron source. As transient scenarios, unprotected loss of flow (ULOF), unprotected local blockage in a single assembly and unprotected entire blockage above core region were analyzed. The ULOF simulation showed that the remaining natural convection of the coolant would prevent the cladding steel from heating-up and pin disruption. In the local blockage simulation, it was shown that no cladding failure might be expected due to the <b>radial</b> heat <b>transfer</b> and the coolant flow in the gap space between adjacent can walls. Under an artificial suppression of the <b>radial</b> heat <b>transfer</b> and the coolant flow in the gap space, a pin failure occurred but subsequent fuel sweep-out into the upper plenum region would bring a reactivity reduction and no power excursion.

A model for the effective transport coefficients in a stochastic magnetic field, taking into account both parallel flows and perpendicular transfer of anomalous nature, has been incorporated into the 1. 5 D transport code RITM for self-consistent calculations of the radial profiles of plasma parameters. Computations have been performed for the tokamak TEXTOR to simulate phases in an ohmic shot without and with the Dynamic Ergodic Divertor (DED). Results show that the increase of the outward convective transport in the stochastic boundary layer leads to a drop of the line average density. The experimentally observed density variation is reproduced by adjusting the amplitude of the stochastization characteristics with their radial dependence predicted by the field line mapping.

In order to analyse the influence of this structure on the fluid flow and the <b>radial</b> mass <b>transfer</b> properties, the study of sphere packings in cylindrical container and flow simulations at the pore scale are carried out. A collocated finite volume is used to solve the 3 D Navier–Stokes equations. The Reynolds number ranges from 7 to 200 allowing to use the direct numerical simulation method in stationary flow regime combined to the no-slip condition at the interface solid/fluid. Therefore no correlation are used in this study. Furthermore, representative fixed beds, composed of several hundreds of spheres, are used for a diameter ratio of 5. 96 and 7. 8. Radial profile of the longitudinal velocity and the probability density function of the velocity components agree with the experimental data found in the literature. At low Reynolds number, the computation of current lines reveals the presence, at the reactor wall, of a layer whose width is around one-fourth of the sphere diameter. In this layer, the fluid flow is longitudinal and tangential. Particle tracking reveals also {{the existence of a}} second layer all along the spheres in contact with the reactor wall.

Using synchrotron radiation small-angle x-ray scattering, this study investigated in the in situ heart and in real-time whether changes in cross-bridge disposition and myosin interfilament spacing underlie the early development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Experiments were conducted using anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats 3  weeks after treatment with either vehicle (control) or streptozotocin (diabetic). Diffraction patterns were recorded during baseline and dobutamine infusions simultaneous with ventricular pressure-volumetry. From these diffraction patterns myosin mass transfer to actin filaments was assessed as the change in intensity ratio (I 1, 0 /I 1, 1). In diabetic hearts cross-bridge disposition was most notably abnormal in the diastolic phase (p < 0. 05) {{and to a lesser}} extent the systolic phase (p < 0. 05). In diabetic rats only, there was a transmural gradient of contractile depression. Elevated diabetic end-diastolic intensity ratios were correlated with the suppression of diastolic function (p < 0. 05). Furthermore, the expected increase in myosin head transfer by dobutamine was significantly blunted in diabetic animals (p < 0. 05). Interfilament spacing did not differ between groups.

40|$|In this paper, the {{properties}} {{and the formation}} of collective electromagnetic trap for electron beam that propagates in a conducting cylinder are described. It is shown that the electron beam provides the development of an electrostatic instability in the above-mentioned conditions. The instability leads to the appearance of a non-stationary virtual cathode {{and the formation of}} electrostatic potential trap. This phenomenon takes place in the central region of the drive space where the amplitude of the electrostatic potential has two maxima. The trap confines electrons during its formation and keeps them inside the drift tube. Once seized in the trap, electrons have rather low temperature and are unstable to diocotron oscillations. During the evolution of diocotron instability the spatial charge redistribution takes place in the cross-section of the beam, which is probably connected with the drift of electrons in longitudinal magnetic field. This process is accompanied not only by azimuthal redistribution of the beam density, but also by <b>radial</b> <b>transfer</b> of electrons across magnetic field, which leads to the increase of the radial beam dimensions and to the injection of electrons onto the walls of the drift chamber.
