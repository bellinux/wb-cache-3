40|$|Introduction: Increasedlife {{expectancy}} in populations {{has brought}} along specific new scenarios {{in the fields}} of medicine for the elderly; prevalence of physical complications such as edentulism and patients with dentures is growing. Management of anesthesia and ventilation in this group of patients has turned into a great challenge. Some researchers suggest dentures to be left in place during bag-mask ventilation; yet, no unanimous agreement exists in this regard. Methods: In a single blind randomized clinical trial, we studied 300 patients with ASA class I, II (American Society of Anesthesiologists), Mallampati class (I, II) and aged over 55 years in three groups. After induction of anesthesia, in group G dentures were removed and in each buccal space an eight-layer 10 × 10 cm gauze and an oral airway were placed. In group D, the dentures and an oral airway were left in place. In group C (control), after removing dentures just an appropriate oral airway was placed. Then, each three group underwent bag-mask ventilation. Success of bag-mask ventilation (BMV) was considered as increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide to more than 20 mmHg and back to baseline with fresh gas flow of 3 L/min and adjustable <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>valve</b> <b>pressure</b> of 20 cm H 2 O. Success rates were evaluated between groups. Results: Effective BMV was possible in 91 (91 %), 64 (64 %) and 41 (41 %) patients in groups G, D and C respectively. The differences were statistically significant. Successful BMV rate was significantly higher in female patients in group G compared to group C; 43 / 44 versus 25 / 46 individuals, P = 0. 0001, odds ratio = 0. 03, 95 % confidence interval (0. 00, 0. 22). Conclusions: Leaving dentures in place in edentulous patients after inducing anesthesia improves bag-mask ventilation. However, placing folded compressed gauze in buccal space leads to more significant improvement in BMV compared to leaving dentures in place...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Rapid {{and safe}} airway {{management}} {{has always been}} of paramount importance in successful management of critically ill and injured patients in the emergency department. The purpose of our {{study was to determine}} success rates of bag-mask ventilation and tracheal intubation performed by emergency medicine residents before and after completing their anesthesiology curriculum. Methods A prospective descriptive study was conducted at Nikoukari Hospital, a teaching hospital located in Tabriz, Iran. In a skills lab, a total number of 18 emergency medicine residents (post graduate year 1) were given traditional intubation and bag-mask ventilation instructions in a 36 hour course combined with mannequin practice. Later the residents were given the opportunity of receiving training on airway management in an operating room for a period of one month which was considered as an additional training program added to their Anesthesiology Curriculum. Residents were asked to ventilate and intubate 18 patients (Mallampati class I and ASA class I and II) in the operating room; both before and after completing this additional training program. Intubation achieved at first attempt within 20 seconds was considered successful. Successful bag-mask ventilation was defined as increase in ETCo 2 to 20 mm Hg and back to baseline with a 3 L/min fresh gas-flow and the adjustable <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>valve</b> at 20 cm H 2 O. An attending anesthesiologist who was always present in the operating room during the induction of anesthesia confirmed the endotracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy and capnography. Success rates were recorded and compared using McNemar, marginal homogeneity and paired t-Test tests in SPSS 15 software. Results Before the additional training program in the operating room, the participants had intubation and bag-mask ventilation success rates of 27. 7 % (CI 0. 07 - 0. 49) and 16. 6 % (CI 0 - 0. 34) respectively. After the additional training program in the operating room the success rates increased to 83. 3 % (CI 0. 66 - 1) and 88. 8 % (CI 0. 73 - 1), respectively. The differences in success rates were statistically significant (P = 0. 002 and P = 0. 0004, respectively). Conclusions The success rate of emergency medicine residents in airway management improved significantly after completing anesthesiology rotation. Anesthesiology rotations should be considered as an essential component of emergency medicine training programs. A collateral curriculum of this nature should also focus on the acquisition of skills in airway management. </p...|$|R

In the control group: During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the ventilator was turned off and adjustable <b>pressure</b> <b>limit</b> (APL) <b>valve</b> was placed in SPONT position. In CPAP group: During CPB, after turning the ventilator off, the flow of oxygen flow was maintained at the rate of 0. 5 L/min and the APL valve was placed in MAN position on 20 mbar. During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) weaning, the patients were observed for air bubbles in left atrium by using transesophageal echocardiography.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigations}} on the accident behaviour of the HTR-Modul was an assessment of expected risk. In addition to accidents in which forced cooling of the core is not possible for a prolonged period of time/ a further priority issue was the analysis of event sequences after steam generator leaks. It {{became apparent that the}} accident topology of the HTR-Modul is no longer characterized by failure of the core cooling system, {{as in the case of}} larger plants, since the possible temperature loads on the fuel elements only slightly impair their capacity to retain fission products. This is the characteristic design feature of the modular reactor; due to the coregeometry, power and power density', there is no need for a forced cooling of the core in order to prevent fission product release, even in the long term. In the case of failure of the operational cooling system, the afterheat is passively dissipated via the surface of the reactor pressure vessel to a surface cooling system lining the concrete reactor cell. The reactor pressure vessel and concrete structures are thus protected against excessively high temperatures. The fuel element temperatures reach a maximum of 1100 °C in a pressurized reactor without forced cooling. The temperatures rise to 1000 °C in the top reflector and to 320 °C in the reactor pressure vessel wall; they thus remain below the respective values specified. In the case of a depressurized reactor, the fuel element temperature increases to 510 °C and the vessel temperature to 350 °C, whereas the temperature of the top reflector decreases to 600 °C. An additional failure of the surface cooler essentially affects only the temperatures in the walls of the reactor pressure vessel and reactor cell. The vessel then reaches 600 °C and has to be depressurized. The concrete structures retain enough of their load-carrying capacity to ensure the stability of the vessel. Rupture of the sphere discharge tube was examined in order to comprehensively cover problems of criticality in hypothetical events. A high subcriticality was ascertained even for the most unfavourable rearrangement of the pebble bed. In order to control operational disturbances which would prevent a shutdown of the plant, in all cases scram of the reactor and also of the blower is envisaged for the HTR-Modul. In the case of failure of the steam generator feed together with postulated failure of blower scram, a thermal overloading of the primary circuit is not expected. The heat capacity of the primary circuit components is sufficient to absorb the stored energy of the core without the. vessel temperatures exceedingthe permissible value of 400 °C. If the reactor scram were assumed to fail simultaneously the blower would be endangered in the first instance. Studies on the pressure build-up in the primary circuit in connection with steam generator leaks have revealed that the primary circuit remains completely functional as a barrier for the risk-relevant leak sizes (< IF) even if steam generator depressurization fails. Only if the gas purification plant also fails does the <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>valve</b> of the primary circuit respond with a filtered release of the activity to the environment. If the steam generator is properly depressurized, the valve responds only once, releasing about 10...|$|R
40|$|A {{breathing}} system {{is defined as}} an assembly of components, which delivers gases from the anesthesia machine to the patients′ airways. When the components are arranged as a circle, it is termed a circle system. The flow of exhaled gases is unidirectional in the system. The system contains a component (absorber), which absorbs exhaled carbon dioxide {{and it is not}} necessary to give high fresh gas flows as in Mapleson systems. When the adjustable <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> (APL) <b>valve</b> is closed and all the exhaled gases without carbon dioxide are returned to the patient, the system becomes a totally closed one. Such a circle system can be used with flows as low as 250 to 500 mL and clinically can be termed as low-flow systems. The components of the circle system can be arranged in different ways with adherence to basic rules: (1) Unidirectional valve must be present between the reservoir bag and the patient on both inspiratory and expiratory sides; (2) fresh gas must not enter the system between the expiratory unidirectional valve and the patient; and (3) the APL valve must not be placed between the patient and the inspiratory unidirectional valve. The functional analysis is explained in detail. During the function, the arrangement of components is significant only at higher fresh gas flows. With the introduction of low resistance valves, improved soda lime canisters and low dead space connectors, the use of less complicated pediatric circle systems is gaining popularity to anesthetize children. There are bidirectional flow systems with carbon dioxide absorption. The Waters to and fro system, a classic example of bidirectional flow systems with a canister to absorb carbon dioxide, is valveless and portable. It was widely used in the past and now is only of historical importance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in German and EnglishSpontaneous {{ventilation}} is {{a popular}} mode of ventilation for patients with the laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Studies have shown, however, that spontaneous ventilation impairs gas exchange and that assisting or controlling ventilation results in higher oxygen saturation. Atelectasis during general anesthesia is a well described mechanism which impacts on gas exchange. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) increases the lung volume available for gas exchange. This study investigated whether the application of PEEP leads to an improvement of oxygen saturation in unassisted spontaneously breathing patients with a LMA. A total of 80 adult patients under general anesthesia were prospectively randomized into two groups. Both groups were left to breathe spontaneously. In group 1 the adjustable <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> (APL) <b>valve</b> was opened resulting in zero end-expiratory pressure. In group 2 the valve was set to a PEEP of + 7 cm H 2 O. Oxygen saturation was measured by pulse oxymetry at four different phases: pre-induction, after induction and insertion of the LMA, during maintenance and in recovery. The application of PEEP did not improve oxygen saturation. In both groups the mean oxygen saturation was similar (97. 2 ± 1. 8 % in group 1 versus 97. 2 ± 1. 9 % in group 2, p= 0. 941) during maintenance. No effect on oxygen saturation in recovery could be found either (96. 0 ± 1. 8 % in group 1 versus 96. 1 ± 2. 0 % in group 2, p= 0. 952) and hemodynamics were unaffected by the application of PEEP. The application of a PEEP of + 7 cm H 2 O with a LMA under spontaneous ventilation cannot be recommended. Limitations of our study were the selection of healthy patients and omitting pre-oxygenation before induction which might have limited the development of atelectasis. In addition arterial partial pressure of oxygen (paO 2) measurements could have revealed subtle changes in oxygenation. B. Froessler, J. Brommundt, J. Anton, R. Khanduja, R. Kuhlen, R.

The current paper deals with the stress analysis of the pressure bulkhead at the rear end in the fuselage structure.
