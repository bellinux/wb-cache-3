50|$|As {{well as the}} Common Criteria standard, {{there is}} also a sub-treaty level Common Criteria MRA (Mutual <b>Recognition</b> <b>Arrangement),</b> whereby each party thereto recognizes {{evaluations}} against the Common Criteria standard done by other parties. Originally signed in 1998 by Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, Australia and New Zealand joined 1999, followed by Finland, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain in 2000. The Arrangement has since been renamed Common Criteria <b>Recognition</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (CCRA) and membership continues to expand. Within the CCRA only evaluations up to EAL 2 are mutually recognized (Including augmentation with flaw remediation). The European countries within the former ITSEC agreement typically recognize higher EALs as well. Evaluations at EAL5 and above tend to involve the security requirements of the host nation's government.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of IAF is two-fold. Firstly, to ensure that its {{accreditation}} body members only accredit bodies that are competent {{to do the work}} they undertake and are not subject to conflicts of interest. The second purpose of the IAF is to establish mutual <b>recognition</b> <b>arrangements,</b> known as Multilateral <b>Recognition</b> <b>Arrangements</b> (MLA), between its accreditation body members which reduces risk to business and its customers by ensuring that an accredited certificate may be relied upon anywhere in the world. The MLA contributes to the freedom of world trade by eliminating technical barriers to trade. IAF works to find the most effective way of achieving a single system that will allow companies with an accredited conformity assessment certificate {{in one part of the}} world, to have that certificate recognized else where in the world. The objective of the MLA is that it will cover all accreditation bodies in all countries in the world, thus eliminating the need for suppliers of products or services to be certified in each country where they sell their products or services. Certified once - accepted everywhere.|$|R

50|$|A {{national}} metrology institute's (NMI) {{role in a}} country's {{measurement system}} is to conduct scientific metrology, realise base units, and maintain primary national standards. An NMI provides traceability to international standards for a country, anchoring its national calibration hierarchy. For a national measurement system to be recognized internationally by the CIPM Mutual <b>Recognition</b> <b>Arrangement,</b> an NMI must participate in international comparisons of its measurement capabilities. The BIPM maintains a comparison database {{and a list of}} calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) of the countries participating in the CIPM MRA. Not all countries have a centralised metrology institute; some have a lead NMI and several decentralised institutes specialising in specific national standards.|$|E
5000|$|Inter{{national}} recognitionIn {{support of}} its national accreditation activities, SANAS is a founding signatory of the multilateral recognition arrangements {{of both the}} International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and International Accreditation Forum (IAF). These arrangements promote the global acceptance of technical test and calibration data, as well as certificates issued by certification bodies. In this regard, signatories to the ILAC and IAF arrangement are spread over 88 and 59 economies respectively. For South African trade, it implies the elimination of or reduction in the need for retesting or recertification to an importing country that is a signatory to the arrangement. In 2012, the multilateral <b>recognition</b> <b>arrangement</b> (MLRA) for inspection was officially launched under ILAC.

50|$|The {{arrangement}} was announced on 4 February 1973 and came into effect soon after. The arrangement is not {{expressed in the}} form of any binding bilateral treaty between Australia and New Zealand, but rather is a series of immigration procedures applied by each country and underpinned by joint political support. Although the exact nature of the arrangement has been varied from time to time, it still allows citizens of Australia or New Zealand to live in the other country indefinitely and take on most employment. New Zealand citizens who are not also Australian citizens may not work in Australia in areas involving national security or in the Australian Public Service. The arrangement itself is linked to and grounded by a system of other agreements and treaties such as the New Zealand Australia Free Trade Agreement (1966), Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (1983), Trans-Tasman Mutual <b>Recognition</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (1998), various Social Security agreements between Australia and New Zealand (1994, 1995, 1998 and 2002), Australia and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (2006), SmartGate (2007) and Trans-Tasman Patent Attorney Regime (2013).|$|E

Of this number of RAs, it is conservatively estimated that less than half (approx. 14,000) have valid licenses to practice i.e. a Registered and Licensed Architect (RLA) and that up to 50.0% of said RLAs may already working outside the country. The PRBoA also regulates {{the practice of}} foreign architects (FA) i.e. only as natural (not as juridical) persons, wishing {{to engage in the}} professional practice of architecture for any building project on Philippine soil for a limited period of time and of architectural firms (sole/single proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, associations and joint ventures). Only individual foreign architects/ FAs (not foreign architectural firms/ FAFs) are allowed to practice architecture in the Philippines together with counterpart Filipino RLAs and only if they are issued a special/ temporary permit (STP) in accordance with R.A.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that the ASEAN economic integration {{can be viewed as}} an opportunity for brain gain for the ASEAN member-countries. The envisaged ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) may boost both South-South and North-South movements of skilled labor {{as a result of the}} growth of cross-border education, increased mobility of professional workers with the implementation of the mutual <b>recognition</b> <b>arrangements,</b> and the possible return migration of expatriate professionals to the ASEAN region given a vibrant regional economy in the long run that can provide more competitive remuneration packages. In turn, these will facilitate knowledge exchanges and collaborations, technology transfers, economic and business linkages, investment flows, and increased remittances. However, the more advanced economies in the region will have an edge in exploiting these opportunities in the initial years of the AEC. The ASEAN integration can be a double-edged sword for member-countries that may not be able to improve their competitiveness in the long run...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{is motivated by}} the need for face recognition in uncontrolled environments. In other words, {{we are interested in}} face <b>recognition</b> <b>arrangements</b> whereby the users do not need to interact with the recognition technology. The contribution {{of this paper is to}} perform a range of recognition experiments on face image data as people casually enter a building, without any instructions about expression. Specifically, we capture four images per session in rapid succession (all within 20 ms). The four images are synchronised to different light sources to enable photometric stereo processing to estimate albedo images, surface normals and depth maps. Additional capture sessions then take place over periods of many weeks. Our recognition experiments are on each of the three modalities as well as a fusion technique for the albedo and depth. Using a variety of photometric stereo methods, surface integration methods (to recover depth) and recognition algorithms such as principal component analysis and nonnegative matrix factorisation, we acquire a maximum recognition rate of 86 % for 96 subjects...|$|R
