50|$|The term {{naval stores}} {{originally}} {{applied to the}} resin-based components used in building and maintaining wooden sailing ships, a category which includes cordage, mask, turpentine, <b>rosin,</b> <b>pitch</b> and tar.|$|E
50|$|Basilicon, or basilicum, is {{the name}} given to various ointments that were {{believed}} to have 'sovereign' virtues. One such example was an unguent composed of <b>rosin,</b> wax, <b>pitch,</b> and oil, which pre-modern surgeons used as a suppurative.|$|R
25|$|One such plan put the {{refugees}} {{to work in}} lands in the Hudson Valley, acquired from the Dutch a few decades earlier, producing naval stores. However the mostly tropical plants that produced tar, <b>rosin</b> and <b>pitch</b> did not endure well in the region's harsh winters, and {{after a year or}} two the plan was abandoned. The settlers remained, and took note of the fertile farmlands available in New York. Some moved to other regions of the colony, but others remained in the area they had been brought to along the east bank of the Hudson in what is now the northwest corner of Dutchess County and southwestern Columbia County between Staatsburg and Germantown. They established farms amongst the local European colonial population, descended from Dutch and British settlers.|$|R
50|$|In January 1810 Armide, under Captain Hardyman, and the 80-gun second rate, HMS Christian VII, Captain Sir Joseph Sydney Yorke, were {{stationed}} off the Basque Roads. On 10 January, they sighted a small convoy sailing from the Île d'Aix to La Rochelle. The boats {{of the two}} ships went in under small arms and grapeshot fire from a shore battery and captured a chasse-maree of about 30 tons. The tide was ebbing too fast to bring off the other vessels so the British burnt a brig, a schooner and a chasse-maree. This was regrettable as the all were fully laden with cargoes consisting of best quality wines and brandies, soap, <b>rosin,</b> candles, <b>pitch,</b> oil, pine varnish, and the like. The cutting out expedition suffered no casualties. The captured chasse maree was probably the Felicite.|$|R

50|$|Typical {{applications}} include {{vacuum and}} atmospheric crude oil fractionators, FCC main fractionators and TEG contactors. The separation of mono-, di- and triethanolamine, conducted under vacuum, may also utilize structured packing, owing to its relatively low pressure drop.Tall oil fractionation, {{the process of}} separating fatty acids from <b>rosin</b> acids and <b>pitch</b> obtained as a by-product of the Kraft process of wood pulp manufacture, also utilizes structured packing. The packing additionally finds use {{in the manufacture of}} styrene monomer and the dehydration of glycol in natural gas processing.|$|R
5000|$|For {{traditional}} sailing ships, {{items that}} {{could be found in}} a chandlery might include <b>rosin,</b> turpentine, tar, <b>pitch</b> (resin), linseed oil, whale oil, tallow, lard, varnish, twine, rope and cordage, hemp, oakum, tools (hatchet, axe, hammer, chisel, planes, lantern, nail, spike, boat hook, caulking iron, hand pump, marlinspike), brooms, mops, galley supplies, leather goods, and paper. In the days of sail ship chandlers on remote islands, such as St. Helena, were responsible for delivering re-supplies of water and fresh produce (fruit and vegetables) to stave off scurvy. [...] The ship chandlery business was central to the existence and the social and political dynamics of ports and their waterfront areas.|$|R
60|$|And first, {{we shall}} find, that even Glass it self may, by {{the help of}} a Lamp, be blown thin enough to produce these Phænomena of Colours: which Phænomena accidentally happening, as I have been {{attempting}} to frame small Glasses with a Lamp, did not a little surprize me at first, having never heard or seen any thing of it before; though afterwards comparing it with the Phænomena, I had often observed in those Bubbles which Children use to make with Soap-water, I did the less wonder; especially when upon Experiment I found, I was able to produce the same Phænomena in thin Bubbles made with any other transparent Substance. Thus have I produced them with Bubbles of <b>Pitch,</b> <b>Rosin,</b> Colophony, Turpentine, Solutions of several Gums, as Gum-Arabick in water; any glutinous Liquor, as Wort, Wine, Spirit of Wine, Oyl of Turpentine, Glare of Snails, &c.|$|R
60|$|IT {{was always}} the custom for the boats to leave New Orleans between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. From three o'clock onward they would be burning <b>rosin</b> and <b>pitch</b> pine (the sign of preparation), and so one had the picturesque {{spectacle}} of a rank, some two or three miles long, of tall, ascending columns of coal-black smoke; a colonnade which supported a sable roof of the same smoke blended together and spreading abroad over the city. Every outward-bound boat had its flag flying at the jack-staff, and sometimes a duplicate on the verge staff astern. Two or three miles of mates were commanding and swearing with more than usual emphasis; countless processions of freight barrels and boxes were spinning athwart the levee and flying aboard the stage-planks, belated passengers were dodging and skipping among these frantic things, hoping to reach the forecastle companion way alive, but having their doubts about it; women with reticules and bandboxes were {{trying to keep up}} with husbands freighted with carpet-sacks and crying babies, and making a failure of it by losing their heads in the whirl and roar and general distraction; drays and baggage-vans were clattering hither and thither in a wild hurry, every now and then getting blocked and jammed together, and then during ten seconds one could not see them for the profanity, except vaguely and dimly; every windlass connected with every forehatch, from one end of that long array of steamboats to the other, was keeping up a deafening whiz and whir, lowering freight into the hold, and the half-naked crews of perspiring negroes that worked them were roaring such songs as 'De Las' Sack! De Las' Sack!'--inspired to unimaginable exaltation by the chaos of turmoil and racket that was driving everybody else mad. By this time the hurricane and boiler decks of the steamers would be packed and black with passengers. The 'last bells' would begin to clang, all down the line, and then the powwow seemed to double; in a moment or two the final warning came,--a simultaneous din of Chinese gongs, with the cry, 'All dat ain't goin', please to git asho'!'--and behold, the powwow quadrupled! People came swarming ashore, overturning excited stragglers that were trying to swarm aboard. One more moment later a long array of stage-planks was being hauled in, each with its customary latest passenger clinging to the end of it with teeth, nails, and everything else, and the customary latest procrastinator making a wild spring shoreward over his head.|$|R
