5|$|A {{limitation}} of the <b>radial</b> <b>velocity</b> method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on the inclination of the orbit, which is not determined by the <b>radial</b> <b>velocity</b> measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E

The orbital period of Gliese 876 c was found to be exactly half that of the outer planet, which meant that the <b>radial</b> <b>velocity</b> signature of the second planet was initially interpreted as a higher eccentricity of the orbit of Gliese 876 b.|$|E

40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} {{the determination of}} absolute stellar <b>radial</b> <b>velocities</b> from geometrical principles, i. e. using astrometry. Such `astrometric radial velocities' are obtained independently of spectroscopic information. While spectroscopic <b>radial</b> <b>velocities</b> are affected by line shifts from astrophysical processes on the stellar surfaces, by gravitational redshift and various other effects, astrometric <b>radial</b> <b>velocities</b> are not. Comparison between {{these two types of}} <b>radial</b> <b>velocities</b> therefore makes it possible to study certain stellar phenomena if the accuracies are good enough. Astrometric <b>radial</b> <b>velocities</b> of sufficient accuracy have indeed come within reach for stars in the Hyades cluster and a few more moving clusters, thanks to the space astrometry mission Hipparcos. The thesis consists of two parts. The first gives a brief background and explanation of the method used to derive astrometric <b>radial</b> <b>velocities,</b> and highlights some of the results. The second part consists of six research papers briefly summarised below. In Papers I and II some early results and expectations are outlined. It is demonstrated that the parallaxes for the cluster stars are considerable improved by the method. The expected effects when comparing astrometric and spectroscopic <b>radial</b> <b>velocities</b> are described. Papers III, IV and V give a systematic exploration of the concept of astrometric <b>radial</b> <b>velocities</b> and their determination in practice. In Paper III, various possibilities for their current and future determination are discussed. Only in nearby open clusters OB associations is it possible to reach accuracies at the sub-km/s level with available astrometric data. In Paper IV the kinematic cluster modelling is further developed and described in detail. Possible biases are investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. The Hyades is used as an example in applying the method. Paper V presents results in the form of astrometric <b>radial</b> <b>velocities</b> and improved parallaxes for stars in five open clusters and five OB associations. In Paper VI, extensive Monte Carlo modelling of the Hyades cluster and its observation by Hipparcos is used to study the internal velocity dispersion and how it affects the accuracy of astrometric <b>radial</b> <b>velocities</b> obtained in Paper V. For the dynamic modelling of the cluster, the N-body code NBODY 6 is used, including stellar evolution. The minimum internal standard error of the astrometric <b>radial</b> <b>velocities</b> is set by the velocity dispersion at around 0. 2 km/s, while the total standard error, including the uncertainty of the bulk cluster motion, is around 0. 6 km/s...|$|R
