Starting from the well-known Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) contact description, we derive an analytical theory for the {{rolling friction}} based {{on the concept of}} adhesion hysteresis, e. g. a difference in apparent surface energies for opening/closing cracks. We show how adhesion hysteresis causes the pressure distribution within the contact to become asymmetrical, leading to an opposing torque. Analytical expressions are derived relating the size of the hysteresis, the rolling torque, and the rolling displacement, ξ. We confirm the existence of a critical rolling displacement for the onset of rolling, the size of which is set by the amount of adhesion hysteresis {{and the size of the}} contact area.

40|$|Tyres are a {{final output}} torque {{of the vehicle}} before all the forces are {{distributed}} to the road surface as a tractive force. When the tyre pressure changed, it had a direct effect on <b>rolling</b> resistance <b>force</b> of the vehicle and reduced the tractive force. Moreover, it {{had an effect on}} a rate of fuel consumption and driving comfort. This research had tested the effect of tyre pressure of 25 psi and 45 psi to determine the total resistance force between the vehicle speed from 40 km/hr to 100 km/hr and compare with the reference tyre pressure of 35 psi by using the “coast-down technique”. The results from calculation showed the total resistance force when the vehicle speed was zero from tyre pressure of 25 psi increased by 48. 52 % from reference value and the total resistance force from tyre pressure of 45 psi decreased by 13. 46 % from the reference tyre pressure. The different resistance force from tyre pressure of 35 psi with the other 2 values of tyre pressure in the research were called the different <b>rolling</b> resistance <b>force</b> because the vehicle changed only tyre pressure which had no effect on aerodynamics drag. The relationship of the different <b>rolling</b> resistance <b>force</b> along the test speed from tyre pressure of 25 psi and 45 psi decreased while the vehicle speed increased. The relationship can be fitted with a linear equation. The slope from tyre pressure of 25 psi was 0. 2358 which was steeper than the slope of 0. 0828 from 45 psi tyre pressure. These were the effect of tyre characteristic that made from rubber. When the vehicle speed was low, the frequency of tyre deformation was also low and resulted in high energy loss from hysteresis phenomena. Therefore high <b>rolling</b> resistance <b>force</b> was generated. Considering the effect of tyre under high vehicle speed, the frequency of tyre deformation increased and made the molecule of rubber vibrate more than low vehicle speed. These effects made the tyre stiffer than low frequency and resulted in decreasing the <b>rolling</b> resistance <b>force.</b> In additional, high frequency that caused by high tyre pressure had effected on driving comfort in a real driving condition...|$|R

40|$|Adhesion forces between submicrometer-sized {{silicate}} grains play {{a crucial}} role in the formation of silicate dust agglomerates, rocky planetesimals, and terrestrial planets. The surface energy of silicate dust particles is the key to their adhesion and <b>rolling</b> <b>forces</b> in a theoretical model based on the contact mechanics. Here we revisit the cohesion of amorphous silica spheres by compiling available data on the surface energy for hydrophilic amorphous silica in various circumstances. It turned out that the surface energy for hydrophilic amorphous silica in a vacuum is a factor of 10 higher than previously assumed. Therefore, the previous theoretical models underestimated the critical velocity for the sticking of amorphous silica spheres, as well as the <b>rolling</b> friction <b>forces</b> between them. With the most plausible value of the surface energy for amorphous silica spheres, theoretical models based on the contact mechanics are in harmony with laboratory experiments. Consequently, we conclude that silicate grains with a radius of 0. 1 μm could grow to planetesimals via coagulation in a protoplanetary disk. We argue that the coagulation growth of silicate grains in a molecular cloud is advanced either by organic mantles rather than icy mantles or, if there are no mantles, by nanometer-sized grain radius.

40|$|To {{create new}} types of cars, raise their reliability, gain {{operational}} life, and decrease in metal consumption of products {{it is necessary to}} improve mechanical, physical, and also special properties of the constructional materials applied in mechanical engineering. Presently, there are intensive researches and developments under way to create materials with ultrafine-grained structure (the sizes of grains in their crystal lattice make less than 1 micron in one of the measurements). BMSTU developed a manufacturing technology of multilayer steel sheets with steady ultrafine-grained structure based on the multiple hot rolling of billet as a composition consisting of the alternating metal sheets. A principled condition for implementation of such technology is existence of different crystallographic modifications in the adjoining sheets of the composition at specified temperature of rolling. Power parameters of rolling are important technical characteristics of the process. Usually, to determine a deformation resistance value when rolling the diverse multilayer materials, is used the actual resistance value averaging in relation to the components of the composition. The aim of this work is a comparative analysis of known calculated dependences with experimental data when rolling the 100 -layer samples. Objects of research were the 100 -layer compositions based on the alternating layers of steel 08 H 18 N 10 and U 8. Experimental samples represented the vacuumized capsules with height, width, and length of 53 mm x 53 mm x 200 mm, respectively, in which there were the 100 -layer packs from sheets, each of 0. 5 mm, based on the composition of steels (U 8 + 08 H 18 N 10). Rolling was made on the double-high mill with rolls of 160 mm in diameter during 19 passes to the thickness of 7 mm with the speed of 0, 1 m/s. Relative sinking in each pass was accepted to be equal 10 ± 2, 5 %. Rolling forces were measured by the strain-gauging method using the measuring cells, located under press screws of the mill. The oven thermocouple controlled a rolling temperature, and two pyrometers Optris CTlaser 3 MH 3 at the input and output parts of the mill made records. Comparison of the <b>rolling</b> <b>forces</b> of the multilayer composition U 8 + 08 H 18 N 10, which were received during experiment, with the calculated values, shows that with accumulative nature of deformations the real <b>forces</b> of <b>rolling</b> 1. 5 – 2 times exceed the calculated values.
