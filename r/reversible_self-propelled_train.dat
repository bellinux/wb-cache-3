5000|$|Two bogies or wheel {{assemblies}} {{under the}} unit. Each bogie has two powered axles, connected by driving rods or gears. Three-quarters of all modern locomotives (and power cars of <b>self-propelled</b> <b>trains)</b> are configured in either this or the [...] "Bo′Bo′" [...] arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|Two bogies or wheel {{assemblies}} {{under the}} unit. Each bogie has two powered axles individually driven by traction motors. Three-quarters of all modern locomotives (and power cars of <b>self-propelled</b> <b>trains)</b> are configured in either this or the [...] "B′B′" [...] arrangement. Many types of tram use this arrangement. See also: Bo-Bo.|$|R
50|$|Multiple units (MU) are <b>self-propelled</b> <b>train</b> {{carriages}} {{capable of}} coupling with other {{units of the}} {{same or similar type}} and still being controlled from one driving cab. Often these are passenger trainsets consisting of more than one carriage. Single self-propelling carriages (also called railcars, rail motor coaches or railbuses) are multiple units if capable of operating with other units.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, the Through Mail was {{replaced}} by a <b>self-propelled</b> diesel <b>train</b> and the Brewarrina Mixed train operated only twice each week.|$|R
5000|$|As the post-2000 Hungarian {{political}} establishment became very much {{focused on the}} perceived [...] "autobahn-gap" [...] compared to better-routed Slovakia and especially Croatia and decided to upgrade the highway-system, {{there was no significant}} domestic funding for developing the Hungarian Railway especially for the small regional lines. Recent developments include the purchase of twelve Siemens Desiro diesel railbuses for commuter routes and the order for Swiss Stadler Flirts, a type of very advanced electric <b>self-propelled</b> <b>train</b> for medium range shuttle paths, which is mired in a selection scandal against Bombardier's more established, but conservatively engineered Talent trains.|$|R
50|$|A 3.4 km {{section of}} the Murwillumbah railway line is to be rehabilitated in 2016 for a two car <b>self-propelled</b> diesel <b>train</b> planned to run from the town centre to the Elements of Byron resort and nearby attractions.|$|R
50|$|A two car passenger-train {{provides}} railbus service besides daily round-trip service between Seton Portage and Lillooet, stopping also in Shalalth, {{limited service}} farther {{south to the}} Ponderosa Ranch (near D'Arcy) and may be chartered to run past the Ponderosa Ranch to D'Arcy, which is forty-five minutes north of Pemberton {{at the head of}} Anderson Lake. Note: there are often minor delays by mountain goats and/or bighorn sheep. They scatter for the CN's freight-trains but show no fear of the two-car <b>self-propelled</b> passenger <b>train.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Xplorer is {{a diesel}} <b>self-propelled</b> {{multiple}} unit <b>train,</b> introduced from 1993. They {{provide services to}} Canberra, Griffith, Moree, Armidale and Broken Hill. They are technically and mechanically similar to NSW TrainLink's Endeavour railcars, but with a buffet service and {{a higher standard of}} accommodation.|$|R
2500|$|Since the Second World War, it {{has seen}} {{a wide variety of}} service as towed and <b>self-propelled</b> artillery, a <b>training</b> and a {{headquarters}} unit, and latterly as a precision fire battery. [...] It has been based in Germany as part of the BAOR, Malaysia, Northern Ireland (Operation Banner), the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq.|$|R
5000|$|These <b>self-propelled</b> diesel {{passenger}} <b>trains</b> {{were introduced}} in 1937 and operated between Parkes and Broken Hill. During World War II, they were also used on some intercity runs from Sydney to Canberra and Newcastle. Together with Victorian Railway's [...] "Spirit of Progress", {{it was the first}} air-conditioned train in the British Empire.|$|R
2500|$|Since the Second World War, it {{has seen}} {{a wide variety of}} service as towed and <b>self-propelled</b> artillery, a <b>training</b> unit, and latterly as an Aviation Tactical Group. [...] It has been based in Germany as part of the BAOR, Malaysia and Borneo (Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation) and Afghanistan (Operation Herrick). [...] In May 2013 it was placed in {{suspended}} animation.|$|R
40|$|The ILC {{requires}} an unprecedented accuracy and speed for {{the survey and}} alignment of its components. The Rapid Tunnel Reference Surveyor (RTRS) is a <b>self-propelled</b> survey <b>train,</b> intended to automatically survey a reference network in the ILC tunnels with a design accuracy of 200 (500) microns vertical (horizontal) over each 600 m segment [1]. A prototype RTRS has been built by the LiCAS collaboration. It will shortly commence operation at DESY. The operation principle and expected performance of the RTRS will be explained. The status of the project {{as well as the}} principles and performance of the underlying measurement technique will be described.

50|$|From 1940 to 1959 Cuba's {{railway system}} was modernized by the {{acquisition}} of train stock from Budd and Fiat. These trains provided medium speed <b>self-propelled</b> (diesel) four-car <b>trains</b> service on the main line between Havana and Santiago de Cuba. Also after World War II a large network of diesel intercity buses was created with four or five major carriers competing in the east-west corridor between Havana and the provinces to the east. After the revolution with the nationalization of the transportation system, the diversion of resources to defense expenditures {{and the lack of}} competition for the service, the train stock slowly deteriorated; this coupled with the inability to obtain replacement parts from the US that had been the main supplier of the equipment for decades destroyed the once efficient system.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{sweet corn}} cultivars {{arose in the}} nineteenth century when a single gene mutated in field corn. Plants descended from this mutant had kernels with a sugary, rather than a starchy, {{endosperm}} and a creamy texture. Sweet corn also has a thinner seed coat than field corn, making it more tender. Within the last 20 years, sweet corn breeders have introduced new genes through traditional methods that further increase kernel sugar content and extend shelf life. Florida ranks number one nationally in the production and value of fresh market sweet corn, typically accounting for 25 % of both national sweet corn production and of U. S. cash receipts for fresh sales [1]. A total of 548 million pounds of fresh sweet corn valued at $ 100 million was produced on 40, 000 acres in Florida during the 1998 - 1999 season [2]. Typically, total production costs for a sweet corn crop in Florida are approximately $ 3, 000 per acre [4]. The crop is usually hand picked with picking, packing and hauling costs representing approximately 10 % of the per acreage costs. Insecticides are estimated to cost $ 201 per acre with associated costs of aerial spraying of $ 38 per acre. With hand harvesting, there is more in-field selection for marketable ears. <b>Self-propelled</b> packinghouses (mule <b>trains)</b> with conveyers for hand harvested ears are used extensively in cor...|$|R
