5|$|Another {{change was}} the {{transition}} to the use of judges as the electoral returning officer for South Australia. This was done to impose state control on a system which had effectively combined the administration of the national and state electoral <b>rolls.</b> <b>On</b> 27 May 1925, Denny arranged the appointment of Judge Herbert Kingsley Paine of the Insolvency Court to be appointed as Electoral Officer for the state, replacing Charles Mathews, a state public servant who had held the position since 1907. Denny had previously worked for Paine as a legal associate.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old; {{production}} of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months. However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. Oestrus, one to three days long, recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant. Females in oestrus show a spike in urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; limited number of observations suggest that copulation, that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, who <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> the ground. Following this he approaches and mounts the female. The pair separate after copulation.|$|E

25|$|Coins {{can also}} be spun {{on a flat surface}} such as a table. This results in the {{following}} phenomenon: as the coin falls over and <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> its edge, it spins faster and faster (formally, the precession rate of the symmetry axis of the coin, i.e., the axis passing from one face of the coin to the other) before coming to an abrupt stop. This is mathematically modeled as a finite-time singularity – the precession rate is accelerating to infinity, before it suddenly stops, and has been studied using high speed photography and devices such as Euler's Disk. The slowing down is predominantly caused by rolling friction (air resistance is minor), and the singularity (divergence of the precession rate) can be modeled as a power law with exponent approximately −1/3.|$|E

25|$|The bounce of an oval-shaped ball (such {{as those}} used in {{gridiron}} football or rugby football) is in general much less predictable than the bounce of a spherical ball. Depending on the ball's alignment at impact, the normal force can act ahead or behind the centre of mass of the ball, and friction from the ground {{will depend on the}} alignment of the ball, as well as its rotation, spin, and impact velocity. Where the forces act with respect to the centre of mass of the ball changes as the ball <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> the ground, and all forces can exert a torque on the ball, including the normal force and the force of gravity. This can cause the ball to bounce forward, bounce back, or sideways. Because it is possible to transfer some rotational kinetic energy into translational kinetic energy, it is even possible for the COR to be greater than 1, or for the forward velocity of the ball to increase upon impact.|$|E
25|$|As {{elections}} have fixed four-year terms, the election date of 18 March 2006 was known {{well ahead of}} time. The Electoral Act stipulates that the election is to be held on the third Saturday in March every four years.

On 20 February, Premier Mike Rann invited Governor Marjorie Jackson-Nelson to issue writs for the election. In accordance with electoral regulations, the Electoral Commissioner then advertised key dates for the election of the House of Assembly and half of the Legislative Council – close of <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> 27 February 2006 at noon, nominations to be received by 2 March 2006 at noon, polling day on 18 March 2006, and the return of writs on or before 28 April 2006.|$|E

The mountain's previous rides had all been removed several years previously, and Volcano gave the mountain a major transformation. Volcano, which was manufactured by Intamin, was the world's first LIM-launched inverted roller coaster. The ride featured two separate launch sections, an Immelman loop {{out of the top}} of the mountain, and three heartline <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> the way back down. Volcano was themed to the 1997 film Volcano; the other Paramount Parks added inverted or suspended roller coasters themed to Top Gun around the same time. During the next two seasons, Kings Dominion expanded Hurricane Reef behind the Rebel Yell and renamed it WaterWorks. The new portion of WaterWorks includes Pipeline Peak, a set of four enclosed water slides, one of which (the Night Slider) is the world's tallest dark free-fall slide. In 2000, Nick Central opened, replacing Nick Splat City and part of Kidzville.|$|E

[...] In fact, Schulz's father was a successful doctor, and contemporary reports indicate that Schulz was ineligible to play in 1906 for academic reasons. [...] In February 1906, one paper reported that Schulz had been [...] "dropped from the <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> account of poor work during the semester". [...] Another report in March 1906 indicated that Schulz had left the university [...] "by desire of the faculty" [...] after he fell behind in his studies. [...] In September 1906, The Washington Post reported that Schulz's academic problems continued to render him ineligible to play.|$|E

His confidential report from 1838 commended his [...] "great zeal and application", and he was highly popular within the regiment, rising to become the senior lieutenant. Despite this, {{his status as a}} foreigner and a commoner limited his opportunities for promotion. Although promotions in the Austrian Army theoretically were merit-based, in practise the gentry exchanged favours and money unofficially to secure them. Nolan's father attempted to get him a commission with the British Army, [...] with little success until Nolan's return to the United Kingdom for the coronation of Queen Victoria in July 1838. While there, he secured an interview with Lord Fitzroy Somerset while his father negotiated with the Austrian General Clam-Gallas to permit Nolan to leave the Austrian armed forces. Eventually, following the payment of £450, Nolan was granted a commission as a Cornet in the 15th Light Dragoons of the British Army on 23 April 1839. His resignation from the Austrian army was never formally accepted, and he was struck off the <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> 31 October 1899, 45 years after his death.|$|E

[...] A review in Variety by Todd McCarthy was critical: [...] "Apart from startling, out-there comic turns by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise, however, the antics here are pretty thin, redundant and one-note."
