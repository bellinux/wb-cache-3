50|$|In 2004, Rake's solo {{exhibition}} My Address {{is neither a}} House nor a Street, My Address is a Shopping Center, {{which was one of}} the exhibitions in the cycle Emission 2004 at the CAC, marked another shift in the artist's oeuvre; video and audio works here were recordings of enacted or suggested interventions into the <b>routine</b> <b>proceedings</b> of everyday life.|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} of Vice President {{was created in}} 1909, with a second Vice President being added in 1973 and a third in 1999. Currently, two Vice Presidents are elected from the ruling party (or coalition) and one from the opposition. They are elected by their colleagues {{at the beginning of}} a legislature, and serve until a successor is elected. The Vice President assists the President of the Assembly, and can replace the President in the case of their absence. The Vice Presidents generally preside over <b>routine</b> <b>proceedings.</b> They rarely take part in debate, although they can still cast votes. The current Vice Presidents of the Assembly are Liberals Francois Ouimet and Maryse Gaudreault and péquiste Francois Gendron.|$|E
40|$|When Nazi {{leadership}} ultimately {{embraced the}} notion of hosting the 1936 Summer Olympic Games in Berlin, the decision entailed an undertaking to which an inherently militaristic society would seem ill-suited: orchestrating an opening ceremony, a celebration grounded in the principles of peace and harmony, that could withstand the scrutiny of a leery global audience. Through a dynamic approach that steeped the ceremony's <b>routine</b> <b>proceedings</b> in rich symbolic gestures, the Nazis' audition {{on the international stage}} generally succeeded in establishing an outwardly benign atmosphere. However, a thorough appraisal reveals that the regime could not bring itself to fully suppress its martial disposition, which consequentially colored a number of the day's events...|$|E
5000|$|Although Manx is {{commonly}} used for written slogans by local businesses and appears on department letterheads and promotional materials within the Isle of Man government, it is not used as a spoken language within the business community, or spoken within the government. A token few words are used in <b>routine</b> debates and <b>proceedings</b> of the Keys, the Council and Tynwald Court, as may be verified by reference to Hansard. The Standing Orders of the House of Keys, for example, provide: ...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{lawyers and}} judges in the Nevada legal {{community}} regarded it as a case of selective prosecution. Swanson said that had Conforte not been brought in to testify against Claiborne {{and give him a}} bad name, the IRS would have resolved the judge's tax problems through <b>routine</b> civil <b>proceedings.</b> Claiborne long maintained he was too busy on the bench to pay close attention to his tax return, noting he never even looked at the document until his accountant brought it to him. [...] "I asked how much I owed, and I wrote a check." [...] According to Nevada State District Judge Michael Cherry in 2004, [...] "He was very, very fair to criminal defendants to his detriment. I think that is why the government was so interested in prosecuting him and knocking him off the bench." ...|$|R
50|$|The New York City {{critics were}} less enamored {{with the show}} than their Detroit {{counterparts}} had been, and without a strong directorial hand to keep him under control, Hackett soon began ignoring the script and breaking character to inject his own <b>routines</b> into the <b>proceedings,</b> especially to defend the show from reviews. Despite mixed reviews, positive word-of-mouth, linked with one night cameos made by several of Hackett's friends during a tunnel of love sequence such as Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop, and Steve Lawrence caused {{an increase in the}} box office. However, competition from heavy-hitters like Fiddler on the Roof, Hello, Dolly! and Funny Girl, plus Hackett demanding to be released from his contract without a replacement ready ultimately led to an early closing.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the sexual transmission of GBV-C/HGV, through RNA detection in cervicovaginal smears. Therefore the GBV-C/HGV RNA in cervicovaginal smears from apparently healthy women was investigated using <b>routine</b> <b>proceedings</b> for prophylactic screening to cervical cancer. GBV-C/HGV RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Only one woman presented co-infection with human papilloma virus (HPV). The GBV-C/HGV RNA was detected in 13 / 73 (17. 57 %) healthy women and it's prevalence in participating women between 28 - 43 years old was 53. 85 %. No association was found with GBV-C/HGV for the age of first sexual intercourse and number of pregnancies. In GBV-C/HGV RNA positive women, 69. 23 % were married. In conclusion, the present findings show that cervical and vaginal specimens could contain the GBV-C/HGV RNA...|$|E

In conclusion, the present findings show that cervical and vaginal specimens could contain the GBV-C/HGV RNA. O objetivo do presente estudo foi avaliar a transmissão sexual de GBV-C/HBV, através da detecção do RNA viral em raspados cérvico-vaginais. Portanto, a presença do RNA GBV-C/HGV foi investigada em raspados cérvico-vaginais em mulheres aparentemente saudáveis que realizaram exames preventivos para câncer cervical. GBV-C/HGV RNA foi detectado por reação de transcriptase reversa e reação em cadeia da polimerase (RT-PCR). Apenas uma mulher apresentou a co-infecção com o papiloma vírus humano (HPV). O RNA GBV-C/HGV foi detectado em 13 / 73 (17, 57 %) mulheres saudáveis e sua prevalência entre participantes da idade de 28 - 43 anos foi de 53, 85 %. Não foi observada relação entre a presença do RNA GBV-C/HGV com a idade de primeira relação sexual, nem com o número de gestações. Entre as mulheres que apresentavam o RNA viral, 69, 23 % eram casadas. O presente estudo demonstrou que secreções cérvico-vaginais podem conter o RNA viral GBV-C/HBV...|$|E
