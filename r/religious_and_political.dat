5|$|According to the British Museum, the Cyrus Cylinder {{reflects}} {{a long tradition}} in Mesopotamia where, from {{as early as the}} third millennium BC, kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms. Cyrus's declaration stresses his legitimacy as the king, and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for the <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> traditions of Babylon. The British Museum and scholars of the period describe it as an instrument of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda.|$|E

5|$|An ancient carved {{slab of slate}} {{depicting}} {{an animal}} {{very similar to the}} blue wildebeest has been discovered. Dating back to around 3000 BC, it was found in Hierakonopolis (Nekhen), which used to be the <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> capital of Upper Egypt at that time. This may be evidence that the animal used to occur in North Africa and was associated with the ancient Egyptians.|$|E

Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity. The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue in the <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> conditions of the present world.|$|E
5|$|The decorations were in wood, stucco and stone, {{including}} marble, with geometrical and floral {{patterns and}} arabesques with Samarran and Byzantine origins. The decorations were {{more complex than}} the earlier Islamic forms and more carefully adapted to structural constraints. The imposing architecture and decoration of Fatimid buildings such as the al-Hakim mosque provided a backdrop that supported the dual role of the Fatimid caliph as both <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> leader.|$|E

5|$|Greek mythology is {{the body}} of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, {{concerning}} their gods and heroes, {{the nature of the}} world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices.

Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> institutions of ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1743 the Cameronians {{established}} {{themselves as}} the Reformed Presbyterian Church, remaining largely separate from <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> debate. Of independent churches from England that were established {{in the seventeenth century}} only the Quakers managed to endure in to the eighteenth century. Baptist chapels were re-established {{in the middle of the}} century and, although Scotland initially appeared fertile ground for Methodism, it failed to expand as quickly as elsewhere in the Great Britain and Ireland. A number of minor Scottish sects developed, such as the Bereans, Buchanites, Daleites and Glassites.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevići clan, a Muslim, walked next to {{the cross}} with a flag in his left and a knife in his right hand, ready to use it if anyone {{attempted}} to take the cross. The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the procession dropped as their <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> leaders disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the procession was not held between 1959 and 1984.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the first}} ten years of the society's existence, the {{organization}} grew in membership and held meetings {{at least twice a}} month, and usually four times a month. The society debated an extensive range of subjects including scientific, religious, political, and social topics, often violating the constitution's rules banning <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> subjects. The society's debates were often acrimonious and regularly spilled beyond the confines of the meetings and into the community. Between January 30, 1819 and January 22, 1830, the society's membership rolls reached 52 members; although as few as 15 members attended the bimonthly meetings, and no more than 17 members were ever present at a meeting.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} of the Archbishop of Cologne to Protestantism also triggered <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> repercussions throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Gebhard's conversion had widespread implications {{for the future of}} the Holy Roman Empire's electoral process, established by the Golden Bull of 1356. The council continued for more than a year, and eventually moved to other cities; although several times they seemed close to negotiating a conclusion to the crisis, a successful agreement remained beyond their reach. They also offered Gebhard a sum of money to relinquish his claim, which he refused on the high moral grounds of religious principle.|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s Abd al-Rahman was a {{respected}} <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> leader. In 1921 {{he held a}} meeting at his home where the attendees signed two documents that laid out the Mahdist objectives. These were for Sudan to be ruled by Britain rather than Egypt, and for Sudan to eventually achieve self-government. In the early 1920s, between 5,000 and 15,000 pilgrims were coming to Aba Island each year to celebrate Ramadan. Many of them identified Abd al-Rahman with Isa, the prophet Jesus, and assumed that he would drive the Christian colonists out of Sudan. The British found that Abd al-Rahman was in correspondence with agents and leaders in Nigeria and Cameroon, predicting the eventual victory of the Mahdists over the Christians. They blamed him for unrest in these colonies. After pilgrims from West Africa held mass demonstrations on Aba Island in 1924, Abd al-Rahman was told {{to put a stop}} to the pilgrimages.|$|E
5|$|In the Halo {{science fiction}} universe, the Arbiter is a ceremonial, <b>religious,</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> rank {{bestowed}} upon alien Covenant Elites. In the 2004 video game Halo 2, the rank {{is given to}} a disgraced commander {{as a way to}} atone for his failures. Although the Arbiter is intended to die serving the Covenant leadership, the High Prophets, he survives his missions and the Prophets' subsequent betrayal of his kind. When he learns that the Prophets' plans would doom all sentient life in the galaxy to extinction, the Arbiter allies with the Covenant's enemies—humanity—and stops the ringworld Halo from being activated. The Arbiter is a playable character in Halo2 and its 2007 sequel Halo 3; a different Arbiter appears in the 2009 real-time strategy game Halo Wars, which takes place 20years before the events of the main trilogy.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival in Maryland, Carroll {{presented}} his commission to the colony's council and was recognized as the new Attorney General of the colony. He arrived in a place already riven by religious and class differences. Carroll and nearly the entire governing structure of the colony, {{with the exception of}} the lower house of the proprietary assembly, were appointed by Calvert. Most of the appointees were Catholic and wealthy, whereas the majority of the population and the lower house of the assembly were Protestant and less wealthy. Carroll arrived in Maryland just as long-standing economic, <b>religious,</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> tensions between the poorer Protestant majority and the wealthier and more powerful Catholic minority were reaching a head.|$|E
