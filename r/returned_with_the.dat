5|$|The {{first of}} the brigade's glider units, forty Waco gliders {{carrying}} the 64th Airlanding Light Battery Royal Artillery and their 75mm pack howitzers, landed at 09:20. The thirty-five larger Horsa gliders, transporting the 300th Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery and its equipment, failed to arrive, turning back to Italy due to an overcast sky at the landing zone. The Horsas <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> afternoon's second wave landing at 15:04.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short period}} of rest, the {{breakout}} began on 6 December with the 7th Marines as the vanguard of the retreating column while the 5th Marines covered the rear. At the same time, the much-delayed PVA 26th Corps arrived at Hagaru-ri with its 76th and 77th Division relieving the 58th and 60th Divisions. As the 7th Marines pushed aside the PVA 76th Division south of Hagaru-ri, the 5th Marines took over the Hagaru-ri perimeter and recaptured the East Hill from the 76th Division. In a last effort to stop the breakout, the customary Chinese night attack <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 76th and 77th Division striking the Hagaru-ri perimeter from all directions. The Marines repulsed the Chinese attacks, inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{accompanied}} the First Corps to northern Georgia {{in the fall}} of 1863 to reinforce Gen. Braxton Bragg for the Battle of Chickamauga. He personally arrived too late to participate in the battle, but served as Longstreet's chief of artillery in the subsequent Knoxville Campaign and in the Department of East Tennessee in early 1864. He <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> corps to Virginia {{for the remainder of the}} war, now with the rank of brigadier general (as of February 26, 1864). He served in all the battles of the Overland Campaign, and when Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant slipped around Lee's army to cross the James River and assault Petersburg, Alexander was able to move his guns quickly through the lines, emplacing them to repel the main attack.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{stability}} <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> U.S. {{entry into}} World War II in 1941, when {{demand for the}} state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war. In 1944, the Pick–Sloan Plan was passed {{as part of the}} Flood Control Act of 1944 by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially in South Dakota. Flood control, hydroelectricity, and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|Having toured {{with his}} {{brothers}} since the early 1970s, Michael Jackson began his first solo world tour on September 12, 1987, in Tokyo, Japan. Attracting over 4million people, including royalty, the Bad tour proved to be successful, becoming the most-highly attended and highest-earning tour of all time. The follow-up concert series—the Dangerous World Tour of 19921993—was also attended by millions. In 1996, Jackson <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> HIStory World Tour, an 82 run of concerts that concluded the following year. The tour was attended by more than 4.5 million fans.|$|E

5|$|In November 1945 it <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 509th Composite Group to Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico, {{where it}} {{remained}} {{for the rest}} of its flying career, except for a brief period when it was assigned to Task Force 1.5 for Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in July 1946. It returned to the 509th, now designated the 509th Bombardment Group, in September. On 3 September 1948, during a polar navigation training mission, it developed an engine problem after takeoff from Goose Bay Air Base, Labrador, and ran off the end of the runway when attempting to land. Heavily damaged, it never flew again, and was eventually scrapped at Goose Bay in September 1949, despite its historical significance.|$|E
5|$|Poniatowski was {{involved}} in Commonwealth politics, and was a prominent member of the Familia, a faction led by the Czartoryski family. On {{a number of occasions}} he was in service of Stanisław I Leszczyński, the principal rival of Augustus II for the throne of Poland. Having served under Leszczyński as a military officer and envoy during the Great Northern War, Poniatowski later embraced the Russian-supported Augustus. Subsequently, during the War of the Polish Succession, he <b>returned,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> majority of the Familia, to his earlier allegiance. He later effected a reconciliation with Augustus III, and eventually became one of the new king's chief advisors.|$|E

5|$|SpiceJet {{began the}} same Mysore–Bangalore–Chennai route in January 2013. The airline {{suspended}} the service in July 2014 {{because of low}} passenger traffic. After speaking with local stakeholders and members of government, SpiceJet returned to Mysore for brief periods of time before finally cancelling all services in October of the same year. Service <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Air India Regional in September 2015; the operation was subsidised by the state government. The airline's Bangalore flights had extremely low passenger loads, which some passengers attributed to the inconvenient timings. Air India ended the service two months later when the subsidy arrangement expired.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian lords dethroned Peter in 1041 {{and elected}} Samuel king. According to the {{unanimous}} narration of the Hungarian chronicles, Samuel preferred commoners to noblemen, causing discontent among his former partisans. His execution of many opponents {{brought him into}} conflict with Bishop Gerard of Csanád. In 1044, Peter the Venetian <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> assistance of the German monarch, Henry III, who defeated Samuel's larger army {{at the battle of}} Ménfő near Győr. Samuel fled from the battlefield but was captured and killed.|$|E
5|$|The first campaign, in 492 BC, {{was led by}} Darius's {{son-in-law}} Mardonius, who re-subjugated Thrace, {{which had}} nominally {{been part of the}} Persian empire since 513 BC. Mardonius was also able to force Macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom of Persia; it had previously been a vassal, but retained a broad degree of autonomy. However, further progress in this campaign was prevented when Mardonius's fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Mount Athos. Mardonius himself was then injured in a raid on his camp by a Thracian tribe, and after this he <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the expedition to Asia.|$|E

5|$|Tim Downs scouted {{possible}} {{areas for}} location filming. He {{looked for a}} location that could stand in for three different venues without the production having to move or change hotels: the film's opening scene; the God planet's establishing shots; and the Nimbus III Paradise City. Downs {{was familiar with the}} Mojave desert and thought that locations near Ridgecrest, California, would serve the production's needs, so he took photos based on sketches Rodis had provided of what the locations might look like. Downs also shot photos with filters and tried to accomplish dust effects with his car to replicate ideas for how some sequences would be shot. When Downs <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> photos, Shatner felt that the locations the scout found would be perfect for the film.|$|E
5|$|After Béla's {{withdrawal}} from Halych, Roman Mstislavich <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> assistance of Rurik Rostislavich, Prince of Belgorod Kievsky. They tried to expel Andrew and his Hungarian retinue, but the Hungarians routed the united forces of Mstislavich and Rostislavich. A group of local boyars offered the throne to Rostislav Ivanovich, a distant {{cousin of the}} imprisoned Vladimir Yaroslavich. Béla III sent reinforcements to Halych, enabling Andrew's troops to repel the attacks. Andrew's reign remained unpopular in Halych, because the Hungarian soldiers insulted local women and did not respect Orthodox churches. Consequently, the local boyars allied with their former prince, Vladimir Yaroslavich, who had escaped from captivity and returned to Halych. Duke Casimir II of Poland also supported Vladimir Yaroslavich, and they expelled Andrew and his retinue from the principality in August 1189 or 1190. Andrew returned to Hungary after his defeat. He did not receive a separate duchy from his father, who only gave him estates and money. On his deathbed, Béla III, who had pledged to lead a crusade to the Holy Land, ordered Andrew to fulfill his vow. Andrew's father died on 23 April 1196, and Andrew's older brother, Emeric, succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the coral}} reef, {{conventional}} landing craft {{could not be}} used for the landing at Papitalai Mission. The five LVTs, one a combat type and the other four cargo-carrying, set out from Hyane Harbour to Salami Plantation but the road was so bad that only the combat and one cargo LVT were available in time. The attack went ahead anyway, preceded by an airstrike and artillery bombardment by the 271st Field Artillery Battalion. The combat LVT fired 24M8 4.5-inch rockets. Return fire was received from Japanese mortars and machine guns, and a 75mm howitzer. The first wave had to hold alone in the face of fire from Japanese bunkers for 45minutes until the LVTs <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> next wave. Later, they fought off a counterattack by about 30Japanese. Joined by a third LVT which had eventually managed to make it to Salami, the LVTs made 16trips across the harbour before nightfall curtailed operations, transporting part of the 2ndSquadron, 12thCavalry, along with rations, water and ammunition, and evacuating the dead and wounded.|$|E
