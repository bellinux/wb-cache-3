If such a shift occurred, the nonlinearity in the data shows up as a failure to reject the null hypothesis that a unit root is present; that is, the series is I(1). In this <b>reply,</b> <b>evidence</b> is presented-the Phillips-Perron test and a univariate version of the Stock-Watson q-test-suggesting that the net discount ratio is stationary. Hence, the mean is constant. In addition, if one extends the analysis to include the 1989 through 1993 period, the net discount ratio appears to be reverting...|$|E
40|$|In their {{review on}} the retrosplenial cortex Harker and Whishaw [Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 2004] {{claim that there}} is {{continued}} disagreement over {{the importance of this}} region for navigation. They argue that discrepancies in the published effects of retrosplenial lesions reflect two principal variables, choice of rat strain and choice of spatial task. In this <b>reply,</b> <b>evidence</b> is provided showing that Harker and Whishaw [Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 2004] have created a misleading impression and, in fact, there is a clear consensus that the rat retrosplenial cortex is necessary for navigation. Likewise, there is no dispute that the effects of retrosplenial lesions will differ for different tests of spatial learning. While Harker and Whishaw [Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 2004] also conclude that choice of rat strain has a critical impact on whether a lesion-induced deficit is found, a comprehensive review of the published data shows no systematic strain difference. There is, however, growing evidence that when interpreting the effects of retrosplenial lesions, account should be given of the lesion method and its interaction with lesion size...|$|E

40|$|In an {{eye-tracking}} experiment {{we examined}} how readers comprehend indirect replies {{when they are}} uttered in reply to a direct question. Participants read vignettes that described two characters engaged in dialogue. Each dialogue contained a direct question (e. g., How {{are you doing in}} Chemistry?) answered with an excuse (e. g., The exams are not fair). In response to direct questions, such indirect replies are typically used to avoid a face-threatening disclosure (e. g., doing badly on the Chemistry course). Our goal was to determine whether readers are sensitive during reading to the indirect meaning communicated by such replies. Of the three contexts we examined, the first described a negative, face-threatening situation, the second a positive, non-face threatening situation, while the third was neutral. Analysis of reading times to the <b>replies</b> provides strong <b>evidence</b> that readers are sensitive online to the face-saving function of indirect replies...|$|R

If the bearer showed a false and forged treaty, the Congregation must have denounced it, and {{produced}} the genuine document with the signatures. Far from that, in a <b>reply</b> (from internal <b>evidence</b> written by Knox), they admit, [...] "neither do we here {149c} allege {{the breaking of the}} Appointment made at Leith (which, nevertheless, has manifestly been done), but"--and here the writer wanders into quite other questions. Moreover, Knox gives another reply to the Regent, [...] "by some men," [...] in which they write [...] "we dispute not so much whether the bringing in of more Frenchmen be violating of the Appointment, which the Queen and her faction cannot deny to be manifestly broken by them in more cases than one," [...] in no way connected with the French. One of these cases will presently be stated--it is comic enough to deserve record--but, beyond denial, the brethren could not, and did not even attempt to make out their charge as to the Regent's breach of truce by bringing in new, or retaining old, French forces.|$|R
6000|$|He {{does not}} expect, however, to {{convince}} the multitude. Till {{the end of the}} world, 'accounts of miracles and prodigies, I suppose, will be found in all histories, sacred and profane.' Without saying here what he means by a miracle, Hume argues that 'experience is our only guide in reasoning.' He then defines a miracle as 'a violation of the laws of nature.' By a 'law of nature' he means a uniformity, not of all experience, but of each experience as he will deign to admit; while he excludes, without examination, all evidence for experience of the absence of such uniformity. That kind of experience cannot be considered. 'There must be a uniform experience against every miraculous event, otherwise the event would not merit that appellation.' If there be any experience in favour of the event, that experience does not count. A miracle is counter to universal experience, no event is counter to universal experience, therefore no event is a miracle. If you produce evidence to what Hume calls a miracle (we shall see examples) he <b>replies</b> that the <b>evidence</b> is not valid, unless its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact. Now no error of human evidence can be more miraculous than a 'miracle.' Therefore there can be no valid evidence for 'miracles.' Fortunately, Hume now gives an example of what he means by 'miracles.' He says:-- ...|$|R

Josephus prides himself on his accuracy; people whose fathers might have heard Herod's oration were his Contemporaries; and yet his historical sense is so curiously undeveloped that he can, quite innocently, perpetrate an obvious literary fabrication; for one of the two accounts must be incorrect.

40|$|My {{critical}} observation “Down-to-earth is imperative” {{concerning the}} “Landschaftsökologische Raumgliederung Deutschlands” (landscape-ecological regionalisation of Germany; Schröder et al. 2006), published in this journal in 2009 (Weller 2009), received a reply by Winfried Schröder (Schröder 2011, 2012) {{in which he}} underlines the scientificity of the method applied in his regionalisation approach and stresses its superiority compared to a more observational empiricism. The reply closes with the remarks that the critic “has not understood the statistical method which underlies the landscape-ecological regionalisation” and that his “alternative approach does not satisfy fundamental criteria of scientific work”. I have not postulated an “alternative approach” at all; I have simply contrasted Schröder’s regionalisation {{with a number of}} facts which everybody who has ever dealt with landscapes in situ can observe. Numerous examples are able to show that the regionalisation published by Schröder has in fact {{very little to do with}} the actual conditions in the field. Unfortunately, Schröder’s reply does not consider this evidence, not with a single sentence. The missing plausibility test does not seem to be a problem for the authors of this regionalisation. This is not a unique case, but an especially striking example for the kind of uncritical data analysis frequently applied in science disciplines today where the real objects get out of sight. The findings resulting from such an approach are very much in danger of being totally inadequate as a basis for practical applications – which is, after all, explicitly sought by their authors. It was my objective to point out this danger. If there had been any need for another proof of the topicality of the observation of “down-to-earth is imperative”, the distance to reality of this <b>reply</b> is ample <b>evidence</b> for this...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{original}} Friday the 13th, Alice came from California {{and was an}} aspiring artist. She {{got a job as}} a camp counselor at Crystal Lake, New Jersey. She left California to give herself a fresh start after she ended an affair with an older married man. There she began a relationship with middle-aged camp owner Steve Christy that ended badly, and she instead became interested in fellow counselor Bill. One by one, the counselors are stalked and killed, and Alice and Bill become concerned when they can't find the other counselors. After realizing that they are the only two left, they leave the main cabin to investigate, only to discover a bloody axe in Brenda's bed, the phones disconnected, and the cars unusable. When the power goes out, Bill is killed when he goes to find the generator. Alice then heads outside and calls out for him and finds his dead body pinned {{to the back of the}} door. Frightened, she heads back to the main cabin to hide. She sees a vehicle pull up; thinking it's Steve, she rushes out but instead sees a middle-aged woman named Pamela Voorhees, who reveals herself to be the mother of the drowned boy Jason Voorhees, blaming his death on the counselors not watching her son. She also reveals herself as the killer when she violently rushes toward Alice with her knife. A chase ensues with Mrs. Voorhees attempting to kill Alice, but she escapes to the shore of the lake. During the final struggle, Alice decapitates her with a machete. Afterwards, a shaken Alice boards a canoe and falls asleep. Just as she sees police arriving, a decomposing body of a young boy drags her underwater. She then awakens in a hospital, screaming. A police officer tells her the aftermath. When she asks about Jason, the officer <b>replies</b> with no <b>evidence</b> of any boy; Alice says: [...] "He's still there".|$|R
