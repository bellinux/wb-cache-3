40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the impact of the}} computational skills of teachers of Agricultural Science on student’s learning outcomes in secondary schools in Nigeria. The descriptive research design of the survey type, ex-post-factor were adopted in the study. The sample used consisted of 60 teachers and 300 students of Agricultural Science who were randomly selected from the 320 secondary schools in Ekiti State, using purposive sampling technique. Two sets of questionnaires and a structured questionnaire were used for data collection. The data collected were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages, mean, standard deviation, t-test and ANOVA. Hypotheses were tested at 0. 05 level of significance. The study revealed that the teachers often avoid teaching computational contents of the curriculum. The students were found to be faced with poor Mathematical problem solving skills in Agricultural Science. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that school supervisors should monitor the teachers output and ensure that all areas of the curriculum, including contents requiring computations, are adequately covered. Teachers of Agricultural Science should groom their students very well in calculations and mathematical problem solving areas of the curriculum right from the Junior Secondary School, year one. The students poor learning outcomes in mathematical problem solving exercises call <b>for</b> <b>retraining</b> programs <b>for</b> the <b>teachers</b> and motivationa...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The study {{evaluated}} {{the implementation of}} NTI / NCE mathematics curriculum by distance learning system. The study was guided by three research questions and corresponding hypotheses. The population {{was made up of}} 322 NTI mathematics students and 15 course tutors while the sample was made up of 158 students and 7 courses in four NTI study Centers in Bayelsa state Nigeria. The instrument used for the study was NTI Mathematics Curriculum Evaluation Questionnaire (NMCEQ). The instrument was validated by experts and a coefficient reliability of 0. 82 established using Crombach’s alpha method. Pearson product Moment Correlation Coefficient was used in analyzing the data. Findings revealed a significant relationship between structural facilities, teacher’s qualification and evaluation on the implementation of the NTI/NCE mathematics curriculum by distance learning system. The paper therefore suggested among others the provision of adequate facilities and the training and <b>retraining</b> of <b>teachers</b> <b>for</b> the effective implementation of the curriculum...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{realization}} that standards were falling and interest of science among learners in many countries was waning, {{a good number of}} research studies and policy reviews have been commissioned internationally, regionally and even locally to avert the situation. The government of Kenya attaches a lot of importance to education as exemplified by a good proportion of the allotment of the Government‟s expenditure on learning and teaching resources and in particular to Science education. This paper examines instructional intervention strategies which affect the teaching and learning processes based on a study of science education in Baringo Central District in Kenya. It is also concerned with establishing whether teachers‟ intervention in learning can boost science performance given the adequate instructional resources. An empirical study design was adopted for this investigation. The research instrument used was the questionnaire which was categorized into two: one for the students and another <b>for</b> the <b>teachers.</b> Respondents were divided into homogenous subgroups and stratified random sampling was used to identify three schools where three science teachers and a total of 36 students, 12 from each school were involved. The findings were analyzed using a descriptive approach for quantitative data while interpretative approach was employed for the qualitative data respectively. It was established that efforts have been made to improve the state of science education in schools through the purchase of more science equipment, employment of more science teachers, purchase of more textbooks and organizing <b>for</b> <b>retraining</b> of <b>teachers.</b> There is need to organize for regular In-Service Education Trainings (INSETs) <b>for</b> <b>teachers</b> and curriculum implementers in order to enable participants to put in the necessary effort and time to ensure attainment. It is expected that, through the findings of the study and the discussions in this paper, the participants will be conversant with and be diligent practitioners of the Plan, Do, See, Improve (PDSI) and Activities, Students, Experiments and Improvisation (ASEI) ideals for quality teaching and learning...|$|R
40|$|Earth science, as a discipline, is {{ideally suited}} to play a key {{interdisciplinary}} role {{in the study of}} environmental problems. It can provide an interesting, meaningful, relevant, and continuous type of curriculum in which each student may become actively involved. However the course in secondary school earth science which has enjoyed a resurgence of popularity in the past decade seems to be backsliding toward general science once again. Part of the problem may be a shortage of properly trained teachers. But, this problem is a peculiar one. Recent graduates, well trained in earth science, find it difficult to obtain jobs because the school staffs are filled with tenured <b>teachers</b> trained <b>for</b> general science or the biological sciences who are now teaching earth science. It also seems to be difficult to set up programs <b>for</b> <b>retraining</b> these <b>teachers.</b> There is presently, very little motivating force in the way of organizations, state or national, to get earth science moving ahead once again. The systems of school financing, the Montana mill levy in particular, seem to be obsolescent forms because there is an insufficient funding for the school districts each year. Other problems are: the extremely small size of many Montana school districts; accreditation requirements that may not be entirely adequate; secondary and college level teacher preparatory requirements that may be unrealistic...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{effective}} implementation of C 2005 by the Grade 7 teachers in the Motherwell area. <b>For</b> <b>teachers</b> {{to meet the demands}} of the new curriculum, in-service training is needed to develop them to be competent in all the aspects required for the use of the OBE approach. The main research question is: How have Grade 7 teachers in Motherwell implemented C 2005 in their classrooms? Questionnaires and interviews were used as tools to collect the data. The data was collected from five selected primary schools in the Motherwell area. The teachers’ responses obtained from questionnaires and interviews were analyzed both statistically (using tables) and descriptively (telling teachers’ stories). Responses determined the competence of teachers in four areas, namely, teaching methods, content, classroom organization and assessment of learners. An account of inservice training courses attended by teachers is provided. These courses revealed the problems encountered by teachers during the implementation process and the subsequent assisstance they received. The data provided in this study is in line with the research done by the Review Committee (Chisholm, 2000) in the Eastern Cape. Recommendations of the Review Committee gave rise to the establishment of the Revised National Curriculum Statement (RNCS). The responses from this study confirmed the need <b>for</b> <b>retraining</b> of <b>teachers</b> to develop their competences. This study urges the Department of Education to focus on establishing methods of training that will develop teachers in their teaching experience. The SMTs should also be able to assist teachers with the problems they encounter in their schools. Teachers should be able to take responsibility for their learners’ competence and take ownership of changes in their schools.
