Additionally, the spectrum produced in the thermal bremsstrahlung process is flat up to a cutoff frequency, νcut, and falls off exponentially at higher frequencies. This sequence of events forms the typical spectrum of [...] phenomenon when the atmosphere is clear, with no fog.

The {{goal of this}} work is to model surface catalysis in partially dissociated Air-SiO 2 systems, which is of interest for accurately predicting heating on hypersonic vehicles. This is accomplished through molecular dynamics simulations using the ReaxFF potential, which is able to accurately model chemical reactions. The performance of the ReaxFF potential for predicting the bulk structures of several different types of SiO 2 is evaluated, and we find that it most accurately reproduces the structure of fi-quartz. Potential energy surfaces for several reactions of interest in catalysis show that the potential may need further training to reproduce results from Quantum Chemical Calculations. Based on a literature review of experimental results and {{the capabilities of the}} potential, we choose to model oxygen catalysis on Fi-Quartz. A methodology for measuring <b>recombination</b> <b>coefficients</b> on a silica surface is developed, and tested for gases at 10 atm and 100 atm over the temperature range(600 - 2000 K).

We have {{taken into account}} the density dependence of the coefficients arising from the relative populations of the fine-structure levels of the ground state of the recombining ion, an elaboration {{that has not been}} attempted before for this ion, and it opens up the possibility of electron density determination via recombination line analysis. Photoionization cross-sections, bound state energies, and the oscillator strengths of Nii with n ≤ 11 and l ≤ 4 have been obtained using the close-coupling R-matrix method in the intermediate coupling scheme. Photoionization data were computed that accurately map out the near-threshold resonances and were used to derive <b>recombination</b> <b>coefficients,</b> including radiative and dielectronic recombination. Also new is including the effects of dielectronic recombination via high-n resonances lying between the ^ 2 P^ o _ 1 / 2 and ^ 2 P^ o _ 3 / 2 levels. The new calculations are valid for temperatures down to an unprecedentedly low level (approximately 100 K). The newly calculated effective <b>recombination</b> <b>coefficients</b> allow us to construct plasma diagnostics based on the measured strengths of the Nii optical recombination lines (ORLs).

We produced ions in the chamber using a 3. 5 GeV $c^{− 1 }$ beam of positively charged pions $(π^+) $ generated by the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS).

The range of the ion production rate varied from 2 to 100 $cm^{− 3 } s^{− 1 }$, covering the typical range of ionization throughout the troposphere. The temperature ranged from − 55 to 20 °C, the relative humidity (RH) from 0 to 70 %, the SO 2 concentration from 0 to 40 ppb, and the ozone concentration from 200 to 700 ppb. The best agreement of the retrieved ion–ion <b>recombination</b> <b>coefficient</b> with the commonly used literature value of 1. 6 × $ 10 ^{− 6 } cm^ 3 s^{− 1 }$ was found at a temperature of 5 °C and a RH of 40 % (1. 5 ± 0. 6) × $ 10 ^{− 6 } cm^ 3 s^{− 1 }$.

Under dc voltage bias and high photo-excitation intensities, there appear self-sustained oscillations of the current due to a repeated homogeneous nucleation {{of a number of}} charge dipole waves inside the superlattice. In contrast to the case of a constant <b>recombination</b> <b>coefficient,</b> nucleated dipole waves can split for a field-dependent <b>recombination</b> <b>coefficient</b> in two oppositely moving dipoles. The key for understanding these unusual properties is that these superlattices have a unique static electric-field domain.
