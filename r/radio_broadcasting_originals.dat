The station was once housed in the historic Jasper Yeates House. [...] It was owned by the Steinman family, which also owned two local newspapers, the Intelligencer Journal and the Lancaster New Era. In 1944 a sister FM station {{went on the}} air (still co-owned with WLPA with the WROZ callsign) and in 1949, the family added Pennsylvania's first television station outside Philadelphia. The TV station is now owned by The Hearst Corporation and still has the WGAL call sign. For most of its history, WLPA was a full service radio station, airing Middle of the road music, news, talk and sports. It was a long-time affiliate of the NBC Radio Network.|$|R
5000|$|WMPH {{was known}} as [...] "The Non-Commercial Rock Station" [...] during its heyday in the 1970s with a Top 40 and Progressive Rock format. The station was entirely {{operated}} by Mount Pleasant High School students many of whom went on to careers in the <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> industry. <b>Original</b> studios were {{in the basement of}} the high school. The station kept broadcasting hours before the school day with announcers such as [...] "The Dutchman" [...] Guy VanderLek and [...] "Big Al" [...] Ingalls. After the school day the station would sign back on at 3 PM with more student announcers including Joy VanderLek (who went on to be an air talent at Connecticut Radio Network), Bruce Weiner, Stephen D. Streiker, David Mackenzie, Steve Balick, Leigh Jacobs, and Mike Schwartz (to name a very few). Well known Broadway actor John Dossett was an announcer (1972-1976) while he attended Mount Pleasant.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{the first comprehensive}} narrative account {{of the history of}} classical music radio in the UK between 1945 and 1995, from before the launch of the Third Programme until after the launch of Classic FM. It describes and analyses the rich range of output across all relevant radio stations in this period, rebutting the conventional assumption that this aspect of British radio was simply about the Third Programme and Radio 3. At almost all times {{during the second half of}} the 20 th Century, those stations were not the majority providers of classical music radio. Classical music radio over these years was marked by a series of high points, when the provision of elite and popular output combined to open the genre to a wide range of listeners; and then by a series of retreats from those summits. During three spells – the late Forties, the late Sixties and the early Nineties – a multi-channel offering of both highbrow and middlebrow music, linked and presented in an accessible way, achieved broad appeal and wide audiences, and realised the potential for this public good. The classical music programming of Independent Local Radio between 1973 and 1990 did the same in individual localities, to a previously unappreciated extent. This new narrative history of classical music radio in the UK highlights and is dominated by the dialectic between highbrow and popular culture, between elite and demotic taste, and between a class-based and a classless approach to <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting.</b> <b>Original</b> audience data demonstrate a consistent potential audience for classical music radio of some five to six million throughout these years, provided listeners felt they were allowed to listen in. Original content analysis demonstrates a canonic repertoire of classical music radio, arrived at and maintained on a reflexive basis between the producers and the consumers of this genre, centred on the works of 19 th Century European composers. That canon has remained largely unchallenged except at the popular margins, in contrast to modern approaches to the literary canon, and distinguishes classical music from other art forms. This account illustrates a particular aspect of listening, whereby classical music radio can validly be both foreground and background. The influence of individuals, and therefore the relevance of biography within this history, is shown to be significant, but overall less important than the social, political, cultural and economic context in which the radio services operated, and which shaped their output. Classical music radio is an archetypal element of public service <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting.</b> This narrative shows that it has been provided during this period by stations outside the main cultural cohort, even from 1973 outside the BBC. As such, it challenges institutional definitions of public service broadcasting, and demonstrates how relationships between the producers of radio and its consumers can operate at many levels, testifying to the multi-threaded tapestry of UK cultural life as a whole in the second half of the 20 th century...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} a policy {{investigation}} of community <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> in Zambia. The emergence of this tier of broadcasting {{can be traced to}} the 1990 s, following the country's policy of politico-economic liberalisation. The state broadcasting system had hitherto reigned supreme. Based upon a focused synthesis of a range of historical, political, policy, regulatory and other factors, within the context of participatory development communication, this study proposes a normative policy model for community <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> in Zambia. To begin with, the study focuses on the historical factors that have influenced the development of community <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> in the country, particularly in the period before and after 1991. This historical analysis establishes the fact that the shape that community <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> has assumed in Zambia is largely reflective of the state-centric policy-making regime. This policy-making regime is itself a legacy of British colonialism. Next, the study offers a conceptual framework of community <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting.</b> It analyses several theoretical antecedents upon which the conceptual edifice of community <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> would seem to be built. In particular, the study explores the contributions of media effects and normative media theories towards the conceptual underpinnings of community <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting.</b> Furthermore, as an attempt at establishing some empirical referents for developing a community <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> policy for Zambia, the study delves into a comparative analysis of trends in broadcast policy and regulatory practices throughout the world, with a special focus on Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa and Australia. This comparative policy analysis reveals differentiated levels of sophistication of policy-cum-regulatory models relating to community <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting.</b> This provides a wealth of chequered experiences for Zambia to learn from. To further substantiate the case for a policy model, the study examines selected community radio initiatives in Zambia. Finally, based upon this focused synthesis, the study proposes a normative policy model for community <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> in Zambia. The policy proposal, informed by the assumptions of the group and organised anarchy models of policy-making, seeks to promote community <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> in terms of its vision, regulatory structures, funding, training, facilities, technology, production of local content and research.
