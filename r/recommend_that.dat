5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> people reduce their dietary intake of salt.

In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E

Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when reporting a test-taker's IQ.
