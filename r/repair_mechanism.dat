25|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair is a DNA <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism.</b> There are three {{excision repair}} pathways: nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), and DNA mismatch repair (MMR). In NER, the damaged DNA strand is removed and the undamaged strand is kept as {{a template for}} the formation of a complementary sequence with DNA polymerase. DNA ligase joins the strands together to form dsDNA. There are two subpathways for NER, which differ only in their mechanism for recognition: global genomic NER (GG-NER) and transcription coupled NER (TC-NER).|$|E
25|$|A scar is {{the product}} of the body's <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism</b> after tissue injury. If a wound heals quickly within two weeks with new {{formation}} of skin, minimal collagen will be deposited and no scar will form. Generally, if a wound takes longer than three to four weeks to become covered, a scar will form. Small full thickness wounds under 2mm reepithilize fast and heal scar free. Deep second-degree burns heal with scarring and hair loss. Sweat glands do not form in scar tissue, which impairs the regulation of body temperature. Elastic fibers are generally not detected in scar tissue younger than 3 months old. In scars rete pegs are lost; through a lack of rete pegs scars tend to shear easier than normal tissue.|$|E

25|$|The first {{measurements}} of photoinhibition {{were published in}} 1956 by Bessel Kok. Even {{in the very first}} studies, it was obvious that plants have a <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism</b> that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage. In 1966, Jones and Kok measured the action spectrum of photoinhibition and found that ultraviolet light is highly photoinhibitory. The visible-light part of the action spectrum was found to have a peak in the red-light region, suggesting that chlorophylls act as photoreceptors of photoinhibition. In the 1980s, photoinhibition became a popular topic in photosynthesis research, and the concept of a damaging reaction counteracted by a repair process was re-invented. Research was stimulated by a paper by Kyle, Ohad and Arntzen in 1984, showing that photoinhibition is accompanied by selective loss of a 32-kDa protein, later identified as the PSII reaction center protein D1. The photosensitivity of PSII from which the oxygen evolving complex had been inactivated with chemical treatment was studied in the 1980s and early 1990s. A paper by Imre Vass and coworkers in 1992 described the acceptor-side mechanism of photoinhibition. species promote chlorophyll triplet formation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|volume=89| year=1992|pages=14081412 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.4.1408|issue = 4}} Measurements of production of singlet oxygen by photoinhibited PSII provided further evidence for an acceptor-side-type mechanism. The concept of a repair cycle that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage, evolved and was reviewed by Aro et al. in 1993. Many details of the repair cycle, including the finding that the FtsH protease {{plays an important role in}} the degradation of the D1 protein, have been discovered since. In 1996, a paper by Tyystjärvi and Aro showed that the rate constant of photoinhibition is directly proportional to light intensity, a result that opposed the former assumption that photoinhibition is caused by the fraction of light energy that exceeds the maximum capability of photosynthesis. The following year, laser pulse photoinhibition experiments done by Itzhak Ohad's group led to the suggestion that charge recombination reactions may be damaging because they can lead to production of singlet oxygen. The molecular mechanism(s) of photoinhibition are constantly under discussion. The newest candidate is the manganese mechanism suggested 2005 by the group of Esa Tyystjärvi. A similar mechanism was suggested by the group of Norio Murata, also in 2005.|$|E
500|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair (NER) repairs damaged DNA which commonly consists of bulky, helix-distorting damage, such as pyrimidine dimerization caused by UV light. Damaged regions are removed in 12–24 nucleotide-long strands in a three-step process {{which consists of}} recognition of damage, excision of damaged DNA both upstream and downstream of damage by endonucleases, and resynthesis of removed DNA region. NER is a highly evolutionarily conserved <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism</b> and is used in nearly all eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. In prokaryotes, NER is mediated by Uvr proteins. In eukaryotes, many more proteins are involved, although the general strategy is the same.|$|E
500|$|An intein is a [...] "parasitic" [...] {{segment of}} a protein that {{is able to}} excise itself from the chain of amino acids as they emerge from the {{ribosome}} and rejoin the remaining portions with a peptide bond {{in such a manner}} that the main protein [...] "backbone" [...] does not fall apart. This is a case of a protein changing its own primary sequence from the sequence originally encoded by the DNA of a gene. Additionally, most inteins contain a homing endonuclease or HEG domain which is capable of finding a copy of the parent gene that does not include the intein nucleotide sequence. On contact with the intein-free copy, the HEG domain initiates the DNA double-stranded break <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This process causes the intein sequence to be copied from the original source gene to the intein-free gene. This is an example of protein directly editing DNA sequence, as well as increasing the sequence's heritable propagation.|$|E

500|$|Double-strand breaks can be {{repaired}} through homologous recombination or through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). [...] NHEJ is a DNA <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism</b> which, unlike homologous recombination, {{does not require}} a long homologous sequence to guide repair. [...] Whether homologous recombination or NHEJ is used to repair double-strand breaks is largely determined by the phase of cell cycle. [...] Homologous recombination repairs DNA before the cell enters mitosis (M phase). [...] It occurs during and shortly after DNA replication, in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, when sister chromatids are more easily available. Compared to homologous chromosomes, which are similar to another chromosome but often have different alleles, sister chromatids are an ideal template for homologous recombination because they are an identical copy of a given chromosome. [...] In contrast to homologous recombination, NHEJ is predominant in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, when the cell is growing but not yet ready to divide. [...] It occurs less frequently after the G1 phase, but maintains at least some activity throughout the cell cycle. [...] The mechanisms that regulate homologous recombination and NHEJ throughout the cell cycle vary widely between species.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} types of DNA damage, but DSBs, in particular, are the most harmful as both strands are {{completely}} disjointed {{from the rest of}} the chromosome. [...] If an efficient <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism</b> does not exist, the ends of the DNA can eventually degrade, leading to a permanent loss of sequence. [...] A double-stranded gap in DNA will also prevent replication from proceeding, resulting in an incomplete copy of that specific chromosome, targeting the cell for apoptosis. [...] As with all DNA damage, DSBs can introduce new mutations that can ultimately lead to cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) {{directly}} ligates DNA {{from either}} side of a double-strand break where there is very little or no sequence overlap for annealing. This <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism</b> induces errors in the genome via indels (insertion or deletion), or chromosomal rearrangement; any such errors may render the gene products coded at that location non-functional. [...] Because this activity can vary depending on the species, cell type, target gene, and nuclease used, it should be monitored when designing new systems. [...] A simple heteroduplex cleavage assay can be run which detects any difference between two alleles amplified by PCR. Cleavage products can be visualized on simple agarose gels or slab gel systems.|$|E

2500|$|Hydroxyl {{radicals}} can {{attack the}} deoxyribose DNA backbone and bases, potentially causing {{a plethora of}} lesions that can be cytotoxic or mutagenic. Cells have developed complex and efficient repair mechanisms to fix the lesions. In the case of free radical attack on DNA, base-excision repair is the <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism</b> used. [...] Hydroxyl radical reactions with the deoxyribose sugar backbone are initiated by hydrogen abstraction from a deoxyribose carbon, and the predominant consequence is eventual strand breakage and base release. [...] The hydroxyl radical reacts with the various hydrogen atoms of the deoxyribose in the order 5′ H > 4′ H > 3′ H ≈ 2′ H ≈ 1′ H. This order of reactivity parallels the exposure to solvent of the deoxyribose hydrogens.|$|E

40|$|In mammals, {{there is}} a complex and {{intriguing}} relationship between DNA repair and gametogenesis. DNA <b>repair</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are involved {{not only in the}} repair of different types of DNA damage in developing germline cells, but also take part in the meiotic recombination process.

In the present review, several gametogenic aspects of DNA mismatch repair, homologous recombination repair and postreplication repair are discussed. In addition, the role of DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint control is considered briefly. It appears that many genes encoding proteins that take part in DNA <b>repair</b> <b>mechanisms</b> show enhanced or specialized expression during mammalian gametogenesis, and several gene knockout mouse models show male or female infertility.

5000|$|An {{argument}} against {{this hypothesis is}} that adequate repair mechanisms including those involving recombination already exist in prokaryotes. Prokaryotes do have DNA <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism</b> enriched with recombinational repair, {{and the existence of}} prokaryotic life in severe environment indicates the extreme efficiency of this mechanism to help them survive many DNA damages related to the environment. This implies that an extra costly repair in the form of meiosis would be unnecessary. However, most of these mechanisms cannot be as accurate as and is possibly more mutagenic than the <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism</b> provided by meiosis. They primarily do not require a second homologous chromosome for the recombination that promotes a more extensive repair. Thus, despite the efficiency of recombinational repair involving sister chromatids, the repair still needs to be improved, and another type of repair is required. Moreover, due to the more extensive homologous recombinational repair in meiosis in comparison to the repair in mitosis, meiosis as a <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism</b> can accurately remove any damage that arises at any stage of the cell cycle more than mitotic <b>repair</b> <b>mechanism</b> can do [...] and was, therefore, naturally selected. In contrast, the sister chromatid in mitotic recombination could have been exposed to similar amount of stress, and, thus, this type of recombination, instead of eliminating the damage, could actually spread the damage and decrease fitness.|$|E
