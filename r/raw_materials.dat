40|$|Efficient product costing and {{inventory}} valuation are much emphasized in today’s manufacturing environment {{because of their}} importance in management decisions. However, especially volatile <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> prices bring challenges to reliability of product costing {{and inventory}} valuation. This relatively little regarded, but important viewpoint is investigated in this research. The research problem is stated as follows: how should <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> flow around <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> inventory be valuated? In literature review eight factors {{that should be considered}} when choosing inventory valuation and product costing methods were determined. Based on these factors three variables that affect the efficiency of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> inventory valuation and product costing were defined, and they were tax shield benefits, product costing accurateness and how well information reflects the performance of a company. For the empirical part a framework was formed based on these three variables. In the empirical part a simulation model was built and based on the model <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> inventory valuation methods were evaluated. A scenario analysis was done in order to analyze generality and robustness of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> inventory valuation methods. Using the simulation model and the scenario analysis different <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> inventory valuation methods are evaluated in a real company environment, and results that cannot be derived analytically are disclosed. By using a correct <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> inventory valuation method business can be much improved. In the case company on which the simulation model is based, product costing error can be decreased by 14 % of product costs and inventory value fluctuation by 7 % of inventory value by just choosing adequate inventory valuation method. The main determinant of the magnitude in improvements is <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> price behavior. In the case of high inflation the benefits of using correct inventory valuation method can be very great. Also volatility of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> prices affects results significantly. The main contribution of this research is the investigation of the effects of uncertain <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> prices in the context of product costing and inventory valuation. The main result that contradicts current research is that FIFO (first-in first-out) should not be used for <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> accounting.
