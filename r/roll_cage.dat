5|$|The {{production}} model utilised the same Alcan bonded honeycomb aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT) as the concept {{car for the}} chassis. The chassis design featured two box section rails which acted as the suspension mounting points and would provide an energy absorbing structure {{in the event of}} a frontal impact, these were successfully tested at speeds up to , an integral <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> formed part of the chassis and monocoque, providing additional structural rigidity for the car and allowing the XJ220 to easily pass stringent crash testing.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies are}} {{built around a}} control chassis, {{featuring}} a full <b>roll</b> <b>cage,</b> originally designed by PACE Innovations but which can be made, or partially made, by other accredited builders, including certain race teams. Many safety features are utilised to protect the driver {{in the event of}} a crash. The fuel tank is positioned in front of the rear axle to prevent it from being damaged or ruptured in a rear end impact. The driver is seated towards the centre of the car and extra reinforcement is used on the <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> on the driver's side to lessen the risk of injury in a side-on collision. The cars also feature a collapsible steering column and a fire extinguisher system.|$|E

He had won only one feature at Knoxville a couple of months prior and was beginning to peak as a driver. Unfortunately Gritz lost his life two weeks later in a crash at the Nebraska State Fair where IMCA rules at the time did not allow <b>roll</b> <b>cages.</b> His accident sparked the rule change that <b>roll</b> <b>cages</b> were mandated after that.|$|R
25|$|Several Mustang SSPs were {{converted}} by the CHP to EVOC (Emergency Vehicle Operations Course) track vehicles.

Räikkönen could not start in the Rally Catalunya because he crashed during the shakedown, leaving the <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> damaged, and the team {{did not have enough}} time to repair it. Subsequently Räikkönen decided to not take part in the rally at all, even when he could by super rally rules. The reason was stated to be saving the car.|$|E
50|$|The {{decline in}} {{popularity}} of convertibles in the US was partly caused by concern about lack of protection in rollover accidents, because most convertibles have no protection beyond the windshield frame. Some convertibles provide rollover protection using two protruding curved bars behind the headrests. Some Mercedes-Benz convertibles have a retractable roll bar which deploys {{in case of}} an accident. Race cars almost always have <b>roll</b> <b>cages,</b> since racing is very likely to result in a rollover. In addition, the <b>roll</b> <b>cage's</b> chassis-stiffening effect is usually seen as a benefit to the car.|$|R
