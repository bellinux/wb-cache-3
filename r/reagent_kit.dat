5000|$|The ampliPHOX Colorimetric Detection Technology {{was created}} as a {{research}} tool {{for the analysis of}} low-density microarrays by providing rapid, cost effective colorimetric detection with minimal user input. The combination of a simple <b>reagent</b> <b>kit</b> and a small benchtop instrument provide a powerful new detection technology for low density (<2500 spots) microarray applications and is produced by InDevR, Inc. With an investment about ten times lower than that required for a typical microarray scanner, ampliPHOX provides equivalent analytical sensitivity to fluorescence with a simple colorimetric readout.|$|E

40|$|Summary: A {{sensitive}} and specific automatic biolumineseent method is described for glucose determination in senim samples using commercially available reagent-kits. The Boehringer Gluco-quant kit, originally designed for spectrophotometric measurement, was successfully coupled to the bacterial luciferase NAD(P) H-linked System. The method's validity was proven {{by comparison with}} a spectrophotometric method. Correla-tion was excellent (r = 0. 98, n = 50). Precision attained by 30 assays was good (CV 1. 19 %). The assay was verified by determining the glucose concentrations of more than 1000 serum samples. Using a microcomputer-controlled automatic luminescence analyser (Berthold LB 950 T) and <b>reagent</b> <b>kits</b> for luminometry (Boehringer Mannheim, LKB Wallac, Lumac/ 3 M), the complete assay can be performed fully automatically with commercially available <b>reagent</b> <b>kits.</b> More than 200 samples can be assayed by one individual per day. The bioluminescence method is at least 100 times more sensitive than spectrophotometric measurements. Other <b>reagent</b> <b>kits</b> tested (Behring, Merck, Sigma) are also suitable for coupling to the NAD(P) H-linked luciferase System.
