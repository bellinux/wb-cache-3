40|$|During {{the eating}} of food, the in-mouth process leads to food {{breakdown}} which induces {{the release of}} flavour compounds. Volatile and non-volatile compounds are released into the saliva, and volatile compounds are transferred into the vapour phase to reach olfactory receptors in the nasal cavity. The aim of this chapter is to review the effects of changing the composition of cheeses on the mobility, <b>release</b> <b>and</b> perception of flavour molecules (salt, aroma compounds), and to discuss the results with respect to human physiology. Cheese is a good model because {{it is possible to}} vary its composition (in lipids, proteins, salt), in order to comply with nutritional guidelines (less salt, less fat) and to study the effects of these changes in composition on its microstructure and texture, and then on flavour (taste <b>and</b> aroma) <b>release</b> <b>and</b> perception, while taking account of in-mouth breakdown. Papers on this subject have mainly been related to either salt <b>release</b> <b>and</b> perception or aroma <b>release</b> <b>and</b> perception, and few have taken account of the combined effects of cheese composition on both salt <b>and</b> aroma <b>release</b> <b>and</b> perception. Indeed, recent papers from our research group have shown that the salt and fat contents of cheeses induce modifications to texture and microstructure that affect not only salt <b>release</b> <b>and</b> perception but also aroma <b>release</b> <b>and</b> perception and chewing behaviour...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the relationships between sodium <b>release,</b> saltiness, <b>and</b> oral parameters during theeating of lipoprotein matrices (LPM). Sodium <b>release</b> <b>and</b> saltiness relative to 10 LPM were recorded during normal mastication by five subjects with differing oral parameters (chewing efficiency and salivary flow rate). The LPM samples varied in composition (dry matter, fat, salt, and pH levels) and represented {{a broad range of}} hardness. Mastication was recorded using electromyography simultaneously with sensory assessment. Differences in chewing behavior could explain most of the variability in sodium <b>release</b> <b>and</b> saltiness among subjects. Subjects with a higher chewing force and lower salivary flow rate experienced higher levels of sodium <b>release</b> <b>and</b> saltiness. In terms of the LPM, sodium <b>release</b> <b>and</b> saltiness were affected by either chewing behavior or food composition...|$|R

40|$|Gonadotropin (GTH) <b>and</b> GH <b>released</b> {{from the}} {{pituitary}} {{are known to}} interact at multiple levels to modulate {{the functions of the}} gonadotrophic and somatotrophic axes. However, their interactions at the pituitary level have not been fully characterized. In this study, autocrine/paracrine regulation of GH synthesis and secretion by local interactions between gonadotrophs and somatotrophs was examined using grass carp pituitary cells as a cell model. Exogenous GTH and GH induced GH <b>release</b> <b>and</b> GH mRNA expression in carp pituitary cells. Removal of endogenous GTH and GH by immunoneutralization with GTH and GH antisera, respectively, suppressed GH <b>release,</b> GH production, <b>and</b> GH mRNA levels. GH antiserum also blocked the stimulatory effects of exogenous GTH on GH <b>release</b> <b>and</b> GH mRNA levels. In reciprocal experiments, GH <b>release</b> <b>and</b> GH mRNA expression induced by exogenous GH was significantly reduced by GTH antiserum. In addition, exogenous GH was found to be inhibitory to basal GTH <b>release</b> <b>and</b> treatment with GH antiserum elevated GTH secretion at low doses but suppressed GTH production at high doses. These results suggest that local interactions between gonadotrophs and somatotrophs may form an intrapituitary feedback loop to regulate GH <b>release</b> <b>and</b> synthesis. In this model, GTH released from gonadotrophs induces GH <b>release</b> <b>and</b> GH production in neighboring somatotrophs. GH secreted maintains somatotroph sensitivity to GTH stimulation, and at the same time, inhibits basal GTH release in gonadotrophs. This feedback loop may represent a novel mechanism regulating GH <b>release</b> <b>and</b> synthesis in lower vertebrates. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
