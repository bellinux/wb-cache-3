The distance between edge of the diode and edge of the laser cut with which begins increase of <b>reverse</b> <b>currents</b> of the diodes in Si: for supply voltage was 8, 2 V – 5 µ, 20 V- 26 µ; in HgCdTe: for working voltage (0, 1 V) the distance was 18 µ. 2. The laser radiation causes temporary increase of <b>reverse</b> <b>currents</b> of the diodes on distances from 2 µ and more (measurement of a <b>reverse</b> <b>currents</b> of the diodes on distances 36 and 78 µ have shown reduction of a <b>reverse</b> <b>currents,</b> in time about 400 minutes). 3. Our experimental data allow us to develop criteria of definition of parameters of laser radiation for laser cutting of semiconductor materials on distances in some microns from elements of the integrated circuits.

On the other hand, more general axisymmetric equilibria with <b>reversed</b> <b>current</b> density and poloidal ¯eld do exist.

2500|$|At {{very large}} reverse bias, beyond the {{peak inverse voltage}} or PIV, a process called reverse {{breakdown}} occurs that causes a large increase in current (i.e., {{a large number of}} electrons and holes are created at, and move away from the p–n junction) that usually damages the device permanently. The avalanche diode is deliberately designed for use in that manner. In the Zener diode, the concept of PIV is not applicable. A Zener diode contains a heavily doped p–n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material, such that the reverse voltage is [...] "clamped" [...] to a known value (called the Zener voltage), and avalanche does not occur. Both devices, however, do have a limit to the maximum current and power they can withstand in the clamped reverse-voltage region. Also, following the end of forward conduction in any diode, there is <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> for a short time. The device does not attain its full blocking capability until the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> ceases.|$|E

30|$|Equation (5) {{shows that}} the ideality factor is {{inversely}} proportional to the temperature. The ideality factor significantly decreases with temperature only at low temperature and changes slowly when the temperature is over 300 [*]K [28, 29]. However, as shown in Table  1, the <b>reverse</b> saturation <b>current</b> increases significantly with the temperature which {{is different from the}} ideality factor. It can be explained by Eq. (2). According to Eq. (2), the <b>reverse</b> saturation <b>current</b> increases with temperature because T 2 and exp (−[*]qΦB/kT) increase with temperature. Due to the exponential relationship between exp (−[*]qΦB/kT) and −[*]qΦB/kT, exp (−[*]qΦB/kT) increases significantly with temperature. Based on the research by Zhu et al [30], qΦB of the Au/Si contact in the experiment at 273 [*]K and 295 [*]K are 0.77 [*]eV and 0.79 [*]eV, respectively. The calculated results show that the <b>reverse</b> saturation <b>current</b> at 295 [*]K is six times as much as the <b>reverse</b> saturation <b>current</b> at 273 [*]K, explaining why the <b>reverse</b> saturation <b>current</b> increases significantly with temperature.|$|R

M.A. de la Rive has described a peculiar property acquired by metallic conductors, when being immersed in a liquid as poles, they have completed, for some time, the voltaic circuit, in consequence of which, when separated from the battery and plunged into the same fluid, they by themselves produce an electric current[B].

The proof, therefore, {{appears to}} me complete, that the {{combination}} of the acid with the oxide, in the former experiment, {{had nothing to do with}} the production of the electric current; for the same current is here produced when the action of the acid is absent, and the reverse action of an alkali is present. I think it cannot be supposed for a moment, that the alkali acted chemically as an acid to the oxide formed; on the contrary, our general chemical knowledge leads to the conclusion, that the ordinary metallic oxides act rather as acids to the alkalies; yet that kind of action would tend to give a <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> in the present case, if any were due to the union of the oxide of the exciting metal with the body which combines with it. But instead of any variation of this sort, the direction of the electricity was constant, and its quantity also directly proportional to the water decomposed, or the zinc oxidized. There are reasons for believing that acids and alkalies, when in contact with metals upon which they cannot act directly, still have a power of influencing their attractions for oxygen (941.); but all the effects in these experiments prove, I think, that it is the oxidation of the metal necessarily dependent upon, and associated as it is with, the electrolyzation of the water (921. 923.) that produces the current; and that the acid or alkali merely acts as solvents, and by removing the oxidized zinc, allows other portions to decompose fresh water, and so continues the evolution or determination of the current.|$|E

60|$|She {{waited until}} the last man had stepped into the boat, in nervous dread of some one remaining. Then, when the boat had {{vanished}} round the Point again, she {{ran back to the}} cottage, arrayed herself in her husband's pilot coat, hat, and boots, and launched the dingey. It was a heavy, slow, but luckily a stanch and seaworthy boat. It was not until she was well off shore that she began to feel the full fury of the wind and waves, and knew the difficulty and danger of her undertaking. She had decided that her shortest and most direct course was within a few points of the wind, but the quartering of the waves on the broad bluff bows of the boat tended to throw it to leeward, a movement that, while it retarded her forward progress, no doubt saved the little craft from swamping. Again, the feebleness and shortness of her stroke, which never impelled her through a rising wave, but rather lifted her half way up its face, prevented the boat from taking much water, while her steadfast gaze, fixed only on the slowly retreating shore, kept her steering free from any fatal nervous vacillation, which the sight of the threatening seas on her bow might have produced. Preserved through her very weakness, ignorance, and simplicity of purpose, the dingey had all the security of a drifting boat, yet retained a certain gentle but persistent guidance. In this feminine fashion she made enough headway to carry her abreast of the Point, where she met the reflux current sweeping round it that carried her well along into the channel, now sluggish with the turn of the tide. After half an hour's pulling, she was delighted to find herself again in a <b>reverse</b> <b>current,</b> abreast of her cottage, but steadily increasing her distance from it. She was, in fact, on the extreme outer edge of a vast whirlpool formed by the force of the gale on a curving lee shore, and was being carried to her destination in a semicircle around that bay which she never could have crossed. She was moving now in a line with the shore and the Fort, whose flagstaff, above its green, square, and white quarters, she could see distinctly, and whose lower water battery and landing seemed to stretch out from the rocks scarcely a mile ahead. Protected by the shore from the fury of the wind, and even of the sea, her progress was also steadily accelerated by the velocity of the current, mingling with the ebbing tide. A sudden fear seized her. She turned the boat's head towards the shore, but it was swept quickly round again; she redoubled her exertions, tugging frantically at her helpless oars. She only succeeded in getting the boat into the trough of the sea, where, after a lurch that threatened to capsize it, it providentially swung around on its short keel and began to drift stern on. She was almost abreast of the battery now; she could hear the fitful notes of a bugle that seemed blown and scattered above her head; she even thought she could see some men in blue uniforms moving along the little pier. She was passing it; another fruitless effort to regain her ground, but she was swept along steadily towards the Gate, the whitening bar, and the open sea.|$|E
