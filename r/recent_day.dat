60|$|There are {{few books}} which are {{fit to be}} remembered in our wisest hours, but the Iliad is {{brightest}} in the serenest days, and embodies still all the sunlight that fell on Asia Minor. No modern joy or ecstasy of ours can lower its height or dim its lustre, but there it lies in the east of literature, as it were the earliest and latest production of the mind. The ruins of Egypt oppress and stifle us with their dust, foulness preserved in cassia and pitch, and swathed in linen; the death of that which never lived. But the rays of Greek poetry struggle down to us, and mingle with the sunbeams of the <b>recent</b> <b>day.</b> The statue of Memnon is cast down, but the shaft of the Iliad still meets the sun in his rising.|$|E
60|$|They {{had gone}} almost {{immediately}} to Paris, and had spent their {{days at the}} Louvre and their evenings at the theatre. Roderick was divided in mind as to whether Titian or Mademoiselle Delaporte was the greater artist. They had come down through France to Genoa and Milan, had spent a fortnight in Venice and another in Florence, and had now been a month in Rome. Roderick had said that he meant to spend three months in simply looking, absorbing, and reflecting, without putting pencil to paper. He looked indefatigably, and certainly saw great things--things greater, doubtless, at times, than {{the intentions of the}} artist. And yet he made few false steps and wasted little time in theories of what he ought to like and to dislike. He judged instinctively and passionately, but never vulgarly. At Venice, for a couple of days, he had half a fit of melancholy over the pretended discovery that he had missed his way, and that the only proper vestment of plastic conceptions was the coloring of Titian and Paul Veronese. Then one morning the two young men had themselves rowed out to Torcello, and Roderick lay back {{for a couple of hours}} watching a brown-breasted gondolier making superb muscular movements, in high relief, against the sky of the Adriatic, and at the end jerked himself up with a violence that nearly swamped the gondola, and declared that the only thing worth living for was to make a colossal bronze and set it aloft in the light of a public square. In Rome his first care was for the Vatican; he went there again and again. But the old imperial and papal city altogether delighted him; only there he really found what he had been looking for from the first--the complete antipodes of Northampton. And indeed Rome is the natural home of those spirits with which we just now claimed fellowship for Roderick--the spirits with a deep relish for the artificial element in life and the infinite superpositions of history. It is the immemorial city of convention. The stagnant Roman air is charged with convention; it colors the yellow light and deepens the chilly shadows. And in that still <b>recent</b> <b>day</b> the most impressive convention in all history was visible to men's eyes, in the Roman streets, erect in a gilded coach drawn by four black horses. Roderick's first fortnight was a high aesthetic revel. He declared that Rome made him feel and understand more things than he could express: he was sure that life must have there, for all one's senses, an incomparable fineness; that more interesting things must happen to one than anywhere else. And he gave Rowland to understand that he meant to live freely and largely, and be as interested as occasion demanded. Rowland saw no reason to regard this as a menace of dissipation, because, in the first place, there was in all dissipation, refine it as one might, a grossness which would disqualify it for Roderick's favor, and because, in the second, the young sculptor was a man to regard all things in the light of his art, to hand over his passions to his genius to be dealt with, and to find that he could live largely enough without exceeding the circle of wholesome curiosity. Rowland took immense satisfaction in his companion's deep impatience to make something of all his impressions. Some of these indeed found their way into a channel which did not lead to statues, but it was none the less a safe one. He wrote frequent long letters to Miss Garland; when Rowland went with him to post them he thought wistfully of the fortune of the great loosely-written missives, which cost Roderick unconscionable sums in postage. He received punctual answers of a more frugal form, written in a clear, minute hand, on paper vexatiously thin. If Rowland was present when they came, he turned away and thought of other things--or tried to. These were the only moments when his sympathy halted, and they were brief. For the rest he let the days go by unprotestingly, and enjoyed Roderick's serene efflorescence as he would have done a beautiful summer sunrise. Rome, for the past month, had been delicious. The annual descent of the Goths had not yet begun, and sunny leisure seemed to brood over the city.|$|E

In particular the principal investigators {{are interested in the}} extent of participation in different kinds of day trips, how frequently particular types of trip are undertaken, and associated expenditure. The survey also seeks to provide information on a number of other trip details, such as activities undertaken, areas visited, time spent at the main destination, modes of transport, distance travelled, number of people involved and the trip party composition. Respondents to the survey are generally asked to recall trips taken within the past two weeks. The 1994 survey covered three main types of trip : home-based trips - trips made from home for leisure activities, which start and finish on the same day (i. e. do not include an overnight stay); visits made from home on business - day trips for business purposes for special or one-off purposes such as attending a conference for the day; holiday-based trips - day trips made from a holiday base in the UK, taken while staying away from home. Main Topics : The following information is included: record of all day trips from home in the last two weeks; record of all day trips from holiday base in the last two weeks; details of up to 7 most <b>recent</b> <b>day</b> trips from home in the last two weeks; details of up to 7 most <b>recent</b> <b>day</b> trips from holiday base in the last two weeks; details of up to 7 most <b>recent</b> <b>day</b> trips for business purposes in the last two weeks; details of <b>recent</b> <b>day</b> trips in the last 12 months to a town, seaside, countryside, wood, or river.

40|$|Background: Informal caregiving by {{relatives}} {{is a great}} {{resource for}} individuals {{as well as for}} society, but the caregiving role is associated with health problems for the caregiver. This study aimed to compare caregivers' self-rated health, number of <b>recent</b> <b>days</b> with poor health and psychological wellbeing with that of non-caregivers in a general Swedish population. Methods: From 2004 to 2013, 90, 845 Swedish people completed a postal questionnaire about their health, number of <b>recent</b> <b>days</b> with poor health during last month, psychological wellbeing and if they were performing caregiving or not. Descriptive statistics, chi-square analysis, ANOVA, logistic regressions and negative binomial regression models were used to investigate associations between being a caregiver or not and health and wellbeing. Negative binomial regression was used to assess the relation between caregiver status and <b>recent</b> <b>days</b> with poor health or functioning. Results: Eleven percent reported having a caregiving role. Caregivers reported poorer self-rated health compered to non-caregivers, also in adjusted models; odds ratio (OR) : 1. 07 with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 01 - 1. 13. Caregivers also reported lower psychological wellbeing compared to non-caregivers; OR: 1. 22, CI: 1. 15 - 1. 30. Caregiving status was associated with more <b>recent</b> <b>days</b> with poor physical health and more <b>recent</b> <b>days</b> with poor mental health. Conclusions: This study suggests that caregivers have worse perceptions in self-rated health and psychological wellbeing compared with non-caregivers, indicating that the role of caregiver is adversely associated with health. This association also appears in terms of reporting days of poor health in the last month. The underlying mechanism of these associations, including the potential detrimental health effects of being a caregiver, needs to be investigated in longitudinal studies...|$|R
