5|$|Snow gauge: The {{first use}} of snow gauges were {{precipitation}} gauges that was widely used in 1247 during the Southern Song dynasty to gather meteorological data. The Song Chinese mathematician and inventor Qin Jiushao records the use of gathering rain and snowfall measurements in the Song mathematical treatise Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections. The book discusses the use of large conical or barrel-shaped snow gauges made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first <b>referenced</b> <b>to</b> snow measurement.|$|E

5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (<b>referenced</b> <b>to</b> ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{winning the}} 2010–11 Premier League title {{earlier in the}} day meant double pride for Manchester as its teams claimed both of English {{football}}'s blue ribbon competitions. Some football pundits debated whether the joint win – along with City's qualification for the Champions League – would mark the start of new era similar to the late 1960s when both City and United dominated English football; during that period, both clubs won the league championship once, with United winning the European Cup and City winning the FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup within four years. The '35 years' banner that had stood at Old Trafford, home of Manchester United which <b>referenced</b> <b>to</b> Manchester City's long trophy drought, was taken down in recognition of City's victory.|$|E
5|$|Tianchi Basins: As {{precipitation}} was {{for important}} agriculture and food production, the Song Chinese mathematician and inventor Qin Jiushao developed a precipitation gauge that was {{widely used in}} 1247 during the Southern Song dynasty to gather meteorological data. Qin Jiushao later records application of rainfall measurements in the mathematical treatise Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections. The book also discusses problems using large snow gauges made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first <b>referenced</b> <b>to</b> snow measurement. Tianchi Basins were installed at provincial and district capitals and bamboo snow gauges were situated in mountain passes. The rain gauges were conical or barrel-shaped with one being installed at each provincial and district capital in China. In the treatise, Qin Jiushao also discusses how point measurements were converted to real averages. These averages were important as they postulated indicators of natural disasters such as flooding, since river flooding {{has always been a}} problem in China.|$|E

5|$|For system {{efficacy}} and reliability, aircraft transmissions made {{in response to}} a signal from a satellite are sent in timed slots <b>referenced</b> <b>to</b> the time the signal from the satellite arrived, using the slotted ALOHA protocol. The time that the signal is sent from the ground station begins the time slot. The burst timing offset (BTO) is the time difference between the start of the time slot and the start of the transmission received from the aircraft; it equals twice the distance (for the ground station's signal then aircraft's response) from the ground station to the satellite to the aircraft plus the time the aircraft's SDU takes between receiving the signal and responding (the SDU bias) and the delay between the time the signal arrives at the ground station and the time it is processed (when the BTO value is logged; the ground station bias). The satellite's location is known, thus the distance from the satellite to the ground station can be calculated, while the combined bias of the SDU and ground station is relatively constant and can be calculated from signals exchanged earlier in the flight while it was on the ground at KLIA, thus leaving the distance between the aircraft and satellite as the only variable.|$|E
