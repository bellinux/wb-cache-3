40|$|ObjectiveFetal {{cardiac surgery}} is a {{potential}} innovative treatment for certain congenital heart defects that have significant mortality and morbidity in utero or after birth, {{but it has been}} limited by placental dysfunction after fetal cardiac bypass. We have used the TinyPump device for fetal cardiac bypass in sheep fetuses at 90 to 110  days gestation. MethodsTen mixed-breed pregnant ewes were used over a period of 6 months, and 10 fetuses were placed on bypass for 30 minutes. Five fetuses with a mean gestational age of 104 ± 4. 5 days and mean weight of 1. 4 ± 0. 4 kg were placed on bypass using the TinyPump device, and 5 fetuses with a mean gestational age of 119 ± 4. 5 days and mean weight of 3. 4 ± 0. 4 kg were placed on bypass using the <b>roller</b> <b>head</b> pump. The fetuses were monitored for up to 3 hours after bypass or until earlier demise. ResultsProgressive respiratory and metabolic acidosis developed in all fetuses. The TinyPump group had a lower gestational age and weight compared with the <b>roller</b> <b>head</b> pump group. However, the rate of postbypass deterioration in the TinyPump group, as measured with blood gases, was noted to be significantly slower compared with the <b>roller</b> <b>head</b> pump group. ConclusionsWe demonstrate the feasibility of the TinyPump device for fetal cardiac bypass in a fetal sheep model. The TinyPump group showed improved results compared with the <b>roller</b> <b>head</b> group despite more immature fetuses. The TinyPump device seems to be a promising device for future studies of fetal cardiac bypass in immature fetal sheep and in primates...|$|E

50|$|Robot hemming is {{utilized}} for {{the manufacture of}} Low to medium production volumes.It uses a standard Industrial Robot integrated with a <b>roller</b> hemming <b>head</b> to provide a flexible solution to closure manufacture. The flange of the outer panel is bent over the inner panel in progressive steps {{by means of the}} <b>roller</b> hemming <b>head.</b> The process allows the advantage of using the robot controlled hemming head to hem several different components in a single cell. Minor changes and modifications to panel hemming conditions can also be accommodated allowing a quick and cost-effective reaction.|$|R

50|$|Check {{scanners}} {{are used}} by banks or business through remote deposit capture programs to take a digital image of the check and send {{the information to the}} bank for deposit. This is where the image of a check on your bank statement originates. If a check scanner is not properly cleaned financial institutions risk increased transaction failures, equipment malfunctions, personnel costs to reconcile poor images, equipment repair or exchange and non-compliance due to poor image quality. A cleaning card designed to clean a specific model of check scanner is run through the device the same way the operator would run a check through the device. The cleaning card makes contact with the optical lenses, micr reader, transport belts and <b>rollers,</b> print <b>heads</b> and clears the check path.|$|R
50|$|SW6 922 {{was partly}} modernised at Preston Workshops in 1993. It {{was to be}} a {{prototype}} for rebuilding the remaining SW6 fleet with air conditioning, <b>roller</b> bearings, modern <b>head</b> and tail lights, fluorescent interior lighting, dot-matrix display and pantograph using many of the same components as used in the A2 and B2 class trams. It was designated the W8 class and renumbered 1101. The rebuild radically altered the appearance of the tram and the National Trust ordered the conversion be suspended before completion.|$|R
50|$|Some {{printers}} use {{a supplemental}} air-suction pump, utilizing the rubber capping station to suck ink through a severely clogged cartridge. The suction pump mechanism is frequently {{driven by the}} page feed stepper motor: it {{is connected to the}} end of the shaft. The pump only engages when the shaft turns backwards, hence the <b>rollers</b> reversing while <b>head</b> cleaning. Due to the built-in head design, the suction pump is also needed to prime the ink channels inside a new printer, and to reprime the channels between ink tank changes.|$|R
5|$|The long-tailed {{ground roller}} is a shy and elusive bird and, if {{seen by a}} human observer, it either freezes or runs away. As its short wings suggest, the species rarely flies, {{but it is a}} {{powerful}} runner. While largely terrestrial, it roosts in low trees and bushes, and sings from low perches. Long-tailed ground rollers are solitary outside the breeding season. Although diurnal, it does occasionally forage at night unlike most other ground rollers. When calling, this ground <b>roller</b> bobs its <b>head</b> and raises its tail. The long-tailed ground roller also raises its tail when it is excited.|$|R

In April 1949, he and Răutu were delegates to the Congress of Advocates of Peace under Mihail Sadoveanu (who reputedly eclipsed them both). That year, <b>Roller</b> rose to <b>head</b> the Agitprop section's {{education}} committee. This body was charged with writing school textbooks for use throughout the educational system, most of them translated from Russian. Under his direct tutelage, primary school pupils began learning about the [...] "new teachers of the working class" [...] (Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin), while Russian-language education began in 4th grade and continued through the third year of university.|$|R
5000|$|... 1985 - New black {{gearshift}} knob introduced (1982 to 1984 {{models have}} chromed knobs). Turn signal lever is now also black (1984 and below models were interior color keyed) {{with the exception}} of models with two-tone paint. A revised 5.2L V-8 now with a <b>roller</b> camshaft, swirl-port <b>heads,</b> and carburetor change from a Carter 2bbl to a Holley 2bbl increased horsepower from 130 to 140 and torque was also increased to 265 lb-ft (from 230). The interiors were given a make-over with plusher leather seats, headliners, and upgraded door panels featuring larger armrests with the power window switch's located on them, as opposed to being on the door panels separately.|$|R
5000|$|Jockeys {{who have}} ridden Holy Roller him {{say it was}} like riding in an old Cadillac, very smooth ride, {{tremendous}} suspension but when the stride lengthens in the straight, they get whiplash in their necks; they also refuse to dismount straight off his back but rather get down onto a handy rail if possible, then drop to the ground. Another problem during a race was that the jockey was often unable to see horses in front of Holy <b>Roller's</b> neck and <b>head</b> (hidden underneath), {{and would have to}} trust to the horse to get around and past the smaller horse safely. Jockey Larry Cassidy said often he would ask Holy Roller to go forward in a race but the horse would refuse, then move out sideways, and Larry would realise there had been a [...] "normal size" [...] horse in front of him but not visible from the saddle.|$|R
5000|$|The coaster sends riders 85 ft high up {{the lift}} hill {{alongside}} Wicked roller coaster, then into a smooth 1/3 right turn. Riders {{get a glimpse}} of the Wild Mouse and the Spider <b>roller</b> coasters before <b>heading</b> into a fast, twisting plummet to the ground, then through two 65 ft High-G inversions and two helix turns. The first helix turn is very large, arcing over the [...] "bridge" [...] or elevated part of the queue, then up and through the second loop. After that the train passes just over the station's roof, then down and around, turning diagonally between the two loops into the G-inducing helix back to the station. This helix is what some people call the 'slanted spiral' or the 'upward-downward helix,' because it turns downward, upward, then downward again at equal angles into a large turn that leads back to the station, giving the entire element a 'slanted' look.|$|R
25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing <b>head</b> <b>rollers</b> and {{transferred}} to the pins of the comb circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to the comb circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in the comb circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|R
50|$|At the beginning, {{during the}} {{synthesizer}} prelude, the clip shows a common British brick terraced house (as featured in Coronation Street) and then moves into May's bedroom. May is woken up by a Teasmade. He gets up, {{dressed in a}} pink shirt, pink socks and pink bunny-shaped slippers, with hair <b>rollers</b> in his <b>head.</b> The camera moves {{to the living room}} and the kitchen where Mercury is vacuuming the floor with a 1950 Hoover 119 Junior. He wears a black wig, pink earrings, pink blouse with a sizeable false breast under it, black leather miniskirt, knee-high and heeled shoes. During the trials Mercury realised that he couldn't walk freely in high-heeled shoes and settled on 2-inch ones. His own thick moustache remains in place (although he appears without it {{in the latter part of}} the video). May descends the staircase and goes to the kitchen. He passes Deacon, who is sitting on a couch, dressed in a black cloak, gloves, grey wig and a hat. Deacon reads a newspaper, constantly snorting and shaking his head. Taylor is busy with dishwashing in the kitchen, dressed as a stereotypical schoolgirl - blonde wig, white blouse, grey miniskirt, coloured tie and a straw hat behind his back. Mercury stops vacuuming and starts singing. Although he does not sing on the studio version of the song, Taylor can be seen lip-syncing some of the harmony vocals, which he did however perform in live performances.|$|R
5000|$|The Custom Cruiser was restyled in 1980 with a {{lower front}} fascia. The doors and window {{mechanisms}} were also redesigned to be lighter. The woodgrained side panels on models so equipped no longer followed the curves of the wheel wells like the 1977-1979 versions, but were positioned higher on the body sides to give a straighter, sleeker look similar to the first generation. 1980 saw the last restyling of the second generation Custom Cruisers.Minor mechanical changes were made between 1980 and 1990. The new E4ME electronic carburetor which used GM's CCC (Computer Command Control) system was introduced in 1980 for models sold in California. In 1981, all Custom Cruisers used the E4ME with the CCC system, although Canadian emission cars continued to use the mechanical M4ME carburetor until 1986. Also new in 1981 was GM's new Turbo Hydramatic 200-4R automatic transmission with overdrive. This transmission was equipped with a lock-up torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With the new transmission, the Custom Cruiser could be equipped with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range. 1985 saw major changes to the 5.0 L (307 CID) V8 engine's cylinder head design. Introduced were new [...] "swirl port" [...] heads, which improved driveability and low-end torque. These new heads also featured very small intake ports, which reduced the higher RPM power and performance significantly. Along with the new <b>heads,</b> <b>roller</b> lifters replaced flat lifters. The 1989 Custom Cruiser was the last edition to have front shoulder belts mounted in the B-pillars; 1990 introduced door-mounted [...] "passive" [...] shoulder belts.|$|R
