Henry's empire, however, did not survive long and collapsed during the reign of his youngest son John, when Philip captured all of the Angevin possessions in France except Gascony.

5|$|The matter {{ended in}} court, {{concerning}} if Autolink {{should be allowed}} to take control over four train radios that were located in locomotives owned by Autolink, but operated by Ofotbanen. In a shareholder agreement between Autolink and Rail Management, the ownership of the train radios had been transferred to Autolink, but the agreement has clauses that specified that Autolink could not start a competing railway company.

The parties agreed that Autolink, on 13 February 2008, had bought five shunters from Ofotbanen for NOK 12 million, of which NOK 9.5 million was paid by Autolink deleting debt.

5|$|Child labour in the industries, {{especially}} in match making factories, {{was at its}} peak during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, the child work force in the age group 4–16 was 30% of the total work force, 90% of whom were girls. In 1986, the National Child Labour project estimated child labour in Sivaksi match making industries to be 14,121 children. The estimates indicated 80% of the child labour belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), who were margianlised for centuries for cheap labour. Poverty and lack of farm produce were stated as {{the main reason for}} child labour. The employers also preferred children because of ease in management, discipline and lack of labour unions. The children in these industries suffered from back ache, neck ache, tuberclosis, malnutrition, gastointestinal disorders, dermatitis, respiratory disorders, over-exhaustion, burn injuries and water borne diseases due to exposure to harmful chemicals in the work environment. The situation of the child labour came to light during an accident of a bus transporting the children in 1976. The central government appointed a one-man committee under Harbans Singh in 1978, who reported abolishing child labour would seriously impact the economy of the region. The National Policy on child labour was formulated by the central government in August 1987, aiming at the rehabilitation of children withdrawn from these factories. In 1988, the union labour ministry initiated a programme for providing informal education, free health care and free lunch for children working in the factories. The Supreme Court of India, in a judgement <b>ruled</b> <b>on</b> December 1996 indicating provisions for preventing child labour like compensation for the child employed, employment to the adult members of the family and contribution to the corpus fund by the state government. From the establishment of child labour Act in 1986 till 2011, 150,000 inspections on child labour have been conducted in the factories, 1,500 cases have been registered and few prosecutions have been made. The results indicated small amount of child labour in cottage and house hold industries.|$|E
5|$|Even after Balliol's accession, Edward still {{continued}} to assert his authority over Scotland. Against {{the objections of}} the Scots, he agreed to hear appeals on cases <b>ruled</b> <b>on</b> by the court of guardians that had governed Scotland during the interregnum. A further provocation came in a case brought by Macduff, son of Malcolm, Earl of Fife, in which Edward demanded that Balliol appear in person before the English Parliament to answer the charges. This the Scottish King did, but the final straw was Edward's demand that the Scottish magnates provide military service {{in the war against}} France. This was unacceptable; the Scots instead formed an alliance with France and launched an unsuccessful attack on Carlisle. Edward responded by invading Scotland in 1296 and taking the town of Berwick in a particularly bloody attack. At the Battle of Dunbar, Scottish resistance was effectively crushed. Edward confiscated the Stone of Destiny – the Scottish coronation stoneand brought it to Westminster placing it in what became known as King Edward's Chair; he deposed Balliol and placed him in the Tower of London, and installed Englishmen to govern the country. The campaign had been very successful, but the English triumph would only be temporary.|$|E
