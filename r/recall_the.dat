5|$|A {{nurse at}} Dalldorf, Thea Malinovsky, claimed {{years after the}} patient's release from the asylum that the woman had {{told her she was}} another {{daughter}} of the Tsar, Anastasia, in the autumn of 1921. However, the patient herself could not <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> incident. Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky's claim, or weave it into their narrative.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{donations}} {{were also}} an issue. Bloomberg and Broad donated $350,000 and $250,000, respectively, {{to support the}} Senators. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee also spent $250,000 to oppose <b>recall.</b> <b>The</b> NRA spent over $108,000 to support the recall efforts. In total, the Morse and Giron side spent approximately $3,000,000 opposing the recall, while the recall supporters spent about $500,000.|$|E

In contrast, hate is discussed with verbs of reason and thought ("I think I know.../To say...").|$|R

5|$|The Summer Festival {{usually takes}} {{place over the}} fourth weekend of July. Events at the festival <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> lumbering history of the park. Log rolling, axe throwing, and {{cross-cut}} sawing events are held, as are horseshoe and seed spitting contests. Black Moshannon Lake is open to canoe races and fishing. A Saturday night bonfire party is held at the beach, with music and refreshments.|$|E

5|$|According to Burton Fisher, Puccini and Forzano {{borrowed}} {{heavily from}} the commedia dell'arte tradition in Gianni Schicchi. Schicchi himself <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> roguish Harlequin, while his daughter Lauretta, whose romance is nearly foiled by Buoso's relatives, resembles Columbina. Simone {{is drawn from}} Pantaloon, while <b>the</b> poverty-stricken Betto <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> buffoonish valet Zany. Doctor Spinelloccio <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> classic doctor from the commedia dell'arte, Balanzone even to his Bolognese origin. The Moor whose death momentarily scares the relatives, and his captain, are stock characters from commedia dell'arte.|$|R
5|$|There {{were two}} annual festivals in the city. The first {{to commemorate the}} day when the water pipe reached the city and the second to <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> date of the {{founding}} of the city. Both celebrations were instituted by Adud al-Dawla on the model of the holiday of Nowruz, the Iranian New Year.|$|E
5|$|A Project Leader {{is elected}} once per {{year by the}} developers. The leader has special powers, {{but they are not}} absolute, and {{appoints}} delegates to perform specialized tasks. Delegates make decisions as they think is best, taking into account technical criteria and consensus. By way of a General Resolution, the developers may <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> leader, reverse a decision made by the leader or a delegate, amend foundational documents and make other binding decisions. The voting method is based on the Schulze method (Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping).|$|E
5|$|Another {{composition}} {{from the}} song genre, also mentioned by Fisk and others, as intimately {{related to the}} last sonatas, and also depicting a feeling of wandering and homelessness, is the Winterreise (A Winter's Journey) song cycle. Numerous connections between different songs from the cycle and the sonatas, especially the C minor Sonata, have been mentioned. For example: in the C minor Sonata, the first movement's development section recalls the songs Erstarrung and Der Lindenbaum; the second movement and the finale <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> songs Das Wirtshaus, Gefrorne Tranen, Gute Nacht, Auf dem Flusse, Der Wegweiser, and Einsamkeit. These allusions to Winterreise retain the alienated, lonely atmosphere of its songs.|$|E

50|$|While Xuthus is inside, the Chorus of Creusa's {{servants}} prays to Athena and Artemis, <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> joys {{of fertility}} and raising children. <b>Recalling</b> <b>the</b> {{story of the}} daughters of Cecrops and Aglauros, they conclude that children born of mortals by gods are fated for ill fortune.|$|R
5|$|Burr, sensing {{an attack}} on his honor, and {{recovering}} from his defeat, demanded an apology in letter form. Hamilton wrote a letter in response and ultimately refused {{because he could not}} <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> instance of insulting Burr. Hamilton would also have been accused of recanting Cooper's letter out of cowardice. After a series of attempts to reconcile were to no avail, a duel was arranged through liaisons on June 27, 1804.|$|E
5|$|Charles Domery (later {{also known}} as Charles Domerz) was born in Benche, Poland, in around 1778. From the age of 13, Domery had an unusually large appetite. He was one of nine brothers, all of whom Domery said {{suffered}} from the same condition. Domery recalled {{that his father was}} a hearty eater and generally ate his meat half-boiled, but was too young to <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> quantity. The only illness Domery was aware of in the family was an outbreak of smallpox in his youth, which was survived by all the family.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto III was {{initially}} released in Australia with an MA15+ classification. After re-reviewing the game, the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) banned it, {{due to its}} depiction of sexual content and violence to prostitutes. This prompted distributor Take-Two Interactive {{to appeal to the}} OFLC, who reaffirmed the banned status on 11 December 2001, after reanalysing the game and seeking the professional opinion of a forensic psychologist. This prompted Take-Two to <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> game in Australia, and Rockstar to make appropriate changes to the game; a modified version was re-released with an MA15+ classification in January 2002, removing all instances of sexual acts with prostitutes.|$|E

5|$|Harp and Mayer {{conducted}} an experiment using a lesson about lightning strikes. The effect of lightning strikes on airplanes was added as a seductive detail. In {{six out of}} six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the strikes on airplanes demonstrated they were {{three times more likely}} to <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 poll {{conducted}} by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and publicized just two days before Russia's flag day (22 August), 56% of respondents stated that they felt proud when hearing the national anthem. However, only 39% could <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> words of {{the first line of}} the anthem. This was an increase from 33% in 2007. According to the survey, between 34 and 36% could not identify the anthem's first line. Overall, only 25% of respondents said they liked the anthem.|$|E
5|$|Later populist {{attempts}} to introduce similarly broad-reaching redistributive legislation enlisted {{the support of}} Gaius Marius, a great general, which was then elected to a string of unprecedented consecutive consulships, which also violated Roman law, which mandated a decade between consulships, further weakening the primarily norms-based constitution. The {{attempts to}} <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> general Sulla led to his marching on Rome in 88BC, installing two new consuls and forcing major reforms of the constitution at sword-point, before leaving a campaign in the East. This further strengthened the precedent that the Republic's constitution was malleable.|$|E

During the summer, Archie, Peyton, Eli, and eldest sibling Cooper run the Manning Passing Academy, a five-day camp which aims to improve the offensive skills of quarterbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, and running backs. In addition to the Mannings, the camp has included many prominent players from football as coaches, such as Colts wide receivers Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne.|$|E
5|$|Manual was {{initially}} a three-year school with some general academic classes and {{an emphasis on}} mechanical and industrial training. Although graduates <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> school being viewed as blue-collar and academically inferior to Male High School in its early days, numerous early graduates {{went on to become}} medical doctors, and students published a literary magazine called The Crimson from 1899 to 1955. In order to accommodate newly added French and Latin classes, Manual was expanded to a four-year school in 1901. In 1911, Manual became the first school in Kentucky to serve lunches to students.|$|E

Sculpted by Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, the medals recognize those immigrants' Viking heritage, depicting a warrior of that culture on the obverse and his vessel on the reverse.
