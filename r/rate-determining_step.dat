5|$|Kinetic {{measurements}} taken {{under various}} solution conditions or on slightly modified enzymes or substrates often {{shed light on}} this chemical mechanism, as they reveal the <b>rate-determining</b> <b>step</b> or intermediates in the reaction. For example, the breaking of a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom is a common <b>rate-determining</b> <b>step.</b> Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the kinetic effects of substituting each hydrogen by deuterium, its stable isotope. The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced, due to a primary kinetic isotope effect, which occurs because bonds to deuterium are harder to break than bonds to hydrogen. It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions, such as 13C/12C and 18O/16O, but these effects are more subtle.|$|E
25|$|Where the <b>rate-determining</b> <b>step</b> of a {{nucleophilic}} substitution {{reaction is}} unimolecular, {{it is known}} as an SN1 reaction. In this case, the slowest (thus <b>rate-determining</b> <b>step)</b> is the heterolysis of a carbon-halogen bond to give a carbocation and the halide anion. The nucleophile (electron donor) attacks the carbocation to give the product.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} protein {{disulfide}} isomerase (PDI) {{on the four}} structured des species that accumulate in the <b>rate-determining</b> <b>steps</b> of ribonuclease A folding were investigated at pH 8. 0 and 15 °C. The results indicate that PDI catalyzes {{the conversion of the}} kinetically trapped intermediates, des-[26 – 84] and des-[58 – 110], by reshuffling them into the on-pathway intermediate, des-[40 – 95], and the formation of native protein, by acting as both a chaperone and an oxidase on this on-pathway intermediate. These results provide the first strong evidence for the mechanism of PDI in the <b>rate-determining</b> <b>steps</b> of the oxidative folding pathways of ribonuclease A. Our approach, using PDI and blocked PDI, combined with the fast-blocking 2 -aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate method, may be generally applicable to the clarification of the effect of PDI on folding intermediates...|$|R

With simple Wittig reagents, {{the first step}} occurs easily with both aldehydes and ketones, and the decomposition of the betaine (to form 5) is the <b>rate-determining</b> <b>step.</b> However, with stabilised ylides (where R1 stabilises the negative charge) {{the first step is}} the slowest step, so the overall rate of alkene formation decreases and a bigger proportion of the alkene product is the E-isomer.

500|$|When enzymes bind {{multiple}} substrates, such as {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (shown right), enzyme kinetics can also show the sequence {{in which these}} substrates bind and the sequence in which products are released. [...] An example of enzymes that bind a single substrate and release multiple products are proteases, which cleave one protein substrate into two polypeptide products. Others join two substrates together, such as DNA polymerase linking a nucleotide to DNA. Although these mechanisms are often a complex series of steps, there is typically one <b>rate-determining</b> <b>step</b> that determines the overall kinetics.

30|$|Kinetics of the {{self-condensation}} of 2, 4 -dihydroxymethylphenol (2, 4 -DHMP) and 2, 4, 6 -trihydroxymethylphenol (THMP) {{were investigated}} to elucidate {{the mechanisms of}} the condensation of hydroxymethylphenols (HMPs). Rate equations were derived on the assumptions {{of the formation of}} quinone methide intermediates as unimolecular reactions and the occurrence of bimolecular reactions between undissociated HMPs, between undissociated HMP and dissociated HMP, and between dissociated HMPs. Rate constants were determined numerically by comparing the calculated reaction rates with observed ones. The results of analyses are as follows: (1) Both unimolecular and bimolecular reactions occur as the <b>rate-determining</b> <b>steps</b> during the self-condensation of 2, 4 -DHMP and THMP with low concentrations. (2) Nothing but bimolecular reactions occur as the <b>rate-determining</b> <b>steps</b> during the self-condensation of THMP with high concentrations. (3) Differences in the activation energy and the reaction rate due to the unimolecular process between 2, 4 -DHMP and THMP are small. (4) Rates of bimolecular reactions of THMP are about five times as large as those of 2, 4 -DHMP. (5) The values of the rate constants and the activation energy for the bimolecular reactions of THMP of low concentrations differ from those of THMP of high concentrations, indicating the difference in reaction mechanisms.|$|R
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Hammond's postulate and the BEP principle {{can be understood}} by considering a SN1 reaction. [...] Although two transition states occur during a SN1 reaction (dissociation of the leaving group and then attack by the nucleophile), the dissociation of the leaving group is almost always the <b>rate-determining</b> <b>step.</b> [...] Hence, the activation energy and therefore rate of the reaction will depend only upon the dissociation step.|$|E
2500|$|Since the SN1 {{reaction}} involves {{formation of}} an unstable carbocation intermediate in the <b>rate-determining</b> <b>step,</b> anything that can facilitate this will speed up the reaction. [...] The normal solvents of choice are both polar (to stabilize ionic intermediates in general) and protic (to solvate the leaving group in particular). Typical polar protic solvents include water and alcohols, which will also act as nucleophiles and the process is known as solvolysis.|$|E
2500|$|The SN1 {{reaction}} is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry. [...] "SN" [...] stands for nucleophilic substitution and the [...] "1" [...] represents {{the fact that}} the <b>rate-determining</b> <b>step</b> is unimolecular. Thus, the rate equation is often shown as having first-order dependence on electrophile and zero-order dependence on nucleophile. This relationship holds for situations where the amount of nucleophile is much greater than that of the carbocation intermediate. Instead, the rate equation may be more accurately described using steady-state kinetics. [...] The reaction involves a carbocation intermediate and is commonly seen in reactions of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or, under strongly acidic conditions, with secondary or tertiary alcohols. [...] With primary and secondary alkyl halides, the alternative SN2 reaction occurs. [...] In inorganic chemistry, the SN1 {{reaction is}} often known as the dissociative mechanism. This dissociation pathway is well-described by the cis effect. A reaction mechanism was first proposed by Christopher Ingold et al. in 1940. This reaction does not depend much on the strength of the nucleophile unlike the SN2 mechanism.this type of mechanism involves two steps the first step is the reversible ionization of Alkyl halide in the presence of aqueous acetone or an aqueous ethyl alcohol this step provides a carbocation as an intermediate in second step this carbocation is attacked by the nucleophile to give the product ...|$|E

40|$|A {{complete}} theoretical {{analysis of}} the ignition of shocked liquids ans solids requires {{a knowledge of the}} <b>rate-determining</b> <b>steps</b> corresponding to vibrational energy transfer processes and chemical reactions. Unfortunately, past studies of these steps have been hindered by the use of unrealistic reaction kinetics and by the complexity of the methods used for calculating rates of energy exchange. Here, a simpler quantum mechanical theory is described ans utilized for the calculation of rates of intermolecular-to-intramolecular vibrational energy transfer in shocked condensed nitromethane and PETN. An important quantity in this theory is the time tpv required for activation of the internal modes. Calculated values of tpv < 1 µsec are identified with the most efficient transfer of energy when nitromethane molecules interact and react bimolecularly and exothermically in the head-to-tail configuration. These times are consistent with those found in shock initiation experiments. A comparison of tpv with chemical reaction half-lives indicates that energy transfer and the bimolecular reaction alternate as <b>rate-determining</b> <b>steps</b> over the shock pressure and temperature ranges of 10 ≤ P ≤ 80 kbar and 335 ≤ T ≤ 850 K. From these results, it is found that a minimum pressure of P ≈ 58 kbar is required for the initiation of high-velocity detonation of homogeneous nitrométhane.

The metabolic pathway in the cell is regulated by covalent or non-covalent modifications. A covalent modification involves an addition or removal of a chemical bond, whereas a non-covalent modification (also known as allosteric regulation) is the binding of the regulator to the enzyme via hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and Van Der Waals forces.|$|R
2500|$|Van 't Hoff studied {{chemical}} {{dynamics and}} published in 1884 his famous [...] "Etudes de dynamique chimique". In 1901 he was awarded by the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry [...] "in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by {{the discovery of the}} laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions". After van 't Hoff, chemical kinetics deals with the experimental determination of reaction rates from which rate laws and rate constants are derived. Relatively simple rate laws exist for zero order reactions (for which reaction rates are independent of concentration), first order reactions, and second order reactions, and can be derived for others. Elementary reactions follow the law of mass action, but the rate law of stepwise reactions has to be derived by combining the rate laws of the various elementary steps, and can become rather complex. In consecutive reactions, the <b>rate-determining</b> <b>step</b> often determines the kinetics. In consecutive first order reactions, a steady state approximation can simplify the rate law. The activation energy for a reaction is experimentally determined through the Arrhenius equation and the Eyring equation. The main factors that influence the reaction rate include: the physical state of the reactants, the concentrations of the reactants, the temperature at which the reaction occurs, and whether or not any catalysts are present in the reaction.|$|E
