5000|$|The name Isca Dumnoniorum is a Latinization of {{a native}} Brittonic name {{describing}} flowing water, {{in reference to the}} River Exe. More exactly, the name seems to have originally meant [...] "full of fish" [...] (cf. Welsh pysg, [...] "fish"), although it came to be a simple synonym for water (cf. Scottish whiskey). This is also reflected in the modern Welsh name for Exeter: Caerwysg meaning [...] "fortified settlement on the river Uisc". The same name was used for the <b>River</b> <b>Usk</b> (modern <b>Afon</b> <b>Wysg)</b> in southern Wales, causing the settlement there (modern Caerleon) to be distinguished as Isca Augusta, while the Devonian Isca was called Isca Dumnoniorum: Usk of the Dumnonians.|$|R
