40|$|AbstractObjective: Postoperative anemia and {{multiple}} blood transfusions are still important problems in cardiac surgery. During {{the past few}} years, {{there have been some}} reports indicating that multiple <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> infusions starting at least 2 weeks before the operation induced erythropoiesis. We aimed {{to reduce the risk of}} adverse reactions of high doses of <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> and reduce the period of hospitalization by using it only once, 4 days before the operation. Methods: Twenty-five patients received <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> 4 days before the operation, and 28 patients comprised the control group. All the hematologic parameters of the patients are measured on the day of admission, the day before the operation (fourth day), the first day after the operation, and 1 week later. Results: In the <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> group the mean hemoglobin concentration increased on the morning of the operation (14. 5 ± 0. 52 g/dL in the <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> group and 12. 4 ± 0. 65 in the control group, P <. 05). To maintain hemoglobin levels at greater than 8. 5 g/dL, 330 ± 33 mL of homologous transfusion was required in the <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> group, whereas 680 ± 75 mL was required in the control group (P <. 01).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Erythropoietin {{has been}} shown to be {{protective}} against hypoxic-ischemic and inflammatory injuries in cell culture, animal models of brain injury, and clinical trials of adult humans. The rationale for our study was that early administration of high-dose <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> may reduce perinatal brain injury (intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia) in very preterm infants and improve neurodevelopmental outcome. We investigated whether administration of high-dose <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> to very preterm infants shortly after birth and subsequently during the first 2 days is safe in terms of short-term outcome. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-masked, single-center trial with a 2 : 1 allocation in favor of <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin.</b> Preterm infants (gestational age: 24 to 31 weeks) were given <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> or NaCl 0. 9 % intravenously 3, 12 to 18, and 36 to 42 hours after birth. RESULTS: The percentage of infants who survived without brain injury or retinopathy was 53 % in the <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> group and 60 % in the placebo group. There were no relevant differences regarding short-term outcomes such as intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. For 5 infants who were in the <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> group and had a gestational age of < 26 weeks, withdrawal of intensive care was decided (3 of 5 with severe bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage, 2 of 5 with pulmonary insufficiency); no infant of the control group died. <b>Recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> treatment did not result in significant differences in blood pressure, cerebral oxygenation, hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet count. CONCLUSIONS: No significant adverse effects of early high-dose <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> treatment in very preterm infants were identified. These results enable us to embark on a large multicenter trial with the aim of determining whether early high-dose administration of <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> to very preterm infants improves neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months' and 5 years' corrected age...|$|R
40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Anemia {{is common in}} {{patients}} with chronic heart failure, and is related to increased morbidity and mortality. The etiology of anemia in heart failure is complex and still not fully resolved. The review will describe current advances {{in the understanding of}} the pathophysiology of anemia and the potential therapeutic effects of <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin.</b> Recent findings Recent attempts to resolve the preponderant etiology of anemia in chronic heart failure have further defined its multifactorial nature. Impaired renal perfusion and function resulting in blunted erythropoietin production as well as impaired erythropoiesis in the bone marrow account for a vulnerable erythropoietic system. Moreover, fluid retention causes hemodilutional anemia. Correction of anemia with <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> seems feasible and is currently being evaluated in a phase 3 clinical trial. In addition, <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> improves cardiac function in chronic heart failure through the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells and exerts cytoprotective effects during acute myocardial infarction. Although <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> shows great promise, we should not neglect other treatable causes of anemia. Summary Although the etiology of anemia in chronic heart failure is clearly multifactorial, correction of anemia with <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> seems promising.

We aimed to demonstrate the glomerular protective effects of <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> using an in vivo rat cardiopulmonary bypass model and to explore the possible mechanism. MethodsDose-related renal protective effects of <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> were studied in phase I. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham group, cardiopulmonary bypass group, and 3 recombinant human erythropoietin–treated cardiopulmonary bypass groups (bolus doses of 500, 3000, and 5000 U/kg 24 hours before surgery). Blood and urine samples were collected just before surgery and at 2, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. In phase II, rats were divided into 3 groups: sham group, cardiopulmonary bypass group, and 5000 U/kg <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> group. Kidneys were harvested at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Ultra-organization of glomeruli was observed. Glomerular transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC 6) expression was studied by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Nuclei nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1 (NFATc 1) activity was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. ResultsPretreatment of 5000 U/kg <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> decreased the urine protein (72 hours: 7. 82  ±  1. 13 g/L vs 11. 28  ±  1. 73 g/L), serum creatinine (72 hours: 35. 0  ±  3. 5 μmol/L vs 60. 7  ±  7. 6 μmol/L), and cystatin-C (2 hours: 336. 5  ±  28. 2 μg/L vs 452. 6  ±  63. 8 μg/L) compared with the control group (P < . 01).

40|$|Despite {{improved}} survival, many preterm infants undergo subsequent neurodevelopmental impairment. To date, no neuroprotective therapies {{have been}} implemented into clinical practice. Erythropoietin, a haematopoietic cytokine used for treatment of anaemia of prematurity, {{has been shown to}} have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects on the brain in many experimental studies. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the effect of <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> on the microstructural development of the cerebral white matter using tract-based spatial statistics performed at term equivalent age. A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, prospective multicentre study applying <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> in the first 42 h after preterm birth entitled 'Does erythropoietin improve outcome in preterm infant' was conducted in Switzerland (NCT 00413946). Preterm infants were given <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> (3000 IU) or an equivalent volume of placebo (NaCl 0. 9 %) intravenously before 3 h of age after birth, at 12 - 18 h and at 36 - 42 h after birth. High resolution diffusion tensor imaging was obtained at 3 T in 58 preterm infants with mean (standard deviation) gestational age at birth 29. 75 (1. 44) weeks, and at scanning at 41. 1 (2. 09) weeks. Imaging was performed at a single centre. Voxel-wise statistical analysis of the fractional anisotropy data was carried out using tract-based spatial statistics to test for differences in fractional anisotropy between infants treated with <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> and placebo using a general linear model, covarying for the gestational age at birth and the corrected gestational age at the time of the scan. Preterm infants treated with <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> demonstrated increased fractional anisotropy in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, and the corticospinal tract bilaterally. Mean fractional anisotropy was significantly higher in preterm infants treated with <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> than in those treated with placebo (P < 0. 001).

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> on brain oxygenation in a model of diffuse traumatic brain injury. DESIGN: Adult male Wistar rats. SETTING: Neurosciences and physiology laboratories. INTERVENTIONS: Thirty minutes after diffuse traumatic brain injury (impact-acceleration model), rats were intravenously administered with either a saline solution or a <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> (5000 IU/kg). A third group received no traumatic brain injury insult (sham-operated). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three series of experiments were conducted 2 hours after traumatic brain injury to investigate: 1) the effect of <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> on brain edema using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and measurements of apparent diffusion coefficient (n = 11 rats per group); local brain oxygen saturation, mean transit time, and blood volume fraction were subsequently measured using a multiparametric magnetic resonance-based approach to estimate brain oxygenation and brain perfusion in the neocortex and caudoputamen; 2) the effect of <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> on brain tissue PO₂ in similar experiments (n = 5 rats per group); and 3) the cortical ultrastructural changes after treatment (n = 1 rat per group). Compared with the sham-operated group, traumatic brain injury saline rats showed {{a significant decrease in}} local brain oxygen saturation and in brain tissue PO₂ alongside brain edema formation and microvascular lumen collapse at H 2. Treatment with <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> reversed all of these traumatic brain injury-induced changes.

50|$|In {{infants with}} poor neurodevelopment, {{prematurity}} and asphyxia are typical problems. These conditions {{can lead to}} cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and sensory impairment.

While this is a normal phenomenon, it is also known that neurons in the developing brain are at an increased risk to undergo apoptosis in response to injury. A small amount of the RhEpo can cross the blood-brain barrier and protect against hypoxic-ischemia injury.

40|$|Summary: Therapy of renal anaemia in {{haemodialysis}} {{patients with}} chronic renal failure by application of <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> leads to an increase of the haematocrit. Rejuvenation of the erythrocyte population results in a decrease of the median density (D 50), an increase of cell age-dependent enzyme activities, such as aspartate aminotransferase, and elevated concentrations of purine nucleotides in the erythrocytes. After density gradient separation of erythrocyte populations into cell age-dependent fractions, the concentra-tions of adenosine-S'-triphosphate, guanosine- 5 '-triphosphate and guanosine- 5 '-diphosphate were be found to be elevated by 25 — 100 % in all cell fractions from haemodialysis patients, compared with a healthy control group. Therapy of haemodialysis patients with <b>recombinant</b> human <b>erythropoietin</b> leads to further increase (65 %) of ATP in the younger (low density) cells, {{but not in the}} older (high density) cells.

50|$|Many {{believe that}} the athlete {{passport}} provides an excellent alternative to ensure fairness in elite sports.

50|$|Nutritional iron {{deficiency}} {{is common in}} developing nations. An estimated two-thirds of children and of {{women of childbearing age}} in most developing nations are estimated to suffer from irondeficiency; one-third of them have the more severe form of the disorder, anemia. Iron deficiency from nutritional causes is rare in men and postmenopausal women. The diagnosis of {{iron deficiency}} mandates a search for potential sources of loss, such as gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers or colon cancer. Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia is treated by oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, or ferrous gluconate. When taking iron supplements, stomach upset or darkening of the feces are commonly experienced. The stomach upset can be alleviated by taking the iron with food; however, this decreases the amount of iron absorbed. Vitamin C aids in the body's ability to absorb iron, so taking oral iron supplements with orange juice is of benefit. In anemias of chronic disease, associated with chemotherapy, or associated with renal disease, some clinicians prescribe <b>recombinant</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> or epoetin alfa, to stimulate RBC production, although since there is also concurrent iron deficiency and inflammation present, parenteral iron is advised to be taken concurrently.|$|E
50|$|Erythropoiesis-stimulating {{agents have}} a history of use as blood doping agents in {{endurance}} sports, such as horseracing, boxing, cycling, rowing, distance running, race walking, snowshoeing, cross country skiing, biathlon, Mixed Martial Arts and triathlon. The overall oxygen delivery system (blood oxygen levels, as well as heart stroke volume, vascularization, and lung function) {{is one of the major}} limiting factors to muscles' ability to perform endurance exercise. Therefore, the primary reason athletes may use ESAs is to improve oxygen delivery to muscles, which directly improves their endurance capacity. With the advent of <b>recombinant</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> in the 1990s, the practice of autologous and homologous blood transfusion has been partially replaced by injecting erythropoietin such that the body naturally produces its own red cells. ESAs increase hematocrit (% of blood volume that is red cell mass) and total red cell mass in the body, providing a good advantage in sports where such practice is banned. In addition to ethical considerations in sports, providing an increased red cell mass beyond the natural levels reduces blood flow due to increased viscosity, and increases the likelihood of thrombosis and stroke. Due to dangers associated with using ESAs, their use should be limited to the clinic where anemic patients are boosted back to normal hemoglobin levels (as opposed to going above the normal levels for performance advantage, leading to an increased risk of death).|$|E
