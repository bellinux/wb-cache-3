50|$|The annual {{sediment}} load into the Cachi reservoir estimated at 0.81 million tons, which amounts to 1% storage {{volume of the}} reservoir, had been assessed {{at the planning stage}} to be distributed at 54% as thalweg deposits (flushed through low level sluice provided {{in the body of the}} dam), 21% getting deposited on the terraces, 18% flowing out through the spillway by gate operation and power intake through turbines and 7% trapped as bed load in the reservoir. This process is witnessed in two distinct parts of the reservoir - the upper part and the lower part - the upper part gets filled with sand and coarse sediments and the lower part, which is the deep river channel, gets deposited with fine sediment on its terraces which needs to be flushed by <b>reservoir</b> <b>operation</b> (a high concentration of sediments was noted near the power intake). However, for seven years after the project was commissioned, the reservoir was not desilted, which resulted in trapping of 82% of the sediment inflow into the reservoir and which moved towards the body of the dam and interfered with diversion of flow through the power intake in the body of the dam for power generation. The dam is provided with one scouring sluice at the bottom in the main river channel adjacent to the intake screen of the power intake that draws water for power generation. To keep the reservoir in a serviceable condition to derive planned power benefits, it became obligatory to drain the reservoir to its lowest level (though it caused an inevitable economic loss in power generation during the filling stage every year) and flush the deposited sediments downstream so that the intake does not get choked and allows sediment flow into the turbines. The first flushing operation was carried out in three well defined stages in 1973 and thereafter repeated every year till 1990. The downstream impact on the river regime as a result of the silt flushed from the reservoir was also studied when a peak concentration of 400 grams/litre were noted in the form of turbid water not only on the flood plains but also where the river merged with the Atlantic Sea. It was expected that these deposits would be flushed during the flood season. However, as a result of the silt flushing, some detrimental effect on the biota was noted by local people of the area in the downstream reaches of the river below the dam.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Additional demands are being placed upon reservoirs to meet a variety of diverse needs. These demands require efficient management of the limited storage through <b>reservoir</b> <b>operations.</b> This efficiency is most critical with water supply reservoirs. Reservoirs operated strictly for conservation purposes typically provide only incidental flood control. As the construction age of water resources declines, innovative strategies to utilize the finite water supplies Must be developed. Significant numbers of reallocations in reservoir storage between flood control and water supply pools have occurred in the past. Historically, storage transfer has increased the conservation pool at the cost of flood control storage due to the greater direct economic benefits associated with municipal and industrial water supply. This transfer can only occur in multipurpose reservoirs; however, the majority of reservoirs contain no flood control storage. This characteristic is fostered by the high (and generally rising) cost of including the flood control purpose in the reservoir scope. This investigation presents findings specific to operating strategies of reservoirs lacking flood control storage. The non-structural strategies applied include seasonal and permanent reallocations of water supply storage for flood control purposes. Lake Limestone in Central Texas serves as the case study. The highly variable conditions of the watershed commonly exhibit both hydrologic extremes, floods and droughts.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to develop and use a linked groundwater and vegetation model to simulate groundwater and vegetation distributions in a riverine and reservoir-fringe system under different <b>reservoir</b> <b>operations</b> scenarios. This study was conducted where Little Stony Creek flows into East Park Reservoir on the east front of the Coast Range, northern California. A numerical groundwater model was used to model mean depth to groundwater during the growing season for water years 1980 – 1999 for each of five community types identified on the study site. Multiple vegetation models were developed, each of which described the probability that a given community type would occur primarily as a function of modeled mean depth to groundwater during the growing season and secondarily as a function of flooding. Four scenarios representing four different <b>reservoir</b> <b>operations</b> were simulated: existing condition, existing condition with late drawdown, full drawdown, and full pool. A groundwater backwater effect caused by the imposed reservoir stage extends to portions of the terrace, but the most pronounced effects occur on the delta. Consequently, the most pronounced changes in vegetation distributions also occur on the delta. Compared to the existing-condition scenario, modeled vegetation distributions do not change under the existing condition with late-drawdown scenario, a xeric herbaceous community type is greatly expanded under the full-drawdown scenario, and mesic herbaceous, scrub-shrub, and forested community types are greatly expanded under the full-pool scenario. The results of this study are twofold. First, the linked groundwater and vegetation model is relatively simple to construct and can be used to efficiently simulate multiple surface-water and groundwater management scenarios. Second, changes in <b>reservoir</b> <b>operations</b> can have pronounced effects on shallow groundwater and associated vegetation distributions in riverine and reservoir-fringe systems.
