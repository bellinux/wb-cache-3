5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, over 100 western {{movies were}} filmed in nearby Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon. The Hotel Monte Vista in Flagstaff hosted many film stars during this era, {{including}} Jane Russell, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, John Wayne, and Bing Crosby. A {{scene from the}} movie Casablanca was filmed {{in one of the}} <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the hotel.|$|E

5|$|The first {{evidence}} {{of education in}} Giffnock is of a small private school that operated in the lodge house at the Redhurst Hotel. Due to the increased population, the first public school opened in 1902 in the Tower <b>Rooms</b> <b>of</b> Giffnock United Free Church, known now as the Orchardhill Parish Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundations}} of the last mansio built at the site, and its associated bath-house, were uncovered by archaeologists in 1912–13. The <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> both the mansio and bath-house were emptied and the stone foundations were exposed. This work left, in some lower stratified levels, traces of the two earlier wooden mansiones.|$|E
5|$|All five {{floors are}} {{connected}} by a central scale-and-platt staircase, added in the early 17th century to replace a turnpike stair in the south-west. The <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the upper floors have impressive panelling and decorated ceilings. The main hall, in the south part of the block, has been divided, but retains a large fireplace with the carved initials WS and JE, for William Sinclair and his wife Jean Edmonstone, and the date 1597.|$|E

5|$|Crash noted how Knight Lore masking {{technique}} addressed issues of flicker and attribute clash, and Sinclair User appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore sound {{to be its}} weakest component, though Your Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the castle require pixel-perfect precision, compounded by the anxiety of the running timer, and the game's animations would slow down proportional {{to the degree of}} onscreen action.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the Highfield {{location}} of the College meant it was directly in the war zone itself. With Southampton being attacked, the halls of residence were also under siege: at South Stoneham windows were blown in by bombs. The School of Navigation at the College was relocated to the communal <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> South Stoneham House {{for the duration of}} the war, and afterwards was moved to Warsash; in 1970 the school became independent of the University (instead it is affiliated to Southampton Solent University) and is known as the Warsash Maritime Academy.|$|E
5|$|During {{the liberation}} of Manila {{buildings}} of the University in Intramuros, {{as well as in}} Sampaloc were damaged or destroyed. The facility in Intramuros was burned on February 8, 1944. As for those in Sampaloc, though they were not destroyed, some portions were slightly damaged during the shellings, including the rooms on the West of the Main Building, some <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the Education building, and the University gymnasium.|$|E

50|$|<b>Room</b> <b>of</b> Mirrors is {{the third}} album by the Italian jazz {{musician}} and composer Kekko Fornarelli. It was released in 2011 by AUAND records and distributed by Egea. <b>Room</b> <b>of</b> Mirrors is inspired by the Swedish musician Esbjorn Svensson.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the female}} {{claim to the}} {{principal}} <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the corps de logis, the library and dining room were relocated to a secondary wing not built until much later. This secondary wing {{is linked to the}} west of corps de logis by a large arcaded loggia; originally open, it is now glazed and known as the Winter Garden. A later secondary wing, known as the Shuvalov wing (named after Vorontsov's son-in-law, Count Shuvalov) was not part of Blore's original plan and designed by his assistant, William Hunt.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{the commune}} had eight primary schools with 19 {{teachers}} for 595 children. There were 20 mahadras, or traditional schools, in 11 locations. Only four had a library or document repository. There were 11 writing <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> varying quality, and one small vocational training centre. By 2007, the commune had 11 primary schools with 689 students (45percent {{of whom were}} girls) and 28 teachers, but no secondary school. Only three schools had desks. All had latrines, but not all had drinking water or facilities for preparing meals for the children. The quality of education was mixed.|$|E
5|$|Roman baths {{played a}} leading role in the {{development}} of domed construction in general, and monumental domes in particular. Modest domes in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in Pompeii, in the cold <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the Terme Stabiane and the Terme del Foro. These domes are very conical in shape, similar to those on an Assyrian bas-relief found in Nineveh. At a Roman era tepidarium in Cabrera de Mar, Spain, a dome has been identified from the middle of the 2nd century BC that used a refined version of the parallel arch construction found in an earlier Hellenistic bath dome in Sicily. According to Vitruvius, the temperature and humidity of domed warm rooms could be regulated by raising or lowering bronze discs located under an oculus. Domes were particularly well suited to the hot <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> baths circular in plan to facilitate even heating from the walls. However, the extensive use of domes did not occur before the 1st century AD.|$|E

5|$|The 200 guest <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the {{original}} hotel {{were divided into}} four two-story motel wings, each with fifty rooms, and named after famous race tracks. They were set out in a hacienda style, and surrounded by a half-moon shaped pool. The suites were luxuriously designed. Plush blue carpets and ivory colored chairs with white ceilings were the norm in the early days. An electric tram service, often attended by pretty showgirls, took the guests to their rooms. A 14-story tower commenced construction in late 1965, and was opened in 1967. It existed until November 1996 when it was demolished.|$|E
5|$|The Palace of Frets {{is located}} on the fourth terrace of the Acropolis. The south facade of the palace is {{decorated}} with four large stepped frets. On {{the east side of the}} palace a stairway leads to a decorated throne of stone and stucco. One of the <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the palace contains a stucco decoration representing feathered serpents and crossed bones.|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} {{has also}} been used in other styles of architecture. For instance, Leonardo da Vinci sketched this shape as the plan for a fortification. A modern high-rise building, the Kölntriangle in Cologne, Germany, was built with a Reuleaux triangle cross-section. Together with the circular shape of its core, this gives varied depths to the <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the building.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} still-standing glulam roof structures is generally acknowledged to be the assembly <b>room</b> <b>of</b> King Edward VI College, a school in Bugle Street, Southampton, England, dating from 1866, designed by Josiah George Poole. The building is now the Marriage <b>Room</b> <b>of</b> Southampton Register Office.|$|R

5|$|The Sala das Mangas (the only room in {{the state}} apartments to fully survive the 1934 fire) is a long gallery lined with tiled wall panels (illustrated below). The gallery leads to the enfilade of state rooms, {{all of which have}} been fully restored. The formal <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the palace consist of three large halls: The Hall of Ambassadors, The Music Room and the Ball Room. Other smaller rooms include the Gun Room (where hunting parties would assemble), which is a frescoed salon painted with trees and foliage by Pillement.|$|E
5|$|The Scarborough School {{was founded}} in 1913 by Frank and Narcissa Vanderlip for their six {{children}} {{and the children of}} friends and neighbors. Having met educator Maria Montessori during their European travels, the Vanderlips pioneered the Montessori method at the Edward Harden Mansion in nearby Sleepy Hollow by creating the first Montessori school in the United States, in 1912. Frank Vanderlip's sister Ruth was married to Harden; the families maintained close ties. After a year existing in two <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the Harden residence, the school moved to the River Gate House {{at the north end of}} River Road and the Beechwood estate.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of seals of Shepseskare in the oldest part of Neferefre's mortuary temple could {{indicate that the}} former also undertook construction works there. The evidence for such works is uncertain: these seals could have been placed on boxes which were later moved into the magazine <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the temple. For example, seals of Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai were {{also found in the}} temple, while these three pharaohs died before Neferefre's reign.|$|E
