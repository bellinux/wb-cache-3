40|$|Since {{the skin}} effect will {{increase}} the propagation delay in an interconnect, it will also affect how to optimally select the number {{and size of the}} buffers. Failing to include the skin effect during buffer design may result in as much as 35 % extra delay compared to the optimal <b>repeater</b> <b>chain.</b> We present a new method with closed-form expressions for repeater insertion where we take into account the skin effect and also the relationship between interconnect resistance, capacitance and inductance that are determined from the geometrical parameters. We also investigate the skin-effect influence on power dissipation for an optimally designed <b>repeater</b> <b>chain,</b> and find that the increase is at most 10 % of the dynamic power dissipation...|$|E
40|$|We analyze an entanglement-based quantum key {{distribution}} (QKD) architecture that uses a linear chain of quantum repeaters employing photon-pair sources, spectral-multiplexing, linear-optic Bell-state measurements, multi-mode quantum memories and classical-only error correction. Assuming perfect sources, we find an exact expression for the secret-key rate, and an analytical description of how errors propagate through the <b>repeater</b> <b>chain,</b> {{as a function of}} various loss and noise parameters of the devices. We show via an explicit analytical calculation, which separately addresses the effects of the principle non-idealities, that this scheme achieves a secret key rate that surpasses the TGW bound [...] -a recently-found fundamental limit to the rate-vs. -loss scaling achievable by any QKD protocol over a direct optical link [...] -thereby providing one of the first rigorous proofs of the efficacy of a repeater protocol. We explicitly calculate the end-to-end shared noisy quantum state generated by the <b>repeater</b> <b>chain,</b> which could be useful for analyzing the performance of other non-QKD quantum protocols that require establishing long-distance entanglement. We evaluate that shared state's fidelity and the achievable entanglement distillation rate, {{as a function of the}} number of repeater nodes, total range, and various loss and noise parameters of the system. We extend our theoretical analysis to encompass sources with non-zero two-pair-emission probability, using an efficient exact numerical evaluation of the quantum state propagation and measurements. We expect our results to spur formal rate-loss analysis of other repeater protocols, and also to provide useful abstractions to seed analyses of quantum networks of complex topologies.

40|$|We {{consider}} quantum {{and private}} communications assisted by repeaters, from the basic scenario {{of a single}} <b>repeater</b> <b>chain</b> to the general case of an arbitrarily-complex quantum network, where systems may be routed through single or multiple paths. In this context, we investigate the ultimate rates at which two end-parties may transmit quantum information, distribute entanglement, or generate secret keys. These end-to-end capacities are defined by optimizing over the most general adaptive protocols that are allowed by quantum mechanics. Combining techniques from quantum information and classical network theory, we derive single-letter upper bounds for the end-to-end capacities in repeater chains and quantum networks connected by arbitrary quantum channels, establishing exact formulas under basic decoherence models, including bosonic lossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing and erasure channels. For the converse part, we adopt a teleportation-inspired simulation of a quantum network which leads to upper bounds {{in terms of the}} relative entropy of entanglement. For the lower bounds we combine point-to-point quantum protocols with classical network algorithms. Depending on the type of routing (single or multiple), optimal strategies corresponds to finding the widest path or the maximum flow in the quantum network. Our theory can also be extended to simultaneous quantum communication between multiple senders and receivers. Comment: Results largely improved. Now includes the simulation and stretching of quantum networks connected by arbitrary quantum channels. The end-to-end capacities for quantum and private communication cannot beat a single-letter bound in terms of the relative entropy of entanglemen...|$|E
40|$|Variation {{of power}} and ground levels affect VLSI circuit performance. Trends in device {{technology}} and in packaging have necessitated a revision in conventional delay models. In particular, simple scalable models are needed to predict delays {{in the presence of}} uncorrelated power and ground noise. In this paper, we analyze the effect of such noise on signal propagation through a buffer and present simple, closed-form formulas to estimate the corresponding change of delay. The model captures both positive (slowdown) and negative (speedup) delay changes. It is consistent with short-channel MOSFET behavior, including carrier velocity saturation effects. An application shows that <b>repeater</b> <b>chains</b> using buffers instead of inherently faster inverters tend to have superior supply levelinduced jitter characteristics.

40|$|Remote quantum {{entanglement}} can enable numerous applications including distributed quantum computation, secure communication, and precision sensing. In this paper, we consider how a quantum network-nodes equipped with limited quantum processing capabilities connected via lossy optical links-can distribute high-rate entanglement simultaneously between multiple pairs of users (multiple flows). We develop protocols for such quantum "repeater" nodes, which enable {{a pair of}} users to achieve large gains in entanglement rates over using a linear <b>chain</b> of quantum <b>repeaters,</b> by exploiting the diversity of multiple paths in the network. Additionally, we develop repeater protocols that enable multiple user pairs to generate entanglement simultaneously at rates that can far exceed what is possible with repeaters time sharing among assisting individual entanglement flows. Our {{results suggest that the}} early-stage development of quantum memories with short coherence times and implementations of probabilistic Bell-state measurements can have a much more profound impact on quantum networks than may be apparent from analyzing linear <b>repeater</b> <b>chains.</b> This framework should spur the development of a general quantum network theory, bringing together quantum memory physics, quantum information theory, and computer network theory.

40|$|Trends in CMOS Technology and VLSI {{architectures}} {{are causing}} interconnect {{to play an}} increasing role in overall performance and power consumption. Repeaters are a classical approach to managing interconnect delay and are now commonly used for interconnect planning and global routing (both manually and in CAD tools). By automating repeater placement in the inner loop of a CAD tool, much more aggressive timing goals can be targeted early in the design process. However the classical approaches to repeater insertion (number, spacing and sizing) are increasingly inadequate due to 1) short-channel devices, 2) resistance, coupling and inductance in interconnects and 3) constraints on {{the placement of the}} repeaters. In this paper, we use a new short-channel MOS delay model to develop closed-form expressions for repeater insertion parameters. In particular, we focus on the effects of repeater placement constraints on the overall delay of the repeated interconnect. We show how worst-case placement scenarios can actually arise in realistic VLSI floorplans resulting in significant variation in the delay. We then explore methods of mitigating these eddects by adjusting the number and sizing of the repeaters. Closed form expressions for all design parameters can be used to develop repeater insertion utilities {{as part of a larger}} interconnect planning or global routing tool. Our analytical delay models for a wide range of <b>repeater</b> <b>chains</b> have been veridied to be within 5 % of SPICE simulations of a commercial 0. 13 Âµm CMOS technology...|$|R
5000|$|Wireless range-extenders or {{wireless}} repeaters {{can extend}} {{the range of}} an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected through repeaters will suffer from an increased latency for each hop, {{as well as from}} a reduction in the maximum data throughput that is available. In addition, the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless range-extenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case where but a single user migrates around a network employing extenders. For this reason, wireless range-extenders work best in networks supporting very low traffic throughput requirements, such as for cases where but a single user with a Wi-Fi equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and non-extended portions of the total connected network. Additionally, a wireless device connected to any of the <b>repeaters</b> in the <b>chain</b> will have a data throughput that is also limited by the [...] "weakest link" [...] existing in the chain between where the connection originates and where the connection ends. Networks employing wireless extenders are also more prone to degradation from interference from neighboring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network.|$|R
