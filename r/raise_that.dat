5|$|Prior to the game, Tennessee coach Fulmer {{pronounced}} himself unsatisfied {{with the}} Vols' performance in opponents' red zone {{during the regular}} season. Tennessee scored on just 36 of 52 possessions inside the opposition's 20-yard line, a conversion rate of 69.2 percent. Fulmer vowed to <b>raise</b> <b>that</b> percentage to {{what it had been}} the previous season, when Tennessee converted 41 of 46 possessions, or 89.1 percent.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) asks Michael for a 10 percent raise due to {{the extra}} {{workload}} resulting from Roy's absence. When he discovers that the raise would make him higher-paid than Michael, Darryl goads Michael into going to Corporate to negotiate his own raise. Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) initially tries to keep their romantic relationship out of the negotiations but ultimately gives Michael the maximum 12 percent <b>raise</b> <b>that</b> was authorized despite his continued inability to negotiate properly.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Nordale hired {{a recent}} University of Alaska Fairbanks {{graduate}} named Bob Bartlett. Bartlett {{had worked for}} the paper during school vacations, but he made journalism a full-time job following graduation. For four years, Bartlett was the only reporter (other than the editor) who regularly wrote local stories. In late 1930, Bartlett was made the paper's assistant editor in lieu of a <b>raise</b> <b>that</b> the paper couldn't afford to pay. Bartlett remained the paper's assistant editor until 1933, when he became the secretary to Anthony Dimond, Alaska's delegate to the U.S. Congress. Bartlett became the delegate to Congress in 1945, and in 1958, when Alaska hosted its first election for state office, Bartlett was elected one of its first two U.S. Senators.|$|E

5|$|Several {{weeks after}} Johnson's defeat of rival Georgia, Georgia Tech rewarded Johnson {{with a new}} {{contract}} worth $17.7 million, a 53% <b>raise</b> <b>that</b> made him the second highest paid coach in the ACC before he had even completed {{his first year in}} the conference. In 2009, Johnson led the Yellow Jackets to their first win over Florida State in Tallahassee in school history, a 49-44 shootout that featured over 1000 total yards between the two teams. One week later, Johnson defeated No. 4 Virginia Tech 28-23 at Bobby Dodd Stadium. The win broke an 0–17 losing streak to top five opponents at Grant Field in the past 47 years. On October 24, 2009, Johnson led the Yellow Jackets to their first win against the Virginia Cavaliers in Charlottesville, Virginia since 1990. At Duke University Johnson and his team clinched the ACC Coastal Division {{for the first time since}} 2006. Still, Johnson and company could not win their second game in a row over hated Georgia as the Bulldogs upset Tech 30–24 in the final home game of the season in 2009. On December 5 the Jackets defeated the Clemson Tigers to make them ACC champions, a title that would be vacated on July 14, 2011 due to NCAA infractions. The Yellow Jackets went on to lose to Iowa in the Orange Bowl, 24-14.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 {{the owners}} and {{operators}} of Playgirl.com and scores of other adult sites were charged by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with illegally billing thousands of consumers for services that were advertised as free, and for billing other consumers who never visited the web sites at all. Nevadan Voice Media Incorporated, which ran several adult sites, was also charged by the Commission. Sites often suffer from unauthorized, non-paying surfers who use stolen passwords, which can use month's worth of bandwidth in a day, costing the site operator {{hundreds or thousands of}} dollars' worth of additional bandwidth fees, all for traffic that returns no money at all. The 2002 Paragon Electric Co., Inc. v.

He declined and urged the directors to appoint Bennett. Lind, who was Goldschmidt's wife, wrote that Bennett [...] "is certainly the only man in England who ought to <b>raise</b> <b>that</b> institution from its present decay".|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Kreacher the house-elf, who {{was included in}} the script only at Rowling's request, has a larger part in the book than the film. In the novel, he is seen saving some of the Black family's artefacts which the Order of the Phoenix throw away, one of which is a locket which becomes extremely important in the seventh book. [...] "It was kind of tricky to <b>raise</b> <b>that</b> in our story, because it's for so much later", Yates said. [...] "We figured we can probably introduce it later, and that's the approach we took". Whilst Kreacher remained, all scenes involving Dobby were cut, and his important actions given to other characters.|$|E
500|$|Before the [...] season, Ellis {{publicly}} criticized Yankees owner George Steinbrenner {{for giving}} him a <b>raise</b> <b>that</b> was inadequate given his 1976 performance and for interfering with manager Billy Martin. As Ellis refused to sign his contract, and the Yankees {{did not want to}} have players who could become free agents, the Yankees traded Ellis with Larry Murray and Marty Perez to the Oakland Athletics for Mike Torrez in April 1977. Torrez emerged as a top starting pitcher for the Yankees that season, while Ellis struggled. While pitching for Oakland, the team asked him to keep charts. Defiant, Ellis set the charts on fire in the clubhouse, setting off sprinklers. Ellis ranked this as the [...] "craziest" [...] thing he did during his career.|$|E

Side missions include hot-rod races against a demon, defending Eddie's allies from a pending attack, or helping a cannon operator spot his targets. There are about 23 main missions in the story with 30 side missions that the player can optionally take. [...] The player can also explore the game's world to find statues bound in leather or chains that can be freed to gain a health boost for Eddie or to reveal part of the game's backstory, and can look through special telescopes at vistas or complete certain jumps to earn additional Fire Tributes.

2500|$|Stone was {{introduced}} to Gary Kellgren, a recording engineer working at several New York City recording studios on sessions for musicians such as Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix. Stone and Kellgren met because Kellgren's wife Marta was seven months pregnant and scared of the upcoming birth. Mutual friends thought that the two couples could talk about being parents and ease Marta's worry. Though they were [...] "diametrically opposed" [...] in nature, with Stone all business and Kellgren very creative, the two quickly became friends. During his lunch hours, Stone visited Kellgren in the studio, and {{began to see that}} Kellgren was not making full use of his genius. Stone noticed that Kellgren was getting only 4 percent of the money that studios were charging, and he helped Kellgren <b>raise</b> <b>that</b> to 20 percent.|$|E
2500|$|Laird {{recalled}} that {{the publication of}} the first issue of his and Eastman's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic came about thanks to a loan the two secured from Quentin Eastman, Kevin's uncle. Although the two were able to pay him back swiftly, it led Laird to speculate about what could have been: [...] "if we hadn't gotten that loan from him at that point in our lives, it might have taken us a couple more months to <b>raise</b> <b>that</b> money from other sources, and who knows what might have happened differently {{as a result of that}} delay?" [...] It occurred to him that [...] "there must be so many times where a self-publishing venture can sink or float on the strength of" [...] a relatively small amount of money, so he felt a desire to use some of his [...] "good fortune, in the financial sense, to help people out" [...] (and, in addition to the creators, the Foundation also aids those [...] "involved in charitable organizations").|$|E
2500|$|The FRCP govern in {{habeas corpus}} {{proceedings}} {{to the extent}} that those rules are not inconsistent with federal statutes or the Habeas Rules. [...] Scalia stated that the Court did not identify any such inconsistency [...] "because there is none." [...] Scalia believed the forfeiture rule could not be inconsistent with traditional habeas practice because there was no applicable statute of limitations until AEDPA was enacted in 1996. [...] It was also consistent with Habeas Rule 5(b), which requires the State's answer to state whether any claim in the habeas petition is barred by the statute of limitations. [...] Finally, as Day had argued, forfeiture is also consistent with Habeas Rule 4 because that rule provides for sua sponte screening and dismissal by the district courts only prior to the filing of the State's answer. [...] Scalia believed that the Court's concern over whether district courts could ever raise the AEDPA limitation sua sponte under Day's construction of the Habeas Rules begged the question, by assuming that courts should be able to <b>raise</b> <b>that</b> issue sua sponte. [...] "That is precisely the question before us." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013 (H.R. 267) is a {{bill that}} was {{introduced}} into the United States House of Representatives of the 113th United States Congress on January 15, 2013. [...] It passed the House on February 13, 2013 {{by a vote of}} 422-0. [...] The act was intended to change some of the regulations in the United States surrounding hydropower by making it easier for smaller hydropower stations to be created. [...] According to the bill's proponents, current regulations are unwieldy and represent a significant hurdle to creating more hydropower plants. [...] H.R. 267 would alter those regulations {{to make it easier for}} smaller plants to get approval quickly. [...] The legislation also requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to study how to further improve the regulatory process. [...] H.R. 267 would amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) and the Federal Power Act. [...] Currently, hydropower projects the produce 5,000 kilowatts or less of power can avoid having to get certain licenses. [...] H.R. 267 would <b>raise</b> <b>that</b> amount to 10,000 kilowatts, facilitating the speed at which smaller hydropower projects could be built. [...] The existing rules mean that it takes about five years for hydropower projects to get approval, according to hydropower industry sources.|$|E
2500|$|These trends {{continued}} into Maier’s {{last year as}} Speaker. In 1949, ABC announced that {{they had decided to}} accept paid religious broadcasting. With this addition, the Lutheran Hour was now heard on 1236 stations worldwide. ABC and CBS also offered television facilities for the program. Several such telecasts were produced beginning with a local show over St. Louis’ KSD-TV on New Year’s Day, 1948. By end of year, 1949, the Lutheran Hour was broadcast from 55 countries to a potential listening audience of 450,000,000 in 120 different lands. Programming was translated into thirty-six languages, and plans were in motion to <b>raise</b> <b>that</b> tally to fifty. An agreement had been reached to add a 111-station Japanese Lutheran Hour to ongoing broadcasts in Spanish, Afrikaans, German, Chinese, Arabic, Slovak, Italian, Greek, Estonian, Latvian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Polish, Russian, and others. The broadcast could be heard in Australia, Latin America, throughout Africa, the Far East including much of Communist China, the South Pacific Islands and the West Indies, and all of Europe, including Soviet Eastern Europe and some of Asiatic Russia. The estimated weekly listening audience rose from 12,000,000 (Time, 1943), to 15,000,000 (Collier’s, 1944), to 20,000,000 people (Saturday Evening Post, 1948). Mail count continued to exceed the rate which had produced 450,000 items in the previous season, culminating in a record of 17,000 letters received in one day. All of this indicated success for Maier’s vision of “Bringing Christ to the Nations.” ...|$|E
