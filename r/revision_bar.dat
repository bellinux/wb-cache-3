These changes include those discussed with the NRC {{in a conference call}} held on January 28, 2000 to address public comments received during rulemaking as well as other minor editorial changes and clarifications.

Recent discovery of a data input discrepancy in the LS-DYNA 3 D input file led us to re-run the tip-over cases which, as proposed revised Table 3.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} ex vivo the accuracy an electronic apex locator during root canal length determination in primary molars. Methods: One calibrated examiner determined the root canal length in 15 primary molars (total= 34 root canals) with different stages of root resorption. Root canal length was measured both visually, with the placement of a K-file 1 mm short of the apical foramen or the apical resorption bevel, and electronically using an electronic apex locator (Digital Signal Processing). Data were analyzed statistically using the intraclass correlation (ICC) test. Results: Comparing the actual and electronic root canal length measurements in the primary teeth showed a high correlation (ICC= 0. 95) Conclusions: The Digital Signal Processing apex locator is useful and accurate for apex foramen location during root canal length measurement in primary molars.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to compare the prevalence of taurodontism in the permanent mandibular first molars of nonsyndromic children with hypodontia and supernumerary teeth with age- and gender-matched controls. Methods: The crown-body root ratios of the permanent first molars were determined from orthopantomograms of 83 children with hypodontia (>= 1 missing teeth) and 37 children with supernumerary teeth (>= 1 extra teeth) compared with normal case controls. Results: In children with hypodontia, only girls showed a significantly higher tendency for taurodontism compared to case controls (P=. 003), while boys with hypodontia showed a similar prevalence of taurodontism as controls (P=. 83). Children with multiple missing teeth were significantly more susceptible to taurodontism than children with a single missing tooth (P=. 004). By contrast, the prevalence of taurodontism in children with supernumerary teeth was {{not significantly different from}} that of controls. Conclusions: Compared to normal case controls, children with nonsyndromic hypodontia are more likely to show taurodontism of the permanent first molar teeth whereas children with nonsyndromic supernumerary teeth are not.

40|$|This is {{a pivotal}} moment in legal education. <b>Revisions</b> in American <b>Bar</b> Association {{accreditation}} standards, approved in August 2014, impose new requirements, including practice-based requirements, on law schools. Other external regulators and critics {{are pushing for}} significant changes too. For example, the California bar licensing body is proposing to add a practice-based, experiential requirement to its licensing requirements, and the New York Court of Appeals, New Yorkâs highest court, is giving third-year, second semester {{students the opportunity to}} practice full-time in indigent legal services programs and projects. Unbeknown to many, there have been significant recent changes in legal education that have added practice-based courses, or practice-based components to courses, in all three years of legal education. Increasingly, law schools are reaching beyond the JD to establish projects in which graduates learn while practicing law. The innovations include first-year courses in which students engage in actual legal work to help provide legal services to clients; technology clinics in which students use or build state-of-the-art technology to help pro se litigants more effectively represent themselves; diversified experiential courses, including âpracticums;â and post-JD âincubator,â âfellowship,â âresidency,â âapprenticeship,â and âjob corpsâ programs in which law graduates, and sometimes law students, practice and learn from practice. It is a dynamic period in which law schools, including through comprehensive strategic planning, should regain the leadership in facing the present and future challenges. The factors contributing to changeâfor example, the tough job market, reduced law school applications, interventions of regulators, U. S. News 2 Ì 6 World Report rankings and increased competition among law schoolsâare not likely to substantially change in the near future. Law schools are in, should be in, and will be in a period that calls for sustained innovation...|$|R
