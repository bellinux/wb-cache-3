50|$|In {{a finite}} {{projective}} plane π of order n, a <b>blocking</b> <b>set</b> {{is a set}} of points of π which every line intersects and which contains no line completely. Under this definition, if B is a <b>blocking</b> <b>set,</b> then complementary set of points, π\B is also a <b>blocking</b> <b>set.</b> A <b>blocking</b> <b>set</b> B is minimal if the removal of any point of B leaves a set which is not a <b>blocking</b> <b>set.</b> A <b>blocking</b> <b>set</b> of smallest size is called a committee. Every committee is a minimal <b>blocking</b> <b>set,</b> but not all minimal <b>blocking</b> <b>sets</b> are committees. <b>Blocking</b> <b>sets</b> exist in all projective planes except for the smallest projective plane of order 2, the Fano plane.|$|R

The construction relies {{on the use of}} blocking cones in the field reduced representation of PG (n- 1,qt), extending the well-known construction of linear <b>blocking</b> <b>sets.</b> This construction is inspired by the construction for minimal <b>blocking</b> <b>sets</b> with respect to the hyperplanes by Mazzocca, Polverino, and Storme (the MPS-construction); we show that for a suitable choice of the blocking cone over a planar <b>blocking</b> <b>set,</b> we obtain larger <b>blocking</b> <b>sets</b> than the ones obtained from planar <b>blocking</b> <b>sets</b> in F. Mazzocca and O. Polverino, J Algebraic Combin 24 (1) (2006), 61 - 81.
