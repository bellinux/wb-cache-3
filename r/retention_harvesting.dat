50|$|Variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> retains {{more than}} 15% of the {{original}} stand in both rolling and permanent pockets of untouched trees and refugia patches. Retained forest structure is composed of live and dead trees that enhance structural diversity, and provide a hospitable habitat for variety of living organisms that prevail in the unlogged forest. This silviculture regime provides post-harvest ecological structure while creating sufficient opportunity to plant and naturally regenerate valuable tree species for timber, as well as restore historical coniferous and/or deciduous tree dominance to the forestland. Some timber companies have restricted the use of variable retention silviculture to only poorly stocked stands of rare but valuable tree species.|$|E
30|$|We have {{integrated}} {{the variable}} <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> experiment {{with a series}} of other long-term studies and experiments in the Mountain Ash forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria. Indeed, extensive long-term research and monitoring pre-dated the implementation of the variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> experiment. This work has included a network of >[*] 160 long-term sites surveyed {{for a wide range of}} animal groups as well as vascular plants and bryophytes (Lindenmayer 2009). Many of these sites were first established in 1983 and have continued to be monitored more than 35 [*]years later. This network of long-term plots has provided important background information against which the results of the variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> experiment could be compared.|$|E
30|$|We {{surveyed}} 10 m {{wide belt}} transects {{to estimate the}} combined densities of giant sequoia seedlings and saplings and small trees (< 30 cm dbh) within each burned, <b>retention</b> <b>harvested,</b> and control site. We placed 10 to 20 belt transects approximately 10 m to 20 m apart with no overlap between adjacent transects. Belt transects were 1.2 km to 1.8 km total length for each wildfire, <b>retention</b> <b>harvest,</b> and control unit of each grove (total sampling area of 102 ha for all groves). Belt transects allowed us to: 1) cover a relatively large area within each location, and 2) include areas within designated giant sequoia grove boundaries that were not biased by proximity to mature giant sequoias. We estimated the total density of giant sequoia regeneration within a grove and treatment (wildfire, <b>retention</b> <b>harvest,</b> control) by dividing {{the sum of all}} counted giant sequoia seedlings, saplings, and small trees by the total area sampled for all transects for that grove and treatment.|$|R
30|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} are to: 1) examine the response of giant sequoia regeneration to wildfire (across a gradient of fire severities) and <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> (with prescribed burning), and 2) evaluate microsite variables (e.g., canopy gaps, solar radiation, soil moisture) associated with giant sequoia regeneration. For our first objective, we predicted that giant sequoia regeneration (seedlings, saplings, and small-diameter trees) increases following wildfire but only at moderate- and high-severity, or in response to <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> followed by burning (prescribed or pile burning). For our second objective, we predicted that giant sequoia regeneration is positively associated with canopy gaps, thinner litter layers, soil moisture, and direct and indirect solar radiation.|$|R
30|$|In Bearskin and Black Mountain groves, {{giant sequoia}} {{regeneration}} benefited from <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> followed by prescribed burning (both groves) and giant sequoia planting (primarily Bearskin grove). Giant sequoia regeneration is greatly increased following intensive tree harvest and logging that removes {{a significant portion}} of the forest overstory, especially in conjunction with post-harvest burning of understory fuels (Stohlgren 1993, Stephenson 1996). Benson (1986) found that in the nearby Mountain Home grove, giant sequoia regeneration increased dramatically following <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> but declined in subsequent years, possibly due to increased competition and desiccation. Group selection openings at Mountain Home did not enhance giant sequoia regeneration two years following thinning and burning treatments, likely due to below average precipitation following treatments (Stephens et al. 1999).|$|R
30|$|Variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> is a {{silvicultural}} system {{that focuses on}} retaining key elements of stand structure {{at the time of}} logging and is increasingly being used worldwide. We describe the design and establishment of a variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> experiment established in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. The experiment was instigated in 2003, and the work to date has shown that it has environmental benefits for certain groups of small mammals, birds, and vascular plants. The experiment has been integrated with an ongoing long-term monitoring program as well as other experiments such as those in post-fire salvage-logged areas. Collectively, the results of various studies suggest that the potential value of variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> extends beyond green-tree logging to post-fire salvage logging environments.|$|E
30|$|Our {{work has}} shown that {{variable}} <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> has positive benefits for maintaining and recovering populations of small mammals (Lindenmayer et al. 2010) and forest birds (Lindenmayer et al. 2015 b). It appears likely that variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> will benefit some species of native plants, particularly logging-sensitive resprouting species such as tree ferns (Ough and Murphy 1998), although further data collection {{will be needed to}} determine if initial patterns are maintained in the long term. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to determine if variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> might be effective for enhancing the conservation of arboreal marsupials such as Leadbeater’s possum. A key challenge for these animals is that the age of the trees in the retention islands is currently ~[*] 80 [*]years (having germinated after fires in 1939), but it will be 40 – 100 [*]years before such trees begin developing cavities suitable for occupancy by cavity-dependent arboreal marsupials (Lindenmayer et al. 2017). Notably, the generally positive outcomes from variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> extend beyond green-tree logging operations to those where fire-disturbed areas are subject to salvage logging, at least for forest-dependent bird taxa (Lindenmayer et al. 2018 c) and most likely also for vascular plants (Blair et al. 2016).|$|E
30|$|Our {{variable}} <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> experiment has {{now been}} established for more than 15 [*]years. For many years, {{it was the only}} example of variable retention in the wet eucalypt forests of Victoria and there was a general reticence to operationalize it more broadly across the State. This was despite parallel experiments and successful implementation in Tasmania (Baker and Read 2011). However, in 2014, this changed with the introduction of a target of 50 % of cutblocks in “ash”-type forests to be harvested using variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting,</b> increasing to 100 % if “operationally achievable” (Leadbeater's Possum Advisory Group 2014; VicForests 2017). Yet, despite having been shown to be operationally achievable (Baker and Read 2011; Lindenmayer 2007) and now having targets, implementation has been slow, with only 3.9 % of montane ash forest cutblocks in the Central Highlands Region listed on the 2017 Timber Release Plan for the following 5  years listed as being cut using variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> (VicForests 2017).|$|E
30|$|Both {{wildland}} fire and mechanical harvest {{have been proposed}} to achieve ecological restoration goals in giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum [Lindl.] Buchholz) groves of the southern Sierra Nevada, but their effectiveness on giant sequoia regeneration has received little attention. In the summer of 2010, we examined giant sequoia regeneration in four groves subjected to: 1) moderate- to high-severity wildfire in 1987 (Case Mountain, Redwood Mountain groves), 2) low-severity wildfire in 2008 (Black Mountain grove), 3) <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> (removal of all trees except large-diameter giant sequoia) followed by prescribed burning in the mid- 1980 s (Black Mountain, Bearskin groves), and 4) nearby unburned and unharvested (control) stands in all groves. Density of giant sequoia regeneration was greater in the moderate- and high-severity wildfire stands than control stands, {{but there was no}} difference in giant sequoia regeneration between low-severity burned and control stands. Stands thinned by <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> and prescribed burning had greater giant sequoia regeneration than control stands. Across all control and low- to moderate-severity wildfire stands, giant sequoia regeneration was positively associated with canopy gaps. In wildfire and <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> stands, giant sequoia regeneration was positively associated with distance to gap edge, direct and indirect solar radiation, and soil moisture. Our results corroborate previous studies in finding that giant sequoia regeneration benefits from fire. Both wildfire and prescribed fire (preceded by harvest or not) can serve to promote giant sequoia regeneration, providing that fire intensity is sufficient to create canopy gaps, increase understory light, and remove surface litter.|$|R
40|$|The Northwest Forest Plan, "New Forestry," and the "regeneration harvests" they {{prescribe}} {{offer some}} potential resolution to long-standing adverse perceptions of clearcut logging.

30|$|Within {{each of the}} {{harvested}} units (Bearskin, Black Mountain), wildfire areas (Redwood Mountain, Case Mountain, Black Mountain), and unburned and unharvested (control) {{area for}} each grove, we established three transects averaging 250 m in length (six transects total per grove, except Black Mountain with nine transects total). We situated each transect within an individual <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> unit or in an independent location of a burned grove, based on changes in topography, fire severity, and grove subunit boundaries. We established control transects within an adjacent unharvested and unburned area that was located within 250 m of a corresponding <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> or burn transect (harvest and wildfire transects for the Black Mountain grove used the same three paired control transects for comparison). We located transect locations > 25 m from the harvest unit boundary or fire perimeter and < 50 m from a mature giant sequoia (> 75 cm dbh). We situated transects a minimum distance of 200 m from neighboring transects. For the Case Mountain grove control transects, we used a 100 m minimum distance due to the limited amount of unburned area within the grove.|$|R
30|$|A {{fundamental}} part {{of variable}} <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> {{system is that}} retained structures need to be within the boundary of the harvested area of a cut-block and {{not confined to the}} edges of a harvest unit (Lindenmayer and Franklin 2002).|$|E
30|$|Other work on {{vascular}} {{plants and}} tree {{fall in the}} variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> experiment {{has yet to be}} published. However, preliminary data suggest that rates of tree mortality and collapse are limited, although further long-term monitoring will be required to confirm initial patterns. It is also currently too early {{to determine the effects of}} variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> on vascular plants. However, earlier work has suggested that retention islands are important for maintaining populations of key plants that are otherwise highly sensitive to conventional clearcutting operations. These include tree ferns whose populations can be significantly depleted in logged and regenerated areas (Blair et al. 2016) but persist well within retained islands (Ough and Murphy 1998).|$|E
30|$|There {{has been}} a range of major {{challenges}} in implementing and then maintaining our variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> experiment. Some of these are cultural and social whereas others are economic. First, many large-scale experiments are expensive to implement (Westgate et al. 2013) and this limits the appetite of governments to support them. To avoid this problem in the variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> experiment, we overlaid its implementation on existing timber harvesting schedules following protracted negotiations with private logging contractors and State Government officials. However, this meant the study took 5  years to be fully implemented and encompass all treatments within experimental blocks. During this time, there was a decline in funding, thereby making it particularly challenging to maintain the experiment and implement all treatments in all experimental blocks.|$|E
30|$|From July {{through early}} September 2010, we placed 5 to 10 sample points located {{approximately}} every 30 m along each transect (average: 8.3 points per transect; total of 20 to 27 sample points per treatment type: <b>retention</b> <b>harvest,</b> wildfire, control). In {{a few cases}} where space was limited, we adjusted the angle of transects (using a random azimuth) to accommodate their lengths within plot and grove boundaries. We centered a 3.5 m radius (38.5 m 2) regeneration plot on the centermost giant sequoia seedling, sapling, or small tree within the plot in order to evaluate associations between the centralized giant sequoia regeneration class and measured stand and soil variables. In each regeneration plot, we counted the number of giant sequoia small seedlings and small diameter (< 30 cm dbh) trees (which includes saplings). We also recorded regeneration of other conifer species and hardwoods. Each regeneration plot yielded a total sample area of 962.5 m 2 per treatment (in each grove) or 0.192 ha per grove (0.289 ha for Black Mountain Grove; 0.869 ha total in all groves). We divided regeneration plots into quadrants, and individuals of giant sequoia and other conifers were counted by size class: 5 cm to 50 cm in height (termed “small seedlings”), 50 cm to 140 cm (“large seedlings”), and > 140 cm tall and < 30 cm dbh (“small trees,” which includes saplings) (Brohman and Bryant 2005). We measured the tallest seedling of each tree species in each quadrant. We chose 30 cm dbh as the cutoff diameter for older giant sequoia regeneration in our study because no giant sequoias < 30 cm dbh were retained following <b>harvest</b> within <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> units of Bearskin and Black Mountain groves. Additionally, a dbh of 29.5 cm was the largest diameter of giant sequoia regeneration recorded within the <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> units of Bearskin and Black Mountain groves and the high-severity wildfire area of Redwood Mountain grove.|$|R
40|$|Ideologically similar {{samples of}} {{respondents}} in both regions exhibited comparable patterns of increasing mean acceptability ratings with increasing tree retention levels for all harvest prescriptions, except 30 - 40 % dispersed <b>retention</b> <b>harvests.</b> These comparable respondent samples also exhibited similar correlations between acceptability ratings {{and levels of}} harvest impacts by category, exhibiting the same associations between ideologies and preferred impacts across regions. Three exceptions showed that Tasmanians exhibited a greater range of sensitivity for certain impact categories: (1) ground habitat impacts, likely attributable to greater retention of down wood in all Pacific Northwest prescriptions, versus burning most down wood in some Tasmanian prescriptions for regeneration of commercial species; (2) logger safety, likely attributable to greater differences in actual safety levels across the Tasmanian prescriptions; and (3) wildfire risk, likely because the affected Pacific Northwest region has few historical wildfires. Utility functions were estimated for each region&#x 2019;s respondents and applied to the opposite region&#x 2019;s forests. This confirmed that both regions&#x 2019; respondents would agree about the lower acceptability of Tasmanian 30 - 40 % dispersed <b>retention</b> <b>harvests,</b> likely because Tasmanians retain only a percent of commercial species while felling all other trees, versus Americans&#x 2019; retention of a percent of all tree types, retaining more trees and more ecosystem components...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{regeneration}} following {{timber harvest}} {{is a principal}} source of habitat for early-successional birds and characterized by influxes of early-successional vegetation and residual downed woody material. Early-successional birds may use harvest residues for communication, cover, foraging, and nesting. Yet, increased market viability of woody biomass as bioenergy feedstock may intensify harvest residue removal. Our objectives were to: 1) evaluate effects of varying intensities of woody biomass harvest on the early-successional bird community; and (2) document early-successional bird use of harvest residues in regenerating stands. We spot-mapped birds from 15 April- 15 July, 2012 - 2014, in six woody biomass removal treatments within regenerating stands in North Carolina (n = 4) and Georgia (n = 4), USA. Treatments included clearcut harvest followed by: (1) traditional woody biomass harvest with no specific retention target; (2) 15 % <b>retention</b> with <b>harvest</b> residues dispersed; (3) 15 % <b>retention</b> with <b>harvest</b> residues clustered; (4) 30 % <b>retention</b> with <b>harvest</b> residues dispersed; (5) 30 % <b>retention</b> with <b>harvest</b> residues clustered; and (6) no woody biomass harvest (i. e., reference site). We tested for treatment-level effects on breeding bird species diversity and richness, early-successional focal species territory density (combined and individual species), counts of breeding birds detected near, in, or on branches of harvest piles/windrows, counts of breeding bird behaviors, and vegetation composition and structure. Pooled across three breeding seasons, we delineated 536 and 654 territories and detected 2, 489 and 4, 204 birds in the North Carolina and Georgia treatments, respectively. Woody biomass harvest had limited or short-lived effects on the early-successional, breeding bird community. The successional trajectory of vegetation structure, rather than availability of harvest residues, primarily drove avian use of regenerating stands. However, many breeding bird species used downed wood in addition to vegetation, indicating that harvest residues initially may provide food and cover resources for early-successional birds in regenerating stands prior to vegetation regrowth...|$|R
30|$|The {{implementation}} {{and maintenance of}} the variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> experiment in Victorian’s Mountain Ash forests {{has been a major}} long-term challenge and remains so. Nevertheless, the work has shown that this silvicultural system is operationally achievable and has environmental benefits for some key groups such as small mammals and birds and likely also vascular plants. Variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> has value not only in green-tree logging but also in post-fire salvage logging where the retention of patches of retained forest can provide valuable habitat for birds and plants. Despite these positive outcomes, important operational issues remain, including the severe negative impacts of high-severity regeneration burns on the integrity and condition of retained patches within cutblocks. The low percentage of cutblocks currently harvested using this silvicultural system (<[*] 4 %) is also of concern and appears to be {{due to a lack of}} motivation to implement the method rather than operational hurdles preventing uptake. More significantly, the ecological and economic context for variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> must be addressed. In some cases, including in the Mountain Ash forests, overarching issues like the sustained yield of wood production and the relative economic value of other natural assets (such as water) that are traded off when the forests are logged need to be carefully assessed.|$|E
30|$|A further contextual {{issue for}} the {{implementation}} of variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> relates to the timber availability and sustained yield. In the case of the Mountain Ash forests, widespread recent and past fires, coupled with extensive timber harvesting, have severely depleted the amount of forest available for sawlog production. This, in part, arose after the 2009 wildfires where 40 % of the timber resource was burned but successive governments failed to reduce the sustained yield in response to large amount of forest burned. A result of this was overcutting of the remaining green (unburned) forest (Lindenmayer 2017). We argue that whilst the widespread implementation of variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> would be a positive step, it would be unwise to do so without simultaneously implementing a major reduction in sustained yield. Failure to do so would result in a greater overall area affected by logging (as less timber is removed from each cutblock subject to variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting,</b> with more cutblocks are required to achieve the same volume) (Lindenmayer et al. 2015 a). Notably, logging operations in the Central Highlands Mountain Ash forests have consistently failed to achieve Forest Stewardship Council certification, in part, because harvesting is not deemed to be ecologically sustainable.|$|E
30|$|Importantly, similar survey {{protocols}} {{have been}} employed across our various studies and experiments. Therefore, collectively, the long-term monitoring sites, the {{sites in the}} variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> experiment, and the sites in the salvage logging experiment have enabled us to compare results between studies and hence across a major disturbance gradient (Blair et al. 2016; Lindenmayer et al. 2018 c).|$|E
30|$|Giant sequoia {{was a major}} {{contributor}} to seedling and sapling and small tree densities in stands exposed to high- and moderate-severity wildfire. In contrast, tree regeneration in <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> stands, low-severity wildfire stands of Black Mountain grove, and control stands in all sampled groves was dominated overwhelmingly by shade-tolerant white fir, and to a lesser degree, incense cedar. White fir dominates the understory of fire-excluded giant sequoia groves and mixed-conifer stands of the southern Sierra Nevada (Rundel 1971, Hartesveldt et al. 1975, Stephenson 1999, van Mantgem et al. 2006). Both white fir and incense cedar are shade-tolerant and relatively fire-sensitive species that benefit from low understory light, thick litter layers, and relatively high soil moisture of fire-suppressed Sierra Nevada forests (Gray et al. 2005, Meyer et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|The use of {{variable}} retention (VR) in Canada, the USA and Tasmania, the island state off southern Australia, varies widely.

Usually the aims are greater social acceptability for timber harvesting and improved biodiversity outcome...|$|R
30|$|Density and {{occurrence}} of giant sequoia regeneration were {{positively associated with}} or related to canopy gaps. Across all control and low- to moderate-severity wildfire stands, giant sequoia regeneration was positively associated with canopy gaps, especially small-sized (< 0.4 ha) gaps. Similarly in wildfire and <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> stands, density of giant sequoia regeneration was positively associated with distance to gap edge in all groves but not all size classes. Giant sequoia seedlings and saplings have been demonstrated to be largely associated with canopy gaps (Harvey et al. 1980, Stephenson et al. 1991, Demetry 1995), particularly in gaps exceeding 0.3 ha to 0.8 ha (Piirto and Rogers 2002). In the central and southern Sierra Nevada, canopy gap creation (0.1 ha to 1 ha in size) using group selection treatments followed by pile burning and sequoia planting resulted in increased growth of giant sequoia seedlings and saplings (York et al. 2004, 2011).|$|R
30|$|Cultural {{and ideological}} issues were a second major hurdle {{associated}} with the variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> experiment. Prior to, and during, {{the implementation of the}} study, extended field days were held to discuss the study with different stakeholder groups. These were useful but typically served to further entrench pre-existing views. Members of some conservation groups have long maintained a strong level of opposition to any timber harvesting of native forests. Such opposition extended beyond clearcutting to include any kind of logging operation, including variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting.</b> Conversely, traditional foresters and some private logging contractors opposed the experiment because of their belief that clearcutting was the most efficient and safest way to log Mountain Ash forests. Indeed, one of the treatment blocks initially established had to be abandoned because the retained islands were inexplicably logged, further delaying the full implementation of the project. Importantly, some senior officials from the Victorian Government championed the work; otherwise, the experiment would never have been established. Finally, ongoing budget and staff cuts within the Victorian Government, coupled with frequent institutional restructuring has created enormous challenges in maintaining collaborative working partnerships between university researchers and new staff from government agencies. One {{of the results of the}} high levels of churn among departmental staff has been that key management data have not been gathered such as information on additional costs of implementing variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> and the extent of reductions in timber yields from harvest units.|$|E

30|$|The {{variable}} <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> experiment has encompassed {{studies of}} a range of groups of organisms. These include small mammals and birds as well as work on vascular plant abundance, patterns of plant germination, and rates of tree mortality and tree fall. We did not monitor the response of arboreal marsupials in the experiment as areas with a high density of large old hollow-bearing trees and thought likely to support species such as Leadbeater’s possum are generally excluded from harvesting.|$|E
30|$|<b>Retention</b> <b>harvest,</b> group selection, {{and other}} {{mechanical}} methods are alternative management treatments for improving regeneration in giant sequoia groves and have several {{advantages and disadvantages}} {{compared to the use}} of wildland fire. Mechanical harvest is often a more precise method for creating canopy gaps to increase light penetration, remove competitors, and produce conditions suitable for growth of giant sequoia seedlings and saplings (Benson 1986, Piirto and Rogers 2002). It is not limited by fire safety or smoke generation concerns and may provide revenue to offset the cost of forest restoration treatments (Stephenson 1996). Coupled with planting of giant sequoia seedlings (Stephens et al. 1999), mechanical harvest can be effective at enhancing giant sequoia regeneration by providing increased light availability in closed canopy forests (York et al. 2004). However, mechanical methods do not reproduce many of the ecological effects of fire, most notably increased structural heterogeneity, nutrient cycling, bare mineral soil substrates, and augmented seed germination from serotinous cones (Harvey et al. 1980, Stohlgren 1993).|$|R
30|$|Our {{study results}} have several {{implications}} for the management and restoration of giant sequoia groves. First, use of wildland fire (i. e., wildfire or prescribed fire) to enhance giant sequoia recruitment must be of sufficient intensity and resultant severity to create canopy gaps, increase understory light, and remove surface litter. Low-severity fire, while beneficial for other reasons (e.g., surface and ladder fuel reduction, nutrient cycling), may not adequately facilitate natural giant sequoia regeneration or canopy gap creation. Second, intensive <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> (e.g., shelterwood and seed tree harvest, clearcutting) followed by burning and possibly giant sequoia planting as observed in this study does increase giant sequoia regeneration. However, these benefits likely vary with the size and frequency of created canopy gaps, density of vegetation surrounding the gaps, and availability of solar radiation and soil moisture within gaps (York et al. 2003, 2011). Additionally, the benefits of intensive <b>retention</b> <b>harvest</b> or high-severity fire for giant sequoia regeneration are offset by potential negative impacts to resting and nesting habitat for late-seral dependent wildlife species in the southern Sierra Nevada, such as the Pacific fisher (Martes pennanti) (Spencer et al. 2008) and California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) (Roberts et al. 2011). A more prudent strategy is to apply a flexible ecosystem management approach that balances multiple ecological objectives (Piirto and Rogers 2002, North et al. 2010). For example, enhancing regeneration of giant sequoias and other fire-resilient species (e.g., pines, oaks) while minimizing impacts to sensitive wildlife habitat can be accomplished using a strategy {{that focuses on the}} promotion of small-size (< 0.4 ha) gap creation, stand heterogeneity, resiliency to fire and drought, and key habitat structures such as large-diameter trees and snags (North et al. 2010). At the landscape scale, this strategy can be accomplished via prudent combinations of wildland fire, strategic forest thinning, and prescribed fire. This and other adaptive and integrated strategies will be critical for the management of sequoia groves in an era of amplified wildfire activity (Westerling et al. 2006), increasing fire severity (Miller et al. 2009), and rapidly changing climate (Stephens et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|China’s {{growing economy}} {{and changes in}} {{policies}} that encourage afforestation, particularly in the industrial sector, have led vast areas in south China to be planted with eucalyptus. These large areas of eucalyptus plantings have elicited environmental concerns for two primary reasons. First there is a concern related to the water demand of eucalyptus, {{in which it is}} feared these large areas of eucalyptus will deplete aquifers and create shortages in water supplies. The second con-cern is in regard to the reduction in biodiversity across large landscapes, leading to further eco-logical demises. This paper proposes two ideas to possibly mitigate some of the biodiversity con-cerns. The first is the interplanting of alder-leaf birch (Betula alnoides), a native but dwindling species in south China, to enhance biodiversity and encourage it’s reestablishment across the landscape. The second is to encourage <b>retention</b> <b>harvests</b> of alder-leaf birch planted within euca-lyptus plantations to enhance not only biological diversity but also structural diversity across the landscape. Alder-leaf birch has demonstrated great potential in producing high quality timber and wood for use in furniture manufacturing...|$|R
30|$|We outline {{some of the}} {{challenges}} in, and new perspectives derived from, implementing and maintaining our experiment. This included difficulties protecting islands from high-intensity post-harvest regeneration burns and threat of declining funding undermining ongoing project viability. A critically important perspective concerns the ecological and economic context in which variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> is implemented. In the particular case of Mountain Ash forests, assessments using formal IUCN criteria classify the ecosystem as being Critically Endangered under the Red Listed Ecosystem approach. As a result, Mountain Ash forests are at {{a high risk of}} ecosystem collapse. Further logging will increase that risk, making the basis for continued harvesting questionable. In addition, economic analyses suggest that the value of natural assets, like water production, far outweigh the value of the wood products harvested from the Mountain Ash ecosystem, again leading to questions about the viability of ongoing harvesting. We therefore conclude that whilst variable <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> has the potential to contribute to biodiversity conservation in Mountain Ash forests, broader ecological and economic contextual issues (such as the values of competing resources like water yields and the heavily degraded state of the forest) may erode the case for its broader application.|$|E
30|$|Our {{variable}} <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> {{experiment was}} established in the Mountain Ash forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria which is a 60 [*]km[*]×[*] 80 [*]km region northeast of the city of Melbourne. These are spectacular temperate eucalypt-dominated forests which can approach 100 [*]m in top height (Ashton 1975). These forests are characterized by cool, wet climatic conditions (Lindenmayer et al. 1996) and occur in some of the wettest environments in Victoria with some places receiving more than 2500 [*]mm of rain annually.|$|E
40|$|Restoration based forest {{management}} has increased significantly {{over the last}} decade across North America. <b>Retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> shows promise for restoring and maintaining forest structural and compositional diversity and also increasing resilience and adaptive capacity. This includes deliberate retention of large living trees, snags and downed woody debris (DWD). However, lack of consistent monitoring limits our understanding of the effectiveness of these strategies and our ability to adapt management accordingly. We investigate the use of readily available Landsat sensor data to remotely estimate and map DWD and basal area (BA) following <b>retention</b> <b>harvesting</b> in northeastern Minnesota, USA. We used multi-temporal winter Landsat throughout a single season to calibrate models for DWD (R²: 0. 54, RMSE = 19. 02 m 3 ha- 1), total BA (R²: 0. 55, RMSE = 1. 85 m 2 ha- 1), hardwood BA (R²: 0. 67 RMSE = 1. 23 m 2 ha- 1), and conifer BA (R²: 0. 52 m 2 ha- 1, RMSE = 0. 94 m 2 ha- 1). This novel approach uses winter imagery with varying snow accumulation to estimate and map residual forest structures. In addition to practical treatment monitoring, this research provides a valuable tracking tool from which we may deepen our long-term understanding of wildlife responses to DWD, fire and carbon dynamics, and forest nutrient cycling...|$|E
40|$|Impacts of site {{management}} practices on {{the productivity of}} Eucalyptus tereticornis and E. grandis in industrial plantations have been investigated at four forest sites in Kerala State, southwest India. Management practices studied were: (1) harvest residue management; (2) nutrient additions; (3) weed control; and (4) legume cover cropping. Significant removal of nutrients from eucalypt plantations occurs through harvest of wood and removal of other aboveground biomass. Conservation of nutrients on site through <b>retention</b> of <b>harvest</b> residues and/or nutrient addition {{will be required to}} ensure sustained productivity. <b>Retention</b> of <b>harvest</b> residues had no effect on soil total C, N and P at 2 years after establishment. Tree growth did not respond to residue management or legume cover cropping at any of the sites at 4 years, but was significantly enhanced at 2 sites by N application, and at 1 site by P application. Weed control resulted in productivity increases at the E. tereticornis sites. There is a major opportunity for improving productivity of eucalypt plantations in Kerala through adoption of intensive management practices...|$|R
