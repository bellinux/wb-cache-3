5|$|In that article, he {{attempted}} to show how mental representations, specifically sentences {{in the language of}} thought, are necessary to explain this <b>relational</b> nature of mental states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the <b>relational</b> character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages and the Fregean view that they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E
5|$|Nahuatl {{does not}} have {{grammatical}} case but uses what is sometimes called a <b>relational</b> noun to describe spatial (and other) relations. These morphemes cannot appear alone but must occur after a noun or a possessive prefix. They are also often called postpositions or locative suffixes. In some ways these locative constructions resemble and {{can be thought of}} as locative case constructions. Most modern dialects have incorporated prepositions from Spanish that are competing with or that have completely replaced <b>relational</b> nouns.|$|E
5|$|Another set (set B) {{is used to}} {{indicate}} the person of subjects of transitive verbs (and in some languages, such as Yucatec, also the subjects of intransitive verbs, {{but only in the}} incompletive aspects), and also the possessors of nouns (including <b>relational</b> nouns).|$|E
5|$|Catholics {{who have}} {{committed}} to religious or consecrated life instead of marriage or single celibacy, as a state of life or <b>relational</b> vocation, include 54,559 male religious, 705,529 women religious. These are not ordained, nor generally considered ministers unless also engaged {{in one of the}} lay minister categories above.|$|E
25|$|In summary, {{the mental}} working models that {{underlie}} attachment styles appear to contain information about self {{and information about}} others organized into <b>relational</b> schemas. The <b>relational</b> schemas are themselves organized into a three-tier hierarchy. The highest level of the hierarchy contains <b>relational</b> schemas for a general working model that applies to all relationships. The middle level of the hierarchy contains <b>relational</b> schemas for working models that apply to different types of relationships (e.g., friends, parents, lovers). The lowest level of the hierarchy contains <b>relational</b> schemas for working models of specific relationships.|$|E
25|$|In {{database}} theory, structures with no {{functions are}} studied {{as models for}} <b>relational</b> databases, {{in the form of}} <b>relational</b> models.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} is in database theory, where a <b>relational</b> {{model of a}} database {{is essentially the same}} thing as a <b>relational</b> structure. It turns out that a conjunctive query on a database can be described by another structure in the same signature as the database model. A homomorphism from the <b>relational</b> model to the structure representing the query is the same thing as a solution to the query. This shows that the conjunctive query problem is also equivalent to the homomorphism problem.|$|E
25|$|Rank or the <b>Relational</b> Hierarchy.|$|E
25|$|The {{highest level}} of the {{hierarchy}} contains very general <b>relational</b> schemas that apply to all relationships. The next level of the hierarchy contains <b>relational</b> schemas that apply to particular kinds of relationships. The lowest level of the hierarchy contains relationship schemas that apply to specific relationships.|$|E
25|$|Bullying {{has been}} {{identified}} as being particularly prevalent in the nursing profession although the reasons are not clear. It is thought that <b>relational</b> aggression (psychological aspects of bullying such as gossiping and intimidation) are relevant. <b>Relational</b> aggression has been studied amongst girls but not so much amongst adult women.|$|E

25|$|<b>Relational</b> {{aggression}}, {{also known}} as covert aggression or covert bullying {{is a type of}} aggression in which harm is caused through damage to relationships or social status within a group rather than physical violence. <b>Relational</b> aggression is more common and has been studied more among girls than boys.|$|E

25|$|In a 2008 study {{alexithymia}} {{was found}} to be correlated with impaired understanding and demonstration of <b>relational</b> affection, and that this impairment contributes to poorer mental health, poorer <b>relational</b> well-being, and lowered relationship quality. Individuals high on the alexithymia spectrum also report less distress at seeing others in pain and behave less altruistically toward others.|$|E
25|$|In case of {{discontinuation}} {{of fertility}} treatment, {{the most common}} reasons have been estimated to be: postponement of treatment (39%), physical and psychological burden (19%, psychological burden 14%, physical burden 6.32%), <b>relational</b> and personal problems (17%, personal reasons 9%, <b>relational</b> problems 9%), treatment rejection (13%) and organizational (12%) and clinic (8%) problems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Relational</b> and {{equality}} atoms are also called first order atoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Relational</b> logic gained applications. In mathematics, it {{influenced}} the abstract analysis of E. H. Moore and the lattice theory of Garrett Birkhoff. In computer science, the <b>relational</b> model for databases was developed with Peircean ideas in work of Edgar F. Codd, {{who was a}} doctoral student of Arthur W. Burks, a Peirce scholar. In economics, <b>relational</b> logic was used by Frank P. Ramsey, John von Neumann, and Paul Samuelson to study preferences and utility and by Kenneth J. Arrow in Social Choice and Individual Values, following Arrow's association with Tarski at City College of New York.|$|E

25|$|Alex Comfort {{and others}} propose three {{potential}} social aspects {{of sexual intercourse}} in humans, which are not mutually exclusive: reproductive, <b>relational,</b> and recreational. The development of the contraceptive pill and other highly effective forms of contraception in the mid- and late 20th century has increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, which still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational) and also {{as a means of}} emotional intimacy (<b>relational),</b> thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (<b>relational),</b> and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and <b>relational).</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Relational</b> constructivism can be {{perceived}} as a <b>relational</b> consequence of the radical constructivism. In contrary to social constructivism, it picks up the epistemological threads and maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception (i.e. self referentially operating cognition). Therefore, humans are not able to come to objective conclusions about the world.|$|E

25|$|A {{collection}} of RDF statements intrinsically represents a labeled, directed multi-graph. This in theory makes an RDF data model {{better suited to}} certain kinds of knowledge representation than are other <b>relational</b> or ontological models. However, in practice, RDF data is often stored in <b>relational</b> database or native representations (also called Triplestores—or Quad stores, if context such as the named graph is also stored for each RDF triple).|$|E
25|$|The {{potency of}} the {{personal}} self and <b>relational</b> ties distinguish identity fusion from other forms of alignment with groups, such as “group identification”. In group identification, allegiance to the collective eclipses the personal self and <b>relational</b> ties to other group members. Because of this, the personal self and <b>relational</b> ties are not as involved in theories of group identification. Identity fusion theorizes that fusion measures should be more predictive of extreme pro-group behavior than previously proposed measures of identification. In fact, there is growing evidence of this. Measures of identity fusion are particularly powerful predictors of personally costly pro-group behaviors, including endorsement of extreme behaviors, such as fighting and dying for the group.|$|E
25|$|There are two ‘prepositions’: ní ‘on, at, in’ and sí ‘onto, towards’. The former {{indicates}} {{location and}} absence of movement, {{and the latter}} encodes location/direction with movement. Position and direction are expressed by the prepositions in combination with spatial <b>relational</b> nouns like orí ‘top’, apá ‘side’, inú ‘inside’, etí ‘edge’, abẹ́ ‘under’, ilẹ̀ ‘down’, etc. Many of the spatial <b>relational</b> terms are historically related to body-part terms.|$|E

25|$|In short, {{identity}} fusion theory {{posits that}} fused people project feelings of <b>relational</b> ties {{they have with}} known group members onto unknown group members. The projection of <b>relational</b> ties explains why fused individuals are sometimes willing to make sacrifices for members of large heterogeneous groups {{that most people would}} make only for small, tight-knit groups. Through the process of projection, they psychologically transform genetically unrelated individuals into kin.|$|E

25|$|The main {{elements}} of Macneil's <b>relational</b> contract theory {{were developed in}} a series of publications from 1969 to 1980, some of which are outlined below. He continued to publish articles and participate in colloquia in this field after 1980; however, the publications discussed below represent the key, formative literature of Macneil's version of <b>relational</b> theory. Subsequent publications have been mainly explanatory of the work done throughout the 1970s.|$|E
