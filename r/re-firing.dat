The 19th-place finish left Buescher with an outside chance at best for the championship finale at Homestead. There, despite scoring another pole, great runs by Dillon and Sauter and a run-in with Kevin Harvick solidified Buescher's third-place finish in the final point standings.|$|E
5000|$|Decoration applied {{under the}} glaze on pottery is {{generally}} {{referred to as}} underglaze.

40|$|To ensure equal {{replication}} {{of the genome}} in every eukaryotic cell cycle, replication origins fire only once each S phase and do not fire after passive replication. Failure in these controls can lead to local amplification, contributing to genome instability {{and the development of}} cancer. To identify features of replication origins important for such amplification, we have investigated origin firing and local genome amplification in the presence of excess helicase loaders Cdc 18 and Cdt 1 in fission yeast. We find that S phase controls are attenuated and coordination of origin firing is lost, resulting in local amplification. Specific origins are necessary for amplification but act only within a permissive chromosomal context. Origins associated with amplification are highly AT-rich, fire efficiently and early during mitotic S phase, and are located in large intergenic regions. We propose that these features predispose replication origins to <b>re-fire</b> within a single S phase, or to remain active after passive replication...|$|R

50|$|Pottery survives well {{in nearly}} all environments. It {{provides}} dating evidence and {{is also used to}} make inferences about exchange, economy and social dynamics. The Munsell color system is used to categorize colors of shards, while other aspects such as grain size and hardness are examined using other charts. Information on the process of manufacturing can also be rendered from pottery. Petrology studies characteristics of rocks, which are often used as temper in different forms of pottery. By studying temper in more detail, pottery can be sourced to specific manufacturers or geographic locations. Petrology can also inform studies of manufacturing techniques. Petrological techniques can be applied to pottery and bricks. However, 'fingerprinting' clay sources is much more difficult with certain artifact types with more ambiguous origins than others. <b>Re-firing</b> experiments and ethnology can also provide clues to fabric color and hardness, which inform understandings of manufacturing techniques.|$|E

40|$|Eight paleo-fired {{samples from}} the baked layer in {{different}} depths under the lava and one unfired sample were collected from Datong, China. Fine quartz grains (4 – 11 μm) from samples were used for probing into relationship between luminescence signals and paleo-firing temperatures. Findings from the <b>re-firing</b> experiments indicated that using thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) sensitivity changes could estimate the paleo-firing temperatures of samples: (1) 110 °C TL sensitivity change rate against the <b>re-firing</b> temperature can tell whether the sample has been fired to temperatures above 500 °C or not; (2) 150 °C TL sensitivity against the <b>re-firing</b> temperature can indicate whether the sample has been fired to temperatures above 900 °C or not; (3) the more specific paleo-firing temperatures can be estimated by comparing the ratio of OSL and 150 °C TL sensitivities against <b>re-firing</b> temperatures. Results showed that the paleo-firing temperatures of the eight lava-baked samples decreased exponentially with {{the distance from the}} lava.

5000|$|An aquastat is {{a device}} used in {{hydronic}} heating systems for controlling water temperature. To prevent the boiler from firing too often, aquastats {{have a high}} limit temperature and a low limit. If the thermostat is calling for heat, the boiler will fire until the high limit is reached, then shut off (even if the thermostat is still calling for heat). The boiler will <b>re-fire</b> if the boiler water temperature drops below a range around the high limit. The high limit exists {{for the sake of}} efficiency and safety. The boiler will also fire (regardless of thermostat state) when the boiler water temperature goes below a range around the low limit, ensuring that the boiler water temperature remains above a certain point. The low limit is intended for tankless domestic hot water---it ensures that boiler water is always warm enough to heat the domestic hot water. Many aquastats also have a differential ("diff") control which determines the size of the range around the [...] "low" [...] and/or [...] "high" [...] controls.|$|R
40|$|As we {{went through}} the program, what we determined, and what we all agreed on, was that the thrust {{coefficient}} (Cf) of the nozzle, after you get past a certain point, is really an engineering parameter. It s not a fundamental parameter {{that is going to be}} highly variable. Once we knew what the contour of the nozzle was, and once we knew what its characteristic was out to 2 : 1, we could calculate what the 48 : 1 thrust coefficient was going to be. In every case that we made a test, the calculation was precise. We weren't looking for a problem out at 48 : 1. Once we crushed the nozzle and said, "Yeah, we can land on the boulder," and once we had the thermal profile of that columbium nozzle, we did not require a lot of effort there. The real characterization was done in throttling over the 10 : 1 with the injector and controlling the mixture ratio on that - the whole head-end assembly - out to 2 : 1. I think everybody at NASA and Grumman agreed that flying like you test is great, particularly if you are using an aircraft engine. But, in this case, the thrust coefficient of the nozzle was not an issue. We had the tandem configuration of the service module, the command module, and the LEM sitting out there, and we were to fire the LEM. On Apollo 5, we were firing the LEM to show how it would work. There was a problem. I can t remember where the problem was, but something caused a problem before that engine had finished its burn. It was not in the engine, but there was some other problem, and NASA made a controlled shutdown. Then, they came to us and asked, "Hey, we re up there. We want to finish this test program. Is it okay if we restart that engine again in space with this tandem configuration?" We said, "As long as it has been more than forty minutes since you shut down, our analysis says that you will be okay in terms of the thermal characteristics of the inside of that chamber. " They restarted it and pushed that system around in orbit on Apollo 5. It turned out, that when it came to Apollo 13, we went back into the record, and said, "Hey, we have pushed this system around up there on Apollo 5, and we have also restarted this tandem configuration. " The requirements on Apollo 13 were to put it back into play. The spacecraft was out of free return to the earth at the time of the accident. It would not have come back. NASA said, "Okay, we ll use the descent engine to put the spacecraft in a free trajectory; it will go around the moon and be on free trajectory back to Earth. " Then, as it came around the far side of the moon, the guys found out that they had an oxygen problem. As you remember, things were getting pretty bad in there. They said, "We ve got to get it back as fast as we can. Is it okay if we <b>re-fire</b> the engine? Now, we re in a free trajectory, so we want to put as much delta-v (or change in velocity) in as we can. Can we <b>re-fire</b> right now?" We said, "Yes, the data says it has been this period of time. " We could <b>re-fire</b> the engine, run the rest of the duty cycle up as far as we needed while preserving enough fluids to make the final correction as the spacecraft got near Earth, and restart the engine. It was pretty fortuitous that we could give them those answers...|$|R
5000|$|This is {{a modern}} version of the earlier [...] "time on target" [...] concept in which fire from {{different}} weapons was timed to arrive on target at the same time. It is possible for artillery to fire several shells per gun at a target and have all of them arrive simultaneously, which is called MRSI (Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact). This is because {{there is more than}} one trajectory for the rounds to fly to any given target: typically one is below 45 degrees from horizontal and the other is above it, and by using different size propelling charges with each shell, it is possible to create multiple trajectories. Because the higher trajectories cause the shells to arc higher into the air, they take longer to reach the target and so if the shells are fired on these trajectories for the first volleys (starting with the shell with the most propellant and working down) and then after the correct pause more volleys are fired on the lower trajectories, the shells will all arrive at the same time. This is useful because many more shells can land on the target with no warning. With traditional volleys along the same trajectory, anybody at the target area may have time (however long it takes to reload and <b>re-fire</b> the guns) to take cover between volleys. However, guns capable of burst fire can deliver several rounds in 10 seconds if they use the same firing data for each, and if guns in more than one location are firing on one target they can use Time on Target procedures so that all their shells arrive at the same time and target.|$|R

40|$|A Buffalo curd {{packed in}} a clay pot {{is one of}} the most {{traditional}} dairy products in Sri Lanka. Although both clay pots and plastic cups are used for packaging of curd, the clay pot is the most popular package. However, the clay pot is disposable and become a waste after a use. This unsustainable consumption of limited clay resource is not environment friendly and cost effective. Re-using clay pots after <b>re-firing</b> will protect the earth while enhancing profit to the curd producer. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of <b>re-firing</b> of used curd packing clay pots on physical & microbiological qualities, quality of curd and analyze the possible energy saving. A Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used for the experiment with four treatments and eight replicates. The treatments are; <b>Re-firing</b> of used pots only once, twice, thrice and the control (new pots). Pots were re-fired at 800 0 C for one hour using a muffle furnace. Then the physical properties: weight, colour and compressive strength were measured. The initial microbial loads were tested by plate counts. Mold growth on curd was visually observed and pH was also measured to evaluate the shelf life of curd. According to the results, <b>re-firing</b> improved the red colour while reducing initial microbial counts. There was no effect on compressive strength and pot weight. The porosity of pots increased with <b>re-firing.</b> This led to excessive water loss resulting pH reduction of curd after third firing. Mold growth on curd was not observed for 12 days. Therefore, pots can be re-used at least twice after proper <b>re-firing</b> and there by 34 % of total energy and 2 / 3 rd of clay resources can be saved in the curd industry...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In Belém, Brazil, {{during the}} 19 th century, Portuguese tiles {{were used for}} the {{external}} facing of sepultures at the Soledade Cemetery. These pieces are fragile because of exposure to the tropical climate and of their location close to the ground. This research aims to obtain subsidies for the restoration of the glazed layer, through hot restoration, to serve as theoretical and technological references for future restoration projects. The samples consisted of fragments of Portuguese historical tiles from the Soledade Cemetery. Restoration was performed by cleaning (both mechanical and chemical ways) and <b>re-firing</b> (1000 ºC). Before and after the <b>re-firing,</b> samples were submitted to the analytical technique of X-ray diffraction. The results indicate that the <b>re-firing</b> eliminated defects and pathologies existent in the glaze and caused changes in the mineralogical composition of the ceramics. Used carefully, the hot technique is one of the alternatives to improve durability and protect the Soledade historical tiles...|$|E

30|$|The {{synaptic}} connections {{investigated in}} this model were purely excitatory. This not only simplifies the model for analytical investigations but is also of interest from a neurological perspective in terms of early brain development. Before birth, GABA {{is thought to have}} a depolarising effect on postsynaptic neurons and it is not until the nervous system reaches a more mature state that this neurotransmitter becomes inhibitory [53, 54]. While presynaptic inhibition is thought to be present at all developmental stages [55] this effect can be considered {{to be taken into account}} in the model by the fact that neurons cannot <b>re-fire</b> until they have returned to the quiescent state (i.e. inhibition in the model relates to the rate α at which neurons return to the quiescent state). We have recently shown that EEG recordings from very preterm infants (when GABA is still thought to be purely excitatory) exhibit LRTCs in the temporal occurrence of bursts of activity [35]. The model studied here may be a candidate mechanism for the generation of this temporal patterning in the discontinuous activity of the developing brain. Moreover, it is interesting to note that despite the fact that the system has purely excitatory postsynaptic connections and input, for these parameter regions, the model does not exhibit runaway excitation (saturation) but is able to maintain stable dynamics through the ‘balance’ of individual neuronal dynamics resulting from a trade-off between the rates at which neurons become active and quiescent. Indeed, while a number of authors have suggested that a balance of excitation and inhibition in neuronal networks leads to critical behaviour [56], the work here and in the companion paper shows that excitatory networks (i.e. networks without inhibitory neurons) can display the same behaviour. It can be speculated that this type of balanced activity in the region of a critical regime might be a way in which the brain avoids (for the most part) epileptic behaviour during early development, although it can also be argued that the decay rate contributes to a “balance condition” between excitation and inhibition [37].|$|R

40|$|Cdc 18 /Cdc 6 and Cdt 1 are {{essential}} initiation factors for DNA replication. In this paper {{we show that}} expression of Cdc 18 in fission yeast G 2 cells is sufficient to override the controls that ensure one S phase per cell cycle. Cdc 18 expression in G 2 induces DNA synthesis by <b>re-firing</b> replication origins and recruiting the MCM Cdc 21 to chromatin {{in the presence of}} low levels of Cdt 1. However, when Cdt 1 is expressed together with Cdc 18 in G 2, cells undergo very rapid, uncontrolled DNA synthesis, accumulating DNA contents of 64 C or more. Our data suggest that Cdt 1 may potentiate re-replication by inducing origins to fire more persistently, possibly by stabilizing Cdc 18 on chromatin. In addition, low level expression of a mutant form of Cdc 18 that cannot be phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases is not sufficient to induce replication in G 2, but does so only when co-expressed with Cdt 1. Thus, regulation of both Cdc 18 and Cdt 1 in G 2 plays a crucial role in preventing the re-initiation of DNA synthesis until the next cell cycle...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the firing temperature of a prehistoric pottery sample collected from ancient Mesopotamia, Turkey was studied using luminescence techniques.

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on Saadian {{ceramics}} called zellige from the archaeological sites of "El Badi palace" and "Saadian Tombs" (Marrakech, Morocco) dated in late 16 th Century and classified as world heritage by UNESCO in 2008. A multi-analytical approach based on optical microscopy, cathodoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction investigations and <b>re-firing</b> tests on ceramic supports has been used,in order to determineraw materials source, technical manufacturing and firing temperatures used by the Saadian artisans. Production technology, microstructure and the chemical compositionsuggest that the zellige pieces used {{in the construction of}} Saadian monuments in Marrakech are either imported from Fez, i. e. the main center of production of the zellige in Morocco, or manufactured locally in Marrakech according to the current standards and procedures in Fez. The calcareous clay raw materialwas used to manufacture these ceramics, but firing temperature was different. Zellige of El Badi palace was fired at a maximum temperature of 700 °C in oxidizing atmosphere, while the one of Saadian Tombs was fired in the range 900 - 950 °C. The low firing temperature for Zellige facilitates the pieces cutting but it is responsible for the poor quality of these materials due to the absence of the vitreous phases. The results provide a scientific support for decision making in future conservation and restoration strategies of historical monumentsacross Morocco. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|New ceramic {{pigments}} {{based on}} the tialite (Al 2 TiO 5) structure, doped with Co (pink), Cr (green) or Mn (brown), were prepared through pyrolysis of aerosols followed by calcination of the obtained powders at 1400 ?C. The expected decomposition of Al 2 TiO 5 into a mixture of Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 on <b>re-firing</b> was inhibited by Cr-doping and also by co-doping with Mg the Mn or Co doped samples. Microstructure and phase evolution during pigment preparation were monitored by SEM and XRPD. Unit cell parameters of tialite were determined by Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns revealing in all cases the formation of solid solutions where the solubility of dopants in the Al 2 TiO 5 lattice followed the trend: Co < Mn < Cr. Valence state and possible location of dopants in the tialite lattice were investigated by XPS and DRS spectroscopies, which suggested the presence of Cr 3 + ions in a large interstitial site of the tialite lattice with distorted octahedral geometry, and of Mn 3 + and Co 2 + ions at the Al 3 + octahedral sites of the tialite lattice in the former case, and in both Al 3 + and Ti 4 + octahedral sites, in the latter. Technological behaviour of pigments was assessed by testing in ceramic glazes finding that the color stability was reasonably good for the Mn-doped tialite and the Cr-doped pigment although the latter suffered a small loss of green hue, while the Co-doped pigment was not stable in glazes, undergoing a cobalt-leaching effect...|$|E
