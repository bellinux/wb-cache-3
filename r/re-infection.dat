25|$|While annual or semi-annual mass antihelminthic {{administration}} {{is a critical}} aspect of any public health intervention, many have begun to realize how unsustainable it is due to aspects such as poverty, high rates of <b>re-infection,</b> and diminished efficacy of drugs with repeated use. Current research, therefore, {{has focused on the}} development of a vaccine that could be integrated into existing control programs. The goal of vaccine development is not necessarily to create a vaccine with sterilizing immunity or complete protection against immunity. A vaccine that reduces the likelihood of vaccinated individuals developing severe infections and thus reduced blood and nutrient levels could still {{have a significant impact on}} the high burden of disease throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Mechanisms of {{resistance}} {{have been studied}} by several authors in different animal species. These studies may help {{to better understand the}} immune response to F. hepatica in host and are necessary in development of vaccine against the parasite. It has been established that cattle acquire resistance to challenge infection with F. hepatica and F. gigantica when they have been sensitized with primary patent or drug-abbreviated infection. Resistance to fasciolosis was also documented in rats. On the other hand, sheep and goats are not resistant to <b>re-infection</b> with F. hepatica. However, there is evidence that two sheep breeds, in particular Indonesian thin tail sheep and Red maasai sheep, are resistant to F. gigantica. No reports concerning the resistance in humans are available.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Investigation {{of chronic}} infections with Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Methods: BALB/c mice were {{repeatedly}} infected with C. pneumoniae and tested during a 1 -year period. Production of histamine, IFN-γ, IL- 6 and antibodies was monitored by ELISA. Live bacteria were cultured and DNA {{was detected by}} PCR. Cellular immunity was tested by ELISPOT. Results: After <b>re-infections,</b> culture positivity and persistence of DNA in lungs and blood were shorter. Detection of DNA at late time points indicated persistent infection in a few mice. Histamine was produced after primary and <b>re-infections,</b> and the level correlated {{with the number of}} viable bacteria in lung. IFN-γ, IL- 6 levels, IgG 2 /IgG 1 ratio, IgA titres, and level of chlamydial heat-shock protein antibodies were higher after <b>re-infections.</b> IgM antibodies were demonstrated even after <b>re-infections.</b> High number of IFN-γ-producing splenocytes was observed after the third inoculation.

30|$|The {{limitation}} of this study is the lack of a control group and relatively medium term follow up. Although there were no deep <b>re-infections</b> in these patients at the last follow up, it may still be early to comment on the long term outcome of the implants.|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of treatment is improving denture hygiene, i.e. removing the denture at night, cleaning and disinfecting it, and storing it overnight in an antiseptic solution. This is important as the denture is usually infected with C. albicans which will cause <b>re-infection</b> if it is not removed. Substances which are used include solutions of alkaline peroxides, alkaline hypochlorites (e.g. hypochlorite, which may over time corrode metal components of dental appliances), acids (e.g. benzoic acid), yeast lytic enzymes and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. alcalase protease). The other aspect of treatment involves resolution of the mucosal infection, for which topical antifungal medications are used (e.g. nystatin, amphotericin, miconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole). Often an antimicrobial mouthwash such as chlorhexidine is concurrently prescribed. Possible underlying disease (diabetes, HIV) should be treated where possible.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded artificial induction {{of immunity}} in humans was by variolation or inoculation, {{which is the}} controlled infection of a subject with a less lethal natural form of smallpox (known as Variola Minor) to make him or her immune to <b>re-infection</b> with the more lethal natural form, Variola Major. This was practiced in ancient times in China and India, and imported into Europe, via Turkey, around 1720 by Lady Montagu and perhaps others. [...] From England, the technique spread rapidly to the Colonies, and was also spread by African slaves arriving into Boston.|$|E
30|$|The {{main feature}} of malaria is to {{establish}} a long-run equilibrium with the host organism. After the initial stage of infection—during which, the risk of dying is higher—the individual suffers periodical febrile reactions, that last for three or four days (depending on the species of Plasmodium). After several <b>re-infections,</b> individuals can develop partial immunity (Doolan et al. 2009). Thus, malaria periodically stresses the immune system {{for a long period of}} time, which, according to the theory of inflammation, should result in faster aging.|$|R
50|$|Chimpanzees {{sometimes}} eat {{the leaves}} of the herbaceous Desmodium gangeticum. Undigested, non-chewed leaves were recovered in 4% of faecal samples of wild chimpanzees and clumps of sharp-edged grass leaves in 2%. The leaves have a rough surface or sharp-edges and the fact they were not chewed and excreted whole indicates they were not ingested for nutritional purposes. Furthermore, this leaf-swallowing was restricted to the rainy season when parasite <b>re-infections</b> are more common, and parasitic worms (Oesophagostomum stephanostomum) were found together with the leaves.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} ways to prevent a T. canis {{infection}} in both dogs and humans. Regular deworming by a veterinarian is important to stop canine <b>re-infections,</b> especially if the dog is frequently outdoors. Good practices to prevent human infections include: washing hands before eating and after disposing of animal feces in a timely manner as many disinfectants do not kill eggs, teaching children not to eat soil, and cooking meat to a safe temperature in order to kill potentially infectious eggs.|$|R
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{problems}} with serological testing: in highly endemic areas, not everyone who becomes infected will actually develop clinical disease or require treatment. Indeed, up to 32% of the healthy population may test positive, but not require treatment. [...] Conversely, because serological tests look for an immune response and not for the organism itself, the test does not become negative after the patient is cured, it cannot be used as a check for cure, or to check for <b>re-infection</b> or relapse. Likewise, patients with abnormal immune systems (e.g., HIV infection) will have false-negative tests.|$|E
2500|$|Inoculation in the East was {{historically}} {{performed by}} blowing smallpox crusts into the nostril. In Britain, Europe and the American Colonies the preferred method was rubbing material from a smallpox pustule from a selected mild case (Variola minor) into a scratch between the thumb and forefinger. [...] This would generally be performed {{when an individual}} was in normal good health, and thus at peak resistance. [...] The recipient would develop smallpox; however, due to being introduced through the skin rather than the lungs, and possibly because of the inoculated individual's preexisting state of good health, the small inoculum, and the single point of initial infection, the resulting case of smallpox was generally milder than the naturally occurring form, produced far less facial scarring, and had a far lower mortality rate. As with survivors of the natural disease, the inoculated individual was subsequently immune to <b>re-infection.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHuman rhinoviruses (HRVs) are an {{important}} cause of respiratory tract infections. ObjectivesWe questioned whether the high prevalence rates of HRVs found in epidemiological studies is due to long-term individual continuity or a result of frequent infections with different HRV subtypes. Study designIn a 6 -month winter period 18 healthy controls, aged 0 – 7 years, were at least sampled every two weeks for HRV-PCR, irrespective of respiratory symptoms. All HRV positive samples were genotyped to determine HRV diversity. ResultsIn total 272 samples were collected. HRV was found in 101 / 272 (37 %) samples. Genotyping revealed 27 different HRV subtypes. A median of 3. 0 different HRV subtypes was found per child. <b>Re-infections</b> and continuity with identical HRV sequences were observed. The number of HRVs {{were higher in the}} youngest age group (p= 0. 01) and they had more different HRV subtypes (p= 0. 05) compared to oldest age group. ConclusionsWe found a high HRV exposition with a considerable diverse population of HRV subtypes in young children. These results have major implications for future research into the pathogenic role of HRV in respiratory diseases. Characterisation of subtypes will be necessary to discriminate between prolonged continuity and <b>re-infections</b> in patients with respiratory diseases...|$|R

5|$|These {{laboratory}} tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute {{phase of the}} illness {{with the exception of}} serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types IgG and IgM, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following <b>re-infections.</b> IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent <b>re-infections,</b> levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis. The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.|$|R

A total of 268 children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were followed-up for 28 days according to WHO recommendations, with PCR genotyping to distinguish late recrudescences from <b>re-infections.</b> PCR-adjusted failure proportions at day 28 were 37. 0 % (34 / 92, 95 % CI 27. 1 - 47. 7) in the SP group, 20. 6 % (14 / 68, 95 % CI 11. 7 - 32. 1) in the AQ group and 22. 8 % (18 / 79, 95 % CI 14. 1 - 33. 6) in the CQ + SP group.

40|$|Recent evidences have {{demonstrated}} {{that the presence of}} low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) may {{play an important role in}} host ecology and transmission of avian influenza viruses (AIV). While some authors have clearly demonstrated that LPAIV can mutate to render highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV), others have shown that their presence could provide the host with enough immunological memory to resist <b>re-infections</b> with HPAIV. In order to experimentally study the role of pre-existing host immunity, chickens previously infected with H 7 N 2 LPAIV were subsequently challenged with H 7 N 1 HPAIV. Pre-infection of chickens with H 7 N 2 LAPIV conferred protection against the lethal challenge with H 7 N 1 HPAIV, dramatically reducing the viral shedding, the clinical signs and the pathological outcome. Correlating with the protection afforded, sera from chickens primed with H 7 N 2 LPAIV reacted with the H 7 -AIV subtype in hemagglutination inhibition assay and specifically with the N 2 -neuraminidase antigen. Conversely, subsequent exposure to H 5 N 1 HPAIV resulted in a two days-delay on the onset of disease but all chickens died by 7 days post-challenge. Lack of protection correlated with the absence of H 5 -hemagglutining inhibitory antibodies prior to H 5 N 1 HPAIV challenge.
