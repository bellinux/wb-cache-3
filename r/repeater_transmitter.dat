5000|$|The ARRL (American Radio Relay League) has {{specified}} that repeaters on the 33 centimeter band use a split of -12 MHz with inputs between 906 and 909 MHz and outputs between 918 and 921 MHz. However, {{the majority of}} amateur 33 centimeter band amateur repeaters use a split of -25 MHz with inputs between 902 and 903 MHz and outputs between 927 and 928 MHz. There are several reasons behind this. The primary reason being that most amateur repeaters in this band are built from commercial equipment that has been modified to transmit and receive in the amateur 33 centimeter band and modification complexity increases rapidly as target frequencies are moved further from the original design frequencies. A 25 MHz split results in frequencies fairly close to the original frequencies this commercial equipment was designed for resulting in relatively simple modifications. As well, spectrum analyzer tests consistently show the noise floor to be considerably higher {{near the center of}} the band due to other non-amateur services making the quieter frequencies near the band limits more desirable [...] Finally, the 12 MHz split requires high quality and more expensive duplexer devices to isolate the repeater receiver from the <b>repeater</b> <b>transmitter</b> when sharing a single antenna (as most repeaters do) whereas the 25 MHz split provides sufficient frequency separation such that separate antenna for transmit and receive with 20 feet or more of vertical separation often works well and eliminates the need for expensive duplexers as long as the <b>repeater</b> <b>transmitter</b> is limited to 15 to 20 watts of output power.|$|E

Channel 9 became a CBC owned-and-operated station on September 1, 1975, and changed its call letters to CBET. The station's schedule {{did not change}} much early on; it still featured the same formula of CBC and CTV programs, along with British and American television shows (mostly reruns and movies) with Detroit rights. CBET also carried some special programming aimed at American viewers, such as the annual Weekend With the Stars telethon for United Cerebral Palsy in the early 1980s. CTV content on CBET would remain at some capacity through the 1980s, {{despite the fact that}} after the CBC took full control of channel 9 in 1975, Kitchener-based CTV affiliate CKCO-TV signed on a <b>repeater</b> <b>transmitter</b> in Sarnia on channel 42, with a signal that reached Windsor at least marginally.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} get better receive {{coverage}} over a wide area, a similar linked setup can also be done with {{what is known as}} a voted receiver system. In a voted receiver, there are several satellite receivers set up to receive on the same frequency (the one that the users transmit on). All of the satellite receivers are linked to a voting selector panel that switches from receiver to receiver based on the best quieting (strongest) signal, and the output of the selector will actually trigger the central <b>repeater</b> <b>transmitter.</b> A properly adjusted voting system can switch many times a second and can actually [...] "assemble" [...] a multi-syllable word using a different satellite receiver for each syllable. Such a system can be used to widen coverage to low power mobile radios or handheld radios that otherwise {{would not be able to}} key up the central location, but can receive the signal from the central location without an issue. Voting systems require no knowledge or effort on the part of the user - the system just seems to have better-than-average handheld coverage.|$|E
50|$|On 14 July 1789 {{with the}} Storming of the Bastille came the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution, which would soon affect Germany. On 20 April 1792, France declared war on Austria. By 15 May 1793, the French were marching into Blieskastel, and on 27 July they burnt Karlsberg Castle near Homburg and began thrusting into the Glan valley, taking the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank over bit by bit for France. In 1794, when Prussian troops were in the Kusel area, the farmers from the Sickingen Heights drove their livestock before the French advance to Dietschweiler and Nanzweiler. On 26 July, Kusel was burnt down. On 5 April 1795 came the Peace of Basel, under whose terms Prussia recognized France’s annexation of the lands on the Rhine’s left bank. Two and a half years later, on 17 October 1797, Austria, too, agreed to this deed {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Campo Formio. A further agreement, the Treaty of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, made the cession of these lands to France permanent. The annexation to the French Republic also brought its attendant new territorial order. Merely by chance, the villages each side of the Glan that now make up Nanzdietschweiler remained asunder, for the river now formed the boundary between the Departments of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German) and Sarre. Dietschweiler and Nanzweiler on the left bank now belonged to the Mairie (“Mayoralty”) of Glan-Münchweiler, the Canton of Waldmohr, the Arrondissement of Saarbrücken and the Department of Sarre, while the centres that later became Nanzdiezweiler on the right bank found themselves in the Mairie of Obermohr (later Niedermohr), the Canton of Landstuhl, the Arrondissement of Zweibrücken and the Department of Donnersberg. In 1802, Nanzdietschweiler had 518 inhabitants (225 in Dietschweiler, 140 in Nanzweiler and 153 in Nanzdiezweiler). Napoleon’s fortunes in Germany were dealt a blow in October 1813 with his defeat at the Battle of Leipzig (also called the Battle of the Nations). Less than a year later, the French were driven out of the country and the Palatinate was no longer under French rule, a deed made ofﬁcial under the Treaty of Paris on 30 May 1814. By that time, the Congress of Vienna had already decided two days earlier that the Palatinate should be annexed to the Kingdom of Bavaria. After a transitional period, the Congress of Vienna established the Baierischer Rheinkreis, later known as the Rheinpfalz (Rhenish Palatinate), a newly formed exclave of the Kingdom of Bavaria. Even then, the centres either side of the Glan remained administratively split. Nanzdiezweiler, which now had its current name, belonged at ﬁrst to the Bürgermeisterei (“Mayoralty”) of Steinwenden, and then later to the Bürgermeisterei of Niedermohr in the Canton of Landstuhl, whereas the villages of Dietschweiler and Nanzweiler on the Glan’s left bank belonged to the Bürgermeisterei of Glan-Münchweiler in the Canton of Waldmohr and the Landkommissariat of Homburg. The cantons (Kantone) were later called districts (Distrikte), but lost their importance and were thus eventually dissolved. The Landkommissariate became Bezirksämter, and then Landkreise or “districts”. In 1824, there were 154 hearths (for which read “households”) in what is now Nanzdietschweiler, 53 in Nanzdiezweiler and in Dietschweiler and Nanzweiler 101 all together. That same year, a schoolhouse was built in Dietschweiler, as was another in Nanzweiler. Another one followed in 1868 in Nanzdiezweiler. In 1836/1837, Nanzdietschweiler had 853 inhabitants (287 in Dietschweiler, 222 in Nanzweiler and 344 in Nanzdiezweiler). The 20th century brough along with it the railway. The line from Glan-Münchweiler to Homburg was dedicated on 1 May 1904. It also brought a Catholic church, approval for which was received on 16 January 1908; it received blessing later that same year, on Christmas Eve, from Nanzweiler native Prof. Nikolaus Donauer. On 22 July 1928, a bell was consecrated at Heart of Jesus Catholic Church (Herz-Jesu-Kirche). On 17 January 1909, the Dietschweiler Protestant Church Building Association was founded. Administrative structures changed again after the First World War when the Treaty of Versailles stipulated, among other things, that Homburg had to be ceded to the British- and French-occupied Saar. The rest of the Homburg district that was then still within Weimar Germany now functioned as a branch of Waldmohr in the Kusel district, and was permanently grouped into the Kusel district in 1940. The Canton of Landstuhl was a branch of the Bezirksamt of Kaiserslautern, but had been fully merged into Kaiserslautern by 1938. In the early 1930s, the Nazi Party (NSDAP) became quite popular in Dietschweiler. In the 1930 Reichstag elections, only 5.5% of the local votes went to Adolf Hitler’s party, but by the 1932 Reichstag elections, this had grown to 40%. By the time of the 1933 Reichstag elections, after Hitler had already seized power, local support for the Nazis had swollen to 49.4%. This success, however, was not repeated in nearby Nanzweiler, where the respective ﬁgures were 2.4%, 19.9% and 18.75% with a hefty 75% majority there going to the Centre Party in 1933, which was also the runner-up in Dietschweiler (36.7%). Nevertheless, Hitler’s overall success in these elections paved the way for his Enabling Act of 1933 (Ermächtigungsgesetz), thus starting the Third Reich in earnest. On 19 March 1945, American troops - actually tanks - came into Nanzdietschweiler at about six o’clock in the evening that day. The Second World War ended, at least in Europe, on 7/8 May 1945. On 17 October 1954, forty-ﬁve years after the Protestant Church Building Association was founded, the Protestant church was consecrated. The ﬁrst spadeful of earth had been turned on 24 August 1952. The 1950s also brought infrastructure improvements. In 1955, the local electrical network in Nanzweiler was taken over by Pfalzwerke AG and subsequently modernized. In 1957, the water shortage in the Münchweiler valley was remedied by the Oberes Glantal (“Upper Glan Valley”) group supply facility. The pumping works were near Elschbach, and a supply pipeline ran as far as Rehweiler. The whole system was dedicated with a Wasserfest (“Water Festival”) on 25 August of that year at the Eicherwald water cistern. The festivities were, however, cut short - perhaps ironically - by a rainstorm. That same month, Dietschweiler’s ﬁrst watermain went into operation, putting the local washing brook out of business. On 9 August 1959, the warriors’ memorial in Nanzweiler was unveiled. A memorial to the fallen was also unveiled in Dietschweiler on 15 November 1964. Nanzdiezweiler’s warriors’ memorial was unveiled on 30 October 1966. Sewerage was laid in Nanzweiler in 1966. In 1968, a new bridge was built across the Glan near the old gristmill (the Dietschweiler Mühle). The old three-arch bridge, built in 1845 from sandstone blocks, was replaced with a concrete one. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1968, there was a fundamental change in the administrative structure for all the villages. Nanzdiezweiler was now also grouped into the Kusel district, and on 7 June 1969, the Ortsgemeinde of Nanzdietschweiler was formed out of the until then self-administering municipalities of Dietschweiler, Nanzdiezweiler and Nanzweiler. This deed was carried out under the Fourth Verwaltungsvereinfachungsgesetz (“Administration Simpliﬁcation Law”) of 10 January 1969. One year later, on 11 June 1970, Landrat (District Chairman) Held came to the municipality with an entourage of district administration consultants, department heads and the leader of the Kusel Health Ofﬁce to view the new municipality of Nanzdietschweiler. In 1968/1969, the municipality of Nanzdiezweiler began planning and publicity for a new building area, “Am Kreuzhübel”. Work began in March 1974, and workers began building the ﬁrst house on 15 November 1974. Also in 1968/1969, the Kreisstraße (District Road) between Nanzdiezweiler and Katzenbach was built. On 18 October 1970, a new peal of bells was consecrated at the Protestant church, and on this occasion, the church itself acquired a name, Saint Martin’s (Martinskirche). On 22 April 1972, the new Verbandsgemeinde of Glan-Münchweiler was formed, comprising 14 municipalities, among them Nanzdietschweiler. Arthur Höring was elected the ﬁrst Verbandsgemeindemeister on 4 October 1972 and then sworn in and inaugurated in ofﬁce on 3 November 1972. On 30 April 1972, the newly expanded Catholic church in Nanzweiler was consecrated. Work had begun in June 1969. In May 1973, the ﬁrm Edm. Corty & Co. GmbH, Krefeld - New York set up a women’s clothing branch plant at the former schoolhouse. The operation was closed on 31 March 1978 with the ﬁrm Dobierzin & Co. GmbH taking it over the next day (1 April 1978). Operations only continued, however, until 25 May 1979, when the plant was closed for good. In March 1976, the new television <b>repeater</b> <b>transmitter</b> on the Hühnerböshöhe went into operation. The total cost for the project, borne by Deutsche Bundespost, was 218,000 DM. On 14 September 1978, a new bridge across the Glan was opened to trafﬁc. The old bridge had been only a wooden footbridge between the two centres with a ford alongside for any vehicles. On 20 March 1980, municipal council adopted a resolution to introduce a municipal coat of arms. Approval to do so was received from the Rheinhessen-Pfalz Regierungsbezirk administration in Neustadt an der Weinstraße on 26 September of that year. Also in 1980, on the night of 16 August, a heavy storm raged over the southern part of the Kusel district, bringing heavy rainfalls and consequent serious flooding. Water on the Nanzdietschweiler sporting ground was so deep that boats could be used on it, and indeed, this was the only way to reach the clubhouse. On 31 May 1981, service on the railway line from Glan-Münchweiler to Homburg was ended. From 12 to 16 May 1983, the municipality had its 600-year jubilee of ﬁrst documentary mention, which was celebrated with a district local history day. Nobody knew at this time that there was an earlier documentary mention of the municipality. In 1985, Nanzdietschweiler forged a partnership with the Alsatian municipality of Bütten (German spelling) or Butten (French spelling). There were also plans for another new building area, “Auf der Höllenhub”. In 1989, a new sewage treatment plant was built. In 1996 a new fire brigade equipment house was built. On the occasion of the 625-year jubilee of ﬁrst documentary mention in December 2008, Mr. Roland Paul, head of the Institute for Palatine History and Folklore (Institut für pfälzische Geschichte und Volkskunde) reported that a document about Nanzdietschweiler from 1350 had been discovered in the Munich State Archive. Until this time, Nanzdietschweiler’s ﬁrst documentary mention had been thought to date from 1383, but this new discovery pushed the municipality’s written history back by 33 years.|$|E
