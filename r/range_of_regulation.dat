40|$|The conical {{tunnel burner}} is an {{improvement}} of the cylindrical tunnel burner because, by maintaining all its advantages by means of burning intensification, it may also insure the flame stabilization in a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> with considerable diminished pressure losses. Technical applications for the conical furnace burner can vary due to the limited dimensions required by the system, {{as well as the}} important thermal loads, and also because of the burning stability characteristic that spreads over an important <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulation.</b> The low costs required by the burner, generated mainly by its simple construction, also raise the interest for this technical solution. A physical model is proposed for the ignition and flame front stabilization. The flame front stabilization contains different steps from the ignition moment to final flame front stabilization, with specific flame front geometries and specific locations along the burner axis. The installation realised by the authors allowed the experimental study of the burning process in conical furnaces, {{in order to determine the}} temperature fields and the flame profiles. The physical model developed for this new type of application and the experimental data sets obtained (along with their interpretation) make the subject of this paper...|$|E

While EV recharging represents a considerable extra load on the grid, they also offer new opportunities in terms of consumption flexibility. In this paper, we use the recharging process of EVs to provide regulation to the grid by varying the instantaneous recharging power. We provide an economic analysis of the incentives at play, including the EV owners point of view (longer recharging durations and impact on battery lifetime versus cheaper energy) and the aggregator point of view (revenues from recharging versus regulation gains). In particular, we analyze the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> rewards such that offering a regulation-oriented recharging benefits both EV owners and the aggregator. Interestingly, we observe that under current market conditions in France, an aggregator could offer regulating EV owners to recharge for 50 % cheaper, and still be better off than offering only constant-power recharging...|$|E

Here, we present database rSNPBase, freely available at [URL] to provide curated rSNPs that analyses the regulatory features of all SNPs in the human genome with reference to experimentally supported regulatory elements. In contrast with previous SNP functional annotation databases, rSNPBase is characterized by several unique features. (i) To improve reliability, all SNPs in rSNPBase are annotated with reference to experimentally supported regulatory elements. (ii) rSNPBase focuses on rSNPs involved in a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> types, including proximal and distal transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional regulation, and identifies their potentially regulated genes. (iii) Linkage disequilibrium (LD) correlations between SNPs were analysed so that the regulatory feature is annotated to SNP-set rather than a single SNP. (iv) rSNPBase provides the spatio-temporal labels and experimental eQTL labels for SNPs. In summary, rSNPBase provides more reliable, comprehensive and user-friendly regulatory annotations on rSNPs and will assist researchers in selecting candidate SNPs for further genetic studies and in exploring causal SNPs for in-depth molecular mechanisms of complex phenotypes...|$|E

Separation of these particles in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes, monitored by /?-hexosaminidase, a lysosomal marker enzyme, {{was established by}} density gradient centrifugation. Percoll density gradients were modified and improved by adding free polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 0. 75 %) to 60 % Percoll, which {{made it possible to}} separate AVd (buoyant peak, d = 1. 090) and DB (dense peak, d = 1. 131) effectively. Addition of graded levels of a regulatory amino acid mixture (Reg AA) to hepatocyte incubation not only suppressed proteolysis, but also lead to a shift of vacuolar profiles on the density gradients from the buoyant to the dense region. Alterations in the vacuolar shift and proteolysis were highly proportional over a full <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> by Reg AA.

Tremendous genetic engineering approaches and tools {{have been and}} still are being developed for prokaryotes.

40|$|The tet {{regulatory}} {{system in which}} doxycycline (dox) acts as an inducer of specifically engineered RNA polymerase II promoters was transferred into transgenic mice. Tight control and a broad <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> spanning up to five orders of magnitude were monitored dependent on the dox concentration in the water supply of the animals. Administration of dox rapidly induces the synthesis of the indicator enzyme luciferase whose activity rises over several orders of magnitude within the first 4 h in some organs. Induction is complete after 24 h in most organs analyzed. A comparable regulatory potential was revealed with the tet {{regulatory system}} where dox prevents transcription activation. Directing the synthesis of the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) to the liver led to highly specific regulation in hepatocytes where, in presence of dox, less than one molecule of luciferase was detected per cell. By contrast, a more than 10 (5) -fold activation of the luciferase gene was observed {{in the absence of}} the antibiotic. This regulation was homogeneous throughout but stringently restricted to hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that both tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation systems provide genetic switches that permit the quantitative control of gene activities in transgenic mice in a tissue-specific manner and, thus, suggest possibilities for the generation of a novel type of conditional mutants...|$|E

The {{compaction}} of rod concrete mixes is a {{very complex}} process, envisaging a rapid increase of linear pressures, taking into account constant change in physical-mechanical properties of compacted material. Several hundred models of compacting equipment have been manufactured to date in the world; however, {{for a long period of}} time the models and types of rollers have been created and continue to be so, by the trial and error method, without accounting for the theoretical fundamentals of the process of compaction and specific features of mechanics of the force interaction of a operating element (drum, tire) with the material compacted. Contemporary directions of development of pavement equipment necessitate the creation of machines of the multipurpose use; designing the constructions, the working processes in which incorporate new technologies, ensuring the growing production yield and labor productivity; and careful treatment of economical and material resources.

40|$|The use of {{reporter}} gene fusions to assess cellular {{processes such as}} protein targeting and regulation of transcription or translation is established technology in archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryal genetics. Fluorescent proteins or enzymes resulting in chromogenic substrate turnover, like β -galactosidase, have been particularly useful for microscopic and screening purposes. However, application of such methodology is of limited use for strictly anaerobic organisms due to the requirement of molecular oxygen for chromophore formation or color development. We have developed β -lactamase from Escherichia coli (encoded by bla) {{in conjunction with the}} chromogenic substrate nitrocefin into a reporter system usable under anaerobic conditions for the methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans. By using a signal peptide of a putative flagellin from M. acetivorans and different catabolic promoters, we could demonstrate growth substrate-dependent secretion of β -lactamase, facilitating its use in colony screening on agar plates. Furthermore, a series of fusions comprised of a constitutive promoter and sequences encoding variants of the synthetic tetracycline-responsive riboswitch (tc-RS) was created to characterize its influence on translation initiation in M. acetivorans. One tc-RS variant resulted in more than 11 -fold tetracycline-dependent regulation of bla expression, which is in the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> by naturally occurring riboswitches.
