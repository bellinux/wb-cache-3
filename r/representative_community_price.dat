40|$|Food {{price policy}} {{relies heavily on}} {{estimated}} price elasticities of food demand to help balance the nutritional and economic objectives in poor countries. Economists use either unit values (ratios of household expenditure to quantity purchased) or <b>community</b> <b>prices</b> (enumerated from vendors in local markets) as proxies for market prices when estimating price elasticities with household survey data. Biases are believed to result from using unit values, due to measurement error and quality effects, but evidence on this issue is lacking and even less is known about <b>community</b> <b>prices.</b> This article provides an empirical evidence from Vietnam, which suggests that economists should exercise caution when estimating price elasticities from household surveys. A 14 -food demand system is estimated alternatively with unit values or <b>community</b> <b>prices,</b> and the elasticity of calories with respect to rice prices is calculated. This elasticity {{is more than twice}} as large (- 0. 54 versus - 0. 22) when <b>community</b> <b>prices</b> are used rather than unit values. Hence, conclusions about the nutritional effects of rice price increases appear sensitive to data choices made by economists. More generally, this discrepancy suggests that the household survey databases commonly used by economists may not provide reliable estimates. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the views of <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> {{participating}} in a large health service in Australia. Cross-sectional survey of 49 <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> and interviews with a purposeful sample of representatives (n = 10) and staff (n = 19). Most <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> had positive attitudes about their value and potential for influence, citing concrete examples of impact. Having an external network or group was related to their beliefs in their ability to add value to their health service. <b>Community</b> <b>representatives</b> largely agreed they provided a link to, and represented, the wider community although most thought staff did not understand their role or how to work with them. Some staff questioned representativeness of their <b>community</b> <b>representatives.</b> Improving <b>community</b> participation is argued to be important in delivering better healthcare services, but effective engagement and representation at the local level is often challenging. Focusing on <b>community</b> <b>representative</b> views takes us beyond debates around representativeness to identify practical strategies to improve practice. The authors recommend health services recruit consumers with strong links to networks in the community, provide a structured and supported program, and improve staff understanding of the range of possible roles for <b>community</b> <b>representatives.</b> Local examples of community representatives' impact on policy and practice should be widely communicated. In giving prominence to the views of consumers using triangulated methods, the authors found most could report with clarity what their role was and how they impacted at their local health service. 17 page(s...|$|R
