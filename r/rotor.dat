5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main <b>rotor.</b> The <b>rotor</b> blades {{are constructed}} from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} <b>rotor</b> blades {{is derived from the}} BERP <b>rotor</b> blades first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} of the Mk1's metal <b>rotor</b> blades with aluminium and glass fibre composite <b>rotor</b> blades saw these aircraft designated Chinook HC Mk1B.

5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues. The engineers {{did not realize that}} the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft in the wind tunnel would not allow the helicopter to move relative to the <b>rotor,</b> as it did in flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of the <b>rotor</b> pitching motion. The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, the <b>rotor</b> oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive breakup of the helicopter.|$|E
5000|$|The second bank of five <b>rotors</b> was {{termed the}} control <b>rotors.</b> These were also 26-contact <b>rotors.</b> The control <b>rotors</b> {{received}} four signals at each step. After {{passing through the}} control <b>rotors,</b> the outputs were divided into ten groups of various sizes, ranging from 1 - 6 wires. Each group corresponded to an input wire for the next bank of <b>rotors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The third bank of <b>rotors</b> {{was called}} the index <b>rotors.</b> These <b>rotors</b> were smaller, with only ten contacts, and did not step during the encryption.

5|$|In the 1970s, Westland's {{experience}} with the Sea King led the company to conduct the British Experimental <b>Rotor</b> Program (BERP), in coordination with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which applied innovations in composite materials and new design principles to the helicopter <b>rotor.</b> Initial trials carried out with active Sea Kings found several advantages to the BERP <b>rotor,</b> including a longer fatigue life and improved aerodynamic characteristics. Subsequent Westland helicopters, such as the record-breaking Lynx and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, took advantage of BERP rotors for greater performance. Westland equipped later-built Sea Kings with the new composite rotors as well.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main <b>rotor,</b> low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the <b>rotor.</b> At such speeds, the <b>rotor</b> produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. <b>Rotor</b> tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a novel electrical machine. The {{purpose of the}} machine is to provide torque to the driving wheels of an electric vehicle. It thus contains two <b>rotors</b> mounted on separate but coaxial shafts and which can rotate at different speeds. Both the stator and the two <b>rotors</b> are of the disc configuration, the stator being sandwiched between the two <b>rotors.</b> The machine is excited by a three phase stator winding and the <b>rotors</b> are squirrel cage <b>rotors.</b> The cores are designed so that the two <b>rotors</b> do not act independantly but interact {{in such a way}} as to give optimum torque distribution between the two <b>rotors...</b>|$|R
50|$|In December 1938, the Army issued {{two extra}} <b>rotors</b> {{so that the}} three <b>rotors</b> were chosen from a set of five. In 1938, the Navy added two more <b>rotors,</b> and then another in 1939 to allow a choice of three <b>rotors</b> from a set of eight.|$|R

5|$|The RN's {{final order}} was for 44 ASW aircraft, {{originally}} designated Merlin HAS.1 but soon changed to Merlin HM1. The first fully operational Merlin was delivered on 17 May 1997, entering service on 2 June 2000. All aircraft were {{delivered by the}} end of 2002, and are operated by four Fleet Air Arm squadrons: 814 NAS, 820 NAS, 824 NAS and 829 NAS, all based at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall. 700 NAS was the Merlin Operational Evaluation Unit from 2000 to 2008. In March 2004, Navy Merlins were temporarily grounded following an incident at RNAS Culdrose in which a tail <b>rotor</b> failed due to a manufacturing defect. An improved tail <b>rotor</b> was designed and adopted on most AW101s; according to AgustaWestland, the redesigned <b>rotor</b> also significantly reduced associated maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The project {{suffered}} a setback on 12 March 1969, when the <b>rotor</b> on prototype #3 (s/n 66-8828) struck the fuselage and caused the aircraft to crash, killing the pilot, David A. Beil. The accident occurred {{on a test}} flight where the pilot was to manipulate the controls to excite 0.5P oscillations (or half-P hop) in the rotor; 0.5P is a vibration that happens once per two main <b>rotor</b> revolutions, where P is the rotor's rotational speed. The accident investigation noted that safety mechanisms on the controls had apparently been disabled for the flight. The investigation concluded that the pilot-induced oscillations {{had set up a}} resonant vibration that exceeded the <b>rotor</b> system's ability to compensate. After the investigation, the <b>rotor</b> and control systems were modified to prevent the same problem from occurring again.|$|E

40|$|Using minimal {{models for}} low Reynolds number passive and active <b>rotors</b> in a fluid, we {{characterize}} the hydrodynamic interac-tions among <b>rotors</b> {{and the resulting}} dynamics {{of a pair of}} interacting <b>rotors.</b> This allows us to treat in a common framework passive or externally driven <b>rotors,</b> such as magnetic colloids driven by a rotating magnetic field, and active or internally driven <b>rotors,</b> such as sperm cells confined at boundaries. The hydrodynamic interaction of passive <b>rotors</b> is known to contain an az-imuthal component ∼ 1 /r 2 to dipolar order that can yield the recently discovered “cooperative self-propulsion ” of a pair of <b>rotors</b> of opposite vorticity. While this interaction is identically zero for active <b>rotors</b> as a consequence of torque balance, we show that a ∼ 1 /r 4 azimuthal component of the interaction arises in active systems to octupolar order. Cooperative self-propulsion, although weaker, can therefore also occur for pairs of active <b>rotors.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Any {{curve of}} {{constant}} width can form a <b>rotor</b> within a square, a shape that can perform a complete rotation while staying within the square and {{at all times}} touching all four sides of the square. However, the Reuleaux triangle is the <b>rotor</b> with the minimum possible area. As it rotates, its axis does not stay fixed at a single point, but instead follows a curve formed by the pieces of four ellipses. Because of its 120° angles, the rotating Reuleaux triangle cannot reach some points near the sharper angles at the square's vertices, but rather covers a shape with slightly rounded corners, also formed by elliptical arcs.|$|E
5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main <b>rotor</b> and pioneering canted tail <b>rotor</b> assembly.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail <b>rotor</b> blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail <b>rotor</b> blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Further insufficiencies, such as <b>rotor</b> blade {{friction}} and drag, gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine. The basic relation that the turbine power is (approximately) {{proportional to the}} third power of velocity remains.|$|E

The submergence of the <b>rotors</b> and {{the distance between them}} were varied, and the rotational speeds of the <b>rotors</b> (Nn) were recorded at different wave frequencies. It was found that rotational speeds increased with an increase in the wave frequency, as it amplified the wave height that increased the kinetic energy of the particles in their orbital motion. The rotational speeds decreased when the distance between the <b>rotors</b> increased. High rotational speeds are recorded when the array of the <b>rotors</b> is placed close to the water surface at the smallest centre-to-centre distance between the <b>rotors...</b>|$|R

25|$|The UH-1H's dynamic {{components}} include the engine, transmission, <b>rotor</b> mast, main <b>rotor</b> blades, tail <b>rotor</b> driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the main <b>rotor.</b> The two-bladed, semi-rigid <b>rotor</b> design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The tail <b>rotor</b> is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a tail <b>rotor</b> speed approximately six times that of the main <b>rotor</b> to increase tail <b>rotor</b> effectiveness.|$|E
