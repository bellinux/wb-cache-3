25|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann {{opened up a}} new era in human history. It seems to me that what makes the science behind this discovery so <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was achieved by purely chemical means.|$|E
25|$|Also <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the suit}} now {{frequently}} appears in Rock, Heavy Metal and Gothic happenings, {{even though such}} groups were once known for a rather rebellious tradition of clothing. Artists and bands such as Nick Cave, Marilyn Manson, Blutengel and Akercocke are known {{for the use of}} formal clothing in music videos and stage performances. The suit also appears when fans dress for styles such as Lolita, Victorian and Corporate Gothic.|$|E
25|$|His {{greatest}} {{performance as}} a player, however, came in January 2000 when England played Zimbabwe in the fifth match of a triangular tournament held in South Africa. Ealham took five wickets for only 15 runs. At the time {{this was the best}} bowling performance by an Englishman in a one-day international match ever. Even more <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> all five wickets were LBWs. This is still a record in one-day international cricket.|$|E
50|$|Demis Nikolaidis {{played in}} the Final as footballer of Apollon, {{a few days before}} his {{transfer}} in AEK Athens. Also <b>remarkable</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Giannis Pathiakakis, coach of Apollon then, would coach AEK Athens 4 years later and would win the Cup.|$|R
50|$|Dundee was {{regarded}} as a skillful boxer with great footwork. During his career he had 330 bouts and won featherweight and junior lightweight titles. Only two fighters in history, Len Wickwar (463) and Jack Britton (350) had more fights than Dundee. Perhaps more <b>remarkable</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Dundee <b>was</b> knocked out only twice in his long career.|$|R
40|$|Excavation {{report for}} an {{excavation}} {{of the immediate}} vicinity of two megalithic passage graves (Dutch: hunebedden) of the Funnelbeaker culture (Dutch: TRB) period. Excavation yielded material culture from the Funnelbeaker culture period and Iron Age outbuildings. <b>Remarkable</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> stone-quarrying for the megalith may have occurred on the site, and that an Iron Age structure (possibly a house?) was built into the mound bodies that once capped the megalithic tombs...|$|R
25|$|One month later, on November 21, 1991, Caidic {{sets the}} PBA all-time {{records of the}} most points in a single game by a {{homegrown}} Filipino player (79 points), the most points in a single half (53 points), the most points in a single quarter (37 points), the most three-point field goals made and attempts in a game (17/27 triples), the most three-point field goals made in a quarter (8 triples) and the most consecutive three-point field goals made in a single game (8 triples), to lead Presto Tivoli against Ginebra San Miguel. His performance remains {{as one of the}} greatest individual performances in the PBA history. What makes it more <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> while he was playing in the court, his wife Millote was giving birth to their first daughter. He came off the bench late in the first quarter and left the game in the middle of the fourth, in a game where he could have possibly scored 100 points or more.|$|E

500|$|The Narragansett Pacer was not {{exclusively}} a pacing horse, as strong evidence indicates it exhibited an ambling gait, {{which is a}} four-beat, intermediate-speed gait, while the pace is a two-beat, intermediate-speed gait. The amble is more comfortable to ride than the pace, and Narragansett Pacers were known for their qualities as both riding and driving horses. They averaged around [...] tall, and were generally chestnut in color. James Fenimore Cooper described them as: [...] "They have handsome foreheads, the head clean, the neck long, the arms and legs thin and tapered."; however, another source stated, [...] "The hindquarters are narrow and the hocks a little crooked...", but also said, [...] "They are very spirited and carry both the head and tail high. But what is more <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they amble with more speed than most horses trot, {{so that it is}} difficult to put some of them upon a gallop." [...] Other viewers of the breed rarely called them stylish or good-looking, although they considered them dependable, easy to work with and sure-footed.|$|E
50|$|In a rare occurrence, {{all three}} Miss Tennessees 1999-2001 later won the similar Miss Tennessee USA pageant, whose delegates {{represent}} Tennessee at Miss USA. More <b>remarkable</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the three won the Miss Tennessee USA {{title in the}} order which they held their Miss Tennessee titles. Allison Alderson, one of the three, is a Triple Crown winner, having competed for Tennessee at Miss Teen USA 1994 as well.|$|R
5000|$|In 1965, CRH held {{an event}} where local {{politicians}} could be questioned about issues concerning {{gay and lesbian}} people, including police intimidation. The event marks the first known instance of [...] "the gay vote" [...] being sought, which led lesbian activist Barbara Gittings to say [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>remarkable.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> something <b>that</b> gay people in San Francisco were {{way ahead of the}} rest of the country in doing." ...|$|R

500|$|There's a Riot Goin' On was {{included}} on several music publications' [...] "End of the Year" [...] lists and critics' polls, including The Village Voices Pazz & Jop albums list at number seven. The album achieved commercial success with two hit singles and debuting at number-one on the Billboard Pop Albums and Soul Albums chart. It later {{came to be}} viewed by critics {{as one of the}} greatest and most influential albums. Christgau wrote in 2007 that the [...] "temptations and contradictions" [...] of commercial stardom consumed Sly Stone and resulted in [...] "the prophetic 1971" [...] album, [...] "its taped-over murk presaging Exile on Main St., its drum-machine beats throwing knuckleballs at [...] and , it was darker than the Velvet Underground and Nico and funkier than shit, yet somehow it produced two smash hits, including the stark, deep 'Family Affair'." [...] AllMusic described the album as [...] "funk at its deepest and most impenetrable," [...] stating that [...] "what makes Riot so <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's hard not to get drawn in with him, as you're seduced by the narcotic grooves, seductive vocals slurs, leering electric pianos, and crawling guitars." [...] Zeth Lundy of PopMatters deemed it [...] "a challenging listen, at times rambling, incoherent, dissonant, and just plain uncomfortable" [...] with [...] "some episodic moments of pop greatness to be found". Lundy went on to discuss its radical departure from the band's past music: ...|$|E

[...] What makes these papers <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in each case, Einstein boldly took an idea from theoretical physics to its logical consequences and managed to explain experimental results that had baffled scientists for decades.|$|E
50|$|Mother Hermine was {{a missionary}} who led her little flock of nuns to China {{where they were}} brutally murdered along with several other missionaries during the Boxer Rebellion. What <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> despite being warned of {{impending}} danger Mother Hermine inspired her sisters not to desert the orphans for whom they were working and faced death with a smile, singing praises of God. Hermine house has adopted her motto-"By Adversity To The Stars".|$|R
5000|$|Magic Johnson's {{performance}} in Game 6 and the series {{earned him the}} 1980 NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP). What made Johnson's performance even more <b>remarkable</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> an NBA rookie—and, indeed, one who had left college after only two years, and was only 20 years old. [...] "Jamaal Wilkes had an unbelievable game", said Johnson in 2011. [...] "Everybody talked about my 42 points, {{but it was also}} his effort." ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{much smaller}} group of English bands were formed in {{emulation}} of existing folk rock bands. Most often the model {{seems to have}} been Steeleye Span, as it was for the Cambridge group Spriguns of Tolgus, the Northumbrian band Hedgehog Pie and the Oyster Band, who started as the unpromising Fiddler's Dram in 1978. Fiddler's Dram were often dismissed as [...] "one hit wonders" [...] for their single [...] "Day Trip to Bangor", which peaked at no 3 in the UK and for their clear status as [...] "Steeleye Span soundalikes". What was <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they proved to have a singer-songwriter of genuine talent in Cathy Lesurf, and after she had left for the Albion Band in 1980 they became the Oyster Band (sometimes the Oysterband), an increasingly heavy and politically aware folk rock unit who produced some of the best work in the genre in the 1980s and 1990s, merging into the developing folk punk and independent scenes.|$|E
2500|$|They had ways of {{depicting}} rays {{of light}} that {{they put into practice}} ten years before most of their rivals attempted such dramatic atmospheric effects in the 1870s. The thing that makes these [...] "special effects" [...] of Clayton and Bell the more <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they were achieved with little resource to painted glass and flashed glass and without the multi-coloured Favrile glass used by Louis Comfort Tiffany studios and the Aesthetic designers of the United States. In fact, they used little more than radiating bands of red, yellow and white glass coupled with a formalised style of cloud painting that had been used by ancient stained glass and panel painters. The effects achieved by apparently simple means are often of overwhelming impact. A renowned example that is reproduced in various books on the topic of stained glass is the Last Judgement window of St Mary’s church, Hanley Castle, Worcestershire, dating from 1860.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{government}} pulled in regular Syrian troops from peripheral areas {{for the military}} assault on Aleppo, there was clear evidence that others are almost seamlessly moving into the vacuum left behind. And in some Kurdish parts of northern Syria the opposition forces of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and other smaller factions have all but taken over. The leader of the PYD, Salih Muslim, spoke to the BBC in recent days about his movement's strategy and aspirations. [...] "We are able to govern ourselves - {{we have the power}} for it," [...] he said. Mr Muslim was careful to insist, at this stage at least, that he wasn't calling for an independent Kurdistan but an autonomous region within a new, democratic Syria. It is thought that Kurdish militias now control at least four main towns and cities in northern Syria. They reportedly include at least parts of Qamishlo, Efrin, Amude, Terbaspi and Ayn El Arab. More <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> although there were sporadic clashes and some loss of life many of them appear to have been secured without much of a fight.|$|E
30|$|A <b>remarkable</b> point <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the low field {{mobility}} {{is obtained}} without the intrinsic huge noise in DSMC simulation {{at very low}} electric fields.|$|R
50|$|One {{other thing}} that made the {{excavation}} at Hvítárholt <b>remarkable</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> {{the first time a}} dig was carried out at a site <b>that</b> <b>is</b> mentioned nowhere in ancient texts. The longhouses were of roughly equal size; it has <b>been</b> suggested <b>that</b> this kind of multi-family settlement represents a pioneer stage, as also seen at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, where there were also several equally large buildings, and that all or most of the settlers later dispersed.|$|R

2500|$|At dusk, a 2,000-strong cavalry {{division}} under Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes rode into Arcis. A new 4,500-man Young Guard division led by Christophe Henrion made {{it as far}} as Plancy before {{stopping to}} rest. Sebastiani's rallied cavalry had bickered with Kaisarov's Allied horsemen all day. Deciding upon a night attack using Lefebvre-Desnouettes' fresh cavalry, Sebastiani placed Guard Lancers and Éclaireurs in the front rank, supported by cuirassiers. He hoped to silence an Allied artillery battery on Wrede's left flank. Sebastiani's [...] "magnificent" [...] charge smashed Kaisarov's Cossacks and then veered to the left, pressing back some Austrian regiments. What was <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the attack included the jaded troopers of Colbert and Exelmans, who were routed earlier in the day. A brigade of Russian grenadiers formed square and repelled the French horsemen. Bavarian, Russian, Austrian, and even a Prussian Guard cavalry squadron concentrated against the French, forcing their enemies to pull back, though they did it in good order. The cavalry of the two armies ended the fight with the village of Nozay between them.|$|E
2500|$|Constantia {{was born}} to an impoverished rural family in County Kilkenny. Her parents noticed her {{intelligence}} {{at an early age}} and furthered her desire to learn by every means that lay in their power. Her father sought advice on the matter, and, although he did not have much money, he was able to supply her with books suited, as he had been told, to the capacity of a child her age. But soon her parents found that her abilities were far beyond her years. Constantia was tutored in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, English, and French by her local vicar, but was mostly self-educated. According to one editor she was [...] "a most excellent scholar, not only in Greek and Roman literature, but in history, divinity, philosophy, and mathematics: and what makes her character the more <b>remarkable</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> she died so early as the age of 27, and that she acquired this great learning merely by the force of her own genius, and continual application." [...] Laetitia Pilkington felt [...] "her Learning appeared like the Gift poured out of the Apostles, of speaking all languages without the Pains of Study; or, like the intuitive Knowledge of Angels." ...|$|E

60|$|Most {{of these}} towns are very populous and large; but {{that which is}} most <b>remarkable</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the whole country round them is so {{interspersed}} with villages, and those villages so large, and so full of people, that they are equal to market-towns in other countries; in a word, they render this eastern part of Norfolk exceeding full of inhabitants.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Torrance is {{at present}} exquisitely employed; she is {{listening}} to Roger's step overhead. You, know what a delightful step the boy has. And what is more <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Emma {{is listening to}} it too, Emma who is seventeen, and who {{has been trying to}} keep Roger in his place ever since he first compelled her to bowl to him. Things have come to a pass when a sister so openly admits that she is only number two in the house.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the recent}} changes in the hierarchy, the system always had powers to impose {{unambiguous}} rules and guidelines that applied across the entire nation e.g. {{as to how the}} ballots will be cast and counted, what will be regarded as 'unqualified' vote. India {{was probably one of the}} first countries in the World to go for a completely electronic ballot in the last elections. What made this <b>remarkable</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Office of the Chief Election Commissioner had successfully implemented this across the entire diverse Indian population that also consisted of the rural illiterate people.|$|R
