25|$|Union Rotorua {{was a large}} <b>ro-ro</b> vessel {{operated}} on the trans Tasman route by the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand (USSCo). Along with her sister ship Union Rotoiti, she was unusual in that she originally had turbo-electric transmission.|$|E
25|$|The Ilmatars {{original}} {{interior layout}} was {{a compromise between}} the traditional two-class passenger liner and the new <b>ro-ro</b> car/passenger ferry. In order to transport cars she was fitted with a gate on the port side, from where cars were driven inside the ship and then lifted mechanically to the actual car deck. This arrangement was already out of date when the ship was delivered, as Finland SS Co.'s subsidiary Siljavarustamo had taken the delivery of the first <b>ro-ro</b> ferry with bow and rear gates on the North Baltic already in 1961. An extra cardeck was added on the ship coinciding with the 1973 lengthening, but that too was served by the side gate and a lift.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} years, Romário formed, along with fellow Brazilian forward Ronaldo, a feared attacking combo, which was colloquially {{referred to as}} the <b>Ro-Ro</b> duo. The first title which the strikers won while playing together in the front line, was the 1997 Copa América in Bolivia where they scored a total of eight goals. Later on in December 1997 they each scored a hat-trick in a 6–0 win against Australia in the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup final. Romário finished the tournament as the top-goalscorer with seven goals while Ronaldo added four. Just in 1997 the duo scored an impressive total of 34 international goals with 19 coming from Romário. The <b>Ro-Ro</b> attack was expected to headline the upcoming World Cup in France.|$|E
25|$|Finnlines’ <b>ro-ro</b> {{services}} in the Baltic and North Sea areas provide a backbone to Finnish industries’ transportation needs. The services covers the Finnish ports of Rauma, Uusikaupunki, Turku, Helsinki and Kotka, offering connections with Russian, Estonian, Polish, German, Danish, British, Dutch, Belgian and Spanish ports.|$|E
25|$|Union Rotorua {{was also}} {{interesting}} {{in its use}} of <b>ro-ro</b> for the Trans Tasman route. The cargo did not necessarily just contain truck and trailer units, but was also cargo stacked in the decks using forklifts. This necessitated the vehicle decks of the ship being build to withstand the loading of up to 39t per axle that could be exerted by a heavy forklift. Union Rotorua was built with a large angled stern ramp that allowed her to unload her cargo at any wharf {{without the need for}} a specialist linkspan as required by most <b>ro-ro</b> ships. She also had a bow door which could be used if a linkspan was present in a port, thus allowing cargo to be worked both forward and aft speeding up turn around time.|$|E

25|$|British Railways {{operating}} {{ships from}} 1948 until becoming Sealink in 1970 until replaced by British Channel Island Ferries in 1985. They operated {{in competition with}} Condor Ferries who had introducing Hydrofoils in 1977, then multihull’s from 1990 which took the passenger business and closed down the traditional ferries. <b>Ro-Ro</b> freight started in 1990 using new Commodore Shipping ships that also took passengers, operating under the Condor name from 2004.|$|E
25|$|The North Sea is {{important}} for marine transport and its shipping lanes are among the busiest in the world. Major ports are located along its coasts: Rotterdam, the busiest port in Europe and the fourth busiest port {{in the world by}} tonnage , Antwerp (was 16th) and Hamburg (was 27th), Bremen/Bremerhaven and Felixstowe, both in the top 30 busiest container seaports, as well as the Port of Bruges-Zeebrugge, Europe's leading <b>ro-ro</b> port.|$|E
25|$|DFDS Tor Line was {{the main}} freight-carrying {{division}} of DFDS. It operated {{a large number of}} <b>RO-RO</b> freighters on the North Sea as well as the Baltic Sea. It was formed as merger of DFDS' and Tor Line's freight operations after DFDS bought the latter in 1982 (until 1988 the passenger service between Sweden and the United Kingdom was also marketed as DFDS Tor Line). The operation of DFDS Tor Line were integrated into DFDS following the acquisition of Norfolkline in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Hildasay is a 7,606 GT <b>Ro-Ro</b> ferry {{which was}} built by Astilleros de Huelva SA, Huelva, Spain in 1999 as Leili for the Estonian Shipping Company, Tallinn. During a charter to Crowley Maritime she was renamed Port Everglades Express, {{reverting}} to Leili when the charter ended. In 2005, she was sold to Greece and renamed RR Shield. In 2008, she was sold to Seatruck Ferries, Heysham and renamed Shield. In January 2010 she was chartered to NorthLink Ferries and renamed Hildasay.|$|E
25|$|Empire Cedric was {{the first}} <b>ro-ro</b> ferry. She was built for the Royal Navy as the Landing Ship, Tank, HMS LST 3534. She was {{commissioned}} in 1945 and converted for civilian use as a ferry in 1948. She {{was used in the}} Irish Sea on routes between Preston and Larne, and Preston and Belfast. In 1956, she was requisitioned by the Royal Navy for a few months during the Suez Crisis as HMS Empire Cedric. She served until 1960 when she was scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Among ship types, a roll-on-roll-off (RORO or <b>ro-ro)</b> ship is {{more prone}} to {{capsizing}} as it has large open car decks near the waterline. If the watertight car-deck doors fail through damage or mismanagement (as in the partial sinking of , where the doors were accidentally left open), water entering the car-deck {{is subject to the}} free surface effect and may cause a capsize. As a RORO ferry rolls, vehicles can break free and slide down if not firmly secured, adversely altering the ship's centre of gravity, accelerating the roll, and possibly turning an otherwise recoverable roll into a capsize.|$|E
25|$|In 1989-1990, the tonnage on the Oslo—Copenhagen route was renewed {{with the}} {{entering}} into service in June 1990 of QUEEN OF SCANDINAVIA, a ship with {{a capacity of}} 2,000 passengers and 400 cars. QUEEN was followed, in 1994, by CROWN OF SCANDINAVIA, with a similar capacity. In 1999, DFDS took over Dan Transport Holding A/S, including the Dan Transport Travel Bureau and Canal Tours Copenhagen. However, 17 months later, the whole transport division, named DFDS Dan Transport Group A/S, was sold to transport group DSV, and the focus was once again on the former core business activities: <b>ro-ro</b> liner traffic and passenger shipping on overnight routes.|$|E
25|$|With {{the number}} of liner {{passengers}} between Europe and Australia dwindling, the Britanis was taken off liner service and rerouted to full-time cruising in 1975. During the same year the north Australian city of Darwin had been almost completely destroyed in a storm, and Patris found employment as a temporary accommodation ship for {{the residents of the}} destroyed city. This occupation lasted for only a year, after which a radically new use was found for the ship: she was converted into a <b>ro-ro</b> car/passenger ferry and used on services linking Ancona in Italy to Patras and Piraeus in Greece. In 1979 Patris was sold to Karageorgis Lines who retained her in the same service.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} strategic sealift vessel {{project was}} based on a proposal to acquire a converted <b>Ro-Ro</b> (Roll On - Roll Off) vessel from Japan as recommended by the Center of Naval Leadership & Excellence in 2009. Purchase and technical assistance was to be provided by the DBP Maritime Leasing Corporation Inc. (DMLC). It was one of the priority items in the wish list for purchase between 2012 and 2016 presented by the armed forces to the House of Representatives' committee on national defense and security on 26 January 2011. But this project did not push through due to delays in budget allocation and with the ship being offered and sold to another buyer.|$|E
25|$|Between 1946 and 1948, Empire Cedric {{was used}} on trooping duties between Tilbury and Hamburg, Germany. Empire Cedric entered service on 21 May 1948 on the Preston - Larne route, {{becoming}} the first commercial <b>ro-ro</b> ferry. She was certified to carry 50 passengers. Initially, there were two services per week. The service was so successful that an extra route between Preston and Belfast was opened in 1950, with services increasing to six or seven per week between the two routes. On 18 November 1949, Empire Cedric {{was involved in a}} collision with the coaster Topaz in fog in the Ribble Estuary. Empire Cedric appeared in a film made by Pathé News in 1949 about the delivery of prefabs from Gloucester to Northern Ireland.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, DFDS {{was one of}} {{the first}} to {{introduce}} a door-to-door solution. Two ships were specially designed to transport small wooden containers. DFDS commenced a new service, linking Danish mainland to Greenland. This was discontinued in 1959. In 1957, Nordana Line - cargo service Gulf of Mexico-Mediterranean - began. For the first time in DFDS's history, the company played the role of cross-trader. 1964 saw the introduction of the first <b>ro-ro</b> passenger ferry, when M.S. England entered service on a route connecting Esbjerg to Harwich. In 1965, the Transport Rationalization Department, which later became DFDS Transport, began its activities. M.S. AKERSHUS, the first real passenger-and-car ship which could also take trucks and trailers, was entered into service on the Frederikshavn-Oslo route.|$|E
25|$|Costing £2,500,000, Vortigern {{was built}} by Swan Hunter, Wallsend, Northumberland as Yard Number 10.
