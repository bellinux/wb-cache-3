30|$|Since its {{establishment}} in 1984, the MU radar has {{contributed significantly to}} our knowledge of turbulence, and gravity waves and their role in middle atmosphere dynamics (e.g., Fukao and Hamazu 2014, see also reviews by Kato 2005; Tsuda 2014). Under some important, but not necessarily robust hypotheses, turbulence parameters can be retrieved, mainly from the radar echo power and from the spectral width of Doppler echoes (e.g., Hocking 1985, 1999; Fukao et al. 1994). However, {{there are still some}} pending issues about the accuracy (and validity) of the VHF radar-derived turbulence parameter estimates, because the data processing methods used are difficult to validate and because the VHF radar backscatter mechanisms are complex and still not fully understood (e.g., Röttger and Larsen 1990; Hocking 2011). Quantitative comparisons with estimates from simultaneous in situ <b>radiosonde</b> (<b>balloon)</b> measurements are useful for better understanding the radar observations (e.g., Luce et al. 2014) but difficult due to the different nature of the two measurements. The radar measurements provide volume- and time-averaged, remotely sensed parameters at a fixed location, while balloon measurements are local and nearly instantaneous along the balloon path, but semi-Lagrangian. A rigorous comparison of balloon measurements with radar measurements is problematic because the radiosondes drift away, often quite rapidly, from the radar location due to horizontal winds. The horizontal inhomogeneity and intermittency inherent to turbulence can therefore prevent meaningful comparisons from being made.|$|E

The images were recorded using the AGA Thermovision 780 with an IBM AT computer using CATS 2. 1 software.

40|$|AbstractPrecipitation in {{the cold}} sector of mid-latitude, extratropical {{cyclones}} has come under scrutiny recently, especially banded rain and snow that occurs poleward, and often upstream (“wraparound precipitation”), of the surface cyclone center (usually called the “northwest quadrant”). The Profiling of Winter Storms (PLOWS) project was conducted {{during the winter months}} of early 2009, and again during the 2009 - 2010 winter season, to gather data on such storms. During this time, data from 138 high-resolution radiosonde flights were collected to establish, in part, the static stability conditions in which wraparound precipitation occurred. Of chief interest in this paper is the prevalence of conditions conducive to upright convection in the sampled storms. Indeed, {{all but one of the}} 17 sampled storms presented upright convection (verified by radar) in the wraparound region, so the static stability values reported herein are likely underestimates due, in part, to the unique path of each <b>radiosonde</b> <b>balloon.</b> Of the 17 storms that were sampled, 12 (71 %) captured at least one sounding with elevated convective available potential energy (CAPE), while of the 138 individual soundings, only 52 (38 %) had elevated CAPE. We may thus conclude that the majority of sampled cyclones revealed elevated CAPE, but it was often short-lived. Those soundings also revealed that the most unstable CAPE values appear about 3 hours prior to the onset of wraparound precipitation, but still had a median value of 77 J kg- 1 at the time of onset...|$|E

Gravity wave activity and seasonal behavior {{was found to}} be similar to that seen in earlier studies from Antarctica. Interstation comparisons of zonal wind and gravity wave activity showed very high correlations throughout the entire data set, between Mawson and Davis stations (∼ 600 km distant), with a lag near 0. 5 days. The correlations between Casey and Davis (1400 km apart) were lower but still significant, with a lag near 1 day. There is no significant correlation between stratospheric gravity wave activity and surface winds. Our results suggest a pattern of winds and waves moving eastward over the stations with a speed near 15 m s− 1. As this is comparable to planetary wave speeds, we interpret our results as being evidence for a significant planetary wave–induced modulation of the zonal wind and the gravity wave field, although we are unable to identify the mechanism by which this operates. Our work suggests that the high-latitude lower-stratosphere gravity wave fields are relatively uniform on spatial scales of 500 – 1000 km and on timescales of around 0. 5 – 1 days. Innis, J. L., A.

This paper presents the first high resolution vertical charge profiles during fair weather conditions obtained with instrumented <b>radiosonde</b> <b>balloons</b> over Alqueva, Portugal during the summer of 2014. The short intervals (4 hours) between balloon flights enabled the diurnal variation in the vertical profile of charge within the boundary layer to be examined in detail, with much smaller charges (up to 20 pCm- 3) observed during stable night time periods than during the day. Following sunrise, the evolution of the charge profile was complex, demonstrating charged ultrafine aerosol, lofted upwards by daytime convection. This produced charge up to 92 pCm- 3 up to 500 m above the surface. The diurnal variation in the integrated column of charge above the site tracked closely with the diurnal variation in near surface charge as derived from a nearby electric field mill, confirming the importance of the link between surface charge generation processes and aloft. The local aerosol vertical profiles were estimated using backscatter measurements from a collocated ceilometer. These were utilised in a simple model to calculate the charge expected due to vertical conduction current flow in the global electric circuit through aerosol layers. The analysis presented here demonstrates that charge can provide detailed information about boundary layer transport, particularly in regard to the ultrafine aerosol structure, that conventional thermodynamic and ceilometer measurements do not...|$|R

Since its commissioning in 1982, POLARSTERN has conducted 30 campaigns to Antarctica (157 legs, mostly austral summer), and 29 to the Arctic (94 legs, northern summer). Usually, POLARSTERN is more than 300 days per year in operation and crosses the Atlantic Ocean in a meridional section twice a year.

And these daily soundings have continued up to the present. Due to the fact that POLARSTERN has reliably and regularly been providing upper air observations from data sparse regions (oceans and polar regions), the radiosonde data are of special value for researchers and weather forecast services alike.
