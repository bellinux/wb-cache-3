40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> are a {{relatively}} new stress test instrument that aims at finding exactly those scenarios that cause a bank to cross the frontier between survival and default. Afterward, the scenario which is most probable has to be identified. This paper sketches a framework for a quantitative reverse stress test for maturity-transforming banks that are exposed to credit and interest rate risk and demonstrates how the model can be calibrated empirically. The main features of the proposed framework are: 1) The necessary steps of a reverse stress test (solving an inversion problem and computing the scenario probabilities) can be performed within one model, 2) Scenarios are characterized by realizations of macroeconomic risk factors, 3) Principal component analysis helps to reduce the dimensionality of the space of systematic risk factors, 4) Due to data limitations, the results of <b>reverse</b> <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> are exposed to considerable model and estimation risk, which makes numerous robustness checks necessary...|$|E
40|$|In Tunisia {{substantial}} {{economic and}} financial vulnerability are mainly caused by the civil unrest and the subsequent regime change after the Tunisian revolution in 2011. In order to quantify this fragility, in this paper, we use <b>reverse</b> <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> (RST) based on combination of relevant risk factors {{that lead to the}} worst case in which the bank becomes unviable and insolvent. Given the financial <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> scenarios shortcomings (i. e. plausibility, subjectivity), the use of RST methodology is {{explained by the fact that}} it identify the probability of realization of such scenarios. We apply this new methodology on Tunisian banks which are the core for financial stability; more specifically, we focus on credit risk RST. We choose the upper bound for value at risk (VaR) in order to identify worst VaR at probability of realization a. Our proposed framework relies on the logistic regression to identify stress probability and the linear regression of financial stress index output gap versus macroeconomic risk factors in order to search for scenarios at 1 %, 3 % and 5 % levels of plausibility. Empirical results show that Tunisian banks have likely to reach the WVaR in 2012 at 5 % level. Besides the more extreme the scenarios which are considered the less plausible they become. Our reverse FST is a complement, and never a substitute for risk manager and what matters most is the mindset of those employing it.

This <b>reverse</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> can be used to identify the potential triggers of systemic events, and it removes the arbitrariness in the selection of shock scenarios in <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> We consider in particular the case of distress propagation in an interbank market, and we study a network of 44 European banks, which we reconstruct using data collected from Bloomberg. By looking at the distribution across banks of the size of smallest exogenous shocks we rank banks in terms of their systemic importance, and we show the effectiveness of a policy with capital requirements based on this ranking. We also study the properties of smallest exogenous shocks {{as a function of the}} largest eigenvalue λ_ max of the matrix of interbank leverages, which determines the endogenous amplification of shocks. We find that the size of smallest exogenous shocks reduces and that the distribution across banks becomes more localized as λ_ max increases. Comment: 19 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

By choosing the scenario in Qα which minimises net asset value {{at the end of the}} time period, we propose the idea of the least solvent likely event (LSLE) as a solution to the forward <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> problem. By considering the support function of the convex scenario set Qα, we establish theoretical properties of the LSLE when financial risk factors can be assumed to have a linear effect on the net assets of an insurer. In particular, we show that the LSLE may be interpreted as a scenario causing a loss equivalent to the Value-at-Risk (VaR) at confidence level α, provided the α-quantile is a subadditive risk measure on linear combinations of the risk factors. In this case, we also show that the LSLE has an interpretation as a per-unit allocation of capital to the underlying risk factors when the overall capital is determined according to the VaR. These insights allow us to define alternative scenario sets that relate in similar ways to coherent measures, such as expected shortfall.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a method for}} selecting and analysing stress scenarios for financial risk assessment, with particular emphasis on identifying sensible combinations of stresses to multiple factors. We focus primarily on <b>reverse</b> <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> – finding the most likely scenarios leading to losses exceeding a given threshold. We approach this problem using a nonparametric empirical likelihood estimator of the conditional mean of the underlying market factors given large losses. We then scale confidence regions for the conditional mean by a coefficient {{that depends on the}} tails of the market factors to estimate the most likely loss scenarios. We provide rigorous justification for the confidence regions and the scaling procedure when the joint distribution of the market factors and portfolio loss is elliptically contoured. We explicitly characterize the impact of the heaviness of the tails of the distribution, contrasting a broad spectrum of cases including exponential tails and regularly varying tails. The key to this analysis lies in the asymptotics of the conditional variances and covariances in extremes. These results also lead to asymptotics for marginal expected shortfall and the corresponding variance, conditional on a market stress; we combine these results with empirical likelihood significance tests of systemic risk rankings based on marginal expected shortfall in stress scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of packaged GaN HEMTs for high power applications {{has been studied}} under long term <b>reverse</b> bias step <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> Increases of leakage current and dynamic Ron resistance have been found.

40|$|Fatigue curves (stress vs cycles to failure) were {{generated}} under {{a variety of}} conditions (temperatures, fluid environments, mean stresses, block loadings) for a candidate automotive structural composite. The results were used to (1) develop observations regarding basic fatigue behavioral characteristics and (2) establish fatigue design rules. The composite was a structural reaction injection-molded polyurethane reinforced with continuous strand, swirl-mat E-glass fibers. Tensile fatigue tests on specimens from a single plaque at {minus} 40 F, room temperature, and 250 F provided the basic behavioral characteristics. It was found that when stress was normalized by the at-temperature ultimate tensile strength, the fatigue curves at the three temperatures collapsed into a single master curve. An assessment of the individual stress-strain loops throughout each test showed a progressive loss in stiffness and an increase in permanent strain, both of which are indicative of increasing damage. Fatigue tests on specimens from several plaques were used to develop a design fatigue curve, which was established by using a reduction factor of 20 on average cycles to failure. This factor assures that the stiffness loss during the design life is no greater than 10 percent. Fatigue reduction factors were established to account for various fluids. <b>Reversed</b> <b>stress</b> fatigue <b>tests</b> allowed a mean stress rule to be validated, and block loading tests were used to demonstrate the adequacy of Miner`s rule for cumulative fatigue damage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Shrimp is an {{important}} traded fishery commodity. When subjected to stress, shrimp usually suffers from oxidative stress, which leads to cell injury, senescence, and death. To maintain shrimp good health, performance and production, antioxidant and immune systems are important. Natural antioxidants found in microalgae {{may be used to}} increase the cell protection against oxidative damage, being a promising alternative to the carcinogenic synthetic antioxidants. In this study, Tetraselmis chuii was evaluated for its effect on survival, growth and oxidative stress biomarkers on Litopenaeus vannamei postlarvae (PL). The antioxidant properties of the formulated feed with T. chuii inclusion were determined using four antioxidant chemical assays. Meanwhile, the oxidative stress biomarkers on PL were analyzed by hydrogen peroxide, membrane stability and lipid peroxidation assays. Results showed that PL reared on diets supplemented with 50 % T. chuii had a significantly higher (P ≤  0. 05) survival (97. 6  ±  1. 4 %) and lower oxidative stress in terms of hydrogen peroxide content (10. 08  ±  0. 4  mM g− 1 FW) and electrolyte leakage (10. 8  ±  0. 3 %). The result of this study also showed that shrimp PL reared on diets supplemented with microalgal, T. chuii have high resistance to <b>reverse</b> salinity <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> (76. 7 – 100 %). However, no significant differences (P ≥  0. 05) were found in the growth and lipid peroxidation.

Therefore, it is {{important}} to understand the effect of such <b>reverse</b> <b>stress</b> in commercially competitive PV technologies such as CIGS. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of moderate reverse bias on solution-processed CIGS solar cells. We subject the solar cells to varying degrees of reverse biases and continuously monitor the impact of the stress on dark current. We also explore the relaxation behavior of dark current following passive storage and the long term effect of the shadow stress on power output of the cell. We find that the <b>reverse</b> <b>stress</b> affects only the localized shunt current paths, without affecting the bulk device characteristics. The shunt current exhibits a metastable change with <b>reverse</b> <b>stress,</b> and can increase or decrease on application of <b>reverse</b> <b>stress.</b> We analyze this phenomenon in detail, and discuss the hypothesis that can explain its characteristic features.
