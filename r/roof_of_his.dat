5|$|In {{the midst}} of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a {{granulated}} surface {{on the left side of}} Cleveland's hard palate. Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum. The diagnosis was not a malignant cancer, but instead an epithelioma.|$|E
5|$|Debby also dropped up to 12inches (30.5mm) of {{rainfall}} across Puerto Rico {{in less than}} 48hours, causing mudslides and damage to bridges and roads; however, most of the island territory only received 3inches (7.62mm) of precipitation. The maximum rainfall on the island was 12.63inches (32mm) in RÃ­o Piedras, Puerto Rico. Additionally, 12.16inches (31mm) of precipitation was recorded near Cayey, though there were unofficial reports of 17inches (43mm) in the interior mountains of the region. The hurricane dropped around 5inches (127mm) of rain in San Juan, producing slick roads that resulted in several minor car accidents. There were 406homes affected from the flooding, 5of which were moderately to severely damaged. Losses in Puerto Rico reached $501,000, primarily in the Caguas municipality. The storm was also indirectly {{responsible for the death}} of a 78-year-old man who fell while trying to remove a satellite dish from the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home.|$|E
5|$|Across much of Luzon, Irma {{flattened}} {{houses and}} flooding streets, resulting in considerable damage. Irma brought down power lines, {{which led to}} blackouts along the suburbs of Manila. One army officer died via electrocution while trying to fix the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dwelling in Makati. Many other deaths occurred when they were crushed to death under collapsed houses or killed by flying debris. For instance, two people died when their house on Mindoro Island collapsed and a farmer in Quezon died after {{being hit by a}} falling coconut. Elsewhere on Midoro Island, 60 homes were destroyed. Offshore, eighteen fisherman were listed as missing. Twenty-six of the casualties happened in Manila while 12others died in the rural town of Daet along the southern part of Luzon due to flooding and falling debris. Due to the storm, iron sheets were littered across the slums of Manila. Communication lines between Daet and Manila were disconnected; many villages between the two location were destroyed. In Lucena, two people were killed and many coconuts were tossed from trees. In Bulacan, civil defense officials advised thousands of inhabitants {{on the banks of the}} Angat River to flee as water along the river threatened to overflow their banks. In the Rizal province, one agency reported that it dispatched several army trucks to fetch roughly 2,000stranded 12- to 15-year-old boy scouts. In a nearby park, the typhoon blew down houses, power poles, billboards and trees. Even though the Clark Air Base and Subic Bay, both United States-run, sustained little damage, six C-130 transports had to be evacuated to the Kadena Air Base in Okinawa and ships, including the aircraft carrier Constellation. Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos ordered the closure of all government offices in affected areas, which included the capital city of Manila. Additionally, many private offices sent their employees home.|$|E

50|$|Between 1862 and 1863, Edmond Frette {{arrived in}} Monza. There, {{established}} another {{branch of the}} company, {{and in the second}} half of the 1860s, Edmond was able to concentrate production under the <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own factories: in Concorezzo, products for the private individuals; in Sovico, coarse products for the large communities (hotels, the army, boarding-schools). The latter production represented by large the most important part of Frette's trade.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout his life, Hevelius took {{a leading}} part in {{municipal}} administration, becoming town councillor in 1651; but from 1639 on, his chief interest was astronomy. In 1641 he built an observatory on the <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> three connected houses, equipping it with splendid instruments, ultimately including a large Keplerian telescope of [...] focal length, [...] with a wood and wire tube he constructed himself.

6000|$|Tom turned away; {{his heart}} was full. The hope of liberty, the thought of distant wife and children, rose up before his patient soul, as to the mariner shipwrecked almost in port rises {{the vision of the}} church-spire and loving <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> native village, seen over the top of some black wave only for one last farewell. He drew his arms tightly over his bosom, and choked back the bitter tears, and tried to pray. The poor old soul had such a singular, unaccountable {{prejudice}} in favor of liberty, that it was a hard wrench for him; and the more he said, [...] "Thy will be done," [...] the worse he felt.|$|R

25|$|It {{is known}} that Nedim died in 1730 during the Janissary revolt {{initiated}} by Patrona Halil, but there are conflicting stories as to the manner of his death.

Another story, however, claims that he {{died as a result of}} excessive drinking, while a third story relates how Nedim â terrified by the tortures enacted upon Ibrahim Pasha and his retinue â suddenly died of fright. Nedim is buried in the ÃskÃ¼dar district of Istanbul.|$|E

That said, when abroad, the standards of members of the family may well be flown: examples include Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince William.|$|E

Shock waves rumble across the city, shattering glass and the exteriors of surrounding buildings and disintegrating the rider and his horse. The reverberation affects Metallica's concert, cutting the power and knocking down lighting trusses.

Then he turned, facing again the spacious, handsome room with its heavy, semi-ecclesiastical furniture, and Sir Terence, who, hunched in his chair at the ponderously carved black writing-table, scowled fiercely at nothing.|$|R
25|$|As {{a policy}} of {{controlling}} and rewarding his generals, Mari Djata adopted their sons. These children were raised at the mansas court and became Keitas upon reaching maturity. Seeing the throne as their right, two adopted sons of Mari Djata waged a devastating war against one another that threatened to destroy what the first two mansas had built. The first son to gain the throne was Mansa Ouati Keita (also spelt Wati) in 1270. He reigned for four years, spending lavishly and ruling cruelly, according to the djelis. Upon his death in 1274, the other adopted son seized the throne. Mansa Khalifa Keita is remembered as even worse than Ouati Keita. According to the djelis, he governed just as badly, was insane and fired arrows from the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> palace at passers by. Ibn Khaldun recounts that the people rushed upon him and killed him during a popular revolt. The Gbara replaced him with Manding Bory Keita in 1275.|$|E
25|$|Seven weeks later, on 21 September a {{party of}} Defenders was routed by a smaller but better armed {{coalition}} of 'wreckers' at the Diamond, 4 miles from Drumcree. The 'wreckers' were {{under the command of}} a Captain Giffard from Dublin. William Blacker, a member of the landed gentry and commander of the Seagoe Yeomanry, was later attributed a role in the affray. He is said to have stripped lead from the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house to make ammunition in preparation for the ambush of Catholic Defenders at the Diamond. However, we could find nothing to support this and it may be no more than a piece of Orange legend that helped establish an affinity with the aristocracy {{in the minds of the}} Protestant peasantry. It was after the Diamond skirmish that the name 'Orange Boys' was adopted. This was changed to 'the Orange Order' as the âwreckersâ became more organised under the leadership of Blacker and James Verner, an attorney and agent for the Armagh estates of absentee landlord, Lord Charlemont.|$|E

60|$|It {{was in a}} {{state of}} quiet contentment that Jimmy stood on his bridge, as the Shasta steamed past the Stanley pines into sight <b>of</b> the {{clustering}} <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> Vancouver. <b>His</b> first voyage had been an unqualified success in every respect, and it was clear that the Shasta had done considerably more than cover her working expenses. This was in several ways a great relief to him, since it promised to obviate any difficulty in providing for his father's comfort, and also opened up the prospect of a career for himself. Jordan had assured him before he sailed that they would have no great trouble in raising funds to purchase another boat if the results of the venture warranted it. He had also said that since one thing led to another, there was no reason why the Shasta Company should not run several steamers by and by, in which case Jimmy would naturally become commodore-captain or general superintendent of the fleet.|$|R
50|$|He {{was educated}} at Latymer School, where he first became {{interested}} in art. He later studied at Hornsey Art School where he specialized in commercial and fine art and charcoal. He painted in both water colors and oils, but preferred the use of water colors. In order to provide for his family Eric took up commercial art and in the 1950s he was commissioned by Abbey National Building Society to design their logo, which became their famous trademark of two people sheltering under the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> a house. <b>His</b> design was accepted and for many years became the 'face' of the Abbey National. The inspiration for this logo was a house opposite his studio in Broxbourne which unusually had a four-sided roof.|$|R

Devastated, he attempts to jump from the <b>roof</b> terrace <b>of</b> <b>his</b> office but his colleagues manage to hold him back. However, in their grapple they knock over a flowerpot, which falls onto the street below, narrowly missing the car of lawyer Sandra. Just then Max pulls into the parking space which Sandra believed to have finally found {{after half an hour}} of searching. After a heated discourse she finally arrives at her office, late for an appointment with a client. That client is Mrs Marangoni, who wants to file for divorce after her husband has left her. Believing he is cheating on her, she is seeking revenge. Sandra reveals her own recent disappointment with her ex-boyfriend, and the two women quickly bond. Unbeknownst to Sandra, her clientâs husband is no one other than Max, with whom she had just been fighting over the parking space.|$|R
