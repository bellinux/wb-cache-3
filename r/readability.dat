5|$|The three-languages {{wayfinding}} {{system for}} the Louvre Abu Dhabi was designed by Philippe Apeloig, and is implemented in both Arabic and Roman script. Frutiger LT typeface has been chosen for the Roman texts for its perfect <b>readability</b> for signage; while Lebanese typographer Kristyan Sarkis created an Arabic bespoked typeface, the LAD Arabic, based on the classic Naskh style and his Colvert Arabic font.|$|E
5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on <b>readability.</b> In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E
5|$|Python is {{a widely}} used {{high-level}} programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code <b>readability</b> (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{faculty at}} UCF {{includes}} many notable and prestigious members, including two former United States Ambassadors, {{a former member}} United States Congressman, and a former Vice President of Walt Disney Creative Entertainment, to name a few. Faculty also includes winners of the Pulitzer Prize and Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize, {{in addition to the}} developer of the Flesch–Kincaid <b>readability</b> tests, and the authors of the Mathematical Circles and Political Analysis series. Due to the work of professors and the Florida Space Institute, UCF will become the first Florida university to lead a NASA mission.|$|E
5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining <b>readability</b> and {{clarity of the}} units and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
5|$|The pre-1980 subway {{stations}} of the Bloor–Danforth line follow a two-colour background and trim theme and use the unique Toronto Subway font on the stations' walls. The tiling theme {{was influenced by the}} Broad Street Subway in Philadelphia and used a cycle that was similar to the design employed on the Yonge subway. This design consists of two colours for the tiles, one for main wall tiles and another for trim tiles near the ceiling of the stations. The station names on the main wall tiles use the colour of the trim tiles and vice versa, except that some of the station names of the trim tiles are white instead of the main wall tile colour for <b>readability.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ARRL has a <b>readability</b> {{standard}} for robot encoders called ARRL Farnsworth Spacing {{that is supposed}} to have higher <b>readability</b> for both robot and human decoders. Some programs like WinMorse have implemented the standard.|$|E
25|$|The Flesch–Kincaid <b>readability</b> {{tests are}} <b>readability</b> tests {{designed}} {{to indicate how}} difficult a passage in English is to understand. There are two tests, the Flesch Reading Ease, and the Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level. Although they use the same core measures (word length and sentence length), they have different weighting factors.|$|E
25|$|Generation of {{document}} statistics (characters, words, <b>readability</b> level, {{time spent}} editing by each user).|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} function can be {{used for}} more complicated structures for the sake of <b>readability.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{underscore}} symbol separates digits {{in number}} values for <b>readability</b> purposes. Compiler will ignore it.|$|E
25|$|To improve <b>readability,</b> {{the names}} of the {{stations}} and lines are the latest (or last) used.|$|E
25|$|Camel {{case has}} been criticised as {{negatively}} impacting <b>readability</b> due to the removal of spaces and uppercasing of every word.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} {{parentheses}} in {{the definition}} {{is to ensure that}} any formula can only be obtained in one way by following the inductive definition (in other words, there is a unique parse tree for each formula). This property is known as unique <b>readability</b> of formulas. There are many conventions for where parentheses are used in formulas. For example, some authors use colons or full stops instead of parentheses, or change the places in which parentheses are inserted. Each author's particular definition must be accompanied by a proof of unique <b>readability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Manual {{optimization}} sometimes has {{the side}} effect of undermining <b>readability.</b> Thus code optimizations should be carefully documented (preferably using in-line comments), and their effect on future development evaluated.|$|E
25|$|Editor's note: For {{improved}} <b>readability</b> of {{the text}} and better use of space, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen will be referred to simply as 'Georgescu' in the remainder of the present article.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Dave Yost {{suggested}} that chemists use medial capitals to aid <b>readability</b> of long chemical names, e.g. write AmidoPhosphoRibosylTransferase instead of amidophosphoribosyltransferase. This usage was not widely adopted.|$|E
25|$|They lack <b>readability.</b> DTD {{designers}} typically make {{heavy use}} of parameter entities (which behave essentially as textual macros), which {{make it easier}} to define complex grammars, but at the expense of clarity.|$|E
25|$|Mobile customizations: swipe gesture tab switching, link preview allows zooming in on (multiple) {{links to}} ensure the desired one is clicked, font size {{boosting}} to ensure <b>readability</b> regardless of the zoom level.|$|E
25|$|Archistar {{utilizes}} a slim BFT layer for communication. It prototypes {{a secure}} multi-cloud storage system using Java licensed under LGPLv2. Focus lies on simplicity and <b>readability,</b> {{it aims to}} be the foundation for further research projects.|$|E
25|$|Sans serif (lit. without serif) designs {{appeared}} relatively {{recently in}} the history of type design. The first, similar to slab serif designs, was shown in 1816 by William Caslon IV. Sans serif fonts are commonly but not exclusively used for display typography such as signage, headings, and other situations demanding legibility above high <b>readability.</b> The text on electronic media offers an exception to print: most web pages and digitized media are laid out in sans serif typefaces because serifs often detract from <b>readability</b> at the low resolution of displays. Many have minimal variation in stroke width, creating the impression of a minimal, simplified design.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{although}} {{various studies}} have been conducted on the <b>readability</b> of proportional vs. monospaced fonts, the studies typically did not decrease sentence spacing when using proportional fonts, or did not specify whether sentence spacing was changed.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{regarding}} <b>readability</b> {{were raised}} in a study published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and {{a study published in}} Psychological Medicine (2012), while {{a study published in the}} European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology raised concerns about reliability.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{consistent}} or standardized romanization systems. They {{can be classified}} by their characteristics. A particular system’s characteristics may make it better-suited for various, sometimes contradictory applications, including document retrieval, linguistic analysis, easy <b>readability,</b> faithful representation of pronunciation.|$|E
25|$|Syntax {{highlighting}} is {{one strategy}} {{to improve the}} <b>readability</b> and context of the text; especially for code that spans several pages. The reader can easily ignore large sections of comments or code, depending on what they are looking for.|$|E
25|$|He is {{an expert}} on <b>Readability,</b> {{especially}} of school text books, and has written articles on this subject for the School Science Review, a journal of The Association for Science Education, and other publications. which has been cited by 52 scholarly articles.|$|E
25|$|Optimization {{can reduce}} <b>readability</b> and add code {{that is used}} only to improve the performance. This may complicate {{programs}} or systems, making them harder to maintain and debug. As a result, optimization or performance tuning is often performed {{at the end of}} the development stage.|$|E
25|$|Sentence spacing studies analyse {{the effects}} of {{sentence}} spacing techniques on the <b>readability</b> of text. The only direct scientific {{studies have been conducted}} by researchers from the University of Georgia, for on-screen text. There are currently no direct sentence spacing studies for printed text.|$|E
25|$|Version 1.1 firmware, {{available}} as a free download since July 24, 2008 adds support for the EPUB format, Adobe Digital Editions 1.5 and Adobe DRM protected PDF files, automatic reflow of PDF files formatted for larger pages enlarges the text to improve <b>readability,</b> and support for high capacity SDHC memory cards.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} test to confirm distemper is a brush border slide of the bladder transitional epithelium {{of the inside}} lining from the bladder, stained with Dif-Quick. These infected cells have inclusions which stain a carmine red color, found in the paranuclear cytoplasm <b>readability.</b> About 90% of the bladder cells will be positive for inclusions {{in the early stages}} of distemper.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Meher Baba asked his American disciple Don E. Stevens to re-edit the Discourses from their {{original}} five-volume set, {{with an eye}} to improving their <b>readability.</b> The result was released in 1967 as a three-volume set published by Sufism Reoriented known as the sixth edition. The sixth edition of Discourses sold well and received five printings, 1967, 1968, 1970, 1971, and 1973.|$|E
25|$|Words {{are rarely}} not listed in {{dictionaries}} (in which case {{they would be}} lexical items) {{on the basis of}} their inflectional morphemes. However, they often are listed {{on the basis of their}} derivational morphemes. For instance, English dictionaries list readable and <b>readability,</b> words with derivational suffixes, along with their root read. However, no traditional English dictionary lists book as one entry and books as a separate entry; the same goes for jump and jumped.|$|E
25|$|XBRL {{facilitates}} {{the development of}} continuous auditing modules by providing a way for systems to {{understand the meaning of}} tagged data. Proper use of XBRL assures that relevant data gathered from multiple sources is easily comparable and analyzable. XBRL is a derivative of the XML file format, which tags data with contextual and hierarchical information. It is expected that many enterprise resource planning systems will provide data in the XBRL-GL format to facilitate machine <b>readability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{web pages}} employ {{sans-serif}} type. Hinting information, spatial anti-aliasing, and subpixel rendering technologies have partially mitigated {{the perception of}} serif fonts on screen. Due to the basic constraint of screen resolution (typically 100 pixels per inch or less) the serifs in some fonts {{can be difficult to}} discern on screen. Some serif fonts, such as Georgia, are specially designed for web <b>readability,</b> employing higher x-heights in the letters, as well as sturdier serifs.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{scholars}} {{participated in}} the study of the Stele during the 1980s. Wang Jianqun interviewed local farmers and decided that no intentional fabrication occurred, adding that the lime on the Stele was pasted by local copy-making workers to enhance <b>readability.</b> Xu Jianxin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences discovered the earliest rubbed copy which was made before 1881. He also concluded that there was no evidence the Japanese had intentionally damaged any of the characters on the Stele.|$|E
