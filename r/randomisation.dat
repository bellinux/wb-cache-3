25|$|In {{a random}} {{sequence}} of numbers, a number {{may be said}} to be cursed because it has come up less often in the past, and so it is thought that it will occur less often in the future. A number may be assumed to be blessed because it has occurred more often than others in the past, and so it is thought likely to come up more often in the future. This logic is valid only if the <b>randomisation</b> is biased, for example with a loaded die. If the die is fair, then previous rolls give no indication of future events.|$|E
25|$|Newer {{portable}} media {{players are}} now coming with Internet access via Wi-Fi. Examples of such devices are Android OS devices by various manufacturers, and iOS devices on Apple products like the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. Internet access has even enabled {{people to use}} the Internet as an underlying communications layer for their choice of music for automated music <b>randomisation</b> services like Pandora, to on-demand video access (which also has music available) such as YouTube. This technology has enabled casual and hobbyist DJs to cue their tracks from a smaller package from an Internet connection, sometimes they will use two identical devices on a crossfade mixer. Many such devices {{also tend to be}} smartphones.|$|E
25|$|Hill had a {{distinguished}} career {{in research and}} teaching and as author of a very successful textbook, Principles of Medical Statistics, but he is famous for two landmark studies. He was the statistician on the Medical Research Council Streptomycin in Tuberculosis Trials Committee and their study evaluating the use of streptomycin in treating tuberculosis, is generally accepted as the first randomised clinical trial. The use of <b>randomisation</b> in agricultural experiments had been pioneered by Ronald Aylmer Fisher. The second study was rather {{a series of studies}} with Richard Doll on smoking and lung cancer. The first paper, published in 1950, was a case-control study comparing lung cancer patients with matched controls. Doll and Hill also started a long-term prospective study of smoking and health. This was an investigation of the smoking habits and health of 40,701 British doctors for several years (British doctors study). Fisher was in profound disagreement with the conclusions and procedures of the smoking/cancer work and from 1957 he criticised the work in the press and in academic publications.|$|E
500|$|The four {{remaining}} contestants {{participate in}} the next round, which involves celebrities (often singers). Then, the final two players will {{move on to the}} [...] "Duel", played as it was during the first series, with the exception that the <b>randomisation</b> of each segment's colours is now shown briefly before being covered; and the game board now consists of 10 segments instead of 8. The competing pair will have to memorise the position of the jumbled up segments, then take it in turns to find their colour. The first to have all five of their colour revealed is the winner and advances to the new final round, [...] "The Vortex".|$|E
500|$|Beyond {{medical ethics}} and bioethics, the {{philosophy}} of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the epistemology and ontology/metaphysics of medicine. Within the epistemology of medicine, evidence-based medicine (EBM) (or evidence-based practice (EBP)) has attracted attention, most notably the roles of <b>randomisation,</b> blinding and placebo controls. Related to these areas of investigation, ontologies of specific interest to {{the philosophy of}} medicine include Cartesian dualism, the monogenetic conception of disease and the conceptualization of 'placebos' and 'placebo effects'. There is also a growing interest in the metaphysics of medicine, particularly the idea of causation. [...] Philosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated, {{but also in the}} nature of such phenomena. Causation is of interest because the purpose of much medical research is to establish causal relationships, e.g. what causes disease, or what causes people to get better.|$|E
2500|$|Findings {{of fraud}} {{associated}} with Scotia trials also weighed on Horrobin's company. Goran Jamal, {{a doctor who}} had participated in developing Efamol, was found guilty of research fraud by the General Medical Council in 2003. The Council ruled that Jamal had committed [...] "serious professional misconduct for falsifying his results", manipulating the supposed <b>randomisation</b> of the clinical trial conducted over a decade earlier. Scotia was faulted by industry observers for what was called a [...] "highly unusual" [...] compensation scheme, as it had offered the doctor a portion of profits from future sales, although the Council suggested that Jamal was prompted to commit fraud by his [...] "belief" [...] in the efficacy of the drug and not by his desire for financial gain.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method to}} avoid this problem, known as blocked <b>randomisation,</b> is to stratify patients according {{to a number of}} factors (e.g. male and female, or smokers and non-smokers) and to use a separate <b>randomisation</b> list for each group. Each <b>randomisation</b> list would be created such that after every block of x patients, there would be an equal number in each treatment group. The problem with this method is that the number of lists increases exponentially with the number of stratification factors.|$|E

50|$|Currently {{pipelines}} {{are available}} for analysis of fMRI activation paradigms, spectral analysis of resting state acquisitions and second-level (between-subject) analysis based on <b>randomisation</b> (permutation) methods.|$|E
50|$|However, trials {{can vary}} greatly in quality. Methodological errors such as poor {{blinding}} or poor <b>randomisation</b> allow {{factors such as}} the placebo effect or selection bias to adversely affect the results of a trial.|$|E
50|$|Additionally the {{epistemological}} virtues of particular aspects of clinical trial methodology have been examined, mostly notably the special {{place that is}} given to <b>randomisation,</b> {{the notion of a}} blind experiment and the use of a placebo control.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} keep the library size within {{reasonable}} limits, this technique is restricted to <b>randomisation</b> of only the key residues involved in base recognition. Furthermore, unlike in parallel selection, this technique requires multiple pannings before a novel ZFP can be constructed.|$|E
50|$|Some online {{prediction}} problems however cannot fit in {{the framework}} of OCO. For example, in online classification, the prediction domain and the loss functions are not convex. In such scenarios, two simple techniques for convexification are used: <b>randomisation</b> and surrogate loss functions.|$|E
50|$|As nonrandomised {{alternatives}} always {{exist to}} randomised Bayes rules, <b>randomisation</b> {{is not needed}} in Bayesian statistics, although frequentist statistical theory sometimes {{requires the use of}} randomised rules to satisfy optimality conditions such as minimax, most notably when deriving confidence intervals and hypothesis tests about discrete probability distributions.|$|E
50|$|The ccTalk {{multidrop}} bus protocol uses an 8 bit TTL-level asynchronous serial protocol. It uses address randomization {{to allow}} multiple similar devices {{on the bus}} (after <b>randomisation</b> the devices can be distinguished by their serial number). ccTalk was developed by CoinControls, but is used by multiple vendors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Randomisation</b> is {{a process}} to remove {{potential}} distortion of statistical results arising from {{the manner in which}} thetrial is conducted, in particular in the selection of subjects. Studies have indicated, for example, that nonrandomised trials are more likely to show a positive result for a new treatment than for an established conventional one.|$|E
50|$|The {{department}} also {{hosts the}} UKCRN accredited King's Clinical Trials Unit which provides <b>randomisation,</b> data management, analysis and trial management - {{all of which}} are available to researchers across King's Health Partners. The CTU provides support to both medicinal and non-medicinal clinical trials assisting researchers in the conduct of carrying out clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|The {{key idea}} behind the Prêt à Voter {{approach}} is to encode the vote using a randomized candidate list. The <b>randomisation</b> of the candidate list on each ballot form ensures the secrecy of each vote. Incidentally, it also removes any bias towards the top candidate that can occur with a fixed ordering.|$|E
5000|$|... "For {{this purpose}} the new test {{proposed}} would be entirely inappropriate, and no experimenter would {{be tempted to}} employ it. Mathematically, however, it is as valid as any other, in that with proper <b>randomisation</b> it is demonstrable that it would give a significant result with known probability, if the null hypothesis were true." ...|$|E
50|$|To {{receive the}} {{corresponding}} point, an article should describe {{the number of}} withdrawals and dropouts, {{in each of the}} study groups, and the underlying reasons.

50|$|For both DLLs and for EXEs which opt into Address Space Layout <b>Randomisation</b> - an exploit {{mitigation}} technique introduced with Windows Vista, relocation tables {{once again}} become mandatory {{because of the}} possibility that the binary may be dynamically moved before being executed, even though they are still the first thing loaded in the virtual address space.|$|E
50|$|Execution in Greenfoot {{consists}} of a built-in main loop that repeatedly invokes each actor's act method. Programming a scenario, therefore, consists mainly of implementing act methods for the scenario's actors. Implementation is done in standard Java. Greenfoot offers API methods {{for a range of}} common tasks, such as animation, sound, <b>randomisation,</b> and image manipulation. All standard Java libraries can be used as well, and sophisticated functionality can be achieved.|$|E
50|$|After 1968, Basu {{began writing}} polemical essays, which {{provided}} paradoxes to frequentist statistics, and which produced great discussion in statistical journals and at statistical meetings. Particularly stimulating papers were Basu's {{papers on the}} foundations of survey sampling. There is an extensive literature discussing Basu's problem of estimating {{the weight of the}} elephants at a circus with an enormous bull elephant named Jumbo, which Basu used to illustrate his objections to the Horvitz-Thompson estimator and to Fisher's <b>randomisation</b> test.|$|E
50|$|Note that no {{situation}} is possible where a nonrandomised Bayes rule {{does not exist}} but a randomised Bayes rule does. The existence of a randomised Bayes rule implies {{the existence of a}} nonrandomised Bayes rule. This is also true in the general case, even with infinite parameter space, infinite Bayes risk, and regardless of whether the infimum Bayes risk can be attained. This supports the intuitive notion that the statistician need not utilise <b>randomisation</b> to arrive at statistical decisions.|$|E
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} contributions are the monograph by Stein (1986), where he presents {{his view of the}} method and the concept of auxiliary <b>randomisation,</b> in particular using exchangeable pairs, and the articles by Barbour (1988) and Götze (1991), who introduced the so-called generator interpretation, which made it possible to easily adapt the method to many other probability distributions. An important contribution was also an article by Bolthausen (1984) on the so-called combinatorial central limit theorem.|$|E
50|$|Mark Six is {{a lottery}} style game where players guess what numbers {{will be drawn}} out of a lottery machine. The lottery machine is a {{transparent}} plastic cylinder which contains coloured Red, Blue and Green balls with numbers 1 to 49. The cylinder is rotated to provide <b>randomisation</b> in the drawing process. Each drawing occurs on 9:30PM (Hong Kong Time) every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday(or Sataurday if horse races occurs on Sunday), while bets are accepted until 15 minutes prior to the drawing.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} the CamBA {{software}} repository begin in 1996 at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, London, UK. Professor Edward Bullmore and Professor Mick Brammer wrote a small package of software components to process {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} data, which at that time was an emerging technology. In 1999 Dr John Suckling became involved in the first effort to coordinate and organise the software including options for processing structural MRI images and between-subject statistical inference, based on <b>randomisation</b> methods.|$|E
50|$|On 4th August 2016 {{a second}} edition of Mansions of Madness was released. Aside from some minor modifications, {{gameplay}} was fundamentally {{the same as}} in the first edition but with the role of the keeper replaced by a companion app that would run on PC, iOS, or Android platforms. This app expanded the gameplay in several ways including the <b>randomisation</b> of maps and monsters and incorporating and extended range of interactive puzzles into the app. It also meant that the game could be played solo.|$|E
5000|$|His main {{interests}} {{were in the}} heart and kidney. His work on the involvement of calcium in the action of digitalis was prescient. He wasa interested in optical isomers. Data from an early clinical trial using hyoscine isomers was used by William Sealy Gossett who, under the pseudonym [...] "Student" [...] published in 1908 the first small-sample test of significance, Student's t test. His use of these data {{has given rise to}} much discussion. Later reanalysis of the same data by a <b>randomisation</b> tests gave a similar result.|$|E
5000|$|Motivation: Motivation of {{panel members}} affects their sensory acuity. It is {{therefore}} important {{to maintain the}} interest of the panellists. This can be achieved just by conducting the experiment in a professional, controlled manner, or even by offering a report of their results. Usually 1 ‘trained panellists are more motivated than those who are not.’ There are many other errors which can occur but the above are the main possible errors. It is evident from the above information that <b>randomisation,</b> control and professional conduct of the experiment are essential for obtaining the most accurate results.|$|E
