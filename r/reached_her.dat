5|$|At {{this point}} in her career, Sörenstam says she lost focus having <b>reached</b> <b>her</b> biggest goals. Karrie Webb became the best LPGA Tour player but Sörenstam still managed to win more LPGA tournaments than any other LPGA Tour player during the 1990s. She {{qualified}} for the World Golf Hall of Fame when she won the 2000 Welch's/Circle K Championship, but was not eligible for induction until finishing her tenth year on the LPGA tour in October 2003.

40|$|Abstract. We {{set up a}} {{two-stage}} {{game with}} sequential moves by one altruistic agent and n selfish agents. The rotten kid theorem states that the altruist can only <b>reach</b> <b>her</b> first best when the selfish agents move before the altruist. The Samaritan’s dilemma, on the other hand, states that the altruist can only <b>reach</b> <b>her</b> first best when she moves before the selfish agents. We find that in general, the altruist can <b>reach</b> <b>her</b> first best when she moves first, {{if and only if}} a selfish agent’s action marginally only affects his own payoff. The altruist can <b>reach</b> <b>her</b> first best when she moves last if and only if a selfish agent cannot manipulate the price of his payoff. When the altruist cannot <b>reach</b> <b>her</b> first best when she moves last, the outcome is not Pareto efficient either. JEL Classification: D 6...|$|R

5|$|Before Selena {{signed a}} {{recording}} contract in 1989 with EMI Latin, she had hinted {{that she wanted}} to start recording in English. She was asked to make three demonstration recordings for Charles Koppelman, chairman of EMI Records. After reviewing them, Koppelman declined a crossover attempt, believing that Selena should first strengthen her fan base. Later, after releasing five Spanish-language albums that all achieved unprecedented milestones in the Latin music industry, Koppelman considered that Selena had <b>reached</b> <b>her</b> peak in the Spanish market, and he began preparations for a crossover album.|$|E
5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris had <b>reached</b> <b>her</b> furthest {{north of}} 82°29'N. Tension flared {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} could not agree on whether to proceed further or not. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance {{they would have to}} travel to the Pole by dogsled. Budington did not want to further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion. In the end, they sailed into Thank God Harbor (now called Hall Bay) on Sept. 10, 1871, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland.|$|E

She was originally intended to lay mines but the plan was later cancelled.|$|E

Either Nagara or the destroyers Teruzuki and Yukikaze {{came upon the}} {{drifting}} Cushing and pounded her with gunfire, knocking out all of her systems. Unable to fight back, Cushings crew abandoned ship. Cushing sank several hours later.

5|$|After Christmas, Neuner won both {{individual}} races in Oberhof – her World Cup wins 27 and 28. In the women’s relay, she incurred 4 penalties {{in the final}} shooting, which foiled a likely German victory. Neuner suffered {{one of the biggest}} mishaps of her career, when she fired on the wrong targets in the Nove Mesto pursuit, dropping from first to seventh place. She recovered quickly by winning the sprint race in Antholz one week later. In February, Neuner claimed a double sprint and pursuit victory in Oslo despite suffering from a cold, which forced her to withdraw from the mass start. At the last World Cup stop before the world championships in Kontiolahti, she <b>reached</b> <b>her</b> sixth sprint win of the season, and extended her World Cup lead over Darya Domracheva.|$|E

Resuming her patrol after a day's delay, U-41 <b>reached</b> <b>her</b> patrol area east of Malta. Wolf and U-41 scored their first success on 13 September, when they torpedoed and sank the steamer Amiral Charner west of Pantellaria. The 4,604-ton French ship was carrying horses and a general cargo from Marseilles for Salonika when she was attacked. Six {{were killed in the}} attack on the French ship. On 26 September, U-41 attacked another steamer west of Kefalonia, but was apparently unsuccessful. U-41 ended her patrol at Cattaro on 28 September.|$|E

5|$|After the Texas Revolution ended, the {{original}} {{draft of the}} letter was given to Travis's family in Alabama. Several prominent Texians {{are known to have}} visited Travis's estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended, but historians are unsure which of these men might have delivered the letter. Travis's daughter Susan (aged five {{at the time of his}} death) passed the letter down to her descendants; it eventually <b>reached</b> <b>her</b> great-grandson, John G. Davidson. In February 1891, Davidson lent the letter to the Texas Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History. Two years later, Davidson offered to sell the letter to the state of Texas for $250 ($ today). This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts, and the state was hesitant to agree. After negotiations, Davidson agreed to accept $85 ($ today) for the letter, and on May 29 it officially passed into state ownership.|$|E
5|$|At the BNP Paribas Open, Svetlana was seeded 16th and {{received}} a bye into the second round. However, she suffered a loss to Coco Vandeweghe.

The last time Kuznetsova defeated a world No. 1 player was at the 2009 Roland Garros final. She also stopped the American's 20-match winning streak.

5|$|Buchanan next turned Virginia on Congress. Seeing {{what had}} {{happened}} to Cumberland, Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith, captain of Congress, ordered his ship grounded in shallow water. By this time, the James River Squadron, commanded by John Randolph Tucker, had arrived and joined Virginia in the attack on Congress. After an hour of unequal combat, the badly damaged Congress surrendered. While the surviving crewmen of Congress were being ferried off the ship, a Union battery on the north shore opened fire on Virginia. In retaliation, Buchanan ordered Congress fired upon with hot shot, cannonballs heated red-hot. Congress caught fire and burned {{throughout the rest of the}} day. Near midnight, the flames <b>reached</b> <b>her</b> magazine and she exploded and sank, stern first. Personnel losses included 110 killed or missing and presumed drowned. Another 26 were wounded, of whom ten died within days.|$|E
