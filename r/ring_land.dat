50|$|Finally, in 1993 Ford made {{available}} a turbocharged {{edition of the}} 7.3L. An internally wastegated, AR.82 Garrett T3 series turbo {{was used as the}} OEM for the factory turbocharger system. The system was tuned to minimize performance loss at high elevation, rather than to improve peak performance. A primary limiting factor to the performance potential of the engine is an incredibly restrictive stock down-pipe. It is commonly believed, but not officially verified, that this is deliberate and due to Ford's impending release of the T444E (Powerstroke) engine. Factory turbo vehicles received numerous additional improvements. Pistons had an enlarged primary compression ring, added intermediate ring, an enlarged <b>ring</b> <b>land</b> and wrist pin, as well as an anodized piston face. Other improvements included tweaks to the injection pump, and an upgraded oil-coolant heat exchanger.|$|E
50|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{can actually}} be used to some slight advantage. If a compression test does give a low figure, {{and it has been}} determined it is not due to intake valve closure/camshaft characteristics, then one can differentiate between the cause being valve/seat seal issues and ring seal by squirting engine oil into the spark plug orifice, in a quantity sufficient to disperse across the piston crown and the circumference of the top <b>ring</b> <b>land,</b> and thereby affect the mentioned seal. If a second compression test is performed shortly thereafter, and the new reading is much higher, it would be the ring seal that is problematic, whereas if the compression test pressure observed remains low, it is a valve sealing (or more rarely head gasket, or breakthrough piston or, rarer still, cylinder-wall damage) issue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To assess piston’s thermal loads, {{the direct}} and {{effective}} method is to calculate piston’s temperature distribution. A key point in calculating the temperature field of a piston is the determination of heat transfer boundary conditions of each side, especially the gas side. The thermal boundaries of a piston consist of the piston top side (combustion side), the crevice surfaces, the piston <b>ring</b> <b>land</b> and skirt outside surface, piston underside and pin hole side. The calculating methods for the heat transfer boundary conditions of engine piston are studied according to the theoretical analysis of heat transfer of engine piston, which can {{be taken as a}} reference for providing precise boundary conditions for the research on piston’s temperature field...|$|E
40|$|Practical {{challenges}} from both experiment and calculation sides were discussed for determining two piece twin land {{oil control ring}} friction. A floating liner engine was used for twin land oil control ring study. Effects of floating liner engine system dynamics and piston skirt friction were addressed and methods to mitigate them were discussed. A deterministic twin land oil control ring model was used for ring friction calculation. Variation of the surface roughness at different spots of the liner {{and its effects on}} both hydrodynamic and boundary lubrication predictions were discussed. A multi-point correlation method was introduced to address surface variation effects on the twin land oil control ring model. <b>Ring</b> <b>land</b> width variation between two lands as well as along the circumference and its effects on calculation were shown, and methods to address it were discussed. By taking all these necessary steps in both experiments and calculations, this study shows that a reasonable match can be achieved between the measured and calculated friction, which covers all three lubrication regimes. This study lays a foundation for realistically predicting the friction of piston rings in internal com-bustion engines...|$|E
40|$|Cylinder liner {{surfaces}} are {{often on the}} agenda of engine developers because of their large influence on the frictional losses, oil consumption and emissions of internal combustion engines. Improving the liner function involves not only manufacturing new surfaces and checking their function but also characterising them as a necessary intermediate step for better understanding of the changes made. In the manufacturing of the liners, honing is a well adapted and widely used finishing process and along with the characterisation and function {{has been the subject of}} studies in this thesis. Regarding the liner’s function, three phenomena were monitored: wear, friction and oil passage rate (correlated with engine’s oil consumption). The first one was studied experimentally while the other two were simulated. Only the interactions with the twin land oil control ring were simulated as it has the greatest influence on the control of friction and oil consumption of all other rings. In the mid-stroke region of truck engine liners, the presence of axial wear scratches was observed and their relation with the removal of the cold worked material (“Blechmantel”) folded inside the deep honing grooves was investigated. Algorithms were developed for estimating the extent of Blechmantel, revealing that most of it remained on the surface whereas the engines still performed well. Other algorithms for characterising honing angle, balance of honing texture, width, height, distance between honing grooves/axial wear scratches, etc were developed for quicker and more objective inspection of unworn and worn surfaces from 3 D interference measurements. Based on such 3 D measurements, the algorithms were incorporated in a characterisation tool enabling rating of the surfaces and determining the number of measurements necessary to achieve stable roughness parameter values. In addition, it was found that interference measurements are more suitable for quantification of the deposits on the worn truck liner surfaces compared with scanning electron microscope measurements. The lubrication and friction of flat oil control ring lands and differently slide honed surfaces of truck liners were simulated. Friction mean effective pressure and oil passage rate were calculated for each surface showing in each case a reduction for the surfaces with smoother plateaus and smaller valleys. Such a liner surface was finished by using a low base honing pressure and a longer plateau honing time. In a car engine, the influence of different liner surfaces, <b>ring</b> <b>land</b> widths and tensions was examined by running simulations. The results suggest that a considerably improved function can be achieved if the <b>ring</b> <b>land</b> width and tension are reduced whereby the differences between the liner surfaces would reduce...|$|E

40|$|The {{piston ring}} pack {{friction}} {{is a major}} contributor to the internal combustion engine mechanical friction loss. The oil control ring decides the oil supply to the top two rings in addition to being the major friction contributor in the ring pack. This work concentrated on the oil control ring friction. A large range of <b>ring</b> <b>land</b> widths and tensions, liner finish, and oil viscosity were investigated both experimentally and numerically to reveal how different factors affect the piston ring friction. A floating liner engine (FLE) was modified for motoring tests. The engine system repeatability and self-consistency were demonstrated. The thesis then discussed proper methods to select and measure the rings, liners and oil, which were important to generating meaningful results from the experiment. The ranges of engine speeds and liner temperatures were designed to ensure that all the lubrication modes, namely, boundary, mixed and hydrodynamic, can become dominant in both the instantaneous friction over a cycle and the FMEP over the engine speed range for any combination of rings, liners and lubricants. A parallel modeling effort was made to the experiments. The work showed that with careful preparation of adequate information on rings, liners and lubricants, the model can match the friction trends observed in the experiment over a large range of operating parameters and designs on the ring, liner finish and lubricant viscosity. The ring friction change over the liner break-in was studied using liners covering a wide range of surface roughness. The hydrodynamic pressure generation ability of the liner appears to be decided by the large surface structure. Therefore, the break-in process, which removes individual asperities from the plateau, does not affect pure hydrodynamic lubrication, and only the mixed lubrication is affected by the plateau roughness change. By keeping the same hydrodynamic pressure - ring/liner clearance (P-h) correlation and changing the plateau roughness, the model can predict the ring friction change over different lubrication regimes during the break-in. Compared to the current industry norm, a new engine power cylinder system design using a smaller land width twin land oil control ring with a lower ring tension and accompanied by a smoother liner surface gives lower friction and better oil control at the same time. by Kai Liao.
