30|$|Au@Ag NPs were {{prepared}} according to previously described method {{with a little}} modification [27]. Simply, as-prepared Au NPs (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0  mL) were added to each of five 50  mL <b>round-bottomed</b> <b>flasks</b> containing 10  mL of water, respectively.

50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{shown in}} the diagram represents a batch distillation {{as opposed to a}} continuous distillation. The liquid feed mixture to be distilled is placed into the <b>round-bottomed</b> <b>flask</b> along with a few anti-bumping granules, and the fractionating column is fitted into the top. As the mixture is heated and boils, vapor rises up the column. The vapor condenses on the glass platforms (known as plates or trays) inside the column and runs back down into the liquid below, thereby refluxing the upflowing distillate vapor. The hottest tray is {{at the bottom of the}} column and the coolest tray is at the top. At steady state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray is at equilibrium. Only the most volatile of the vapors stays in gaseous form all the way to the top. The vapor at the top of the column then passes into the condenser, where it cools until it condenses into a liquid. The separation can be enhanced with the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.). The process continues until all the most volatile components in the liquid feed boil out of the mixture. This point can be recognized by the rise in temperature shown on the thermometer. For continuous distillation, the feed mixture enters in the middle of the column.|$|E

30|$|For the {{formation}} of noncross-linked and cross-linked PNIPAAm shells on Au NWs, the above Au NWs at initiator solution (8 mL) was equally divided into two separate <b>round-bottomed</b> <b>flasks</b> (labelled with I and II).

30|$|The aqueous silk {{solutions}} {{to be used}} for electrospinning were prepared by the following procedure. Firstly, degumming was achieved by cutting Bombyx mori cocoons into suitable pieces and were boiled in 0.02  M Na 2 CO 3 for an hour and subsequently washed with de-ionized water (2 to 3 times) to remove the unbound sericin. Later on, the samples were dried at room temperature for 1  day. After drying, 60  g of degummed silk was dissolved in ternary solvent composed of CaCl 2 /Ethanol/H 2 O (32 / 26 / 42, wt/wt/wt) at 98 °C for 40  min in <b>round-bottomed</b> <b>flasks.</b> Following this, protein mixture was filtered through miracloth (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) to remove small aggregates.

The yielding aqueous silk fibroin solution was calculated to be 8  wt.% (which was determined by weighing the remaining solid weight after drying). Finally, the aqueous silk fibroin solutions were stored in a refrigerator and used within 15  days of time to avoid denaturation and/or precipitation.|$|R
40|$|Water-soluble, {{branched}} dimethylacrylamide copolymers {{have been}} prepared via facile, one-step, batch solution free-radical polymerisations taken to high conversion. N,N-dimethylacrylamide has been copolymerised with different branching agents (ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, EGDMA and PEG dimethacrylates) using dodecanethiol (DDT) as a chain transfer agent to inhibit gelation. Good yields of soluble branched copolymers have been produced by carrying out individual reactions in conventional glass <b>round-bottomed</b> <b>flasks</b> and also parallel reactions in a Radley's Carousel Reactor. The products have been characterised by size exclusion chromatography and 1 H NMR and FT-IR spectroscopies and interestingly though the trends in copolymer structure are similar for products prepared in the conventional glassware {{and those in the}} parallel reactor, some systematic differences arise between the two sets of products. This seems to be {{due in part to the}} slightly different scale of these reactions, and possibly also to the better sealing of the parallel reactor tubes and hence better exclusion of traces of O 2. Branching seems to occur more uniformly with DAM than with the previously studied methyl methacrylate (all other parameters being identical), though the effects of the chain transfer agent, monomer concentration, monomer/chain transfer agent feed ratio and the chain length of the branching agent are similar for both monomers. Also the EGDMA/DDT ratio is at least as important in controlling branching as the absolute amount of EGDMA and DDT incorporated. Highly branched products can therefore be made with relatively low levels of EGDMA and DDT as long as the EGDMA/DDT ratio is high enough, but not so high as to favour cross-linking...|$|R
