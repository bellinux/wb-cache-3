40|$|With the {{objective}} of minimizing the total execution time of a parallel program on a distributed memory parallel computer, this paper discusses how to find an optimal supernode size and optimal supernode <b>relative</b> <b>side</b> lengths of a supernode transformation (also known as tiling). We identify three parameters of supernode transformation: supernode size, <b>relative</b> <b>side</b> lengths, and cutting hyperplane directions. For algorithms with perfectly nested loops and uniform dependencies, for sufficiently large supernodes and number of processors, and for the case where multiple supernodes are mapped to a single processor, we give an order n polynomial whose real positive roots include the optimal supernode size. For two special cases: (1) two dimensional algorithm problems and (2) n-dimensional algorithm problems where the communication cost {{is dominated by the}} startup penalty and therefore, can be approximated by a constant, we give a closed form expression for the optimal supernode s [...] ...|$|R
