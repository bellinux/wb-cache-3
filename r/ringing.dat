5|$|The Octagon is also {{believed}} {{by some to}} be haunted by the spirits of African American slaves who once lived there. When the house held bells to summon servants, the spirits of the dead slaves would announce their presence by <b>ringing</b> these bells loudly. The ghostly bell <b>ringing</b> first occurred in the 1870s. General George D. Ramsay, Chief of Ordnance for the United States Army and commander of the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C., was attending a dinner at The Octagon when all the bells in the house began <b>ringing.</b> As Marian Gouverneur, wife of Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (the first American consul in Foo Chow, China), related the story, General Ramsay seized the bell ropes to stop the bells from sounding, but to everyone's shock they did not stop <b>ringing.</b> Although Gouverneur's report was not made until 1911, the mysterious <b>ringing</b> of the bells had been reported in 1874 and again in 1889, each time attributed to the spirits of dead slaves.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We in {{this note}} {{consider}} a new concept, so called pi-McCoy, which unifies McCoy <b>rings</b> and IFP <b>rings.</b> The classes of McCoy <b>rings</b> and IFP <b>rings</b> {{do not contain}} full matrix <b>rings</b> and upper (lower) triangular matrix <b>rings,</b> but the class of pi-McCoy <b>rings</b> contain upper (lower) trian-gular matrix <b>rings</b> and many kinds of full matrix <b>rings.</b> We first study {{the basic structure of}} pi-McCoy <b>rings,</b> observing the relations among pi-McCoy <b>rings,</b> Abelian <b>rings,</b> 2 -primal <b>rings,</b> directly finite <b>rings,</b> and (pi-) regular <b>rings.</b> It is proved that the n by n full matrix <b>rings</b> (n ≥ 2) over reduced <b>rings</b> are not pi-McCoy, finding pi-McCoy matrix <b>rings</b> over non-reduced <b>rings.</b> It is shown that the pi-McCoyness is preserved by polynomial <b>rings</b> (when they are of bounded index of nilpotency) and classical quotient <b>rings.</b> Several kinds of extensions of pi-McCoy <b>rings</b> are also examined. 1.

5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for <b>ringing,</b> it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird <b>ringing</b> is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E

Also, for semiperfect <b>rings</b> such as serial <b>rings,</b> the basic <b>ring</b> is Morita equivalent to the original <b>ring.</b> Thus if R is a serial <b>ring</b> with basic <b>ring</b> B, {{and the structure of}} B is known, the theory of Morita equivalence gives that [...] where P is some finitely generated progenerator B.
