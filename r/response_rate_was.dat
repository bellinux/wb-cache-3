2500|$|Treatment {{of panic}} {{disorder}} with sertraline {{results in a}} decrease {{of the number of}} panic attacks and an improved quality of life. In four double-blind studies sertraline was shown to be superior to placebo for the treatment of panic disorder. The <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>was</b> independent of the dose. In addition to decreasing the frequency of panic attacks by about 80% (vs. 45% for placebo) and decreasing general anxiety, sertraline resulted in improvement of quality of life on most parameters. The patients rated as [...] "improved" [...] on sertraline reported better quality of life than the ones who [...] "improved" [...] on placebo. The authors of the study argued that the improvement achieved with sertraline is different and of a better quality than the improvement achieved with placebo. Sertraline was equally effective for men and women. While imprecise, comparison of the results of trials of sertraline with separate trials of other anti-panic agents (clomipramine, imipramine, clonazepam, alprazolam, fluvoxamine and paroxetine) indicates approximate equivalence of these medications.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Response</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> used by {{analysts to}} assess survey quality: higher <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> usually desired {{to reduce the}} {{incidence}} of non-response bias. The <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> simply defined as the ratio of the number of completed interviews divided by the number of eligible sample units. However, due to the inconsistency of the definition of <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> often quoted in travel surveys, it is difficult to explicitly state that declining <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> the result of less people willing to participate in surveys or are attributed to the calculation of <b>response</b> <b>rates.</b> It <b>is</b> most likely to be a combination of these two factors.
