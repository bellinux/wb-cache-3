According to Perry and Wise, whose theories contributed {{to the understanding of}} the ongoing relationship between one's overall motivation and the public interest, provided the widely accepted definition of PSM as an individual’s [...] "predisposition to respond to motives grounded primarily or uniquely in public institutions and organizations." [...] Under this definition, organizations have the duty and responsibility to foster an environment that allows employees to feel as if they are able to contribute to the general welfare of the public and can achieve their goals. Various scholars and researchers emphasize the role of organizations as an important aspect of PSM and indicate several factors that face employees on a regular basis that could either promote or hinder PSM. Perry and Wise specify those factors of an organization that influence PSM to include culture within an organization which can negatively be associated with PSM as hierarchical cultures tend to emphasize <b>rule-based</b> <b>control</b> of employees and bureaucratic personality, employees that experience red tape who often are characterized with lower levels of PSM as red tape includes rules regulations, and procedures that remain in force and entail a compliance burden, but do not advance the legitimate purposes the rules were intended to serve. Employees who had a lower level of job satisfaction were reported as more willing to tolerate red tape as opposed to those employees characterized with higher levels of PSM who were frustrated with the limitations of such constrictions. Educational level of organizational members reportedly had a positive relationship on the overall level of PSM of the individual. Wright, Pandey, and Moynihan emphasize that it is vital that organizational leaders understand the various factors that affect PSM in order help employees achieve their goals within the organization and provide for a better work environment.|$|E

This paper studies cost-optimal and <b>rule-based</b> <b>control</b> for buildings with PV, employing a heat pump, thermal and electrical storage and shiftable loads as flexibility sources {{to increase the}} value of PV for the prosumer. The cost-optimal control minimizes variable electricity cost employing market data on electricity price and optionally constrains grid feed-in to zero; the <b>rule-based</b> <b>control</b> aims at maximizing PV self-consumption. The flexibility strategies are combined into a simulation model to analyze different system configurations over a full year. The applicability of the new model is demonstrated with a case study with empirical data from a real low-energy house in Southern Finland. Compared to inflexible reference control with a constant price for bought electricity, cost-optimal control employing hourly market price of electricity achieved 13 - 25 % savings in theyearly electricity bill. Moreover, 8 - 88 % decrease in electricity fed into the grid was obtained. The exact values depend on PV capacity and the flexibility options chosen. Limiting grid feed-in to zero led to less energy efficient control. The most effective flexibility measures in this case {{turned out to be}} thermal storage with a heat pump and a battery, whereas shiftable appliances showed only a marginal effect.

The hour-by-hour state of the smart windows required to minimize overall energy consumption while respecting constraints related to thermal and visual comfort is determined through an optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms (GA).
