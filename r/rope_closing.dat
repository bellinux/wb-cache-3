40|$|A {{magnetic}} flux rope model is developed {{and used to}} determine whether the principal axis analysis (PAA) of magnetometer signatures from a single satellite pass is sufficient to obtain the magnetic topology of plasmoids. The model is also used to determine if plasmoid observations are best explained by the flux <b>rope,</b> <b>closed</b> loop, or large-amplitude wave picture. It was found that the principal axis directions is highly dependent on the satellite trajectory through the structure and, therefore, the PAA of magnetometer data from a single satellite pass is insufficient to differentiate between magnetic closed loop and flux rope models. Results also indicate that the flux rope model of plasmoid formation is well suited to unify the observations of various magnetic structures observed by ISEE 3...|$|R
5000|$|Dallow Lane, {{also known}} as the Excelsior Ground, had a {{capacity}} of about 7,000 - most spectators would simply stand behind a <b>rope</b> <b>close</b> to the pitch, and there was a seated grandstand constructed in 1894. The stand was [...] "120 feet long, 18 feet high, 13 feet deep and had five tiers of seats". Due to Dallow Lane's close proximity to the Luton to Dunstable railway line, players claimed to have trouble playing due to smoke from the engines. The club made a damaging financial loss during 1896-97 and was forced to sell the ground to stay afloat. Luton Town left Dallow Lane in April to play at Dunstable Road. The Dallow Lane grandstand remained on the site until the mid-20th century, used as a store shed.|$|R

Just then a man was seen to run out on the main-yard, and slip down by a <b>rope</b> <b>close</b> to the sea. The boat sheered up towards him, and several arms were stretched out to save; but the boat glided away and the succeeding wave engulfed him. Only for a second however.

He dropped into the sea close alongside, caught one of the life-lines, and next instant was in the boat.|$|R

Then he sat up himself. Confident as he felt in the canoe, he was almost frightened at the wild aspect of the sea. The wind was literally howling, driving the rain before it with a force that stung Godfrey's neck as it struck it. He got out a strip of deer-skin lashing, of which there was a supply always close at hand under the deck, lashed the paddles together, and then, leaning aft, lashed them at the centre firmly to the tow-rope. Then with some difficulty he got out his knife and cut the <b>rope</b> <b>close</b> to its fastening; the paddles flew overboard, and the boat drifted rapidly astern, the drag of the paddles being, as Godfrey observed with satisfaction, sufficient to keep her head to wind. Then he wriggled himself down underneath the apron again and lashed down {{the cover of the}} hole.|$|R

50|$|For {{the case}} of the horizon around a black hole, {{observers}} stationary with respect to a distant object will all agree on where the horizon is. While this seems to allow an observer lowered towards the hole on a rope (or rod) to contact the horizon, in practice this cannot be done. The proper distance to the horizon is finite, so the length of rope needed would be finite as well, but if the rope were lowered slowly (so that each point on the rope was approximately at rest in Schwarzschild coordinates), the proper acceleration (G-force) experienced by points on the <b>rope</b> <b>closer</b> and closer to the horizon would approach infinity, so the rope would be torn apart. If the rope is lowered quickly (perhaps even in freefall), then indeed the observer {{at the bottom of the}} rope can touch and even cross the event horizon. But once this happens it is impossible to pull the bottom of rope back out of the event horizon, since if the rope is pulled taut, the forces along the rope increase without bound as they approach the event horizon and at some point the rope must break. Furthermore, the break must occur not at the event horizon, but at a point where the second observer can observe it.|$|R

40|$|Rapid, {{irreversible}} {{changes of}} magnetic topology and sunspot structure associated with flares have been systematically observed in recent years. The most striking features include {{the increase of}} horizontal field at the polarity inversion line (PIL) and the co-spatial penumbral darkening. A likely explanation of the above phenomenon is the back reaction to the coronal restructuring after eruptions: a coronal mass ejection carries the upward momentum while the downward momentum compresses the field lines near the PIL. Previous studies could only use low resolution (above 1 ") magnetograms and white-light images. Therefore, the changes are mostly observed for X-class flares. Taking advantage of the 0. 1 " spatial resolution and 15 s temporal cadence of the New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory, we report in detail the rapid formation of sunspot penumbra at the PIL associated with the C 7. 4 flare on 2012 July 2. It is unambiguously shown that the solar granulation pattern evolves to alternating dark and bright fibril structure, the typical pattern of penumbra. Interestingly, the appearance of such a penumbra creates a new delta sunspot. The penumbral formation is also accompanied by the enhancement of horizontal field observed using vector magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. We explain our observations as due to the eruption of a flux rope following magnetic cancellation at the PIL. Subsequently the re-closed arcade fields are pushed down towards the surface to form the new penumbra. NLFFF extrapolation clearly shows both the flux <b>rope</b> <b>close</b> {{to the surface and}} the overlying fields...|$|R
50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, angle cut side cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope ring discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the <b>closing</b> <b>rope(s)</b> to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two <b>rope</b> design. The <b>closing</b> force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each <b>closing</b> <b>rope</b> in the two girders. The <b>closing</b> <b>rope</b> is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and <b>closing</b> <b>ropes</b> require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on chain pulleys are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|R

I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and he soon made his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope's end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: This work {{covers the}} design, {{realization}} and validation of an autonomous load transportation system, utilizing several small size helicopters. The number of participating helicopters is configurable for the described system, {{depending on the}} requirements of the transported load. The presented models and controllers have been validated in computer simulation and flight experiments. Two non-linear models are presented: One model covers single-lift and one model covers dual- and multi-lift configurations. Simplified models are introduced beside the complex models, which are utilized for the translation controller design. A generic orientation controller is presented, which is applicable for the control of all presented slung load configurations. The utilization of this controller significantly simplifies the design of the translation controllers. The independence from the actual slung load configuration is achieved through measurement of the rope force vector in the rope attachment point, which is located on the helicopter fuselage. Three translation controllers are described: A controller for single-lift configurations, which allows the active compensation of load oscillations and a distributed controller for multi-lift configurations. A dual-lift translation controller is presented, which resembles a combination of single- and multi-lift translation controller. The presented controllers for dual- or multi-lift configurations do not utilize auxiliary constructs, like spreader-bars. The position of the load is estimated from the measured orientation of the <b>rope,</b> <b>close</b> to the helicopter fuselage. External disturbances, like wind gusts, are able to stimulate internal oscillations of the rope, which disturb the estimated load position. The internal motion of the rope as well as the influence of the used measurement device are analyzed and a flexible rope model is presented. Based on the results a load motion observer is developed and validated in several experiments. This load motion observer is essential for the safe operation of the slung load system, especially during bad weather conditions. The derived non-linear models of the system as well as the proposed controllers for single- and multi-lift configurations have been validated in flight experiments. The system has been proven to be operable even in presence of adverse weather conditions...|$|R

40|$|A solar eruptive event SOL 2010 - 06 - 13 {{observed}} with SDO/AIA {{has been discussed}} in the contexts of the CME gebesis and an associated EUV transient {{in terms of a}} shock driven by the apparent CME rim. We have revealed in this event an erupting flux rope, studied its properties, and detected wave signatures inside the developing CME. These findings have allowed us to establish new features in the genesis of the CME and associated EUV wave and to reconcile all of the episodes into a causally-related sequence. (1) A hot 11 MK flux rope developed from a compact filament, accelerated up to 3 km/s$^ 2 $ 1 min before a hard X-ray burst and earlier than other structures, reached 420 km/s, and decelerated to 50 km/s. (2) The CME development was driven by the flux <b>rope.</b> <b>Closed</b> structures above the rope got sequentially involved in the expansion from below upwards, came closer together, and disappeared to reveal their envelope, the rim, which became the outer boundary of the cavity. The rim was associated with the separatrix surface of a magnetic domain, which contained the pre-eruptive filament. (3) The rim formation was associated with a successive compression of the upper active-region structures into the CME frontal structure (FS). When the rim was formed, it resembled a piston. (4) The disturbance responsible for the CME formation was excited by the flux rope inside the rim, and then propagated outward. EUV structures at different heights started to accelerate, when their trajectories in the distance-time diagram were crossed by the front of this disturbance. (5) Outside the rim and FS, the disturbance propagated like a blast wave, manifesting in a type II radio burst and a leading part of the EUV transient. Its main, trailing part was the FS, which consisted of swept-up 2 MK loops enveloping the rim. The wave decelerated and decayed soon, being not driven by the trailing piston, which slowed down.
