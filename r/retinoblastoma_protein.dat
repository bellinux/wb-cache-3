25|$|A tumor {{suppressor}} gene, or anti-oncogene, is a {{gene that}} protects a cell from one step {{on the path to}} cancer. When this gene is mutated to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic changes. In 1986, Robert Weinberg and a team of researchers working under his direction made a seminal discovery when they isolated Rb, or the <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>protein,</b> the first known growth-suppressor gene.|$|E
25|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} {{may play}} a role in mammalian hair cell regeneration. By modulating <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>protein</b> activity in rat cochlea, sonic hedgehog allows mature hair cells that normally cannot return to a proliferative state to divide and differentiate. Retinoblastoma proteins suppress cell growth by preventing cells from returning to the cell cycle, thereby preventing proliferation. Inhibiting the activity of Rb seems to allow cells to divide. Therefore, sonic hedgehog, identified as an important regulator of Rb, may also prove to be an important feature in regrowing hair cells after damage.|$|E
25|$|Development {{of cancer}} often {{involves}} multiple alterations of the cellular genome (Knudson hypothesis). Human retinoblastoma {{is a well}} studied example of a cancer type where mitotic nondisjunction can contribute to malignant transformation: Mutations of the RB1 gene, which is located on chromosome 13 and encodes the tumor suppressor <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>protein,</b> can be detected by cytogenetic analysis in many cases of retinoblastoma. Mutations of the RB1 locus in one copy of chromosome 13 are sometimes accompanied by loss of the other wild-type chromosome 13 through mitotic nondisjunction. By this combination of lesions, affected cells completely lose expression of functioning tumor suppressor protein.|$|E

The retinoblastoma gene product was localized to the nuclei and nucleoli of keratinocytes, and to the nuclei of basal and spinous layer cells of normal human epidermis.

In unirradiated and ultraviolet-irradiated keratinocytes <b>retinoblastoma</b> tumor suppressor <b>protein</b> was localized to the spindles of M-phase cells. In contrast, the exposure of keratinocytes to ultraviolet in the presence of 5 [*]mM okadaic acid, resulted in an inhibition of <b>retinoblastoma</b> tumor suppressor <b>protein</b> translocation to the mitotic spindles of M-phase keratinocytes. In addition, the ultraviolet radiation-induced depletion in hyperphosphorylated <b>retinoblastoma</b> tumor suppressor <b>protein,</b> and accumulation of hypophosphorylated <b>retinoblastoma</b> tumor suppressor <b>protein</b> 105 was inhibited by 5 [*]mM okadaic acid. Okadaic acid (0. 5 [*]nM), however, did not affect the ultraviolet radiation-induced dephosphorylation and depletion of hyperphosphorylation of the <b>retinoblastoma</b> tumor suppressor <b>protein.</b> Western blot analysis of ultraviolet-irradiated keratinocytes demonstrated that the hypophosphorylated growth inhibitory 105 [*]kDa form of <b>retinoblastoma</b> tumor suppressor <b>protein</b> coimmunoprecipitated with the 38 [*]kDa catalytic subunit of a type 1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase...|$|R

500|$|Deficiencies in {{homologous}} recombination have been strongly linked to cancer formation in humans. For example, {{each of the}} cancer-related diseases Bloom's syndrome, Werner's syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome are caused by malfunctioning copies of RecQ helicase genes involved in the regulation of {{homologous recombination}}: BLM, WRN and RECQL4, respectively. [...] In the cells of Bloom's syndrome patients, who lack a working copy of the BLM protein, there is an elevated rate of homologous recombination. Experiments in mice deficient in BLM {{have suggested that the}} mutation gives rise to cancer through a loss of heterozygosity caused by increased homologous recombination. [...] A loss in heterozygosity refers to the loss of one of two versions—or alleles—of a gene. [...] If one of the lost alleles helps to suppress tumors, like the gene for the <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>protein</b> for example, then the loss of heterozygosity can lead to cancer.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>protein</b> (protein name {{abbreviated}} pRb; gene name abbreviated RB or RB1) is a tumor suppressor {{protein that}} is dysfunctional in several major cancers. One function of pRb {{is to prevent}} excessive cell growth by inhibiting cell cycle progression until a cell is ready to divide. When the cell is ready to divide, pRb is phosphorylated, becomes inactive and allows cell cycle progression. [...] It is also a recruiter of several chromatin remodeling enzymes such as methylases and acetylases.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>protein</b> is {{involved}} in the growth and development of mammalian hair cells of the cochlea, and appears {{to be related to the}} cells' inability to regenerate. Embryonic hair cells require Rb, among other important proteins, to exit the cell-cycle and stop dividing, which allows maturation of the auditory system. Once wild-type mammals have reached adulthood, their cochlear hair cells become incapable of proliferation. In studies where the gene for Rb is deleted in mice cochlea, hair cells continue to proliferate in early adulthood. Though this may seem to be a positive development, Rb-knockdown mice tend to develop severe hearing loss due to degeneration of the organ of Corti. For this reason, Rb seems to be instrumental for completing the development of mammalian hair cells and keeping them alive. However, it is clear that without Rb, hair cells have the ability to proliferate, which is why Rb is known as a tumor suppressor. Temporarily and precisely turning off Rb in adult mammals with damaged hair cells may lead to propagation and therefore successful regeneration. [...] Suppressing function of the <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>protein</b> in the adult rat cochlea has been found to cause proliferation of supporting cells and hair cells. Rb can be downregulated by activating the sonic hedgehog pathway, which phosphorylates the proteins and reduces gene transcription.|$|E

40|$|The {{retinoblastoma}} gene family {{consists of three}} genes: RB, p 107, and p 130. While loss of pRB causes retinoblastoma in humans and pituitary gland tumors in mice, tumorigenesis in other tissues may be suppressed by p 107 and p 130. To test this hypothesis, we have generated chimeric mice from embryonic stem cells carrying compound loss-of-function mutations in the Rb gene family. We found that Rb/p 107 - and Rb/p 130 -deficient mice were highly cancer prone. We conclude that {{in a variety of}} tissues tumor development by loss of pRB is suppressed by its homologs p 107 and p 130. The redundancy of the <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>proteins</b> in vivo is reflected by the behavior of Rb-family-defective mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro...|$|R
2500|$|In vitro, when cells {{approach}} the Hayflick limit, {{the time to}} senescence can be extended by inactivating the tumor suppressor proteins - p53 and <b>Retinoblastoma</b> <b>protein</b> (pRb). Cells that have been so-altered eventually undergo an event termed a [...] "crisis" [...] when {{the majority of the}} cells in the culture die. Sometimes, a cell does not stop dividing once it reaches crisis. In a typical situation, the telomeres are shortened and chromosomal integrity declines with every subsequent cell division. Exposed chromosome ends are interpreted as double-stranded breaks (DSB) in DNA; such damage is usually repaired by reattaching (religating) the broken ends together. When the cell does this due to telomere-shortening, the ends of different chromosomes can be attached [...] to each other. This solves the problem of lacking telomeres, but during [...] cell division anaphase, the fused chromosomes are randomly ripped apart, causing many mutations and chromosomal abnormalities. As this process continues, the cell's genome becomes unstable. Eventually, either fatal damage is done to the cell's chromosomes (killing it via apoptosis), or an additional mutation that activates telomerase occurs.|$|E
2500|$|An {{increased}} risk of HPV+OPC is observed more than 15 years after HPV exposure, pointing to a slow development of the disease, similar to that seen in cervical cancer. Relative to HPV-OPC, the oncogenic molecular progression of HPV+OPC is poorly understood. [...] The two main viral oncoproteins of the high risk HPV types are E6 and E7. These are consistently expressed in malignant cell lines, and if their expression is inhibited the malignant phenotype of the cancer cells is blocked. Either of these oncoproteins can immortalise cell lines, but are more efficient when both are expressed, since their separate molecular roles are synergistic. The E6 and E7 oncogenes become integrated into host-cell DNA, and the oncoproteins they express interfere {{with a variety of}} predominantly antiproliferative cellular regulatory mechanisms. They bind to and inactivate the best known of these mechanisms, the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>protein</b> pRB (pRb) leading to genomic instability and then cell cycle deregulation (see Chung et al., 2016 Fig. 35.2). Further, yet to be elicited, mechanisms are required for the final steps of malignant transformation of HPV infected cells.|$|E
2500|$|To achieve full {{activity}} and stabilize the active state, the activation loop of c-Raf {{needs to be}} phosphorylated. The only kinases currently known to perform this act are the Raf family kinases themselves. But some other kinases, such as PAK1 can phosphorylate other residues near the kinase domain of c-Raf: the precise role of these auxiliary kinases is unknown. In the context of c-Raf, both c-Raf and KSR1 are needed for the [...] "transphosphorylation" [...] step. Due to {{the architecture of the}} dimers, this phosphorylation can only take place in trans (i.e. one dimer phosphorylates another, in a four-membered transitional complex). [...] By interacting with conserved Arg and Lys residues in the kinase domain, the phosphorylated activation loops shift conformation and become ordered, permanently locking the kinase domain into a fully active state until dephosphorylated. The phosphorylated activation loops also render the kinase insensitive to the presence of its autoinhibitory domain. KSRs cannot undergo this last step as they miss any phosphorylatable residues in their activation loops. But once c-Raf is fully activated, there is no further need to do so: active Raf enzymes can now engage their substrates. Like most protein kinases, c-Raf has multiple substrates. BAD (Bcl2-atagonist of cell death) is directly phosphorylated by c-Raf, along with several types of adenylate cyclases, myosin phosphatase (MYPT), cardiac muscle troponin T (TnTc), etc. The <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>protein</b> (pRb) and Cdc25 phosphatase were also suggested as possible substrates.|$|E

40|$|Transcription factor Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP 2) binds {{directly}} to histones and DNA, and inhibits p 300 -mediated acetylation of core histones and reconstituted nucleosomes that contain JDP 2 -recognition DNA sequences. The region of JDP 2 that encompasses its histone-binding domain and DNA-binding region {{is essential to}} inhibit histone acetylation by histone acetyltransferases. Moreover, assays of nucleosome assembly in vitro demonstrate that JDP 2 also has histone-chaperone activity. The mutation of the region responsible for inhibition of histone acetyltransferase activity within JDP 2 eliminates repression of transcription from the c-jun promoter by JDP 2, as well as JDP 2 -mediated inhibition of retinoic-acid-induced differentiation. Thus JDP 2 {{plays a key role}} as a repressor of cell differentiation by regulating the expression of genes with an activator protein 1 (AP- 1) site via inhibition of histone acetylation and/or assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes. Senescent cells show a series of alterations, including flatten and enlarged morphology, increase in nonspecific acidic β-galactosidase activity, chromatin condensation, and changes in gene expression patterns. The onset and maintenance of senescence are regulated by two tumor suppressors, p 53 and <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>proteins.</b> The expression of p 53 and <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>proteins</b> is regulated by two distinct proteins, p 16 Ink 4 a and Arf, respectively, which are encoded by cdkn 2 a. JDP 2 inhibits recruitment of the polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC- 1 and PRC- 2) to the promoter of the gene that encodes p 16 Ink 4 a and inhibits the methylation of lysine 27 of histone H 3 (H 3 K 27). The PRCs associate with the p 16 Ink 4 a/Arf locus in young proliferating cells and dissociate from it in senescent cells. Therefore, it seems that chromatin-remodeling factors that regulate association and dissociation of PRCs, and are controlled by JDP 2, might {{play an important role in}} the senescence program. The molecular mechanisms that underlie the action of JDP 2 in cellular aging and replicative senescence by mediating the dissociation of PRCs from the p 16 Ink 4 a/Arf locus are discussed...|$|R

While much {{attention has been}} directed towards understanding the decay process and the machinery involved, the translation repression role of TTP has remained poorly understood. My thesis research identified the cap-binding translation repression 4 EHP-GYF 2 complex as a co-factor of TTP. Immunoprecipitation and in vitro pulldown assays demonstrate that TTP associates with the 4 EHP-GYF 2 complex via direct interaction with GYF 2, and mutational analyses show that this interaction occurs via conserved tetraproline motifs of TTP. Mutant TTP with diminished 4 EHP-GYF 2 binding is impaired {{in its ability to}} repress a luciferase reporter ARE-mRNA. 4 ehp knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) display increased induction and slower turnover of TTP target mRNAs as compared to wild-type MEFs. This work highlights the function of the conserved tetraproline motifs of TTP and identifies 4 EHP-GYF 2 as a co-factor in translational repression and mRNA decay by TTP. The human genome encodes for two TTP homologs, BRF 1 and BRF 2, both of which are capable of ARE binding and decay activation. I observed that TTP family proteins are differentially regulated during serum-activated G 0 -G 1 -S transition in NIH 3 T 3 cells. The G 0 -G 1 -S cell cycle transition is regulated at multiple levels to avoid erroneous or mistimed cell proliferation.
