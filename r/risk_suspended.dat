Viewed as a symbol of modernity and a reflection of wealth and individual pride, the bednet becomes physically and symbolically inappropriate in the more sacred, ‘in-between’ site of the funeral. We also uncover how risk perceptions regarding malaria transmission are re-cast in funeral spaces, with socio-cultural practices and health-related behaviours being simultaneously ‘risky’ for individual mourners and reinforcing in terms of group social cohesion.

We return, not always because those methodological ideas serve us well, but because they speak to our need for stability and order – they offer us ways of seeing the world which seem to put events reassuringly within our control.

It is most simply (admittedly, crudely) represented thus: Inputs include programme objectives.

40|$|Digoxin is {{typically}} prescribed {{in the treatment}} of heart failure. Its limited therapeutic range requires systematic monitoring of plasmatic concentration through immunoreactive tests. Laboratory results, however, can be altered by the presence of digoxin-like immunoreactive factors (DLIF) which are released in all clinical conditions involving volemic expansion. Case report. An 86 -year-old woman arrived in emergency with severe dyspnoea, atrial flutter and a medical history of ischemic cardiopathy. The patient was treated with ACE inhibitor, furosemide, spironolactone and digoxin. The first lab test for digoxin showed levels of digoxin of 7. 05 ng/ml. Although the patient did not show any clinical evidence of digital intoxication nor was she treated with drugs which might interfere with digoxin kinetics and even if she had markers of renal function within clinical limits, digoxin was suspended and a treatment was initiated with 0. 9 % NaCl solution and furosemide. The second lab test showed levels of digoxin of 8. 38 ng/ml. A possible interference of DLIF with immunoreactive tests was therefore assumed. Materials and Methods. The patient's serum was ultrafiltered and centrifugated to remove possible DLIF; subsequently, the measurement of digoxin levels was repeated. As a result, the digoxin level decreased to 0. 25 ng/ml. Conclusions. DLIF increase in several diseases, including heart failure, end-stage renal disease, pre-eclampsy and acromegaly. High digoxin levels in a patient who does not show any symptoms of digital intoxication should lead to suspect the presence of these factors and to preventively determine DLIF in serum so as not to incur the <b>risk</b> of <b>suspending</b> an important treatment like digoxin in heart failure.

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} limit {{on the effectiveness of}} vehicle interlocks is the failure of current programs to motivate more than a small fraction of eligible offenders to enroll in an interlock program. A major factor in that problem is the ability of offenders to deny that they own a vehicle. This paper discusses a method for providing an alternate control system that, being less desirable for the offender, should increase the proportion of convicted impaired drivers in interlock programs. Driving-while-suspended (DWS) is a major factor in limiting the effectiveness of license revocation on the impaired driving of motorists convicted of driving-under-the-influence (DUI) (DeYoung, Peck, & Helander, 1997). Installing an alcohol interlock on the vehicle of DUI offenders substantially reduces recidivism by 50 % or more while it is installed on the vehicle (Willis, Lybrand, & Bellamy, 2004). Offenders resist the installation of such units, however, preferring to <b>risk</b> driving while <b>suspended</b> (Voas, 2001). Consequently, the criminal justice system has been unable to motivate more than about 10 % of first and multiple DUI offenders eligible for the interlock to install the units (Voas & Marques, 2003).

Students with ASDs who attend mainstream high schools {{reported higher levels of}} anxiety and reactive anger than their peers, were reported by their teachers to engage in more aggressive behaviours, and were at higher <b>risk</b> of being <b>suspended</b> from school. The results further suggested that social anxiety is a significant moderator of the relationship between autism and physical aggression. For ASD students, but not for the control students, there was a strong, positive relationship: higher levels of anxiety were associated with higher levels of physical aggression. However, ASD students with high anger control did not display physical aggression. Our results have implications for screening students for anxiety, the provision of interventions for managing anxiety and the development of anger management skills, and for the appropriateness of suspension as a mandatory response to incidents of physical aggression in schools...|$|R
40|$|As far as {{concerns}} {{the risks of}} nanotechnology, {{the focus of attention}} is on nanomaterials and in particular on free nanoparticles. Alongside the investigation of their possible toxicity, the question of the exposure of humans and the environment is an essential element of their <b>risk</b> assessment. Nanoparticles <b>suspended</b> (distributed and embedded) freely in the air are of particular relevance, since they can easily penetrate the human body via the lungs. In addition, it is extremely difficult to monitor the spread of nanoparticles in the air. Commercially available particle counters can be used to determine the concentration of particles and droplets in the air down to a size of a few nanometres. In the light of the high background concentration of natural nanoparticles and those generated by human activity, the first priority is to distinguish between natural and synthetic nanoparticles. While an on-site concentration measurement can be carried out in a few minutes, the analysis of the nanoparticles contained in the air, that is the determination of their form and composition is only possible using complex electron microscopy procedures in the laboratory. This situation currently constitutes the main problem for determining the concentration of synthetic nanoparticles and will do so for the near future...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{multifaceted}} activity, driving requires {{experience and}} a number of skills and personality and motivational prerequisites. Research has shown that such skills are not enough to ensure safe driving in the long term. In addition to the driver's performance characteristics, modern research into traffic psychology points out the role of personality traits and motivational factors: not only do the driver's capacities (skills) need to be assessed, but also motivational and personality factors (what they want to do). The present paper reports the results of a study of a group of 2, 471 Czech drivers who underwent psychological assessment of their fitness to drive in the period 2013 - 2014. The reason for this procedure was their driving licence being suspended because of their reaching 12 points in the demerit point system or a single serious traffic violation (such as DUI or speeding). Another group comprised professional drivers with no previous problems in the performance of their work. Personality traits (personality tests – e. g. NEO-PI-R, PSSI) and skills (performance tests – e. g. VMT, D 2, IST- 2000 -R) were assessed. The results indicate differences in personality traits between the groups of <b>risk</b> drivers (licences <b>suspended)</b> and good drivers (professional drivers).

Using an a priori set of the preliminary health-based criteria, we selected nine pollutants for <b>risk</b> assessment: total <b>suspended</b> particles (TSP), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, benzo(a) pyrene (BaP), ammonia arsenic, copper, cadmium, and lead. We used dose–response functions derived from epidemiologic studies to assess individual and population risks for TSP, SO 2, NO 2, As, Cd, and Pb. We assessed both cancer (for BaP, As, and Cd) and non-cancer (for all the chosen pollutants but BaP) responses, but in this paper we discuss only the assessments of noncarcinogenic risks due to TSP, SO 2, NO 2, Pb, and Cd as examples of how the quantitative estimates of health effects can be produced by using a risk function approach.

If such children deemed {{to be at risk}} are ignored, our society will pay one way or another. A need exists to intervene early in the lives of at risk children to reduce risk factors by increasing their protective factors to enhance their resilience. This study focused on a local initiative that is an early intervention, preventive, school based multi-setting program targeting eight boys in Grades 3 and 4 who were at <b>risk</b> of being <b>suspended</b> from school. A one shot case study with a mixed method approach was used to explore the components of the Primary Assisted Learning (PAL) Program that included student support focusing on adventure based learning, parenting education using the Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) and a teacher component that focused on individualised and differentiated teacher professional development. The aim of the PAL Program was two fold, firstly to reduce the challenging behaviours of the at risk students by focusing on specific protective process factors and secondly, to enhance the students’ resilience. Findings from this study indicate perceived improvements in the students’ behaviours and enhanced resilience as reported by the students, parents and class teachers. Furthermore all reported high satisfaction levels with the PAL Program. Outcomes from this study highlight the importance of providing interventions for at risk students that are not a single factor approach but rather are complex and operate across and between ecological systems of the student, parent and teacher. Recommendations for further research are for the program to be empirically tested. Additionally, improvements could be made in gathering ongoing feedback from stakeholders and participants throughout the intervention and with more sophisti-cated measures within the program components that focus on the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data and by extending the length of the program...|$|R
40|$|These two {{productions}} {{were performed}} in repertoire at the Ludlow Festival. They continue the longstanding creative partnership of Dyer and Bogdanov and their mutual interest in producing Shakespeare's plays {{in ways that}} resonate for a modern audience. As set and costume designer for both productions Dyer had to produce a flexible space that would work for both plays. In The Merchant of Venice, Dyer and Bogdanov conceived the Rialto as the Renaissance equivalent of the stock exchange, {{the centre of the}} modern world and high <b>risk</b> capital. Dyer <b>suspended</b> a thin gauze in front of the walls of Ludlow Castle that depicted the Rialto but through which the stone walls of the castle were still visible. Above this was placed a ticker tape machine producing a rolling display of stock market prices. In this way Dyer attempted to suggest three different temporal worlds that bled into one another presenting the timelessness of the money market as the central conceptual and visual metaphor for the play. In The Winter's Tale Dyer and Bogdanov wanted to exploit the narrative potential of the play to its fullest extent. They explored the notion of a band of strolling players with an ad hoc set of costumes and props as a framing device through which the tale of Leontes and Hermione was told. Dyer introduced simple stick and cloth devices to create each scene. Working as story-tellers the actors adopted a presentational style moving in and out of character and using direct address to engage the audience in the action. Dyer supported the actors by providing an open stage with circus-like props and costumes with the potential for swift adaptation and transformation between character and locale...|$|R
40|$|The Civil Rights Project {{has been}} {{examining}} out-of-school suspensions since 1999 due to {{concerns about the}} frequency of suspensions, observed racial disparities in their systemic use and the possible negative impact, especially for children of color.   Most important, a robust study of school discipline by the Council of State Governments tracked every middle school student in Texas over 6 years and has helped educators crystalize what the evidence has always suggested: that the frequent use of out-of-school suspensions has no academic benefits, is strongly associated with low achievement, a heightened risk for dropping out and a greater likelihood of juvenile justice involvement.   If suspending a student out-of-school for minor infractions is a counterproductive educational response, logic dictates {{that it should be}} reserved as a measure of last resort. Unfortunately, education policy makers and parents are not fully aware of just how many students are at <b>risk</b> for being <b>suspended.</b> For the first time, this report and companion spreadsheet covering nearly 500 districts reveals to the public the unusually high levels of risk for suspension as well as the stark differences in discipline when these risks are presented by race, gender and disability status. The alarming findings suggest not only a hidden crisis for many historically disadvantaged subgroups in too many districts but also a widespread need to reform discipline policy for California’s public schools. Data released from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the US Department of Education revealed that more than 400, 000 students were suspended out-of-school at least one time during the 2009 - 10 school year in California.   That’s enough students suspended out-of-school to fill every seat in all the professional baseball and football stadiums in the state, with no guarantee of any adult supervision.   OCR collected data from districts on {{the number of students who}} were suspended just once during the year and the number suspended more than once. The analysis in this report combined these two mutually exclusive categories in order to report the number of students suspended one or more times as a percentage of their total enrollment.

40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctorate of Clinical Psychology (DCP) Scope: There is a known strong {{association}} between autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and anxiety. There {{is also a}} perceived but less well researched link between high-functioning autism (HFA) or Asperger’s disorder and aggressive behaviour. HFA and Asperger’s disorder are autism spectrum disorders {{where there is no}} comorbid intellectual disability. Adolescents with autism spectrum disorders have been identified as being at increased risk of early exit from schooling due to behavioural problems. Purpose: The purpose of this research was to investigate the link between anxiety and aggression in adolescents with autism using self-report measures of anxiety and anger and teacher ratings of behaviour. Anger is a primary emotion that is expressed behaviourally as aggression or violence. There are two kinds of anger: reactive anger, which is the immediate response to feelings of fear, frustration or being threatened; and instrumental anger, which {{is more likely to be}} goal-directed and malicious. It was hypothesised that aggression in adolescents with autism is characterised by high scores on measures of reactive anger but not instrumental anger, and is related to high scores on measures of anxiety. This would have implications for school policies and procedures for the management and prevention of incidents of aggression by children with autism. Methodology: This research is a correlational study comparing levels of anger, anxiety and aggression in adolescents with autism and in a control group of their typically developing peers matched for age and gender. The research was conducted in 12 high schools in the Hunter Central Coast region of New South Wales, with 105 students participating. Measures used were: • Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale: Second Edition (RCMAS- 2) • Adolescent Anger Rating Scale (AARS) • Student Behavior Survey (teacher report). Results: We found significant differences between the students with autism and their typically developing peers on each of the measures of anxiety and anger as well as on teacher-reported behaviour problems. Students with autism are more likely to be suspended from school than their peers. Regression analyses showed that social anxiety is a significant predictor of aggression for students with ASDs, but not for control students. At low levels of social anxiety, levels of physical aggression for ASD students and control group students were equally low. As social anxiety increased, physical aggression also increased for the ASD group but there was no change for the control group. While there was no significant difference in self reported anger control between the ASD group and the control group, the relationship between anger control and physical aggression was different for the two groups. Differing levels of anger control did not affect physical aggression for the control group. For the ASD group, a high level of self-reported anger control skills was associated with low levels of physical aggression. At low and average levels of anger control, physical aggression was high. Conclusions and Implications: Students with autism who attend mainstream high school report higher levels of anxiety and reactive anger than their peers, and are at higher <b>risk</b> of being <b>suspended</b> from school for aggressive behaviour. Students with better developed anger control engage in less physical aggression. This has implications for the screening of anxiety in school students, and particularly of those with autism spectrum disorders, the provision of specific interventions for managing anxiety and the development of anger management skills, and for appropriateness of suspension as a mandatory response to incidents of physical aggression in schools...|$|R
