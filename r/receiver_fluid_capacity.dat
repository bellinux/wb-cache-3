40|$|Blowout preventers are {{designed}} to shut in a well under pressure so that formation fluids that have moved into the wellbore can be contained and circulated out while continuous control of the well is maintained. Control Systems for the BOPs are of necessity highly efficient hydraulic systems. The objective is to operate functions, such as closing rams, on the BOP stack in as short a time as possible. Supplying enough volume of pressured hydraulic fluid to operate those emergency functions is essential. To have the necessary quantity of control fluid under pressure requires storing this fluid in accumulators. These accumulators operate by the expansion and compression of nitrogen gas that is separated from hydraulic fluid by either rubber bladders or pistons. Accumulators are used both {{on the surface and}} at the seafloor. As long as you use accumulators on the surface or in relatively shallow waters, you may not {{have a problem with the}} volume of hydraulic <b>fluid</b> <b>capacity</b> of gas charged accumulators. The problem may arise when the wellhead is at water depth of more than 3500 ft. In deep water drilling, the accumulators should be placed on the subsea blowout preventer stack to reduce hydraulic response times and provide a hydraulic power supply in case of interruption of surface communication. Accumulators are also used in subsea production control systems to provide local storage that allows smaller line sizes in control umbilicals. Hydraulic <b>fluid</b> <b>capacity</b> of an accumulator drops to 15 % of its capacity on the surface and even less, depending on the water depth. A large number of accumulators are needed to perform BOP functions that could have been done by just a few of them on the surface or at relatively shallow water depth. Gas inside gas charged accumulators does not behave like an ideal gas as we go to very deep water, due to high hydrostatic pressure at that water depth. The higher the ambient pressure, the more the gas behaves like a real gas rather than an ideal gas and the lower the <b>fluid</b> <b>capacity</b> of the accumulators. Compressed gas has energy in it, and can release this energy at the time desired, that??s why it is used in accumulators. Now, we have to look for something that is able to store energy, but unlike the nitrogen, its functionality must not be affected by the increasing hydrostatic pressure of water as a function of water depth. Springs and heavy weights will be discussed as two options to replace nitrogen in accumulators. Efficient deep water accumulators would reduce the number of accumulators required in deepwater and cut the cost of the project. With the advent of such efficient accumulators, we can hope that one of the numerous problems of deepwater drilling has been solved and we can think of drilling in even deeper waters...|$|R

These models are described. Several aspects of solar cooling systems design are presented here. The options of storing surplus availability at temperatures greater than 76 °C (hot storage) and at temperatures less than 12 °C (cold storage) are examined and discussed in detail.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Because {{pneumonectomy}} initiates compensatory {{growth of}} the remaining lung, we determined the time-dependent effects of pneumonectomy on alveolar <b>fluid</b> clearance <b>capacity.</b> Methods: Alveolar <b>fluid</b> clearance <b>capacity</b> with the Evans blue-labeled albumin concentration was measured in rats 3 hours, 2 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days after left pneumonectomy. The mechanisms responsible for the increase in alveolar fluid clearance were explored. Results: Alveolar fluid clearance in the remaining lung was normal through 7 days and then increased 14 and 28 days after pneumonectomy. The increase in alveolar fluid clearance at 28 days after pneumonectomy was accounted primarily {{by an increase in}} amiloride-sensitive transport. The expression of epithelial sodium channel messenger RNA was increased in the remaining lung and in type II alveolar epithelial cells isolated from rats 28 days after pneumonectomy. The number of isolated type II cells was larger in pneumonectomized rats than in control rats. Also, β-adrenergic agonist therapy increased the rate of alveolar fluid clearance at the 3 -hour and 28 -day time points. Conclusions: The capacity to remove alveolar fluid in the remaining lung is maintained at a normal level for up to 7 days after pneumonectomy in a rat, and then there is a marked increase in amiloride-sensitive alveolar <b>fluid</b> transport <b>capacity</b> that might depend, at least in part, on increased expression of epithelial sodium channels in type II cells and in part on the increased number of type II cells.

40|$|The {{influence}} of organic solvents on artificial membranes when assessing drug release from topical formulations is, generally, poorly characterised yet current guidelines require no characterisation of the membrane before, {{during or after}} an experiment. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to determine the effect of solvent-membrane interactions when using in-vitro Franz cell methods for the assessment of corticosteroid release and to assess compliance or otherwise with Higuchi's equation. The rate of beclometasone dipropionate monohydrate (BDP) and betamethasone 17 -valerate (BMV) release across a regenerated cellulose membrane (RCM), from both saturated solutions and commercial formulations, was determined. increasing the ratio of organic solvent, compared with aqueous phase, in the donor fluid (DF) resulted in up to a 416 -fold increase in steady-state flux, Further, alterations in the <b>receiver</b> <b>fluid</b> (RF) composition caused, in some cases, 337 -fold increases in flux. Analysis indicated that the RCM remained chemically unchanged, that its pore size remained constant and that no drug partitioned into the membrane, regardless of the DF or RF employed.
