40|$|TechDemoSat- 1 is a UK-funded {{technology}} demonstration satellite, carrying 8 payloads {{provided by}} UK organisations, which {{is due to}} be launched {{in the first quarter of}} 2014. Cranfield University has supplied a De-Orbit Sail (DOS) payload to allow the mission to comply with end-of-life debris mitigation guidelines. The payload provides a passive, simple, and low-cost means of mitigating debris proliferation in Low Earth Orbit, by enhancing spacecraft aerodynamic drag at end-of-life and reducing time to natural orbital decay and re-entry. This paper describes the use of small commercial electro-explosive devices (EEDs), produced for use as parachute tether-cutters in reserve chute deployment systems, as low-cost but high-reliability <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> <b>for</b> space applications. A testing campaign, including thermal vacuum and mechanical vibration, is described, which demonstrates the suitability of these CYPRES™ cutters, with a flexible Kevlar clamp band, for use as a hold-down and <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> (HDRM) <b>for</b> a deployable de-orbit sail.

Bomb shackles of this type are found in a B-29 aircraft fuselage on display at the National Museum of the USAF in Dayton, Ohio.

50|$|Between {{the end of}} the '80s and the {{beginning}} of the '90s, INR was suddenly revolutioned after the work of two italian physicians: Cesare Gianturco and Guido Guglielmi. The first combined a ∂eep knowledge of diagnostic radiology with a great ability to solve technical and manual problems. He invented Gianturco's coils, which he used to make the first attempts to embolize arteries and aneurysms. Gianturco also patented the first endovascular stent approved by the American FDA; a device with a great legacy. In the second half of the 1980s, Hilal was the first in Columbia University to use coils to treat brain aneurysms; but this technique was inaccurate and dangerous because the coils were released with little control with great risk of occluding the vessel from which the aneurysm originated. The coil embolization was revolutionized by the work of Guido Guglielmi in UCLA, who realized that electricity could function as a controlled <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>for</b> coils; in 1991 he published two works dealing with the embolization of brain aneurysms by means of detachable platinum coils (Guglielmi's coils).

50|$|A large {{asteroid}} hurtles {{through space}} {{on a collision}} course with the Moon. As Moonbase Alpha is located within the impact area, the staff quickly formulates a plan to avert disaster. To guarantee the asteroid's destruction, twelve nuclear charges will be planted at strategic locations. The Eagle task force delivers eleven of the charges as planned. At minus two minutes to detonation, the twelfth, carried by Alan Carter's Eagle One, has yet to be deployed. The ship has developed a malfunction in its main booster and cannot achieve full thrust. To give Carter the time necessary to complete the operation, John Koenig orders the blast delayed. Victor Bergman protests; the timeline must be preserved in order to avoid their being caught in radiation and debris from the explosion. Circumstances worsen when Carter finally arrives at his designated site. After lowering the charge, the <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>for</b> the cargo grip jams—the explosive cannot be deployed. Agonising over this latest setback, Koenig informs the astronaut that the charge must remain on site...at any cost. Desperate, Carter shorts the grip mechanism, then manoeuvres his ship until the charge is dislodged. As Eagle One departs at a modest speed, Koenig delays the blast another ten seconds to give the astronaut a fighting chance.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{calculation of the}} stresses associated with changes in volume during phase transitions of olivine in a descending slab results in a double layer of high shear stress along the metastable olivine wedge in the depth range 350 – 460 km. Stress in the upper layer is in-plane tensional and stress in the lower layer is down-dip compressional. The modeled stress field agrees with observations of stress in the Tonga double seismic zone. High shear stress also exists in the slab at depths below the metastable wedge. This stress distribution involves down-dip compression and trench-parallel tension, which agrees with {{about half of the}} focal mechanisms in the Tonga slab at depths of 460 – 690 km.

40|$|Na-, K-, Cl-, and S-species {{released}} during {{thermal conversion}} of coal can cause several {{problems such as}} fouling, slagging and corrosion, especially in gas turbines and heat recovery systems.

Results from the study indicate that a highly local, intense precipitation event led to the triggering of the landslide, by excess pore water pressures occuring in relation to a convex terrain feature.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{applicability}} of fine particle ethylcellulose (FPEC) to produce matrix tablets by a wet granulation technique was evaluated. The effect of various formulation and process variables, such as FPEC content, hardness of the tablet, and solubility of the drug, on the release of drug from these tablets was examined. Tablets were prepared by wet granulation of drug and FPEC in an appropriate mass ratio. Theophylline, caffeine, and dyphylline were selected as nonionizable model drugs with solubilities from 8. 3 to 330 mg/mL at 25 °C. Ibuprofen, phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride were selected as ionizable drugs with solubilities from 0. 1 to 2000 mg/mL at 25 °C. Drug release studies were conducted in 37 °C water with UV detection. As the FPEC content and the hardness of the tablets increased, the release rate of the drug decreased.
