500|$|Bauer {{said that}} {{nobody in the}} {{administration}} itself directly discussed the offer with Sestak, {{and he does not}} believe there was anything improper, illegal or unethical about the conduct. Republicans in Congress disagreed, arguing the action contradicted claims Obama made during his presidential campaign about ethical conduct and transparency in government. Darrell Issa, in particular, felt it was an impeachable offense and referred to it as [...] "Obama's Watergate". Nevertheless, the matter gradually became less of a focus during the primary election, where other topics like spending and the economy took the spotlight. With Issa poised to become chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform following the Republican Party recapturing the house during the 2010 midterm elections, it was widely expected he would launch an official investigation into the job offer based on his prior critical comments about the matter. However, on November 5, Issa announced he would not pursue an investigation. Some politicians and members of the media said that the job offer made to Sestak was neither illegal nor abhorrent, and that such deals are regularly made by politicians of all levels. Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post felt the matter only appeared to be a scandal because the White House badly mishandled the response, and Chicago Tribune writer John Kass wrote, [...] "Offering a spot to an ambitious young politician to protect an old servile weakling isn't new. Presidents do it, governors do it. Big-city mayors <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do it." ...|$|E

In a 1979 interview, Preston attributed the single's comparative lack of success in North America to inexperience {{on the part of}} Apple Records, saying: [...] "At that time, the company didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> promote – because you didn't have to promote a Beatle record!" ...|$|E

He said of his departure from Weezer: [...] "I don't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> speak on this because I don't know what should be kept private and what should be shared.

This extended to a ten-shot lead after five holes in the final round. Kaymer found trouble in the bunkers, resulting in a round of 75 and a fall to third place behind Frenchman Gary Stal, who secured his first European Tour victory, and world number one Rory McIlroy. Speaking after the round, Kaymer told the media that he was [...] "in shock" [...] at the result: [...] "I'm surprised and shocked," [...] the German said. [...] "I don't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> put it into words. It was very, very surprising today. It will take me {{a few days to}} reflect on this.

Kiedis {{completed}} the rehab and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). Flea has referred to the album as [...] "the 'rockingest' record" [...] the band has ever made. The Uplift Mofo Party Plan proved to be far more successful, commercially and critically, than the Chili Peppers' preceding albums, registering at number 148 on the Billboard 200. Following the Uplift tour, Slovak's drug use dramatically increased. Flea's relationship with Slovak faded, and Slovak became isolated and depressed. On 28 June 1988, Slovak was found dead of a heroin overdose. Flea reflected: [...] "I didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deal with that sadness, and I don't think [...] knew {{how to deal with it}} either." [...] Irons, who was taking Slovak's death particularly hard, left the group.|$|E

2500|$|Richter {{explained}} {{his approach to}} performance as follows: [...] "The interpreter is really an executant, carrying out the composer's intentions to the letter. [...] He doesn't add anything that isn't already in the work. [...] If he is talented, he allows us to glimpse {{the truth of the}} work that is in itself a thing of genius and that is reflected in him. [...] He shouldn't dominate the music, but should dissolve into it." [...] Or, similarly: [...] "I am not a complete idiot, but whether from weakness or laziness have no talent for thinking. I know only how to reflect: I am a mirror [...] [...] [...] Logic does not exist for me. I float on the waves of art and life and never <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> distinguish what belongs to the one or the other or what is common to both. Life unfolds for me like a theatre presenting a sequence of somewhat unreal sentiments; while the things of art are real to me and go straight to my heart." ...|$|E

While Kiki isn't interested in a serious relationship, she recognizes that Morgan really cares for her but she still feels something is missing. Kiki also believes marrying Morgan will help her get over Michael. By the time she marries Morgan, Kiki and Michael have made peace {{with the fact that}} they can't be together. However everything changes when it is revealed that Morgan knew Michael and Kiki weren't related before the wedding. A shocked Kiki doesn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> react and though she is angry at Morgan for his lies, she is relieved that she now has a valid reason {{to walk away from the}} marriage she never truly wanted. Throughout her relationship with Michael, Kiki remains very close with Morgan. However, after her split from Morgan, the two are practically attached at the hip. Erin said Kiki is able to look back on their relationship fondly and see that [...] "Morgan has been there for her this entire time" [...] and she realizes how good of a guy he is. The romantic feelings quickly resurface when the duo pretend to be romantically involved to spite Michael. [...] "Kiki has rediscovered her feelings for Morgan, for sure" [...] said Erin. The story featured actress Hayley Erin's very first onscreen kiss and her first love scene which was covered by Extra. Erin credited Bryan Craig for helping her through the scenes.
