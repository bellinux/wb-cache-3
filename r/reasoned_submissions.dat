2500|$|The Statute of the Court and TFEU require {{judges are}} {{appointed}} {{only if they}} have no political occupation, with independence [...] "beyond doubt". They are selected for renewable six-year terms by [...] "common accord" [...] of governments, with the advice of seven EU or member state judges that the Council and Parliament selects. The Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, article 11, says the court is usually organised into chambers of 3 or 5 judges each. A [...] "grand chamber" [...] of 15 more senior judges sit on questions of [...] "difficulty or importance", or those requested by member states. The court's President and Vice-President are elected by other judges for renewable 3-year terms by secret ballot. Judges can only be dismissed if all other judges and Advocate Generals unanimously agree. Advocate Generals are appointed by the court to give <b>reasoned</b> <b>submissions</b> on cases, especially involving new points of law. Unlike judges on the Court, they write opinions as themselves, rather than collectively, and often with a command of prose and reason, and while not binding are often followed in practice. In addition, each judge has secretaries or referendaires who research and write. Unlike the UK where judges always write their own opinions, referendaires often assist drafting the judgments in the Court of Justice. The Court's Translation Directorate will translate every final judgment into the 24 official languages of the European Union. The three main kinds of judgments the Court of Justice gives following (1) preliminary rulings, requested by the courts of member states, (2) enforcement actions, brought by the Commission or Member States, against the EU, a member state, or any other party that is alleged to violate EU law, and (3) other direct actions, where the EU or member state is involved as {{a party to the}} dispute, and gives final rulings. The Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, modelled on the International Court of Justice, begin with submission of written cases to the court, followed by a short oral hearing. In each case a judge is designated to actively manage the hearing (called a rapporteur) and draft the judgment (probably with help from referendaires). The court always deliberates and votes before the final opinion is written and published. Cases in the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice on points of law. While there is no formal appeal procedure from the Court of Justice, in practice its actions are subject to scrutiny by both the supreme courts of member states and the European Court of Human Rights, even if the final balance of power is unresolved.|$|E

40|$|Six {{months have}} rolled by like a blink of the {{geologic}} eye. This simile is translatable {{into a good}} Fermi problem involving units of time and proportional reasoning. As the reader will note the journal has moved from 2 to 3 issues a year, a simple arithmetical incremental for various <b>reasons.</b> <b>Submissions</b> to the journal have steadily increased. About {{a year or so}} ago, in my editorial in vol 4. no 2 [June 2007], I reported receipt of 86 manuscripts in 16 months. In the ensuing 12 months the journal received 107 submissions including several from angle trisectors, circle squarers and relativity debunkers, and 10 or so manuscripts in advanced pure mathematics that were beyond the scope of the journal. Sieving these submissions aside, the journal is averaging 90 manuscripts a year, with an acceptance rate of ~ 30 %. The increase in the flow of manuscripts has created a severe backlog of articles necessitating an increase in frequency of issues per year. Henceforth the journal will move to 3 issues per year, one double issue and one normal issue per volume. Vol 5, nos 2 & 3 [July 2008] is the first double issue of The Montana Mathematics Enthusiast, consisting of ~ 300 pages of interesting features, dialogues and a critical notice. The feature articles cover the entire scope of topics the journal purports to address, and the diversity of the authors reveals the geographic reach of the journal.

Population {{studies have shown that}} PSH is a common headache. However, most people suffer attacks of low frequency or intensity and seldom seek for medical assistance. There are few clinic-based studies of PSH, and its real influence as a primary cause for referral to neurology outpatient offices is to be determined. We aim to investigate the burden of PSH as main complaint in an outpatient headache clinic. We reviewed all patients with PSH (ICHD-II criteria), attended in an outpatient headache clinic in a tertiary hospital during a 2. 5 -year period (January 2008 –June 2010). We considered demographic and nosological characteristics and if PSH was main cause of submission. 36 patients (26 females, 10 males) out of 725 (5 %) were diagnosed of PSH. Mean age at onset 34. 1  ±  2. 9  years (range 10 – 72). Mean time from onset to diagnosis 68. 8  ±  18. 3  months.

Within the state are also created various non-governmental organizations, to protect victims of family violence, whose address this issue and try preventively to influence to the society to eliminate or mitigate the consequences of the family violence. Domestic violence as a phenomenon and as a form of criminality was written a lot, in international as well as national levels.

60|$|Government may be {{regarded}} as consisting of two parts: the one, {{the decisions of the}} community or its recognized organs; the other, the enforcing of those decisions upon all who resist them. The first part is not objected to by Anarchists. The second part, in an ordinary civilized State, may remain entirely in the background: those who have resisted a new law while it was being debated will, as a rule, submit to it when it is passed, because resistance is generally useless in a settled and orderly community. But the possibility of governmental force remains, and indeed is the very <b>reason</b> for the <b>submission</b> which makes force unnecessary. If, as Anarchists desire, there were no use of force by government, the majority could still band themselves together and use force against the minority. The only difference would be that their army or their police force would be ad hoc, instead of being permanent and professional. The result of this would be that everyone would {{have to learn how to}} fight, for fear a well- drilled minority should seize power and establish an old-fashioned oligarchic State. Thus the aim of the Anarchists seems hardly likely to be achieved by the methods which they advocate.|$|R

By the early 7th-century, Chaghaniyan became {{independent}} from Hephthalite rule, and {{came under the}} control of local Iranian rulers known as the “Chaghan Khudah”. During the Muslim conquest of Persia, the Chaghan Khudah aided the Sasanians against the Rashidun Arabs. However, the Arabs, after having dealt with the Sasanian Empire, began focusing on the local rulers of Khorasan, which included the Chaghan Khudah and many other local rulers. In 652, the Chaghan Khudah, along with the rulers of Talaqan, Guzgan, and Faryab, aided the ruler of southern Tokharistan against the Arabs. Nevertheless the Arabs managed to emerge victorious. However, the Rashidun Caliphate soon fell into civil war, and was conquered by another Arab family, who founded the Umayyad Caliphate. During the early 660s, the Chaghan Khudah, named Turantash, sent an envoy under his chancellor Pukarzate to Varkhuman, the Sogdian king of Samarkand.In 705, the Arab general Qutayba ibn Muslim managed to make the Chaghan Khudah, whose name is mentioned as Tish, acknowledge Umayyad authority.

To date the report covers Questions 1 - 3, 12, 16 and 24 - 25 of the Issues Paper. Analysis of the other questions will be added as it becomes available.   The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) released its National Classification Scheme Review Issues Paper on 19 May, 2011. The ALRC received over 2, 300 submissions in response, over five times as many submissions as it has received for any previous enquiry. Of the submissions received, the ALRC had 819 requests that the submission remain confidential. It is the policy of the ALRC to make submissions publicly available on its website unless otherwise requested. In all but two cases, the confidentiality request came from a member of the public not wishing to have their identity made available on the website, rather than from an organisation presenting material that was commercial-in-confidence or restricted for other <b>reasons.</b> Two <b>submissions</b> were not able to be made public in full, due to the graphic nature of some content. In addition, there were submissions that could not be made public either because they divulged personal details, they were not in a format lending itself to online posting (e. g. were handwritten), or were blank submissions. Over 95 per cent of submissions responding to the Issues Paper came from individuals, with the balance from organisations, industry or professional associations, or companies. The category of “Organisation” includes government agencies, religious organisations, lobby and interest groups, political parties and other entities with an official status. Among the “Individual” submissions were expert submissions from academics, former classifiers, parliamentarians and recognised experts in the field. Nonetheless, the vast majority of submissions came from members of the general public. The ALRC makes an online submission form available and encourages its use by submitters. For those making use of the online submission form, there is a template response form, which invited comment on each of the 29 questions that the ALRC had raised in its Issues Paper. Where the online submission form was not used, most respondents nonetheless took the opportunity to address questions individually, accompanied by some overall commentary on classification issues from their perspective. It was not obligatory to answer all questions, so some questions received considerably more responses than others. Reflecting its commitment to transparent inquiry processes, the ALRC has provided a preliminary analysis of responses to seven key questions, as well as a general overview of submissions received. This will be updated to include the full range of responses as they become available...|$|R

However, nurses without CNS education fulfill CNS positions {{in a number of}} healthcare organizations in North Carolina (NC). The NC Board of Nursing (NCBON) implemented a regulation change for mandatory recognition to practice as a CNS. The purpose of this scholarly project was to explore the impact of the regulation relevant to job title and description changes; thus, access to CNS care. A non-experimental, descriptive project was conducted through an internet survey on a convenience sample of 11, 478 master’s or higher degree prepared nurses. A majority (88. 5 %) of the sample size (n = 218) reported sustainment of their CNS job title; while 13 % reported a job title change. Of those with a job title change, 6 % reported a job description change and 12 % were uncertain of changes in job performance. There was no significant association (p <. 05) between changes in job title, job description or performance of responsibilities with <b>reason</b> for portfolio <b>submission.</b> Accurate data analysis of CNSs in NC was tenuous due to the self-report nature prior to regulation. The findings suggest CNSs engaged in policy advocacy for their title and role at the organizational level. The NCBON improved the CNS practice by the regulation change; still, for those who submitted a portfolio and/or reported changes in job titles and job descriptions, compels reevaluation to ensure the regulation is upheld for recognition in order to practice at an advanced practice level. Further education is necessary on the distinct four APRN roles. The results of this project warrant further investigation on the long-term effect of CNS practice at the individual, organizational and community level. D. N. P...|$|R

The acceptance of submissions with ICERs higher than the threshold was assessed across different agencies and across indications, in order to inform future reimbursement submissions. Methods: All HTA appraisals from May 2000 to May 2014 from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), and Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) were assessed. Multiple technology appraisals, resubmissions, vaccination programs, and requests for advice were excluded. Submissions not reporting an ICER, or for which an ICER could not be determined were also excluded. The remaining appraisals were reviewed, and the submitted ICER, recommendation, and reasoning behind the recommendation were extracted. Results: NICE recommended the highest proportion of submissions with ICERs higher than the threshold (34 % accepted without restrictions; 20 % with restrictions), followed by PBAC (16 % accepted without restrictions; 4 % with restrictions), SMC (11 % accepted without restrictions; 14 % accepted with restrictions), and CADTH (0 % accepted without restrictions; 26 % with restrictions). Overall, the majority of higher-than-threshold ICER submissions were classified into the "malignant disease and immunosuppression" therapeutic category; however, there was no notable variation in acceptance rates by disease area. <b>Reasons</b> for accepting <b>submissions</b> reporting ICERs above the threshold included high clinical benefit over the standard of care, and addressing an unmet therapeutic need. Conclusion: Acceptance of submissions with higher-than-threshold ICERs varied by HTA agency and was not significantly influenced by disease category. Such submissions must be accompanied by robust, concrete, and transparent evidence in order to achieve patient access.

First, it describes the system of our social security itself. The next section deals with the development of the pension insurance from its beginnings to the present time. Since 1996, the applicable legal regulation has been Act No. 155 / 1995 Coll. on pension insurance, but it has been amended several times. The last major amendment has been parameter changes from 1 January 2010. In subsequent chapters, the theoretical part deals with old-age pensions and, in particular, early old-age pensions, it explains the conditions of eligibility and related concepts such as insurance period, retirement age, pension application. The main objective of the thesis was to find out about the <b>reasons</b> for the <b>submission</b> of an application for a reduced early retirement. Other objectives were to find out whether they have sufficient information on all conditions of eligibility for this type of pension and what factors influenced their decision. To achieve the objectives, the qualitative method was used; the techniques of the research included semi-structured interviews and a secondary data analysis. The sample consisted of a total of 15 respondents (five unemployed persons, five employed persons and five self-employed persons). The research has shown that the reasons of applicants are similar not only within each group, but also between them (fatigue, health problems). The secondary data analysis was used to illustrate the size and structure of the basic sample. The results show that the early retirement is applied for by a relatively low number of people with higher education. I believe that currently early retirement has an indispensable role in the social security system and it should remain a part of it in the future. However, the thesis also shows that people in their pre-retirement age are not offered another appropriate alternative. The thesis should serve to raise awareness about the issues early retirement...|$|R

The proposal consists {{of a number of}} key ingredients which we briefly discuss in this section. -Specification and implementation: A common scenario in the development of any artifact is to first create a specification of the form and behaviour of the the artifact, and then realise an implementation which satisfies the specification. The specification is characterised by a lack of implementation details, but having a close correspondence to the requirements; conversely an implementation may lack close correspondence to the requirements. This submission maintains this important distinction. Relations provide a specification oriented view of the relationship between models and are specified in a language that can be easily understood. They say what it means to translate between several models but without saying precisely how the translation is achieved. Those details are realised by mappings which characterise the means by which models are translated. It should be noted though, that while the mappings language is rich enough to provide an implementation of relations it also manages to maintain a requirements oriented focus. This may give rise to a scenario where developers prefer to omit relations and directly define mappings. -Scalability and reuse: Decomposition is a key approach to managing complexity. This submission provides a number of composition mechanisms whereby relations and mappings can be composed to form more complex specifications. These mechanisms also aid reuse since mappings and relations can be treated as reusable components which are composed for specific contexts. -Usability: Diagrammatic notations have been important to the success of many OMG standards. This proposal presents a diagrammatic notation which is an extension of collaboration object diagrams and is therefore familiar to many end users. A criticism often levelled at diagrammatic notations is their scalability. This submission also presents a textual syntax, constructs of the diagrammatic notations are closely aligned with its textual counterpart. Considering the domains of relations and mappings at the generic type level is often too limiting. Instead it often is specific-types of things that are of interest. This submission uses patterns to describe the domains of both relations and mappings. Patterns are a means of succinctly describing specific-types of model elements and enable domains of interest to be rapidly stated with ease. -Semantic soundness: By definition a standard should give rise to consistency across differing implementations. It is important that an end user can get the same results on two different implementations. For this <b>reason,</b> this <b>submission</b> goes to some effort to ensure that all the constructs have a well-defined semantic basis. This is achieved by treating the submission in two parts. The infrastructure part has a small number of constructs which can be easily and consistently understood from informal descriptions (although a mathematical semantics is given in Appendix B for the sake of completeness and rigour). The superstructure part uses the infrastructure as its semantic basis and defines the syntax that the end user deals with. The relationship between the superstructure and the infrastructure is expressed as a translation...|$|R
40|$|The {{internet}} {{has become a}} daily, integrated part of life for many Australian families. It is an essential tool for all Australians, {{an integral part of}} our economic and social activities, and a vast resource of information, education and entertainment. The ability for young Australians to use online tools effectively provides both a skill for life and the means to acquire new skills. The internet provides children with a means through which they can exchange information, be entertained, socialise, do school work and conduct research. Studies show that over 95 per cent of young Australians use the internet regularly. Almost daily internet use is common for children as young as eight or nine. This rapidly changes in the ‘tween’ years with many 10 - 12 year olds using the internet from 1 - 3 hours per day. By 13, social media use has become the norm; and by 15, the internet and its use has become an ‘organic integrated part’ of the everyday lives of Australian children. Whilst the popularity of various online activities – including email, games, chat, shopping, and passive consumption of music and videos – varies with different age groups, social media use has grown dramatically to overtake other forms of online entertainment and communications used by Australian children. In 2011, the use of social media was identified as the primary form of digital communication between young people over 13, overtaking more traditional digital means such as text messages, phone calls and email. While around half of young Australians aged between 8 and 11 years use social media sites, this figure dramatically increases to around 90 per cent for 12 to 17 years olds.   Research on the specific social media usage habits of children and young people indicates that the small minority of 12 - 17 year olds that do not have a Facebook account (usually due to parental control) felt that they suffer a degree of social isolation and exclusion. This increased exposure to the internet and social media is also enhanced with the increase in ownership of internet-connected mobile devices, with research indicating that: 	 53 per cent of children own or access their first internet connected device before 10 years old; and 	around half of 14 - 17 year olds access the internet through mobile phones, with 43 per cent of them having their own smartphone. _______ Public Consultation Process As set out in The Coalition’s Policy to Enhance Online Safety for Children, the Australian Government is committed to implementing a range of measures to improve the online safety of children in Australia, some of which include: the establishment of a Children’s e-Safety Commissioner; developing an effective complaints system, backed by legislation, to get harmful material down fast from large social media sites; and examining existing Commonwealth legislation to determine whether to create a new, simplified cyber-bullying offence. The Department of Communications (the Department) is seeking views on the issues raised in this discussion paper to assist in providing advice to the Government to enhance online safety for children. This paper is for consultation purposes only and does not necessarily represent current government policy. Questions are included in boxes throughout the paper to guide discussion. Respondents are invited to provide written submissions or comments to address these questions, or provide a more general response if preferred. Submissions must include the respondent’s name, organisation (if relevant) and contact details. Submissions with no verifiable contact details will not be considered. Respondents should be aware that submissions will generally be made publicly available, including on the Department’s website (www. communications. gov. au). The Department reserves the right not to publish any submission, or part of a submission, which {{in the view of the}} Department contains potentially defamatory material, or where it considers it appropriate to do so for confidentiality or other <b>reasons.</b> All <b>submissions</b> will be treated as non-confidential information unless the respondent specifically requests the submission, or a part of the submission, is kept confidential, and acceptable reasons accompany the request. Email disclaimers will not be considered sufficient confidentiality requests. Note that submissions will generally be subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The Privacy Act 1988 establishes certain principles with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of information about individuals by the Department. Any personal information respondents provide to the Department through their submission is used only for the purposes of consideration of issues raised in this paper. Respondents should clearly indicate in their submission if they do not wish to have their name included in any summary of submissions that the Department may publish.
