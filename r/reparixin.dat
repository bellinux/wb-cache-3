40|$|BackgroundIschemia–reperfusion (IR) {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to graft rejection after liver transplantation. During IR injury, an intense inflammatory process occurs in the liver. Neutrophils are considered central players in the events that lead to liver injury. CXC chemokines mediate hepatic inflammation following reperfusion. However, few studies have demonstrated in real-time the behavior of recruited neutrophils. We used confocal intravital microscopy (IVM) to image neutrophil migration in the liver and to analyze in real-time parameters of neutrophil recruitment in the inflamed tissue in animals treated or not with <b>reparixin,</b> an allosteric antagonist of CXCR 1 / 2 receptors. Materials and methodsWT and LysM-eGFP mice treated with <b>reparixin</b> or saline were subjected to 60 [*]min of ischemia followed by different times of reperfusion. Mice received Sytox orange intravenously to show necrotic DNA in IVM. The effect of <b>reparixin</b> on parameters of local and systemic reperfusion-induced injury was also investigated. ResultsIR induced liver injury and inflammation, as evidenced by high levels of alanine aminotransferase and myeloperoxidase activity, chemokine and cytokine production, and histological outcome. Treatment with <b>reparixin</b> significantly decreased neutrophil influx. Moreover, <b>reparixin</b> effectively suppressed the increase in serum concentrations of TNF-α, IL- 6, and CCL 3, and the reperfusion-associated tissue damage. The number of neutrophils in the liver increased between 6 and 24 [*]h of reperfusion, whereas the distance traveled, velocity, neutrophil size and shape, and cluster formation reached a maximum 6 [*]h after reperfusion and then decreased gradually. In vivo imaging revealed that <b>reparixin</b> significantly decreased neutrophil infiltration and movement and displacement of recruited cells. Moreover, neutrophils had a smaller size and less elongated shape in treated mice. ConclusionImaging of the liver by confocal IVM was successfully implemented to describe neutrophil behavior in vivo during liver injury by IR. Treatment with <b>reparixin</b> decreased not only the recruitment of neutrophils in tissues but also their activation state and capacity to migrate within the liver. CXCR 1 / 2 antagonists may be a promising therapy for patients undergoing liver transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Chemotherapy-induced {{peripheral}} neuropathy (CIPN) {{is a type}} of neuropathic pain that represents a frequent and serious consequence of chemotherapy agents. Over the last years, significant progress has been achieved in elucidating the underlying pathogenesis of CIPN. The interference of taxanes with microtubule has been proposed as a mechanism that leads to altered axonal transport and to permanent neurological damages. The inflammatory process activated by chemotherapeutic agents has been considered as a potential trigger of nociceptive process in CIPN. In this study we investigated the effect of <b>reparixin,</b> an inhibitor of CXCR 1 / CXCR 2, in suppressing the development of paclitaxel-induced nociception in rats. Moreover, <b>reparixin</b> activity in reversing the neurotoxic effects induced by paclitaxel or GRO/KC in F 11 cells was also analyzed. <b>Reparixin</b> administered by continuous infusion ameliorated paclitaxel-induced mechanical and cold allodynia in rats. In F 11 cells, <b>reparixin</b> was able to inhibit the increase of acetyladed a-tubulin induced both by paclitaxel and GRO/KC. The subsequent experiments were performed in order to dissect the signal transduction pathways under GRO/KC control, eventually modulated by paclitaxel and/or <b>reparixin.</b> To this aim we found that <b>reparixin</b> significantly counteracted p-FAK, p-JAK 2 /p-STAT 3, and PI 3 K-p-cortactin activation induced either by paclitaxel or GRO/KC. Overall the present results have identified IL- 8 /CXCR 1 / 2 pathway as a mechanism involved in paclitaxel-induced {{peripheral neuropathy}}. In particular, the obtained data suggest that the inhibition of CXCR 1 / 2 combined with standard taxane therapy, in addition to potentiating the taxane anti-tumor activity can reduce chemotherapyinduced neurotoxicity, thus giving some insight for the development of novel treatments...|$|E
40|$|In {{breast cancer}} {{it has been}} {{proposed}} {{that the presence of}} cancer stem cells may drive tumor initiation, progression and recurrences. IL- 8, up-regulated in breast cancer, and associated with poor prognosis, increases CSC self-renewal in cell line models. It signals via two cell surface receptors, CXCR 1 and CXCR 2. Recently, the IL- 8 /CXCR 1 axis was proposed as an attractive pathway for the design of specific therapies against breast cancer stem cells. <b>Reparixin,</b> a powerful CXCR 1 inhibitor, was effective in reducing in vivo the tumour-initiating population in several NOD/SCID mice breast cancer models, showing that the selective targeting of CXCR 1 and the combination of <b>reparixin</b> and docetaxel resulted in a concomitant reduction of the bulk tumour mass and CSC population. The available data indicate that IL- 8, expressed by tumour cells and induced by chemotherapeutic treatment, is a key regulator of the survival and self-renewal of the population of CXCR 1 -expressing CSC. Consequently, this investigation on the mechanism of action of the reparixin/paclitaxel combination, was based on the observation that <b>reparixin</b> treatment contained the formation of metastases in several experimental models. However, specific data on the formation of breast cancer brain metastases, which carry remarkable morbidity and mortality to a substantial proportion of advanced breast cancer patients, have not been generated. The obtained data indicate a beneficial use of the drug combination <b>reparixin</b> and paclitaxel to counteract brain tumour metastasis due to CSC, probably due to the combined effects of the two drugs, the pro-apoptotic action of paclitaxel and the cytostatic and anti-migratory effects of <b>reparixin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Acute lung injury (ALI) {{remains a}} major {{challenge}} in critical care medicine. Both neutrophils and chemokines have been proposed as key components {{in the development of}} ALI. The main chemokine receptor on neutrophils is CXCR 2, which regulates neutrophil recruitment and vascular permeability, but no small molecule CXCR 2 inhibitor has been demonstrated to be effective in ALI or animal models of ALI. To investigate the functional relevance of the CXCR 2 inhibitor <b>Reparixin</b> in vivo, we determined its effects in two models of ALI, induced by either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhalation or acid instillation. Experimental approach: In two ALI models in mice, we measured vascular permeability by Evans blue and evaluated neutrophil recruitment into the lung vasculature, interstitium and airspace by flow cytometry. Key results: Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR 2 by <b>Reparixin</b> reduced CXCL 1 -induced leukocyte arrest in the microcirculation of the cremaster muscle, but did not influence arrest in response to leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) demonstrating specificity. <b>Reparixin</b> (15 mgg 1) reduced neutrophil recruitment in the lung by approximately 50 % in a model of LPS-induced ALI. A higher dose did not provide additional reduction of neutrophil recruitment. This dose also reduced accumulation of neutrophils in the interstitial compartment and vascular permeability in LPS-induced ALI. Furthermore, both prophylactic and therapeutic application of <b>Reparixin</b> improved gas exchange, and reduced neutrophil recruitment and vascular permeability in a clinically relevant model of acid-induced ALI...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Ischemic stroke {{may result}} from {{transient}} or permanent reductions of regional cerebral blood flow. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils {{have been described as}} the earliest inflammatory cells to arrive in ischemic tissue. CXCR 1 / 2 receptors are involved in the recruitment of these cells.

In this work, we investigated the effects of <b>reparixin,</b> an allosteric antagonist of CXCR 1 / 2 receptors, in a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion in mice. METHODS: C 57 BL/ 6 J male mice treated with <b>reparixin</b> or vehicle were subjected to a middle cerebral artery occlusion procedure 1 h after the treatment. Ninety minutes after ischemia induction, the monofilament that prevented blood flow was removed. Twenty-four hours after the reperfusion procedure, behavioral changes, including motor signs, were analyzed with the SmithKline/Harwell/Imperial College/Royal Hospital/Phenotype Assessment (SHIRPA) battery.

30|$|The {{chemokine}} IL- 8 is overexpressed {{in multiple}} cancer types, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it promotes {{the acquisition of}} mesenchymal features, stemness, and chemoresistance. The current research explores the utility of a clinical-stage monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL- 8 as a potential therapeutic option for TNBC [36]. IL- 8 showed increased expressions in paclitaxel-treated advanced breast cancer and this over-production effect was inhibited in TLR 4 -silenced cells. The acquired TLR 4 -mediated paclitaxel resistance in advanced breast cancer is explained partly by the paracrine effect of IL- 8 release [37]. Cytokines produced by breast cancer cells after chemotherapy withdrawal activate both Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappa-B pathways, which in turn further promote breast cancer cells to produce and secrete cytokines, forming an autocrine inflammatory forward-feedback loop to facilitate the enrichment of drug-resistant breast cancer cells [38]. Moreover, such an autocrine forward-feedback loop can also be diminished by IL- 8 neutralizing antibody or blockade of IL- 8 receptors CXCR 1 / 2 with <b>reparixin,</b> and, in a human xenograft model, administration of <b>reparixin</b> after chemotherapy withdrawal effectively attenuates tumor masses [38]. Breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapeutic drugs exhibited poor survival rate and shorter disease-free survival time if their tumor samples expressed high level of IL- 8, or its receptor, CXCR 1, CXCR 2 [38].|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Chemokines orchestrate {{neutrophil}} recruitment to inflammatory foci. In {{the present}} study, we evaluated {{the participation of}} three chemokines, KC/CXCL 1, MIP- 2 /CXCL 2 and LIX/CXCL 5, which are ligands for chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR 2), in mediating neutrophil recruitment in immune inflammation induced by antigen in immunized mice. Experimental approach: Neutrophil recruitment was assessed in immunized mice challenged with methylated bovine serum albumin, KC/CXCL 1, LIX/CXCL 5 or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha. Cytokine and chemokine levels were determined in peritoneal exudates and in supernatants of macrophages and mast cells by elisa. CXCR 2 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) expression was determined using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Key results: Antigen challenge induced dose- and time-dependent neutrophil recruitment and production of KC/CXCL 1, LIX/CXCL 5 and TNF-alpha, but not MIP- 2 /CXCL 2, in peritoneal exudates. Neutrophil recruitment was inhibited by treatment with <b>reparixin</b> (CXCR 1 / 2 antagonist), anti-KC/CXCL 1, anti-LIX/CXCL 5 or anti-TNF-alpha antibodies and in tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 -deficient mice. Intraperitoneal injection of KC/CXCL 1 and LIX/CXCL 5 induced dose- and time-dependent neutrophil recruitment and TNF-alpha production, which were inhibited by <b>reparixin</b> or anti-TNF-alpha treatment. Macrophages and mast cells expressed CXCR 2 receptors. Increased macrophage numbers enhanced, while cromolyn sodium (mast cell stabilizer) diminished, LIX/CXCL 5 -induced neutrophil recruitment. Macrophages and mast cells from immunized mice produced TNF-alpha upon LIX/CXCL 5 stimulation. Methylated bovine serum albumin induced expression of ICAM- 1 on mesenteric vascular endothelium, which was inhibited by anti-TNF-alpha or anti-LIX/CXCL 5. Conclusion and implications: Following antigen challenge, CXCR 2 ligands are produced and act on macrophages and mast cells triggering the production of TNF-alpha, which synergistically contribute to neutrophil recruitment through induction of the expression of ICAM- 1.

The nociceptive test consisted of evoking a hindpaw flexion reflex with a hand-held force transducer (electronic anesthesiometer) adapted with a 0. 5 mm(2) polypropylene tip. The intraplantar administration of methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) in previously immunized (IM), but not in sham-immunized (SI) mice, induced mechanical hypernociception in a dose-dependant manner. Hypernociception induced by antigen was reduced in animals pretreated with IL-lra and <b>reparixin</b> (a non-competitive allosteric inhibitor of CXCR 2), and in TNF receptor type 1 deficient (TNFR 1 -/-) mice. Consistently, antigen challenge induced a time-dependent release of TNF-alpha, IL- 1 beta and KC/CXCL- 1 in IM, but not in SI, mice. Consistently, antigen challenge induced a time-dependent release of TNF-alpha, IL- 1 beta and KC/CXCL- 1 in IM, but not in SI, mice. The increase in TNF-alpha levels preceded the increase in IL- 1 beta and KC/CXCL 1. Antigen-induced release of IL- 1 beta and KC/CXCL 1 was reduced in TNFR 1 -/- mice, and TNF-alpha induced hypernociception was inhibited by IL-lra and <b>reparixin.</b> Hypernociception induced by IL- 1 beta in immunized mice was inhibited by indomethacin, whereas KC/CXCL 1 -induced hypernociception was inhibited by indomethacin and guanethidine, Antigen-induced hypernociception was reduced by indomethacin and guanethidine and abolished by the two drugs combined. Together, {{these results suggest that}} inflammation associated with an adaptive immune response induces hypernociception that is mediated by an initial release of TNF-alpha, which triggers that subsequent release of IL- 1 beta and KC/CXCL 1.

40|$|Ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) may {{facilitate}} graft rejection {{is the main}} cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. During IRI, an intense inflammatory process occurs in the liver. Hepatic inflammation is initiated by the ischemic period but occurs mainly during the reperfusion time, and is characterized by marked neutrophil recruitment to the liver. The role of neutrophils as the main amplifiers of liver injury has been recognized in many publications. However, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil recruitment during liver IRI are not well known. Additionally, the molecules necessary for this type of migration are poorly defined. Here, we investigated different pathways used by neutrophils to infiltrate the liver and cause damage during inflammation induced by a model of liver IRI. We showed that IR induced significant liver injury, as observed by high levels of hepatic transaminases, neutrophil recruitment and tissue damage. We used intravital microscopy to show that neutrophil behavior changes during liver injury. During IRI, the number of neutrophils increased between 6 h and 24 h of reperfusion, whereas the distance traveled, velocity, neutrophil size, cluster formation and neutrophil shape reached maximum 6 h after reperfusion. Neutrophil migration correlated with liver injury and was dependent on the chemokine receptors CXCR 1 / 2, since mice treated with <b>Reparixin</b> had reduced liver injury and inflammation. In vivo imaging also revealed that <b>Reparixin</b> decreased neutrophil infiltration, migration and displacement. Moreover, neutrophils had smaller size and less elongated shape, indicating reduced activation. Moreover, we documented that MMP- 9 expressed by neutrophils {{is likely to be a}} key factor in cell transmigration and activation. The lack of Mmp- 9 led to protection against liver IRI, as observed by reduced levels of transaminases, cytokines and histological evaluation. Interestingly, we documented that MMP- 9 seems to control neutrophil degranulation. We showed that lack of Mmp- 9 impaired neutrophil release of others enzymes, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), elastase and neutrophil gelatinase B-associated lipocalin (NGAL). Finally, we also demonstrated that disruption of the interaction between glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and chemokines protected mice against liver IRI. Mice treated with a peptide containing the 30 C-terminal amino acids of CXCL 9 (MIG 30) showed reduced liver injury and inflammation. We conclude that pharmacological manipulation or gene deletion of one of these pathways hold promise as strategies to treat IR and improve overall graft success in liver transplantation. nrpages: 96 status: submitte...|$|E
40|$|Proteinase-activated receptor- 2 (PAR- 2) {{expression}} {{levels are}} altered in several CNS disorders with these changes being proposed to either exacerbate or diminish the disease state {{depending on the}} cell type in which this occurs. Here we present data investigating the consequence of PAR- 2 activation on kainate (KA) -induced neurotoxicity in organotypic hippocampal slices cultures (OHSC). Exposure of OHSC to the PAR- 2 activators trypsin or Ser-Leu-Ile-Gly-Arg-Leu (SLIGRL) induced no neurotoxicity when applied alone but was neuroprotective against KA-induced neurotoxicity. SLIGRL-mediated neuroprotection involved astrocytic activation as the neuroprotective effect was abolished following OHSC pre-treatment with fluoroacetate. Moreover, co-application of either <b>reparixin</b> or LY 341495, antagonists of the CXCR 2 chemokine receptor and metabotropic glutamate receptors respectively, inhibited the SLIGRL-mediated neuroprotection. SLIGRL application inhibited both p 38 MAPK and ERK activity in OHSC, but not the JNK 1 / 2 signalling pathway. Accordingly, the co-application of the p 38 MAPK and ERK inhibitors SB 203580 and UO 126 reduced KA-induced cell death, mimicking PAR- 2 -mediated neuroprotection. These data indicate that PAR- 2 activation is neuroprotective and involves astrocytic activation, gliotransmitter release, and the subsequent inhibition of MAPK signalling cascades, providing further evidence for PAR- 2 as an interesting therapeutic target in certain CNS disorders...|$|E
40|$|Chronic pain in {{autoimmune}} diseases, like {{rheumatoid arthritis}} (RA), {{is a common}} and life- changing problem for many patients. Treatment is usually aimed at reducing inflammation and preserving the function of affected tissues. Chronic pain, however, often persists despite optimal disease control. Autoimmune pain arises from multiple mechanisms {{with a wide range}} of characteristics that differs between individuals. For effective management of the pain, it is essential to understand these mechanisms. One of the hallmarks in the pathogenesis in most autoimmune diseases is the presence of autoantibodies. In RA, several types of antibodies are well characterized, but little is known about their interaction with the sensory system. Thus, the aim of this thesis is explore mechanisms involved in pain signaling, specifically the role of disease-relevant antibodies as inducers of pain. In Paper I and II, we investigate the effect of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) on pain behavior and interaction with immune cells. When injected into mice, both polyclonal human ACPA or murinized monoclonal ACPA induces spontaneous and evoked pain-like behavior in the absence of inflammation. Additionally, the antibodies induce trabecular bone loss measured with micro-CT. The antibodies localize to joint and bone marrow, binding osteoclasts and its precursors. Using cultures of mice and human osteoclasts, we show that ACPA bind structures on the cells, causing proliferation and release of the chemokine CXCL 1 /IL- 8. The effect of the release is increased bone resorption and activation of sensory neurons, causing pain-like behavior, which can be reversed by treating the mice with the CXCR 1 / 2 blocker <b>reparixin.</b> In Paper III, we demonstrate that mice injected with antibodies specific to the cartilage protein collagen type II (anti-CII mAbs) displays pronounced mechanical hypersensitivity and reduction in locomotion at time points when visual, histological and molecular indications of inflammation were completely absent. Further, this effect was not mediated by the activation of complement factors or by changes in the cartilage structure. Instead our data point to a direct action of anti-CII mAb/collagen immune complexes on the sensory neurons through neuronally expressed Fc-gamma receptor IIb (FcγRIIb), causing increased inward currents, intracellular Ca 2 + levels, and calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) release. Importantly, the nociceptive properties of anti-CII mAbs were lost when the Fc-FcγR interaction was disrupted in vivo. In summary, we have described two novel mechanisms of how disease-relevant antibodies can activate sensory neurons, causing pain-like behavior. These results deepen the understanding of pain mechanisms in autoimmune disease and potentially to new ways of treating the pain component in patients...|$|E
40|$|Autoantibody-positive {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA), also called seropositive RA, is characterised {{by the presence}} of anti citrullinated proteins antibodies (ACPA) that can be detected in blood several years before disease onset. Joint inflammation, pain and bone destruction are major features of the disease. Classically bone destruction and pain have been considered to be late events in the disease development, resulting from long lasting and uncontrolled inflammation. However, both bone loss and pain have been reported in both seropositive individuals not yet having the disease and those seropositive individuals just being diagnosed with seropositive RA. Taken together these findings suggest that other factors than uncontrolled joint inflammation might drive the process of bone loss and pain in RA. We hypothesized that antibodies themselves and specifically ACPA might play a direct role in mediating bone loss and pain and aimed to investigate the role of ACPAs in bone metabolism and pain-like behaviour in mice. To investigate bone metabolism, we focused on studies of osteoclasts (OC), cells responsible for bone loss in vitro (by assessing formation and maturation of OC in cell cultures and estimating their capacity to degrade bone matrix in vitro) and in vivo (by micro-CT analysis of the bone density). We have demonstrated that polyclonal and monoclonal ACPAs isolated from the blood and synovial fluid of RA patients enhance the number of OC and of their bone resorptive capacity in vitro. This effect was accompanied by a significant increase of IL- 8 levels in OC supernatants and abolished by neutralizing anti IL- 8 antibodies. Further, ACPA injected in mice were shown to bind to CD 68 -positive OC precursors in bone marrow {{in the vicinity of the}} joints and to promote trabecular bone loss, which was also reversed by blocking the mice homologues of IL- 8, CXCL 1 / 2 by using <b>reparixin.</b> In parallel to bone destruction ACPA also induced pain-like behaviour in mice, that similar to bone loss was also abolished by CXCL 1 / 2 blocking. Taken together these findings suggest that ACPA promote bone loss by inducing IL- 8 that in turn can further amplify the bone loss process and induce pain-behaviour. As ACPA, but no other immunoglobulins (non-ACPA immunoglobulins from RA patients, non-ACPA Ig from healthy individuals) were able to promote bone loss, we investigated the role of citrullination in ACPA-mediated osteoclastogenesis. We demonstrated that citrullination by peptidyl arginine deiminases (PAD) enzymes is essential for the physiological development and maturation of OCs but no other cells (such as synovial fibroblasts). This finding might explain the ACPA preference for OCs. Further we showed that ACPA bind to targets expressed on the surface of OCs. Blocking the citrullination machinery by PAD enzyme inhibitors significantly abrogates ACPA binding to OCs and ACPA-mediated osteoclastogenesis. OCs could develop from different cell precursors and inflammatory conditions, such as joint inflammation in RA, promote the transdifferentitation of immature DC (iDC) into OCs. In order to investigate if ACPA might also play a role in this proces, we analyzed the capacity of polyclonal and monoclonal ACPA to promote the in vitro transdifferentation of iDC to OC. We showed that despite a clearly distinct protein profile as compared to classical macrophage OC precursors, iDC are able to develop into remarkably similar OCs. Plasticity towards OC differentiation correlated with PAD activity and protein citrullination expression levels in iDC cultures. Citrullinated actin and vimentin were present in iDCs and iDC-derived OCs and both proteins were deposited on the cell surface, co-localising with ACPAs binding to the cells. ACPAs enhanced OC differentiation from both monocyte-derived iDCs and from circulating CD 1 c+ DCs. Blocking either PAD activity or ACPA-induced IL- 8 secretion completely abolished the stimulatory effects of citrulline-targeting antibodies on DC-OC transdifferentiation. We further explored the mechanisms involved in the plasticity of iDC and their capacity to develop into OCs showing that cell culture densities and lactate concentrations are essential mediators. DCs originating from dense cultures developed in the presence of high lactic acid doses, have high PAD activity and increased efficiency to convert into OC and erode bone. In contrast, DCs from sparse cultures have low PAD activity with decreased OC potential. In conclusion, the current thesis describes novel mechanisms by which RA-associated antibodies target OC to induce bone loss and pain. Our studies provide insights into the mechanisms by which systemic autoimmunity might target the joints and suggest potential novel ways to prevent this...|$|E
40|$|A major {{population}} of patients affected with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory idiopathic myopathies (IIM, collectively called myositis) {{is characterized by}} the presence of autoantibodies. The pathogenic impact of anti-citrullinated protein/peptide (ACPA) or anti-histidyl transfer RNA synthetase (HisRS; Jo 1) autoantibodies remains largely unknown. The aims of the thesis were to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the autoimmune component (specifically, the auto-antibody and -antigen dynamics) in RA and myositis; and to develop ACPA neutralizing compounds. Paper I: Purified anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (aCCP 2 IgG) were estimated to represent ~ 2 % of the total RA IgG pool, and demonstrated to display distinct and individual reactivities against citrullinated epitopes from fibrinogen, collagen type II, α-enolase and vimentin. In-vivo generated autoantigens in synovial tissue and fluid were recognized by aCCP 2 IgG. Paper II: Anti-CCP 2 IgG purified according to the methodology described in paper I were injected in mice and shown to induce pain-like behaviour. The underlying molecular mechanism appears to be chemokine-dependent because 1) aCCP 2 IgG promoted activation of murine osteoclasts with generation of CXCL 1 (human IL- 8); 2) aCCP 2 IgG stained CD 68 -bearing macrophages/osteoclasts, closely localized to the calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) -positive sensory nerve fibers; 3) <b>reparixin,</b> a CXCL 1 / 2 receptor antagonist, blocked aCCP 2 IgG induced pain. Papers III and IV: Endogenously citrullinated fibrinogen peptides were found to be recognized by a large portion of sera from the Epidemiological Investigation of RA (EIRA) cohort. CCP 2 + RA sera displayed 65 % and 15 % immune reactivity against peptides from the fibrinogen α chain Cit 573 (563 - 583) and Cit 591 (580 - 600), respectively. Peptides from the β chain, Cit 72 (62 - 81) and Cit 74 (62 - 81), were recognized by 35 % and 53 % of the CCP 2 + RA patients. The same fibrinogen peptides were shown to in vitro individually bind and block purified aCCP 2 IgG in a dose-dependent manner, displaying a maximum of 83 % blockade. Approximately 90 % autoantibodies were neutralized by Cit 573 and Cit 591 combined, and further improvement of the blocking capacity was registered (> 90 %) when incubating aCCP 2 IgG with a cyclic version of Cit 573. Since the peptide Cit 573 (also termed [Cit 573]fib(563 - 583)) showed the best inhibition percentage, a truncated version was inserted into the stable framework sunflower trypsin inhibitor- 1 (SFTI- 1, and denoted s 1 [Cit 573]fib(566 - 580)). This compound showed enhanced blocking capacity, 79 % antibodies were neutralized with an estimated IC 50 of 20 μM, in comparison to the linear counterparts (73 % maximum inhibition with the IC 50 :s ranging from 59 to 123 μM). Stability in blood was also improved, with above 90 % of s 1 [Cit 573]fib(566 - 580) remaining after five hours, whereas the cyclic and linear counterparts were degraded after one hour. Using a mutant of s 1, s 2 [Cit 573,Arg 575]fib(566 - 580), anti-[Cit 573]fib(563 - 583) IgG (aCit 573 IgG) were purified from RA plasma and estimated to comprise 0. 33 % of the total RA IgG pool. Binding affinity measurements demonstrated that aCit 573 IgG bind the mutant scaffold peptide s 3 [Cit 573,Arg 575]fib(566 - 580) with high affinity (Kd = 2 nM). Thus, subsets of ACPA recognizing citrullinated fibrinogen epitopes appear to be of high affinity. Paper V: The cytoplasmic autoantigen HisRS was found in extracellular compartments (bronchoalveolar lavage, BAL, sera and plasma). High circulating levels of HisRS were found in myositis, and further increased in anti-HisRS+ patients; significant levels of HisRS were also detected in healthy individuals, whereas anti-HisRS IgG, IgA and IgM autoantibodies were only detected in sera and BAL from patients with myositis. In addition, anti-TRIM 21 IgG were also identified in myositis BAL, positively correlating with the presence of anti-HisRS IgG. A so far uncharacterized factor in BAL of myositis patients was found to bind exogenous HisRS. In experiments addressing platelet activation, HisRS was found to trigger platelet activation in a dose-response dependent manner at low picomolar concentrations. In conclusion, the development of a methodology to isolate autoantibodies from RA patients’ plasma, serum and synovial fluid, provided opportunities to address the pathogenic role of ACPA. Purified aCCP 2 IgG induced pain-like behaviour, raising a possible mechanism for the pain RA patients occasionally feel before clinical onset of disease or after being medicated and in remission. A stable, high affinity anti-citrullinated fibrinogen autoantibody blocking compound was designed and we propose ACPA neutralization with fibrinogen-derived peptides as a complimentary treatment strategy for ACPA+RA. ACPA pain mediated effect may also be a functional target, amenable for blocking. The presence of HisRS extracellularly suggests novel and so far undescribed functions, which merits further investigations. Finally, a possible coupled immune response among HisRS and TRIM 21 in lungs of myositis patients provides new clues for the development of autoimmunity in myositis and the associated anti-synthetase syndrome...|$|E
