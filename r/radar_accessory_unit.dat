500|$|The {{high-pressure}} compressor (HPC), {{that was}} at the center of the original export controversy, features nine stages in all variants of the CFM56. The compressor stages have been developed from GE's [...] "GE1/9 core" [...] (namely a single-turbine, nine-compressor stage design) which was designed in a compact core rotor. The small span of the compressor radius meant that the entire engine could be lighter and smaller, as the <b>accessory</b> <b>units</b> in the system (bearings, oiling systems) could be merged to the main fueling system running on aviation fuel. As design evolved HPC design improved through better airfoil design. As part of the Tech-56 improvement program CFMI has tested the new CFM-56 model with six-stage high-pressure compressor stages (discs that make up the compressor system) that was designed to deliver same pressure ratios (pressure gain 30) similar to the old nine-stages compressor design.

40|$|The Azores {{archipelago}} is a {{small and}} remote region with low population levels where the issues of sustainability and autonomy have always been important and present significant economic consequences. Currently, the construction industry uses many imported products; however, masonry products are almost exclusively provided by local industries. For its production, masonry uses a natural volcanic scoria -lapilli, locally known as bagacina-as an aggregate, though not in an optimized way. The goal of our study was to improve the existing masonry base unit through geometric changes and to design a new masonry system, comprising <b>accessory</b> <b>units</b> shaped to provide specific wall functions, the constraints of which derived from specific island features, from the traditional building process and from the more recent performance requirements {{in order to obtain}} an inclusive system. We concluded that by adopting a different geometric shaping for the bagacina concrete base unit it would ensure greater sustainability. This sustainability comes from the improved use of a local resource and from the potential consequences of this improvement, such as the possibility of reducing the use of imported products like wall thermal insulation materials.

40|$|<b>Accessory</b> {{dwelling}} <b>units</b> {{have long}} been utilized as an alternative strategy of homeowners within single-family neighborhoods of the United States in response to changing needs in living arrangements. The American Planning Association defines an <b>accessory</b> dwelling <b>unit</b> (ADU) as either a self-contained living area located {{within the walls of}} an existing home or a freestanding structure on the same lot as the principal dwelling unit. While it is difficult to accurately identify all of the municipalities that allow the creation of ADUs in single-family neighborhoods, their presence was long established prior to the enactment of zoning regulations in cities across the United States. It is expected that current population trends and changing demographics will result in greater demand for a diversity of housing types to provide for the growing needs of society. For many U. S. communities the potential effects of the ADU strategy may help address their present and future needs in relation to overall community goals. Research suggests there is a reemerging interest for <b>accessory</b> dwelling <b>units</b> within single-family neighborhoods to accommodate the rise of non-traditional households. For many communities it is becoming increasingly important, with the facilitation of local city officials, to draw upon the experience of other communities that have incorporated ADUs in order to better understand the positive and negative consequences associated with the ADU housing strategy. Recent research efforts have revealed a number of key factors that have limited communities in the past from realizing the full potential of a successful ADU program. My research was conducted with a specific focus aimed at the efforts of local planning as a division of municipal government. The City of Lawrence, Kansas, was selected as the sole case subject to be studied. The conclusion of this study suggests a variety of factors that, if improved at the local level, could better support an effective ADU program. The overall results of this research should be applied both specifically to the city of Lawrence, as well as to create generally applicable guidelines for other municipalities that are either exploring how to improve their current ADU program or {{are in the process of}} introducing provisions to support ADUs.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) of DLR in Berlin has {{provided}} spec-tral measurements of planetary analogues from the visible to the far-infrared range for comparison with remote sens-ing spacecraft/telescopic measurements of planetary surfaces [1 - 5]. Bi-directional reflection, transmission and emis-sion spectroscopy are the techniques we used to acquire spectral data of target materials. In fall 2015 we started upgrading our laboratory set-up, adding a new spectrometer, three external sources, and new detectors and beamsplitters to further extend the spectral range of measurements that can be performed in the laboratory. Reflecting the wider scope of measurement capabilities the facility was renamed to Planetary Spectros-copy Laboratory (PSL). Two FTIR instruments are operating at PSL, in an air-conditioned room. The spectrometers are two Bruker Ver-tex 80 V that can be evacuated to. 1 mbar. One spectrometer is equipped with aluminum mirrors optimized for the UV, visible and near-IR, the second features gold-coated mirrors for the near to far IR spectral range. Apart from the mirrors the two instruments are identical, and can therefore share the collection of detectors and beamsplitters {{we have in our}} equipment to cover a very wide spectral range. The instruments and the <b>accessory</b> <b>units</b> used are fully automatized and the data calibration and reduction are made with software developed at DLR[4].

40|$|AbstractAlthough K+ {{channels}} {{are essential for}} hepatocellular function, {{it is not known}} which {{channels are}} involved in the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in these cells. We have used a combination of electrophysiological and molecular approaches to describe the potential candidates for these channels. The dialysis of short-term cultured rat hepatocytes with a hypotonic solution containing high K+ and low Cl− concentration caused the slow activation of an outward, time-independent current under whole-cell configuration of the patch electrode voltage clamp. The reversal potential of this current suggested that K+ was the primary charge carrier. The swelling-induced K+ current (IKvol) occurred in the absence of Ca 2 + and was inhibited with 1 μM Ca 2 + in the pipette solution. The activation of IKvol required both Mg 2 + and ATP and an increasing concentration of Mg–ATP from 0. 25 through 0. 5 to 0. 9 mM activated IKvol increasingly faster and to a larger extent. The KCNQ 1 inhibitor chromanol 293 B reversibly depressed IKvol with an IC 50 of 26 μM. RT-PCR detected the expression of members of the KCNQ family from KCNQ 1 to KCNQ 5 and of the accessory proteins KCNE 1 to KCNE 3 in the rat hepatocytes, but not KCNQ 2 and KCNE 2 in human liver. Western blotting showed KCNE 3 expression in a plasma membrane-enriched fraction from rat hepatocytes. The results suggest that KCNQ 1, probably with KCNE 2 or KCNE 3 as its <b>accessory</b> <b>unit,</b> provides a significant fraction of IKvol in rat hepatocytes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} 3 D objects {{registration and}} modelling for cadastral objects within the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) framework. A conceptual model {{as well as}} the associated technical model for the 2 D and 3 D objects have been proposed and developed for Malaysia. For both private and public land, the main subdivision of land in Malaysia is based on lots. In many continental European countries, ‘lot’ would be called ‘parcel’, but ‘parcel’ has other meaning in Malaysian context. The lots can have 2 D or 3 D representations. The Strata Title Act and Strata Management Act are very important for {{a large part of the}} Land Administration in Malaysia, and this is especially true for many 3 D related situations. The Malaysian LADM country profile includes the support for these strata objects: building and building parts (all in 3 D within a single lot), land parcel (with house no more than 4 storeys within a single lot), which can be refined with parcel <b>unit,</b> <b>accessory</b> <b>unit,</b> and (limited) common property unit including support for provisional and multilayer/underground aspects. In addition, the Malaysian country profile also supports the legal spaces for utilities. By developing a Malaysian country profile based on the international standard ISO 19152, the possible confusion related to terminology (e. g lots, parcels, strata, 2 D, 3 D) has been resolved. This is not only important for Malaysia, but also useful for many other countries, that have the strata title system. OTBArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} goal of cancer immunology is {{the identification of}} antigens associated with tumor destruction. Vaccination with irradiated tumor cells engineered to secrete granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) generates potent, specific, and long-lasting antitumor immunity in multiple murine tumor models. A phase I clinical trial of this vaccination strategy in patients with advanced melanoma demonstrated the consistent induction of dense CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates in distant metastases, resulting in extensive tumor destruction, fibrosis, and edema. Antimelanoma antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses were associated with tumor cell death. To characterize the targets of these responses, we screened an autologous cDNA expression library prepared from a densely infiltrated metastasis with postvaccination sera from a long-term responding patient. High-titer IgG antibodies detected ATP 6 S 1, a putative <b>accessory</b> <b>unit</b> of the vacuolar H+–ATPase complex. A longitudinal analysis of this patient revealed an association between the vaccine-induced increase in antibodies to ATP 6 S 1 and tumor destruction. Three additional vaccinated melanoma patients and three metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma patients vaccinated with autologous GM-CSF-secreting tumor cells similarly showed a correlation between humoral responses to ATP 6 S 1 and tumor destruction. Moreover, a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient who experienced a complete remission after CD 4 + donor lymphocyte infusions also developed high-titer antibodies to ATP 6 S 1. Lastly, vaccination with GM-CSF-secreting B 16 melanoma cells stimulated high-titer antibodies to ATPS 1 in a murine model. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that potent humoral responses to ATP 6 S 1 are associated with immune-mediated destruction of diverse tumors...|$|R
