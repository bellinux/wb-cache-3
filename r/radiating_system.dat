40|$|Though {{commonly}} used to calculate Q-factor and fractional bandwidth, the energy stored by <b>radiating</b> <b>systems</b> (antennas) is a subtle and challenging concept that has perplexed researchers for over half a century. Here, the obstacles in defining and calculating stored energy in general electromagnetic systems are presented from first principles as well as using demonstrative examples from electrostatics, circuits, and <b>radiating</b> <b>systems.</b> Along the way, the concept of unobservable energy is introduced to formalize such challenges. Existing methods of defining stored energy in <b>radiating</b> <b>systems</b> are then reviewed in a framework based on technical commonalities rather than chronological order. Equivalences between some methods under common assumptions are highlighted, along with the strengths, weaknesses, and unique applications of certain techniques. Numerical examples are provided to compare the relative margin between methods on several radiating structures...|$|R

5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} important example of a <b>radiating</b> <b>system</b> {{is a pair of}} mass points with equal masses orbiting each other on a circular orbit (an approximation to e.g. special case of binary black holes). Since the dipole moment is constant, we can for convenience place the coordinate origin right between the two points. Then the dipole moment will be zero, and if we also scale the coordinates so that the points are at unit distance from the center, in opposite direction, the system's quadrupole moment will then simply bewhere M is the mass of each point, and [...] are components of the (unit) position vector of one of the points. As they orbit, this x-vector will rotate, which means that it will have a nonzero first, and also the second time derivative (this is of course true regardless the choice of the coordinate system). Therefore the system will radiate gravitational waves. Energy lost in this way was first inferred in the changing period of the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar, a pulsar in orbit with another neutron star of similar mass.|$|E
5000|$|In {{classical}} physics, {{the intensity}} of each frequency of light produced in a <b>radiating</b> <b>system</b> {{is equal to the}} square of the amplitude of the radiation at that frequency, so attention next fell on amplitudes. The classical equations that Heisenberg hoped to use to form quantum theoretical equations would first yield the amplitudes, and in classical physics one could compute the intensities simply by squaring the amplitudes. But Heisenberg saw that [...] "the simplest and most natural assumption would be" [...] to follow the lead provided by recent work in computing light dispersion done by Kramers. The work he had done assisting Kramers in the previous year [...] now gave him an important clue about how to model what happened to excited hydrogen gas when it radiated light and what happened when incoming radiation of one frequency excited atoms in a dispersive medium and then the energy delivered by the incoming light was re-radiated — sometimes at the original frequency but often at two lower frequencies the sum of which equalled the original frequency. According to their model, an electron that had been driven to a higher energy state by accepting the energy of an incoming photon might return in one step to its equilibrium position, re-radiating a photon of the same frequency, or it might return in more than one step, radiating one photon for each step in its return to its equilibrium state. Because of the way factors cancel out in deriving the new equation based on these considerations, the result turns out to be relatively simple.|$|E

"May 2011 "As high power microwave technologies have advanced, demands have called for sources and radiators to become more compact. The University of Missouri has designed and simulated a compact <b>radiating</b> <b>system</b> for a compact virtual cathode oscillator. The <b>radiating</b> <b>system</b> has been developed to efficiently radiate high power microwaves in the 4 to 6 GHz range from an input mode of TE 11. The system produces a radiation pattern with a directivity of approximately 10 to 15 dB. Utilizing finite element modeling techniques, the behavior of these high power electromagnetic waves can be accurately described inside the <b>radiating</b> <b>system</b> {{as well as in the}} near and far field regions. These techniques in turn improve the quality of high power experiments performed on the compact structure.

40|$|We {{study the}} role played by multiply-connectedness in the time {{evolution}} of the energy E(t) of a <b>radiating</b> <b>system</b> that lies in static flat space-time manifolds M_ 4 whose t=const spacelike sections M_ 3 are compact in at least one spatial direction. The radiation reaction equation of the radiating source is derived for the case where M_ 3 has any non-trivial flat topology, and an exact solution is obtained. We also show that when the spacelike sections are multiply-connected flat 3 -manifolds the energy E(t) exhibits a reverberation pattern with discontinuities in the derivative E(t). It emerges from this result that the compactness in at least one spatial direction of Minkowski space-time is sufficient to induce this type of topological reverberation, making clear that our <b>radiating</b> <b>system</b> is topologically fragile. An explicit solution of the radiation reaction equation for the case where M_ 3 = R^ 2 × S^ 1 is discussed, and graphs which reveal how the energy varies with the time are presented and analyzed...|$|E
