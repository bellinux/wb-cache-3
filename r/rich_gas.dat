30|$|Shale {{formations}} in North America such as Bakken, Niobrara, and Eagle Ford {{have huge}} oil in place, 100 – 900 {{billion barrels of}} oil in Bakken only. However, the predicted primary recovery is still below 10 %. Therefore, seeking for techniques to enhance oil recovery in these complex plays is inevitable. Although most of the previous studies in this area recommended that CO 2 {{would be the best}} EOR technique to improve oil recovery in these formations, pilot tests showed that natural gases performance clearly exceeds CO 2 performance in the field scale. In this paper, two different approaches have been integrated to investigate the feasibility of three different miscible gases which are CO 2, lean <b>gases,</b> and <b>rich</b> <b>gases.</b> Firstly, numerical simulation methods of compositional models have been incorporated with local grid refinement of hydraulic fractures to mimic the performance of these miscible gases in shale reservoirs conditions. Implementation of a molecular diffusion model in the LS-LR-DK (logarithmically spaced, locally refined, and dual permeability) model has been also conducted. Secondly, different molar-diffusivity rates for miscible gases have been simulated to find the diffusivity level in the field scale by matching the performance for some EOR pilot tests which were conducted in Bakken formation of North Dakota, Montana, and South Saskatchewan. The simulated shale reservoirs scenarios confirmed that diffusion is the dominated flow among all flow regimes in these unconventional formations. Furthermore, the incremental oil recovery due to lean <b>gases,</b> <b>rich</b> <b>gases,</b> and CO 2 gas injection confirms the predicted flow regime. The effect of diffusion implementation has been verified with both of single porosity and dual-permeability model cases. However, some of CO 2 pilot tests showed a good match with the simulated cases which have low molar-diffusivity between the injected CO 2 and the formation oil. Accordingly, the <b>rich</b> and lean <b>gases</b> have shown a better performance to enhance oil recovery in these tight formations. However, <b>rich</b> <b>gases</b> need long soaking periods, and lean gases need large volumes to be injected for more successful results. Furthermore, the number of huff-n-puff cycles has a little effect on the all injected gases performance; however, the soaking period has a significant effect. This research project demonstrated how to select the best type of miscible gases to enhance oil recovery in unconventional reservoirs according to the field-candidate conditions and operating parameters. Finally, the reasons beyond the success of natural gases and failure of CO 2 in the pilot tests have been physically and numerically discussed.|$|R

50|$|In gas {{nitriding}} the donor is a nitrogen <b>rich</b> <b>gas,</b> usually ammonia (NH3), {{which is why}} it is sometimes known as ammonia nitriding. When ammonia comes into contact with the heated work piece it dissociates into nitrogen and hydrogen. The nitrogen then diffuses onto the surface of the material creating a nitride layer. This process has existed for nearly a century, though only in the last few decades has there been a concentrated effort to investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics involved. Recent developments have led to a process that can be accurately controlled. The thickness and phase constitution of the resulting nitriding layers can be selected and the process optimized for the particular properties required.|$|E

5000|$|The ship {{proceeded}} in a {{sharp turn}} to approach for its landing. That generates extremely high tension in the after part of the ship, {{and especially in the}} center sections close to the stabilizing fins which are braced by shear wires. I can imagine that one of these shear wires parted and caused a rent in a gas cell. If we will assume this further, then what happened subsequently can be fitted in to what observers have testified to here: Gas escaped from the torn cell upwards and filled up the space between the outer cover and the cells in the rear part of the ship, and then this quantity of gas which we have assumed in the hypothesis was ignited by a static spark.Under these conditions, naturally, the gas accumulated between the gas cells and the outer cover must have been a very <b>rich</b> <b>gas.</b> That means it was not an explosive mixture of hydrogen, but more of a pure hydrogen. The loss of gas must have been appreciable.I would like to insert here, because the necessary trimming moments to keep the ship on an even keel were appreciable, and everything apparently happened in the last five or six minutes, that is, during the sharp turn preceding the landing maneuver, that therefore {{there must have been a}} <b>rich</b> <b>gas</b> mixture up there, or possibly pure gas, and such gas does not burn in the form of an explosion. It burns off slowly, particularly because it was in an enclosed space between outer cover and gas cells, and only in the moment when gas cells are burned by the burning off of this gas, then the gas escapes in greater volume, and then the explosions can occur, which have been reported to us at a later stage of the accident by so many witnesses.The rest it is not necessary for me to explain, and in conclusion, I would like to state this appears to me to be a possible explanation, based on weighing all of the testimony that I have heard so far.|$|E
