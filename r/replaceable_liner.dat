5000|$|Mod 0: used {{mechanical}} fuze setter. Two-piece rifled construction, with <b>replaceable</b> <b>liner</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Abrasion can {{be reduced}} by lining the throat with silicon carbide brick or fitting it with a <b>replaceable</b> <b>liner.</b> Abrasion can also occur {{downstream}} of the throat section. To reduce abrasion here, the elbow {{at the bottom of}} the scrubber (leading into the separator) can be flooded (i.e. filled with a pool of scrubbing liquid).Particles and droplets impact on the pool of liquid, reducing wear on the scrubber shell.|$|E
50|$|The 100 mm (3.9 in) L/65 caliber Type 98 gun {{utilized}} {{a horizontal}} sliding breech, {{in addition to}} either monobloc (made from a single forging) or <b>replaceable</b> <b>liner</b> construction of the barrel. The gun featured a spring-powered rammer that was cocked {{by means of the}} recoil of the gun being fired; this allowed the rammer to load the gun at any elevation. 169 of the guns were completed, with 68 being land-based. One shortcoming of the gun was that it had a service life of only 350-400 effective full charges, {{as a result of the}} high muzzle velocity.|$|E

25|$|Jaw crushers {{are heavy}} duty {{machines}} and hence {{need to be}} robustly constructed. The outer frame is generally made of cast iron or steel. The jaws themselves are usually constructed from cast steel. They are fitted with <b>replaceable</b> <b>liners</b> which are made of manganese steel, or Ni-hard (a Ni-Cr alloyed cast iron). Jaw crushers are usually constructed in sections to ease the process transportation {{if they are to}} be taken underground for carrying out the operations.|$|R
50|$|Brakes: drum, all outboard, {{very light}} pedal {{pressure}} despite no power assistance. On later models, cast aluminium alloy brake drums with <b>replaceable</b> iron <b>liners</b> pinned in place, later cars' drums finned. The open centre rims bolted to ears {{on the periphery}} of the drums.|$|R
40|$|Conceptual {{tank with}} <b>replaceable</b> <b>liner</b> holds liquid {{propellant}} and {{is suitable for}} reuse in spacecraft propulsion systems. Main components are: composite outer shell for containment of pressure, replaceable membrane liner, and foam-filled honeycomb sandwich bonded to inside of tank to insulate and stabilize wall of tank. Concept maximizes potential of filament-wound composite pressure shells with strength-to-density ratios five times those of comparable aluminum shells. Reduction in weight as much as 50 percent...|$|E
40|$|Proposed {{apparatus}} {{cuts and}} polishes specimens while preventing contamination of outside environment or of subsequent specimens processed in it. Designed {{for use in}} zero gravity but also includes features useful in cutting and polishing of toxic or otherwise hazardous materials on Earth. Includes remote manipulator for handling specimens, cutting and polishing wire, inlets for gas and liquid, and outlets for waste liquid and gas. <b>Replaceable</b> plastic <b>liner</b> surrounds working space...|$|R
5000|$|In retrospect the car {{has been}} seen {{as one of the most}} {{technically}} advanced cars of its time. It had a four-cylinder in-line engine with 3.6 litres of displacement, incorporating an aluminium cylinder head with <b>replaceable</b> cylinder <b>liners</b> (eingepressten Laufbuchsen). It developed a maximum of [...] at 2200 rpm, which was transmitted to the rear wheels, using a four-speed transmission. Claimed top speed was 95 km/h (59 mph).|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{constructed}} around a monobloc cylinder and crankcase casting. Unusually, this {{was available in}} either cast iron or aluminium alloy. The cylinders were <b>replaceable</b> wet <b>liners,</b> with pumped water cooling. Valves were single OHV exhaust and inlet valves. Seven bearings with cross-bolted caps supported the nitrided crankshaft. The fuel injection system was direct, into a toroidal combustion chamber within the aluminium pistons. Supercharging was by a Roots blower driven at twice crankshaft speed, for a boost pressure of 8 psi.|$|R
5000|$|The {{full-scale}} IsaMills allowed MIM {{to refine}} the mill design to allow improved ease of maintenance. For example, the shell design was changed {{to allow it to}} split along the horizontal center-line (see Figure 5). This was done to allow the use of a <b>replaceable</b> slip-in <b>liner,</b> avoiding the need for the shell to be sent away for cold rubber lining and the need to have a stock of spare, lined shells. Also, the direction of flow of feed through the mill was reversed, because most of the disk wear occurred at the feed end, which was initially at the drive end of the mill. By changing the feed end to that opposite the drive end, the disks that required most frequent replacement were the first that were removed from the shaft rather than the last (see Figure 6 and Figure 7). [...] While the IsaMills at Mount Isa were operated using screened copper smelter reverberatory furnace slag as the grinding medium, those at McArthur River used screened primary grinding mill fines as the grinding medium for the first seven years of their operation and, in 2004, switched to using screened river sand.|$|R
40|$|In the {{preferred}} {{embodiment of the}} promoted combusiton chamber disclosed herein, a thick-walled tubular body {{that is capable of}} withstanding extreme pressures is arranged with removable upper and lower end closures to provide access to the chamber for dependently supporting a test sample of a material being evaluated in the chamber. To facilitate the real-time analysis of a test sample, several pressure-tight viewing ports capable of withstanding the simulated environmental conditions are arranged in the walls of the tubular body for observing the test sample {{during the course of the}} test. A replaceable heat-resistant tubular member and <b>replaceable</b> flame-resistant internal <b>liners</b> are arranged to be fitted inside of the chamber for protecting the interior wall surfaces of the combustion chamber during the evaluation tests. Inlet and outlet ports are provided for admitting high-pressure gases into the chamber as needed for performing dynamic analyses of the test sample during the course of an evaluation test...|$|R
