5|$|The {{velocity}} {{with which}} the university sped through its change into a major <b>research</b> <b>institution</b> was astounding. By {{the end of the}} 1950s, Syracuse ranked twelfth nationally in terms of the amount of its sponsored research, and it had over four hundred professors and graduate students engaging in that investigation.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Syracuse University {{began to}} {{transform}} {{into a major}} <b>research</b> <b>institution.</b> Enrollment increased {{in the four years}} after the war due to the G.I. Bill, which paid tuition, room, board, and a small allowance for veterans returning from World War II. In 1946, SU admitted 9,464 freshmen, nearly four times greater than the previous incoming class. Branch campuses were established in Endicott, New York and Utica, New York.|$|E

5|$|Joseph M. Pettit became {{president}} of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1972. During his 14-year tenure as president, Pettit was credited with turning Georgia Tech into a top-flight <b>research</b> <b>institution.</b> Pettit has also received credit for shifting Georgia Tech back to its roots with regards to providing assistance with economic development within the state of Georgia. In the decades known for the Vietnam War and the launch of Sputnik, research at Georgia Tech and the Georgia Tech Research Institute had become so tied with NASA and the Department of Defense that local industrial development had been largely forgotten.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the co-operative {{relationships that}} public <b>research</b> <b>institutions</b> in Germany have developed with manufacturing firms {{and with each}} other. We find that collaboration with firms is highly concentrated on regional partners. <b>Research</b> <b>institutions</b> contribute significantly to innovation processes in the respective regions by absorbing knowledge from beyond the region and making it available to local companies. In respect of co-operation between public <b>research</b> <b>institutions</b> themselves, we find that spatial proximity still matters, but to a lesser degree. ...|$|R

40|$|Present paper {{describes}} a measurement model {{that allows us}} a complete and flexible benchmarking among different <b>research</b> <b>institutions</b> (universities and <b>research</b> centres). The completeness of comparison comes out {{from the use of}} indicators which concern the main measurement dimensions of research, while the flexibility rises from the possibility to customize the evaluation methods designing new indicators. The model is made up of quantitative and simple measures and performance indicators that work well for all <b>research</b> <b>institutions.</b> It is organized into three measurement levels. These helps us to identify best practices as regards both particular results and overall performances of institutions. The model has been implemented in five Italian <b>research</b> <b>institutions.</b> Implementation proves that measurement model is a complete, simple and useful tool for <b>research</b> <b>institutions</b> performance benchmarking...|$|R
5000|$|In {{modern times}} many academies have {{pressured}} researchers at publicly funded universities and <b>research</b> <b>institutions</b> {{to engage in}} a mix of sharing research and making some technological developments proprietary. [...] Some research products have the potential to generate commercial revenue, and in hope of capitalizing on these products, many <b>research</b> <b>institutions</b> withhold information and technology which otherwise would lead to overall scientific advancement if other <b>research</b> <b>institutions</b> had access to these resources. It is difficult to predict the potential payouts of technology or to assess the costs of withholding it, but there is general agreement that the benefit to any single institution of holding technology is not as great as the cost of withholding it from all other <b>research</b> <b>institutions.</b>|$|R
