50|$|Site-directed {{mutagenesis}} of EAS {{has given}} {{insights into the}} specific structural changes responsible for self-assembly of monomers into rodlets and subsequent formation of amphipathic monolayer in hydrophobic:hydrophilic interfaces. Kwan et al. (2008) reported that the long hydrophobic Cys3-Cys4 loop is not required for <b>rodlet</b> assembly because its deletion {{does not affect the}} folding and physical properties of the monomeric protein, neither the morphology of the polymeric <b>rodlet</b> form. Instead, a region of the short Cys7-Cys8 loop, containing mainly uncharged polar residues, {{has been found to be}} critical for <b>rodlet</b> assembly.|$|E

50|$|Characterization of EAS {{secondary}} elements {{involved in}} <b>rodlet</b> assembly have given {{insights into the}} mechanism behind class I hydrophobins self-assembly, but important structural differences with DewA, another class I hydrophobin, suggest that the mechanisms driving <b>rodlet</b> assembly vary among different types of hydrophobins. Like EAS, DewA also has a β-barrel core structure, but it differs significantly from it because of its considerable content of helical secondary elements. A unique feature of DewA is its capacity to exist as two types of conformers in solution, both able to form <b>rodlet</b> assemblies but at different rates. Despite these differences in structural and self-assembly mechanisms, both EAS and DewA form robust fibrillar monolayers, meaning that there must exist several pathways, protein sequences and tertiary conformations able to self-assemble into amphipathic monolayers. Further characterisation of both EAS and DewA and their <b>rodlet</b> self-assembly mechanisms will open up opportunities for rational design of hydrophobins with novel biotechnological applications.|$|E

In cross section, the angular cristae have either triangular or rhomboid profiles which {{are surrounded by}} a hexagonal array of electron-dense dots. In longitudinal section, these mitochondria exhibit both thick and thin parallel lines, which represent cristae and filaments, respectively. It is postulated that the matrix of the prismatic-type mitochondria is packed with <b>rodlets</b> composed of an electron-dense core and a less dense shell. Close packing of these <b>rodlets</b> results in the regular hexagonal dot array. Deletion of fascicles of 3 or 4 <b>rodlets</b> results in spaces with triangular or rectangular cross sections.

50|$|There {{is special}} {{interest}} in understanding the mechanism underlying class I monomers self-assembly that leads to formation of tough, ordered amphipathic <b>rodlet</b> monolayers, due to their intrinsic properties and due to substantial information available from several characterisation studies of the class I hydrophobins EAS and DewA. These mechanisms have been greatly studied by targeted mutagenesis {{in an effort to}} identify the key amino acid sequence regions driving <b>rodlet</b> self-assembly.A model for the monomeric form of EAS was proposed by Kwan et al. (2006) from structural data obtained from NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction experiments that indicated the presence of four-stranded, antiparallel β-barrel core structure in EAS that allows monomer linking through backbone H-bonding. There are secondary elements around this β-barrel core like the Cys3-Cys4 and Cys7-Cys8 loops. This model is consistent with the amyloid-like structure that class I rodlets form, in which the β-strands are oriented perpendicular to the cross-β scaffold axis of the fibre.|$|E

The purified <b>rodlet</b> layer was 15 to 30 nm thick and accounted for approximately 10 % of the original wall weight. The pattern of <b>rodlet</b> patches, as revealed by electron microscopy of freeze-etched preparations of the isolated layer, was {{essentially the same as}} that observed on the intact microconidial wall.

40|$|Streptomycetes form {{hydrophobic}} aerial hyphae {{that eventually}} septate into hydrophobic spores. Both aerial hyphae and spores possess a typical surface layer called the <b>rodlet</b> layer. We present here evidence that <b>rodlet</b> formation is conserved in the streptomycetes. The {{formation of the}} <b>rodlet</b> layer {{is the result of}} the interplay between rodlins and chaplins. A strain of Streptomyces coelicolor in which the rodlin genes rdlA and/or rdlB were deleted no longer formed the <b>rodlet</b> layer. Instead, these surfaces were decorated with fine fibrils. Deletion of all eight chaplin genes (strain ΔchpABCDEFGH) resulted in the absence of the <b>rodlet</b> layer as well as the fibrils at surfaces of aerial hyphae and spores. Apart from coating these surfaces, chaplins are involved in the escape of hyphae into the air, as was shown by the strong reduction in the number of aerial hyphae in the ΔchpABCDEFGH strain. The decrease in the number of aerial hyphae correlated with a lower expression of the rdl genes in the colony. Yet, expression per aerial hypha was similar to that in the wild-type strain, indicating that expression of the rdl genes is initiated after the hypha has sensed that it has grown into the air. ...|$|E

After the irradiation, the rod was subjected to several PIE measurements, including radiochemical analysis. Element concentrations and radial distributions in the <b>rodlet,</b> multiplication factors and distributions within the carrier assembly of burnup and power were calculated.

40|$|International audienceWe have {{investigated}} the self-assembling properties of the class I hydrophobin Vmh 2 isolated from the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus. Five different hydrophobin self assembled samples including monolayers, bilayers, and <b>rodlets</b> have been prepared by Langmuir technique and studied at the nanoscale. Local wettability and visco-elasticity of the different hydrophobins samples were obtained from atomic force spectroscopy experiments in dynamic mode performed at different, controlled relative humidity (RH) values. It was found that hydrophobins assembled either in <b>rodlets</b> or in bilayer films, display similar hydropathicity and viscoelasticity {{in contrast to the}} case of monolayers, whose hydropathicity and viscoelasticity depend on the adopted preparation method (Langmuir−Blodgett or Langmuir−Schaeffer). The comparison with monolayers properties evidences a rearrangement of the bilayers adsorbed onto solid substrates. It is shown that this rearrangement leads to the formation of a stable hydrophobic film, and that the <b>rodlets</b> structure consists in fragments of restructured proteins bilayers. Our results support the hypothesis that the observed variations in the viscoelastic properties could be ascribed to the localization of the large flexible loop, typical of Class I hydrophobins which appears free at the air interface for LB monolayers but not for the other samples. These findings should now serve future developments and applications of hydrophobin films beyond the archetypal monolayer...|$|R
40|$|The {{shape and}} {{integrity}} of fungal cells {{is dependent on the}} skeletal polysaccharides in their cell walls of which β(1, 3) -glucan and chitin are of principle importance. The human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans has four genes, CHS 1, CHS 2, CHS 3 and CHS 8, which encode chitin synthase isoenzymes with different biochemical properties and physiological functions. Analysis of the morphology of chitin in cell wall ghosts revealed two distinct forms of chitin microfibrils: short microcrystalline <b>rodlets</b> that comprised the bulk of the cell wall; and a network of longer interlaced microfibrils in the bud scars and primary septa. Analysis of chitin ghosts of chs mutant strains by shadow-cast transmission electron microscopy showed that the long-chitin microfibrils were absent in chs 8 mutants and the short-chitin <b>rodlets</b> were absent in chs 3 mutants. The inferred site of chitin microfibril synthesis of these Chs enzymes was corroborated by their localization determined in Chsp–YFP-expressing strains. These results suggest that Chs 8 p synthesizes the long-chitin microfibrils, and Chs 3 p synthesizes the short-chitin <b>rodlets</b> at the same cellular location. Therefore the architecture of the chitin skeleton of C. albicans is shaped by the action of more than one chitin synthase at the site of cell wall synthesis...|$|R

Fish mast cells also known as eosinophilic granule cells, are morphologically and functionally similar to their mammalian counterparts. Acute tissue damage causes mast cells degranulation and the release of mediators of inflammation, whereas, an increase in the number of these cells is usually found in chronically inflamed tissues. <b>Rodlet</b> cells, however, are exclusive to fish and are characterized by a distinct cell cortex and conspicuous inclusions, called rodlets, which accounts for their name.
