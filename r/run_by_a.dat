At school he became interested in the principles of electricity and all related matters.|$|E
5|$|Reading has {{had some}} degree of local {{government}} autonomy since 1253, when the local merchant guild was granted a royal charter. Since then, the town has been <b>run</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> borough corporation, as a county borough, and as a district of Berkshire. The Borough of Reading became a unitary authority area in 1998, when Berkshire County Council was abolished under the Banham Review, and is now responsible for all aspects of local government within the borough.|$|E

5|$|The {{personal}} {{reign of}} the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots (1561–67) eventually ended in civil war, deposition, imprisonment and execution in England. Her infant son James VI was crowned King of Scots in 1567. He was brought up as a Protestant, while the country was <b>run</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> series of regents. After he asserted his personal rule from 1583 he favoured doctrinal Calvinism, but also episcopacy.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 35 {{individuals}} who have served as mayor. Joshua Bean, elected in 1850, was the first mayor of the city. Edwin M. Capps, who served as mayor in the late 1800s and early 1900s, {{is the only person}} who served two non-consecutive terms. From 1852 to 1888, the city was <b>run</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Board of Trustees and there was no elected mayor. However, the president of the board was called mayor as a courtesy.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was <b>run</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E
5|$|Each {{county is}} <b>run</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> commissioners' court, {{consisting}} of four elected commissioners (one {{from each of}} four precincts drawn based on population) and a county judge elected from all the voters of the county. In smaller counties, the county judge actually does perform judicial duties, but in larger counties, the judge's role is limited to serving on the commissioners' court. Certain officials, such as the sheriff and tax collector, are elected separately by the voters, but the commissioners' court determines their office budgets, and sets overall county policy. All county elections are partisan; the one exception is {{the board of trustees}} of the Dallas County department of education (the Harris County trustees were elected on a nonpartisan basis until 1984).|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's first {{policy toward}} Scotland was {{to oppose the}} French {{presence}} there. She feared that the French planned to invade England and put Mary, Queen of Scots, who was {{considered by many to}} be the heir to the English crown, on the throne. Elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into Scotland to aid the Protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting Treaty of Edinburgh of July 1560 removed the French threat in the north. When Mary returned to Scotland in 1561 to take up the reins of power, the country had an established Protestant church and was <b>run</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> council of Protestant nobles supported by Elizabeth. Mary refused to ratify the treaty.|$|E

50|$|Church {{government}} in the congregation was <b>run</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> executive congregation council, the presbytery assemblies was <b>run</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> executive presbytery council, the regional synod was <b>run</b> <b>by</b> executive regional synod council and the synod was <b>run</b> <b>by</b> executive synod council. This kind of organisation was acknowledged as the presbyterial-Synodal system. What was unique of GKI Presbyterial-Synodal is that, each form of GKI church organisation has its own council as servant-leaders, not a mere executive board.|$|R
5|$|He went to Primary School in St. Annes Primary School, Navan. Brosnan's father {{abandoned}} the family when Pierce was an infant.

5|$|His {{platform}} would {{consist of}} the main points of leading the city out of debt, assuring the completion of city projects that were in progress before introducing news ones, and again, ensuring that utilities were available to everyone and were of high quality. He had also expressed desire to amalgamate the existing city of Edmonton {{with the city of}} Strathcona, which was divided from Edmonton by the North Saskatchewan River, situated on the south. Though former councillor William Harold Clark was urged to <b>run</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> group of citizens, Armstrong would be the only nominated mayoral candidate when nomination deadline day came, and thus he was acclaimed mayor; the first occurrence since Kenneth W. MacKenzie was acclaimed in 1900. Amongst his supporters for his candidacy were outgoing mayor Robert Lee and former mayor Charles May.|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} parts of the United States, {{government}} and laws are also <b>run</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Federally, Seattle is part of Washington's 7th congressional district, represented by Democrat Pramila Jayapal, the first Indian American woman elected to Congress. City Councilmember Tim Burgess was appointed mayor on September 18, 2017, and will serve until the certification of the 2017 mayoral election results in November.|$|E
