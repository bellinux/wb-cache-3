50|$|To {{deal with}} all these early sewing problems, taping of seams was developed. The tape is a strong nylon cloth with a very thin but solid {{waterproof}} <b>rubber</b> <b>backing.</b> The tape is applied across the seam and bonded either with a chemical solvent or with a hot rolling heat-sealer to melt the tape into the neoprene.|$|R
50|$|The winning 8 hp Panhard et Levassor of Mayade {{had been}} {{extensively}} upgraded for 1896, using their first four-cylinder engine, doubling the horsepower from the 1895 model.

The brakes were a spoon-lever pressing on the solid <b>rubber</b> <b>back</b> tyre plus a belt that tightened onto a drum on the transmission.|$|R

5000|$|The major {{advantage}} a masthead sloop {{has over}} a fractional one, {{is that the}} jib is larger. Since the jib has no mast {{in front of it}} to cause turbulent airflow over it, it is considered much more efficient than the main, especially for sailing up wind. Also, since the fore stay is attached {{to the top of the}} mast, it pulls directly against the <b>back</b> <b>stay.</b> Tightening the <b>back</b> <b>stay,</b> then, increases the tension on the fore stay. This is useful because the jib needs considerable fore stay tension to set well. This need increases in direct proportion to the wind speed and jib size. Increasing the tension on the <b>back</b> <b>stay</b> does not tend to bend the mast, as it would on a fractional sloop. It puts the mast in compression instead. For this reason the mast on a mast head rig has a thicker section at the top to stand this load.|$|R
50|$|A {{rubber-like}} backing may {{be placed}} on each hold {{in an effort to}} prevent the holds from spinning. This technique has had mixed success, as eventually the <b>rubber</b> <b>backing</b> begins to peel away from the wall, providing a similar unintended handhold as the chipped resin might. The softer mixture is more durable than a brittle resin, but with uneven climbing walls and overtightening these holds develop slow cracks that eventually render the hold useless.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike the sit-up, in {{a proper}} crunch, the lower <b>back</b> <b>stays</b> on the floor. This is said by {{scientific}} literature to eliminate any involvement by the hip flexors, and make the crunch an effective isolation exercise for the abdominals.|$|R
50|$|The paper {{passes through}} rollers in the fuser assembly, where {{temperatures}} up to 200 C and pressure {{are used to}} permanently bond the toner to the paper. One roller is usually a hollow tube (heat roller) {{and the other is}} a <b>rubber</b> <b>backed</b> roller (pressure roller). A radiant heat lamp is suspended in the centre of the hollow tube, and its infrared energy uniformly heats the roller from the inside. For proper bonding of the toner, the fuser roller must be uniformly hot.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the bridges is complex. Each of the two decks is {{supported}} by inclined outward-leaning pylons. The decks are suspended from fans of slender steel rods called deck stays—there are 180 on each deck, made up of over 4 km of cable—and are held in position by other rods called <b>back</b> <b>stays.</b> Because the pylons lean the <b>back</b> <b>stays</b> are under tension. The deck is secured in place by steel collars fitted around (although not supported by) the pillars of the railway bridge; the collars are themselves attached to the bridge's foundations by tie-down rods. The entire structure is thus {{held in place by}} exploiting the tensions between the pylons and the various stay rods and struts.|$|R

50|$|Natural rubber is an elastomer, {{also known}} as tree gum, India rubber, and caoutchouc, which comes from the rubber tree in {{tropical}} regions. Christopher Columbus was {{the one of the}} first Europeans to bring news of this odd substance back to Europe, but he {{was not the only one}} to report it. Around 1736, a French astronomer recalled how Amerindians used rubber to waterproof shoes and cloaks. He brought several samples of <b>rubber</b> <b>back</b> to France. <b>Rubber</b> was used as an eraser by scientist Joseph Priestley in England.|$|R

5000|$|Gomusin are a {{traditional}} type of Korean women's shoe. The term [...] "Gomusin" [...] {{is also used}} as a social designation; in this sense it refers to young Korean women who are waiting for their boyfriends to return from the compulsory, two-year service in the South Korean army. Its origin comes from gomsin, which means [...] "wear the <b>rubbers</b> <b>back</b> to front". The word is an abbreviation of Gomusin. Since all Korean men are obliged {{to serve in the}} army, it is common to find gomsin among Korean women who are between twenty and thirty years old.|$|R

5000|$|The Seri Wawasan Bridge is a {{longitudinally}} asymmetric cable‐stayed box-girder {{bridge with}} a inverted-Y shape concrete/steel pylon 96m high. The main span, 165m long, {{is supported by}} 30 pairs of forward stay cables, anchored on the 75° forward‐inclined pylon and on the outer edges of the bridge deck, arranged in a fan shape pattern from the side elevation. To counter balance these front stays, a combination of 21 pairs of cable backstays and structural steel tie back was used. The <b>back</b> <b>stay</b> anchored at the (next-) highest point of the pylon is anchored at the curved backstay anchorage point (next-) nearest to the pylon, creating a crisscross‐over pattern from the side elevation, which adds to the aesthetic of the bridge. The overall complexity of the <b>back</b> <b>stay</b> tie <b>back</b> structure, however, may be aesthetically distracting. [...] The inclined concrete pylon and the backstays are anchored into bore piled foundation off the roadway in precinct 8.|$|R

The Panhard had been extensively upgraded for 1896, using their first four-cylinder engine which provided double the horsepower of the 1895 model. It was equipped with tiller steering and candle lamps. The brakes were a spoon-lever pressing on the solid <b>rubber</b> <b>back</b> tyre plus a belt that tightened onto a drum on the transmission.

40|$|Acoustoelasticity is a {{promising}} method for the {{in situ analysis}} of both applied and residual stresses. The object of this investigation {{is to establish a}} technique for scanned shear wave measurements so as to determine the individual components of an inhomogeneous stress state and their directions. A computer-controlled scanning system with a dry contact <b>rubber</b> <b>backed</b> transducer has been developed which provides complete automation of scanning and data reduction. The theory of acoustoelasticity for anisotropic material has been developed using perturbation techniques. The experimental results on rolled aluminum plates confirm that, to a reasonable approximation, the effects of material anisotropy and stresses can be uncoupled and the needed stress information thus derived...|$|R

25|$|Stays {{evolved in}} the 18th century when {{whalebone}} was used more, {{and there was more}} boning used in the garment. The shape of the stays changed as well.

The straps of the stays were generally attached in the back and tied at the front sides.|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} of organic compounds from textile floor coverings was studied {{in a climate}} test chamber under static conditions (zero air exchange) {{in order to test}} the parameters which influence such chamber experiments, i. e. the temperature, the humidity and the adsorption on the walls. While depending on the volatility and the polarity of the compound, the equilibrium concentrations increase in part substantially with increasing temperature, the humidity has little impact on the observed concentrations. The chamber walls represent an important sink for polar and less volatile compounds, although this sink does not influence the equilibrium concentrations. Ten textile floor coverings have been tested (7 of which had a polyamide pile and a styrene-butadiene <b>rubber</b> <b>backing).</b> Ninety-nine compounds have been identified. The equilibrium concentrations of 20 compounds have been determined. (Abstract truncated...|$|R
