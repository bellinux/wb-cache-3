60|$|And <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{he flung}} it open, took a steady aim at {{something}} outside, and fired.|$|E
60|$|No one replied, and Peggy, <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> met {{the young}} outlaw, who {{appeared}} on the threshold with stern, set face.|$|E
60|$|<b>Rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{in search}} of the cause of this clamor, I found it to be related to my wife's {{innocent}} request.|$|E
60|$|Mitchener, {{revolver}} in hand, <b>rushes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and locks}} it. Balsquith hides under the table.|$|R
60|$|He <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and tore}} it open. There was a startled exclamation from the {{darkness}} outside.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} the jingle of bells was heard outside, and Mr Kennedy <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> again.|$|R
60|$|The cook, {{incapable}} of speech, raised a trembling hand {{and pointed to}} the galley. The skipper started, and, <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> drew it hastily back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens!" [...] cried Robert, <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{with his}} half-filled teacup in his hand. [...] "This is too much. Here is an iron cage on a trolly {{with a great}} ramping tiger, and the whole village with their mouths open." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then may the blight of hell rest {{upon you}} both!" [...] said the Countess, <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> But she returned. [...] "Mr. Thwaite," [...] she said, [...] "I will trouble you {{at once to}} leave the house, and never more to return to it." ...|$|E
60|$|SHE. Dearest boy, I {{knew you}} would. I--Sh! [she <b>rushes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{and holds it}} ajar, {{listening}} breathlessly].|$|R
60|$|It was evening--so {{he was at}} home; and by {{a species}} of divination he jumped up and <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> himself.|$|R
60|$|Dredlinton had <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> shaken <b>the</b> handle violently, {{only to find}} it locked. He pommelled {{with his}} fists upon the panels.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop that, you!" [...] {{cried the}} oldest Rover, and then, <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> he flung {{it open and}} gave a shove to what was beyond. This was a short {{step-ladder}} upon which Larkspur and several others were standing, and over the ladder went with a crash, sending the hazers {{to the floor of}} the hallway in a heap.|$|E
6000|$|JAMES motions {{with his}} hand. At that sign of hardness, FALDER [...] becomes rigid. Then, turning, {{he goes out}} quietly in the [...] detective's grip. JAMES follows, stiff and erect. SWEEDLE, [...] <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with open mouth, pursues them through the [...] outer office into the corridor. When they have all {{disappeared}} [...] COKESON spins completely round and makes a rush for the outer [...] office.|$|E
60|$|She {{seems to}} have behaved with great {{presence}} of mind. She snatched up the sealed bag of letters that was waiting {{to go on to}} Urshot, and rushed out of the door at once. Almost simultaneously Mr. Skelmersdale himself appeared down the village, gripping a watering-pot by the spout, and very white in the face. And, of course, in a moment or so every one in the village was <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> or window.|$|E
6000|$|... [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN goes out. LORD GORING <b>rushes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> drawing-room, when MRS. CHEVELEY comes out, looking radiant {{and much}} amused.] ...|$|R
50|$|The voice {{heard on}} the radio {{broadcast}} is Moe; Shemp Howard accidentally cut his hand on the lock when he <b>rushes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in an effort to open it.|$|R
60|$|There was a <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and a thundering clatter as {{the heavy}} blows of the sledge-hammers {{fell on the}} wood; while another party began an assault upon <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> winding-engine house.|$|R
60|$|In reply, {{they dropped}} the lamp, {{and made a}} sudden rush at him. He fired his pistol hastily in the {{darkness}} but, in an instant, the Afghans were upon him. The first man he cut down, but he was knocked over by the rush of the others. Two fell upon him; but Yossouf bounded upon them like a tiger, and buried his knife to the hilt in their backs, in quick succession. The last of the party--without staying {{to see what was}} the fate of his friends--at once took to his heels and, <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> leading to the street, made his escape.|$|E
60|$|Disgusted at this {{exhibition}} of the most confirmed trait of the squatter's character, I was {{in the act of}} moving from him, when a loud shout arose around the building, and the flashes and reports of three or four rifles were heard. <b>Rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> I was in time to hear the tramp of men, who {{seemed to me to be}} pushing forward in all directions; and the crack of the rifle was occasionally heard, apparently retiring toward the woods. Men called to each other, in the excitement of a chase and conflict; but I could gain no information, the body of darkness which had settled on the place having completely hidden everything from view, at any distance.|$|E
6000|$|At last, {{she took}} them {{completely}} by surprise, suddenly launching {{herself on the}} bed, and plunging her face into {{the midst of the}} black bristles; then, leaping down, and <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> as if expecting to be caught. So violent a proceeding was almost more than Arthur could bear, and Violet, rising to smooth the coverings, began to preach gentleness; but shaken as he was, he was too much gratified to permit the reproof, smiled, and held up a bunch of grapes to invite the little maid back. But this was an offence; she put her hands behind her, and, with a dignified gesture, announced, 'I do not give kisses for grapes. I did it because Johnnie will not let me alone, and said I was unkind.' ...|$|E
60|$|The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned {{suddenly}} and was gone. Morel <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but was too late. He returned, pale under his pit-dirt with fury. But now {{his wife was}} fully roused.|$|R
60|$|The Sage {{broke off}} abruptly, {{for the young}} man had <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and out into the passage. Through <b>the</b> open <b>door</b> he could hear him crying passionately <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waiter <b>to</b> bring back his clubs.|$|R
6000|$|... "The men {{had just}} {{finished}} and were getting up from the table, and I knew the moment was coming fast, when we heard a sudden shout outside. My heart gave a bound, as they <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> captain fired a shot at Mr. Donald, {{just as he was}} getting up; and as he ran out, shouted to me: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What can it be?" [...] cried Fred, leaping out of bed, and <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> As {{he threw}} it open, {{there was a}} roar like the sudden {{discharge}} of artillery, {{and at the same}} moment a huge mass of rock, many tons in weight, bounded close past the door, went crashing through a wooden shed {{as if it had been}} a sheet of paper, and, carrying shrubs and small trees along with it, finally found a resting-place at the bottom of the glen. The huge mass had fallen from the cliffs above, and fortunately swept through the hamlet without doing further damage. It was followed by a shower of smaller stones, some of which struck and shook the house, and produced a commotion that caused even Grant to wake up and run out in alarm.|$|E
60|$|But Florence bloomed there, {{like the}} king's fair {{daughter}} in the story. Her books, her music, and her daily teachers, were her only real companions, Susan Nipper and Diogenes excepted: of whom the former, in her attendance on the studies of her young mistress, began to grow quite learned herself, while the latter, softened possibly by the same influences, would lay his head upon the window-ledge, and placidly open and shut his eyes upon the street, all through a summer morning; sometimes pricking up {{his head to look}} with great significance after some noisy dog in a cart, who was barking his way along, and sometimes, with an exasperated and unaccountable recollection of his supposed enemy in the neighbourhood, <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> whence, after a deafening disturbance, he would come jogging back with a ridiculous complacency that belonged to him, and lay his jaw upon the window-ledge again, with the air of a dog who had done a public service.|$|E
60|$|Two {{days later}} Frank was awoke {{by a sudden}} yell. He leaped from his bed of boughs, seized his revolver, and <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> saw that a party of some twenty men were attacking Ammon Quatia's hut. The two guards {{stationed}} there had already been cut down. Frank shouted to his four guards and Ostik to follow him. The guards had been standing irresolute, not knowing what side to take, but {{the example of the}} young Englishman decided them. They fired their muskets into the knot of natives, and then charged sword in hand. Ostik drew the sword which he always carried and followed close to his master's heels. Frank did not fire until within two yards of the Ashantis. Then his revolver spoke out and six shots were discharged, each with deadly effect. Then, catching up a musket which had fallen from the hands of one of the men he had shot, he clubbed it and fell upon the surprised and already hesitating conspirators.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will they, by G----!" [...] said Barry, and he <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{which he}} banged open; finding no victim outside on whom to {{exercise}} his wrath--"let me catch 'em!" [...] and {{he returned to}} his position by the fire.|$|R
60|$|He {{was afraid}} of her--the small, severe woman with graying hair {{suddenly}} bursting out in such frenzy. The postman came running back, afraid something had happened. They saw his tipped cap over the short curtains. Mrs. Morel <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|Hereward {{uttered a}} cry of horror. If the wild Letts, even the Jomsburgers, had got in, all was lost. He <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> It was not yet burst: but a bench, swung by strong arms, was {{battering}} it in fast.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to say I frightened her--while we were talking in my room--quite unintentionally. She <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and ran out. I {{supposed}} {{she had gone to}} her bedroom; I had no idea she was in the grounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's Ed," [...] {{cried the}} old woman. [...] "He's {{on the way}} home. Heavens an' earth! There he is now!" [...] She turned and waved her hand out toward <b>the</b> road. They <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and looked where she pointed.|$|R
60|$|She <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> ask for help. James {{was in the}} hall, having waited there, expecting {{momentarily}} to {{hear his}} master tell him to show his visitor out. He began to utter exclamations of dismay at seeing his master's senseless figure.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{and called}} <b>to</b> her. From <b>the</b> farther {{end of the}} corridor, her voice reached him for the last time, repeating the last melancholy word: [...] "Good-bye." [...] No renewal of the miserable parting scene: no more of the heartache--Iris had ended it! ...|$|R
60|$|He let go o' Kumbo's arm, turned round twice, {{and then}} sat down 'eavy and fell fast asleep. <b>The</b> manager <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and looked out, {{but there was no}} signs of the boy, and he came back shaking his 'ead, and said that George 'ad been {{drinking}} agin.|$|R
60|$|The noise soon aroused {{the entire}} hotel, and the clerk, several bell-boys, and finally <b>the</b> proprietor, <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scene. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> was flung wide open.|$|R
