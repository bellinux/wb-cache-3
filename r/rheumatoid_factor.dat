40|$|<b>Rheumatoid</b> <b>factors</b> in the sera of {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis appear to be specifically directed against genetically determined "antigens" in human γ-globulin. At least eight <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>factors</b> of differing specificity exist; usually several are present in combination in the same serum. The different <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>factors</b> can be readily detected through their pattern of reactivity with anti-Rh antibodies from different individuals. <b>Rheumatoid</b> <b>factors</b> in diseases other than rheumatoid arthritis {{were found to have}} a more restricted specificity, contrasted to the broader reactivity of the <b>factors</b> in most <b>rheumatoid</b> arthritis sera. A specificity similar to that for incomplete antibodies was not demonstrated for the reaction of <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>factors</b> with aggregated γ-globulin or with γ-globulin to form the " 22 S complex.

500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of DPB requires {{analysis of the}} lungs and bronchiolar tissues, which can require a lung biopsy, or the more preferred high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs. The diagnostic criteria include severe inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles and lung tissue lesions that appear as nodules within the terminal and respiratory bronchioles in both lungs. The nodules in DPB appear as opaque lumps when viewed on X-rays of the lung, and can cause airway obstruction, which is evaluated by a pulmonary function test, or PFT. [...] Lung X-rays can also reveal dilation of the bronchiolar passages, another sign of DBP. HRCT scans often show blockages of some bronchiolar passages with mucus, which {{is referred to as}} the [...] "tree-in-bud" [...] pattern. [...] Hypoxemia, another sign of breathing difficulty, is revealed by measuring the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the blood, using a blood test called arterial blood gas. Other findings observed with DPB include the proliferation of lymphocytes (white blood cells that fight infection), neutrophils, and foamy histiocytes (tissue macrophages) in the lung lining. Bacteria such as H.influenzae and P.aeruginosa are also detectable, with the latter becoming more prominent as the disease progresses. The white blood, bacterial and other cellular content of the blood can be measured by taking a complete blood count (CBC). Elevated levels of IgG and IgA (classes of immunoglobulins) may be seen, as well as the presence of <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>factor</b> (an indicator of autoimmunity). Hemagglutination, a clumping of red blood cells in response to the presence of antibodies in the blood, may also occur. Neutrophils, beta-defensins, leukotrienes, and chemokines can also be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid injected then removed from the bronchiolar airways of individuals with DPB, for evaluation.|$|E

40|$|Studies were {{undertaken}} in man {{and in the}} rat comparing the effects of <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>factors</b> and immune antiglobulins on red cells sensitized with incomplete antibodies.

In contrast, rheumatoid macroglobulins, although capable of agglutinating Rh-sensitized red cells in vitro, did not modify their destruction in vivo. The failure of <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>factors</b> to function as antiglobulins in vivo appears to reflect their non-reactivity with sensitized cells in whole serum. It is suggested: (a) that the native (7 S) gamma globulins of plasma competitively inhibit <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>factors</b> from reacting with fixed antibody in the blood stream; (b) that if these macroglobulins do indeed have pathogenetic activity, this may be limited to body fluids of low protein content...|$|R

2500|$|The {{rheumatoid}} nodule, {{which is}} {{sometimes in the}} skin, {{is the most common}} non-joint feature and occurs in 30% of people who have RA. It is a type of inflammatory reaction known to pathologists as a [...] "necrotizing granuloma". The initial pathologic process in nodule formation is unknown but may be essentially the same as the synovitis, since similar structural features occur in both. The nodule has a central area of fibrinoid necrosis that may be fissured and which corresponds to the fibrin-rich necrotic material found in and around an affected synovial space. Surrounding the necrosis is a layer of palisading macrophages and fibroblasts, corresponding to the intimal layer in synovium and a cuff of connective tissue containing clusters of lymphocytes and plasma cells, corresponding to the subintimal zone in synovitis. The typical rheumatoid nodule may be a few millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter and is usually found over bony prominences, such as the elbow, the heel, the knuckles, or other areas that sustain repeated mechanical stress. Nodules are associated with a positive RF (<b>rheumatoid</b> <b>factor)</b> titer, ACPA, and severe erosive arthritis. Rarely, these can occur in internal organs or at diverse sites on the body.|$|E

Positive slide tests for <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>factors</b> were associated with hyperglobulinemia but not with severe infection. <b>Rheumatoid</b> <b>factors</b> have been demonstrated in a variety of diverse states of disease [1], and the association of these antibodies to globulin with in-fections of known and precise etiology has aroused particular attention [2, 3]. Although low titers of these antibodies have been found {{in a wide variety of}} diseases as well as in normal individuals [4], titers comparable to those seen in rheumatoid ar-thritis are rarely encountered.

40|$|The {{etiology}} of rheumatoid arthritis remains unknown.

These antibodies may belong to any class of immunoglobulins, and are termed IgG <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>factors</b> (IgG-RF), IgM <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>factors</b> (IgM-RF), etc. Self-associating IgG-RF form unique immune complexes in that these IgG molecules serve as both antigens and antibodies.
