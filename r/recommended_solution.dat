50|$|Many {{building}} codes require {{the presence of}} speakers in a secure room for emergency announcements. Although speakers are intended for creating sound, the speaker cone also responds to external sound and the coil generates a minute voltage characteristic of that sound. With proper sensing, that voltage {{can be converted to}} speech. Although it is possible to place a speaker masker next to the paging speaker the <b>recommended</b> <b>solution</b> is an optical isolator. It is essentially an audio diode; sound only goes one way.|$|E

Recorded files can be [...] "corrupt", such corruption can cause failures to the normal operation of the box. If the user changes channel on one receiver or uses Fast Forward and Rewind on one file this can cause video jumps in files that are being recorded.|$|E
50|$|The USRP N200 and USRP N210 are {{high-performance}} USRP {{devices that}} provide higher dynamic range and higher bandwidth than the bus series. Using a Gigabit Ethernet interface, the devices in the Networked Series can transfer up to 50 MS/s of complex, baseband samples to/from the host. This series uses a dual, 14-bit, 100 MS/S ADC and dual 16-bit, 400 MS/s DAC. This series {{also provides a}} MIMO expansion port {{which can be used}} to synchronize two devices from this series. This is the <b>recommended</b> <b>solution</b> for MIMO systems.|$|E

50|$|The Q {{failed to}} attract the {{attention}} of the British operators and as a result failed to find a market in the UK like that Fageol had found in the US. One of the reasons was the Q was prone to problems, the most worrying being that the carburettors on the petrol-engined models caught fire. The <b>recommended</b> <b>solution</b> was just as worrying… increasing the revs until the fire went out! However, the vehicle was just too revolutionary for the conservative-minded bus industry, with the result was that the Q did not obtain the popularity of the other AEC models so the project was dropped, last appearing in the 1937 catalogue.|$|E
50|$|The <b>recommended</b> <b>solution</b> to WEP {{security}} problems is {{to switch to}} WPA2. WPA was an intermediate solution for hardware that could not support WPA2. Both WPA and WPA2 are much more secure than WEP. To add support for WPA or WPA2, some old Wi-Fi access points might {{need to be replaced}} or have their firmware upgraded. WPA was designed as an interim software-implementable solution for WEP that could forestall immediate deployment of new hardware. However, TKIP (the basis of WPA) has reached the end of its designed lifetime, has been partially broken, and had been officially deprecated with the release of the 802.11-2012 standard.|$|E
50|$|The wing is a delta in {{the form}} of an {{equilateral}} triangle with a span of four body diameters. Wing section is a symmetric cylindrical arc with a relative thickness t/c of 4%. Leading and trailing edges of the wing should be rounded with a radius equal to 0.002 D. However, this specification is unclear. It is obvious that the specified radius can not be applied near the wingtips, or large deformations in the plan form of the wing would occur. In the past, this part of the specification was interpreted in different ways by model designers which led to small differences in shapes of the tested models. The <b>recommended</b> <b>solution</b> is to have the leading- and trailing-edge radii of 0.002 D at the theoretical root chord and to decrease the radii towards the wing tips proportionally to the local chord.|$|E

5000|$|According to scholar Nicholas Must, [...] "Marriage was, in the {{equations}} of Huguenot ministers... {{a means to}} avoid promiscuity and lechery. As a result of this, many sermons that dealt with marriage were also an opportunity to announce the dangers of illicit sex while, at the same time, offering a relatively positive appraisal of conjugal sex. For instance, Jean Mestrezat declares simply that marriage is the <b>recommended</b> <b>solution</b> for illicit sexuality, since God hates all impurities, especially paillardise immorality... In another sermon, Jean Daillé provides a close hermeneutical reading of paillardise in a sermon on 1 Corinthians 10:8 when he states that it includes [...] "all the species of this sin, {{that is to say}} all the faults of this nature, which are committed by any person, whether married or not, simple fornication as well as adultery"." [...] To the Huguenot, “simple fornication” is a [...] "grave sin".|$|E
5000|$|Camp frying pans {{often lack}} handles for easy packing, with the camp cook using a clamp-like device {{to pick up}} and move the pan. Camp frying pans are {{generally}} made out of very thin metal (though some campers do use cast iron pans for this purpose as well), so extra care must be taken to evenly cook the food, especially over the small-diameter flame of a portable stove. A [...] "round the clock" [...] technique, where the frying pan is moved repeatedly to expose different parts of its base to the flame, is the most commonly <b>recommended</b> <b>solution</b> to the problem, though it is also possible to use a flame diffuser to achieve the same effect. For campfire use, on the other hand, some camp cooks prefer a legged cast-iron pan called a [...] "spider", which is elevated to allow a small fire directly beneath it.|$|E
5000|$|Finale 2011 was {{released}} in June 2010 with additional Garritan Sounds, Alpha Notes (notation with note names inside), a new lyric entry window and other lyric enhancements, and, most notably, a reworking of staff, system, and page layout handling. In Finale versions before 2011, systems could be optimized to remove empty staves from them and also permit staves in a system to be positioned independently from other systems. Eliminating empty staves from systems with many staves (sometimes called French scoring) is a common notation practice used to economize (or optimize) {{the use of the}} page. Users needed to take caution while optimizing, because if measures with notes were moved into an optimized system, or notes were added to staves while viewing the score in Scroll View that had been optimized out, they could be omitted in the printed score. The <b>recommended</b> <b>solution</b> was to always optimize as the last step in the score editing process, immediately before printing.|$|E
