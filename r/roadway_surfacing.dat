5000|$|Work {{began in}} 2003 on the {{approaches}} in both {{states and the}} construction contract for the arch bridge was awarded in October 2004. The largest obstacle to the project was the river crossing. The bridge and the bypass were constructed by a consortium of different government agencies and contractors, among them the Federal Highway Administration, the Arizona Department of Transportation, and Nevada Department of Transportation, with RE Monks Construction and Vastco, Inc, constructing the Arizona Approach, Edward Kraemer & Sons, Inc, the Nevada Approach and Las Vegas Paving Corporation undertaking the <b>roadway</b> <b>surfacing</b> on both approaches. The bridge itself was built by Obayashi Corporation and PSM Construction USA, Inc., while Frehner Construction Company, Inc. was responsible for completing the final roadway installations. [...] A permit problem between Clark County and the subcontractor Casino Ready Mix arose in May 2006 over the operation of a concrete-batch plant for the project, and this caused a four-month delay.|$|E

40|$|The {{dependence}} on motor vehicle {{travel in the}} United States {{has led to an}} increase in the number of vehicle miles traveled each year and, therefore, an increase in the exposure to the risks associated with such travel. In order to significantly reduce the number of annual injuries and fatalities associated with motor vehicle crashes, there is a need for a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that are involved in these crashes. One approach to expanding the knowledge of crash safety is to focus on the role of weather in automobile crashes. Existing transportation safety research that has considered the effects of weather has been limited in scope: considering only one or two weather conditions or analyzing the effects on a macroscopic level. This research provides an interpretation of the factors that affect injury severity based upon the analysis of crashes that occurred on multiple weather-related <b>roadway</b> <b>surface</b> conditions. The effects of weather on the injury severity outcomes of drivers of passenger vehicles who were involved in single-vehicle crashes on dry, wet, and snow- or ice-covered <b>roadway</b> <b>surfaces</b> are identified in this study. The probability of injury severity was estimated using data collected from police crash reports on the state-maintained roads throughout Indiana during 2007 and 2008. Likelihood ratio tests determined that parameters were estimated differently by <b>roadway</b> <b>surface</b> condition, driver gender, and driver age. As a result, 12 separate severity models were estimated using the mixed logit model with random parameters. ^ This research provides a unique understanding of the factors that affect driver injury severities on ideal and adverse weather-related <b>roadway</b> <b>surface</b> conditions that will be beneficial to future transportation safety programs and designs. The average predicted probabilities for each injury severity outcome were determined for each driver group and weather-related <b>roadway</b> <b>surface</b> condition. Overall, adverse weather conditions increased the severe and no injury/PDO outcome probabilities, compared to dry surface conditions. The severe injury probabilities more than doubled in adverse conditions for female drivers and male drivers 45 years old and older. This study also identifies the increased risk of severe injury that male drivers under 45 years old experienced on average in dry surface crashes, compared to adverse surface crashes. Furthermore, several findings of this study support safety awareness and enforcement efforts already in effect (such as the importance of seatbelt use regardless of the weather-related <b>roadway</b> <b>surface</b> condition), while others have indicated additional areas of safety concern for specific driver groups. ...|$|R
30|$|Many strata control {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to support the roadways under complex conditions in China and other countries.

This method improves the physical and mechanical properties of rocks, and enhances the strength and integrity of rocks, such as various grouting techniques; (4) Stress relief. This strata control technique attempts to improve the stress states of rocks, and decrease the stresses in rocks surrounding roadways, such as various destressing mining and stress control methods; (5) Combinations.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper quantifies and models the impact of wet pavement surface and rainy weather conditions on driver perception-reaction times (PRTs), deceleration levels, and traffic signal change interval durations. A total of 648 stop-run records were collected as part of the research effort for a 72 km/h (45 mi/h) approach speed where participant drivers encountered a yellow indication initiation at different distances from the intersection. The participant drivers were randomly selected in different age groups (under 40 years old, 40 to 59 years old, and 60 years of age or older) and genders (female and male). Using the gathered data, statistical models for driver PRT and deceleration levels were developed, considering <b>roadway</b> <b>surface</b> and environmental parameters, driver attributes (age and gender), roadway grade, approaching speed, and time and distance to the intersection at the onset of yellow. Inclement weather yellow timings were then developed and summarized in lookup tables as a function of different factors (driver age/gender, roadway grade, speed limit, precipitation level, and <b>roadway</b> <b>surface</b> condition) to provide practical guidelines for the design of yellow signal timings in wet and rainy weather conditions. The results indicate that wet <b>roadway</b> <b>surface</b> conditions require a 5 percent increase in the change interval and that rainy conditions require a 10 percent or more increase in the duration of the change interval. These recommended change durations can also be integrated within the Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) initiative to provide customizable driver warnings prior to a transition to a red indication...|$|R

A wide variation of traffic volumes across different regions and variations of local conditions and scenarios present a great challenge for local agencies to determine suitable <b>roadway</b> <b>surface</b> types for local rural roads, especially considering constraints on transportation budgets. The primary objective {{of this research was}} developing specific guidelines to identify the most suitable <b>roadway</b> <b>surface</b> for a particular roadway section with given conditions. Surveys were carried out to determine the importance of factors affecting the selection of a <b>roadway</b> <b>surface</b> type, where were later used for guideline development. General guidelines were developed using the multi-criteria assessment method in order to fulfill the main objective. The main important factors in decision-making were identified as agency cost, safety, Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC), traffic volume, purpose of road usage, and public preference. Multi-criteria assessment method involves calculating the weights for the factors important in decision-making, the respective scaled values for each factor for paved surface and gravel surface, and eventually calculating the final score for paved and gravel surface type. Equations were formulated to carry out life cycle cost (LCC) analysis along with the present worth evaluation. The formulas provided flexibility to calculate agency cost by considering local variation. VOC was calculated for paved and gravel roads considering variations in speed of different classes of vehicles, gradient and horizontal curve of the road, and the conversion factor for cost on paved surface versus gravel surface. Safety analysis was carried out for local rural roads in Kansas for five years, from 2010 to 2014, using the Kansas Department of Transportation’s KCARS database. After calculating the EPDO crash rates on paved and gravel roads in Kansas, results showed that paved surfaces were in general safer than gravel surfaces, which was taken into consideration while calculating the scaled values for safety. The final score was calculated by multiplying the weights of each factor and their respective scaled values. <b>Roadway</b> <b>surface</b> type with higher score is the preferred alternative for a road section under consideration. A computer-based program was created as a user interface, using Visual Studio, to carry out all complex calculations for determining LCC and VOC considering local variations. The program also helped determine final total scores for paved and gravel roads by considering scaled values of all-important factors considered for conversion. Another approach using cost versus traffic volume showed that the break-even point for traffic volume decreased with an increased {{percentage of}} trucks and increased vehicle speeds. Thus, the developed guideline helps determine the best <b>roadway</b> <b>surface</b> type for any set of local conditions...|$|R

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of research effort has been undertaken attempting to identify and quantify sources of stormwater pollution. This research has identified approximately eight major sources of common stormwater pollutants within drainage basins. Each of these sources is described briefly in the following sections. 1. 1 Street Pavement Components of road surface degradation are common constituents of urban runoff. Studies conducted in Europe have indicated {{that as much as}} 0. 05 - 0. 10 inch of pavement surface is worn away from the roadway each year. The largest component of street pavement is the aggregate material itself, with additional smaller quantities originating from the asphalt binder, fillers and substances applied to the surface.
