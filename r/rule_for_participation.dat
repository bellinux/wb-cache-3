As a solution, the Estonian Chess Federation proposed Golubenko to apply for Estonian citizenship; this proposal was rejected by the Golubenko's family.

40|$|One crucial {{precondition}} {{for the overall}} achievement of the Kyoto Protocol by 2010 is {{the participation of the}} USA. According to political economy theory, big countries have the strongest incentives to provide global collective good provisions. Reality, however, does not seem to follow this logic, as the USA dropped out in The Hague (2000). One main argument for the USA to drop out was the risk of carbon leakage, i. e. the fact that investments would shift to big developing countries such as China and India. We apply the approaches of collective action theory by Olson (1965) and the Samaritan's Dilemma game by Buchanan (1975) to this problem. The policy recommendation on how to make the USA rejoin the agreement is that other countries should support the USA in its "tough" policy towards big developing countries, i. e. to define preselected <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>participation</b> and delegate the decision-making power to a neutral international institution such as the World Trade Organization. This initiative may both induce big developing countries to join the Kyoto Protocol and may also ensure that the USA will rejoin and that all Annex B countries will reach their stated target levels.

While it is recognized that teachers {{play an important role}} in facilitating learner collaboration online they may not have the necessary skills to do so successfully. Thus, a small scale professional development programme was set up and piloted by two distance universities. The aims were to develop teachers’ experience of online group work; to trial a set of pilot activities which would raise awareness of factors contributing to successful collaborative online activity; and to identify professional development needs in this area. This article reports on the hands-on experience of a group of 20 teachers, examines some of the competences that are needed to successfully collaborate in virtual environments, and presents the skills that teachers need to foster online collaborative learning in the virtual classroom. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected, examining the levels of participation among participants, the collaborative activity of two groups, and teacher perception of the collaboration which took place.

30|$|In {{the field}} of {{technology}} transfer between university and industry, we can highlight many critical elements, including geographical proximity and the information asymmetry. Collaborative partnerships with universities geographically nearby are useful in terms of “problem solving” especially for the transfer of tacit knowledge. The importance of proximity between university and industry—or the original source of knowledge and the point of use—is still an open question, knowledge being intangible while tacit knowledge, with greater value added, is not easily codifiable. In the process of innovation, geographical proximity assumes a critical role when the type of technological knowledge is fed by multiple knowledge sources (universities, research laboratories, companies); this is equally true because the tacit nature, unobservable, complex, and systemic, blocks the use of scientific knowledge transfer tools and formalized means of communication (telecommunication networks, publications, license/sales know-how, reverse engineering). In these circumstances, just a face-to-face interaction {{makes it possible to}} feed and exchange the potential applications of knowledge; the process of knowledge creation therefore needs a place identified as ba (Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995; Nonaka and Konno 1998), where there are participants and <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>participation</b> and knowledge is shared, created, and used within collaborative relationships. Knowledge divorced from the ba becomes information and as such can be notified individually as it is tangible, unlike the knowledge that is resident and intangible. The ba feeds the spiral process and is not necessarily a physical place but has a specific space-time dimension that identifies it. Indeed, the ba is a place where information is interpreted and assumes significance, validating Nietzsche’s intuition that emphasizes the absence of facts, leaving the field to only interpretation. A feature of the ba, however, is that it is an open space, even if it requires—conceptually—borders, where participants can come and go, a context, therefore, in constant evolution.|$|R
30|$|As Dougherty (2016) details, cycling {{through the}} abductive {{learning}} routines for institutional problem setting and solving begins with imagining a configuration of interdependencies among relational elements and rules {{that can produce}} the specific kind of collaboration needed to address a certain problem.

Leaders need to be appointed, perhaps a coalition with clear <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> IP, <b>participation,</b> and task forces to oversee particular processes. Evaluating digs into the hypothesized interdependencies to examine assumptions {{and figure out what}} works and not, and why and how. Over time, experiments generate insights into how to develop and deploy metrics about how well the collaboration is doing, update and revise the problem, arrive at joint decisions and agreements, and foster ongoing participation.

40|$|AbstractSince {{the launch}} of LA 21 in 1992, local governments in many {{countries}} have been seeking to improve sustainability. Various {{studies have been conducted}} in the past two decades. A brief review of the literature reveals general progress in citizen participation and a shift from the agenda-setting stage to action, including the Cities and Climate Change Initiative (CCCI). However, the difficulty of taking a three-dimensional (environmental, economic and social) sustainability approach is being experienced in many places. Local communities are therefore adapting sustainable development to their individual context. Some past studies have investigated what influences local sustainability performance; this includes such factors as institutional capacity and the availability of community networks and champions in the public, private, and voluntary sectors. Drawing on their findings, this paper examines in particular the workings and effects of community networks in targeting sustainable development at the local level; it looks at three examples of current action towards sustainability in Japanese cities, focusing on social capital networks and the role local government is playing in the process. Investigating quantitatively whether social capital accumulation through citizen participation does in fact {{make a difference in the}} progress towards sustainability, and also examining qualitatively how it is possible to generate and make the most of social capital networks towards the same end, this paper concludes that social capital accumulation can indeed make a difference to the level of sustainability that can be achieved, but that the types of governance and of networks available in communities also make a difference to LA 21 outcomes. There is an essential role for local government to play: that is to (1) create an environment in which citizens empower themselves by collaboratively making the <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>participation,</b> and (2) identify key individuals who connect the various networks and involve them in the development of sustainability strategies; thereby expediting the process of reaching the stage where local government and citizens share the same sustainability goals...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{systemic}} risk in multilateral netting payments systems. A four-period model is constructed {{to investigate the}} effects of random liquidity shocks. There are three different types of agents in this model: banks, the payments system operator, and the central bank. Banks pay one another via the payments system. The payments system operator sets the <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>participation.</b> These include total asset requirements, collateral requirements and net debit caps. The central bank serves {{as a source of}} liquidity during a financial crisis. The model is constructed along the lines of Diamond and Dybvig (1983). In period 0, banks optimize their holdings of noninterest-earning central bank reserves to meet their payment obligations and any additional liquidity obligation. Their alternative is to invest in a nonliquid asset that earns a rate of return R. In period 1, a number of banks are unable to make their payments. The number of banks defaulting is random and realized after banks decide their optimal reserve holdings. In period 2, the remaining banks must cover the net payments of defaulting banks minus the defaulting banks' collateral holdings. Each remaining bank has three options to meet its liquidity event: deliver reserves it holds {{at the time of the}} shock, borrow funds in the interbank market from banks in net credit positions, or default since it cannot meet its additional obligations. In period 3, final wealth of each due to bank is calculated. All banks want to maximize final wealth in period 3.; The model provides the following results. The model calculates the threshold point where the payments system collapses. An interbank funds market increases the efficiency of the payments system. Implementation of policy options such as total asset requirements, collateral requirements, and net debit caps decrease {{systemic risk}}. The central bank's role as provider of liquidity to the financial system is investigated in the context of the model. Payment systems; Risk...|$|R

40|$|Parliamentary {{approval}} can be {{of crucial}} importance to ensure the democratic legitimacy of military operations as it can establish public consent to the executive's use of force. But involving parliament in decisions to deploy military forces may have negative repercussions on the efficiency of operations, e. g. by slowing down decision-making. As the military activity of democracies {{has been on the}} rise {{since the end of the}} Cold War, democracies around the world have been increasingly pressed to deal with this trade-off between legitimacy and efficiency in sending troops abroad. This paper surveys the deployment provisions of 49 contemporary democracies to establish whether and how parliaments are actually involved in deployment decisions. It demonstrates that the <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> parliamentary <b>participation</b> mark a continuum that ranges from complete exclusion to a comprehensive veto position of parliament over all potential deployments. In between these two extremes, democracies have found a wide variety of solutions to cope with the legitimacy-efficiency problem. Despite the growing prevalence of military deployments, there is no discernible trend towards parliamentarisation, however. Rather the trend towards internationalisation of security policies contributed to a weakening of parliamentary powers in some countries. © 2010 The Author...|$|R
