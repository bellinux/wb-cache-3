40|$|Systematic {{literature}} {{reviews of}} health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) evidence that are to inform economic models can be challenging due to the volume of hits identified in searches using generic terms for HRQoL. Nevertheless, a robust {{review of the literature}} is required to ensure that the health state utility values (HSUVs) used in the economic model are the most appropriate available. This article provides a synopsis of literature relating to identifying, reviewing and synthesising HSUVs. The process begins with scoping the needs of the economic model, including the definitions of health states and the requirements of any reimbursement agencies. A sequence of searches may be required as the economic model evolves. The terminology used for HRQoL measures may be problematic, and as there is no robust HRQoL filter [equivalent to that applied for randomised control trial (RCTs) ], sifting the results of sensitive searches can be resource intensive. Alternative approaches such as forward and backward citation searches may reduce the resources required, while maintaining the integrity of the search. Any included studies should be assessed in terms of quality using a recommended checklist, and insufficient detail in the primary studies should be noted as a short-coming in this exercise. Subject to homogeneity (similar populations, same measure and preference weights) evidence can be pooled in some way, although methodological research into the appropriateness of alternative techniques for meta-analysis is in its infancy. Reporting standards are key and as a minimum should include details on searches, inclusion/exclusion criteria (together with <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion</b> at each stage), assessment of quality and relevance of included studies, and justification for the choice of final HSUVs. ...|$|E
40|$|In Chapter 1, I {{introduce}} ischaemic stroke, thrombolytic therapy, thrombolysis {{trials and}} then discuss the <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion</b> criteria in stroke thrombolysis guidelines. In Chapter 2, I describe methods for examining outcomes in patients {{that are currently}} recommended for exclusions from receiving alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke. In Chapter 3, I examine Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA) data to test whether current European recommendation suggesting exclusion of elderly patients (older than 80 years) from thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke is justified. Employing non-randomised controlled comparison of outcomes, I show better outcomes amongst all patients (P 30 years. Outcomes assessed by National Institutes of Health Scale (NIHSS) score and dichotomised modified Rankin Scale score are consistently similar. In Chapter 4, I compare thrombolysed patients in Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke International Stroke Thrombolysis Register (SITS-ISTR) with VISTA non-thrombolysed patients ("comparators" or "controls") and test exactly similar question as in Chapter 3. Distribution of scores on modified Rankin scale are better amongst all thrombolysis patients than controls (odds ratio 1. 6, 95 % confidence interval 1. 5 to 1. 7; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel P 80 (OR 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 3 to 1. 6; P< 0. 001; n= 3439). Odds ratios are consistent across all 10 year age ranges above 30, and benefit is significant from age 41 to 90; dichotomised outcomes (score on modified Rankin scale 0 - 1 v 2 - 6; 0 - 2 v 3 - 6; and 6 (death) versus rest) {{are consistent with the}} results of ordinal analysis. These findings are consistent with results from VISTA reported in Chapter 3. Age alone should not be a criterion for excluding patients from receiving thrombolytic therapy. In Chapter 5, I employ VISTA data to examine whether patients having diabetes and previous stroke have improved outcomes from use of alteplase in acute ischaemic stroke. Employing a non-randomised controlled comparison, I show that the functional outcomes are better for thrombolysed patients versus nonthrombolysed comparators amongst non-diabetic (P < 0. 0001; OR 1. 4 [95 % CI 1. 3 - 1. 6]) and diabetic (P = 0. 1; OR 1. 3 [95 % CI 1. 05 - 1. 6]) patients. Similarly, outcomes are better for thrombolysed versus nonthrombolysed patients who have not had a prior stroke (P < 0. 0001; OR 1. 4 [95 % CI 1. 2 - 1. 6]) and those who have (P = 0. 02; OR 1. 3 [95 % CI 1. 04 - 1. 6]). There is no interaction of diabetes and prior stroke with treatment (P = 0. 8). Neurological outcomes (NIHSS) are consistent with functional outcomes (mRS). In Chapter 6, I undertake a non-randomised controlled comparison of SITS-ISTR data with VISTA controls and examine whether patients having diabetes and previous stroke have improved outcomes from use of alteplase in acute ischaemic stroke. I show that adjusted mRS outcomes are better for thrombolysed versus non-thrombolysed comparators amongst patients with diabetes mellitus (OR 1. 45 [95 % CI 1. 30 - 1. 62], N= 5354), previous stroke (OR 1. 55 [95 % CI 1. 40 - 1. 72], N= 4986), or concomitant diabetes mellitus and previous stroke (OR 1. 23 [95 % CI 0. 996 - 1. 52], P= 0. 05, N= 1136), all CMH p< 0. 0001. These are comparable to outcomes between thrombolysed and non-thrombolysed comparators amongst patients suffering neither diabetes mellitus nor previous stroke: OR= 1. 53 (95 %CI 1. 42 - 1. 63), p< 0. 0001, N= 19339. There are no interaction between diabetes mellitus and previous stroke with alteplase treatment (t-PA*DM*PS, p= 0. 5). Present data supports results obtained from the analyses of VISTA data in chapter 5. There is no statistical evidence to recommend exclusion of patients with diabetes and previous stroke from receiving alteplase. In Chapter 7, I examine VISTA data to test whether exclusion of patients having a mild or severe stroke at baseline would be justified. Stratifying baseline stroke severity for quintiles of NIHSS scores, I observe that there are significant associations of use of alteplase with improved outcomes for baseline NIHSS levels from 5 to 24 (p< 0. 05). This association lose significance for baseline NIHSS categories 1 to 4 (P = 0. 8; OR, 1. 1; 95 % CI, 0. 3 - 4. 4; N = 8 / 161) or ≥ 25 (P = 0. 08; OR, 1. 1; 95 % CI, 0. 7 - 1. 9; N = 64 / 179) when sample sizes are small and confidence interval wide. These findings fail to provide robust evidence to support the use of alteplase in the mild or severe stroke patients, though potential for benefit appears likely. In Chapter 8, I present a meta-analysis of trials that investigated mismatch criteria for patients’ selection to examine whether present evidence supports delayed thrombolysis amongst patients selected according to mismatch criteria. I collate outcome data for patients who were enrolled after 3 hours of stroke onset in thrombolysis trials and had mismatch on pre-treatment imaging. I compare favourable outcome, reperfusion and/or recanalisation, mortality, and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage between the thrombolysed and non-thrombolysed groups of patients and the probability of a favourable outcome among patients with successful reperfusion and clinical findings for 3 to 6 versus 6 to 9 hours from post stroke onset. I identify articles describing the DIAS, DIAS II, DEDAS, DEFUSE, and EPITHET trials, giving a total of 502 mismatch patients thrombolysed beyond 3 hours. The combined adjusted odds ratios (a-ORs) for favourable outcomes are greater for patients who had successful reperfusion (a-OR= 5. 2; 95 % CI, 3 to 9; I 2 = 0 %). Favourable clinical outcomes are not significantly improved by thrombolysis (a-OR= 1. 3; 95 % CI, 0. 8 to 2. 0; I 2 = 20. 9 %). Odds for reperfusion/recanalisation are increased amongst patients who received thrombolytic therapy (a-OR= 3. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 6 to 5. 8; I 2 = 25. 7 %). The combined data show a significant increase in mortality after thrombolysis (a-OR= 2. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 2 to 4. 9; I 2 = 0 %), but this is not confirmed when I exclude data from desmoteplase doses that are abandoned in clinical development (a-OR= 1. 6; 95 % CI, 0. 7 to 3. 7; I 2 = 0 %). Symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage is significantly increased after thrombolysis (a-OR= 6. 5; 95 % CI, 1. 2 to 35. 4; I 2 = 0 %) but not significant after exclusion of abandoned doses of desmoteplase (a-OR= 5. 4; 95 % CI, 0. 9 to 31. 8; I 2 = 0 %). Delayed thrombolysis amongst patients selected according to mismatch imaging is associated with increased reperfusion/recanalisation. Recanalisation/reperfusion is associated with improved outcomes. However, delayed thrombolysis in mismatch patients was not confirmed to improve clinical outcome, although a useful clinical benefit remains possible. Thrombolysis carries a significant risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and possibly increased mortality. Criteria to diagnose mismatch are still evolving. Validation of the mismatch selection paradigm is required with a phase III trial. Pending these results, delayed treatment, even according to mismatch selection, cannot be recommended as part of routine care. In Chapter 9, I summarise the findings of my research, discuss its impact on the research community, and discuss weaknesses inherent in registry data and limitation of statistical methods. Then, I elaborate the future directions I may take to further research on the theme of this thesis.  EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Objective. Group {{identity}} {{is a central}} concept in many social science disciplines. We investigate why people identify with groups and show favoritism to in-group members. We anticipate group identifications are substantially influenced by genes and social environments, likely working through stable personality traits. Methods. Using twin study data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS I), we investigate the heritability of in-group identification and favoritism, {{as well as the}} extent to which the genetic bases of these orientations are shared with genetic underpinnings of personality traits, primarily focusing on the “Big Five”: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability/neuroticism. Results. Group identification is largely attributable to genetic factors. However, environments also affect group identification. The heritability of personality traits accounts for a modest portion of the genetic variation of group identification. Conclusion. Our findings have implications for the study of collective action, identity politics, and the growing research program investigating social and political behavior genetics. Social {{identity is}} a well-studied aspect of social and political psychology because of its broad implications for individuals and groups. These identities, often formed around descriptive and demographic characteristics like race, religion, and gender, can powerfully link people to each other. Even episodic identities formed around minimal groups 1 can provide people with a source of self-esteem, promote solutions to collective action problems, and inform norms as well as enforcement mechanisms for them.

40|$|Shortly {{after the}} income tax became a {{permanent}} {{part of the federal}} tax landscape in 1913, Congress added a provision to the Internal Revenue Code allowing taxpayers to exclude from income “any damages” received “on account of personal injury or sickness. ” Since its enactment, § 104 (a) (2) {{has been the subject of}} intense scrutiny and constant litigation. Part II of this article reviews the history of the personal injury exclusion. It finds that, at its inception, the exclusion actually constituted two separate exclusions: a statutory <b>exclusion</b> <b>for</b> physical injuries and a nonstatutory <b>exclusion</b> <b>for</b> nonphysical injuries. It examines the policy <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> both <b>exclusions</b> and determines that each resulted from a questionable use of precedent by early tax policymakers. Eventually, the two exclusions were merged, first by the courts and then by Congress, as a result of the 1989 amendment. This historical review leads to two conclusions. First, if Congress, by amending § 104 (a) (2), is stating that the exclusion never was intended to apply to nonphysical injuries, despite the 1989 amendment, then Congress’s position is correct and both the Service and the courts should reject the extension of § 104 (a) (2) to nonphysical injuries in all preenactment cases. Second, and more importantly, history reveals that the original justification for the physical injury exclusion was seriously flawed and should have been rejected by both Congress and the courts. Part III then examines amended § 104 (a) (2) and questions whether Congress’s decision to draw a line between physical and nonphysical injuries and sickness can be applied sensibly. Congress’s attempt to provide a limited <b>exclusion</b> <b>for</b> the nonphysical injury of emotional distress creates serious interpretive difficulties that courts are likely to wrestle with in the near future. Part IV asks the question Did Congress go far enough? It reviews human capital theory and its recent metamorphosis and suggests that this theory remains a suspect foundation for the personal injury exclusion. Consequently, Part IV concludes that Congress was wrong; the only appropriate congressional action with respect to § 104 (a) (2) was repeal...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{discusses the}} thorny {{issue of the}} rationale of the exclusion from patentability of medical treatment methods and the patentability of medical indications. This quest is the consequence of our earlier findings that medical indication patents present a real life risk for many players in the medical chain, i. e. the generic manufacturer, the clinician and the pharmacist of patent infringement (see to that effect our contribution at [2016] I. P. Q., 151). We {{come to the conclusion}} that the <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> the <b>exclusion</b> from patentability of medical treatment methods is not very clear and can be interpreted very broadly. It has changed over time but seems now to be based on a rather wide socio-ethical rationale, aiming at protecting healthcare, which, even if justified, seems to be so broad that not only medical treatment methods but also the very patentability of pharmaceutical products can be subsumed under it. We also conclude that the <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> allowing medical indication patents is equally not very clear, and their allowability was most definitely not a "love at first sight" affair with the legislature. It is submitted that certain medical indication patents sit very close to the activities of clinicians, which makes the argument that medical indication patents do not directly touch the physician not always correct. It is argued that, looking at the historical rationale of both the exclusion from patent protection of medical treatment methods and the patentability of medical indication inventions, there is some force in arguing that medical indication patents are not desirable. We formulate a number of possible solutions. It is argued that abolishing the exclusion from patentability of medical treatment methods, even though feasible if accompanied by the introduction of a therapeutic freedom exemption, is in view of the historical rationale of the exclusion, at least in EPC territories, not very likely to find support. It is further also argued that abolishing medical indication patents could be such a drastic action that it might come at the detriment of at least some genuine innovation in medicinal research, and would require further reflection...|$|R

In addition to (1) {{the inclusion of}} characteristic Lukan vocabulary (Green 1988, 56-57), one may also observe (2) the Lukan emphasis on the appearance of an angel (e.g., 1:11, 26; 2:13, 15; Acts 5:19; 7:30; 8:26; 10:3; 12:7), (3) Luke’s interest in simile (“his sweat was like drops of blood,” v. 44; cf. e.g., 3:22; 10:18; 11:44; 22:31) and (4) Luke’s fondness for physical manifestations (like sweat) accompanying extramundane events (e.g., 1:20; 3:22; Acts 2:2-3; 9:18).
