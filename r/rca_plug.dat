50|$|The Samsung Galaxy Tab {{also has}} an {{optional}} <b>RCA</b> <b>plug</b> connector through which the screen image is shown on a TV or other display (the Tab's own screen cannot be turned off; it can be dimmed with a backlight dimming app).|$|E
50|$|Composite video {{connections}} use {{a single}} <b>RCA</b> <b>plug</b> on each end. Composite video is standard on all AV receivers {{allowing for the}} switching of video devices such as VHS players, cable boxes, and game consoles. DVD players may be connected via composite video connectors although a higher bandwidth connection is recommended.|$|E
5000|$|The connection's plug {{is called}} an <b>RCA</b> <b>plug</b> or phono plug, for [...] "phonograph." [...] The name [...] "phono plug" [...] is {{sometimes}} confused with a [...] "phone plug" [...] which may {{refer to a}} quarter-inch [...] "phone plug" [...] - Tip/Sleeve (TS) or Tip/Ring/Sleeve (TRS) connector - or to a 4P4C connector used for a telephone (which is often, though incorrectly, called [...] "RJ9", [...] "RJ10", or [...] "RJ22").|$|E

50|$|RCA {{connectors}}, {{also known}} as phono connectors or phono plugs, are used for analog or digital audio or analog video. These were first used inside pre-World-War-II radio-phonographs to connect the turntable pickup to the radio chassis. They were {{not intended to be}} disconnected and reconnected frequently, and their retaining friction was quite sufficient for their original purpose. Furthermore, the design of both cable and chassis connectors was for minimum cost. Initially intended for audio frequency connections only, the <b>RCA</b> <b>plug</b> was also used for analog composite video and non-critical radio-frequency applications.|$|E
5000|$|Some TV/VCR combo decks on {{the market}} had stereo TV {{functionality}} with [...] "twin speakers", whereas the VCR feature was only mono, which is typical of [...] "consumer-grade VCRs" [...] from decades ago. Some of these devices even had front RCA inputs for composite video (yellow), and mono audio (white) in which many of these devices didn't even have a right-channel <b>RCA</b> <b>plug</b> (red) {{even if it was}} just for [...] "merging" [...] stereo into mono for mono soundtracks to be recorded onto videotapes. This is odd since one would think that a [...] "right channel" [...] would be included for A/V in on a TV which had MTS stereo TV sound on its tuner.|$|E
5000|$|Wireless {{speakers}} {{are composed}} of two units: a main speaker unit combining the loudspeaker itself with an RF receiver, and an RF transmitter unit. The transmitter connects to the audio output of any audio devices such as hi-fi equipment, televisions, computers, mp3 players, etc. An <b>RCA</b> <b>plug</b> is normally used to achieve this. The receiver is positioned where the listener wants the sound to be, providing the freedom to move the wireless speakers around without the need of using cables. The receiver/speaker unit generally contains an amplifier to boost the audio signal to the loudspeaker; it is powered either by batteries or by an AC electric outlet. [...] Batteries may last {{for three to four}} hours; some wireless speakers operate on rechargeable batteries.|$|E

50|$|Analog audio {{connections}} usually use <b>RCA</b> <b>plugs</b> in stereo pairs. Inputs and outputs {{are both}} common. Outputs are provided mainly for cassette tape decks.|$|R
5000|$|SL-1200MK3 (released in 1989) has a {{matte black}} finish like the MK2, gold <b>RCA</b> <b>plugs,</b> {{and a small}} gold-foil Technics label on the back. It was destined only for the Japanese market.|$|R
500|$|The first EyeTV {{hardware}} device {{was introduced in}} November 2002. It was a small USB-powered device that contained a cable tuner and hardware encoder in order to convert television video into an MPEG-1 format for watching on a computer. It also had coaxial and <b>RCA</b> <b>plugs</b> to connect it with a VCR or camcorder. A 2002 article in Macworld {{said it was the}} [...] "first step" [...] in bridging computers and television, but at this point still had [...] "some kinks".|$|R
50|$|The main unique {{feature of}} the Dimensia system was the MRT 003, a 32-kilobyte {{built-in}} computer module which allowed the monitor to communicate with all Dimensia components and the remote functions. All components were connected via the control bus found on the I/O panel {{on the back of}} the TV. The control bus was a unique RCA connector which was colored black. All Dimensia branded components had this control jack and they all interconnected by using <b>RCA</b> <b>plugs</b> that could piggy-back, resulting in a daisy chain which simplified wiring. This was known as the SystemLink, a communication system that had 16 kilobytes of computer memory.|$|R
50|$|Other {{applications}} that involve mirrored mono with merged stereo occur when MONO is available as an internal feature of {{a device that}} can toggle between STEREO and MONO, for instance many FM radios are capable of toggling between MONO and STEREO in a way where stereo can both MERGE into mono, and then MIRROR between both stereo speakers. This tactic {{can also be used}} on other devices, of which computer software and some video games will have a feature that will allow STEREO or MONO for the soundtrack, in which sometimes this can facilitate MERGING stereo internally to spare one from using a Y adapter with LEFT and RIGHT <b>RCA</b> <b>plugs</b> when using mono equipment, such as guitar amplifiers.|$|R
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the discontinuation of PSP, the Chinese electronics company Lenkeng released a PSP to HDMI converter called the LKV-8000. The device {{is compatible with the}} PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP GO, but the AV cable packaged with it requires an adapter to plug into the PSP GO's port. Instead of component <b>RCA</b> <b>plugs,</b> the PSP's YPbPr AV signal is carried through a D-sub 9 cable that screws into the converter box, which then converts the signal from analog to digital and upscales it to 720p through HDMI. Lenkeng also released a variant of the LKV-8000 with a button allowing the user to toggle between 720p and 1080p. To overcome the problems of PSP games being displayed in a small window surrounded by a black boarder, the LKV-8000 featured a Zoom button on the connector itself. This allowed players to fill screen natively, without any need to use the television's zoom function. A few other Chinese companies have also released clones of this upscaler under different names, like the Pyle PSPHD42. The LKV-8000 and its variants have become popular among players and reviewers as the only means of playing and recording PSP gameplay in full screen.|$|R
50|$|In home applications, the {{composite}} video signal is typically connected using an <b>RCA</b> connector (phono <b>plug),</b> normally yellow. It is often accompanied with red and white (or black) connectors for right and left audio channels respectively. BNC connectors and higher quality coaxial cable are often used in professional television studios and post-production applications. BNC connectors were also used for composite video connections on early home VCRs, often accompanied by either phono connectors or a 5-pin DIN connector for audio. The BNC connector, in turn post dated the PL-259 connector which featured on first generation VCRs.|$|R
30|$|Generally, {{the routine}} core {{analysis}} (<b>RCA)</b> of core <b>plugs</b> permeability measurements made by petroleum industry considers the confining pressure of around 2.8 Â MPa (API 1998). Although, the several recent publications {{have revealed that}} the permeability value obtained under these conditions can be several orders of magnitude higher than under in situ conditions for tight gas sandstone samples (e.g., Jones and Owens 1980; Brower and Morrow 1985). It is difficult to explain such large permeability reductions {{as a result of}} the stress-induced elastic closure of spherical pores (Ostensen 1983). Integration of microstructural observations with theory suggests a more likely explanation of such large stress sensitivity of permeability is due to the presence of high aspect ratio microfractures formed at grain boundaries (e.g., Ostensen 1983; Brower and Morrow 1985).|$|R
