40|$|The {{analysis}} of motorway <b>renewal</b> <b>costs</b> {{presented in this}} paper was driven by two research questions: First, to analyse the economic process of motorway renewal work and to identify whether there exist economies of scale; and second to identify the influence of traffic volume on <b>renewal</b> <b>costs</b> and to derive an estimate of marginal infrastructure costs as part of optimal road user charges. The analysis is based on cross-sectional data for motorway <b>renewal</b> <b>costs</b> and traffic volume in Germany during the period 1980 - 1999. Two translog models were estimated, each of them including the factor input prices for labour, material and capital, and a set of regional dummy variables as well as dummy variables for the type of material used for renewal. The first model includes in addition to these variables the sqm of renewed road as explanatory variable. The second model was constructed to analyse the relationship between traffic volume and <b>renewal</b> <b>costs</b> and contains the average annual daily traffic volume of trucks and passenger cars as independent variables. Two main results were derived from the models: First, motorway renewal work is characterised by substantial economies of scale. Second, the relationship between <b>renewal</b> <b>costs</b> and traffic volume is expressed by a cost elasticity, i. e., the ratio between marginal and average costs, which ranges from 0. 05 up to 1. 17 with a digressive increase of marginal costs. ...|$|E

Railway track renewals are a substantial part of an infrastructure manager 9 ̆ 2 s budget, but in disaggregated statistical analyses, they cause problems for traditional regression models since there is a piling up of values of the dependent variable at zero. Previous econometric work has sought to circumvent the problem by aggregation in some way.

40|$|The {{aftermarket}} {{business is}} a highly profitable activity for companies, and they can earn considerable profits from selling spare parts. Spare parts demands are more uncertain and intermittent in comparison with finished goods and associated work in progress parts. In the aftermarket, the demand uncertainty of the spare parts for the OEMs {{is complicated by the}} fact that the other competitors, known as market players or will-fitters, supply substitutable parts usually with lower cost of production and deliver them to the market at cheaper prices. This uncertainty makes spare parts management challenging, and this study develops strategic approaches for spare parts price setting and inventory level control to further exploit the benefits of the spare parts business. This dissertation is divided into four main parts. ^ In the first part, a brief review of inventory system policies is provided. The review starts with an introduction to the inventory systems terminology and follows with a categorization of the inventory systems with the aim of developing spare parts inventory models. Moreover, a discussion about the computations related to the (Q,r) policy is provided. An algorithm is proposed to find the optimal re-order point/lot-size and a Monte Carlo simulation is designed to evaluate the mathematical optimization solutions including the new algorithm and the other classical methods. In the second part, a literature review related to spare parts management is presented. The literature review is organized in such a way that in the beginning the inventory control policies are introduced. Then the perspective of uniqueness of spare parts on the inventory management is illustrated. Next, spare parts clustering and demand are studied and forecasting methods are reviewed. The use of Game Theory for inventory systems planning is studied. Also spare parts pricing as a strategic method to increase the profit of the suppliers is evaluated. In the third part, to investigate the profitability of spare parts business, the notion of <b>renewal</b> <b>cost</b> versus the replacement cost is proposed. The replacement cost of a product is defined as the current market price of the product and the <b>renewal</b> <b>cost</b> of a product is the acquisition cost of spares to completely renew the product excluding labor costs. These costs are calculated for some products with specific characteristics, and the ratio between the <b>renewal</b> <b>cost</b> and the replacement cost as a scale to evaluate the sustainability of the spare parts pricing is determined which declares that the spare parts pricing is unfair. In the last part, Game Theory as a tool to find ideal decision-making in spare parts management taking into account the interactions among spare parts manufacturers. According to definite assumptions, spare parts inventory games in the form of normal, cooperative and non-cooperative, non-zero-sum, evolutionary, and competitive fringes are studied. The proposed games study the OEMs 2 ̆ 7 decision-making on spare parts pricing strategies, inventory levels, batch productions and re-manufacturing efforts. ^ The proposed strategic spare parts pricing methods as an alternative for regular pricing can factor in customers 2 ̆ 7 willingness to purchase spare parts, demand uncertainty, market uncertainty, competitiveness of the parts in the market, stability of the cooperation or competition in price setting, marginal costs of designing an agreement for cooperation, and the marginal cost of production and inventory. Furthermore it is possible to add the notion of <b>renewal</b> <b>cost</b> and the replacement cost ratio to the price sustainability description and to include it in the suggested strategic pricing formulations as a factor that affects the demand and supply curves. ...|$|R

A system based on a differentiated approach to maintenance cost and renewal cost depreciation is proposed as a tool for track cost processing. Cost planning and the subsequent levying the costs on railway undertakings are both based on a single concept: the theoretical traffic load.

In case of not correct system behaviour it’s possible a wrong overhead line alignment. This determines an increase of line wear and stress...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis {{concerns}} pricing the use of transport infrastructure. We are empirically investigating the relationship between railway traffic volumes and infrastructure management costs. More specifically, {{we are interested in}} estimating the change in infrastructure management costs from marginal variations in traffic volumes, i. e. to estimate the marginal cost of railway infrastructure wear and tear. Both Europe and Sweden have moved towards a marginal cost based transport pricing policy, thus driving the need for more empirical work on rail infrastructure costs to underpin the level of a wear and tear charge. The thesis consists of five papers. In paper I, the data situation for planning railway maintenance and renewal is surveyed internationally. The survey indicates that most infrastructure managers are still in the data gathering phase, rather than ready to use modern computerised planning tools to make sound decisions in the field of maintenance and renewal. In paper II, we investigate the data situation for infrastructure cost analysis in Sweden. A panel data set that consists of cost, traffic and infrastructure information is created. The data covers 1999 - 2002 and contains almost 190 annual observations. Three main cost categories are identified; infrastructure operation, maintenance and renewal. This data is used for estimations of cost functions in paper II, III and V. Econometric techniques are applied for this purpose, with several different model specifications. In paper II, the method of pooled ordinary least squares (POLS) is applied. In paper III, we turn to unobserved effects models to exploit data heterogeneity. Finally in paper V, a dynamic generalised method of moments estimator is used to explore a potential dynamic cost dependency. The main findings are that the POLS approach, which has been used in similar studies in Europe recently, is rejected in favour of fixed effects estimation for this data. Furthermore, we also reject the idea of regression analysis to capture marginal rail <b>renewal</b> <b>costs.</b> In paper IV, we suggest an analytical expression combined with survival analysis of rail ages to estimate marginal <b>renewal</b> <b>costs.</b> We derive elasticities with respect to output as well as marginal costs for the different cost categories, and find that the current charge for wear and tear in Sweden is well below these new estimates. This opens up for increased, marginal cost based rail infrastructure wear and tear charges, which would reduce the financial burden on Swedish tax-payers. QC 2010062...|$|E

40|$|Prior to the {{economic}} crisis, forecasts indicated a continuous increase of traffic in European cities, highlighting the need of a policy to alleviate the external impacts of transport. The crisis, however, generated pressures on all sectors of activity, with transport being an indicative example. The reduction of income and employment, the increased vehicle maintenance and <b>renewal</b> <b>costs</b> and the transport related taxation seem to affect the transport system and its external impacts. Thus, taking for granted that Europe will eventually achieve “sustainable recovery” from the crisis, the current period presents an opportunity for promoting sustainable mobility policies and interventions in the most affected by the crisis European cities. Towards this goal, {{it is essential to}} capitalise on contemporary techniques for the monitoring of changes in transport external costs. The purpose of the paper is the development of a methodology for the estimation of external costs due to congestion, air pollution, climate change and accidents, based on road traffic data. The methodology is applied along road arteries in Thessaloniki for the period “before and after” the emergence of the crisis. As a result, an overall decrease in external costs is observed, creating an unforeseen “surplus” for the society during the crisis...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{with simple}} {{architecture}} and strong constraints on their growth may offer critical insights into how growth strategies affect the tolerance of plants to herbivory. Although Dioscorea praehensilis, a wild yam of African forests, is perennial, both aerial apparatus and tuber are annually renewed. Each year, the tuber produces a single stem that climbs {{from the ground}} to the forest canopy. This stem bears no leaves and no branches until it reaches optimal light conditions. Once in the canopy, the plant's production fuels the filling of a new tuber before the plant dies back to the ground. We hypothesized that if deprived of ant defense, the leafless growth phase is a vulnerable part of the cycle, during which {{a small amount of}} herbivory entails a high cost in terms of loss of opportunity. We compared the growth of stems bearing ants or not as well as of intact stems and stems subjected to simulated or natural herbivory. Ants reduce herbivory; herbivory delays arrival to the canopy and shortens the season of production. Artificially prolonging the stem growth to the canopy increased plant mortality in the following year and, in surviving plants, reduced the stem diameter and likely the underground reserves produced. Tuber size is a key variable in plant performance as it affects both the size of the aerial apparatus and the duration of its single season of production. Aerial apparatus and tuber are thus locked into a cycle of reciprocal annual <b>renewal.</b> <b>Costs</b> due to loss of opportunity may {{play a major role in}} plant tolerance to herbivory, especially when architectural constraints interact with ecological conditions to shape the plant's growth strategy...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to present a {{structured}} methodology which estimates Railway Infrastructure <b>renewal</b> and maintenance <b>costs</b> {{when there is a}} lack of quantitative cost data at the early stages of the project life cycle. Furthermore, this thesis presents renewal and maintenance infrastructure cost estimating issues and investigates current Railway <b>renewal</b> and maintenance <b>cost</b> estimating practice using an industrial case study approach. A flexible design using a case study strategy is described as the most appropriate approach to the successful completion of this study. Industrial case studies using workshops and interview techniques are the primary sources of data whereas literature is used as the secondary sources of data. Following the identification of Railway <b>renewal</b> and maintenance <b>cost</b> estimating issues, a further review of literature leads to the development of a hypothesis. In order to investigate the hypothesis a structured cost estimating methodology is developed which comprises four main stages: creating a project structure that composes the goal, project criteria and alternatives; collecting the necessary data in the form of pairwise comparisons made by a domain expert; producing alternative weights using a geometric mean; and finally employing an algorithmic method using the produced alternative weights and the known cost of one alternative per criteria. The model was implemented within a prototype software tool. This provided a means to validate the proposed model using three industrial case studies. These results provide evidence that the application of a pairwise comparisons based methodology to Railway <b>renewal</b> and maintenance <b>cost</b> estimating problems can provide beneficial. The results indicated that twelve of the fifteen estimates produced by the model were within the expected accuracy and therefore on most occasions prove the hypothesis to be true.
