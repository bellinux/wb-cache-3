5000|$|The Dublin Regulation (Regulation No. 604/2013; {{sometimes}} the Dublin III Regulation; previously the Dublin II Regulation and Dublin Convention) is a European Union (EU) law that determines the EU Member State responsible to examine {{an application for}} asylum seekers seeking international protection under the Geneva Convention and the EU Qualification Directive, within the European Union. It {{is the cornerstone of}} the Dublin System, which consists of the Dublin Regulation and the EURODAC Regulation, which establishes a Europe-wide fingerprinting database for unauthorised entrants to the EU. The Dublin Regulation aims to [...] "determine rapidly the Member State responsible an asylum claim" [...] and provides for the transfer of an asylum seeker to that Member State. Usually, the <b>responsible</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> will be the state through which the asylum seeker first entered the EU.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{solidarity}} and burden-sharing (responsibility-sharing respectively) in the EU Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Its primary aim is to apply the theory of burden-sharing to the case of the EU asylum policy and in particular, to verify or falsify Olson's free-riding hypothesis on the exploitation of the great by the small (meaning of the rich by the poor). This hypothesis will be tested using a mixed research method which combines qualitative and quantitative elements. The qualitative part will focus on the analysis of the so-called Dublin Regulation (Dublin II and III) and its criteria and mechanisms of determining the <b>responsible</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> for examining an asylum application. Applying Moravcsik's liberal intergovernmentalism, a special emphasis will be placed on the proces of negotiating the Regulation (Dublin II) in an attempt to identify and clarify dominant Member States' positions and their influence on the final wording. Consequently, the level of burden- sharing will be illustrated on the example of interstate transfers of asylum seekers (so-called physical burden-sharing). This type of burden-sharing will be also demonstrated qualitatively by means of statistical data available for the period of 2008 - 2013 which will be interpreted in relation to [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The drafters of the 1990 Dublin Convention knowingly and willfully disregarded divergences among Member States' {{protection}} systems. Like a boomerang, {{the fallacy}} of this approach has now reappeared in cases where asylum seekers have challenged transfers under the Convention, tasking judges to tackle a problem which its drafters avoided. The core issue {{of this article is}} whether and when such divergences force a Member State to abstain from removing an asylum seeker to another Member State, provided that such removal entails a downgrading of protection. Which approaches can be taken by authorities and courts seized with the legality of removal under the Dublin Convention? On one end of the spectrum, the formal approach relies on the fact that all Member States are bound by the 1951 Refugee Convention, the 1967 Protocol and the ECHR, and its proponents affirm the legality of removal regardless of factual differences amongst Member States in offering protection. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, we find an empirical approach. Its proponents ask whether a specific asylum seeker would actually be treated in accordance with international law by the <b>responsible</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> In Adan and Aitseguer, the U. K. Court of Appeal and the U. K. House of Lords have explicitly rejected the formal approach and opted for the empirical approach. So did the ECtHR in T. I. vs. the U. K. In the Minority Bosnians Decision, the Swedish Government has paid lip-service to the formal approach, but de facto applied the empirical approach, which effectively determined its outcome. Our analysis shows that there are good reasons for these preferences: the formal approach is untenable mainly for reasons of its logical and practical inconsistency. As long as Member States interpret their international obligations towards protection seekers differently, the empirical approach must be regarded as inherent in the prohibitions of refoulement contained in international law and thus a mandatory part of Dublin procedures...|$|E
50|$|Various discussions {{have taken}} place in recent years over the {{suitability}} of the Security Council veto power in today's world. Key arguments include that the five permanent members no longer represent the most stable and <b>responsible</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in the United Nations, and that their veto power slows down and even prevents important decisions being made on matters of international peace and security. Due to the global changes that {{have taken place}} politically and economically since the formation of the UN in 1945, widespread debate has been apparent over whether the five permanent members of the UN Security Council remain the best <b>member</b> <b>states</b> to hold veto power. While the permanent members are still typically regarded as great powers, there is debate over their suitability to retain exclusive veto power.|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. My {{study will}} focus in {{particular}} on three claims {{made in the}} literature about <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. The first claim is that <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation was initially low and {{that much of the}} Court's constitutionalization of the Treaty occurred when <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were simply too inattentive to notice the magnitude of the Court's activity. The second claim is that early <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation is changing as <b>member</b> <b>state</b> evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law. The final claim tested is that, with the Single European Act's change to qualified majority voting in the Council, member states' attitudes of acceptance toward the Court will change, and criticism of the Court will increase. This hypothesis is {{based on the belief that}} the supranationalism of the ECJ was accepted because of the intergovernmentalism of the Council. The data on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation suggests, however, that none of these claims provide an accurate picture of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. While there has been an increase in participation over time, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have shown a high degree of participation in Article 177 cases from the outset. Further, trends in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> participation do not provide adequate empirical proof of a change in <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation from self-interest to a Community interest.
