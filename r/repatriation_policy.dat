25|$|As Germany and Austria {{came under}} Allied {{military}} administration, the commanders assumed {{responsibility for the}} safety and disposition of all displaced persons. The Allies provided for the DPs according to nationality, and initially did not recognize Jews as constituting a separate group. One significant consequence of this early perspective was that Jewish DPs sometimes found themselves housed in the same quarters with former Nazi collaborators. Also, the general policy of the Allied occupation forces was to repatriate DPs to {{their country of origin}} as soon as possible, and there was not necessarily sufficient consideration for exceptions; <b>repatriation</b> <b>policy</b> varied from place to place, but Jewish DPs, for whom repatriation was problematic, were apt to find themselves under pressure to return home.|$|E
25|$|General George Patton, the {{commander}} of the United States Third Army and military governor of Bavaria, where most of the Jewish DPs resided, was known for pursuing a harsh, indiscriminate <b>repatriation</b> <b>policy.</b> However, his approach raised objections from the refugees themselves, as well as from American military and civilian parties sympathetic to their plight. In early July 1945, Patton issued a directive that the entire Munich area was to be cleared of displaced persons with an eye toward repatriating them. Joseph Dunner, an American officer who in civilian life was a professor of political science, sent a memorandum to military authorities protesting the order. When 90 trucks of the Third Army arrived at Buchberg to transport the refugees there, they refused to move, citing Dunner's memo. Based on these efforts and blatant antisemitic remarks, Patton was relieved of this command.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} {{we focus on the}} {{acceptance}} of migrants among the general public in the receiving societies. We analyze the most radical of such anti-immigrant sentiments, that is, the support for <b>repatriation</b> <b>policies</b> for legally established immigrants. We analyze intra- and international differences among Western and Eastern European societies, taking advantage of recently collected cross-national high quality data providing means to rigorously test hypotheses on individual and contextual level determinants. Although there are large differences between countries within European regions, we found that support for <b>repatriation</b> <b>policies</b> is overall somewhat higher in Western European societies. In line with Ethnic Group Confl ict Theory, support for <b>repatriation</b> <b>policies</b> is stronger in countries with higher proportions of resident migrants and higher levels of immigration. Regarding individual level determinants, we found that particularly lower educated individuals are more in favor of repatriation of migrants. The effect of education differs however across countries and is – in line with socialization theories – less strong in Eastern European countries. ...|$|R

25|$|The Japanese {{enforced}} a <b>repatriation</b> <b>policy</b> {{throughout the}} period of occupation because of the scarcity of food and the possible counter-attack of the Allies.

In order to expand the Kai Tak Airport, for example, the Japanese demolished the Sung Wong Toi Monument in today’s Kowloon City.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} profit <b>repatriation</b> <b>policies</b> for US multinational firms. Dividend repatriations are surprisingly persistent and resemble dividend payments to external shareholders. Tax considerations influence dividend repatriations, but not decisively, as differentially-taxed entities feature similar policies and some firms incur avoidable tax penalties. Parent companies requiring cash to fund domestic investments, or to pay dividends to common shareholders, draw on the resources of their foreign affiliates through repatriations. Incompletely controlled affiliates {{are more likely than}} others to make regular dividend payments and to trigger avoidable tax costs through repatriations. The results indicate that traditional corporate finance concerns - taxation, costly external finance, and agency problems - are also critical to the internal capital markets of multinational firms...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{relationships}} among two issues important in international {{human resources management}} but rarely investigated for international volunteers in Australian aid/charity/ mission organisations (ACMs) : repatriation assistance offered to international volunteers, {{the extent to which}} international volunteers perceive their employers to be fulfilling their psychological contract (PC) with them and their continued commitment with their ACMs. We find that, unlike for profit (FP) companies, the investigated ACMs do little to assist international volunteers, even long-term ones, with repatriation readjustment. Despite this, volunteers 2 ̆ 7 perceived fulfilment of their PCs is not breached. Volunteers are largely satisfied with the minimal support that they receive and show high commitment to the ACM following the overseas assignment.

For two months, I have conducted ethnographic fieldwork at the family location in Amersfoort, the Netherlands, where migrant families who are denied Dutch citizenship temporarily reside while their repatriation is organized by the Dutch state. Specifically, my fieldwork was oriented on the executing institution of Dutch repatriation policy: the Repatriation and Departure Service (Dienst Terugkeer en Vertrek, DT&V). Using illness as unit of analysis, I display and analyze the various microphysical governing mechanisms employed by state officers and migrants. <b>Repatriation</b> <b>policies</b> implemented by DT&V officers meet opposing practices of migrants and other actors, which results in a space characterized by constant encounter, tension, conflict and contestation.

40|$|Repatriation is an {{increasingly}} significant {{issue in the}} museum world. It {{is concerned with the}} return of cultural artefacts that have been previously traded or sold into foreign countries or institutions, either {{at the behest of the}} indigenous people or the initiative of the institution holding them. This dissertation explores the role of repatriation in modern New Zealand museums and its role in furthering the often contentious relationship between Maori and museum staff. It has a specific focus on the excavation and repatriation of human remains at Wairau Bar in Marlborough. It critiques an unpublished history of the Bar written by independent historian David Armstrong, which was commissioned by Rangitane in 2009. My overall argument disputes Armstrong's portrayal of Roger Duff, ethnologist at the Canterbury Museum, as the leader of a surreptitious excavation who was consistently underhand and secretive in his dealings with Rangitane. I counter Armstrong's claims to demonstrate that Duff valued an open and transparent relationship with Rangitane and respected their cultural attitudes to ancestral remains. I conclude that these remain core values in both modern <b>repatriation</b> <b>policies</b> and museum relations with Maori. My contextual discussion draws largely on secondary scholarship and journal articles while my conclusions about Wairau Bar are largely based on primary archives and Armstrong's report...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the policies and}} procedures created {{during and after the}} First World War that provided the foundation for how the United States commemorated its war dead for the next century. Many of the techniques used in modern times date back to the Great War. However, one hundred years earlier, America possessed very few methods or even ideas about how to locate, identify, repatriate, and honor its military personnel that died during foreign conflicts. These ideas were not conceived in the halls of government buildings. On the contrary, concerned citizens originated many of the concepts later codified by the American government. This paper draws extensively upon archival documents, newspapers, and published primary sources to trace the history of America’s burial and <b>repatriation</b> <b>policies,</b> the Army Graves Registration Services, and how American dead came to permanently rest in military cemeteries on the continent of Europe. The unprecedented dilemma of over 80, 000 American soldiers buried in France and surrounding countries {{at the conclusion of the}} First World War in 1918 propelled the United States to solve many social, political, and military problems that arose over the final disposition of those remains. The solutions to those problems became the foundation for how America would repatriate, honor, and mourn its military dead for the next century. Some of these battles persist even today as the nation tries to grapple with the proper way to commemorate the nation’s participation in the First World War on the eve of the conflict’s centennial...|$|R

40|$|This thesis, {{through a}} {{comparative}} study of Kosovar Albanian refugees in the UK and Italy, develops an understanding of refugees' attitudes towards return and identifies {{the factors that influence}} their decision-making process through the analysis of their interaction with the country of origin and the society of reception. It formulates a theoretical approach to the study of refugee repatriation based on Archer's form of sociological realism and her morphogenetic model, while also drawing on previous studies of refugee flight, settlement and return, which argue for the advantage of studying refugee specific issues as part of the whole chain of events that characterise the experience of exile. As such, it represents a contribution towards the theoretical understanding of refugees in general and refugee repatriation in particular. The case study is grounded on this theoretical approach and analyses refugees' perspectives on return within the proposed frame. It is based upon a qualitative study through fieldwork with refugees in both countries of exile and in this respect marks a distinctive contribution to the study of refugees in the UK and in Italy in general, and to the study of refugees' approach to return in particular. The thesis dismisses the predominant assumption of governments that' all refugees want to return' and concludes that refugees' attitudes towards return depend on a range of factors: their relationship with the country of origin, their interaction with the country of exile and their personal background. More significantly, it demonstrates the linkages between these factors and the time and modality of their flight, their interaction with the reception, integration and <b>repatriation</b> <b>policies</b> of the country of exile and their relationship with the conflict and society in the country of origin. In this respect, it represents a contribution to existing studies of refugee repatriation through the development of a more sophisticated account of what influences the decision-making process of refugees vis-a-vis return.
