40|$|Abstract — Wireless links present higher {{loss rate}} than current wired links {{due to the}} {{inherent}} characteristics of wireless transmission. Lossy environments break the fundamental assumption of current transport protocols that a loss indicates congestion, which results in a reduction in throughput. To avoid changes to the infrastructure, we propose an end-to-end approach to loss discrimination based on network state estimation at the <b>receiver.</b> <b>Discrimination</b> is achieved by correlating the short-term jitter history with anomalous jitter and loss. Through simulation, an experimental rate-based protocol using the discrimination heuristic is compared to a stock TCP and a TCP modified to deal with wireless losses. Our experimental results validate the heuristics and show that better performance can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Design and {{planning}} guidelines being followed to define feeder link parameters for the U. S. ITU Region 2 DBS system are outlined. The carrier/noise (C/N) ratio determines the signal quality {{acceptable to the}} consumer and sets the standards which the link must meet. A 10 dB margin is required to meet a 99 percent availability criterion for the times of heaviest rainfall attenuation. The receiver gain {{is limited by the}} bandwidth, system noise temperature, and the antenna size. Three mechanisms have been identified for ensuring <b>receiver</b> <b>discrimination</b> between desired and interfering signals. Test points must be selected to examine the effectiveness of the chosen feeder link configuration in maintaining signal reception and channel separation, of the antennas installed, and of the orbital positions of the satellites...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of the Internet depends {{on the presence of}} well-behaved flows. While TCP forms the majority of the traffic over the Internet, the Internet user community is also dedicated to supporting mobile devices over wireless networks. However, TCP is not well suited to support applications over lossy wireless networks. Ideally, these applications require a protocol that adapts to network conditions with the ability to discriminate congestion-based and transmission-based losses. In this paper, we present a rate-based transport protocol that is designed to support communication for mobile nodes using infrastructure-based wireless networks. We propose an end-to-end approach to loss discrimination based on network state estimation at the <b>receiver.</b> <b>Discrimination</b> is achieved by correlating short-term history of packet inter-arrival times with the loss. We also integrate a congestion avoidance algorithm to react to pending network congestion. Simulations of our protocol prototype show that rate-based protocols can provide better correlation to network conditions than ACK-clocked protocols. We provide extensive evaluation through simulation demonstrating that our protocol is well-behaved over a wide range of scenarios...|$|E

40|$|We numerically {{study the}} {{performance}} of the displacement based quantum <b>receiver</b> for the <b>discrimination</b> of weak 3 - and 4 -phase-shift keyed (PSK) coherent state signals. We show that due to the nontrivial asymmetry of the receiver structure, optimization of the prior probability increases the mutual information and achieves sub-shot-noise limit discrimination. Moreover, we estimate the cutoff rate for a 4 -PSK signal and confirm that the prior probability optimization shortens the code length for a given decoding error criterion. Such consideration for the asymmetric channel matrix is essential in a study of the compassable quantum receiver...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the impact of}} transmission errors on the backoff algorithm behavior in the IEEE 802. 11 protocol. Specifically, since the backoff algorithm assumes that all packet losses are due to collisions, it unnecessarily backs off when a packet is lost due to a transmission error. Two performance problems arise as a result: (1) low throughput, due to unnecessary loss of transmission time; and (2) unfairness when two competing links have different transmission error rates. In this paper, we characterize this problem and propose three solutions to it. The solutions aim to provide discrimination between transmission errors and collisions such that the sender can back off appropriately. The first algorithm relies on <b>receiver</b> <b>discrimination</b> and feedback; the receiving radio can in many instances differentiate between collisions and transmission errors. The second algorithm estimates the clear channel quality, and backs off if the observed quality deviates from the clear channel quality (indicating collisions). The third algorithm develops the probability of collision {{as a function of}} the number of observed idle slots during contention, and uses this probability to control the backoff algorithm. We show via simulation that the techniques significantly improve both performance and fairness of IEEE 802. 11 in the presence of transmission errors. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{impossibility of}} {{perfectly}} discriminating non orthogonal quantum states imposes far-reaching consequences both on quantum and classical communication schemes. We propose and numerically analyze an optimized quantum <b>receiver</b> for the <b>discrimination</b> of phase encoded signals.

The discrimination is performed via an optimized, feedback-mediated displacement {{prior to a}} photon counting detector.

The results demonstrate the receiver's robustness and show that it can outperform any classical receiver over a wide range of realistic parameters. Comment: 10 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{scheme for}} the {{detection}} of low-intensity optical coherent signals was studied which uses a probabilistic amplifier operated in the non-heralded version, as the underlying non-linear operation to improve the detection efficiency. This approach allows us to improve the statistics by keeping track of all possible outcomes of the amplification stage (including failures). When compared with an optimized Kennedy <b>receiver,</b> the resulting <b>discrimination</b> success probability we obtain presents a gain up to ~ 1. 85 % and it approaches the Helstrom bound appreciably faster than the Dolinar receiver, when employed in an adaptive strategy. We also notice that the advantages obtained can be ultimately associated with the fact that, in the high gain limit, the non-heralded version of the probabilistic amplifier induces a partial dephasing which preserves quantum coherence among low energy eigenvectors while removing it elsewhere. A proposal to realize such transformation based on an optical cavity implementation is presented. Comment: Final version: 6 pages and 4 figure...|$|R

This signal processing method {{can be used to}} identify signal modulation type and extract the parameters of low probability of intercept signals in electronic intelligence <b>discrimination</b> <b>receivers.</b> This implementation builds on previous work at the Naval Postgraduate School and focuses on reducing the overall runtime to approach real-time processing. The focus of the implementation is to utilize dual field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) within a single multi-adaptive processor (MAP).

Hypothesis: TheKerlan-JobeOrthopaedic ClinicOverheadAthlete Shoulder andElbow score (KJOCscore) will correlatewith other validated scores for upper extremity assessment but will be more accurate in evaluating ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction outcomes in professional baseball players. Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Fifty-five professional baseball players who underwent ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction {{were asked to complete}} the KJOC score, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder andHand (DASH) score, and theDASH sportsmodule.

40|$|Study objective: To {{validate}} the APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) III unadjusted and similar hospital mortality estimate models on 30 -day mortality, and {{to propose a}} simple approach to modeling local 30 -day in-hospital mortality of critically ill hospitalized adults for quality management and risk-adjusted monitoring. Design: Noninterventional, observational study. Patients: A total of 5, 278 consecutive eligible hospital admissions between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1999. Measurements: Prospective collection of demographic, diagnostic, physiologic, laboratory, and hospital admission and discharge data. Results: The APACHE III mortality predictions exhibited excellent <b>discrimination</b> (<b>receiver</b> operating characteristic [ROC] curve area) for 30 -day outcome (ROC area, 0. 89) and hospital outcome (ROC area, 0. 89). Calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics demonstrated good calibration of all models on 30 -day outcome, except for the unadjusted APACHE III model. New, simplified risk adjustment models showed good discrimination and calibration on development and test data. ROC areas were 0. 88 (developmental data) and 0. 87 (test data), and the new model calibration was equivalent to the APACHE III model. Conclusion: For quality audit, 30 -day in-hospital mortality {{can be used as}} an alternative outcome to survival to hospital discharge. New logistic regression models provide evidence that local models, possessing good calibration and discrimination, may be built from a few explanatory variables. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A typical ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast) ground {{receiver}} {{is equipped}} with an omnidirectional antenna to receives the messages transmitted by the ADS-B equipped aircraft. The aircraft transmit unsolicited ADS-B messages periodically, on the 1090 MHz downlink channel. There are other ATC systems using the same frequency (Secondary Surveillance Radar SSR, Traffic Information System – Broadcast TIS-B), then, considering that the ADS-B receiving stations use omnidirectional antenna {{or in some cases}} a six sector antenna, the probability of interference grows with the air traffic increase. Therefore there is a risk of data loss due to “garbled” ADS-B OUT 1090 ES messages in the receiving station, with a reduction of the valid data rate. In this paper an ADS-B ground <b>receiver</b> with signals <b>discrimination</b> capability is proposed. Such device is able to detect and solve signals overlapping events. This feature is useful to improve the 1090 extended squitters receiving capacity for a ground receiver station. The proposed receiver is composed by the antenna system, an analog-digital front-end and a pre-processing unit followed by a RTCA-DO 260 compliant 1090 MHz decoder. The pre-processing unit implements the signal discrimination and separation procedures. These procedures are based on processing algorithms studied and developed by Tor Vergata University RadarLab. This unit differs depending if the antenna is single element or an array, for which case the underlying algorithm has better performances.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a prognostic model for incident knee osteoarthritis (KOA) {{in a general}} population and determine the value of different risk factor groups to prediction. METHODS: The prognostic model was developed in 2628 individuals from the Rotterdam Study-I (RS-I). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for questionnaire/easily obtainable variables, imaging variables, genetic and biochemical markers. The extended multivariate model was tested on <b>discrimination</b> (<b>receiver</b> operating characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC)) in two other population-based cohorts: Rotterdam Study-II and Chingford Study. RESULTS: In RS-I, there was moderate predictive value for incident KOA based on the genetic score alone in subjects aged < 65 years (AUC 0. 65), while it was only 0. 55 for subjects aged ≥ 65 years. The AUC for gender, age and body mass index (BMI) in prediction for KOA was 0. 66. Addition of the questionnaire variables, genetic score or biochemical marker urinary C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type II collagen to the model did not change the AUC. However, when adding the knee baseline KL score to the model the AUC increased to 0. 79. Applying external validation, similar results were observed in the Rotterdam Study-II and the Chingford Study. CONCLUSIONS: Easy obtainable 'Questionnaire' variables, genetic markers, OA at other joint sites and biochemical markers add only modestly {{to the prediction of}} KOA incidence using age, gender and BMI in an elderly population. Doubtful minor radiographic degenerative features in the knee, however, are a very strong predictor of future KOA.

40|$|Background: Several simple {{clinical}} grading {{scores have}} been developed for intracerebral hemorrhage, primarily to predict 30 -day mortality. Aims: We aimed to determine the accuracy of three popular scores (original intracerebral hemorrhage, modified intracerebral hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage grading scale) on 30 -day mortality and 90 -day death or major disability, and whether the magnitude of benefit varies according to prognosis graded by the three predictive scores. Methods: Data from the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial which included 2839 intracerebral hemorrhage patients (< 6 hours) and elevated systolic blood pressure (150 - 220 mmHg), randomized to intensive (target systolic blood pressure < 140 mmHg) or guideline-based (< 180 mmHg) blood pressure management. Discrimination of scales for predicting death and poor outcome (modified Rankin scale 3 - 6) was evaluated in area under receiver operator characteristic curves. Results: Among 2556 (90 %) participants with available data, the modified intracerebral hemorrhage had the highest <b>discrimination</b> (<b>receiver</b> operator characteristic 0 · 75) for 90 -day poor outcome compared with the original intracerebral hemorrhage (receiver operator characteristic 0 · 68) and intracerebral hemorrhage grading scale (receiver operator characteristic 0 · 69). All scores had good positive predictive value (approximately 80 - 90 %) for poor outcome but poor sensitivity and positive predictive value for death. The scores do not clearly discriminate a patient group most likely to benefit from blood pressure lowering. Conclusions: Intracerebral hemorrhage prognostic scores are not useful in defining patients at high probability of early death, but they are reliable for predicting poor outcome, defined by death or major disability. Potential benefits of early intensive blood pressure lowering are broadly applicable across grades of severity defined by such scores...|$|R
40|$|Background-—Pneumonia {{frequently}} complicates stroke andhasamajor impact onoutcome. Wederived and internally validated {{a simple}} clinical risk score for predicting stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP), and compared the performance with an existing score (A 2 DS 2). Methods and Results-—We extracted data {{for patients with}} ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme multicenter UK registry. The data were randomly allocated into derivation (n= 11 551) and validation (n= 11 648) samples. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to the derivation data to predict SAP in the first 7 days of admission. The characteristics of the score were evaluated using <b>receiver</b> operating characteristics (<b>discrimination)</b> and by plotting predicted versus observedSAP frequency in deciles of risk (calibration). PrevalenceofSAPwas 6. 7 %overall. Thefinal 22 -point score (ISAN: prestroke Independence [modified Rankin scale], Sex,Age,National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) exhibited good discrimination in the ischemic stroke derivation (C-statistic 0. 79; 95 %CI 0. 77 to 0. 81) and validation (C-statistic 0. 78; 95 %CI 0. 76 to 0. 80) samples. It waswell calibrated in ischemic stroke andwas further classified intomeaningful riskgroups (low 0 to 5,medium 6 to 10, high 11 to 14, andvery high ≥ 15) associated with SAP frequencies of 1. 6 %, 4. 9 %, 12. 6 %, and 26. 4 %, respectively, in the validation sample. Discrimination for both scores was similar, although they performed less well in the intracerebral hemorrhage patients with an apparent ceiling effect. Conclusions-—The ISAN score is a simple tool for predicting SAP in clinical practice. External validation is required in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke cohorts.

40|$|In {{wireless}} transceiver circuits {{some of the}} most prevalent required off-chip components are discrete filters. These components are generally implemented with surface acoustic wave (SAW) or ceramic components. These devices are used in the <b>receiver</b> section for <b>discrimination</b> of incoming radio frequency (RF) signals as well as downconverted intermediate frequency (IF) signals. Presently, with the growing demand for multi-functional wireless consumer devices, the need for full integration of RF and logic circuits in wireless communications systems is becoming increasingly evident. If integrated RF filters with acceptable electrical characteristics could be realized, this might reduce or eliminate the currently required off-chip filters, prospectively decreasing the complexity, size, and cost of future {{wireless transceiver}} circuits and systems. The objective of the present research effort is to implement an integrated Q-enhanced LC bandpass filter in a prospective receiver front-end RF amplifier using the passive and active components available in a standard digital complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. CMOS is the standard design medium for digital circuitry, and with the increased unity gain or transit frequency (fT) values that accompany steadily shrinking CMOS device sizes, the implementation of gigahertz frequency communications circuits in this medium is increasingly feasible. The circuit design specifically investigated in this work introduces a loss-compensated second-order gigahertz range bandpass filter implemented in a 0. 18 쭠digital CMOS process provided by National Semiconductor. This filter incorporates a unique design technique that provides improvements in filter linearity through an independently variable bias level shifting method, while also facilitating prospective single-to-differential signal conversion. One distinctive characteristic of the investigated circuit, in comparison to other RF integrated filter work, is the implementation of a novel integrated transformer feedback method that facilitates magnetically coupled loss-restoration and subsequent filter Q-enhancement. Additionally, this loss restoration method is achieved using a single transistor, in contrast to the multi-transistor cross-coupled transconductor Q-enhancement technique commonly implemented in other previous and current integrated RF filter research.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Intensive {{care unit}} (ICU) {{outcomes}} {{have been the}} subject of controversy. The objective was to model hospital mortality and ICU length-of-stay time-change of patients recorded in the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society adult patient database. DESIGN: Retrospective, cohort study of prospectively collected data on index patient admissions. SETTING: Australian and New Zealand ICUs, 1993 - 2003. PATIENTS: The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society adult patient database, which contains data for 223, 129 patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hospital mortality and ICU length of stay were modeled using logistic and linear regression, respectively, with determination (80 %) and validation (20 %) data sets. Model adequacy was assessed by <b>discrimination</b> (<b>receiver</b> operating characteristic curve area, AZ) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow C) for mortality and R 2 for length of stay. Predictor variables included patient demographics, severity score, surgical and ventilation status, ICU categories, and geographical locality. The data set comprised 223, 129 patients: Their mean (SD) age was 59. 2 (18. 9) yrs, 41. 7 % were female, their mean (SD) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score was 53 (31), they had 16. 1 % overall mortality rate, and 45. 7 % were mechanically ventilated. ICU length of stay was 3. 6 (5. 6) days. A(Z), C statistic, and R 2 for developmental and validation model data sets were 0. 88, 17. 64 (p =. 02), and 0. 18; and 0. 88, 12. 32 (p =. 26), and 0. 18, respectively. Variables with mortality impact (p < or =. 001) were age (odds ratio [OR] 1. 023), gender (OR 1. 16; males vs. females), APACHE III score (OR 1. 06), mechanical ventilation (OR 1. 66), and surgical status (elective, OR 0. 17; emergency, OR 0. 47; compared with nonsurgical). ICU level and locality had significant mortality-time effects. Similar variables were found to predict length of stay. Risk-adjusted mortality declined, during 1993 - 2003, from 0. 19 (95 % confidence interval 0. 17 - 0. 21) to 0. 15 (0. 13 - 0. 16) and similarly for ventilated patients: 0. 26 (0. 24 - 0. 29) to 0. 23 (0. 21 - 0. 25). Predicted mean ICU length of stay (days) demonstrated minimal overall time-change: 3. 4 (2. 2) in 1993 to 3. 5 (2. 7) in 2003, peaking at 3. 7 (2. 4) in 2000. CONCLUSIONS: Overall hospital mortality rate in patients admitted to Australian and New Zealand ICUs decreased 4 % over 11 yrs. A similar trend occurred for mechanically ventilated patients. Length of stay changed minimally over this period.
