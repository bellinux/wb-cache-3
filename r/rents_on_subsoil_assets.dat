40|$|Brunnschweiler and Bulte (2008) [1, 2] provide {{cross-country}} {{evidence that}} resource curse is a "red herring" once one corrects for endogeneity of resource exports and allows resource abundance to affect growth. Their {{results show that}} resource exports are no longer significant while value of <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> has a significant positive effect on growth. But the World Bank measure of <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> is proportional to current rents, and thus is also endogenous. Furthermore, their results suffer from an unfortunate data mishap, omitted variables bias, weakness of instruments, violation of exclusion restrictions and misspecification error. Correcting for these issues and instrumenting resource exports with values of proven reserves {{at the beginning of}} the sample period, there is no evidence for resource curse either and <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> are no longer significant. However, the same evidence suggests that resource exports or rents boost growth in stable countries, but also make especially already volatile countries more volatile and thus indirectly worsen growth prospects. Ignoring the volatility channel may lead one to erroneously conclude that there is no effect of resources on growth...|$|R

40|$|Are natural {{resources}} a 'blessing' or a 'curse' for human development?

These effects are particularly significant in countries with a comparatively lower institutional quality.

40|$|A new and {{extensive}} panel of outward {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) at the sector level is used to estimate the determinants of non-resource and resource FDI. Since FDI is I(1), we estimate panel error-correction models of FDI with spatial lags for FDI and market potential. Our main result is that <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> boost resource FDI, but crowd out non-resource FDI. The effect on non-resource FDI dominates, so that aggregate FDI is less in resource-rich countries. Spatial lags aggravate this crowding out of non-resource FDI. In addition, we find that (i) resource FDI is mainly vertical whereas other FDI is of the export-fragmentation variety; (ii) trade openness, free trade agreements and institutional quality do not impact non-resource FDI but institutional quality does {{have a positive effect on}} resource FDI; and (iii) the short-run dynamics comes mostly from shocks to FDI itself. Our main and ancillary results are robust to different measures of resource reserves and the oil price and to allowing for sample selection bias. co-integration tests; external margin; hydrocarbon reserves; outward sector level FDI; sample selection bias; spatial econometrics; <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|R

40|$|Monetary {{valuation}} {{of oil and}} gas reserves Expressing UK oil and gas reserves in monetary terms allows these <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> to be compared with other economic entities. This provides a means for the commercial depletion of <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> to be set against national income. The results for 1981 to 2000 are presented in Oil and gas monetary balance sheet Since observed market values for transactions in the assets in situ are not widely available, the present value method is used to put a monetary value on the physical stocks of assets. This is an indirect valuation method measuring the current value of the asset's future streams of income by discounting the expected future rent, {{often referred to as the}} economic rent or resource rent. The method relies on information about the size of resource rent, the number of years for which the rent is to be received and the social discount rate to be applied. The resource rent is the net income from extraction defined as total revenue from sales less all costs incurred in the extraction process i. e. operating costs, depreciation of capital and allowances for decommissioning costs and the return on capital. The rate of return on capital is estimated to be 8 % in real terms, in line with Eurostat recommendations 1, but it is worth noting that the resulting valuations ar...|$|R

40|$|The {{papers in}} this special issue present results of the European Union (EU) concerted action ¿Experiences {{with the impact of}} <b>subsoil</b> {{compaction}} <b>on</b> soil crop growth and environment and ways to prevent subsoil compaction¿. The results and conclusions of earlier research <b>on</b> <b>subsoil</b> compaction are memorized and it is emphasized that the conclusions are still sound: high axle load traffic on soils of high moisture content causes deep and persistent subsoil compaction. The concerted action <b>on</b> <b>subsoil</b> compaction in the EU and an almost identical concerted action <b>on</b> <b>subsoil</b> compaction in central and eastern Europe are briefly introduced. This special issue presents a selection of papers of the concluding workshop of the concerted action <b>on</b> <b>subsoil</b> compaction in the EU. It includes three papers on modeling the impact of <b>subsoil</b> compaction <b>on</b> crop growth, water availability to plants and environmental aspects; three papers <b>on</b> modeling of <b>subsoil</b> compaction by heavy machinery; four papers on measurement of soil mechanical and physical properties in relation to subsoil compaction and four papers on methods to determine the risk of subsoil compaction and to identify prevention strategies. The trends in agriculture in relation to subsoil compaction are discussed. A positive trend is that policy makers in the EU and worldwide recognize soil as a vital and largely non-renewable resource increasingly under pressure. A negative trend is that wheel loads in agriculture are still increasing causing severe damage to subsoils. The conclusion is that European subsoils are more threatened than ever in history. Manufactures, agricultural engineers and soil scientists should collaborate and research should be initiated to solve this problem and find solutions. Subsoil compaction should be made recognized by all people involved from farmer to policy maker. Therefore an assessment of the existence and seriousness of subsoil compaction throughout Europe should be initiated...|$|R

We treated soil columns with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and lime (CaCO 3) to study the effects <b>on</b> <b>subsoil</b> ionic reactions. As water percolated through soils that had received surface applications of both EDTA and lime, significant levels of exchangeable aluminum were removed {{to a depth of}} 60 cm, whereas topsoil treatments of lime alone had little effect <b>on</b> <b>subsoil</b> exchangeable Al below 30 cm. Movement of Ca, Mg, and Fe are also presented as functions of EDTA and lime treatments.

40|$|Abstract OnlyThe World Bank has {{constructed}} wealth {{accounts for}} nearly 15 years, {{most recently in}} The Changing Wealth of Nations. The accounts include produced capital, natural capital and human and social capital. Natural capital includes agricultural land, forests, <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> and protected areas, but omit a number of critical natural capital stocks, {{one of which is}} fisheries. This omission reflects the lack of readily available data for fisheries accounts at the country level for most, if not all countries in the world. In general, fisheries and aquatic resources are poorly represented in most national environmental accounting efforts. In a recent review of natural capital accounting in The Changing Wealth of Nations, only a few countries, i. e., New Zealand, Iceland and Norway, construct monetary asset accounts for fisheries on a regular basis. We attempt to fill this gap in this contribution...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{functions}} of reinforcement {{on the behavior}} of reinforced embankment over soft subsoil are discussed first. The mobilized tensile force in the reinforcement contributes to the stability of the embankment, and the confining effect of the reinforcement to embankment fill material and soft subsoil can increase the bearing capacity and reduce the lateral deformation of soft subsoil. However, the effect of the reinforcement <b>on</b> soft <b>subsoil</b> deformation can only become significant when soft subsoil approaches to failure. Then some techniques for modeling the reinforced embankment <b>on</b> soft <b>subsoil</b> are presented, namely, modeling the soil/reinforcement interaction behavior, embankment construction process and hydraulic conductivity variation during consolidation process of soft subsoil. It is demonstrated that these factors are important on simulating the behavior of the reinforced embankment <b>on</b> soft <b>subsoil.</b> Finally, two case histories of the reinforced embankment <b>on</b> soft <b>subsoil</b> are presented. One of the embankments is a geogrid reinforced embankment on Muar clay deposit in Malaysian and another one is a built-to-failure geotextile reinforced embankment in Lian-Yun-Gang, China...|$|R
