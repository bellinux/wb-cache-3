5|$|Another {{formation}} with tyrannosaur <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the Lance Formation of Wyoming. This {{has been}} interpreted as a bayou environment similar to today's Gulf Coast. The fauna was very similar to Hell Creek, but with Struthiomimus replacing its relative Ornithomimus. The small ceratopsian Leptoceratops also lived in the area.|$|E
5|$|Forensic archaeologists are {{involved}} within three main areas. Assisting with crime scene research, investigation, and recovery of evidence and/or skeletal <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> only one aspect.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, Hansen {{was also}} charged with {{rebuilding}} Christiansborg Palace which had burnt down in 1794. Unfortunately, it burnt down {{once again in}} 1884. All that <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the magnificent chapel which, with its Ionic columns, conveys a sense of antiquity.|$|E
2500|$|Five sets of <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> found {{but could}} not be identified. [...] Military {{officials}} say that, by a process of elimination, they believed these <b>remains</b> to <b>be</b> those of the hijackers. Army Military District of Washington officials said the <b>remains</b> which <b>were</b> inextricably commingled {{were excluded from the}} burial so that there was no possibility that any terrorist <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> included. These terrorist and commingled <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in February 2002. The FBI said the <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> [...] "disposed of in a dignified manner'", although a very small amount of suspected terrorist <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> retained to aid in later criminal prosecutions.|$|R
50|$|The priest's <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> exhumed in 1545 {{and were}} {{deemed to be}} incorrupt and moved once again in 1653 after the convent he was interred in was {{suppressed}} - the <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> instead taken to the Santa Maria in Recluso church. His <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> relocated on 3 October 1677. The <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> relocated once more on 4 April 2005 to the Chiesa della Santissima Trinità.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, {{the site}} was {{evaluated}} and dispersed <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> recovered. The stratum which contains pliosaur <b>remains</b> <b>was</b> identified.|$|R
5|$|The film {{contains}} no dialogue {{for the first}} and last 20 minutes or so. By the time shooting began, Kubrick had removed much of the dialogue and narration; what <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> notable for its banality (making the computer Hal seem to have more emotion than the humans) juxtaposed with epic space scenes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{investigation}} of Preclassic <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> difficult at Motul de San José {{due to the}} overlying Late Classic construction, {{it is evident that}} the site experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BCAD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, most of the major structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in the Late Preclassic and became larger and more important than Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s, {{the number}} of {{municipalities}} in Bergen County had reached 70, where it still stands. After the 1920s, the legislature did not create many new municipalities, but local officials used zoning to affect land use, making annexation less attractive. Because of boroughitis, the township {{as a form of}} government all but disappeared from Bergen County. One that <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> South Hackensack, the remnants of Lodi Township that no seceding borough wanted. Its three pieces are separated from each other by several miles.|$|E
50|$|Benefatti died on 19 November 1332. His <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> {{found to}} be incorrupt in 1480 after the Dominican church he was interred in was {{undergoing}} reconstruction and his <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> {{found to be}} still incorrupt in 1604. His <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> moved to the diocese's main cathedral in 1823.|$|R
50|$|Ohlone <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> {{discovered}} in 1973 near Highway 87 during housing development. Some <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> removed during {{the construction of}} the highway.|$|R
50|$|Her <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> {{transferred}} to San Crisogono on 18 August 1865 {{after it was}} discovered that she wanted to be buried there. In 1868 her <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> found intact though her clothes had decayed for the most part so was replaced. In 1920 her <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> found no longer incorrupt.|$|R
5|$|During Cook's second voyage, Forster brought two Tahitian Dogs {{aboard the}} ship to take home to England. They were tested with arrow poison at Malakula by having their legs opened with a lancet and {{inserted}} with the substance; both dogs recovered, though one later died from eating poisonous fish. However, {{the fate of the}} other dog and their <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> unknown.|$|E
5|$|George E. Pickett died in Norfolk, Virginia, on July 30, 1875. The {{cause of}} death was a liver abscess, {{although}} whether it was amoebic or bacterial is not clear. He was initially interred in Cedar Grove Cemetery in Norfolk. His remains were disinterred on October 23 and he was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia on October 24, 1875. More than 40,000 people lined the funeral route while another 5,000 marched in the funeral procession. A memorial to Pickett was erected over his grave site and dedicated on October 5, 1888. The memorial was not, however, placed directly above Pickett's burial site, and the exact location of his <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> not clear.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} tools {{forensic}} anthropologists use {{in the identification of}} <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> their knowledge of osteology and the various differences that occur within the human skeleton. During the course of an investigation, anthropologists are often tasked with helping to determinate an individual's sex, stature, age, and ancestry. To do this, anthropologists must be aware of how the human skeleton can differ between individuals.|$|E
50|$|Star Pointer's <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> {{buried beneath}} {{the finish line}} of the Dean Racetrack in Palatine, IL but his <b>remains</b> <b>are</b> now lost to history.|$|R
50|$|Her <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> interred {{with her}} parents and {{siblings}} in Marseille but were later transferred to Berchem in 1899 and then exhumed for canonical inspection (as part of the beatification proceedings) on 4 March 1989 when her <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> found both intact and flexible. Her <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> later moved to Rome on 28 September 2013.|$|R
50|$|Miyatake's cremated <b>remains</b> <b>are</b> {{buried at}} Evergreen Cemetery in Boyle Heights; {{a portion of}} his <b>remains</b> <b>are</b> stored in the Koyasan Buddhist Temple in Little Tokyo.|$|R
5|$|Styracosaurus {{and other}} horned dinosaurs are often {{depicted}} {{in popular culture}} as herd animals. A bonebed composed of Styracosaurus <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> known from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, about halfway up the formation. This bonebed is associated with different types of river deposits. The mass deaths {{may have been a}} result of otherwise non-herding animals congregating around a waterhole in a period of drought, with evidence suggesting the environment may have been seasonal and semiarid.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{bricks and}} {{brickwork}} were also imported and utilized in other colonies throughout the Dutch Empire in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Fort Zeelandia {{was built on}} a small island off Tainan in Formosa (Taiwan) between 1624 and 1634 after the Dutch acquired Formosa from China as a trading colony. It was built using bricks from Batavia (Jakarta), where the Dutch East India Company had its headquarters. After a siege in 1662, the Dutch surrendered the fort to Koxinga, a Ming dynasty general. The fort was destroyed by an explosion in 1873 when a shell from a British warship blew up the ammunition storehouse. The masonry was later used for other purposes. All that <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> part of the southern wall.|$|E
5|$|Following the eviction, Killakee House {{was briefly}} {{used as an}} {{operations}} base by the Detective Unit of the Garda Síochána in 1931 while they hunted IRA subversives who were hiding explosives at Killakee. When the bank {{was unable to find}} a buyer for the estate, it was acquired by a builder who stripped the house and then demolished it in 1941. The lands were eventually acquired by the State and opened to the public. In the late 1930s, the Director of Forestry, a German called Otto Reinhard, laid out the area as an urban forest. The trees have reclaimed most of the land once occupied by the formal gardens: all that <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the brickwork {{at the rear of the}} Turner glasshouses and the system of irrigation canals and ponds for the exotic plants contained within.|$|E
50|$|In June 1977, Todd's <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> desecrated by graverobbers. The thieves {{broke into}} his casket looking for a $100,000 diamond ring, which, {{according}} to rumor, Taylor had placed on her husband's finger prior to his burial. The bag containing Todd's <b>remains</b> <b>was</b> found under a tree near his burial plot. The bag and casket had been sealed in Albuquerque after Todd's <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> identified following the 1958 crash. Todd's <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> once more identified through dental records and were reburied in a secret location.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{distinct}} titanosaurids denoted as forms A, B, and C {{have been}} found in Area 4. Titanosaurine <b>remains</b> <b>are</b> known from Areas 1 and 2.

5|$|Situated on {{the border}} with Manchester, Stretford became a fashionable place to live in the mid-19th century. Large {{recreation}} areas were established, such as the Royal Botanical Gardens, opened in 1831. The gardens were sited in Old Trafford on the advice of scientist John Dalton, because the prevailing southwesterly wind kept the area clear of the city's airborne pollution. In 1857, the gardens hosted the Art Treasures Exhibition, the largest art exhibition ever held in the United Kingdom. A purpose-built iron and glass building was constructed at a cost of £38,000 to house the 16,000exhibits. The gardens were also chosen as a site for the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887, celebrating Queen Victoria's 50-year reign. The exhibition ran for more than sixmonths and was attended by more than 4.75million visitors. The gardens were converted into an entertainment resort in 1907, and hosted the first speedway meeting in Greater Manchester on 16 June 1928. There was also greyhound racing from 1930, and an athletics track. The complex was demolished in the late 1980s, and all that <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the entrance gates, close to what is now the White City Retail Park. The gates were designated a Grade II listed structure in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The kōata, {{the growing}} {{tip of the}} plant, was eaten raw as medicine. When cooked, {{it was called the}} kōuka. If the spike of unopened leaves and a few outer leaves is gripped firmly at the base and bent, it will snap off. The leaves can be removed, and what <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> like a small {{artichoke}} heart that can be steamed, roasted or boiled to make kōuka, a bitter vegetable available at any time of the year. Kōuka is delicious as a relish with fatty foods like eel, muttonbirds, or pigeons, or in modern times, pork, mutton and beef. Different trees were selected for their degree of bitterness, which should be strong for medicinal use, but less so when used as a vegetable.|$|E
5|$|Diarist John Evelyn {{lived in}} Deptford at Sayes Court from 1652. Evelyn {{inherited}} {{the house when}} he married the daughter of Sir Richard Browne in 1652. On his return to England at the Restoration, Evelyn laid out meticulously planned gardens in the French style, of hedges and parterres. In its grounds was a cottage at one time rented by master woodcarver Grinling Gibbons. After Evelyn had moved to Surrey in 1694, Russian Tsar Peter the Great studied shipbuilding for three months in 1698. He {{and some of his}} fellow Russians stayed at Sayes Court, the manor house of Deptford. Evelyn was angered at the antics of the Tsar, who got drunk with his friends and, using a wheelbarrow with Peter in it, rammed their way through a fine holly hedge. Sayes Court was demolished in 1728-9 and a workhouse built on its site. Part of the estates around Sayes Court were purchased in 1742 for the building of the Navy Victualling Yard, which was renamed the Royal Victoria Victualing Yard in 1858 after a visit by Queen Victoria. This massive facility included warehouses, a bakery, a cattleyard/abattoir and sugar stores, and closed in 1961. All that <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the name of Sayes Court Park, accessed from Sayes Court Street off Evelyn Street, not far from Deptford High Street. The Pepys Estate, opened on 13 July 1966, is on the former grounds of the Victualing Yard.|$|E
25|$|Thirty {{additional}} partial <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> found {{aboard the}} wreck on May 3. Consisting mostly of skulls (often partially crushed) and rib bones, the <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> {{placed in a}} single coffin.|$|R
50|$|Justice Baldwin's <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> {{initially}} interred at Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.). His <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> later disinterred {{and moved}} to Greendale Cemetery, Meadville, Pennsylvania. He is the namesake of Baldwin, Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|Christopher Columbus' <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> first interred at Valladolid, {{then at the}} Monastery of the Cartuja by {{the will}} of his son Diego. In 1542 the <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> {{transferred}} to Colonial Santo Domingo.|$|R

25|$|An {{unavoidable}} {{consequence of}} cremation {{is that a}} tiny residue of bodily <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> left in the chamber after cremation and mixes with subsequent cremations.|$|E
50|$|In the Spring of 2007, six {{skeletal}} <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> {{found during}} the archaeological monitoring of improvement works {{to a local}} water network near Barnhill, Newmarket-on-Fergus. Dating showed that the <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> Pre-Christian.|$|R
50|$|Nicola died on 1 October 1449 and his <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> interred in {{the church}} that he himself established. His <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> laid out for just under {{a week for the}} {{faithful}} and he was then buried under the floor of the church. His friend Pope Nicholas V dictated the sepulchral inscription. His <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> then moved to the main altar in 1712 where it now rests.|$|R
50|$|Bicchieri died in 1314 and her <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> {{placed in}} a modest grave before being {{relocated}} to her convent in 1537. Her <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> moved one final time to the Vercelli Cathedral in 1811.|$|R
