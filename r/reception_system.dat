25|$|The {{television}} programmes {{prepared by}} the Indian government at the four studios were transmitted at 6GHz to ATS 6 from one of two ground stations located in Delhi and Ahmedabad. These signals were then re-transmitted at 860MHz by the satellite, which were directly received in 2000 villages by community television receivers with 3m parabolic antennas. Regular television stations also received the signals and broadcast them to another 3000 villages in the standard VHF television band. Each television signal had two audio channels to carry audio in two major languages of each cluster. This setup was called the Direct <b>Reception</b> <b>System</b> (DRS). Apart from the direct broadcasts, the earth station at Ahmedabad was micro-wave linked to the TV transmitter built {{in the village of}} Pij. The Delhi studio was linked to the terrestrial TV transmitters of AIR. A receive-only station was built in Amritsar and linked to the local TV transmitter.|$|E

50|$|The {{complete}} {{spectrum of}} Ku-band satellite reception stretches from 10.70 GHz-12.75 GHz across two signal polarisations, or a bandwidth of about 4000 MHz. This cannot {{be carried on}} a single coaxial cable and so in a conventional satellite <b>reception</b> <b>system,</b> just one of four sub-bands (received in vertical and horizontal polarization, and high and low frequency,) is sent from the antenna to the indoor receiver as 0.95 GHz-2.15 GHz IF. Which sub-band is required is signalled from the receiver to the antenna’s LNB by a 13/18V and 0/22 kHz tone on the LNB supply sent up the same coaxial cable. In a single antenna distribution system, special quattro LNB supplies all four sub-bands at once, from four outputs and these are supplied as required {{to each of the}} multiple outlets connected to an IF multiswitch.|$|E

Recently the number of users of the telecommunication system has been increased especially in the cellular mobile communication system. Also, the services needed by the subscribers have been increased. This necessitates increasing the bandwidth of the system to transmit the largest amount of information. Wide-Bandwidth increases the noise which reduces the amount of transmitted information. As a result, new technologies required to solve this problem are innovated. This new technology is Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). CDMA technique is designed to solve the increasing demand of the telecommunication services which is considered the best techniques in wireless communication. CDMA system is interference limited; therefore interference reduction must be performed to obtain an acceptable quality of service and capacity. The entire interference is occurred at the wireless channel, so the analysis and maintenance must be focused on it.

5000|$|The {{sinking of}} [...] in 1912 spurred the Canadian {{inventor}} Reginald Fessenden (1866-1932) {{to begin work}} on a long-distance underwater sound transmission and <b>reception</b> <b>system</b> that could detect hazards {{in the path of}} a ship. This led to the invention of the Fessenden oscillator, an electro-acoustic transducer which by 1914 had a proven ability to transmit and receive sound at a distance of 31 miles across Massachusetts Bay and to detect an iceberg ahead of a ship at a range of two miles by bouncing sound off it and detecting the echo, as well as an occasional ability to detect the reflection of sound off the ocean bottom. Further impetus to developing practical applications of underwater acoustics came from World War I, which prompted the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and United States Army Coast Artillery Corps to experiment with sound as a means of detecting submerged submarines. In postwar experiments, the Coast Artillery Corps's Subaqueous Sound Ranging Section conducted experiments in shallow water in Vineyard Sound off Massachusetts in which it detonated explosive charges underwater at the ends of established baselines and measured the amount of time it took for the sound to arrive at hydrophones at the other ends of the baselines in order to establish very accurate measurements of the speed of sound through water. And in 1923, the Submarine Signal Company improved upon its underwater signaling devices by equipping them with radio transmitters that sent signals both to identify the particular device and to indicate to approaching ships that it would generate an acoustic signal at a specific time interval after it sent the radio signal, allowing ships to identify the specific navigational aid they were approaching and {{to take advantage of a}} one-way ranging capability that let their crews determine their direction and distance from the navigational aid.|$|E
