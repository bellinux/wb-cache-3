50|$|The Hague Service Convention {{established}} a more simplified means for parties to effect service in other contracting states. Under the convention, each contracting state {{is required to}} designate a <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> to accept incoming requests for service. A judicial officer who is competent to serve process {{in the state of}} origin is permitted to send request for service directly to the <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> of the state where service is to be made. Upon receiving the <b>request,</b> the <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> in the receiving state arranges for service in a manner permitted within the receiving state, typically through a local court. Once service is effected, the <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> sends a certificate of service to the judicial officer who made the request. Parties are required to use three standardized forms: a request for service, a summary of the proceedings (similar to a summons), and a certificate of service.|$|R

However, the Mexican government dedicates limited resources to the Mexican <b>Central</b> <b>Authority,</b> including insufficient staff to handle the volume of cases. The Mexican <b>Central</b> <b>Authority’s</b> ability to help bring about successful resolution of individual cases involving children taken from the U.S. is correspondingly limited. U.S. Embassy officials meet monthly with Mexican <b>Central</b> <b>Authority</b> personnel to obtain updates on pending cases but, even with regular and continued embassy involvement, the Mexican <b>Central</b> <b>Authority</b> clearly is overburdened. Improvement in this area seems unlikely unless the Mexican government commits more resources to the <b>Central</b> <b>Authority.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} a model of Chinese {{administrative}} units established for foreign rulers or chiefs that were either militarily subdued or self-subdued and naturalized. They received their duty from <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> while keeping their original status, and passed on their duty to heirs. They were to provide annual tribute, following the foreign policy and superintend by the <b>central</b> <b>authority.</b> In terms of foreign policy, they would collaborate with the officials sent by the <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> in administration, participate in military affairs of <b>central</b> <b>authority's</b> interest, and obey the assignation made by the <b>central</b> <b>authority.</b> The system was first introduced by commander Li Daliang between August 23 and September 25, 630.|$|R
2500|$|Inspired by the Hague Evidence Convention and the Hague Service Convention's of 1965 and 1970, the Abduction Convention {{required}} {{the establishment of}} a single <b>Central</b> <b>Authority</b> in each country that would handle two-way communications with domestic courts, administrative agencies and foreign <b>Central</b> <b>Authorities.</b> Furthermore, each <b>Central</b> <b>Authority</b> was required to take [...] "any and all actions" [...] to secure the goals of the treaty and cooperate with other <b>Central</b> <b>Authority's</b> to do the same.

5000|$|Prior to the Hague Evidence Convention and the Hague Service Convention's of 1965 and 1970, most {{treaties}} would designate {{two separate}} agencies to, respectively, transmit and receive treaty petitions and applications with their corresponding agencies in foreign states. The Conventions of '65 and '70 consolidated these roles {{into a single}} <b>Central</b> <b>Authority.</b> Future Conventions, such as Hague Abduction Convention also demanded that the <b>Central</b> <b>Authority</b> in each country handle two-way communications with domestic courts, administrative agencies and foreign <b>Central</b> <b>Authorities.</b> Not only did the Abduction Convention establish <b>Central</b> <b>Authorities</b> that facilitated two way communications, but it also gave a whole laundry list of additional obligations to these new authorities with language requiring <b>Central</b> <b>Authorities</b> to take [...] "any and all actions" [...] to secure {{the goals of the}} treaty and cooperate with other <b>Central</b> <b>Authority's</b> to do the same.

40|$|Strong <b>central</b> <b>authorities</b> {{are able}} to {{effectively}} manage costly defection, but are unable to adequately address lesser conflicts because of limits {{to their ability to}} monitor and enforce. We argue, counterintuitively, that these limitations build coop-eration and trust among subordinates: the limitations contribute to the production of order. First, limits to authority leave space for locally informed decentralized enforce-ment. Second, <b>central</b> <b>authorities</b> act as powerful but incompetent third parties whose threatened interventions increase incentives to cooperate and, therefore, to trust. We outline the mechanisms by which a strong <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> enforces order and test their utility by considering the secondary literature on rates of conflict in strong, weak, and capricious states. We supplement this evidence, based on association, with a close examination of diverse case studies: baseball umpires, commercial contracts, and domestic disputes. By analyzing these case studies, we isolate and describe the mechanisms by which <b>central</b> <b>authorities</b> produce order in varied settings. We find that <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> may be effective, but the majority of this effectiveness derives from an indirect influence on dyadic relations rather than direct intervention. Th...|$|R
