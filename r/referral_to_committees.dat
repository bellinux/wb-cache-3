50|$|Scott {{authored}} new House {{rules to}} require that new bills be printed and distributed to House members before <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> <b>committees</b> and to mandate the fiscal impact of such proposed legislation could consideration by the House. Scott authored legislation that was eventually enacted to require a priority system for funding capital outlay projects, a system that included the requirement that all such projects undergo needs assessment evaluations. This law challenged the governor's traditional control over the capital outlay budget, a system by which the governor could bargain for legislative votes by rewarding cooperative lawmakers with projects in their districts. The battle for reform included a 1978 victory by Scott and his colleagues when they succeeded in the House in defeating Edwards's capital outlay bill, the only time a Louisiana governor had faced such a challenge to his authority.|$|E

5000|$|The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 [...] (also {{called the}} Balanced Budget Refinement Act or BBRA) {{is a federal}} law of the United States, enacted in 1999. [...] The BBRA was first {{introduced}} into the House as H.R. 3075 on October 14, 1999 by Rep. William M. Thomas (R-CA) with 75 cosponsors. It was read twice and then referred <b>to</b> the Senate <b>Committee</b> on Finance. The bill was then slightly altered and reintroduced by Thomas as H.R. 3426 on November 17, 1999. After <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> the House <b>committees</b> on Ways and Means and Commerce, it was incorporated by cross-reference in the conference report into H.R. 3194 on November 18, 1999. The H.R. 3194 bill had been introduced by Rep. Ernest J. Istook, Jr. (R-OK) on November 2, 1999, and was enacted with official title: Making consolidated appropriations {{for the fiscal year}} ending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes.

5000|$|On January 2, 2017, one {{day before}} the 115th United States Congress was {{scheduled}} to convene for its first session, House Republicans held a [...] "surprise vote" [...] to effectively place the OCE under direct control of the House Ethics Committee, therefore making any future review of potential violations of criminal law by members of Congress subject <b>to</b> approval following <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> the Ethics <b>Committee</b> or an appropriate federal law enforcement agency. These new rules also bar the OCE from independently releasing statements publicly on pending or completed investigations. This move was immediately met with criticism by Democratic leaders in both the House and the Senate, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, claiming that [...] "ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress", and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying that the GOP had failed to keep their promise to [...] "drain the swamp", referring to the frequent use of the phrase by President-elect Donald Trump and other Republican leaders during the 2015 campaign.|$|R
5|$|These {{reforms were}} also {{significant}} {{in that they}} gave <b>to</b> Senate <b>committees</b> the role of examining the budget (what {{is referred to as}} the estimates process or estimates hearings), which had hitherto been confined to the Senate and its committee of the whole. The role of the committees was enhanced by three subsequent developments. First, in 1982 the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was established, which, in examining all bills, played a role that complemented that of the examination of all delegated legislation by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic <b>referral</b> of bills <b>to</b> <b>committees,</b> increasing the level of legislative scrutiny taking place within parliament. Third, in 1993, the committees adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial budget estimates hearings. These second hearings are referred to as supplementary budget estimates. Though the committee system was restructured in 1994, 2006 and again in 2009, the range of functions has remained essentially the same.|$|R
5000|$|On January 2, 2017, one {{day before}} the 115th United States Congress was {{scheduled}} to convene for its first session, the House Republican majority voted 119-74 to effectively place the OCE under direct control of the House Ethics Committee, making any subsequent reviews of possible violations of criminal law by Congressional members dependent upon approval following <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> the Ethics <b>Committee</b> itself, or <b>to</b> federal law enforcement agencies. The new rules would have prevented the OCE from independently releasing public statements on pending or completed investigations. Ethics Committee chair Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) defended the action on the rules amendment saying it [...] "builds upon and strengthens the existing Office of Congressional Ethics by maintaining its primary area of focus of accepting and reviewing complaints from the public and referring them, if appropriate, <b>to</b> the <b>Committee</b> on Ethics." [...] House Republicans reversed their plan to gut the OCE less than 24 hours after the initial vote, under bipartisan pressure from Representatives, their constituents and the President-elect, Donald Trump. In addition to negative Trump tweets, criticism was widespread including from Judicial Watch, the Project on Government Oversight, former Representative Bob Ney (R-OH), {{who was convicted of}} receiving bribes, and Abramoff, the lobbyist who provided such bribes.|$|R
50|$|Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 & 2005 if the CAB can {{satisfy the}} High Court {{on the balance}} of probabilities that speciﬁed {{property}} is the proceeds of crime, the court will make an interim order over the property preventing anybody from dealing with it. This order stays in place for 21 days, following which an application is made for an interlocutory hearing, on notice to any person who {{has an interest in}} that property. If it appears to the court that such property is the proceeds of crime, despite anything said by any respondent, an interlocutory order is put in place for a period of seven years. In the course of that time any person who can satisfy the court that the property is not the proceeds of crime can move to have the order lifted. If no such order has been granted during those seven years, the CAB can seek a disposal order effectively extinguishing anybody’s rights to the properties and transferring it to the central exchequer. In April 2014, Deputy Eamonn Maloney sponsored a private members Bill to amend the Proceeds of Crime Acts. Section 1 of the Bill seeks to reduce the seven-year period to two years. This Bill was listed before the Dáil on Friday 8 May 2015 and is viewed as a move by the Government to toughen the laws on confiscating criminals' assets and similarly is expected to yield a multi-million euro windfall for the taxpayer. As the Bill is a Private Members' Bill, its <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> Select <b>Committee</b> on Justice, Defence and Equality was required pursuant to the Standing Orders 82A and 118.|$|R

40|$|As nations {{expand the}} {{telecommunications}} interception and access powers of their {{law enforcement agencies}} to address heightened threats to national security and accelerating technological convergence, the proper application of the proportionality principle is becoming an increasingly contentious issue. The 'proportionality principle' in telecommunications law mandates the weighing of a likely threat to public security against the potential violation of individual rights so as {{to ensure that the}} intrusive impact of a particular interception and access activity is reasonable proportionate to the potential outcome sought. The reform discourse of recent years has largely focused on expanding investigative powers, to the possible detriment of the protection of individual rights. Whilst the present environment makes such a focus wholly understandable, the present paper considers potential legislative and policy measures that could strengthen the proportionality principle in the telecommunications regulatory framework to support a more precise calibration of the relevant competing public and private interests. As Australia has recently undertaken a comprehensive review of its telecommunications access and interception laws, commencing with a 2013 <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> its Senate <b>Committee</b> and culminating in a 2015 law reform report, the article focuses on that nation's experience. The analysis is, however, placed within an overarching public policy framework to ensure that the discussion is of relevance to nations around the world who are similarly engaged in telecommunications law reform. 18 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to describe and}} assess the legal position in respect of guidelines, directives, manuals and similar instruments issued by administrative authorities. It first reviews the statutory or other legal basis for the power to issue such instruments. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the recognition by the courts of an implicit authority to formulate instructions to subordinate officials, as part of general managing and supervisory powers. The author then outlines the specific features of directives, as compared with regulations. Both classes of instruments usually contain rules of fairly general application. Both can be seen as useful means of structuring the exercice of discretionary decision-making powers. Directives, guidelines, manuals and the like, however, set a particular emphasis on the provision of guidance or even imperative instructions for officials in the discharge of their duties, while regulations apply just as statutes do, to the general public as well as to civil servants. Great weight —perhaps an excessive weight — was attached to this distinction in the reasons of Pigeon J. in the first Martineau case, which is discussed at some length. The question of unpublished directives becoming in fact a body of « secret law » is then surveyed. The limited scope of the federal Statutory Instruments Act in this respect is underlined, and the author argues for selective adoption of public rule-making procedures, requirements for publication in official gazettes, and <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> parliamentary <b>committees.</b> Finally, the paper surveys the present state of the law as regards judicial review of directives. While review may bear on the vires for the making of the directive, much {{as in the case of}} regulations, it more often occurs when a discretionary decision is challenged before the courts on the grounds that the decision-maker fettered its own discretion by inflexibly applying self-made guidelines where individual determination was called for, or by submitting to directives from some other authority. In cases where judicial intervention is not possible, recourse may be had to ombudsmen ; the experience of the Public Protector in Quebec in connection with directives and guidelines is described...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{document}} {{the number and}} pattern of psychiatric and psychosocial <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> community resources by family physicians (FPs) and <b>to</b> determine whether <b>referral</b> practices correlate with physician variables. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of <b>referrals</b> by FPs <b>to</b> 34 key psychiatric and psychosocial community resources identified {{by a panel of}} FPs, psychiatric social workers, psychiatric nurses, public health nurses, and the local community information service. SETTING: Regional municipality of 434, 000 persons in Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven of 34 (79 %) community agencies identified 261 FPs who made 4487 <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> participating agencies (range 0 to 65, median 15, mean 17. 19 +/- 13. 42). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> all agencies; variables, such as physician sex, school of graduation, year of graduation, and certificate status in the College of Family Physicians of Canada, related <b>to</b> <b>referral</b> patterns. RESULTS: <b>Referrals</b> <b>to</b> outpatient psychiatric clinics, support services, and general counseling services accounted for 96 % of all referrals. Physicians' average annual referral profile was as follows: 8. 6 patients to a support service, 6. 3 to an outpatient psychiatric service, 1. 6 to a counseling service, and 0. 46 to a substance abuse service. Referral profiles of individual physicians varied greatly. Female FPs made fewer referrals than male FPs to support services, but both made similar numbers of <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> psychiatric, counseling, and substance abuse services. The more recent the year of graduation, the greater the number of <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> psychiatric (r = 0. 158, P = 0. 0107) and counseling services (r = 0. 137, P = 0. 0272) and the higher the fraction of <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> psychiatric services (r = 0. 286, P = 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Family physicians in Hamilton-Wentworth made few <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> psychiatric and psychosocial services. Only physician sex and year of graduation correlated significantly with numbers of referrals made. Recent graduates of both sexes made significantly more <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> psychiatric clinics and counseling services than their older colleagues...|$|R
