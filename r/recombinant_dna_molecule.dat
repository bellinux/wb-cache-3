50|$|Once the Hershey-Chase {{experiment}} was published, {{the scientific community}} generally acknowledged that DNA was the genetic code material. This discovery led to a more detailed investigation of DNA to determine its composition {{as well as its}} 3D structure. Using X-ray crystallography, the structure of DNA was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick with the help of previously documented experimental evidence by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin.Knowledge of the structure of DNA led scientists to examine the nature of genetic coding and, in turn, understand the process of protein synthesis. George Gamow proposed that the genetic code was composed of sequences of three DNA base pairs known as triplets or codons which represent one of the twenty amino acids. Genetic coding helped researchers to understand the mechanism of gene expression, the process by which information from a gene is used in protein synthesis. Since then, much research has been conducted to modulate steps in the gene expression process. These steps include transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification which are used to control the chemical and structural nature of proteins. Moreover, genetic engineering gives engineers the ability to directly manipulate the genetic materials of organisms using recombinant DNA techniques.

Even if the histones are first stabilized in octameric form by dimethylsuberimidate cross-linking they are still unable to form specific complexes with the RNA. Moreover double-stranded RNA is unable to induce histones to assemble into octamers although we confirm that the non-nucleic acid homopolymer, polyglutamic acid, has this ability. We have also determined, using pyrimidine tract analysis, that nucleosomes will not form over a sufficiently long segment of poly(dA). poly(dT) in a <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>molecule.</b> Thus nucleosomes cannot fold DNA containing an 80 base pair poly(dA). poly(dT) segment but a 20 base pair segment can be accommodated in nucleosomes fairly well.

40|$|<b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>molecule</b> of phage lambda {{formed in}} Escherichia coli in the {{presence}} of chloramphenicol and/or rifampin can be assayed by their biological activity. recA- cells were found to be capable of forming recombinant lambda phage DNA {{in the presence}} of chloramphenicol. The relatively high recA-independent recombination observed in this system contrasts with the relatively low recA-independent recombination when recombinant phage particles rather than recombinant DNA are titrated. Formation of the recombinant DNA was suppressed by the the addition of rifampin. The introduction of the rif-r mutation into host bacteria made their recombination activity rifampin-resistant. These results show that DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (EC 2. 7. 7. 6) is involved in this recA-independent pathway of recombination, which is named the "Rpo pathway. " This is distinct from Red, Int, RecBC, RecE, or Der pathways of recombination. Crossover was much more frequent in the N-PL-cI and cI-PR-O regions than in the A-D and O-S regions.

Introduction of the recombinant DNA into nuclei of baby hamster kidney cells {{results in the}} synthesis of authentic SFV membrane glycoproteins E 1 and E 2. The glycoproteins are both transported to the cell surface and induce cell- cell fusion after a brief treatment of the cells with low pH medium. The pH dependence of the fusion reaction {{was the same as}} that induced by virus particles (White, J., J. Kartenbeck, and A. Helenius, 1980, J. Cell Biol., 89 : 674 - 679). Transfection of cells with another <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>molecule</b> in which the SFV cDNA is engineered into the same expression vector including an intron has been shown before to result in the expression of only the E 2 protein on the cell surface, whereas the E 1 protein is trapped in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Kondor- Koch, C., H.

High molecular weight DNAs isolated from cell lines established from carcinomas and sarcomas of various organs {{as well as}} from a glioblastoma and two melanomas were utilized to transfect NIH/ 3 T 3 mouse fibroblasts. The DNAs of T 24 and A 2182, two cell lines derived from a bladder and a lung carcinoma, respectively, and of HT- 1080, a cell line established from a fibrosarcoma, were able to transform recipient NIH/ 3 T 3 cells. First-cycle transformants exhibited anchorage-independent growth and were tumorigenic in athymic and immunocompetent mice. Moreover, they contained human DNA sequences and were able to transmit their malignant phenotype in additional cycles of transfection. Southern blot analysis of T 24 -derived transformants showed that a single fragment of human DNA specifically cosegregated with the malignant phenotype, suggesting that it contained the T 24 oncogene. Therefore, these human sequences were molecularly cloned with lambda Charon 9 A as the cloning vector.

40|$|Natural {{transformation}} {{is the process}} by which cells take up DNA from the surrounding medium under physiological conditions, altering the genotype in a heritable fashion. This occurs without chemical or physical treatment of the cells. Certain Acinetobacter strains exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate homologous DNA into their chromosomes by natural transformation. Transformation in Acinetobacter exhibits several unique properties that indicate this system's superiority as a model for transformation studies or studies which benefit from the use of transformation as an experimental method of gene manipulation. Pseudomonas putida is the natural host of TOL plasmids, ranging between 50 kbp and 300 kbp in size and encoding genes for the catabolism of toluene, meta-toluate, and xylene. These very large, single-copy plasmids are difficult to isolate, manipulate, or modify in vitro. In this study, the TOL plasmid pDKR 1 was introduced into Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strains and genetically engineered utilizing natural transformation as part of the process. Following engineering by transformation, the <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>molecule</b> was returned to the native genetic background of the original host P. putida strain. Specific parameters for the successful manipulation of large plasmids by natural transformation in Acinetobacter were identified and are outlined. The effects of growth phase, total transforming DNA concentration, transforming DNA conformation, and gene dosage on transformation efficiency are presented. Addition of Acinetobacter plasmid DNA sequences to the manipulated constructs did not have an effect on transformation rates. Results suggest that a broadly applicable and efficient method to carry out site-directed genetic manipulations of large plasmids has been identified.

40|$|Ectopic gene {{targeting}} {{is an alternative}} outcome of the {{gene targeting}} {{process in which the}} targeting vector acquires sequences from the genomic target but proceeds to integrate elsewhere in the genome. To explore this mechanism of recombination an assay was developed, designated as Recombination Access Mapping (RAM), that uses ectopic gene targeting coupled with two color FISH analysis. Using RAM, the integration sites of the gene targeting vector with respect to the target locus were determined for ectopic gene targeting in a murine fibroblast cell line (LTA). The distribution of integration sites was found to be bimodal during ectopic gene targeting, being either within 2 [...] 3 Mb of the target or on distinct chromosomes from the chromosome carrying the target locus. Both inter and intrachromosomal sites appeared to be equally accessible to the targeting vector with site specific variations. In contrast, illegitimate integration of a transgene was found to occur randomly in the LTA cell line. Interestingly, interphase analysis indicated that vector sequences which had integrated ectopically in other chromosomes than the target co-localized with the target locus at a significant frequency as compared to random unlinked loci. Mechanistically, the homologous recombination event that produces the extrachromosomal <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>molecule,</b> following ectopic gene targeting or interplasmid recombination, was demonstrated to potentiate or commit the recombinant DNA to integration in the genome at the site of a double-strand break (DSB). This data suggests that extrachromosomal and chromosomal DSB repair are coupled, and therefore the integration site of the transgene during ectopic gene targeting is most likely a DSB in close proximity spatially to the target locus. The conclusion of this thesis is that RAM can be used to determine which chromosomal domains within the genome are accessible to a given genetic locus. Thus, RAM presents a new paradigm for the analysis of D...|$|E
