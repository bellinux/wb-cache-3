40|$|Profitability of <b>recirculating</b> <b>systems</b> {{depends in}} part on the ability to manage {{nutrient}} wastes. Nitrogenous wastes in these systems can be eliminated through nitrifying and denitrifying biofilters. While nitrifying filters are incorporated in most <b>recirculating</b> <b>systems</b> according to well-established protocols, denitrifying filters are still under development. By means of denitrification, oxidized inorganic nitrogen compounds, such as nitrite and nitrate are reduced to elemental nitrogen (N 2). The process is conducted by facultative anaerobic microorganisms with electron donors derived from either organic (heterotrophic denitrification) or inorganic sources (autotrophic denitrification). In <b>recirculating</b> <b>systems</b> and traditional wastewater treatment plants, heterotrophic denitrification often is applied using external electron and carbon donors (e. g. carbohydrates, organic alcohols) or endogenous organic donors originating from the waste. In addition to nitrate removal, denitrifying organisms are associated with other processes relevant to water quality control in aquaculture systems. Denitrification raises the alkalinity and, hence, replenishes some of the inorganic carbon lost through nitrification. Organic carbon discharge from <b>recirculating</b> <b>systems</b> is reduced when endogenous carbon sources originating from the fish waste are used to fuel denitrification. In addition to the carbon cycle, denitrifiers also are associated with sulfur and phosphorus cycles in <b>recirculating</b> <b>systems.</b> Orthophosphate uptake by some denitrifiers takes place in excess of their metabolic requirements and may result in a considerable reduction of orthophosphate from the culture water. Finally, autotrophic denitrifiers may prevent the accumulation of toxic sulfide resultin...|$|R

Microbiological assays were performed on the water used to prepare dialysis fluid, the concentrated dialysate, and either pre- and postdialyzer dialysate (single-pass systems) or the dialysate contained in storage reservoirs and <b>recirculating</b> cannisters (<b>recirculating</b> <b>systems).</b> The levels of microbial contamination consisting of gram-negative bacteria were {{directly related to the}} type of dialysis system, method of water treatment, distribution system, and in some instances, the type of dialyzer.
