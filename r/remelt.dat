40|$|The laser <b>remelting</b> {{process is}} a very {{promising}} hardening method for ferrous and non-ferrous alloys which do not show a homogeneous microstructural state after being heat treated in a traditional way. Consequently, the alloys concerned do not achieve the required hardness of the surface layer and do notprovide the required wear resistance. The present paper deals with residualstress and strain changes in thin flat specimens of nodular cast iron 500 - 7 in the laser <b>remelting</b> process. In the process of gradual <b>remelting</b> of the specimen surface, i. e. during its heating and cooling, volume changes in the specimen occur due to thermal and microstructural changes. To {{find out more about}} volume changes in the thin surface layer of specimens, the latter were monitored by strain measurement at the lower side of the specimens duringthe <b>remelting</b> process and by residual stress measurement in the thin surface layer after the <b>remelting</b> process. The strain was measured using a resistance rosette, placed {{on the opposite side of}} the <b>remelted</b> layer, and the temperature was measured in the same place simultaneously. In laser <b>remelting</b> of a workpiece, such <b>remelting</b> conditions should ensure that a uniform thickness of the modified layer is obtained, in spite of several laserbeam passages across the workpiece surface. Owing to the multiple passageof the laser beam across the workpiece surface, the state of internal stress in the workpiece changes and, consequently, undesired strain may occur. Such strain may result in greater consumption of material and additional machining which, in turn, may result in higher cost of the machined parts. The results obtained confirmed that on the basis of knowing the strain occurring during the <b>remelting</b> process and the residual stress, the process could be successfully optimised.
