While commutators are segmented, <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> are continuous, and the terms are not interchangeable. Rotary transformers are often used instead of <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> in high-speed or low-friction environments.|$|R

40|$|A {{phase lock}} servo system is {{described}} for synchronizing {{the rotation of}} a <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly with the rotation of an air bearing table so that a minimum of torque will be imparted through cables extending from the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly to the air bearing table as such is rotated. The system includes two servo loops. The first servo loop includes a rate gyroscope carried on the air bearing table which generates a signal through a summing junction to be compared with a signal coming from a tachometer coupled to the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly. The corrective signal is applied to a torque motor for rotating the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly. The second servo loop includes a pair of photo detector cells which generate pulses responsive to {{the rotation of the}} air bearing table and <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly which are fed through a phase detector, and a variable gain amplifier to the summing junction circuit to provide a fine adjustment for rotating the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly...|$|R

50|$|Wireless <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> do {{not rely}} on the typical {{friction}} based metal and carbon brush contact methods that have been employed by <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> since their invention, such as those explored above. Instead, they transfer both power and data wirelessly via an electromagnetic field, which is created by the coils that are placed in the rotating receiver, and the stationary transmitter. Wireless <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> are considered an upgrade from - or alternative to - traditional <b>slip</b> <b>rings,</b> as their lack of standard mechanical rotating parts means they're typically more resilient in harsh operating environments, and require less maintenance and upkeep. However, the amount of power that can be transmitted between coils is limited; typically a traditional contact-type <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> can transmit orders of magnitude more power in the same volume.|$|R
50|$|This {{mechanism}} is intended {{as an alternative}} to the usual method of supplying electric power to a rotating device, the use of <b>slip</b> <b>rings.</b> The <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> are attached to one part of the machine, and a set of fine metal brushes are attached to the other part. The brushes are kept in sliding contact with the <b>slip</b> <b>rings,</b> providing an electrical path between the two parts while allowing the parts to rotate about each other.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{electrical}} commutators use <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> for coupling. <b>Slip</b> <b>rings</b> however inject commutator noise {{into the}} connection. This is because as the contact points slide {{over the surface}} of the slip-rings they make microscopic bumps. The resultant variation in resistance and inductance causes electrical noise in the circuit. To reduce the electrical noise the contact points need to be pressed against the <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> with greater force. This leads to great resistance and a higher rate of wear.|$|R

40|$|The Seasat {{spacecraft}} failed on October 9, 1978, after satisfactory {{operation in}} orbit for 105 days, {{as a result}} of a loss of electrical power in the Agena bus that was used as a part of the spacecraft. This loss of power was caused by a massive and progressive short in one of the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assemblies that was used to connect the rotating solar arrays into the power subsystem. The most likely cause of this short was the initiation of an arc between adjacent <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> brush assemblies. The triggering mechanism of this arc could have been either a wire-to-brush assembly contact, a brush-to-brush contact, or a momentary short caused by a contaminant that bridged internal components of opposite electrical polarity. The <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly, as used in the Seasat spacecraft, was connected into the power subsystem in such a way that most of the adjacent brush assemblies were of opposite electrical polarity. This wiring arrangement, together with the congested nature of the design itself, made the Seasat <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly a unique, first-of-a-kind component that was particularly prone to shorting. The possibility of <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> failures resulting from placing opposite electrical polarities on adjacent brush assemblies was known at least as early-as the summer of 1977 to other projects within the contractor's organization. Furthermore, failures of <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assemblies due to shorting between brushes had been experienced by the prime contractor on <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assemblies used by other programs. That the Seasat organization was not fully aware of these potential failure modes was due to a breakdown in communication within the contractor's organization...|$|R

40|$|Ball Aerospace {{experience}} with <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> in space extends back to 1962. Over 40 multi-ring assemblies have been flown and continuous operating lifetimes greater than 8 years {{at up to}} 60 rpm have been demonstrated. <b>Slip</b> <b>rings</b> provide multi-channel transfer of electrical power and signals in assemblies that are small in size and weight, and low in cost. By use of multiple brushes and sufficient copper within the assembly, power transfer efficiency better than 99. 95 percent for high voltage circuits can be achieved. A low <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> failure rate based on actual space operation totalling billions of ring revolutions has been established. Well qualified suppliers who have been making <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> for space use for over 25 years are available.

50|$|OEM {{machinery}} {{manufacturers are}} discovering {{the benefits of}} using a mercury swivel commutator in their designs. For example packaging machines use some type of commutator or <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> as {{a connection to the}} moving parts that are heated to seal the packages closed after they are filled. It is critical that the temperature sensing circuit be reliable and accurate. Unfortunately, using a <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly or standard electrical <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> may cause problems due to electrical noise and degradation of signal produced by the rubbing contacts of the <b>slip</b> <b>rings.</b> Many OEM machinery manufacturers have switched to using mercury swivel commutators for reliable and accurate temperature control. It is also desirable to pass the power and the temperature signal through the same rotating electrical connector in order to minimize the number of connector parts that must be built into the machine. Multiple channel mercury swivel commutators are used for this purpose.|$|R

50|$|Mercury-wetted <b>slip</b> <b>rings,</b> {{noted for}} their low {{resistance}} and stable connection {{use a different}} principle which replaces the sliding brush contact with a pool of liquid metal molecularly bonded to the contacts.

If a <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> application involves food manufacturing or processing, pharmaceutical equipment, or any other use where contamination could be a serious threat, the choice should be precious metal contacts. Leakage of the mercury and the resultant contamination could be extremely serious. The <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> device is also limited by temperature, as mercury solidifies at approximately -40 °C.|$|R

Historically, these systems made use of electromechanical <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> for the transfer of power, control, and data from within the helicopter's cabin to the rotating hardware. <b>Slip</b> <b>rings</b> are primarily used in dedicated instrumentation vehicles and are not commonly used in production platforms that may require instrumentation of the rotating systems for in-service load and fatigue monitoring.
