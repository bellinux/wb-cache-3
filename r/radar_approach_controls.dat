40|$|The Surface Management System (SMS) is a {{decision}} support tool that helps tower traffic coordinators and Ground/Local controllers manage and control airport surface traffic {{in order to increase}} capacity, efficiency, and flexibility. SMS provides common situation awareness to personnel at various air traffic control facilities such as air traffic control towers (ATCTs), airline ramp towers, the Terminal <b>Radar</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Controls</b> (TRACONs), and Air Route Traffic Control Centers. SMS also provides a traffic management tool to assist ATCT traffic management coordinators in making decisions regarding airport configuration and runway load balancing. The Build 1 of the SMS tool was successfully tested at Memphis International Airport. This paper reports the recent development efforts performed to integrate SMS with the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS) Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) to improve its prediction accuracy for arrival traffic and robustness under modeling uncertainties. The preliminary analysis results performed on the traffic data at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport have shown significant improvements in predicting runway assignment, runway arrival time, and arrival demand.

The Administrator consulted with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on alternatives for continuing the necessary air traffic services provided by the Fort Sill ARAC before implementing any modifications to the current operations. Under the agreement, the Army will continue to operate the Fort Sill Army <b>Radar</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Control</b> (ARAC) until three months after the Air Force installs a new digital radar in the Lawton-Fort Sill area, and a new advanced <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> automation system at Sheppard Air Force Base can provide full display of the data from the new Lawton-Fort Sill radar.
