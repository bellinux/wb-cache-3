40|$|Abstract—In this work, several ASP {{solutions}} were flooded into fractured models initially {{saturated with}} heavy oil {{at a constant}} flow rate and different geometrical characteristics of fracture. The ASP solutions are constituted from 2 polymers i. e. a synthetic polymer, hydrolyzed polyacrylamide {{as well as a}} biopolymer, a surfactant and 2 types of alkaline. The results showed that using synthetic hydrolyzed polyacrylamide polymer increases ultimate oil recovery; however, type of alkaline does not play a significant <b>rule</b> <b>on</b> oil <b>recovery.</b> In addition, position of the injection well respect to the fracture system has remarkable effects on ASP flooding. For instance increasing angle of fractures with mean flow direction causes more oil recovery and delays breakthrough time. This work can be accounted as a comprehensive survey on ASP flooding which considers most of effective factors in this chemical EOR method...|$|R
500|$|NASA {{announced}} {{the first two}} orbital missions {{at the end of}} November 1961, shortly after the Mercury-Atlas 5 (MA-5) test flight, which had carried a chimpanzee and twice orbited the Earth. MA-6 was planned as the first orbital flight, with John Glenn as the primary crew and Scott Carpenter as his backup. The follow-up mission, MA-7 was to be crewed by Deke Slayton, with Wally Schirra as his backup. In February 1962, the first draft planning began for MA-8, the third orbital mission, with a goal of [...] "six or seven" [...] orbits, as an intermediate step towards a day-long 18-orbit flight. The decision to move to six orbits rather than seven was driven by the mission <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> contingency <b>recovery</b> operations; a seventh orbit would have required significant additional recovery forces to be able to reach the capsule anywhere on its trajectory within eighteen hours. The six-orbit profile had other effects <b>on</b> the <b>recovery</b> plans; the optimum recovery point was moved to the Pacific Ocean, rather than the Atlantic.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. I {{studied a}} {{long-term}} data set for Wandering Albatrosses Diomedea exulans collected at sub-Antarctic Marion Island to investigate adult survival, breeding biology and factors affecting reproductive {{success of this}} long-lived pelagic seabird. Until recently, the complex adult life cycle has caused biases in conventional mark-recapture modelling analyses that assume that recapture probability is equal for 'observable' and 'unobservable' states of the biennial adult life cycle. During 'sabbaticals' taken after successful and late-failed breeding attempts, the chances of resighting an adult Wandering Albatrosses are reduced, thus affecting estimated recapture rates. I applied a multi-state mark-recapture method to the colony breeding data from Marion Island (1987 - 2005). This method allows individual albatrosses to move through a network of breeding states according to previous breeding history using transition probabilities to estimate survival, breeding and breeding success probability. The best fit models in the multi-state analysis were those representing constant survival and independent breeding probabilities, suggesting that Wandering Albatrosses constrain reproductive investment to ensure long-term survival. I used the parameter estimates in a transition matrix to calculate the steady state equilibrium for the Wandering Albatross breeding population. For the first time I was able to estimate that approximately 3000 pairs of Wandering Albatrosses use Marion Island for nesting. I also describe the effects of age, sex and experience on Wandering Albatross reproductive success. Birds that were most successful began breeding at {{the mean age of}} first breeding and older and younger birds were less successful in 5 / 10 year periods after the onset of breeding. Disappearance from the population decreased with an increase of age of first breeding. I tested the selection and experience hypotheses on birds with 'complete' histories defined according to an imposed <b>rule</b> <b>on</b> <b>recovery</b> data. Males appeared to increase breeding success as a result of selective removal of low-quality individuals from the population (the selection hypothesis), whereas females appeared to improve their breeding success as a result of increased experience...|$|R

Data were gathered on perceived justice with service recovery, corporate image and recovery satisfaction by means of survey from Iran Air customers who experienced a service failure within last year. The results show that distributive and interactional justices have significant effects <b>on</b> <b>recovery</b> satisfaction. The effect of distributive justice <b>on</b> <b>recovery</b> satisfaction was stronger than interactional justice. Additionally, hierarchical regression analyses suggested that corporate image plays a moderating role between perceived justice and recovery satisfaction in the distributive and interactional justice dimensions.
