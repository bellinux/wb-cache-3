5000|$|The <b>receiving</b> <b>community</b> does pose some {{difficulties}} for the repatriates {{but it also}} poses some threat to the local people as well. The local for instance considers the repatriates as [...] "other" [...] and [...] "not authentic" [...] co-ethnics. Moreover, the repatriates also undergo several complaints by the local communities as the seem to see the treatment towards the repatriates as unfair in many ways and seem to only be sharing ethnicity within their own name only. Apart from that, as the social cleavage still prevails and exists, the linguistic cleavage does at the same time. Here we are speaking about the dominant Russian-speaking dominance over the Kazakh-speaking people, where {{for most of the}} people the gradual shift to the Russian language is more preferred and received. As a result of that, the cultural division also {{plays an important role in}} the nation-building process and needs to be taken not lightly into consideration. Furthermore, we may also one other factor that comes here into play. The idea that the repatriates see themselves as the true and genuine people who have been able to preserve the pure Kazakhness even abroad for a long period of time, often boast themselves with self-confidence and self-identification over the local Kazakh people. This self-identified image of the repatriates might further alienate them from the local community and of its perception. Even if the public was general discontent with the nation-building process towards the integration of the Kazakh repatriates was strong, there was no real widespread cultural or ethnical conflicts to be seen, as the non-Kazakh minorities as well as with the other Kazakh citizens did not object the Kazakh-oriented state building process. One other aspect that still gives this process impetus is the absence of political counterforce towards the migratory policies and it seems unlikely that this process will be hindered completely and will so to say be continuing in the future. The quote by Natsuko Oka describes the importance of this issue and of its weight on the Kazakh community as well as for its state and it goes as follows: [...] "Having defined itself as the state for all Kazakhs of the world, Kazakhstan has entitled co-ethnics with the right of return to their ancestral homeland to become full-fledged citizens. If the government declares that the state cannot accept ethnic brethren any more, such a decision will surely invite severe criticism from Kazakh nationalists as well as immigrants, who will readily cast the ruling elites as traitors to the Kazakh nation. On the other hand, instability in the society will only grow worse if new immigrants continue to arrive while the integration of those who already have settled barely proceeds, and their social problems remain unsolved. Kazakhstan finds itself caught in a dilemma: because of its ethnic roots and de-colonization agenda, Kazakh repatriation policy cannot be easily abandoned even if it creates more problems than benefits." ...|$|E

Everyday activities, benefits and practices [...] Chapter 4. Mentoring bonds [...] Chapter 5. Fractured bonds, bridges and challenges [...] Chapter 6. Discussion, conclusion and recommendations. The relationship between refugees and their <b>receiving</b> <b>community</b> {{is an area}} requiring further investigation and research. This thesis examines refugee monitoring through {{a case study of}} the Tibetan Mentoring Program, based in the Northern Beaches of Sydney. My research question is "How might mentoring assist integration of refugees in Australia?" The study has two aims: firstly, to better understand what contributes to good mentoring relationships and why they sometimes fail; and secondly to understand what mentoring brings to the refugee resettlement experience. A qualitative research methodology was used, including interviews with mentor and mentees, a focus group, and ethnography. The research aims to add to limited literature on how the <b>receiving</b> <b>community</b> can assist refugee settlement. A key hook is exploring and interrogating the role of the <b>receiving</b> <b>community</b> and possibilities of welcome or unwelcome thrown open by refugee mentoring programs. I argue care must be taken to unpack the romantic notions attributed to mentoring and I contend {{there is a need for}} theoretical development of refugee mentoring. Everyday social connections and ontological security enable a sense of belonging, and the forging of these emotional connections are examined. Also explored, the nature of the bonds formed in the mentoring relationship and how mentors and mentees interplay, symbolise and construct their cultural identity. In other words, how the mentoring relationship is constructed, shaken and contested between mentors and mentees. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (88 pages) colour illustration...|$|E
