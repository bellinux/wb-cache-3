5|$|Russia {{continued}} {{to maintain a}} single checkpoint in the border village of Perevi. On 12 December, <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> withdrew; eight hours later they re-entered the village and Georgian police withdrew after the Russians threatened to fire. <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> then set up three checkpoints in the village. On 18 October 2010 all Russian troops in Perevi withdrew to South Ossetia and a Georgian Army unit moved in.|$|E
5|$|<b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> {{advanced}} into western Georgia from Abkhazia on 11 August. This {{marked the}} opening of a new front. Russian troops captured the police stations in Zugdidi despite earlier Russian official claims of not intending to expand assault to Georgia proper. <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> reached the town of Senaki that day and captured a military base there.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August, Medvedev {{announced}} that <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> {{would begin to}} pull out of Georgia the following day. The two countries exchanged prisoners of war on 19 August. A Georgian official said that although his country exchanged five Russian servicemen for fifteen Georgians, among them two civilians, Georgia suspected that Russia still held two more Georgians. On 22 August, <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> withdrew from Igoeti and the Georgian police proceeded towards Gori. Russia claimed that its military withdrawal was completed; however, Russian checkpoints remained near Gori and two Russian lookout stations remained near Poti. On 13 September, Russian troops began withdrawing from western Georgia and by 11:00 Moscow Time, the posts near Poti were abandoned. Withdrawals from Senaki and Khobi also took place. <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> withdrew from the buffer zones adjacent to Abkhazia and South Ossetia on 8 October and authority over them was transferred to the European Union monitoring mission in Georgia.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Russian</b> Space <b>Forces</b> (Космические войска России) are {{a branch}} of the <b>Russian</b> Aerospace <b>Forces,</b> having been {{reestablished}} following the 1 August 2015 merger between the <b>Russian</b> Air <b>Force</b> and the <b>Russian</b> Aerospace Defence <b>Forces</b> after a 2011 dissolving of the branch. The <b>Russian</b> Space <b>Forces</b> were originally formed on the 10 August 1992 and the creation of the <b>Russian</b> Armed <b>Forces.</b> The organisation shared control of the Baikonur Cosmodrome with the Russian Federal Space Agency.

5|$|From 27 May to 4 July, Wettin {{was back}} in the North Sea, patrolling the mouths of the Jade, Ems, and Elbe rivers. During this period, the naval high command {{realized}} that the old Wittelsbach-class ships would be useless in action against the Royal Navy, but could be effectively used against the much weaker <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> in the Baltic. As a result, the ships were transferred back to the Baltic in July, and they departed Kiel on the 7th, bound for Danzig. On 10 July, the ships proceeded further east to Neufahrwassar, along with the VIII Torpedo-boat Flotilla. The IV Squadron ships sortied on 12 July to make a demonstration, returning to Danzig on 21 July without encountering <b>Russian</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hostilities {{began in}} October 1632 when <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> tried {{to capture the}} city of Smolensk. Small {{military}} engagements produced mixed results for both sides, but the surrender of the main Russian force in February 1634 led to the Treaty of Polyanovka. Russia accepted Polish-Lithuanian control over the Smolensk region, which lasted for another 20years.|$|E

5|$|Both {{ships of}} the class were {{stationed}} in Crete after they entered service, to assist in stabilizing the island {{in the aftermath of}} the Cretan Revolt of 18661869. Nevertheless, the Ottoman fleet remained largely inactive during this period. Both ships saw action during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where they operated against <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> in the Black Sea. At the start of the war, Lüft-ü Celil and Hifz-ur Rahman were assigned to the Danube Squadron, where they were tasked with preventing <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> from crossing the river. While on patrol on 11 May 1877, Lüft-ü Celil engaged a Russian artillery battery, and one of the Russian shells struck the vessel, probably in the boiler room, where it caused a large explosion that destroyed the ship, killing most of her crew. Hifz-ur Rahman later assisted in the defense of Sulina at the mouth of the Danube, and engaged Russian minelayers in an action on 9 November 1877 where she was lightly damaged.|$|E

5|$|Polish forces, {{numbering}} 5,500–7,300, faced <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> numbering {{over half}} of the 46th Corps of 26,000. The Polish forces were eventually forced to retreat, but delayed the Russians long enough for the other Austro-Hungarian units in the area to retreat in an organized manner.

5|$|The {{unexpected}} French advance {{from the}} west and the fall of the Shevardino redoubt threw the Russian formation into disarray.

5|$|After {{the start}} of World War I in August 1914, Wittelsbach was brought back to active duty in the IV Battle Squadron. The ship saw limited duty in the Baltic Sea, {{including}} during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, but she saw no combat with <b>Russian</b> <b>forces.</b> By late 1915, crew shortages and the threat from British submarines forced the Kaiserliche Marine to withdraw older battleships like Wittelsbach. The ship then saw service in auxiliary roles, first as a training ship {{and then as a}} ship's tender. After the war, she was converted into a tender for minesweepers in 1919. In July 1921, the ship was sold and broken up for scrap metal.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ark Royal transported {{aircraft}} {{across the}} Black Sea to Batumi, {{where they were}} ferried across the Caucasus to the British naval forces supporting White <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> fighting the Bolsheviks in the Caspian Sea during the Russian Civil War. The ship was withdrawn from the Black Sea in late 1919 and disembarked her seaplanes at Malta to load a dozen de Havilland DH-9 bombers and 181 personnel of the supporting Z Force for transport to British Somaliland. The ship arrived in Berbera on 30 December and the squadron was unloaded to support the air and land campaign against the Mad Mullah. Ark Royal served during this campaign solely as a depot and repair ship for the RAF. She was withdrawn before its conclusion and transferred to the Black Sea to support the White <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> there {{as they began to}} collapse. The ship twice ferried refugees from the Caucasian coast to the Crimea and, after the second voyage, had to be fumigated at Constantinople after an outbreak of typhus among her passengers. During the summer of 1920, Ark Royal ferried RAF aircraft and personnel to Basra. She then returned to Britain for a refit and was put into reserve at Rosyth in November.|$|E
5|$|Although the Polish {{division}} was defeated, the <b>Russian</b> <b>forces</b> did not pursue. This allowed the Poles {{to mount a}} night counterattack. A single machine gun battalion attacked a position behind Radzymin. While ultimately unsuccessful, the battalion forced the Russian troops to remain stationary overnight, giving the Poles badly needed time to regroup and receive reinforcements, which {{came in the form}} of a single regiment from the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division. Instead of retreating to the third line of defences, the Poles remained outside the town, hoping to retake it the following day.|$|E
