40|$|The {{metal dusting}} {{behavior}} of three ferrous alloys with varying Cr content (2. 3 %, 8. 6 %, and 20. 1 % by weight) {{has been studied}} in carbonaceous atmospheres where the activity of carbon is greater than 1. Failures due <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting</b> {{have been reported in}} petrochemical, chemical industries, nuclear reactors and solid oxide fuel cells. It is estimated that financial losses in hydrogen industry alone due <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting</b> related maintenance problems is estimated to be around $ 300 million annually. Two atmospheres with varying water vapor contents (23 and 2. 3 %) have been used for the study to understand the role of vapor during metal dusting. ^ Low Cr alloy, T 22, showed extensive surface degradation and pitting, while increasing Cr content showed improved <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting</b> for T 91 (medium Cr) and 800 (high Cr) alloys due to the formation of protective Cr 2 O 3 scales early during metal <b>dusting.</b> <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting</b> also improved in atmosphere with higher vapor content. Presence of high vapor content in the atmosphere favors the formation of protective Cr 2 O 3 scales early during metal dusting and these scales not only delay the ingress of carbon into the alloy matrix but also offer <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> carbon diffusion thus improving the overall resistance of the alloys against metal dusting. ^ A combination of high Cr content in the alloy and high vapor content in the atmosphere is favorable for formation of protective Cr 2 O 3 scales early during metal dusting and this improves the resistance of the alloys <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting</b> corrosion. ...|$|R

Alternatively, factors like the multiplicity of gestures or aesthetics are less dominant. The intuitiveness of control by the user is a particularly relevant and specific objective of our work. While multiactivation-modalities prostheses use sophisticated myoelectric control to afford versatility and dexterity, most state-of-the-art work-oriented prostheses are body powered (BP). BP prostheses (BPPs) are intuitive to use, have low cost, do not require batteries or motors, and provide useful built-in, sensorless feedback to the user...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} carburising furnace {{in which}} metal dusting conditions are simulated {{has been designed}} and constructed. This furnace {{has been used to}} simulate and study the metal dusting corrosion of four iron-based alloys viz. 9 Cr Mo 45 steel, Incoloy 800 H, AISI 310 stainless steel and Chromanite - an experimental high-nitrogen Cr-Mn stainless steel (HNSS). Tests conducted on the carburising furnace show that the rig is capable of heating a flowing gas environment to temperatures of 800 °C in the horizontal ceramic tube. The design allows the testing of up to thirty-six test specimens in a constanttemperature test zone. Systems for the safe heating and disposal of gases such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide have been incorporated into the design. Four twenty-four hour exposures were performed on specimens of the CrMo steel and as received samples of AISI 310. This was followed by a series of seven week-long exposures of Incoloy 800 H, AISI 310 and the high nitrogen stainless steel (HNSS). These specimens were tested in an annealed and polished condition in order to increase their susceptibility <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting.</b> In a third test series, specimens of these three alloys were tested in an annealed and abraded condition {{in order to determine the}} effect of grain size and surface roughness on metal dusting resistance. Exposures of the CrMo specimens resulted in general metal loss and massive carbon deposition after the first exposure of 24 hours. Filamentous carbon deposits containing metal particles showed that metal dusting corrosion of the specimens had taken place. The as received AISI 310 specimens showed no signs of metal dusting attack over the same exposure time. This was attributed to a protective surface chromia layer that prevented carburisation of the specimens. During the second test series, specimens of Incoloy 800 H in the sensitised condition showed a high susceptibility <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting.</b> Carburisation of the matrix carburisation was accompanied by large carbon protrusions growing from the specimens' surfaces. Large pits were observed on the specimens after five weeks. Sensitised AISI 310 specimens also showed signs of metal dusting but at a slower rate. The difference in performance between these two alloys was attributed to the difference in alloying contents, notably chromium, nickel and silicon. The HNSS specimens showed a high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> carburisation, carbon deposition and metal loss during the first six weeks. Small amounts of carbon deposition and pitting were observed after the seventh exposure. The good <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting</b> of this alloy was attributed to its alloying contents, which included chromium, manganese, sulphur and nitrogen. The results of the third test senes showed that <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting</b> was significantly improved by increasing the surface roughness and decreasing the grain size of the specimens. A new alloy, Fe- 25 Cr- 12 Ni- 9 Mn- 4. 5 Al- 2 Si- 0. 5 N is proposed for fabrication and exposure <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting</b> environments <b>to</b> evaluate its suitability for use in industrial applications. It is also recommended that further work be carried out in evaluating the effect of increasing the nitrogen, chromium and manganese contents of the Fe- 18 Cr- 9 Mn- 0. 5 N alloy that performed well in this project. Investigations into the effect of aluminising and nitriding components should also be carried out...|$|R

5000|$|The f/4 non-IS version, {{the least}} {{expensive}} L-series lens Canon makes, is popular among weight-sensitive landscape photographers and hobbyists who want L lens quality without spending thousands of dollars. The f/2.8 versions are popular among event photographers and photojournalists where the lower light capabilities are required; some portrait photographers also prefer this lens for the improved background blur produced by the f/2.8 aperture. The non-IS f/2.8 version was released in 1995 and replaced the EF 80-200mm f/2.8L lens. The IS version lenses use circular eight-bladed diaphragms which maintain a nearly circular aperture when stopped down by up to two stops. The f/2.8 and f/4.0 image-stabilized versions also feature weather sealing (<b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>dust</b> and water) when mated to a weather-sealed camera to such as the Canon EOS 1D-series bodies.

40|$|Metal dusting {{has long}} been a chronic problem for several {{industrial}} sectors. In order to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} aspects of this failure mode, three heat-resistant alloys, KHR 35 C HiSi©, KHR 45 A LC©, and UCX© were exposed to a gas mixture of 80 vol % CO+ 20 vol % H 2 flowing at 100 cm 3 min- 1 at 650, 750, and 850 ºC for 100 h. The alloys were then characterized by visual examination, XRD, and SEM/EDX. In conclusion, KHR 35 C HiSi © suffered localized metal dusting at 650 and 750 ºC and the attack became less aggressive with the temperature increase. The least attack on KHR 35 C HiSi © was however observed after exposure at 850 ºC. The corrosion mode at each temperature was also elucidated. Pitting also occurred on KHR 45 A LC © after exposure at 650 ºC but to a lesser degree compared to KHR 35 C HiSi©. Moreover, a few pits were observed on KHR 45 A LC © exposed at 750 ºC with the least took place at 850 ºC. UCX©, which contained the highest concentrations of chromium and nickel, exhibited the best <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting</b> at the test temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 115 - 120). The {{deposition of}} carbon from a carbon-rich environment onto structural materials is prevalent in petrochemical and chemical {{industries such as}} in the production of syngas, iron reduction plants, petroleum refineries, carbon dioxide cooled nuclear plants, fuel cells using molten salts and hydrocarbons, and the recycle-gas loop equipment of coal-gasification units. The consequence of carbon deposition is a metal related degradation phenomenon known as "Metal dusting". Metal dusting results in rapid material wastage and/or thinning of material, producing hemispherical pits and grooves as the affected material disintegrates into a mixture of carbon and metal particles. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate material factors that cause or contribute <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting.</b> This was achieved by refurbishing the in-built metal <b>dusting</b> rig <b>to</b> carry out experimental tests on a laboratory scale. The objectives of this research were to simulate a metal dusting environment, characterize the resistance of various alloys <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting,</b> and <b>to</b> evaluate the effects of surface treatment and temperature on metal dusting. Metal dusting was induced on a wide variety of nickelbased and iron-based alloys which were capable of forming chromium oxide scales in a flowing CO-HrH 20 atmosphere at 650 °C and 500 °C. Some of the alloys were heat treated at 850 °C for an hour prior to exposure and others were ground to 600 grit SiC. Some degree of metal dusting attack was observed for all alloys tested except for an alloy with high chromium and nickel content. The results indicated that metal dusting is much more aggressive at lower temperatures than at high temperatures. It was also observed that the surface working of the alloys had a very significant effect <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting</b> <b>resistance</b> as well as the amount of scale forming elements additions and the presence of certain carbides forming elements. The preheat treatment seemed not to have a Significant effect on the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> metal <b>dusting...</b>|$|R
