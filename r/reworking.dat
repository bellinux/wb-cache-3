This {{is an issue}} especially for lead-free <b>rework</b> as the temperatures during lead-free BGA/CSP <b>rework</b> {{are likely to be}} higher than reflow soldering, leading to potential component and board temperature related issues. A series of evaluations was conducted on <b>rework</b> equipment from four <b>rework</b> machine equipment suppliers. The BGA/CSP <b>rework</b> machine repeatability and tolerance temperature study used a fixed thermal profile with temperature measurement output on equipment specifically designed for BGA/CSP <b>rework</b> machines. The temperature input was a lead-free <b>rework</b> profile developed by each supplier on a PBGA 544 component on a 135 mil (3. 4 mm) thick test vehicle board.

5|$|Bede also covers Wilfrid's {{life in his}} Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, {{but this}} account is more {{measured}} and restrained than the Vita. In the Historia, Bede used Stephen's Vita as a source, <b>reworking</b> the information and adding new material when possible. Other, more minor, sources for Wilfrid's life include a mention of Wilfrid in one of Bede's letters. A poetical Vita Sancti Wilfrithi by Frithegod written in the 10th century is essentially a rewrite of Stephen's Vita, produced in celebration of the movement of Wilfrid's relics to Canterbury. Wilfrid is also mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, but as the Chronicle was probably a 9th-century compilation, the material on Wilfrid may ultimately have derived either from Stephen's Vita or from Bede. Another, later, source is the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi written by Eadmer, a 12th-century Anglo-Norman writer and monk from Canterbury. This source is highly influenced by the contemporary concerns of its writer, but does attempt to provide some new material besides <b>reworking</b> Bede.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rework</b> in {{construction}} projects {{is referred to}} as the unnecessary effort of redoing a process or activity that was incorrectly implemented in the first instance. In construction projects, <b>rework</b> can result from an array of factors such as errors, omissions, failures, changes, poor communication and poor coordination. <b>Rework</b> could adversely affect the performance and productivity and ultimately the profit margins as well. For example, some previous studies identified that costs of <b>rework</b> could add around 10 % to the total project costs. However, the literature also suggests that <b>rework</b> is mostly unnecessary and avoidable. A pilot study is being conducted in Hong Kong to explore the <b>rework</b> occurrences in the local construction industry. In this paper, some discussions regarding the significance of reducing <b>rework</b> and an overview of <b>rework</b> factors are presented.

40|$|<b>Rework</b> is {{described}} as the transformation of production rejects into re-usable products of the same or lower quality. <b>Rework</b> can be very profitable, especially if disposal costs are high and if materials are expensive and limited in availability. Furthermore, <b>rework</b> can contribute to a ‘green image’. Although {{there is quite a}} lot of literature on logistic planning and control of <b>rework,</b> up to now no {{attention has been paid to}} <b>rework</b> of production rejects that deteriorate while waiting to be <b>reworked.</b> Such situations occur, for example, in the food industry. This paper deals with the above in a production line that is dedicated to a single product and that uses the same facilities for production and <b>rework.</b> Produced lots may be non-defective, reworkable defective or non-reworkable defective. Reworkable defective lots deteriorate over time, which effects the <b>rework</b> time and the <b>rework</b> cost. We consider a disposal strategy and two types of <b>rework</b> strategies. We derive expressions for the average profit per time unit, including costs for production, <b>rework,</b> disposal, procurement of input materials, and storage of reworkable defective lots. Using those expressions, the strategies can be compared numerically, as is illustrated for a few examples...|$|R

40|$|Reducing field <b>rework</b> {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as an effective way of improving construction performance in terms of productivity, cost, schedule, quality, and safety. While existing <b>rework</b> reduction programs and much literature exist concerning this challenge, {{there is a need for}} further analysis and continuous improvement of <b>rework</b> reduction methods. Based on such an analysis, this research develops a generalized conceptual model for a <b>rework</b> reduction program, which is intended to reduce <b>rework</b> by managing a continuous improvement loop with four functional processes: (1) <b>rework</b> tracking and cause classification, (2) evaluation of <b>rework</b> and its causes, (3) corrective action planning, and (4) integration of changes into the total management system. A case study is conducted to examine and verify the functional mechanisms and effectiveness of the generalized model, by investigating a <b>rework</b> reduction program implemented in practice that represents the generalized model, and by analyzing the impact trends on <b>rework</b> in terms of frequency, cost, and labor hours over a considerable time period.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} {{cooperative}} planning and uncertainty affect {{the magnitude of}} <b>rework</b> in concurrent engineering projects with upstream and downstream operations, and explore the impact of such <b>rework</b> on project delays. Using survey data from a sample of 120 business process (BP) redesign and related information technology (IT) development projects in healthcare and telecommunications, our results indicate that upstream (BP) <b>rework</b> and downstream (IT) <b>rework</b> is mediated and mitigated by cooperative planning through upstream/downstream strategy coupling and cross-functional involvement. In addition, uncertainty related {{to a lack of}} firm or industry experience with such projects increases the magnitude of upstream <b>rework</b> but not downstream <b>rework</b> or the amount of cooperative planning. After accounting for project scope, implementation horizon and whether delays are anticipated, we find that project delay is primarily influenced by the magnitude of downstream <b>rework</b> and downstream delay: the magnitude of both upstream and downstream <b>rework</b> significantly increases downstream delay, which significantly increases project delay. However, the magnitude of upstream <b>rework</b> does not directly affect project delay. These results suggest that project delay is under managerial control as cooperative planning is a managerial function that reduces downstream <b>rework,</b> while uncertainty from a lack of experience with the design affecting upstream <b>rework</b> is not directly under managerial control. concurrent design, uncertainty, coordination, cooperative planning, concurrent engineering, project management, delay, process redesign, <b>rework...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry is fast paced {{and on the}} cutting edge of technology, resulting in very short life spans of semiconductor products. In order to stay competitive, manufacturers must be able to quickly adapt to produce new products, and they must achieve a high level of productivity. Two major operational components of semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) that effect productivity are dispatching rules and <b>rework</b> strategies. Although prior research has been conducted independently on these two issues, the hypothesis is that the interrelationship between the dispatching rules and <b>rework</b> strategies has a significant effect on the productivity of the fab. Moreover, the goal is to determine which combination of widely-used dispatching rules and new and existing <b>rework</b> strategies results in the highest level of fab productivity. To test this hypothesis, the significance of <b>rework</b> is evalutated, and a four-factor experiment is conducted to determine the effect of dispatching rules, <b>rework</b> strategies, fab types, and <b>rework</b> levels on key fab performance measures. Five dispatching rules are combined with three previously studied <b>rework</b> strategies and the first bottleneck strategy which is developed in this study. The treatment combinations are compared based on fab performance measures including cycle time, percentage on time, work-in-process, and the XTheoretical value. Simulation models based on actual fab data are constructed to carry out the experiments. The detailed results of the experiment show that combinations of dispatching rules and <b>rework</b> strategies have a significant impact on fab performance measures at each <b>rework</b> level in both fab types. In general, two dispatching rules, <b>rework</b> priority and first-in-first-out, in combination with the first bottleneck <b>rework</b> strategy perform the best. Further analysis concludes that the <b>rework</b> priority dispatching rule and the first bottleneck <b>rework</b> strategy result in the highest level of fab performance and are most robust over alterative fab configurations...|$|R
