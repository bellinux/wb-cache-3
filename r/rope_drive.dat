50|$|As mill engines {{became more}} powerful, from around 1870 {{there was a}} shift from single belt <b>drives</b> to {{multiple}} <b>rope</b> <b>drives.</b> The barring engine needed to turn these <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> over as well (although they were disconnected from the machinery at the remote end) and a simple manual gear was no longer sufficient.

5000|$|In general, as {{with flat}} belts, <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> {{were used for}} {{connections}} from stationary engines to the jack shafts and line shafts of mills, and sometimes from line shafts to driven machinery.

5000|$|Mules and {{man power}} {{had long been}} used {{exclusively}} as the motive power in moving coal from the mines, but this method was expensive and unsatisfactory.

In April, 1906 the first successful gasoline locomotive was built and installed in a large Central Illinois coal mine.|$|E
5000|$|The later engines were large. Arthur Roberts {{reported}} that Hartford Mill was powered by an 1800 hp twin-tandem compound engine by Urmson and Thompson, built in 1907.

The engine was {{reputed to be}} the only twin-tandem that Urmson & Thompson built. It had two 30" [...] diameter HP (high-pressure) cylinders at the rear, and two 60" [...] LP (low-pressure) cylinders in front. There were Corliss valves on all cylinders. The air pumps were driven from each crosshead. There was a Whitehead governor. The engine cost £5400 and the three boilers cost £1900.|$|E

50|$|Flat {{belt drive}} systems became {{popular in the}} UK from the 1870s, with the firms of J & E Wood and W & J Galloway & Sons {{prominent}} in their introduction. Both of these firms manufactured stationary steam engines and the continuing demand for more power and reliability could be met not merely by improved engine technology but also improved methods of transferring power from the engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service.

50|$|The Ellenroad mill was a conventional, {{late nineteenth}} century, cotton mill. During the {{boom of the}} late 1880s, a limited company, the Ellenroad Spinning Co. Ltd, was formed {{to build a new}} mill. They chose the well-respected Oldham architects of Stott and Sons to manage the design and construction. The design was for a {{conservative}} five-storey 40-bay mule spinning mill, with detached engine and boiler houses, driving the line shafts by means of a <b>rope</b> <b>drive.</b> Stotts designed 5 mills in Rochdale, for instance in 1888 they had erected the Moss Mill. For the steam engine they went to the local firm of J & W McNaught and chose a single triple-expansion horizontal engine, which in 1890 produced the greatest efficiency in terms of power per ton of coal. The steam was raised by five Lancashire boilers. These required a 220 ft chimney to provide the draught. Work commenced February 1891, and the first cotton was passing through the card room in May 1892, the final mule was installed and in operation by December 1892. Because this was a Stott mill, {{it is likely that the}} whole of the machinery would have come from one supplier and this would have been Platt Brothers of Oldham or failing that Dobson & Barlow.

A person on the chair or platform is lifted as the chair or platform moves along the rail, old age and goods are to be carried across the stair case. Stair case lift is a type of lift that can be mounted on the stair case without altering civil structure.

40|$|In der Fördertechnik werden in den unterschiedlichsten Anwendungsbereichen Seiltriebe mit Seilscheiben eingesetzt. Große Seilscheiben mit einem Durchmesser von mehr als 2 m werden beispielsweise in Schachtförder- und Seilbahnanlagen, Schiffshebewerken, Großgeräten im Tagebau und im Offshore-Bereich verwendet. Bisherige Berechnungsverfahren zur Ermittlung der Kräfte zwischen Seil und Seilscheibe gehen von einer konstanten längenbezogenen Anpresskraft auf den Seilscheibenkranz aus und vernachlässigen weitere Einflüsse (bspw. Querkräfte aus dem Schrägzug und dynamische Kräfte). Die Biegesteifigkeit des Seils verursacht jedoch beim Auf- und Ablauf des Seils auf die Seilscheibe eine Erhöhung der längenbezogenen Anpresskraft um das bis zu 4 -fache der mittleren Anpresskraft [Häb- 95]. Diese Kraftüberhöhungen am Seilauf- und –ablauf bewirken bei Seilscheiben mit Speichenkonstruktion eine Erhöhung der inneren Beanspruchung (Vergleichsspannung) der Seilscheibe von über 20 % (siehe Kap. 6. 5 dort wird der Zahlenwert berechnet) und müssen deshalb bei der Dimensionierung von Seilscheiben berücksichtigt werden. Bei kleinen Seilablenkwinkeln (< 60 °) tritt eine deutliche Reduzierung der Seillebensdauer auf [Mül- 66]. Dies ist darauf zurückzuführen, dass bei kleinen Ablenkwinkeln die Kraftüberhöhungen am Seilauf- und –ablauf teilweise oder auch vollständig zusammenfallen und nochmals deutlich größere Anpresskräfte zwischen Seil und Seilscheibe entstehen. Da diese Kräfte bisher unbekannt waren, konnten sie bei der Dimensionierung nicht berücksichtigt werden. In der vorliegenden Forschungsarbeit wird ein analytisches Modell dargestellt, in das die bisher nicht berücksichtigten Effekte und Beeinflussungsfaktoren (z. B. Seilmasse und Seilgeschwindigkeit) integriert sind, so dass die Kräfte zwischen Seil und Seilscheibe nun vollständiger beschrieben werden können. Ferner wird ein numerisches Mehrkörpersimulationsmodell beschrieben, mit dem die bis dahin unbekannten Kräfte zwischen Seil und Seilscheibe aufgrund kleiner Ablenkwinkel (die Pressungsspitzen bei Auf- und Ablauf des Seils fallen zusammen), des Schrägzugs und der Dynamik ermittelt werden können. Zur Ermittlung der inneren Beanspruchung von Seilscheiben wird eine Methode auf Basis der Finiten-Elemente-Berechnung entwickelt und die Spannungsverläufe beispielsweise in den Speichen der Seilscheibe während der Rotation dargestellt. Zur Validierung des entwickelten Berechnungsverfahrens und der numerischen Modelle werden an einer in der Praxis eingesetzten Seilscheibe einer Seilbahnanlage umfangreiche Messreihen zur Bestimmung der Verformungen und Spannungen in der Seilscheibe durchgeführt. Abschließend wird eine Methode zur sicheren festigkeitstechnischen Dimensionierung großer Seilscheiben entwickelt. Diese Methode basiert auf den gewonnenen Erkenntnissen der Anpresskräfte zwischen Seil und Seilscheibe, aus denen allgemeingültige Belastungsannahmen abgeleitet werden. Since {{many decades}} big sheaves (with diameters bigger than 2 meters) {{are used in}} lots of {{different}} applications in mechanical handling, for example in hoisting plants, ropeways, ship lifts, giant equipment in strip mining and the offshore area. However {{there is a lack}} of knowledge of the load situation (pressure between rope and sheave) of these sheaves. So the stress situation (deformations and the mechanical stresses) of the sheaves are also unknown. Therefore the sheaves are either highly overdesigned or in the worst case not enough dimensioned and this results in breakdown of the sheave. Until now for strength calculation and dimensioning of sheaves it was assumed that the line contact pressure (normal force) between rope and sheave is constant [Ose- 82]. But when the rope enters onto or runs off the sheave the line contact pressure increases because of the bending stiffness of the rope [Häb- 95]. These peaks can reach up to 4 times of the average line contact pressure which depends on rope construction, rope force and ratio of diameters between rope and sheave. Furthermore there are more influencing factors unconsidered as for example lateral forces because of diagonal pull or dynamic forces because of start-up processes and rundowns of conveyor systems. To come to new elementary conclusions for dimensioning of big sheaves, both an analytic model for calculation of contact forces between rope and sheave was developed and extensive theoretical and experimental series were realized to get the load and stress situation of big sheaves in this research study. Consequently the results of this research study are a general basic for a safety dimensioning of big sheaves. Because of essential enormous processing power it is currently not possible to dynamically simulate a completely detailed steal wire rope with all wires and strands by the finite-element-method when the rope runs over the sheave. So a practical numerical analogous model based on a parameter assisted multi-body simulation model for the simulation of the dynamic run of a rope over a sheave was developed. This multi-body simulation model enables to calculate the contact forces between rope and sheave. By small fleet angles (smaller then 60 °) the peaks of the line contact pressure go partially or completely together when the rope enters onto and runs of the sheave and this results in a noticeable higher contact force, which was unknown so far. With the developed numerical model for the first time it is possible to calculate these forces qualitatively and quantitatively. Within the analysed rope constructions there are maximum forces of 6 times of the constant (so far considered for the dimensioning of sheaves) part of the line contact pressure by small fleet angles. Therefore a calculation of the line contact pressure at small fleet angles by the given calculation method is no more acceptable. At the start-up process or rundown of conveyor systems the rope force changes due to acceleration forces. This means that the contact forces between rope and sheave are variable and even higher during acceleration. For the first time these contact forces can be calculated by the help of the developed numerical model for a complete dynamic drive of the conveyor system with acceleration phase, phase with constant velocity and deceleration phase. The results show that the forces between rope and sheave are principally straight proportional to the acceleration. Furthermore it is possible to analyse the effects of vibrations in longitudinal direction of the rope on the contact forces, because of the lurch at the acceleration. Further-more this results in temporary higher contact forces. If there is diagonal pull between rope and sheave, which often cannot be avoided in wire <b>rope</b> <b>drive</b> systems, there are the same effects as if the rope entered onto or ran off the sheave. So because of the bending resistance of the rope there are higher contact forces between rope and sheave especially cross to the internal groove sidewall of the sheave, than up to now it could be calculated with an extremely simplified analytic model. With the developed numerical model it is possible to calculate the amplitude and the run of the contact force for the first time. The amplitude of the contact force is mainly influenced by the diagonal pull angle and the rope force. Furthermore the geometry especially the angle of the internal groove sidewall has also an effect on the contact forces because of the diagonal pull. On the basic of the analytic calculation method and the numerical model of the run of a rope over a sheave, there were general loads assumed for the safety dimensioning of big rope sheaves developed...|$|E
