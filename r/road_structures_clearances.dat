40|$|With the {{occurrence}} of disasters caused by natural hazards rising in frequency and intensity, the importance of conducting research {{on the effect of}} disasters on major infrastructure becomes evident. Road infrastructure such as bridges, culverts and flood-ways play an important role before, during and after a disaster since providing access to affected areas is a vital factor influencing the evacuation, rescue, recovery and also reconstruction activities. Consequence assessment of disasters on <b>road</b> <b>structures</b> provides valuable information for decision makers to measure the potential risk on structures and to identify and implement appropriate strategies and programs to sustain the infrastructure. Assessment of social, environmental and economic consequences of failure of <b>road</b> <b>structures</b> provides necessary data to design <b>road</b> <b>structures</b> that are not only more resilient to natural hazards, but also sustainable in the long run. This paper reviews the current literature which focuses on measuring sustainability (i. e. social, environmental and economic) impacts of <b>road</b> <b>structure</b> failure due to disasters.

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>structures</b> are {{important}} to the survival of nations. As the cost for the rehabilitation and maintenance of highways soars, civil engineers and administrators face the ever present difficulty of meeting current resurfacing and rehabilitation needs. The deterioration of <b>road</b> <b>structures</b> under growing traffic weight and volume is occurring faster than agencies envisaged coupled with increasingly scarce and expensive new materials required.

40|$|The DER-rating {{method has}} been adopted as the {{national}} standard for the rating of <b>road</b> <b>structures.</b> This method is defects-based and involves the rating of defects on the various inspections items of <b>road</b> <b>structures</b> in terms of degree (D), extent (E) and relevancy (R) rating. The DER-rating method has {{been included in the}} Draft TMH 19 Manual for the Visual Assessment of <b>Road</b> <b>Structures.</b> The D, E, and R ratings are used to calculate condition indices for <b>road</b> <b>structures.</b> The method used is a deduct-points approach, similar to what is recommended in the Draft TMH 22 Road Asset Management Systems Manual for calculating different condition and need indices for road pavements. This paper describes the procedure to arrive at a Priority Condition Index (PCI) that identifies those structures with critical defects that should receive urgent attention, using the D, E and R ratings allocated to defects during the visual assessment of the <b>structure.</b> For <b>road</b> <b>structures,</b> defects are identified per inspection sub-item and the worst defect on a sub-item is rated, which then becomes the rating for that inspection sub-item. The sub-item DER ratings are used as input to calculate deduct points for the sub-item. These sub-item deduct points are then used as input to calculate a PCI for the sub-item. The worst sub-item PCI value determines the condition index for an inspection item. Finally, the condition indices of the inspection items are used to calculate the PCI for the whole structure. The PCI value ranges from 0 (worst condition) to 100 (best condition). The structure?s PCI determines what condition category the structure falls in. Five condition categories, namely ?Critical?; ?Poor?, ?Fair?, ?Good?; or ?Very Good?, are used.

40|$|The coupled {{transport}} of water and heat, involving freezing and thawing, in the <b>road</b> <b>structure</b> and its immediate environment {{is important to consider}} for optimal design and maintenance of roads and when assessing solute transport, of e. g. de-icing salt, from roads. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop mechanistic models, and measurement techniques, suitable to describe and understand water flow and heat flux in <b>road</b> <b>structures</b> exposed to a cold climate. Freezing and thawing was accounted for by implementing new routines in two numerical models (HYDRUS 1 D/ 2 D). The sensitivity of the model output to changes in parameter values and operational hydrological data was investigated by uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. The effect of rainfall event characteristics and asphalt fractures on the subsurface flow pattern was investigated by scenario modelling. The performance of water content reflectometers (WCR), measuring water content, was evaluated using measurements in two <b>road</b> <b>structure</b> materials. A numerical model was used to simulate WCR sensor response. The freezing/thawing routines were stable and provided results in agreement with laboratory measurements. Frost depth, thawing period, and freezing-induced water redistribution in a model road was greatly affected by groundwater level and type of subgrade. The simulated subsurface flow patterns corresponded well with published field observations. A new method was successful in enabling the application of time domain reflectometer (TDR) calibration equations to WCR output. The observed distortion in sampling volume for one of the road materials could be explained by the WCR sensor numerical model. Soil physical, hydrological, and hydraulic modules proved successful in simulating the coupled {{transport of}} water and heat in and on the <b>road</b> <b>structure.</b> It was demonstrated in this thesis that numerical models can improve the interpretation and explanation of measurements.
