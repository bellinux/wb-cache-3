5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy <b>resins,</b> where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant <b>resins,</b> indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2).

40|$|The MIEX® 1 <b>Resin</b> {{process was}} {{developed}} in Australia {{for the removal of}} natural organic material in water treatment. This novel, truly continuous ion exchange process, is based on the MIEX ® <b>resin</b> – a micro size, macroporous, strong base, magnetic ion exchange <b>resin.</b> The <b>resin</b> was specially developed for this application and optimised for reversible removal of negatively charged organic ions. The MIEX ® <b>resin</b> process uses mixed tanks for contacting <b>resin</b> with water. A very small amount of <b>resin</b> (5 - 10 mL settled <b>resin</b> per litre water) is used to exchange organics from water during 15 - 30 min detention time in a continuous, stirred tank reactor. After that, the <b>resin</b> is separated and treated water removed from the process for further treatment in a downstream settling unit. The gravity settling based <b>resin</b> separation is very efficient because of “magnetically ” enhanced agglomeration of individual <b>resin</b> beads, a process that yields <b>resin</b> agglomerates capable of settling against high water rise rate in the settler. Settled <b>resin</b> accumulates on the settler bottom and is pumped back to the contactor as concentrated slurry. Small amount of recycled <b>resin</b> is continuously removed for regeneration and replaced with regenerated <b>resin.</b> This general concept of the MIEX ® <b>resin</b> process is explained in detail in this paper and supported with results from a number of evaluation trials conducted in Australia...|$|R

40|$|Aim of the study: In {{this work}} {{potential}} <b>resin</b> yield {{in a region}} of high forest ability where maritime pine is the main species was estimated {{in order to understand}} the viability of promoting <b>resin</b> exploitation. Area of study: This study was conducted in Castro Daire County in central region of Portugal. Material and methods: To quantify the <b>resin</b> yield of trees tapped for the first time two plots were installed in a maritime pine stand with average tree age 65 years. Before the beginning of the <b>resin</b> tapping, dendrometric tree variables were measured. Also, in a neighbouring stand, 25 trees were selected to check the relation between tree dbh and <b>resin</b> yield. Gum <b>resin</b> from every tree was weighted during the season. Estimates of potential <b>resin</b> yield in Castro Daire County were made based on data from National Forest Inventory plots, <b>resin</b> tapping legislation and <b>resin</b> yield values obtained in the field. Two scenarios were considered: high and low <b>resin</b> yield. To understand the intentions of forest owners towards restarting <b>resin</b> tapping activity 16 maritime pine forest owners were interviewed.

In contrast, workers did not increase <b>resin</b> collection in response to exposure to B. bassiana, nor did they place <b>resin</b> closer to contaminated brood or contaminated areas of the nest.
