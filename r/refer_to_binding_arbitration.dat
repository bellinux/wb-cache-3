Critics alleged that CherryOS contained code grafted from PearPC, which would have been a violation of the GNU General Public License. In March 2011, Code Rebel's competitor Aqua Connect, Inc. filed suit against Code Rebel claiming misappropriation of trade secrets. The Cherry OS controversy was used by Aqua Connect's lawyers in an attempt to discredit Code Rebel and Kane. After partial dismissal, first amendment, and second dismissal, the case was <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>binding</b> <b>arbitration</b> by agreement of the parties. Code Rebel prevailed in the arbitration, and on August 19, 2014, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered judgment in favor of Code Rebel on all claims, stating “Aqua Connect has failed to establish any act of reverse engineering by Code Rebel or any other illegal act.” ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the increasing use of}} contracts of adhesion in which companies require consumers, employees, franchisees and other 2 ̆ 2 little guys 2 ̆ 2 to submit disputes with the company <b>to</b> <b>binding</b> <b>arbitration.</b> The article argues that the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s current preference for such agreements is not statutorily well-founded. Specifically, it contends that the Federal Arbitration Act was not intended to make such agreements binding on unknowing consumers or employees. Turning next to policy analysis, the article asserts that the Supreme Court has erred in expressing a preference for <b>binding</b> <b>arbitration</b> in cases where such arbitration was not knowingly and voluntarily accepted by both parties. In particular, it argues that <b>binding</b> <b>arbitration</b> is not necessarily better and cheaper for all parties than litigation. Rather, a company can use a <b>binding</b> <b>arbitration</b> clause <b>to</b> secure significant strategic advantages over less knowledgeable parties. The article further argues that by using preemption principles to preclude states from protecting their own citizens from unfair <b>binding</b> <b>arbitration</b> Congress and the Supreme Court have trammeled important federalism interests...|$|R
40|$|A {{major issue}} in the ongoing Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) {{negotiations}} is investor-state dispute resolution {{as it relates to}} foreign investments.
