5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that G-spot and clitoral orgasms are of the same origin. Masters and Johnson {{were the first to}} determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's sexual <b>response</b> <b>cycle</b> to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual <b>response</b> <b>cycle,</b> which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E
25|$|In menopausal women, sexual {{functioning}} can impact several {{dimensions of}} a woman’s life, including her physical, psychological, and mental well-being. During {{the onset of}} menopause, sexuality can be a critical issue in determining whether one begins to experience changes in their sexual <b>response</b> <b>cycle.</b> Both age— and menopause-related events can affect the integrity of a woman’s biological systems involved in the sexual <b>response</b> <b>cycle,</b> which include hormone environment, neuro-muscular substrates, and vascular supplies. Therefore, it can be appropriate {{to make use of}} HRT, especially in women with low or declining quality of life due to sexual difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} is {{the inability}} to react emotionally or physically to sexual stimulation in a way projected of the average healthy person; it can affect different stages in the sexual <b>response</b> <b>cycles,</b> which are desire, excitement and orgasm.

25|$|Shortly after Masters and Johnson {{published}} their book, several scholars criticized {{their model}} of the human sexual <b>response</b> <b>cycle.</b> For example, Helen Singer Kaplan argued that Masters and Johnson only evaluated sexual response from a physiological perspective, and that psychological, emotional, and cognitive factors {{need to be taken}} into consideration. As a result, she proposed her {{model of the}} sexual <b>response</b> <b>cycle</b> which includes three phases: desire, excitement, and orgasm. She argues that these three phases are interconnected, yet they have different neurophysiological mechanisms. Similarly, Paul Robinson argued that the excitement and plateau phases are the same; he criticizes Masters and Johnson's work for not clearly distinguishing when the excitement phase ends, and when the plateau phase begins.|$|E

25|$|A {{thorough}} {{sexual history}} {{and assessment of}} general health and other sexual problems (if any) are very important. Assessing performance anxiety, guilt, stress and worry are integral to the optimal management of sexual dysfunction.

25|$|Masters and Johnson {{were some}} of the first {{researchers}} to study the sexual <b>response</b> <b>cycle</b> in the early 1960s, based on the observation of 382 women and 312 men. They described a cycle that begins with excitement as blood rushes into the genitals, then reaches a plateau during which they are fully aroused, which leads to orgasm, and finally resolution, in which the blood leaves the genitals.|$|E
25|$|Orgasm is the {{conclusion}} of the plateau phase of the sexual <b>response</b> <b>cycle</b> and is experienced by both males and females. It is accompanied by quick cycles of muscle contraction in the lower pelvic muscles, which surround both the anus and the primary sexual organs. Women also experience uterine and vaginal contractions. Orgasms are often associated with other involuntary actions, including vocalizations and muscular spasms {{in other areas of the}} body, and a generally euphoric sensation. Heart rate is increased even further.|$|E

This work is equivalent to considering the effects of northward and southward turnings of the interplanetary magnetic field for various periods of time. It is found that relatively extended episodes (not less than 2 hours) of turned-on input with shorter (about 1 hour) periods of turned-off input lead to model behavior much like the continuously driven case. Going to short input intervals with longer periods of zero input leads to highly irregular and dramatically fluctuating episodes of magnetotail unloading. These results give an insight into the diversity of apparent magnetospheric responses during relatively isolated substorm conditions.

25|$|In a {{clinical}} context, orgasm is usually defined strictly by the muscular contractions involved during sexual activity, {{along with the}} characteristic patterns of change in heart rate, blood pressure, and often respiration rate and depth. This is categorized as the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual tension during the sexual <b>response</b> <b>cycle,</b> resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region. However, definitions of orgasm vary and there is sentiment that consensus on how to consistently classify it is absent. At least twenty-six definitions of orgasm were listed in the journal Clinical Psychology Review.|$|E
25|$|The human sexual <b>response</b> <b>cycle</b> set the {{foundation}} for studying and categorizing sexual dysfunctions in men and women. There are four main categories of sexual dysfunctions: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasm disorders, and sexual pain disorders. They are still categorized as such in the DSM-IV-TR. Recent research however, suggests that the current model of sexual response needs to be revised to better treat these dysfunctions. One reason {{is that there is}} considerable overlap between sexual dysfunctions in women. One study found that in patients with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), 41% of women had at least one other sexual dysfunction and 18% had diagnoses in all 3 categories (that is, in desire, arousal, and orgasm disorders).|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship of serum FSH and LH levels at the commencement of stimulation to ovarian follicular development in women undergoing pituitary down-regulation and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with gonadotropins in IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. Design: Retrospective analysis. Setting: An lVF program in a tertiary medical center. Patient(s) : A total of 245 women proven to be pituitary down-regulated by their serum E- 2 levels. Intervention(s) : Patients treated with a GnRH agonist and FSH and hMG underwent assisted reproductive technique (ART). Main Outcome Measure(s) : Mature oocyte yield, pregnancy rate (PR), and live birth rate. Result(s) : The serum FSH levels and the FSH-to-LH ratio at the commencement of gonadotropin stimulation were inversely correlated to the number of mature oocytes (r = - 0. 193 and r = - 0. 224, respectively). When assessed with receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, there was statistically significant ability for the FSH/LH ratio to differentiate between the '' poor <b>response</b> '' <b>cycles</b> (with mature oocyte yield = 3 produced less mature oocytes (8. 25 vs. 11. 74), lower peak E- 2 levels (1, 9753 pg/mL vs. 3, 324. 8 pg/mL), and higher percentage of poor ovarian <b>response</b> <b>cycles</b> (32. 5 % vs. 14. 3 %).

40|$|A {{major cause}} of {{volatility}} in American real estate market cycles is the lag between demand growth and supply <b>response.</b> <b>Cycles</b> can be separated into four distinct phases based upon the rates of change in both supply and demand. Data of demand, supply, vacancy and gross asking rates {{were used to determine}} rental growth from 54 office markets and 54 industrial markets. The data supports the theory that office and industrial rental growth rates will be above inflation when markets have occupancy levels above their long term occupancy average (LTOA) and below inflation when markets have occupancy levels below their LTOA. In the first decade in the new millennium most economists predict moderate but stable demand growth. The supply of space will be more restricted than in previous cycles. This real estate cycle is driven by declining demand, not oversupply. High profits may no longer become available as real estate markets become more efficient. ...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{issue is}} that, among women, {{there is a}} {{discrepancy}} between desire and arousal. After Cynthia Graham critically evaluated female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), she found that women reported that, contrary to Masters and Johnson's model, sexual arousal sometimes preceded sexual desire; at other times, desire presented before arousal. Because of the high comorbidity rates between HSDD and FSAD, {{she would like to}} merge them to make the category [...] "Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder." [...] Hartmann and colleagues summarize their views of the current model of the sexual <b>response</b> <b>cycle</b> and conclude that [...] "by simply expanding and continuing DSM-IV criteria and the traditional <b>response</b> <b>cycle</b> classification systems, it is impossible to come to diagnostic categories and subtypes that adequately reflect real-life female sexual problems".|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of 28 days of dietary carbohydrate (CHO) supplementation on plasma cytokine <b>responses</b> to <b>cycle</b> ergometry. Sixteen highly trained male cyclists and triathletes (age: 30. 6 ± 5. 6 y; VO₂max: 64. 8 ± 4. 7 mL. kg⁻¹. min⁻¹; mean±SD) participated in the study. One group (n= 8) consumed a higher-CHO (8. 5 ± 1. 7 g. kg⁻¹ body mass. day⁻¹) diet for 28 days; a second group (n= 8) consumed a moderate-CHO diet (5. 3 ± 0. 4 g. kg⁻¹. day⁻¹). Total daily energy intakes were similar between the two groups. Cytokine <b>responses</b> to <b>cycle</b> ergometry were assessed prior to and again following the dietary intervention period. The cycle ergometry protocol involved 100 min steady state cycling at 70 % VO₂max followed by a time trial of ~ 30 min. Athletes were provided with 15 mL. kg⁻¹. h⁻¹ of water during each trial. Blood samples were collected pre-, immediately post- and 1 h post-exercise for determination of plasma glucose and pro-inflammatory (IL- 6, IL- 8) and anti-inflammatory (IL- 10, IL- 1 ra) cytokine concentrations. Cytokine <b>responses</b> to <b>cycle</b> ergometry were not substantially altered following the 28 -day higher-CHO diet. In contrast, following the 28 -day moderate-CHO diet, there were ~ 30 - 50 % reductions (p= 0. 08 - 0. 11) in anti-inflammatory cytokine responses post-exercise. These findings suggest that increased dietary CHO content alone does not effectively attenuate the pro-inflammatory cytokine response to exercise, however, {{there may be a}} small reduction in the anti-inflammatory cytokine response...|$|R
