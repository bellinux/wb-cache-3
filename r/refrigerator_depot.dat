40|$|The regularities of {{influencing}} technological {{factors on}} the cracking process have been studied, the scientific principles {{in which the}} ideas about influence of the technological damage ability sources on the crack formation mechanism have been developed have been studied, the conditions at which the increase of the cracking resistance is achieved {{at the expense of}} improving structural state of the connection provided with the welding combination by melting and diffusion welding have been determined. The principial-new welding procedures at which the improvement in properties of the brand mark connections is achieved {{at the expense of the}} heat action of the arc on the metal structure of the solid-phase welding have been developed that permitted to create the combined connections the improvement of the quality in which is provided at sufficient decrease of the heat contribution, residual stresses, porosity etc. The results are used on the Klaipeda <b>Refrigerator</b> <b>Depot</b> of Fishing Fleet, Riga Electromechanical Works and other enterprises including design offices and works of the aviation industry.
