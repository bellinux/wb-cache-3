40|$|Various {{forms of}} threats, {{technological}} accidents, {{especially in the}} chemical industry and military complexes which cause major damages to humans, assets and environment, draw attention to development of new technological means to eliminate danger without the risk for human life. This determines the equipment logistic for the protection and rescue system. In line with this, the article presents {{the development of a}} robotized system for detection of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats (CBRN), and for detection and neutralization of improvised explosive devices (CIED). In addition, a prototype model of a robotic vehicle is constructed. Reconnaissance, terrain and object mapping are of great importance so that the operators and technicians have at their disposal an option of multiple analysis of a problem. The basic feature of using a robotized machine is the replacement of EOD and CBRN technicians in various life-threatening situations. Citizens 2 ̆ 7 trust is of greatest and crucial importance for providing safety in such extraordinary situations. In order to meet the strict tactical and technical requirements, the <b>robotised</b> <b>system</b> comprises the stealth platform, working tools, a control console, a manipulator arm for complex actions, a CBRN detector, an additional EOD robot for terrain scouting and sample taking, an unmanned reconnaissance aircraft and a mobile command center. The prototype model of a robotic vehicle shows that the project is both technically and economically feasible {{on the basis of a}} tracked machine with battery propulsion, the Ultra Low Profile dozer. Existing resources and experience in development of specialized machines are significant for the development of a <b>robotised</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{precision}} agriculture, which {{comprises the}} agriculture as {{an application of}} mecha-tronics, enhances a new methodology (that aims at a new agricultural system) {{that could be the}} key to many current problems. Precision agriculture components: teledetection and GPS, simulation models, support systems for decision and GIS, automatisation, <b>robotised</b> <b>system,</b> agricultural machines make possible to develop the Agricultural Mechatronics. In the paper we present the opportunities that have favored the development of precision agriculture and the results obtained by the authors from the measurements of an important parameter of the soil: the conductivity. Dynamic measurements and GPS system, assure the simultaneous acquisition of the soil parameters. Specific data base can be obtained leading to high productivity and reduced chemical analysis cost.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the operation and}} control software of a developed automatic crane {{for use in the}} assembly of modular buildings elements in the construction site. The automatic system was developed using a commercial crane, which was modified by adding the adequate sensors, servomotors and an advanced control <b>system.</b> The new <b>robotised</b> crane <b>system</b> is meant to work in an automatic or semi-automatic manner to achieve the assembly of modules following the sequence established during the design process. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} microfluidic platform called GRAVI ™ will {{be presented}} here as a novel <b>robotised</b> bench-top <b>system</b> for fast and automated ELISA analysis in low volumes. By dramatically reducing time-to-result (total assay time of < 10 min, including chip regeneration) 1, 2 and significantly decreasing sample/reagent consumption and cost, this microfluidics-based biosensor system allows performing multi-menu immunoassays with simplified robotics and laboratory infrastructure. Coupled to a sample preparation robot, the GRAVI ™ system can handle samples and reagents from conventional plates or tubes, and automatically pipettes these into a tilted linear microchannel array (GRAVI™-Chip) arranged in SBS compatible format. The sample-, washing-, conjugate- and substrate-solutions are dispensed successively in the upper reservoirs of the micro-channels, and flow by gravity-induced pressure towards the bottom waste outlets 3 The affinity capture is ensured either by antibodies immobilised on the micro-channel walls, or by functionalised magnetic beads trapped with a programmable magnet addressing each microchannel individually, as illustrated in Figure 1. Detection is performed in parallel by electrochemical means 4, and the chips are regenerated after each assay, either with an affinity elution buffer or by releasing the magnetic beads. Some degree of multiplexing (4 -Plex) is also possible with the GRAVI™-Chips, providing that the secondary antibodies are labelled with different enzymes (ALP, b-Galactosidase, HRP and Glucose oxidase).

40|$|In this work, a {{prototype}} robotic system is proposed to avoid direct exposure of responders and permit remote detection of CBRN agents. The system, is {{named by the}} acronym RoSyDCBRN (<b>Robotised</b> <b>System</b> to Detect CBRN agents), basically consists of two functional areas which interact and communicate with each other; a mobile system (robot) and a remote station. Suitable first alarm, identification, and identification and first alarm CBRN detectors are chosen for the robot and remote station. In addition, suitable meteorological detectors are chosen to obtain the environmental parameters {{that are necessary to}} launch simulation with the predictive software (such as NBC-Analysis) in order to provide safe routes for the responders and the population. The conceptual work scheme of the robot is divided into three phases; Phase 1 : Launch of the robot; Phase 2 : Detection and data transmission; Phase 3 : Robot returns and sample analysis in the laboratory. On the whole, the prototype integrates into a single architecture all the components that at present, in the case of CBRN events, operate separately or merged partially, but not totally cooperating {{with a high degree of}} automation as in the proposed system...|$|E
