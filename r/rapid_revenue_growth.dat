5000|$|Despite its {{rapid growth}} and {{significant}} {{position in the}} commercial Internet services market, the company was never profitable. [...] A management team of inexperienced, young people {{was replaced by a}} more seasoned team of professional managers from companies like MCI, but its acquisition spree was too overwhelming for them to manage, in addition to the executives with a voice based telecom background (circuit-switched) did not completely understand the nuances of a packet switched network. It was a popular stock with analysts during most of the dot-com boom because of its <b>rapid</b> <b>revenue</b> <b>growth</b> and aggressive expansion plans, but by 2000, PSINet was beginning to struggle. The company lost more than $5 billion in 2000 despite having close to doubled annual revenues to $995 million. Some analysts point to the Metamor acquisition as the turning point for the company, burdening it with the demands of integrating business operations while it was already struggling with significant debt from its earlier acquisitions, and facing a general slowdown in the computer services industry. However, the company had missed earnings estimates the year before, and was said to be looking to sell parts of its operation in late 1999.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a study of the {{characteristics}} and direct employment impact of high-growth firms operating in Georgia. The longitudinal data used in this study are from the National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) database. Using a standard definition of high employment growth to classify firms, we track the direct employment contribution of high-growth firms in the state from 1989 to 2009. We find that {{only a small fraction of}} firms satisfied the high-growth employment criteria in any year, but these rapidly growing firms made a disproportionately large contribution to overall job creation in the state. We discover that, as has been found for the United States as a whole, the number of high-growth firms and their average job creation has declined during last decade. We also find that the incidence of high growth and the resulting job creation differ significantly according to size, age, industry, type of organizational structure, and ownership as well as location. A separate analysis focusing on firms with <b>rapid</b> sales <b>revenue</b> <b>growth</b> reveals that firms with fast-growing revenue- are not necessarily firms with fast-growing employment...|$|R
40|$|Across the nation, large budget gaps {{are forcing}} state governments to make tough policy choices. While {{some states are}} trying to control spending, others are turning to tax {{increases}} to balance their budgets. Some state {{officials are trying to}} pass the buck for their poor fiscal management by pleading for a bailout from Washington. But a bailout would encourage states to continue overspending, which {{is the source of the}} current fiscal mess. The states' mistake was to allow <b>rapid</b> tax <b>revenue</b> <b>growth</b> during the 1990 s to fuel an unsustainable expansion in spending. Between fiscal years 1990 and 2001, state tax revenue grew 86 percent [...] more than the 55 percent of inflation plus population growth. If states had limited spending growth to that benchmark, budgets would have been $ 93 billion smaller by FY 01 [...] representing savings roughly twice the size of today's state budget gaps. If <b>revenue</b> <b>growth</b> higher than the benchmark had been given back to taxpayers in permanent tax cuts and annual rebates, rebates could have been temporarily suspended during FY 02 and FY 03 to provide a cushion with which to balance state budgets. Current budget gaps provide policymakers an opportunity to weed out the budget excesses built up during the past decade. Yet overall state spending continues to grow. After soaring 8. 0 percent in FY 01, state general fund spending has not been cut in FY 02 or FY 03 even as large budget gaps have appeared. States should impose tax and spending growth caps to prevent budgets from growing too quickly during the next boom. <b>Revenue</b> <b>growth</b> above a benchmark would be given back in tax cuts and tax rebates. That would prevent spending from increasing too quickly and provide the option of suspending rebates during slowdowns to close budget gaps without the damage caused by tax rate increases...|$|R
30|$|Under current conditions, the Chinese {{government}} could bear {{a tax cut}} of more than 500 billion yuan in 1  year. In 2011, total tax revenue was 8972.031 billion yuan, an increase of 1650.952 billion over the previous year, for a YoY growth rate of 22.6  %. Such <b>rapid</b> tax <b>revenue</b> <b>growth</b> rates are not common. In 2010, nationwide total tax revenue was 7320.2 billion yuan, a YoY increase of 23  %. Since 1998, China’s tax revenues have grown rapidly. From 2004 to 2011, tax <b>revenue</b> <b>growth</b> rates have exceeded GDP annual growth rates at 10.6, 8.7, 7, 20.7, 9.2, 0.6, 12.7, and 13.4  %, respectively. The only slow growth year was 2009, {{as a result of}} the international financial crisis. In previous years, tax revenues grew at the same rate as GDP. If tax revenues were able to balance the budget, there would be no problem establishing budgets, and tax cuts could be equivalent to the amount of tax revenues exceeding GDP. If the economy grew at a normal speed, the ceiling of tax cuts would be 10  % of tax revenues. In 2012, target tax revenue would be 9828.9 billion, 9  % higher than the previous year. The 2012 target GDP growth rate was 7.5  %. Based on these numbers, the ceiling of tax cuts would be 8.5  %. Following this logic, the tax cut ceiling would be 830 billion in 2012. If one takes decreasing tax revenues into consideration, the floor of tax cuts would be around 500 billion, based on conservative estimation and a tax cut scale of 5  %.|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} essay, {{we examine the}} effect of pre-IPO growth rates on the {{valuation}} and long-run performance of new issues. IPOs with <b>rapid</b> pre-IPO <b>revenue</b> <b>growth</b> obtain significantly higher offer value and secondary market valuation but have relatively poor long-term stock returns. There is no evidence that performance differentials are due to risk premia. Indeed the high-growth firms are riskier according to traditional measures. Finally, we show that analysts’ forecasts are upwardly biased for all firms, and the magnitude of these biases is greatest for firms with rapid pre-IPO growth. Overall these results are consistent with the behavioral model suggested by Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny (1994) and La Porta (1996). In the second essay, we examine pre-IPO R 2 ̆ 6 D investment as a signal for IPO issuer quality. We find that firms with high levels of pre-IPO R 2 ̆ 6 D investment obtain significantly higher valuations at the IPO and experience superior post-issue operating performance. Pre-IPO R 2 ̆ 6 D investment is positively related to the probability and size of subsequent seasoned offerings. Consistent with the usage of R 2 ̆ 6 D as a signal – in particular, the overuse of it {{at the time of the}} IPO – there is a rapid reversal in the amount of post-IPO R 2 ̆ 6 D.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{potential}} impact of oil revenues on the economy of Sudan and the challenges facing the Government in policy making and allocation of oil revenues for long-run development and diversification of the production and export structure of the economy.
