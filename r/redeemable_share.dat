50|$|From June 1988 (see next section), {{the company}} began to use <b>redeemable</b> {{preference}} <b>shares</b> to raise capital. These securities look like equity and were classified as such on the company's balance sheet but since {{a failure of the}} company's share price to rise above a pre-determined threshold at a nominated forward date would enable the preference holders to put their stock back to the company, these instruments were in truth more like interest-paying debt.|$|R

50|$|The term fixed {{maturity}} is applicable to {{any form of}} financial instrument under which the loan is due to be repaid on a fixed date. This includes fixed interest and variable rate loans or debt instruments, whatever they are called, and also other forms of security such as <b>redeemable</b> preference <b>shares,</b> provided their terms of issue specify a date. It is similar in meaning to 'redemption date'. However some such instruments may have no {{fixed maturity}} date. Loans with no maturity date continue indefinitely (unless repayment is agreed between the borrower and the lenders at some point) and may be known as 'perpetual stocks'. Some instruments {{have a range of}} possible maturity dates, and such stocks can usually be repaid at any time within that range, as chosen by the borrower.|$|R
5000|$|Alternately, {{a capital}} note is {{a bond with}} a very long {{maturity}} horizon, reaching several decades (sometimes as much as 50 or 100 years). Unlike equity securities, these capital notes do mature at some point; therefore, they form part of the company's liabilities and not part of equity. However, since their maturity is {{so far in the}} future, they are treated as equity for practical purposes; the company keeps the money raised through them inside its balance sheet for a very long time. Banks and other financial institutions issue these bonds to satisfy regulatory demands regarding capital requirements, specifically under the Basel Accords. In the Basel [...] "tiers" [...] system, capital notes are treated as close to equity, as both reinforce the bank's [...] "capital". Additionally, bank capital notes are usually not collateralized and are contractually subordinated, forming a junior class of debt. Similar terms might be found in <b>redeemable</b> preferred <b>shares.</b>|$|R

2500|$|While {{corporate}} governance primarily concerns the general relative {{rights and duties}} of shareholders, employees and directors in terms of administration and accountability, corporate finance concerns how the monetary or capital stake of shareholders and creditors are mediated, given {{the risk that the}} business may fail and become insolvent. Companies can fund their operations either through debt (i.e. loans) or equity (i.e. shares). In return for loans, typically from a bank, companies will often be required by contract to give their creditors a security interest over the company's assets, so that in the event of insolvency, the creditor may take the secured asset. The Insolvency Act 1986 limits powerful creditors ability to sweep up all company assets as security, particularly through a floating charge, in favour of vulnerable creditors, such as employees or consumers. If money is raised by offering shares, the shareholders' relations are determined as a group by the provisions under the constitution. The law requires disclosure of all material facts in promotions, and prospectuses. Company constitutions typically require that existing shareholders have a pre-emption right, to buy newly issued shares before outside shareholders and thus avoid their stake and control becoming diluted. Actual rights, however, are determined by ordinary principles of construction of the company constitution. A host of rules exist to ensure that the company's capital (i.e. the amount that shareholders paid in when they bought their shares) is maintained for the benefit of creditors. Money is typically distributed to shareholders through dividends as the reward for investment. These should only come out of profits, or surpluses beyond the capital account. If companies pay out money to shareholders which in effect is a dividend [...] "disguised" [...] as something else, directors will be liable for repayment. Companies may, however, reduce their capital to a lower figure if directors of private companies warrant solvency, or courts approve a public company's reduction. Because a company buying back shares from shareholders in itself, or taking back <b>redeemable</b> <b>shares,</b> has the same effect as a reduction of capital, similar transparency and procedural requirements need to be fulfilled. Public companies are also precluded from giving financial assistance for purchase of their shares, for example through a leveraged buyout, unless the company is delisted and or taken private. Finally, in order to protect investors from being placed at an unfair disadvantage, people inside a company are under a strict duty to not trade on any information that could affect a company's share price for their own benefit.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{show that}} Japan {{will not be}} able to have a viable banking sector without {{stopping}} deflation. The banking industry has not shown a profit since fiscal 1993 (ended March 1994) if one excludes capital gains from stock and real estate portfolios. I quantify the financial condition of the sector and show that interest margins have been too low to cover the increase in loan losses brought about by the weak economy. Banks cannot raise margins for several reasons: competition with subsidized government sponsored financial institutions (GFIs); intense political pressure, backed by the Financial Services Agency (FSA), to make new loans to small and medium companies; and deflation-weakened borrowers. I expect that the Japanese government will have to nationalize most of the banking sector by 2005. Capital injections will not solve the problems. Established Japanese life insurance companies are also troubled because they over-promised the amount that they could pay. This can be corrected through a reorganization where the promised interest rates are cut. But this is complicated because Japanese banks and life insurance companies are providing each other capital a practice called double-gearing. Weakened banks ask insurance companies to provide equity capital and subordinated loans. In return, the mutual life insurers ask banks to subscribe their surplus notes (similar to non-voting <b>redeemable</b> preferred <b>shares)</b> and subordinated debt. The risks of double-gearing are analyzed. ...|$|R
40|$|Project finance is {{analysed}} {{in three}} separate papers plus a survey. The survey highlights, inter alia, the recent development of multi-stage models with learning and reputation. The following two chapters develop models where projects involve {{a sequence of}} investments, while the final chapter is an empirical study. In Chapter Two an entrepreneur makes an initial investment and then faces an optimal stopping problem. It is socially optimal to terminate a high cost project when costs become known sufficiently early. But, due to past investments being sunk costs, there is a cut-off point after which completion of projects is always optimal. With asymmetric learning the entrepreneur may conceal bad state realisations from investors until after the cut-off date. The stopping problem is sometimes resolved by a loan commitment (a single-stage mechanism) and sometimes by convertible and <b>redeemable</b> Preference <b>shares</b> (a two-stage mechanism). In Chapter Three an entrepreneur begins with a project {{in the form of}} a call option with two periods to maturity. One period latter another project becomes available. Exercise decisions are observable but non-contractible and contracts to finance the second project cannot be written in advance of its arrival. With symmetric information about state realisations a simple rule for whether the two projects are best incorporated jointly as a single firm or separately as legally distinct firms is given. If joint incorporation is optimal, a contractual covenant to this effect may be required to overcome a time-inconsistency problem. With asymmetric information the exercise decision for the first project becomes a signalling game with a premature-investment pooling equilibrium. The time-inconsistency problem now becomes a useful device for eliminating the pooling equilibrium. The analysis implies that the covenants attached to financial contracts may differ according to whether information is symmetric or asymmetric. Finally, Chapter Four studies a unique sample of high growth entrepreneurial firms financed by 3 i PLC. We characterise financing arrangements for these firms and discusses their relation with theories of optimal capital structure. Probit analysis is used to study the relation between collateral and risk. Contrary to the significant positive relation found by recent studies, we find no significant relation between collateral and risk...|$|R
