40|$|The review {{under this}} SRP section covers the <b>radiological</b> <b>consequences</b> {{of the release}} of fission {{products}} from irradiated fuel in a spent fuel cask that is postulated to drop during cask handling operations. SRP Section 15. 7. 4 covers the <b>radiological</b> <b>consequences</b> of fuel handling accidents in which an object is dropped onto irradiated fuel resulting in the release of fission products from the stored fuel. SRP Section 15. 7. 4 also includes {{the consequences of a}} fuel cask dropping or tipping onto irradiated fuel in the spent fuel pool. The ASB evaluates the spent fuel cask handling system under SRP Section 9. 1. 4. The AEB reviewer, as explained below, will verify various design and operations aspects of the system with the ASB as a secondary review branch. The points covered in the AEB review are as follows: 1. ASB is consulted to verify the potential drop height during handling of a loaded cask and the procedures for handling the cask with respect to the impact limiter. If the handling procedures meet all applicable criteria, then the <b>radiological</b> <b>consequences</b> of a spent fuel cask drop accident need not be estimated. 2. A design basis radiological analysis is performed if a cask drop exceeding 30 feet can be postulated or if limiting devices are removed during cask handling within the plant so the 30 -foot drop height is exceeded. If the <b>radiological</b> <b>consequences</b> of a cask drop accident are to be computed, then information on whether building leaktightness can be expected after a cask drop is obtained from ASB (e. g., whether the technical specifications. require large doors to be closed during fuel handling or whether ventilatio...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{probabilistic}} safety assessment, a {{risk evaluation}} framework for an aircraft crash into an interim {{spent fuel storage}} facility is presented. Damage evaluation of a detailed generic cask model in a simplified building structure under an aircraft impact is discussed through a numerical structural analysis and an analytical fragility assessment. Sequences of the impact scenario are shown in a developed event tree, with uncertainties considered in the impact analysis and failure probabilities calculated. To evaluate the influence of parameters relevant to design safety, risks are estimated for three specification levels of cask and storage facility structures. The proposed assessment procedure includes {{the determination of the}} loading parameters, reference impact scenario, structural response analyses of facility walls, cask containment, and fuel assemblies, and a <b>radiological</b> <b>consequence</b> analysis with dose–risk estimation. The risk results for the proposed scenario in this study are expected to be small relative to those of design basis accidents for best-estimated conservative values.

40|$|APPLICATION OF EULER-LAGRANGE METHOD IN SPATIAL ESTIMATION OF POLLUTANT IN ADVECTION DOMINANT CONDITION. Radiation dose {{analysis}} {{to the public}} near nuclear facility is used to assess environmental impact in normal operation of the facility to avoid exceedance of prescribed limit and to assess <b>radiological</b> <b>consequence</b> in an emergency. Before dose can be determined, spatial variation of radioactive effluent should be determined first. Solution of advection-diffusion equation is generally employed to obtain approximation of pollutant distribution in the atmosphere in a certain area. Advection-diffusion equation gives continuous representative of a system containing Brownian (diffusion) and deterministic movement (advection). Analytical solution is generally not available since the equation may arise as non-linear coupled equations. Therefore, numerical integration employing finite difference method is often used. Stability and accuracy should be dealt with, especially in advection dominant case. Euler-Lagrange solution is used {{to solve the problem}} by dividing the solution into two parts: particle tracking for the advection part and Eulerian for the dispersion part. The two processes are executed alternatingly to obtain concentration at a certain point. Interpolating method used is linear. The solution is applied only in 1 and 2 dimensions with spontaneous and continuous sources and constant moving direction and diffusion parameter. Despite the simplification, the result indicates that the method is applicable to problems where advection is moderately or significantly dominant, as indicated by the high Peclet number.

40|$|A {{potential}} source of fission product leakage following a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) is the leakage past the main steam isolation valves in a BWR. This leakage is controlled by a main steam isolation valve leakage control system (MSIViJCS). This system may be a positive sealing system or a vacuum type system which collects leakage between the closed isolation valves and releases it to the atmosphere through a filter system. The AEB reviews the method of operation, time of opera-tion, and release paths associated with operation of the MSIVLCS to calculate the fission product releases and {{their contributions to the}} doses following a LOCA at the exclusion area and low population zone boundary.

The team developed five scenarios upon which to build the data quality objectives (DQOs) that they considered necessary to ensure a comprehensive consequence management response from the DOE perspective. The resulting document was called the Consequence Management Mission Analysis. Based upon the positive reaction to this document and its obvious benefit to the Consequence Management mission, it was decided to expand the scope of the document to cover a mission analysis of the entire Federal Radiological Monitoring and Assessment Center (FRMAC) mission.

This is particularly so given that it is anticipated that nuclear energy will become a mainstay for economies in these regions within the foreseeable future. Therefore data acquisition and use of parameter values have been concentrated primarily on these climate types. Atmospheric dispersion and deposition for Australia can be modelled and supplied by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre (RSMC one of five in the world) {{which is part of the}} Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre (BMRC) Puri et al. (1992). RadCon combines these data (i. e. the time dependent air and ground concentration generated by the dispersion model or measured quantities in the case of an actual incident) with specific regional parameter values to determine the dose to people via the major pathways of external and internal irradiation. For the external irradiation calculations data are needed on lifestyle information such as the time spent indoors/outdoors the high/low physical activity rates for different groups of people (especially critical groups) and shielding factors for housing types. For the internal irradiation calculations data are needed on food consumption effect of food processing transfer parameters (soil to plant plant to animal) and interception values appropriate for the region under study. Where the relevant data are not available default temperate data are currently used. The results of a wide ranging literature search has highlighted where specific research will be initiated to determine the information required for tropical and sub-tropical regions.
