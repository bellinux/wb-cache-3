2500|$|The first {{purpose-built}} express reefer {{emerged from}} the Erie Railroad Susquehanna Shops on August 1, 1886. By 1927, some 2,218 express cars traveled America's rails, and three years later that number rose to 3,264. In 1940, private rail lines began to build and operate their own reefers, the Railway Express Agency (REA) being by far the largest. In 1948, the REA roster (which would continue to expand into the 1950s) numbered approximately 1,800 cars, {{many of which were}} World War II [...] "troop sleepers" [...] modified for express <b>refrigerated</b> <b>transport.</b> By 1965, due to a decline in refrigerated traffic, many express reefers were leased to railroads for use as bulk mail carriers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{refrigerated}} {{rail car}} (refrigerated van or refrigerator car), {{along with the}} dense railroad network, became an exceedingly important link between the marketplace and the farm allowing for a national opportunity rather than a just a regional one. Before {{the invention of the}} refrigerated rail car it was impossible to ship perishable food products long distances. The beef packing industry made the first demand push for refrigeration cars. The railroad companies were slow to adopt this new invention because of their heavy investments in cattle cars, stockyards, and feedlots. [...] Refrigeration cars were also complex and costly compared to other rail cars, which also slowed the adoption of the refrigerated rail car. [...] After the slow adoption of the refrigerated car, the beef packing industry dominated the refrigerated rail car business with their ability to control ice plants and the setting of icing fees. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated that in 1916 over sixty-nine percent of the cattle killed in the country was done in plants involved in interstate trade. [...] The same companies that were also involved in the meat trade later implemented <b>refrigerated</b> <b>transport</b> to include vegetables and fruit. [...] The meat packing companies had much of the expensive machinery, such as refrigerated cars, and cold storage facilities that allowed for them to effectively distribute all types of perishable goods. [...] During World War I, a national refrigerator car pool was established by the United States Administration to deal with problem of idle cars and was later continued after the war. [...] The idle car problem was the problem of refrigeration cars sitting pointlessly in between seasonal harvests. [...] This meant that very expensive cars sat in rail yards for {{a good portion of the}} year while making no revenue for the car’s owner. [...] The car pool was a system where cars were distributed to areas as crops matured ensuring maximum use of the cars. Refrigerated rail cars moved eastward from vineyards, orchards, fields, and gardens in western states to satisfy Americas consuming market in the east. [...] The refrigerated car made it possible to transport perishable crops hundreds and even thousands of miles. The most noticeable effect the car gave was a regional specialization of vegetables and fruits. The refrigeration rail car was widely used for the transportation of perishable goods up until the 1950s. [...] By the 1960s the nation's interstate highway system was adequately complete allowing for trucks to carry the majority of the perishable food loads and to push out the old system of the refrigerated rail cars.|$|E

Scope for expanding and diversifying its export markets is large. Demand for fruits and vegetables is growing in nearby international markets, like the Middle East. Although Ethiopia is land locked, it is geographically close to the Middle East. To reach the Middle East, and other international markets, produce has to be transported to Djibouti {{where it can be}} shipped. Roads to Djibouti are generally good, but transportation takes long due to long waiting times at the border, sometimes up to ten hours. Fresh produce is sensitive and needs to be refrigerated to remain fresh and of good quality during such long transportation time.
