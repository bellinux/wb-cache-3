50|$|The Roots <b>type</b> <b>blower</b> is a {{positive}} displacement lobe pump which operates by pumping a fluid {{with a pair of}} meshing lobes not unlike a set of stretched gears. Fluid is trapped in pockets surrounding the lobes and carried from the intake side to the exhaust. The most common application of the Roots <b>type</b> <b>blower</b> has been as the induction device on two-stroke Diesel engines, such as those produced by Detroit Diesel and Electro-Motive Diesel. Roots <b>type</b> <b>blowers</b> are also used to supercharge Otto cycle engines, with the blower being driven from the engine's crankshaft via a toothed or V-belt, a roller chain or a gear train.|$|R
50|$|The Roots-type blower may {{achieve an}} {{efficiency}} of around 70% while achieving a maximum pressure ratio of two. Because a Roots <b>type</b> <b>blower</b> pumps air in discrete pulses (unlike a screw compressor), pulsation noise and turbulence may be transmitted downstream. If not properly managed (through outlet piping geometry) or accounted for (by structural reinforcement of downstream components), the resulting pulsations can cause fluid cavitation and/or damage to components downstream of the blower.|$|R
50|$|All Series 71 engines use uniflow scavenging, where a gear-driven Roots <b>type</b> <b>blower</b> {{mounted to}} the {{exterior}} of the engine provides intake air through cored passages in the engine block and ports in the cylinder walls at slightly greater than atmospheric pressure. The engine exhausts through pushrod-operated poppet valves in the cylinder head(s), with either two or four valves per cylinder. Unit injection is employed, one injector per cylinder, with no high fuel pressure outside of the injector body. The injectors are cycled from the same camshaft responsible for opening the exhaust valves.|$|R
50|$|In {{the winter}} of 1926/7 the factory's service {{department}} created the first supercharged Bentley when chassis number 220 FR5189 had a Roots <b>type</b> <b>blower</b> fitted to its 3-litre engine. This pre-dated the Birkin supercharged Bentleys by two years. Like the later 4½ litre supercharged cars its blower was crankshaft-driven and mounted {{in front of the}} radiator between the dumb irons. Unlike them its carburettor was mounted {{on the left side of}} the engine block. A rather circuitous intake tract carries the fuel-air mixture forward from there to the blower. On 4½ litre cars the carburettor is mounted on the blower, as commonly done on other supercharged British cars with front-mounted blowers.|$|R
5000|$|The Roots <b>type</b> <b>blower</b> {{is named}} after the American inventors and {{brothers}} Philander and Francis Marion Roots, founders of the Roots Blower Company of Connersville, Indiana USA, who patented the basic design in 1860 as an air pump for use in blast furnaces and other industrial applications. In 1900, Gottlieb Daimler included a Roots-style blower in a patented engine design, making the Roots-type blower {{the oldest of the}} various designs now available. Roots blowers are commonly referred to as air blowers or PD (positive displacement) blowers, and can be commonly called [...] "huffers" [...] when used with the gasoline-burning engines in hot rod customized cars.|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} axial blowers {{operate on}} the high-pressure principle. One drawback of this <b>type</b> of <b>blower</b> is the relatively low pressure head, which one attempts to overcome with axial blowers producing very high pressure at a given circumferential speed.

5000|$|As a {{two stroke}} cycle Diesel engine cannot {{naturally}} aspirate, or draw {{in its own}} intake air, the blower is necessary to provide air in an amount sufficient both for scavenging of exhaust gasses from the cylinder and to support combustion. Initial versions of the 6-110 engine used a centrifugal-type supercharger. This was very practical for fixed-speed applications such as marine or generator service, but proved a failure in automotive applications. [...] "The engine was developed on the dyno and was never operated above rated RPM. The first application was in Euclid mining trucks, where the driver's income depends on how fast he drives the empty truck {{back down into the}} pit. The centrifugal blower ran about 10 times engine speed. Exceeding that RPM was fatal, and in a truck a single missed downshift could mean a failed engine." [...] For that reason a Roots <b>type</b> <b>blower</b> was made available as an option after about 1952. Later high performance versions were available with turbochargers.|$|R
40|$|For maximum {{operating}} efficiency of Roots <b>type</b> <b>blowers,</b> the leakage of compressed air through clearance must {{be reduced to}} a minimum. At the same time it is desirable to keep the design as compact as possible. The following analysis endeavours to show, for involute rotors, the effect of the geometrical design variables, pressure angle, rotor tip radius, and base circle radius, on leakage and compactness. Firstly limits of permissible values of the geometrical design variables, to allow correct mating between rotors, are established. Within these limits, relative blower compactness and carry-over of compressed air back to the inlet tract is obtained for the ideal blower with no clearance between relative rotating parts. The analysis and results are expressed in dimensionless form independent of blower size, and results are compared with cycloid rotors. Leakage through blower clearances, in terms of the geometrical design variables, is then determined for a range of pressure ratios, and the dependence on blower size is examined. It is concluded that optimum design values cannot be obtained. A compromise solution between minimum total leakage and maximum compactness is necessary, depending on the operating requirements for a particular Roots blower...|$|R
50|$|Simple {{two-stroke}} engines with ported inlet and exhaust {{cannot be}} supercharged since the inlet port always closes first. For this reason, two-stroke Diesel engines usually have mechanical exhaust valves with separate timing to allow supercharging. Regardless of this, two-stroke engines require scavenging at all engine speeds and so turbocharged two-stroke engines must still employ a <b>blower,</b> usually Roots <b>type.</b> This <b>blower</b> may be mechanically or electrically driven, {{in either case}} the blower may be disengaged once the turbocharger starts to deliver air.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "blower" [...] is {{commonly}} used to define a device placed on engines with a functional need for additional airflow using a direct mechanical link as its energy source. The term blower is used to describe different types of superchargers.

5000|$|The twin-screw type {{supercharger}} is {{a positive}} displacement type device that operates by pushing air through a pair of meshing close-tolerance screws similar {{to a set of}} worm gears. Twin-screw superchargers are also known as Lysholm superchargers (or compressors) after their inventor, Alf Lysholm.Each rotor is radially symmetrical, but laterally asymmetric. By comparison, conventional [...] "Roots" [...] <b>type</b> <b>blowers</b> have either identical rotors (with straight rotors) or mirror-image rotors (with helixed rotors). The Whipple-manufactured male rotor has three lobes, the female five lobes. The Kenne-Bell male rotor has four lobes, the female six lobes. Females in some earlier designs had four. By comparison, Roots blowers always have the same number of lobes on both rotors, typically 2, 3 or 4.The working area is the inter-lobe volume between the male and female rotors. It’s larger at the intake end, and decreases {{along the length of the}} rotors until the exhaust port. This change in volume is the compression. The intake charge is drawn in at the end of the rotors in the large clearance between the male and female lobes. At the intake end the male lobe is much smaller than its female counterpart, but the relative sizes reverse proportions along the lengths of both rotors (the male becomes larger and the female smaller) until (tangential to the discharge port) the clearance space between each pair of lobes is much smaller. This reduction in volume causes compression of the charge before being presented to the output manifold.|$|R

These <b>types</b> of <b>blowers</b> are designed to handle gas streams with low to moderate particulate loadings [...] They can be easily fitted with wear protection but certain blade curvatures can be prone to solids build-up..

40|$|Gas {{pulsations}} commonly {{exist in}} HVACR, energy and automotive industry. They {{are believed to}} be a major source for system inefficiency, vibrations, noises and fatigue failures. It has been widely accepted that gas pulsations mainly take place at the discharge side of a positive displacement (PD) type compressor such as a screw, scroll or internal combustion engine. The pulsation magnitudes, ranging from a fraction to a few bars, are especially significant at off-design conditions of either under-compression (UC) or over-compression (OC). Traditionally, a serial pulsation dampener, often a reactive type silencer, is connected after the compressor or engine discharge. It is capable of reducing pressure pulsation by 10 plus fold; or 20 plus dB. However these dampeners are bulky and impose sizable back pressure losses. This paper discusses an alternative method, a shunt pulsation trap (SPT), using a parallel configuration, which tackles the gas pulsations before the compressor or engine discharge. The SPT method is based on the shock tube theory [1] that characterizes the nature of gas pulsation as a composition of non-linear waves, compression wave (CW) and expansion wave (EW) and induced fluid flow (IFF). The theory also predicts that the dominant source of gas pulsation is a direct result from the sudden discharging process under UC or OC condition. Two prototypes, 75 HP and 350 HP Roots <b>type</b> <b>blowers,</b> were built and tested with and without SPT. The experimental results partially validate the new theory and also indicate a 10 plus fold; or 20 plus dB pulsation reduction by using SPT under different load and speed conditions without suffering any back pressure losses...|$|R

40|$|Gas {{pulsations}} {{are defined}} presently as a macro flow rate and/or pressure fluctuation with relatively low frequency and high amplitude. They commonly exist in HVACR, energy and other processing industries, and are widely accepted to be {{mainly caused by}} PD type gas machinery such as reciprocating or rotary compressors, expanders and Roots <b>type</b> <b>blowers.</b> Moreover, they {{are believed to be}} responsible for system vibrations, noises and fatigue failures. Naturally, as important a matter as gas pulsations, there have been tremendous R/D efforts from both academia and industry focused in this area, especially since the late 1980 s. The most well known works are acoustic models based on small perturbation and CFD methods aimed at solving nonlinear unsteady differential equations for pulsating flows. Both approaches have been successful in calculating gas pulsations at off-design conditions of either an under-compression, UC (over-expansion, OE) or over-compression, OC (under-expansion, UE). However, due to the transient nature of pulsation phenomena, some fundamental questions still remain to be answered, such as: What is the physical nature of gas pulsations? What exactly causes them to happen? Where and when are they generated? How are they different from acoustical waves and how to predict their behaviors such as amplitude, travelling direction and speed at source? This paper attempts to answer these questions by taking a different approach: applying the classical Shock Tube Theory to gas pulsation phenomena. The results not only confirm the findings of the previous workers, but also reveal the nature of gas pulsations as a composition of strong bi-directional waves and an accompanying unidirectional through-flow. Moreover, the pressure pulsations consist of pressure waves (coalescing into a quasi-shockwave) and a fan of finite expansion waves travelling in opposite directions, while the flow pulsation is simply the induced unidirectional flow as these strong waves sweep across the gas. It will be further demonstrated that the most dominant gas pulsations are the direct results from either an OC (or UE) or an UC (or OE) suddenly discharging at the compressor or expander outlet. Therefore its location of generation, magnitude, travelling directions and speed can be predicted based on design parameters and operating conditions of those machines. Based on this new insight, an effective pulsation control method called Pulsation Trap can be devised that tackles the non-linear waves and strong induced flow simultaneously and right at the predicted sources...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{established}} that for a Positive Displacement (PD) compressor or expander such as reciprocating or rotary screw type, the thermodynamic process is adiabatic when compressor or expander discharge pressure is equal to system back pressure (or 100 % internal compression or expansion). At this design point, compressor or expander efficiency and noise are most desirable. But more often, PD compressor or expander operates at off-design points where the discharge pressure is either lower or higher than the system back pressure caused by the inherent nature of possessing a fixed built-in volume ratio. The resulting processes are often called an Under-Compression abbreviated as UC (or Over-Expansion, OE) and an Over-Compression, OC (or Under-Expansion, UE), and the thermodynamic process suddenly changes to iso-choric (constant volume). The compressor or expander efficiency and noise become worse at these off-design conditions and some type of controls are always desired such as a variable geometry {{in order to minimize}} the losses. On the other hand, there have been test observations that seem to contradict the conventional theory, pointing to the dramatic difference of the thermodynamic processes between an UC and internal compression. So questions arise: What is the true thermodynamic process of an UC? What really does the compression at the instant when the gas is exposed to higher system pressure? How is energy exchanged during an UC cycle? And why does UC possess the unique self-adjusting capability to different system pressures? This paper attempts to re-exam these questions by applying the 1 st Law of Thermodynamics to UC (or OE) mode. It will be demonstrated that an UC (or OE) may inherently be an adiabatic process with compression achieved by a “flexible” backflow rather than a “rigid” piston or lobe. The energy exchange, in addition to work input from shaft to gas, is assisted by a dynamic process of “borrow and return” with the discharge system. It will be further explored that the mechanism of backflow compression is in essence a wave compression as illustrated by the Shock Tube Theory. Potential efficiency of an UC or OE could be close to the classical internal compression if the high velocity backflow is managed properly. But the best or maybe the most overlooked property seems to be its “feedback” capability, that is, an UC is a self-correcting, negative feedback control loop capable of meeting different system back pressures without using any variable geometry.

The electricity consumption of blower motors depends on the static pressure across the blower. This paper examines both <b>types</b> of <b>blower</b> motors in non-condensing non-weatherized gas furnaces at a range of static pressures. Fan performance data is based on manufacturer product literature and laboratory tests. We use field-measured static pressure in ducts to get typical system curves to calculate how furnaces would operate in the field. We contrast this with the electricity consumption of a furnace blower operating under the DOE test procedure and manufacturer rated conditions. Furnace electricity use is also affected by operating modes that happen {{at the beginning and end}} of each furnace firing cycle. These operating modes are the pre-purge and post-purge by the draft inducer, the on-delay and off-delay of the blower, and the hot surface ignitor operation. To accurately calculate this effect, we use the number of firing cycles in a typical California house in the Central Valley of California. Cooling hours are not considered in the DOE test procedure. We also account for furnace blower use by the air conditioner and stand-by power. Overall BPM motors outperform PSC motors, but the total electricity savings are significantly less than projected using the DOE test procedure conditions.

One cowling included a blower mounted on the rear face of a large propeller spinner which drew cooling air in through side entrance ducts located behind the equivalent engine orifice plate. The air was passed through the equivalent engine orifice plate from rear to front and out through a slot between the spinner and the engine plate. The blower produced substantially all the power necessary to circulate the cooling air in some cases, so the quantity of air flowing was independent of the air speed, Two <b>types</b> of <b>blowers</b> were used, a centrifugal type and one using airfoil blades which forced the air outward {{from the center of}} rotation.

The tests show that with both cowling types the basic drag of the nacelle was reduced substantially below that for the N. A. C.

The drag due to the side-entrance ducts was nearly zero when the openings were closed or when the blower was drawing in a certain quantity of air in proportion to the air speed.

Detailed power distributions were measured in the 11 typical positions. Subcritical and critical rod worth curves were obtained in the critical experiment with up to 132 shim rods in the core. Moderator temperature coefficient measurements were made and agreed well with analytical data. Critical experiment correlation of fine radial power calculations in the revised mock-up showed good agreement. Performance specifications were prepared for a 1 -Mw(e) power plant. Parametric thermal analyses, based on various tube sheet thicknesses and heating rates, were completed for {{the top and bottom}} tube sheets. The shield plug was redesigned to accommodate additional shim rods and to facilitate fabrication and moderator flow adjustments. Calculations of the operating and shutdown dose at the nuclear sensor location was started. Studies were performed to determine the size of the port openings needed to prevent buckling in the containmert vessel in the event of ship sinking. A blower shaft static seal was built and tested with satisfactory results. Manufacture and procurement of all parts for two developmental dynamic rod actuators were completed. The two-tube boiler was modified and operated satisfactorily on automatic control down to 20 percent power. A reactor control system that meets response and accuracy requirements was simulated on the analog computer. Investigation of a possible test site for power testing the prototype reactor was continued with cost estimates and a facility layout drawing being made for the IET facility at ITS. Specimen ORF- 4 was removed from test after 4800 hours of actual operation at 1300 deg F, equivalent to approximately 15, 000 hours of full- power 630 A operation. An estimated 40 percent burnup of the /sup 235 /U atoms occurred. Creep tests on warm-finished fuel sheet have accumulated more than 12, 000 hours at 630 A stress and temperature conditions with no greater than 0. 75 percent plastic creep. Cladding-stock creep tests have surpassed 15, 000 hours at various combinations of stress and temperature with satisfactory results. (auth...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{a series}} of {{laboratory}} measurements was conducted on residential air handling units (AHUs) and air conditioners to characterize their performance at typical installed conditions. In addition, performance models of blowers and air conditioners were developed from the laboratory measurements and integrated with building energy simulations to predict the energy consumption and the life cycle cost of ductworks with respect to different climates (Chicago, IL and Austin, TX), duct materials (e. g., sheet metal and flex ducts), flow resistances, and <b>blower</b> <b>types</b> (e. g. PSC and ECM blowers). The experimental results showed that PSC and ECM blowers have distinct airflow, power, and efficiency performance in response to increases in the external static pressure (ESP). The building energy simulation results showed that increasing the duct flow resistance from 0. 3 to 0. 9 in. w. g. (75 to 225 Pa) decreased airflow rates of PSC blowers and consequently decreased the annual blower electricity consumptions by 11 % for the Austin home and 16 % for the Chicago home. However, in systems with ECM blowers the same increase in the duct flow resistance increased the annual blower electricity consumptions by about 60 % for both the Austin home and the Chicago home, primarily because ECM blowers maintained constant airflow rates over a range of pressures. For the same increase in the duct flow resistance, the electricity consumptions of condensing units in systems with PSC blowers increased by 2. 7 % for the Austin home and 5. 5 % for the Chicago home, while the electricity increase in systems with ECM blowers were less dramatic, being 1. 6 % for the Austin home and 1. 5 % for the Chicago home. Also, the simulation results indicated that although the cost-effectiveness of a specific duct design is shown to be heavily dependent on initial duct fabrication and installation costs, the use of lower flow resistance ductworks generally leads to lifetime savings {{in the presence of}} supply and return leakages of 10 %. Specifically, the lifetime savings is achieved in 6 out of 8 simulated cases for the Chicago home and all of the simulated cases for the Austin home by using ductworks at lower flow resistances...|$|R
40|$|Researches are {{conducted}} in vineyard and apple orchard with two different <b>types</b> of mist <b>blowers,</b> axial (Hardi Zaturn) and radial (Hardi Arrow). The influence of major technical spraying factors (type of nozzle, working speed and spray volume) were observed on {{coverage of the}} treated area, average droplet diameter, number of droplets per cm 2 and drift. The working speed of sprayer was set at 6 and 8 km/h, and spray volume on 250, 325 and 400 l/ha for apple orchard and 250, 300 and 350 l/ha for vineyard. Researchers used Lechler blue (TR 8003), yellow (TR 8002) and green (TR 80015) nozzles. The research was set as three - factorial field experiment with 18 treatments in 4 repetitions, for different type of sprayer and permanent crops. We used 60 water sensitive papers for that treatment, which were processed with digital image analysis and ImageJ software. In addition to the main features of the research, research showed leaf area index and density, speed and flow of air current, working pressure, orientation of the nozzles and weather conditions, which were monitored during the study. Before the research, mist blowers are tested according to the European standard 13790. By decreasing the ISO number of nozzles and by increasing the working speed and spray volume, we found increase of area coverage, number of droplets per cm 2 and drift, and decrease of average droplet diameter. Also, {{by comparing the results}} of research exploitation by axial and radial mist blower in the vineyards and apple orchards, better results are achieved with radial mist blower (Hardi Arrow) in both cases. The best relationship of area coverage and liquid drift in vineyard were achieved with 64. 22 % area coverage and 17. 11 % of liquid drift (green nozzle, working speed of 6 km/h, spray volume of 350 l/ha, and working pressure of 10. 99 bar). In apple orchard the best relationship of area coverage and liquid drift were achieved with 59. 55 % area coverage and 21. 10 % of liquid drift (green nozzle, working speed of 8 km/h, spray volume of 325 l/ha, and working pressure of 16. 84 bar) ...|$|R
50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time overload operation. By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 turbulent P.F. burners arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two forced draught fans which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative air heaters to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The air heaters are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber water wall tubes by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary super heater bank, pendant super heater platens, and pendant final super heater bank. The super heater platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as convection. The other heaters being later in the gas duct rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary super heater and the super heater platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final super heater inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for re-heating at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the gas duct. Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type attemperators. The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun <b>type</b> soot <b>blowers</b> in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the super heater and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced draught fans which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no mechanical collectors.|$|R
