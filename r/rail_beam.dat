After running 15 years, the corrosion quantity of <b>rail</b> <b>beam</b> rebar is 0. 7 mm, in the late period of development steel corrosion, directly affects the structure of bearing capacity. The corrosion of reinforcement concrete and reinforced area decreasing, reinforced bite force weakened, lead to a significant long-term operation structure safety hazard. On the assumption that, under the rebar corrosion quantity with running time, {{the structure of the}} bearing capacity of growth will no longer meet the requirement of the engineering specifications.

3000|$|As a {{standard}} of public transport, the vertical dynamic action of monorail determines many problems like the safety of train operation, the riding comfort and the vertical force of <b>rail</b> <b>beam</b> [2, 3]. The vertical dynamics is mainly caused by {{the interaction of the}} <b>rail</b> <b>beam</b> and the body (bogie), and the surface roughness of the track beam is the mechanism of its formation. The straddle-type monorail track beam is divided into two kinds of PC beam (prestressed reinforced concrete beam and steel structure beam), they are all prefabricated and finished, and so the surface smoothness is very good. (At least they are close to the US road A road surface, but because there is no relevant research, so we lack specific data.) The gap between the beam and the beam, which called finger-band, is considered to be the largest vertical excitation source in the track beam, so if we want to study the vertical dynamics of straddle-type monorail, we must study its vertical dynamics at the finger-band.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of horizontal bracing restraints provided by the friction between pallet bases and <b>rail</b> <b>beams</b> on the static behaviour and design of steel drive-in storage racks. The pallet bracing restraints are shown to significantly influence the structural behaviour of the rack, and their effect on the bending moment distribution of the uprights is studied in the paper. The 2 D single upright model proposed by Godley is improved in this study by including the restraints provided by the plan flexural stiffness of the <b>rail</b> <b>beams</b> and the friction between the pallets and <b>rail</b> <b>beams.</b> The improved 2 D model was found to accurately reproduce the bending moment distributions obtained using 3 D advanced finite element analysis. The 2 D single upright model is used to analyse 36 drive-in racks under various load case combinations. The paper evaluates {{the influence of}} the pallet bracing restraints on the ultimate capacity of drive-in racks, clarifies the loading pattern(s) governing the structural design and determines the friction coefficient, or strength of a restraining device, required to prevent the pallets from sliding. It is shown that while restraints from pallets could potentially be considered in design, they would not lead to more economic structural solutions.

40|$|Drive-in steel {{storage racks}} {{represent}} a popular {{alternative to the}} more common selective racks when available space is restricted or when storing the same good. In drive-in racks, the forklift truck drives into the rack and stores the pallets on <b>beam</b> <b>rails</b> on the "first-in last-out" principle. Recent experimental {{studies have shown that}} by acting as horizontal ties between uprights, pallets significantly influence the structural behaviour of the rack. However, due to the uncertainty in the degree of friction between the <b>rail</b> <b>beams</b> and the pallets, current industry design practice does not consider this effect. This paper quantifies the influence of the pallets on the bending moment distribution in the uprights using a 3 D finite element model calibrated against experimental results on a full scale drive-in rack. Additionally, as 3 D models may be computationally intensive when a large number of analyses are required, this paper presents an improved version of the 2 D model of drive-in racks introduced by Godley. In the improved 2 D model, all possible loading scenarios and the influence of pallets on the structural behaviour of the rack are considered. When compared to advanced 3 D finite element analyses, the model is able to accurately reproduce the bending moment distribution in the upright, with and without the presence of pallets.
