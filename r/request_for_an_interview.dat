500|$|As of 2012, Ambrose's 405 Test wickets {{place him}} 11th {{on the list}} of leading Test wicket-takers. Of those who have taken over 200 Test wickets, Ambrose has the third best bowling average behind Malcolm Marshall and Joel Garner, and has the eighth best economy rate; he rises to third if only those who have taken over 250 wickets are included. For much of his career, Ambrose was rated the world's best bowler in the ICC player rankings, first {{reaching}} the top in 1991; he rarely dropped below second and was ranked in the top 10 from 1989 until the end of his career. His highest rating of 912 in the rankings, which he achieved in 1994, is the equal sixth best rating of all time. In 2010, Ambrose was chosen by a panel of writers and experts as a member of ESPNcricinfo's [...] "All-Time XI" [...] for West Indies. The following year, he was inducted into the International Cricket Council Hall of Fame. During his playing days, Ambrose had a reputation for reticence, and rarely spoke to journalists or the opposition. His response to a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> in 1991—"Curtly talks to no-one"— became associated with him throughout his career, but he was more willing to talk to journalists after he retired.|$|E

He was moved from drifters shortly after the action, becoming sick and spending {{the remainder of the}} year in hospital in Malta before being brought home to receive his award at Buckingham Palace and serve on light duties as a Chief Skipper.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, NBC field {{reporter}} Jim Gray, who {{had previously}} covered Major League Baseball for CBS, came under fire for a confrontational interview with banned all-time hit king Pete Rose. Just {{prior to the start}} of Game 2 of the World Series, Gray pushed Rose – on hand (by permission of Commissioner Bud Selig) at Turner Field in Atlanta as a fan-selected member of MasterCard's All-Century Team – to admit to having wagered on baseball games as manager of the Cincinnati Reds ten years earlier. After NBC was flooded with tons of viewer complaints, Gray was forced to clarify his actions to the viewers at home prior to Game 3. Regardless of Gray's sincerity, Game 3 hero Chad Curtis of the New York Yankees boycotted Gray's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> live on camera; Curtis had hit a game-winning home run to send the World Series 3–0 in the Yankees' favor.

25|$|Although Fahey's Maria Duce {{organisation}} {{was initially}} left {{to its own}} devices, Archbishop McQuaid grew less sympathetic {{to it in the}} latter half of the 1950s.

McQuaid went as far as to write to Fahey in 1954 stating that he opposed the latter's association of the name of the Blessed Virgin Mary with his organisation. Fahey died before any response could be made, and the group was disbanded the following year; McQuaid took on the group afterward.|$|R
25|$|In May 1568 Mary, Queen of Scots fled to England, {{and flung}} herself on Elizabeth's protection. She had found refuge in Carlisle Castle, and the {{delicate}} duty of {{taking charge of}} the fugitive was entrusted jointly to Knollys and to Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton. On 28 May Knollys arrived at the castle, and was admitted to Mary's presence. At his first interview he was conscious of Mary's powerful fascination. But to her <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with Elizabeth, and for help to regain her throne, he returned the evasive answers which Elizabeth's advisers had suggested to him, and he frankly drew {{her attention to the}} suspicions in which Darnley's murder involved her.|$|R

5000|$|She {{remained}} {{in close contact}} with the Gandhis, regularly visiting Mr and Mrs Gandhi at their Phoenix Settlement for Indians, and moved there to join the satyagraha campaign. She bought a cottage nearby at Ohlanga, as <b>a</b> base <b>for</b> her work to support several movements operating from the area, including the Gandhis, and those of early African statesmen such as John Dube. In speeches given with Gandhi at meetings in Durban she urged Indians to identify with Africa. The Gandhis came to Cape Town in 1914 and Miss Molteno worked to facilitate their meetings with the most powerful political figures in South Africa. She also facilitated their introduction to Emily Hobhouse and the Prime Minister himself, General Botha, who had long ignored Gandhi's <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> but thereafter maintained cordial communications. Gandhi was later to write about Miss Molteno's role as [...] "peacemaker", enabling him to make contact {{with some of the most}} powerful figures in the country.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the same}} issue of New Yorker, its {{editor-in-chief}} David Remnick wrote an editorial supporting Hersh's research and conclusions.

He and his troops won extraordinary praise <b>for</b> <b>a</b> four-day march under bleak conditions. Hersh, however, {{in the course of}} conducting hundreds of interviews and reviewing thousands of pages of government and Army documents, found a number of operations by men under McCaffrey's command that are, at a minimum, unsettling. His detailed account, published here this week, describes how, on March 2, 1991 - two days after the declaration of a ceasefire, when Iraqi forces were in flight, McCaffrey attacked a line of retreating Iraqi vehicles and troops, unleashing an assault that lasted several hours and was all but uncontested. In testimony before the Senate and in written answers to questions from Hersh (whose repeated <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> were declined), McCaffrey said that his men were fired on and {{he had no choice but}} to respond in force-with the full might of his division." ...|$|R

On the strength of that you will order him to be shewn in; and the moment you see him you will feel angry with your servant for deceiving you completely as to the sort of man you were to expect by using the word gentleman in what you call its true sense. Or reverse the case. Suppose the caller is your cousin, Mr. Marmaduke Lind, and your high-principled servant by mistaking the name or how not, causes you to ask the same question with respect to him. The answer will be that Mr. Marmaduke--being a scamp--is not a gentleman. You would be just as completely deceived as in the other case. No, Mr. Lind, you might as well say that this workman of mine is a true lord or a true prince as a true gentleman.

Walters merely followed up with the question, [...] "What kind of a tree?", and Hepburn responded [...] "an oak" [...] because they are strong and pretty. According to Walters, for years Hepburn refused her <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview.</b> And when she finally agreed to one, she said she wanted to meet her first. Walters walked in all smiles and ready to please, while Hepburn {{was at the top of}} the stairs and barked, [...] "You're late. Have you brought me chocolates?" [...] Walters hadn't, but said she never showed up without them from then on. They had several other meetings since that first time, mostly in Hepburn's living room where she would give Walters her opinions. Careers and marriage did not mix. Children and careers were out of the question. Walters said Hepburn's opinions stuck with her so much, she could repeat them almost verbatim to this day.|$|R

6000|$|His purpose {{had been}} to see Chad the next day, and he had prefigured seeing him by an early call; having in general never stood on {{ceremony}} in respect to visits at the Boulevard Malesherbes. It had been more often natural {{for him to go}} there than for Chad to come to the small hotel, the attractions of which were scant; yet it nevertheless, just now, at the eleventh hour, did suggest itself to Strether to begin by giving the young man a chance. It struck him that, in the inevitable course, Chad would be [...] "round," [...] as Waymarsh used to say--Waymarsh who already, somehow, seemed long ago. He hadn't come the day before, because it had been arranged between them that Madame de Vionnet should see their friend first; but now that this passage had taken place he would present himself, and their friend wouldn't have long to wait. Strether assumed, he became aware, on this reasoning, that the interesting parties to the arrangement would have met betimes, and that the more interesting of the two--as she was after all--would have communicated to the other the issue of her appeal. Chad would know without delay that his mother's messenger had been with her, and, though it was perhaps not quite easy to see how she could qualify what had occurred, he would at least have been sufficiently advised to feel he could go on. The day, however, brought, early or late, no word from him, and Strether felt, as a result of this, that a change had practically come over their intercourse. It was perhaps a premature judgement; or it only meant perhaps--how could he tell?--that the wonderful pair he protected had taken up again together the excursion he had accidentally checked. They might have gone back to the country, and gone back but with a long breath drawn; that indeed would best mark Chad's sense that reprobation hadn't rewarded Madame de Vionnet's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview.</b> At the end of the twenty-four hours, {{at the end of the}} forty-eight, there was still no overture; so that Strether filled up the time, as he had so often filled it before, by going to see Miss Gostrey.|$|E

I have been obliged to watch carefully his remarks upon the Jews. He will frequently err in good judgement, and this error will take the shape of excerpts from newspapers as proof of serious statements, unwise generalisations and, where Jews are concerned, remarks capable of rousing the ignorant or malevolent.
