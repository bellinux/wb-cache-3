40|$|AbstractSingle-flank and double-flank <b>rolling</b> <b>tests</b> are {{functional}} verifications {{to obtain}} representative {{parameters of the}} future gear behavior under operating conditions. The reliability of the results are questioned due to the great number of error sources together {{with a lack of}} norms that could provide a standard traceability procedure.

In this work, the development of an equipment which combines single-flank and double-flank <b>rolling</b> <b>tests</b> for worm-worm gear is presented.

Most methods optimize a single objective: for instance, {{the amount of}} information in a test, subject to a number of constraints. However, some <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> problems have multiple objectives. A recent example in the literature is the problem of assembling test that measure multiple traits, where {{the amount of information}} in the test about each different trait has to be maximized. The present paper proposes methods appropriate for solving multiple objective <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> problems. An overview of multiple objective optimization methods is given. The impact of the method on the optimality of the solution is shown and the appropriateness of the methods is discussed. The methods are illustrated using an empirical example of a <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> problem for a two-dimensional mathematics item pool...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{automatically}} selecting items {{for inclusion in}} a test that has constraints on item content and statistical properties was applied to real data. Two tests were assembled by test specialists who assemble such tests on a routine basis. Using the same pool of items and the same constraints, the two tests were reassembled auto-matically. Test specialists {{not involved in the}} original manual <b>assembly</b> compared the <b>tests</b> constructed manually to the tests constructed automatically. The results indicated that the progress of automated <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> methods lies in improving item banking systems, classification schemes, and quality control measures, rather than in the development of different algorithms or in the improvement of computer time and cost. Index terms: heuristic algorithms, mathe-matical programming, <b>test</b> <b>assembly,</b> <b>test</b> construction, test design. The process of test construction is time consuming and expensive. Every year public and private testing organizations spend millions of dollars writing and editing items and then assembling these items into test forms for some measurement purpose. Until recently, the process of test construction or <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> has been virtually unassisted by modern psychometrics. A practical application of item response theory (IRT) suggested by Lord (1980) and Birnbaum (1968) is to use IRT in the <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> process. But the <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> process they suggested has little or no practical (as opposed to measurement) advantage over <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> methods using conventional statistics without additional assistance from computers. In the last 10 years, many <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> paradigms employing a combination of IRT, computers, and mathematical programming methods or heuristic methods have been proposed (e. g., Ackerman, 1989; Adema, 1988; Baker, Cohen, & Bar...|$|R

40|$|IRT {{parameters}} {{have to be}} estimated, {{and because}} of the estimation process, they do have uncertainty in them. In most large scale testing programs, the parameters are stored in item banks, and automated <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> algorithms are applied to assemble operational test forms. These algorithms treat item parameters as fixed values, and uncertainty is not taken into account. As a consequence, resulting tests might be off target or less informative than expected. In this paper, the process of parameter estimation is described to provide insight into the causes of uncertainty in the item parameters. The consequences of uncertainty are studied. Besides, an alternative automated <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> algorithm is presented that is robust against uncertainties in the data. Several numerical examples demonstrate the performance of the robust <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> algorithm, and illustrate the dangers of not taking this uncertainty into account. Finally, some recommendations about the use of robust <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> and some directions for further research are given. ...|$|R

40|$|The James Webb Space Telescope Instrument Support Integration Module (ISIM) {{is being}} {{designed}} and {{developed at the}} Goddard Space Flight Center. The ISM Thermal Distortion Testing (ITDT) program was started with the primary objective to validate the ISM mechanical design process. The ITDT effort seeks to establish confidence and demonstrate the ability to predict thermal distortion in composite structures at cryogenic temperatures using solid element models. This-program's goal is to better ensure that ISIM meets all the mechanical and structural requirements by using test results to verify or improve structural modeling techniques. The first step to accomplish the ITDT objectives was to design, and then construct solid element models of a series 2 -D <b>test</b> <b>assemblies</b> that represent critical building blocks of the ISIM structure. Second, the actual <b>test</b> <b>assemblies</b> consisting of composite tubes and invar end fittings were fabricated and tested for thermal distortion. This paper presents {{the development of the}} GSFC Cryo Distortion Measurement Facility (CDMF) to meet the requirements of the ISIM 2 -D <b>test.</b> <b>assemblies,</b> and other future ISIM testing needs. The CDMF provides efficient cooling with both a single, and two-stage cryo-cooler. Temperature uniformity of the <b>test</b> <b>assemblies</b> during thermal transients and at steady state is accomplished by using sapphire windows for all of the optical ports on the radiation shields and by using. thermal straps to cool the <b>test</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Numerical thermal models of the <b>test</b> <b>assemblies</b> were used to predict the temperature uniformity of the parts during cooldown and at steady state. Results of these models are compared to actual temperature data from the tests. Temperature sensors with a 0. 25 K precision were used to insure that <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> gradients did not exceed 2 K lateral, and 4 K axially. The thermal distortions of two assemblies were measured during six thermal cycles from 320 K to 35 K using laser interferometers. The standard deviation for all of the distortion measurements is less than 0. 5 microns, which falls within the ISIM requirement of 3 microns...|$|R

Low-voltage {{switchgear}} and controlgear assemblies with a rated short-circuit withstand strength above 10 kA, are required, by law, {{to conform}} to the South African standard, SANS 1473 - 1 (Low Voltage Switchgear and Controlgear Assemblies: Part 1 : Typetested, partially type-tested and specially <b>tested</b> <b>assemblies</b> with rated short-circuit withstand strength above lOkA). Standard SANS 1473 - 1 stipulates three categories of assemblies i. e. type-tested, partially type-tested and specially <b>tested</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The specially <b>tested</b> <b>assembly</b> is unique to the South African market, while the other two categories are stipulated in standard SANS IEC 60439 - 1 (Low Voltage Switchgear and Controlgear Assemblies: Part 1 : Type-tested and partially type-tested assemblies), which is internationally accepted in many countries as the applicable low-voltage assembly standard. Standard SANS 1473 - 1 specifies seven type-tests for certification as a type-tested assembly (TTA), but specifies, at most, three type-tests for certification as a specially <b>tested</b> <b>assembly</b> (STA). The underlying purpose of a technical standard is to provide for the safety of people and property, with the purpose of the research being twofold: 1. To investigate if the testing requirements specified for a specially <b>tested</b> <b>assembly</b> (STA), in accordance with standard SANS 1473 - 1, are correctly applied, and do not pose any safety risks. 2. To investigate any safety risks that stem from the fact that four type-tests are excluded for verification as a specially <b>tested</b> <b>assembly</b> (STA), as opposed to the seven type tests required for verification as a type-tested assembly (TTA).

40|$|In many high-stakes testing programs, testlets {{are used}} to {{increase}} efficiency. Since responses to items belonging to the same testlet not only depend on the latent ability but also on correct reading, understanding, and interpretation of the stimulus, the assumption of local independence does not hold. Testlet response theory (TRT) models {{have been developed to}} deal with this dependency. For both logit and probit testlet models, a random testlet effect is added to the standard logit and probit item response theory (IRT) models. Even though this testlet effect might make the IRT models more realistic, application of these models in practice leads to new questions, for example, in automated <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> (ATA). In many <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> models, goals have been formulated for the amount of information the test should provide about the candidates. The amount of Fisher Information is often maximized or it has to meet a prespecified target. Since TRT models have a random testlet effect, Fisher Information contains a random effect as well.

40|$|It {{is quite}} common that tests or exams are being used for more then one purpose. First of all, {{they are used to}} measure the ability of the {{students}} in a reliable manner. Besides, they can be used for pass/fail decisions or to predict future behavior of the candidate, like future job behavior or academic performance. The question remains how to assemble a test {{that can be used for}} all these different purposes, that is, how to assemble a multi-objective test. Besides, multiple objectives can result from different purposes, but also from the way test specifications have been implemented.
