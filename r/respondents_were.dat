50|$|For example, say the 5 prices chosen are $1, $2, $3, $4 and $5. A first random chosen price {{might be}} $4. If the <b>respondent</b> <b>is</b> in top 2 on {{purchase}} intent, {{then there is}} only $5 left higher so the <b>respondent</b> <b>is</b> asked purchase intent at that price. If they are in top 2 on $5 then the <b>respondent</b> <b>is</b> coded $5 as this is the highest price they are in top 2 to pay. If {{they are not in}} top 2 on $5 then the <b>respondent</b> <b>is</b> coded as $4 as this was the highest price they are willing to pay.

5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and <b>respondents</b> <b>were</b> asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that <b>respondents</b> <b>were</b> more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E

5|$|An EKOS poll {{conducted}} in December 2009 revealed that 83% {{of the respondents}} believed the government knew Afghan detainees were tortured.

5|$|Polling {{has shown}} a modest rise in support for NATO {{membership}} among Swedes since 2008 according to Ipsos polling, going from 22 percent in May 2008 to 33 percent in January 2015, with another from the SOM Institute in May 2015 showing similar numbers. According to Svenska Dagbladet, support in 2011 was at 23 percent, and has risen somewhat significantly to 41 percent in September 2015, when only 39 percent of <b>respondents</b> <b>were</b> opposed to NATO membership. An October 2014 survey commissioned by TV4 News also showed slightly more respondents supporting membership than opposing it. In 2014, news that a military expert in Sweden had calculated that the country could hold out for a week if attacked temporarily lifted support for NATO membership in polls.

5|$|A {{survey in}} 2012 {{revealed}} that passengers who used Metrolink everyday for commuting rated service levels as poor and/or unreliable, with those respondents particularly frustrated by delays and disruptions.

Among those who used Metrolink less regularly, the system scored far better in the survey. A survey in 2013 by the non-departmental government body Passenger Focus found that of the five major light rail systems in the United Kingdom – Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, NET, Midland Metro and Blackpool tramway – Metrolink had the lowest overall satisfaction rating in the United Kingdom. <b>Respondents</b> <b>were</b> surveyed on value for money, punctuality, seating availability, tram stops and overall satisfaction.

5|$|Seen {{as likely}} to provoke {{controversy}} even before its publication, Sexual Preference received considerable media attention, and reviews that were mainly mixed or negative. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed {{for use in the}} biological sciences, called path analysis, disputed the representativeness of their sample of homosexuals, pointed out the difficulty and potential unreliability of adult recall of childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions <b>respondents</b> <b>were</b> asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that sexual orientation is innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented Sexual Preference for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It {{is one of the most}} frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation, credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality. In 2009, the American Psychological Association credited Bell et al. with helping to discredit theories attributing sexual orientation to family dynamics or trauma.|$|E

40|$|Mobbing and bossing is {{currently}} still more topical issue {{and not only}} in helping professions. Areas such as health service and social work are assessed as high-risk areas.

The survey showed that the employees working in the helping professions have some experience with mobbing and bossing. The most common signs of mobbing were: spread of false information and lies about the respondent; complaining to the manager about the respondent; the respondents often think about the person also outside the workplace, the <b>respondent</b> <b>is</b> gradually ignored by the employees who formerly talked to him/her; all the mistakes made by the <b>respondent</b> <b>were</b> exaggerated; the <b>respondent</b> <b>was</b> ignored and set apart from the collective; the <b>respondent</b> <b>was</b> not invited to the social events where the other employees were invited or such events were kept apart from him/her; the work of the <b>respondent</b> <b>was</b> constantly monitored and its correctness <b>was</b> questioned; the <b>respondent</b> a target of constant ridicules and innuendos (clothes, handicap?); the other employees were leaving the room where the respondent stayed; when the respondent joined the collective, the others stopped talking; the education and qualification of the <b>respondent</b> <b>was</b> questioned; the <b>respondent</b> <b>was</b> blamed for any unsatisfactory work in the workplace; the colleagues sent meaningless messages and information to the respondent; during the absence of the respondent happened significant changed in the workplace; the things of the respondent kept losing in the workplace, the <b>respondent</b> <b>was</b> constantly moved into some other office; the <b>respondent</b> <b>was</b> treated with contemptuous gestures and jeers; the respondent attacked by the other employees; the religion, nationality or political ideas of the <b>respondent</b> <b>were</b> criticized or the <b>respondent</b> <b>was</b> addressed by an abusive nickname.
