5|$|Seeing all the singers, you <b>really</b> <b>come</b> face to {{face with}} a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
25|$|His {{technique}} is awesome! Even today, nobody has <b>really</b> <b>come</b> {{to the state}} that he was playing at. As good as players are, they haven’t gotten to where he is. There's {{a lot of guys}} that play fast and a lot of guys that play clean, and the guitar {{has come a long way}} as far as speed and clarity go, but nobody plays with the whole fullness of expression that Django has. I mean, the combination of incredible speed – all the speed you could possibly want – but also the thing of every note have a specific personality. You don’t hear it. I really haven’t heard it anywhere but with Django.|$|E

500|$|J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{the author}} of , called the song, along with [...] "You'll See", as one of [...] "the most sombre songs [...] has ever recorded." [...] Tirzah Agassi from The Jerusalem Post felt the song is [...] "much more shallow" [...] than [...] "You'll See". Adam Graham from The Detroit News called the song [...] "a sparse {{acoustic}} ballad" [...] on which Madonna warmed up her pre-Evita pipes. Writing for the website TheBacklot.com in 2012, Louis Virtel ranked the song at number 84 on [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs", saying that the song is [...] "nothing more than a guitar and Madonna's torch-song trilling, and it's more effective than anything you've heard out of Taylor Swift's mouth {{in the past five}} years". Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna was critical of the song. He panned the lyrics, saying they were [...] "bland" [...] and felt that Madonna's singing [...] "lacked confidence and improvisation needed to make this kind of [...] <b>really</b> <b>come</b> alive".|$|E
500|$|During the {{subsequent}} media coverage, {{the game was}} removed from shelves by some vendors, including both UK and international branches of Game and Dixons. Rockstar responded to this move by stating, [...] "we have always appreciated Dixons as a retail partner, and we fully respect their actions. We are naturally very surprised and disappointed that any retailer would choose to pull any game ... We reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of Manhunt." [...] Rockstar also reiterated that the game was intended for adults only; [...] "Rockstar Games is a leading publisher of interactive entertainment geared towards mature audiences, and [...] markets its games responsibly, targeting advertising and marketing only to adult consumers ages 18 and older." [...] As the media speculated that the game could be banned completely, there was a [...] "significantly increased" [...] demand for it both from retailers and on Internet auction sites. Giselle Pakeerah responded to this by saying [...] "it doesn't <b>really</b> <b>come</b> as surprise, they say no publicity is bad publicity. But I must say I'm saddened and disappointed. The content of this game is contemptible. It's a societal hazard and my concern is to get it off the shelves as there's enough violence in society already." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{discussed}} the idea {{with other members}} of the writing staff; they focused on the incident which caused Picard to require an artificial heart. It had previously been mentioned in the episodes [...] "Samaritan Snare" [...] and [...] "Final Mission". They compared Picard to Captain James T. Kirk, describing them as opposites in terms of development. They saw Picard being a wildchild during his time at Starfleet Academy, only to become more serious later. The reverse for true for Kirk, with the staff describing him as a [...] "bookworm" [...] while at the Academy and only becoming [...] "crazy" [...] once posted to a starship. Together, they sought for a way to support Picard's claim in [...] "Samaritan Snare" [...] that he laughed when he was stabbed. Story editor René Echevarria said that [...] "It made us all think we had <b>really</b> <b>come</b> up with the right story for the premise and tying that together, I think it's one of the finest efforts ever." [...] While Moore called the episode [...] "A Q Carol" [...] based on the original premise, but Piller was the one to suggest [...] "Tapestry" [...] as he said [...] "you have to learn to set your part of the tapestry of your life".|$|E

Chaney thought the [...] "quick edits actually gave the song a nice energy, but also prevented us from seeing more of Tina and Mike dancing", which she said [...] "was a shame". Flandez and Lynch both praised Mike's singing; Lynch said his [...] "voice sounded great", and Flandez declared that [...] "Mike has <b>really</b> <b>come</b> into his own as a singer". For [...] "Let Me Love You", Lynch wrote that [...] "Artie busted out some serious sex appeal" [...] and gave the [...] "spot-on smooth" [...] performance a [...] "B+".

500|$|Several critics {{praised the}} {{development}} of Santana. Hankinson wrote, [...] "My goodness, Santana. It's {{as if all the}} writers sat around a room, identified the best lines of tonight's episode and then decided to give them all to Santana. Fantastic." [...] VanDerWerff called Santana the highlight of the episode: [...] "The best thing about this episode is Naya Rivera's work as Santana and the story the three writers have cooked up for her. Rivera's <b>really</b> <b>come</b> into her own this season, going from just a generic bitchy cheerleader to an actual character who has motivations and might be a better villain for the show than Sue." [...] He added, [...] "the storyline of Santana realizing {{she was in love with}} Brittany and, thus, is probably a lesbian has been nicely plotted and surprisingly deep. The reveal about Santana hasn't washed away her less savory qualities; indeed, it's heightened them, to a degree, as she struggles to be true to herself and still maintain her status as the hottest girl in school." [...] Jenna Mullins of E! Online wrote of Santana, [...] "This episode just cemented my love for her. The insult spew in the beginning of the episode was awesomely mean." [...] She also said that Santana's [...] "inner monologue is often more entertaining than other characters' outer monologues". CNN Lisa Respers France considered Santana the episode's highlight, and went on to write, [...] "She embraced her inner lesbian (sort of) and rattled off the best [...] like 'the only straight I am is straight-up [...]' You gotta love that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1966 New York Herald Tribune feature by {{his former}} office manager-turned-journalist, Marilyn Mercer wrote, [...] "Ebony never drew {{criticism}} from Negro groups (in fact, Eisner was commended by some for using him), perhaps because, although his speech pattern was early Minstrel Show, he himself derived from another literary tradition: {{he was a}} combination of Tom Sawyer and Penrod, with a touch of Horatio Alger hero, and color didn't <b>really</b> <b>come</b> into it".|$|E

2500|$|After making {{two more}} films of social {{relevance}} (Ningen in 1962 and Mother in 1963), Shindo shifted his focus as a filmmaker to the individuality of a person, specifically a person's sexual nature.

2500|$|A driverless tractor [...] {{is a form}} of {{autonomous}} technology. It is considered driverless because it operates without the presence of a human inside the tractor itself. Like other unmanned ground vehicles, they are programmed to independently observe their position, decide speed and avoid obstacles such as people, animals or objects in the field, while performing their task. The various driverless tractors are split into full autonomous technology and supervised autonomy. The idea of the driverless tractor appears as early as 1940, but has <b>really</b> <b>come</b> to fruition in the last few years. The tractors use GPS and other wireless technologies to farm land without the need of a driver.
