5|$|A Momentary Lapse of <b>Reason</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in the UK and US on 7September 1987. It went straight to number three in both countries, held from the top spot by Michael Jackson's Bad and Whitesnake's self-titled album.|$|E
5|$|Ministers in the Madras {{government}} and ruling party members supported the strike. On 29 August 1921, the police opened fire and killed {{six of the}} workers on the spot. Top Justice Party leaders like O. Thanikachalam Chetti severely censured the police for the measures they adopted. The main <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> that the police was {{under the control of}} the governor and the government was looking for an opportunity to harass the executive. Another probable <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> that the striking workers had the caste sympathies of the Justice Party government whose ministers and chief whips were caste Hindus like themselves.|$|E
5|$|A Momentary Lapse of <b>Reason</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} {{primarily on}} Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria. Its production {{was marked by}} an ongoing legal dispute with Waters as to who owned the rights to Pink Floyd's name, an issue resolved several months after the album was released. Unlike many of Pink Floyd's studio albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason has no central theme and is instead a collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters.|$|E

Section 2 gives two concrete {{examples of how}} our topic directly affects the internalism/externalism debate in normative epistemology. Section 3 responds to an argument against the view that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> mental states. Section 4 presents two problems for the view that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> propositions. Section 5 presents two problems for the view that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> non-mental facts. Section 6 argues that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> mental states. Section 7 responds to objections. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Are {{reasons for}} action facts or {{psychological}} states? There are two answers {{in the literature}} on the ontology of reasons. According to the Standard Story, normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> facts, while motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> psychological states. According to the factualist, both normative and motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> facts. In this paper I argue that neither of these views is satisfactory. The Standard Story errs in thinking that the two kinds of <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> different ontological entities. The factualist gets this right, but incurs some distasteful ontological commitments by thinking of motivating reasons as facts. We should, thus, give a proper hearing to the only serious logically possible alternative to the two existing views: both motivating and normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> psychological states...|$|R
5|$|A: Rules at {{the time}} of the first three ceremonies allowed for a {{performer}} to receive a single nomination which could honor their work in more than one film. Greta Garbo and Norma Shearer were both nominated for two different roles in the same category. Current Academy rules forbid this from happening. No official <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> ever given as to why Shearer won the award for only one of the two films she was listed for.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Maxentius in 312, Constantine disbanded the Praetorian Guard, {{ending the}} latter's 300-year existence. Although the instant <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> the Guard's {{support for his}} rival Maxentius, a force based in Rome had also become obsolete since emperors now rarely resided there. The imperial escort role of the Guard's cavalry, the equites singulares Augusti, was now fulfilled by the scholae. These elite cavalry regiments existed {{by the time of}} Constantine and may have been founded by Diocletian.|$|E
5|$|Around 1779 Priestley and Shelburne had a rupture, {{the precise}} reasons for which remain unclear. Shelburne blamed Priestley's health, while Priestley claimed Shelburne had no further use for him. Some contemporaries speculated that Priestley's {{outspokenness}} had hurt Shelburne's political career. Schofield {{argues that the}} most likely <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> Shelburne's recent marriage to Louisa Fitzpatrick—apparently, {{she did not like}} the Priestleys. Although Priestley considered moving to America, he eventually accepted Birmingham New Meeting's offer to be their minister.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I give a novel {{argument}} for the view that epistemic normative reasons (or evidence) need not be facts. I first argue {{that the nature of}} normative <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> uniform, such that our positions about the factivity of reasons should agree across normative realms –– whether epistemic, moral, practical, or otherwise. With that in mind, I proceed in a somewhat indirect way. I argue that if practical motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> not factive, then practical normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> not factive. If it is possible to act rationally in the light of a falsehood, as I will say, then some good <b>reasons</b> must <b>be</b> falsehoods. The implication of this argument is perhaps surprising: for one to firmly establish the view that epistemic normative <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> factive, one must discredit the view that practical motivating <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> not factive...|$|R

40|$|To explain an {{intentional}} action one must exhibit the agent’s reasons. Donald Davidson famously {{argued that the}} only clear way to understand action explanation is to hold that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes. Davidson’s discussion conflated two issues: whether <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes and whether reasons causally explain intentional action. Contemporary work on explanation and normativity help disentangle these issues and ground an argument that intentional action explanations cannot be a species of causal explanation. Interestingly, this conclusion is consistent with Davidson’s conclusion that <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes. In other words, <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> causes, but rationalizing explanations are not causal explanations...|$|R

5|$|On a rainy Sunday of 1951, {{the crowd}} left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and {{surprising}} the Francoist authorities. The <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> simple: {{at the same}} time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent {{much more than just}} Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{headquarters}} {{decided to}} man the outer line of defences, the furthest from the densely populated areas. The <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> {{that in the}} 1830s 53 percent of buildings (out of 3,148 houses in Warsaw) were made of wood and a fire could easily destroy the city. In case the enemy broke through all three lines of defences, the city centre was also fortified with 30 barricades, embrasures cut through the walls of several buildings and mines hidden beneath major street crossings.|$|E

A couple of <b>reasons</b> <b>were</b> cited for the decline.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} eight <b>reasons</b> why it <b>is</b> rational not {{to trust}} large complex Anglo corpora-tions {{and how these}} <b>reasons</b> could <b>be</b> removed. Two <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> that directors are overloaded with information but also lack information independent of management to evaluate manage-ment and the business. A third <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that directors do not have systemic processes to dis-cover if their trust in management is misplaced. A fourth and fifth <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that directors have absolute power to manage their own conflicts of interest and a dominant shareholder can enter into related party transactions that can unfairly extract value. The sixth and seventh <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> the incentive for directors not {{to blow the whistle}} on their colleagues and the impotence of a director to act alone. The eighth <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that shares can be manipulated and traded cov-ertly. Four changes in corporate constitutions are identified that could remove these concerns. These are to establish a watchdog board, introduce cumulative voting for directors, establish stakeholder councils and introducing sunlight share trading...|$|R
5|$|The Young Turks and Khánh {{wanted to}} {{forcibly}} retire officers {{with more than}} 25 years of service, ostensibly because they thought them to be lethargic, out of touch, and ineffective. However, the unspoken and most important <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> because they viewed the older generals as rivals for power. Specific targets of this proposed policy were Minh and other senior officers in his short-lived junta, Trần Văn Đôn, Lê Văn Kim and Mai Hữu Xuân.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} within the sangha, Koṇḍañña retired to the Himalayas {{for the last}} twelve years of his life. This is {{attributed}} to two reasons in Buddhist literature. The first <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> that Koṇḍañña considered his presence {{to be a source}} of inconvenience for Sariputra and Moggallana, the two chief disciples of The Buddha. As the seniormost member of the sangha, Koṇḍañña lead the monks on the alms-round, but during dharma talks, the two chief disciples sat on either side of the Buddha and Koṇḍañña behind them. The two chief disciples were uncomfortable sitting in front of Koṇḍañña, so he decided to solve the problem by absenting himself. The other reason to which Koṇḍañña's leave is attributed was to spend more quiet time in religious practice, which was rendered difficult due to the attention that the sangha gained from the public.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to the proximity to the entrance of Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships. Another <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> that mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev {{conspired to}} oust Podgorny from the {{collective}} leadership {{as early as}} 1970. The <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> simple: Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet diplomatic protocol; Podgorny's removal would have made Brezhnev head of state, and his political power would have increased significantly. For much of the period, however, Brezhnev was unable to have Podgorny removed, {{because he could not}} count on enough votes in the Politburo, since the removal of Podgorny would have meant weakening of the power and the prestige of the collective leadership itself. Indeed, Podgorny continued to acquire greater power as the head of state throughout the early 1970s, due to Brezhnev's liberal stance on Yugoslavia and his disarmament talks with some Western powers, policies which many Soviet officials saw as contrary to common communist principles.|$|E
5|$|But {{the real}} <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> that the {{production}} had financial issues, with {{the acquisition of}} new crew members {{and the increase in}} popularity of Doctor Leonard McCoy meaning that those salaries needed {{to come out of the}} original budget. In Justman and Herb Solow's 1996 book Inside Star Trek, they stated that following a discussion between Roddenberry, Solow and Bernie Weitzman in which they discussed her contract, they decided to terminate it because of Whitney's limited appearances and the financial issues that the series was having. The decision was attributed elsewhere in David Alexander's 1995 authorized biography of Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek Creator, which said that during the first batch of episodes, casting director Joseph D'Agosta reviewed the contracts for the main actors due to rising costs.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{returned}} to Leeds City from Barnbow after hostilities had ended, but resigned suddenly in December 1918, eventually moving to Selby {{to take up}} a position as a superintendent at an oil and coke works. No <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> given for his resignation, but as football resumed in 1919–20, Leeds City were accused by a former player of financial irregularities, involving illegal payments to guest players during wartime matches. No documentary evidence was produced, but Leeds' refusal to allow the authorities access to their financial records was deemed a sign of guilt, and they were expelled from the Football League in October 1919 and five club officials, including Chapman, were banned from football for life. The club was dissolved, with the players auctioned off and their Elland Road ground taken over by the newly formed Leeds United.|$|E

40|$|How <b>are</b> <b>reasons</b> and {{evidence}} interrelated?

In this paper, I argue against these common views, and I defend the view that <b>reasons</b> and evidence <b>are</b> conjunctively related: evidence and <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> distinguishable yet inseparable. I argue <b>reasons</b> and evidence <b>are</b> distinct because they come apart in certain cases, and I argue <b>reasons</b> and evidence <b>are</b> inseparable because only when properly conjoined are they capable of yielding correct verdicts on important cases in epistemology...|$|R

5|$|Content {{with their}} convincing win at Trent Bridge, Australia made no changes to their team, while England made three, omitting Barnett, Hardstaff and Young {{due to a}} {{combination}} of injury and poor form. Barnett and Hardstaff never played another Test. Despite his injury, Lindwall {{played a key role in}} a heavy 409-run Australian victory, taking eight wickets. His bowling also led to the controversial omission of Hutton, who performed poorly at Lord's, for the Third Test. The <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. This decision pleased the Australians, who regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent with the bat.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige, the {{archbishop}} of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected Archbishop of York on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, {{and it appears that}} Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several of his predecessors had done. There were a few reasons for this, one of which was political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. Another <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed {{the archbishop}} sufficient revenue to support himself.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn Féin movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.|$|E
