60|$|Between the two {{examples}} {{which we have}} here given, {{there is a difference}} worth pointing out. In the former (in which the phenomenon produced is a substance, and not a motion of a substance), since the rust remains forever and unaltered unless some new cause supervenes, we may speak of the contact of air a hundred years ago as even the proximate cause of the rust which has existed from that time until now. But when the effect is motion, which is itself a change, we must use a different language. The permanency of the effect is now only the permanency of a series of changes. The second foot, or inch, or mile of motion is not the mere prolonged duration of the first foot, or inch, or mile, but another fact which succeeds, and which may in some respects be very unlike the former, since it carries the body through a different region of space. Now, the original projectile force which set the body moving is the remote cause of all its motion, however long continued, but the proximate cause of no motion except that which took place at the first instant. The motion at any subsequent instant is proximately caused by the motion which took place at the instant preceding. It is on that, and not on the original moving cause, that the motion at any given moment depends. For, suppose that the body passes through some resisting medium, which partially counteracts the effect of the original impulse, and retards the motion; this counteraction (it need scarcely here be repeated) is as strict an example of obedience to the law of the impulse, as if the body had gone on moving with its original velocity; but the motion which results is different, being now a compound of the effects of two causes acting in contrary directions, instead of the single effect of one cause. Now, what cause does the body obey in its subsequent motion? The original cause of motion, or the actual motion at the preceding instant? The latter; for when the object issues from the resisting medium, it continues moving, not with its original, but with its <b>retarded</b> <b>velocity.</b> The motion having once been diminished, all that which follows is diminished. The effect changes, because the cause which it really obeys, the proximate cause, the real cause in fact, has changed. This principle is recognized by mathematicians when they enumerate among the causes by which the motion of a body is at any instant determined the force generated by the previous motion; an expression which would be absurd if taken to imply that this “force” was an intermediate link between the cause and the effect, but which really means only the previous motion itself, considered as a cause of further motion. We must, therefore, if we would speak with perfect precision, consider each link in the succession of motions as the effect of the link preceding it. But if, for the convenience of discourse, we speak of the whole series as one effect, it must be as an effect produced by the original impelling force; a permanent effect produced by an instantaneous cause, and possessing the property of self-perpetuation.|$|E

[...] The laminar boundary-layer equation, for a linearly <b>retarded</b> <b>velocity</b> in {{the main}} stream, U = 1 [...] }x ill reduced variables, has been solved numerically by working in finite {{intervals}} in x, with a correction for the finite length of x-interval.

The separation point has been determined by two independent methods {{to be close to}} x = 0. 959, in excellent agreement with Howarth's value. The nature of the singularity at the separation point is discussed. 1. Introduction. [...] -The equations of the laminar boundary layer, in their usual form, are partial differential equations in two variables, and though in a few special cases the variables can be separated, this is not possible in general.

CH/CH 2 O/OH, HCO/CH 2 O/OH and T/CH 2 O/OH, and laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) measurements are carried out to characterize the flame/turbulence interaction in various regimes of turbulent combustion, including the laminar flamelet regime, the thin reaction zone (TRZ) regime, and the distributed reaction zone (DRZ) regime. A series of turbulent pre-mixed methane/air jet flames with different jet speeds and equivalence ratios are studied. The jet Reynolds number ranges from 6000 to 40, 000 and the Karlovitz number (Ka) of the studied flames varies from 25 to 1470. It is shown that in the TRZ regime CH/HCO layer remain thin but the layer of CH 2 O and temperature gradient are broadened owing to the rapid turbulence transport. In the DRZ regime the CH and HCO layers are also broadened owing to the rapid transport of reactive species such as OH radicals from the high temperature regions where these radicals are formed to the low temperature region. In the DRZ regime CH and HCO are found to coexist with OH or CH 2 O owing to the rapid turbulence eddy interaction, which differs fundamentally from that in the TRZ regime and the laminar flamelet regime. For the present investigated flames, the temperature range for the distributed reaction to occur is found to be between 1100 K and 1500 K. It is shown that the structures of flames in different regimes can affect the turbulence field differently. In the DRZ regime the temperature gradient is lower than that in the laminar flamelet and the TRZ regimes, which results in a lower peak of turbulence intensity owing to the <b>retarded</b> <b>velocity</b> gradient across the flames and thereby a lower rate of turbulence production...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the variation of retardation factor and velocity of a lithium (a nonlinearly sorbing solute) plume {{in relation to the}} variation of lithium concentration in the plume by using field-measured breakthrough curves (BTCs). A concentration-dependent/time-dependent retardation factor (R-c) and a cell-averaged retardation factor ((R) over bar) (please see Section 2. 1 for definitions) of the lithium plume were derived from the BTCs. The concentration-dependent retardation factor, R., is initially large at low concentration of the lithium plume, and it drops steadily with the increasing concentration to a minimum value at the highest concentration of the plume. After the peak concentration has passed away, R-c increases gradually with the decreasing concentration of the plume. The cell-averaged retardation factor, (R) over bar, is close to a section of the concentration-dependent retardation factor, which is obtained at the few highest concentrations in a BTC. (R) over bar varies widely, especially at the low concentrations of the lithium plume, with the distribution coefficient K of lithium and exponent n of the Freundlich isotherm for lithium adsorption. Considerable variations in (R) over bar are also observed between the BTCs at different depths in a monitoring well. A single average retardation factor defined for a monitoring well is thus confounded with the variation of concentrations in the BTCs at different depths. The instantaneous velocity of the lithium plume, called the retarded velocity/local velocity (please see Section 2. 2 for definitions), changes with the concentration of the plume in an opposite way from the retardation factor. The <b>retarded</b> <b>velocity</b> is, of necessity, always lower than the constant velocity of the groundwater flow in the aquifer. A cell-averaged velocity of the lithium plume, derived from the cell-averaged retardation factor, is an average velocity of the plume at any point on the travel path for the entire breakthrough time of the plume. This velocity provides little information about the transport processes of lithium in the aquifer. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Emphasis is placed on a physically-based model of bank erosion, into which various kinds of bank {{protection}} can be imbedded. For simplicity, the study is restricted to straight channels. The methods developed here can, however, be applied to the broader context of meandering channels. The report consists of two parts. The first part is devoted to an experimental study of the problem. The process of bank erosion of coarse material is first studied. The channel is allowed to erode until such point as a stable equilibrium is attained. Such experiments provide a baseline against which to test the effectiveness of various means of bank protection. The type of bank protection studied falls under the category of distributed drag. Such methods use timber-pile permeable dikes, jacks, jetties, or trees in conjunction with the Palmiter method to slow the flow down {{in the vicinity of the}} bank. In the present study, screens similar to permeable dikes were used to accomplish this. It was shown that a sufficient density of distributed drag elements can substantially slow or stop bank erosion. When fine, suspendable material was added to the water, this material tended to settle out preferentially in the near-bank field of <b>retarded</b> <b>velocity</b> due to distributed drag. As a result, not only could bank erosion be prevented, but eroded banks could be reconstructed by means of deposition from suspension. The second part of the study was devoted to a theoretical and numerical model of bank erosion and its prevention, in parallel with the experiments. The theory is based on a description of bedload transport on side slopes up to the angle of repose. The Finite Element Method was used to model the flow and sediment transport field, as well as describe the time evolution of the channel. At present, the model has proved successful in describing the process of bank erosion documented in the experiments.

Gauteng Province (South Africa) has suffered immense problems related to sustainable rehabilitation of mine dumps. This is a huge challenge, as wastes are highly susceptible to both water and wind erosion. Establishing a grass cover to reduce erosion is the dominant reclamation method. Covering the slopes with biological geotextiles might constitute another option for mining companies to reduce erosion and aid natural re-vegetation. The objective of the waste part {{of this study was}} to determine the beneficial effect of palm mat cover on erosion control, using rainfall simulation. Results clearly illustrated that application of palm-mats more than halved the sediment load in runoff, thereby having the potential to effectively stabilize tailing dam slopes. Covering tailings with palm-mats did not reduce runoff or improve water infiltration, however. In São Luis City, biological geotextile mats were constructed from palm leaves which are an effective, sustainable and economically-viable soil conservation technique.

In this article, a new deterministic model is introduced which simulates the growth and movement of cyanobacterial blooms in river systems. The model focuses on the mathematical description of the bloom formation, vertical migration and lateral transport of colonies within river environments by {{taking into account the}} four major factors that affect the cyanobacterial bloom formation in freshwaters: light, nutrients, temperature and river flow. The model consists of two sub-models: a vertical migration model with respect to growth of cyanobacteria in relation to light, nutrients and temperature; and a hydraulic model to simulate the horizontal movement of the bloom. This article presents the model algorithms and highlights some important model results. The effects of nutrient limitation, varying illumination and river flow characteristics on cyanobacterial movement are simulated.

The effect of increasing Grashof number for heat and mass transfer or heat source parameter is to accelerate both mean and transient velocity of the flow field at all points. The mean velocity of the flow field increases with an increase in permeability parameter while the transient velocity increases for smaller values of Kp (≤ 1) and for higher values the effect reverses. A growing Hartmann number decreases the transient temperature of the flow field at all points while a growing permeability parameter or heat source parameter reverses the effect. The Prandtl number increases the transient temperature for small values of Pr (≤ 1) and for higher values the effect reverses. The effect of increasing Schmidt number is to reduce the concentration boundary layer thickness of the flow field at all points. The problem has some relevance in the geophysical and astrophysical studies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the mechanisms with which tip vortex cavitation {{is responsible for}} broadband pressure fluctuations on ship propellers. Hypotheses for these are described in detail by Bosschers (2009). Validation is provided by three main cavitation-tunnel experiments, one on a model propeller and two on a stationary wing. These {{have resulted in a}} model that can quantify the resonance frequency of a tip vortex cavity based on a limited number of propeller related parameters. Simultaneous measurement of sound and high-speed video recordings of propeller tip-vortex cavitation were performed, in the presence and absence of an upstream wake inflow. In uniform inflow no significant sound production was observed. For conditions of wake inflow a strong tonal sound was measured that decreases in frequency as the cavitation number decreases. In the frequency domain there was a 30 dB increase over a broadband range surrounding the tonal frequency. This tonal sound was directly related to the tip-vortex cavity-diameter oscillations downstream of the wake. The model described in chapter 2, based on a resonance frequency of a tip vortex cavity, accurately {{describes the}} dominant sound frequencies. The basis for the model are the dispersion relations of three deformation modes. The relations were found experimentally in the frequency and wave number domain of cavity-diameter fluctuations obtained from high-speed video on a fixed wing. Resonance of the tip vortex cavity occurs at zero group velocity of the volume variation mode (n= 0 -). This resonance frequency was obtained experimentally while a significant sound source was absent. The quantitative model input for the cavity angular velocity was the single fitted parameter and required validation. Validation was performed by measurement of the flow field of a tip vortex in presence as well as in absence of cavitation. This was achieved by stereo particle image velocimetry in combination with a correlation averaging method. It provided sufficient spatial resolution and accuracy, to show the effect of a tip vortex cavity on the flow field. The tip vortex cavity is surrounded by a region of <b>retarded</b> azimuthal <b>velocity,</b> similar to the viscous core of a vortex without cavitation. The tip-vortex cavity-resonance frequency is underestimated when the measured cavity angular velocity is used. This showed the limits of the dispersion relation model that is based on a potential flow vortex. An empirical closure was proposed to serve as input for the cavity angular velocity. A Proctor vortex model was used to describe the flow field of the tip vortex without cavitation. This model required the vortex circulation, the propeller diameter and an empirical roll-up parameter beta. This model was able to provide the cavity diameter as function of cavitation number. The angular velocity without cavitation at a radius equal to the cavity radius, was used as model input for the cavity angular velocity. This closure of the dispersion relation model was able to describe the dominant sound frequencies as found in the model propeller experiment in a wake inflow.

6000|$|... "On {{the other}} hand, I {{was aware that}} {{arguments}} have not been wanting to prove {{the existence of a}} real and definite limit to the atmosphere, beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever. But a circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit seemed to me, although no positive refutation of their creed, still a point worthy very serious investigation. On comparing the intervals between the successive arrivals of Encke's comet at its perihelion, after giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the disturbances due to the attractions of the planets, it appears that the periods are gradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis of the comet's ellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but perfectly regular decrease. Now, this is precisely what ought to be the case, if we suppose a resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the regions of its orbit. For it is evident that such a medium must, in <b>retarding</b> the comet's <b>velocity,</b> increase its centripetal, by weakening its centrifugal force. In other words, the sun's attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and the comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution. Indeed, {{there is no other way}} of accounting for the variation in question. But again. The real diameter of the same comet's nebulosity is observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion. Was I not justifiable in supposing with M. Valz, that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the same ethereal medium I have spoken of before, and which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity? The lenticular-shaped phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a matter worthy of attention. This radiance, so apparent in the tropics, and which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from the horizon obliquely upward, and follows generally the direction of the sun's equator. It appeared to me evidently in the nature of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the orbit of Venus at least, and I believed indefinitely farther.(*2) Indeed, this medium I could not suppose confined to the path of the comet's ellipse, or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun. It was easy, on the contrary, to imagine it pervading the entire regions of our planetary system, condensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves, and perhaps at some of them modified by considerations, so to speak, purely geological.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{available}} data {{with regard to the}} chemical and physical properties of the "substrate" luciferin (LH 2) and enzyme, luciferase (A), and of kinetic data derived both from the reaction in extracts of Cypridina, and from the luminescence of intact bacteria, the fundamental reactions involved in the phenomenon of bioluminescence have been schematized. These reactions provide a satisfactory basis for interpreting the known characteristics of the system, as well as the theoretical chemistry with regard to the control of its over-all velocity in relation to various factors. These factors, here studied experimentally wholly with bacteria, Photobacterium phosphoreum in particular, include pH, temperature, pressure, and the drugs sulfanilamide, urethane, and alcohol, separately and in relation to each other. Under steady state conditions of bacterial luminescence, with excess of oxidizable substrate and with oxygen not limiting, the data indicate that the chief effects of these agents center around the pace setting reactions, which may be designated by the equation: A + LH 2 → ALH 2 following which light emission is assumed proportional to the amount of the excited molecule, AL*. The relation between pH and luminescence intensity varies with (a), the buffer mixture and concentration, (b), the temperature, and (c), the hydrostatic pressure. At an optimum temperature for luminescence of about 22 ° C. in P. phosphoreum, the effects of increasing or decreasing the hydrogen ion concentration are largely reversible over the range between pH 3. 6 and pH 8. 8. The relation between luminescence intensity and pH, under the experimental conditions employed, is given by the following equation, in which I 1 represents the maximum intensity, occurring about pH 6. 5; I 2 the intensity at any other given pH; K 5 the equilibrium constant between hydrogen ions and the AL-; and K 6 the corresponding constant with respect to hydroxyl ions: See PDF for Equation The value of K 5, as indicated by the data, amounts to 4. 84 x 104, while that of K 6 amounts to 4. 8 x 105. Beyond the range between approximately pH 3. 8 and 8. 8, destructive effects of the hydrogen and hydroxyl ions, respectively, were increasingly apparent. By raising the temperature above the optimum, the destructive effects were apparent at all pH, and the intensity of the luminescence diminished logarithmically with time. With respect to pH, the rate of destruction of the light-emitting system at temperatures above the optimum was slowest between pH 6. 5 and 7. 0, and increased rapidly with more acid or more alkaline reactions of the medium. The reversible effects of slightly acid pH vary with the temperature in the manner of an inhibitor (Type I) that acts independently of the normal, reversible denaturation equilibrium (K 1) of the enzyme. The per cent inhibition caused by a given acid pH in relation to the luminescence intensity at optimum pH, is much greater at low temperatures, and decreases as the temperature is raised towards the optimum temperature. The observed maximum intensity of luminescence is thus shifted to slightly higher temperatures by increase in (H+). The apparent activation energy of luminescence is increased by a decrease in pH. The value of ΔH‡ at pH 5. 05 was calculated to be 40, 900 calories, in comparison with 20, 700 at a pH of 6. 92. The difference of 20, 200 is taken to represent an estimate of the heat of ionization of ALH in the activation process, and compares roughtly with the 14, 000 calories estimated for the same process, by analyzing the data {{from the point of view}} of hydrogen ions as an inhibitor. The decreasing temperature coefficient for luminescence in proceeding from low temperatures towards the optimum is accounted for in part by the greater degree of ionization of ALH. At the optimum temperature and acid reactions, pressures up to about 500 atmospheres <b>retard</b> the <b>velocity</b> of the luminescent oxidation. At the same temperature, with decrease in hydrogen ion concentration, the pressure effect is much less, indicating a considerable volume increase in the process of ionization and activation. In the extremely alkaline range, beyond pH 9, luminescence is greatly reduced, as compared with the intensity at neutrality, and under these conditions pressure causes a pronounced increase in intensity, presumably by acting upon the reversible denaturation equilibrium of the protein enzyme, A. Sulfanilamide, in neutral solutions, acts on luminescence in a manner very much resembling that of hydrogen ions at acidities between pH 4. 0 and pH 6. 5. Like the hydrogen ion equilibrium, the sulfanilamide equilibrium involves a ratio of approximately one inhibitor molecule to one enzyme molecule. The heat of reaction amounts to about 11, 600 calories or more in a reversible combination that evidently evolves heat. Like the action of H ions, sulfanilamide causes a slight shifting of maximum luminescence intensity in the direction of higher temperatures, and an increase in the energy of activation. The effect of sulfanilamide on the growth of broth cultures of eight species of luminous bacteria indicates that there is no regular relationship among the different organisms between the concentration of the drug that prevents growth, and that which prevents luminescence in the cells which develop in the presence of sulfanilamide. p-Aminobenzoic acid (PAB) antagonizes the sulfanilamide inhibition of growth in luminous bacteria, and the cultures that develop are luminous. When (PAB) is added to cells from fully developed cultures, it has no effect on luminescence, or causes a slight inhibition, depending on the concentration. With luminescence partly inhibited by sulfanilamide, the addition of PAB has no effect, or has an inhibitory effect which adds to that caused by sulfanilamide. Two different, though possibly related, enzyme systems thus appear to limit growth and luminescence, respectively. The possible mechanism through which both the inhibitions and the antagonism take place is discussed. The irreversible destruction of the luminescent system at temperatures above that of the maximum luminescence, in a medium of favorable pH to which no inhibitors have been added, proceeds logarithmically with time at both normal and increased hydrostatic pressures. Pressure retards the rate of the destruction, and the analysis of the data indicates that a volume increase of roughly 71 cc. per gm. molecule at 32 ° C. takes place in going from the normal to the activated state in this reaction. At normal pressure, the rate of destruction has a temperature coefficient of approximately 90, 000 calories, or about 20, 000 calories more than the heat of reaction in the reversible denaturation equilibrium. The data indicate that the equilibrium and the rate process are two distinct reactions. The equation for luminescence intensity, taking into account both the reversible and irreversible phases of the reaction is given below. In the equation b is a proportionality constant; k' the rate constant of the luminescent reaction; A 0 the total luciferase; A 0 i the total initial luciferase at time t equals 0; kn the rate constant for the destruction of the native, active form of the enzyme; kd the rate constant for the destruction of the reversibly denatured, inactive form; t the time; and the other symbols are as indicated above: See PDF for Equation For reasons cited in the text, kn evidently equals kd. Urethane and alcohol, respectively, act in a manner (Type II) that promotes the breaking of the type of bonds broken in both the reversible and irreversible reactions and so promotes the irreversible denaturation. This result is in contrast to the effects of sulfanilamide, which at appropriate concentrations may give rise to the same initial inhibition as that caused by urethane, but remains constant with time. The inhibition caused by urethane and alcohol, respectively, increases as the temperature is raised. As a result, the apparent optimum is shifted to lower temperatures, and the activation energy for the over-all process of luminescence diminishes. An analysis for the approximate heat of reaction in the equilibrium between these drugs and the enzyme, indicates 65, 000 calories for urethane, and 37, 000 for alcohol. A similar analysis with respect to the effect of hydroxyl ions as the inhibitor gives 60, 300 calories. The effects of alcohol and urethane are sensitive to hydrostatic pressure. Moderate inhibitions at optimum temperature and pH, caused by relatively small concentrations of either drug, are completely abolished by pressures of 3, 000 to 4, 000 pounds per square inch. At optimum temperature and pH, increasing concentrations of alcohol caused the apparent optimum pressure for luminescence to shift markedly in the direction of higher pressures. Analysis of the data with respect to concentration of alcohol at different pressures indicated that the ratio of alcohol to enzyme molecules amounted to approximately 4, at 7, 000 pounds, but only about 2. 8 at normal pressures. This phenomenon was taken to indicate that more than one equilibrium is established between the alcohol and the protein. A similar interpretation was suggested in connection with the fact that analysis of the relation between concentration of urethane and amount of inhibition at different temperatures also indicated a ratio of urethane to enzyme molecules that increased with temperature in the equilibria involved. Analysis of the data with respect to pressure and the inhibition caused by a given concentration of alcohol at different temperatures indicated that the volume change involved in the combination of alcohol with the enzyme must be very small, while the actual effect of pressure is apparently mediated through the reversible denaturation of the protein enzyme, which is promoted by alcohol, urethane, and drugs of similar type...|$|R
