5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. <b>Rhizoctonia</b> solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} fungi infect {{the roots of}} waratahs, causing {{significant}} plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, blackening and dieback or part {{or all of the}} plant, or lack of proteoid roots. The most common pathogen is the soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, which appears to be more problematic in cultivated plants than in wild populations. Mass plantings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and at Mount Annan planted before the 2000 Summer Olympics were devastated by the disease. <b>Rhizoctonia</b> solani can cause damping off or root rot, and is an uncommon pathogen. Cylindrocarpon scoparium and C. destructans (now Nectria radicicola) are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant. Although significant problems, fungi {{are less likely to be}} the cause of plant morbidity than poor drainage or soil conditions.|$|E
25|$|Ceratobasidium ramicola = AG-A (also {{includes}} several invalidly published, anamorph names including <b>Rhizoctonia</b> candida, R. endophytica, and R. fragariae). This group contains {{a range of}} crop pathogens and orchid associates.|$|E
25|$|The {{historically}} significant Phytophthora infestans (late blight) {{remains an}} ongoing problem in Europe and the United States. Other potato diseases include <b>Rhizoctonia,</b> Sclerotinia, black leg, powdery mildew, powdery scab and leafroll virus.|$|E
25|$|Some pests, {{such as the}} alfalfa weevil, aphids, armyworms, and {{the potato}} leafhopper, can reduce alfalfa yields dramatically, {{particularly}} with the second cutting when weather is warmest. Registered insecticides or chemical controls are sometimes used to prevent this and labels will specify the withholding period before the forage crop can be grazed or cut for hay or silage. Alfalfa is also susceptible to root rots, including Phytophthora, <b>Rhizoctonia,</b> and Texas root rot.|$|E
25|$|According to Krakauer, a well-nourished {{person might}} consume {{the seeds and}} survive because the body can use its stores of glucose and amino acids to rid itself of the poison. Since McCandless lived on a diet of rice, lean meat, and wild plants and had less than 10% body fat when he died, Krakauer {{hypothesized}} that McCandless was likely unable {{to fend off the}} toxins. However, when the Eskimo potatoes from the area around the bus were later tested in a laboratory of the University of Alaska Fairbanks by Dr. Thomas Clausen, toxins were not found. Krakauer later modified his hypothesis, suggesting that mold of the variety <b>Rhizoctonia</b> leguminicola may have caused McCandless's death. <b>Rhizoctonia</b> leguminicola is known to cause digestion problems in livestock, and may have aided McCandless's impending starvation. Krakauer hypothesised that the bag in which Chris kept the potato seeds was damp and the seeds thus became moldy. If McCandless had eaten seeds that contained this mold, he could have become sick, and Krakauer suggests that he thus became unable {{to get out of bed}} and so starved. His basis for the mold hypothesis is a photograph that shows seeds in a bag. Following chemical analysis of the seeds, Krakauer now believes that the seeds themselves are poisonous.|$|E
50|$|The {{anamorphic}} species <b>Rhizoctonia</b> zeae, originally {{described as}} the causal agent of ear rot of maize, is a synonym of Waitea circinata. <b>Rhizoctonia</b> oryzae has also been considered a synonym, but the name is not validly published and is of doubtful application (it has also been considered a synonym of <b>Rhizoctonia</b> solani). The name <b>Rhizoctonia</b> circinata {{has been used for}} the anamorph of Waitea circinata, but is not validly published and appears to be a portmanteau error.|$|E
50|$|Lysobacter {{species have}} also been {{isolated}} from soils suppressive to <b>Rhizoctonia</b> solani. Clay soils with natural suppressiveness against <b>Rhizoctonia</b> contained higher numbers of antagonistic isolates of L. gummosus, L. antibioticus, and/or L. capsici. Although the mechanism behind this phenomenon is not yet understood, it appeared that growing grass/clover {{increased the number of}} these Lysobacter species, as well as the <b>Rhizoctonia</b> suppressiveness.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Rhizoctonia</b> species {{thrives in}} {{temperatures}} ranging from 70°F to 90°F but can survive in freezing temperatures. [...] Brown patch is most common when night temperatures fail to drop below 68°F and during {{extended periods of}} high humidity or prolonged leaf wetness. The <b>Rhizoctonia</b> species has two specific fungi that affects the turf plant {{at different times of}} the year. In most cases <b>Rhizoctonia</b> solani will cause Brown patch in June throughout early July. While when temperatures begin to heat up and the air becomes more humid <b>Rhizoctonia</b> solani will become <b>Rhizoctonia</b> zeae. [...] It has been found that Brown patch thrives on lush and succulent turfgrass that have high nitrogen levels versus grass maintained with moderate levels. It has been found that the <b>Rhizoctonia</b> species is capable of surviving in the soil for many years without affecting turfgrass. During the winter months the fungus will lie dormant in the grass tissue or soil and form into resting bodies called sclerotia.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of a}} {{move towards}} a more natural {{classification}} of fungi, R.T. Moore proposed in 1987 that <b>Rhizoctonia</b> should be restricted to the type species and its relatives, with unrelated species moved to other genera. Unfortunately, {{this meant that the}} best-known but unrelated species, <b>Rhizoctonia</b> solani (teleomorph Thanatephorus cucumeris), would have undergone a name change to Moniliopsis solani. To avoid this, it was subsequently proposed that R. solani should replace R. crocorum as the type species of <b>Rhizoctonia.</b> This proposal was passed and the type of <b>Rhizoctonia</b> is now conserved as R. solani under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Rhizoctonia</b> was {{introduced}} in 1815 by French mycologist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle for plant pathogenic fungi that produce both hyphae and sclerotia. [...] "Rhizoctonia" [...] means [...] "root killer" [...] and de Candolle's original species, <b>Rhizoctonia</b> crocorum (teleomorph Helicobasidium purpureum), is the causal agent of violet root rot of carrots and other root vegetables. Subsequent authors added over 100 additional names to the genus, most of them plant pathogens bearing only a superficial resemblance to the type species. <b>Rhizoctonia</b> thus became an artificial form genus comprising a diverse range of unrelated species.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{symptoms}} caused by A. euteiches {{can be difficult}} to distinguish from symptoms caused by other root-infecting plant pathogens (such as Pythium, <b>Rhizoctonia,</b> and Fusarium), there are some distinct differences. Aphanomyces root rot rarely results in seed rot and/or pre-emergent damping-off. The characteristic lesions caused by the different pathogens also differ. Fusarium infection results in black or reddish vascular tissue, and <b>Rhizoctonia</b> infection results in sunken, cankerous lesions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rhizoctonia</b> is a genus of {{anamorphic}} {{fungi in}} the order Cantharellales. Species do not produce spores, but are composed of hyphae and sclerotia (hyphal propagules) and are asexual states of fungi in the genus Thanatephorus. <b>Rhizoctonia</b> species are saprotrophic, but are also facultative plant pathogens, causing commercially important crop diseases. They are also endomycorrhizal associates of orchids. The genus name was formerly used to accommodate many superficially similar, but unrelated fungi.|$|E
