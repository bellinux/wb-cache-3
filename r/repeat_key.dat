50|$|Lebanese zajal is a semi-improvised, semi-sung or declaimed form {{of poetry}} in the colloquial Lebanese Arabic dialect. Its roots {{may be as}} ancient as Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, but various similar manifestations of zajal {{can be traced to}} 10th-12th-century Moorish Spain (Al-Andalus), and {{specifically}} to the colloquial poet Ibn Quzman (Cordoba, 1078-1160). Zajal has close ties in prosody, delivery, form and spirit with various semi-sung colloquial poetry traditions, including such seemingly disparate traditions as those of Nabati Poetry of Arabia and the troubadours of Provence. Many Near-Eastern, Arabian and Mediterranean cultures (including Greece, Algeria, Morocco, Spain and southern France) had, or still have, rich semi-improvised, semi-sung colloquial poetry traditions, which share some traits with Lebanese zajal, such as the verbal duel (e.g. the jeu parti of the troubadours), the use of tambourines or other minimalist percussion instruments, and a chanting chorus of men (Reddadi, in Lebanese) who <b>repeat</b> <b>key</b> verses or refrains recited by the poets.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The BARE- 1 {{retrotransposon}} is an active, dispersed, {{and highly}} abundant {{component of the}} genome of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and other species in its genus. Like all retrotransposons of its kind, BARE- 1 is bounded by long terminal repeats (LTRs). We have developed two ampli"cation-based marker methods based on the position of given LTRs within the genome. The IRAP (Inter-Retrotransposon Ampli"ed Polymorphism) markers are generated by the proximity of two LTRs using outward-facing primers annealing to LTR target sequences. In RE-MAP (REtrotransposon-Microsatellite Ampli"ed Poly-morphism), ampli"cation between LTRs proximal to simple sequence repeats such as constitute microsatel-lites produces markers. The methods can distinguish between barley varieties and produce "ngerprint pat-terns for species across the genus. The patterns indicate that although the BARE- 1 family of retrotransposons is disperse, these elements are locally clustered or nes-ted and often found near tandem arrays of a simple sequence <b>repeat.</b> <b>Key</b> words Hordeum vulgare ' Retrotransposon BARE- 1 ' REMAP ' IRAP ' Molecular marke...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a number of studies which have {{indicated}} the limited effectiveness of health education efforts using the mass media are reviewed. The cause of these failures, according to the authors was the inability to apply a number of principles of effective design to the instructional materials used in the mass media.

40|$|International audienceMetacognition {{refers to}} the ability of an {{organism}} to evaluate its states of knowledge (metacognitive monitoring) and engage in appropriate information-seeking behaviors when a lack of knowledge is detected (metacognitive control). This study assessed metacognitive monitoring and control in three Guinea baboons (Papio papio). Monkeys were required to report on a touchscreen the location of two target stimuli that had previously appeared briefly on a grid. They could either respond directly or use a ``Repeat'' key providing an opportunity to repeat the target stimuli. In Experiment 1, the baboons used the <b>Repeat</b> <b>key</b> more frequently in difficult trials and transferred this use of the key to novel conditions. Two baboons showed higher accuracy when they declined using the key compared to Baseline trials in which the key was not available, suggesting accurate metacognitive monitoring judgments. The same two baboons were consistently faster at reporting the targets' locations after a repetition of the stimulus. In Experiment 2, the baboons had to choose between two Repeat keys, one for each target. Two baboons showed a preference for repeating the presentation of the less visible target, suggesting that they identified what information they lack. Overall, results support the hypothesis of metacognitive monitoring in baboons, and also provide limited evidence for metacognitive control. We propose that tests requiring subjects to choose between several metacognitive responses in computerized tasks provide a suitable new approach for studying targeted information-seeking behaviors in animals...|$|E

GPs and PNs were invited to complete a validated self‐ completed questionnaire used in our previous research on their assessment and management of obese patients and attitudes to health literacy. Findings There were 61 participants: 37 GPs and 24 PNs. More than half reported often assessing diet, physical activity and Body Mass Index (BMI) but only a quarter reported doing so for waist circumference. Most reported often advising patients to eat less fat and do regular exercise, especially GPs. Goal setting and referral was less frequently reported. GPs were more confident about these activities than PNs. Both reported infrequently assessing patients’ level of health literacy, asking patients to <b>repeat</b> <b>key</b> points or assisting them to access programs. They most frequently reported lack of patient interest, and lack of time as barriers. Their attitudes were mostly positive towards treatment of obesity. However only 15 % reported being successful with 26 % enjoying the challenge of helping obese patients to manage their weight.

Since then, numerous national metrology institutes (NMIs) have been setting up facilities for gas analysis, and have developed claims for their Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) for these mixtures. Furthermore, in the April 2005 meeting of the CCQM (Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance) Gas Analysis Working Group, a policy was proposed to <b>repeat</b> <b>key</b> comparisons for stable mixtures every 10 years. This comparison was performed in line with the policy proposal and provided an opportunity for NMIs that could not participate in the previous comparison. NMISA from South Africa acted as the pilot laboratory. Of the 25 participating laboratories, 19 (76 %) showed satisfactory degrees of equivalence to the gravimetric reference value. The results show that the CO concentration is not influenced by the measurement method used, and from this it may be concluded that the pure CO, used to prepare the gas mixtures, was not 13 C-isotope depleted. This was confirmed by the isotope ratio analysis carried out by KRISS on a 1 % mixture of CO in nitrogen, obtained from the NMISA.
