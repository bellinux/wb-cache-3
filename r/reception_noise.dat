50|$|In radio <b>reception,</b> <b>noise</b> is the {{superposition}} {{of white}} noise and other disturbing {{influences on the}} signal, caused either by thermal noise and other electronic noise from receiver input circuits or by interference from radiated electromagnetic noise {{picked up by the}} receiver's antenna. If no noise were picked up with radio signals, even weak transmissions could be received at virtually any distance by making a radio receiver that was sensitive enough. In practice, this doesn't work, and a point is reached where the only way to extend the range of a transmission is to increase the transmitter power.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the {{communication}} process, {{the message is}} subject to irrelevant factors that can distort or interfere with its <b>reception.</b> <b>Noise</b> is the physical or Psychological fundamentals either from inside or outside {{of the process of}} communication. Noise acts as a barrier as it makes the message less accurate, less productive and unclear. It may even prevent the message from ever reaching the receiver. Physical noise is often triggered by badly made images or messages (e.g. poor print quality) or elements of distraction (e.g. consumer scrolling through TV advertisements). Psychological noise could be mixed meanings, poor credibility of source or the insignificance of the message to the consumer requirements. Not having a connection with the receiver and lacking in common ground usually cause this. This may result in unsuitable encoding of the message such as; using a sign, symbol, or word that is unfamiliar or has different meaning to the receiver (e.g. sending a message in foreign language that is not understood by the receiver). The more common ground there is between the sender and the receiver, the less likely it is for noise and barriers to interrupt a message.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Molecular {{communication}} (MC) {{will enable}} the exchange of information among nanoscale devices. In this novel bioinspired communication paradigm, molecules are employed to encode, transmit and receive information. In the most general case, these molecules are propagated in the medium by means of free diffusion. An information theoretical analysis of diffusion-based MC is required {{to better understand the}} potential of this novel communication mechanism. The study and the modeling of the noise sources is of utmost importance for this analysis. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a mathematical study of the noise at the reception of the molecular information in a diffusion-based MC system when the ligand-binding reception is employed. The reference diffusion-based MC system for this analysis is the physical end-to-end model introduced in a previous work by the same authors, where the reception process is realized through ligandbinding chemical receptors. The <b>reception</b> <b>noise</b> is modeled in this paper by following two different approaches, namely, through the ligand-receptor kinetics and through the stochastic chemical kinetics. The ligand-receptor kinetics allows to simulate the random perturbations in the chemical processes of the reception, while the stochastic chemical kinetics provides the tools to derive a closedform solution to the modeling of the <b>reception</b> <b>noise.</b> The ligand-receptor kinetics model is expressed through a block scheme, while the stochastic chemical kinetics results in the characterization of the <b>reception</b> <b>noise</b> using stochastic differential equations. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the analytical formulation of the <b>reception</b> <b>noise</b> in terms of stochastic chemical kinetics is compliant with the <b>reception</b> <b>noise</b> behavior resulting from the ligand-receptor kinetics simulations.

The transmitted signal reconstruction in [1] is just using the existing initial condition estimation method. But here, the transmitted signal reconstruction is using PEM. In doing so, the reconstruction error is much smaller than that caused by just using the existing initial condition estimation method especially at low SNR. The reason is that: dividing the whole received signal into several small parts enhances the reconstruction accuracy; using the improved SDM decreases the initial condition estimation error in every divided part.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{measured}} {{the effects of}} a digital hearing aid on speech recognition or <b>reception</b> in <b>noise</b> for two noise reduction concepts: active noise reduction by speech-sensitive processing (SSP) and improved directionality by a dual- or so-called twin-microphone system (TMS). This was conducted in a well-controlled clinical field trial in 16 hearing-aid users, using a single-blind crossover design. The hearing aid fitting was controlled by insertion gain measurements and measurements with loudness scaling. This study combined laboratory experiments with three consecutive field trials of 4 weeks each. We used performance measurements (speech recognition tests in background noise), paired comparisons, and self-report measurements (questionnaires). The speech recognition or reception tests were performed before and after each field trial, the paired comparisons were performed in weeks 4 and 12, and the questionnaires were administered after each field trial. For all subjects, results were obtained for three different settings: no noise reduction, SSP alone, and TMS alone. In the last week, we also performed speech recognition or reception tests in background noise with both noise reduction concepts combined. Three types of results have been reported: "objective" results from the critical signal to noise ratios for speech recognition or reception in different background noises for different settings and "subjective" results: paired comparisons and questionnaires. The subjective scores show the same trend as the objective scores. The effects of TMS were clearly positive, especially for the speech reception threshold tests and for the paired comparisons.

40|$|In a {{large-scale}} wireless sensor network, {{it is often}} desirable to {{count the number of}} nodes in the network, or the number of nodes that are within communications range of a particular node. In such networks, nodes are deployed {{for a wide variety of}} military and civilian applications. These applications require a balance among the number of operating nodes, energy efficiency, and the lifetime of the network. The number of operating nodes is a very crucial factor for the networks. However, the number of operating nodes can vary with time due to various artificial as well as natural reasons (for example, some nodes might fail and some could be damaged because of fouling and corrosion, or batteries might fail). It is therefore a matter of great interest for a communication network to know how many operating nodes or transmitters are available in the region at any point in time to ensure proper network operation (such as routing), as well as to obtain optimum performance or to prevent failure of the mission by network maintenance (such as replacement of faulty nodes). Similarly, a concurrent estimation of the dimensionality of the network might also be important for localising the nodes and estimating their number in a deployed network. To date, techniques employed to estimate the number of nodes and dimensionality have been based on some aspect of the communications protocol(s) in use. The protocol technique can be very hard to implement in harsh environment (e. g. underwater) due to the unavoidable capture effect, poor efficiency due to long propagation delay, high path loss, etc. In this thesis, we propose a novel estimation technique based on cross-correlation of random signals, in which the ratio of the mean of the cross-correlation function to its standard deviation determines the number of nodes. Within the limited scope of this thesis, we have provided some estimation techniques to estimate the number of nodes and network dimensionality. The proposed number of node estimation techniques also addresses a number of practical issues in a digital receiver and channel, including fractional-sample delays, multipath <b>reception,</b> <b>noise</b> etc. An error analysis is provided with comparison to conventional protocol techniques that demonstrates the superior performance of this technique to protocol-based methods.
