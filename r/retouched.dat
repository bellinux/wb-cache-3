The main objective of this thesis is to explain the term digital <b>retouching</b> and indicate usable options for commercial matters. This thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part describes basic terms, which are related to digital <b>retouching.</b> The author also shares his personal experience and recommendation related to this topic. The second part describes suitable techniques for <b>retouching</b> in the category of technical <b>retouching</b> and creative <b>retouching.</b> In this thesis I presume that a reader should have basic knowledge of using programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom.

5|$|On October 5, 2004, Aladdin was re{{released}} onto VHS and for {{the first}} time released onto DVD, as part of Disney's Platinum Edition line. The DVD release featured <b>retouched</b> and cleaned-up animation, prepared for Aladdin's planned but ultimately cancelled IMAX reissue in 2003, and a second disc with bonus features. Accompanied by a $19 million marketing campaign, the DVD sold about 3million units in its first month, but it was less than the number of copies, sold in that amount of time, by any other Platinum Edition released before it. The film's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008, along with its sequels.|$|E
5|$|The artwork for {{the album}} cover of Trans-Europe Express was {{originally}} {{going to be}} a monochrome picture of the group reflected in a series of mirrors. This idea was dropped for a photo by New York-based celebrity photographer Maurice Seymour, with the group dressed in suits to resemble mannequins. J. Stara's image of the group was taken in Paris and is a highly <b>retouched</b> photo-montage of Kraftwerk from their shoulders up again posed as mannequins which are shown {{on the cover of the}} English version of the album. On the inside sleeve, a color collage of the group sitting at a small cafe table designed by Emil Schult was used. The photo for this scene was from the session by Maurice Seymour, taken on the group's American tour. Other photos were taken by Schult that show the group laughing and smiling. These were not used for the album's release.|$|E
5|$|The finder did not {{initially}} realise {{that he had}} found a Roman artefact and thought at first that it was a Victorian ornament. He eventually identified it as Roman by consulting auction catalogues, searching the Internet and getting advice from dealers. Find Liaison Officers from the Portable Antiquities Scheme were notified of the discovery and visited the findspot along with the finder. Christie's commissioned Darren Bradbury, an independent conservator and restorer, to restore the helmet and visor for sale. Although Christie's was asked to delay the restoration so that a full scientific examination could be carried out, this request was not granted and information about the helmet's burial may have been lost as a result. However, the British Museum was able to inspect the find during restoration and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was carried out to determine the composition of the headpiece, visor and griffin. Bradbury's restoration work took some 240 hours and involved the repair of cracks and holes using resin and cyanoacrylate, <b>retouched</b> to match the appearance of the surrounding material.|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{amount of}} <b>retouch</b> on stone tools {{is central to}} many archaeological studies linking stone tool assemblages to broader issues of human social and economic land-use strategies. Unfortunately, most <b>retouch</b> measures deal with flake and blade tools and few (if any) {{have been developed for}} hafted bifaces and projectile points. This paper introduces a new index for measuring and comparing amount of <b>retouch</b> on hafted bifaces and projectile points that can be applied regardless of size or typological variance. The <b>retouch</b> index is assessed initially with an experimental data set of hafted bifaces that were dulled and resharpened on five occasions. The <b>retouch</b> index is then applied to a hafted biface assemblage made from tool stone that has been sourced by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). Results of both assessments show that the hafted biface <b>retouch</b> index (HRI) is effective for determining the amount of <b>retouch</b> {{and the degree to which}} the hafted bifaces have been curated.

50|$|<b>Retouch</b> {{may simply}} consist of roughly {{trimming}} an edge by striking with a hammerstone, or on smaller, finer flake or blade tools {{it is sometimes}} carried out by pressure flaking. Other forms of <b>retouch</b> may include burination, which is <b>retouch</b> that is conducted in a parallel orientation to the flake margin. <b>Retouch</b> is often taken {{as one of the}} most obvious features distinguishing a tool from a waste by-product of lithic manufacture (debitage).|$|R
5|$|The stone tool {{technology}} in {{use during the}} Middle Stone Age shows a mosaic of techniques. Beginning approximately 300 kya, the large cutting tools of the Achuelian are gradually displaced by Levallois prepared core technologies, also widely used by Neanderthals during the European Middle Palaeolithic. As the MSA progresses, highly varied technocomplexes become common throughout Africa and include pointed artifacts, blades, <b>retouched</b> flakes, end and side scrapers, grinding stones, and even bone tools. However, the use of blades (associated mainly with the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe) is seen at many sites as well. In Africa, blades {{may have been used}} during the transition from the Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age onwards. Finally, during the later part of the Middle Stone Age, microlithic technologies aimed at producing replaceable components of composite hafted tools are seen from at least 70 ka at sites such as Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Artefacts: core-burins {{on large}} flakes, {{unidirectional}} blade and flake cores, (mostly <b>retouched</b> blades and <b>retouched</b> pointed blades, while other common types include burins, atypical end scrapers, sidescrapers (grattoir de côté) and Mousterian points) and Levallois forms. The Levallois forms {{are concentrated in}} the basal layers, especially stratum 19. The principal raw material is local petrified limestone.|$|E
25|$|Concurrent {{with the}} sonar readings, the {{floodlit}} camera obtained {{a pair of}} underwater photographs. Both depicted {{what appeared to be}} a rhomboid flipper, although sceptics have dismissed the images as the bottom of the loch, air bubbles, a rock, or a fish fin. The apparent flipper was photographed in different positions, indicating movement. The first flipper photo is better-known than the second, and both were enhanced and <b>retouched</b> from the original negatives. According to team member Charles Wyckoff, the photos were <b>retouched</b> to superimpose the flipper; the original enhancement showed a considerably less-distinct object. No one is sure how the originals were altered.|$|E

50|$|This {{is quite}} simply a {{description}} of where exactly the <b>retouch</b> {{is located on the}} flake. The key here is to be very specific. The <b>retouch</b> extensiveness for each area should also be described. This entails whether the <b>retouch</b> is total or partial. Proper flake terminology should be used in these descriptions.|$|R

40|$|<b>Retouching</b> can {{significantly}} elevate the visual appeal of photos, but many casual photographers lack the expertise {{to do this}} well. To address this problem, previous works have proposed automatic <b>retouching</b> systems based on supervised learning from paired training images acquired before and after manual editing. As {{it is difficult for}} users to acquire paired images that reflect their <b>retouching</b> preferences, we present in this paper a deep learning approach that is instead trained on unpaired data, namely a set of photographs that exhibits a <b>retouching</b> style the user likes, which is much easier to collect. Our system is formulated using deep convolutional neural networks that learn to apply different <b>retouching</b> operations on an input image. Network training with respect to various types of edits is enabled by modeling these <b>retouching</b> operations in a unified manner as resolution-independent differentiable filters. To apply the filters in a proper sequence and with suitable parameters, we employ a deep reinforcement learning approach that learns to make decisions on what action to take next, given {{the current state of the}} image. In contrast to many deep learning systems, ours provides users with an understandable solution in the form of conventional <b>retouching</b> edits, rather than just a "black box" result. Through quantitative comparisons and user studies, we show that this technique generates <b>retouching</b> results consistent with the provided photo set...|$|R

50|$|Through ethnographic {{research}} in Central Australia, Hiscock found that <b>retouch</b> may be conducted on a flake that is ultimately rejected {{as a tool}} for use. This shows that <b>retouch</b> may, in some cases, not be a sign of extending the use life of a tool. It may simply be an attempt to make a tool viable for use {{in the first place and}} can indicate that particular tool’s unsuitability for use. This calls into question many of the basic assumptions made based on <b>retouch</b> and suggests that archaeologists may need to rethink exactly what <b>retouch</b> may mean.|$|R

Not for re-distribution, re-sale or use in derivative works. ©Measuring <b>retouch</b> amounts on stone tools has been helpful for understanding human organizational strategies. Multiple <b>retouch</b> indices geared toward assessing <b>retouch</b> amounts on flake tools and unifaces have been developed, but few {{have been developed to}} evaluate <b>retouch</b> exclusively for bifaces. For this study, a <b>retouch</b> index was developed and evaluated on an experimental assemblage of bifaces. It is shown that reduction activities on bifaces may create extensive amounts of <b>retouch</b> that are contingent upon a number of factors from both the production and resharpening events that must be taken into consideration before understanding a biface's life history.

25|$|VanDerZee worked {{predominantly}} in {{the studio}} and used a variety of props, including architectural elements, backdrops, and costumes, to achieve stylized tableaux vivant in keeping with late Victorian and Edwardian visual traditions. Sitters often copied celebrities of the 1920s and 1930s in their poses and expressions, and he <b>retouched</b> negatives and prints heavily to achieve an aura of glamour.

25|$|With the {{critical}} {{methods of the}} 16th century, Grosseteste's view of the Testaments was rejected, and the book was disparaged as a mere Christian forgery for nearly four centuries. Presently, scholarly opinions are still divided {{as to whether it}} is an originally Jewish document that has been <b>retouched</b> by Christians, or a Christian document written originally in Greek but based on some earlier Semitic-language material. Scholarship tends to focus on this book as a Christian work, whether or not it has a Jewish predecessor (Vorlage).|$|E
25|$|Works by VanDerZee are artistic {{as well as}} {{technically}} proficient. His {{work was}} in high demand, {{in part due to}} his experimentation and skill in double exposures and in retouching negatives of children. One theme that recurs in his photographs was the emergent black middle class, which he captured using traditional techniques in often idealistic images. Negatives were <b>retouched</b> to show glamor and an aura of perfection. This affected the likeness of the person photographed, but he felt each photo should transcend the subject.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Retouching</b> uses many of {{the same}} tools and {{techniques}} as hand-colouring, but with the intent of covering damage, hiding unwanted features, accentuating details, or adding missing elements in a photographic print. In a portrait <b>retouching</b> could be used to improve a sitter's appearance, for instance, by removing facial blemishes, and in a landscape with an overexposed sky, clouds could be painted into the image.
