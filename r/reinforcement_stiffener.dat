40|$|The {{presentation}} {{reports on}} {{results of a}} conceptual design phase of a collaborative research programme aiming at the development of manufacture-optimized lattice fuselage structures satisfying fundamental requirements of airworthiness. It will be shown how topology optimization was used to analyse different load cases and maximize the stiffness of the fuselage barrel, which was done by University of Leeds. As result it will be presented what efficient pattern of ribs could be identified to carry given sets of loads. Adding buckling criteria to the structural analysis and manufacturing demands DLR will show a pattern of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>stiffeners</b> which has been established to provide a backing to the specific choice of the preliminary design concept. As result an innovative airframe concept will be presented with high function integration, high damage resistance capability and under consideration of actual airworthiness requirements and demands...|$|R
40|$|On April 5, 1991, a {{solid rocket}} booster (SRB) forward skirt serial number (S/N) 20022 {{sustained}} buckling damage during water impact after {{the launch of}} Space Transportation System Flight 37 (STS- 37). As of that date, five forward skirts had been lost during water impact. Repair attempts began with the least damaged skirt available (S/N 20022). Sp ecial hydraulic tooling {{was used to remove}} buckled areas of the skirt. Afterwards, its aft clevis pinholes were found to be out of alignment with the redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM) check gauge, but weld passes were used to correct this condition. Meanwhile, USA Analytics generated mechanical property data for buckled and subsequently debuckled material. Their analysis suggested that structural integrity might be improved by adding stringer <b>reinforcements,</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> to the aft bay section of the skirt. This improvement was recommended as a fleet modification to be implemented on a case-by-case basis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Extended Finite Element Method (xFEM) {{has been}} applied to {{simulate}} fatigue crack growth in an AA 2024 -T 351 T welded joint, 5 mm thick, made by friction stir welding. The ABAQUS and Morfeo software has been used. Tensile fatigue loading (mean stress 10 MPa, stress ratio R= 0) is applied to Tjoints with a configuration suitable for reinforced panels where both skin and the web (<b>reinforcement</b> or <b>stiffener)</b> is made of a high strength AA 2024 -T 351. Crack is introduced in one edge of the skin base material. The properties of materials in the areas of joints and geometry measures of Tjoint are adopted from available experiments. Following numerical results are obtained: crack front coordinates (x, y, z) and stress intensity factors (KI, KII, KIII and Kef) distribution along the crack tip, as well as the fatigue life estimation for every crack propagation step.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the effect of cutout and flange reinforcement on the buckling and post-buckling behaviour of a carbon/epoxy composite C-section structure. The C-section having a cutout in the web is clamped at one end and subjected to a shear load at the other free end. Three different <b>stiffener</b> <b>reinforcements</b> were investigated in finite element analysis by using MSC Nastran. Buckling load was predicted by using both linear and nonlinear FE analysis. Experiments were carried out to validate the numerical model and results. Subsequently post-buckling analysis was carried out by predicting the load–deflection response of the C-section beam in nonlinear analysis. Tsai-Wu failure criterion was used to detect the first-play-failure load. The effect of circular and diamond cutout shape and effective flange reinforcements were investigated. The results show that the cutout and reinforcement have little effect on the buckling stability. However an L-shape stiffener to reinforce the C-section flange can improve the critical failure load by 20. 9 %...|$|R
40|$|Incremental {{launching}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} steel bridge assembly methods used nowadays, its practical application consists in passing the bridge assembly through the launching shoes as well as over each support pile. In some cases, when plate girders are used, it is usual to find longitudinal <b>stiffeners</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in order to prevent web local buckling produced by the vertical reaction acting in the support pile. A considerable number of studies have focused on evaluating the impact of a single stiffener on the resistance of plate girder subjected to patch loading. However, the effect of multiple longitudinal stiffened plate girders subjected to lengthy compressive load has received little attention. Therefore, this paper aims at studying the influence of load bearing length on the ultimate strength of multiple longitudinally stiffened webs subjected to compressive loads. Patch loading resistance is numerically calculated using a previously validated nonlinear finite element analysis. Subsequently, a parametrical study is conducted to investigate the effect of the aforementioned load length and the relative position and size of the stiffeners on the ultimate strengthPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analytical}} and experimental study of stiffened graphite-epoxy compression panels with terminated stiffeners are presented. The local stress gradients at the stiffener termination location are determined by finite element analysis. Three stiffener termination concepts are evaluated by analysis to determine the stiffener and skin laminate parameters that affect the panel response and failure. The effects of changing local skin laminate definitions, skin <b>reinforcement</b> details, and <b>stiffener</b> termination details on local stress gradients and load-path eccentricities are discussed. Analytical and test results are presented for panels with one terminated stiffener and for panels with one terminated stiffener and two unterminated stiffeners. The effects of a cutout in {{the skin of a}} panel with a terminated stiffener is also evaluated to determine the interaction between the stress gradients in the panel due to the cutout and those due to the terminated stiffener. The results of the study indicate that the critical failure modes of the panels initiate at the skin-stiffener interface {{near the end of the}} terminated stiffener...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} proposed {{a new concept}} for deployable reflectors consisting of a thin parabolic carbon-fibre-reinforced-plastic (CFRP) shell stiffened along the edge by an elastically collapsible stiffener. Here we show that a stiffener accounting for less than 10 % of the total mass of the reflector increases the stiffness of the softest deformation mode of the deployed reflector by 48 times, and its fundamental natural frequency of vibration by 6. 8 times. These values are based on an optimized design of the stiffener, for a 4. 6 m diameter paraboloidal reflector with focal length-to-diameter ratio of 0. 28, which is detailed in the paper. Residual cooling stresses from the manufacturing process often induce relatively large distortions in thin CFRP structures – potentially reducing their surface accuracy. It is shown by analysis that these distortions are reduced {{by a factor of}} 100 in the proposed stiffened reflector.

40|$|Electroactive {{polymers}} {{have been}} studied for artificial muscle applications in last decades. One of the EAP materials, 3 M VHB acrylic tapes, have shown been outstanding electro-mechanical coupling performance. The scope {{of this study is}} to understand the electro-mechanical properties of VHB acrylic material. In addition, the research explores new practical designs of soft actuators. The basic designs employ directional planar stiffeners that act as geometric constraints. The utilization of these stiffeners provides the ability to tailor the planar deformation into many three dimensional deformed shapes. In the first part of this work, the material nonlinear mechanical response is characterized using a pre-stretched planar configuration with different bi-axial stretch ratios. Also, unequal bi-axial stretch ratios were also investigated. During the course of deformation, high resolution images of the deformed state were in situ captured. The images were analyzed by digital image correlation technique to evaluate the in-plane finite strain components. The measurements are used to calibrate a Neo-Hookean based material model that couples the applied electrical field to the actuator mechanical deformation. The material model is built into a user-material subroutine with the ABAQUS commercial finite element package. The numerical model is used to optimize different geometrical feature, electrode layup and stacking sequence for the actuator in order to attain a prescribed deformation pattern. The developed framework will aid in designing and optimizing the EAPs actuator configurations for general 3 D prescribed deformation configuration. In the second part of our work, we presented a new actuator design featuring a freestanding configuration without the constraints of pre-stretch. By using different configuration of <b>stiffener</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> the proposed design presented various complex three dimensional motions. A simple one-dimensional planar stiffener is utilized to measure the resulting curvature of the deformed configuration under different level of applied voltage. The Timoshenko-bimaterial laminate solution is employed to assess the electrical to mechanical conversion efficiency. The developed framework will address more complex 3 -D deformation. The whole work is a first step towards the development of soft actuators for artificial muscle applications...|$|R
40|$|Ultra-high Performance Fibre-Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) {{has emerged}} around 25 {{years ago as}} a {{fruitful}} result of dedicated research efforts based on the combination of three main ideas : Strength and compactness improvement of cement materials by intense reduction of the water to binder ratio, which was made more and more possible and efficient with R&D advances in superplasticizers and mineral additions; Use of fibers to provide post-cracking tensile capacity and pseudo-ductility, which was made possible thanks to more than two decades of conceptual and exploratory development of conventional fiber-reinforced concrete, and really efficient as compared to it due to the high quality of the matrix and the possiblity to incorporate high amounts of fibers; Reduction of natural imperfections due to aggregate in limiting their size and selecting very high quality materials in an optimized grading, which took benefit of aggregate packing models having being developed in the late 80 s. This combination enabled to produce several industrially controlled patented materials markedly overpassing the highest high-performance concrete available at this time, with 150 MPa-characteristic compressive strength at least, and possibly dispensing with the traditional use of secondary reinforcement due to material non-brittleness and with thick cover in aggressive environment. This allowed dispensing with keeping systematic continuity with traditional reinforced concrete design provisions. Moreover, mixing, placement, thermal treatment and formwork technology could be kept understood in the continuity with emerging self-compacting concrete. Twenty years ago, the first major applications, Sherbrooke footbridge (Canada) and prestressed beams for the renovation of the heat exchange zone in the cooling towers of Cattenom power plant (France), demonstrated outstanding strength and resistance to transfer, so that durability and lightness of prestressed members have appeared as main advantages to be searched in structural applications. The first recommendations for production, characterization of UHPFRC and structural design using these materials, published in France in 2002 [1], made it possible to explore the implementation possibilities of such materials especially for pre-stressed structures and non-reinforced thin elements. Application to bridges and footbridges (Bourg-lès-Valence in 2001, Sakata Mirai and Seoul - Seon Yu Footbridges in 2002, Pinel bridge in 2006, passerelle des Anges in 2008) motivated consistent research efforts to ensure controlled quality of the material produced and placed, and safe design provisions of lighter and thinner structures. Optimized shapes, like ITE® beams, ribbed slabs or shells, were demonstrated as favourable for valuable implementation, while cost-efficiency also relied on indirect material savings or lightness benefits for the method of execution. Besides valuable application in structural components, UHPFRC has been adopted for a decade by architects to develop attractive façade and roofing components, thanks to new aesthetic possibilities associated to durable mineral surface quality, lightness and possible complex shapes and semi-transparency, with typical examples of Villa Navarra roof and 'Les enfants du Paradis' net panels in 2007. For such elements, the use of organic or stainless steel fibres was developed, the range of mixes was extended addressing the fire-resistance demand and the possibly lower strength requirements, and ribbed plates or shells with passive <b>reinforcement</b> in the <b>stiffeners</b> tended to appear as structurally efficient. Growing interest and economic significance of this development in building applications turned out evident from the first international symposium strictly dedicated to UHPFRC applications, organized in Marseille (France) in 2009 [2]. From the same time however, UHPFRC produced volume took off also for less visible, however technically optimized projects of the extension of Haneda Airport in Tokyo, light prestressed bridges in Malaysia, or joint fills between precast beams in North American projects of 'accelerated bridge (re) construction'. The year 2013, associated to the second UHPFRC international symposium organized in Marseille [3] and revised edition of AFGC Recommendations, has constituted a significant milestone for UHPFRC in France. Two major projects associated to urban renovation, the MuCEM in Marseille (Fig. 1) and the Jean Bouin Stadium in Paris, had been completed, having led to widened awareness of technical and architectural capabilities of these 'new concretes' both among professional (architects and engineers) and for the public, including clients of constructions. Technical acceptance of the design, industrial processes and details associated to these projects, as well as previous satisfactory French 15 years-experience of building components and bridges made of UHPFRC, has made it possible to launch the standardization process in France. This has resulted in the elaboration of three complementary standards, related to UHPFRC structural design, material production and control, and execution of structures. The first two documents have been published in French and English in 2016 [4 - 5], the latter one is expected for 2017, as well as updating of the standard 'common rules' for precast concrete products. Although based on the technical consensus expressed in AFGC recommendations revised in 2013, the standards elaboration has promoted clarification and simplification of the ordering / qualification processes for easier UHPFRC contract implementation. Since 2013, international recognition especially within ACI Excellence in Concrete Construction Awards program has been gained not only for the MuCEM and Jean Bouin Stadium in 2015, but also for the 'Ring of Memory' at International Memorial of Notre-Dame de Lorette in 2016. Noticeably enough, due to optimization in conceptual design, UHPFRC has made possible competitive solutions not only for tailor-made projects, but also for typical bridge situations exemplified by the Buthaumont Bridge and the footbridge at Le Cannet des Maures. In Switzerland with the iconic example of Chillon viaducts, in the US with the Pulaski viaduct restoration, and progressively also in France, bridge deck repair or protection using UHPFRC has deserved increasing interest. Repair solutions, for buildings also, are increasingly considering UHPFRC due to specific versatility, structural and durability performance and weight savings, which results in cost-efficiency despite a possibly still high unitary material cost. However, the driving field of UHPFRC application in France has concerned cladding and roofing panels, for buildings (e. g. 'Vente Privée' Headquarters, 'La Mantilla' buildings [...] .) and for large infrastructure projects (e. g. Montpellier high speed railway station). UHPFRC solutions based on ultra-thin, highly transparent and architecturally appealing elements have thus been made possible in a cost-efficient way due to the lightness of these secondary elements. Consolidation of engineering and industrial know-how is a key condition for further development of such applications. This has been the case among several architects, designers, checkers, engineering offices, and precasting plants, although quite few. Education associated to the standards dissemination should strengthen these capabilities. Further research and development efforts should address advanced UHPFRC modelling, seismic design with UHPFRC, development of typical 'UHPFRC solutions', and non-conventional process optimization (sprayed UHPFRC, 3 D printing etc.) which could widen the scope of cost-efficient UHPFRC implementation...|$|R
