5|$|As {{both the}} other {{alternatives}} were discarded, consensus gradually grew for the Flåm alternative, and the Railway Committee for Nordre Bergenhus County recommended this proposal. New plans from NSB criticized {{the mix of}} rack and adhesion railway, and instead proposed a conventional adhesion line all the way. Engineer Ferdinand Bjerke traveled to Continental Europe to study several combined railways. He published a preliminary report in 1911, which recommended an adhesion railway, although he also felt {{the need for a}} detailed study of a <b>rack</b> <b>railway.</b> His final report was finished in 1913, and although it recommended adhesion, it pointed out that the line's capacity would be smaller than predicted and that costs would be three times as high—NOK5.5 million. The plans were approved by the Ministry of Labour and NSB's main board in 1915.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, the Holmenkollen Line {{was opened}} to Besserud. One of the line's main revenue sources was {{transporting}} city-dwellers to the recreational area of Nordmarka {{where they would}} go skiing. An alternative activity was tobogganing down the hill back to Majorstuen. The operator Holmenkolbanen immediately started plans to extend the line. There were two proposals: {{a continuation of the}} line past Holmenkollen and a branch from Midtstuen up Korketrekkeren to Frogneseteren. However, the latter required the use of a <b>rack</b> <b>railway,</b> as it would give a 1:8 gradient. The former route was selected and the line was extended to Frogneseteren in 1916. Holmenkolbanen started renting out sleds at Frogneseteren, which could be returned at most stations. To save the return ticket, many chose to continue the tobogganing ride to Majorstuen.|$|E

5|$|The summit {{observatory}} {{was built}} in the summer of 1883, and would remain in operation for 21 years. The first path to the summit was built {{at the same time as}} the observatory and was designed to allow ponies to carry up supplies, with a maximum gradient of one in five. The opening of the path and the observatory made the ascent of the Ben increasingly popular, all the more so after the arrival of the West Highland Railway in Fort William in 1894. Around this time the first of several proposals was made for a <b>rack</b> <b>railway</b> to the summit, none of which came to fruition.|$|E
25|$|The {{system is}} still used on four {{mountain}} railways, using 725 to 3000V at 50 or 60Hz: the Corcovado <b>Rack</b> <b>Railway</b> in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Jungfraubahn and Gornergratbahn in Switzerland, and the Petit train de la Rhune in France.|$|E
25|$|In 1811, John Blenkinsop {{patented}} a {{toothed wheel}} and rack rail system. The toothed wheel {{was driven by}} connecting rods, and meshed with a toothed rail at {{one side of the}} track. This was the first <b>rack</b> <b>railway,</b> and had a gauge of 4ft 1½ ins.|$|E

50|$|On rack {{systems with}} extreme gradients, the boiler, cab and general {{superstructure}} of the locomotive are tilted forward {{relative to the}} wheels {{so that they are}} more or less horizontal when on the steeply graded track. These locomotives often cannot function on level track, and so the entire line, including maintenance shops, must be laid on a gradient. This {{is one of the reasons}} why <b>rack</b> <b>railways</b> were among the first to be electrified and most of today's <b>rack</b> <b>railways</b> are electrically powered. In some cases, a vertical boiler can be used that is less sensitive for the track gradient.|$|R
25|$|The exact {{route and}} mode of {{operation}} was initially the subject of intense debate. The Suisse Occidentale-Simplon proposed a pure adhesion line, with a maximum gradient of 4.5%, while the engineer Ernest von Stockalper, who {{was working on the}} construction of the Gotthardbahn, proposed a combined adhesion and <b>rack</b> <b>railway,</b> as originally planned. A Special Commission established to investigate the ideal {{mode of operation}} visited, for the purpose of its investigations, numerous rack railways in Switzerland and Germany, including the Brünigbahn and the Rübelandbahn in the Harz, which was equipped with the Abt rack rail system. These visits led to a decision to equip the line with the system used on the Rübelandbahn, and using a maximum gradient of 12.5%. A total of six sections of track were to be laid out with a total of 7450 m of <b>rack</b> <b>railway.</b>|$|E
25|$|Achaea is {{connected}} to Corinthia, Elis and Attica by the Piraeus, Athens and Peloponnese Railways line Athens - Corinth - Aigio - Patras - Pyrgos - Kyparissia. Passenger service on the section Patras - Kyparissia has been suspended since 2011. The Diakofto–Kalavryta Railway is a <b>rack</b> <b>railway,</b> offering passenger service as well.|$|E
25|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{steam locomotive}} was Matthew Murray's rack locomotive Salamanca {{built for the}} Middleton Railway in Leeds in 1812. This twin-cylinder locomotive was not heavy enough to break the edge-rails track and solved the problem of adhesion by a cog-wheel using teeth cast {{on the side of}} one of the rails. Thus it was also the first <b>rack</b> <b>railway.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} rack systems have been developed. With the exception of some early Morgan and Blenkinsop rack installations, rack systems place the rack rail halfway between the running rails. Today, most <b>rack</b> <b>railways</b> use the Abt system.|$|R
25|$|An inquiry {{concluded}} that the accident had been triggered by post-construction settlement, compounded by excess speed due to {{the weight of the}} train. As a result of the inquiry's recommendations the maximum allowed train weight was reduced to the equivalent of 1½ carriages, leading to lighter carriages being bought and used on two-carriage trains. A gripper system was also installed on the <b>rack</b> <b>railway.</b>|$|E
25|$|The track {{follows the}} eastern {{waterside}} from the Melide causeway to Capolago-Riva San Vitale station. Here interchange {{is made with}} the Monte Generoso railway, a <b>rack</b> <b>railway</b> to the summit of Monte Generoso. The Gotthard line then continues to Mendrisio and Chiasso. Chiasso station houses the border controls and has a large international marshalling yard. Conventional trains change locomotives here due to different traction voltages and train protection systems in Italy.|$|E
25|$|After the war it was {{eventually}} {{decided to build}} a suspended cable car line from a point close to the intended start point of the previously planned <b>rack</b> <b>railway.</b> The line was privately built and owned, opening on 17 July 1930 {{after three years of}} construction. It was built to Professor Benoit's design, using one carrying cable and two traction cables. There were 10 cabins, a maximum of 8 of which could be used at any time, and each cabin carried up to 22 passengers and a conductor.|$|E

25|$|In 1893 Leeds {{had been}} granted city status. These {{industries}} that developed in the industrial revolution had included making machinery for spinning, machine tools, steam engines and gears {{as well as other}} industries based on textiles, chemicals and leather and pottery. Coal was extracted on a large scale and the still functioning Middleton Railway, the first successful commercial steam locomotive railway in the world, transported coal into the centre of Leeds. The track was the first <b>rack</b> <b>railway</b> and the locomotive (Salamanca) was the first to have twin cylinders.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} years of the 20th century, several {{proposals}} were made to link Freiburg to Schauinsland. The extension of city tram route 2 on segregated track to Günterstal in 1913 was intended as the first section of a high speed tramway that would connect with a proposed <b>rack</b> <b>railway</b> to the mountain's summit. Other proposals included an aerial cableway, proposed by Professor Georg Benoit of the University of Karlsruhe, and a much longer adhesion railway from Freiburg Hauptbahnhof via Schauinsland to Todtnau. The outbreak of the First World War stopped any further progress on these plans.|$|E
25|$|Most level {{crossings}} (Bahnübergang in German, “passage à niveau” in French, “passaggi a livello” in Italian) in Switzerland have two red {{lights on the}} bottom of a triangle backboard, bells, barriers, and more rarely, another triangle with one red light in the middle. When activated, each red light flashes for a third of a second. The bells ring as well. After a few seconds, the barriers come down and the bells stop ringing. Most Swiss crossings are automatic and a few are also on <b>rack</b> <b>railway</b> systems, so they have rising teeth that come out from the ground.|$|E

50|$|The Schneeberg Railway (Schneebergbahn) is one {{of three}} <b>rack</b> <b>railways</b> in Austria still operating, and runs from the small town of Puchberg am Schneeberg in Lower Austria up to a plateau beneath the Schneeberg summit. At 2076 m, the Schneeberg is the highest {{mountain}} in Lower Austria. The other two working cog railways in Austria are the Schafberg Railway (opened in 1893) and the Achensee Railway (opened in 1889).|$|R
50|$|<b>Rack</b> <b>railways</b> are {{mountain}} railways {{that use}} a rack {{built into the}} center of the track and a pinion on their locomotives. This allows them to work on steep gradients, up to 45 degrees, as opposed to conventional railways which rely on friction alone for locomotion. Additionally, the rack and pinion addition provides these trains with controlled brakes, and reduces the effects of snow or ice on the rails.|$|R
25|$|Zermatt is a {{starting}} point for hikes into the mountains, including the Haute Route that leads to Chamonix in France and the Patrouille des Glaciers. Cable cars and chair lifts carry skiers in the winter and hikers in the summer; the highest of them leads to the Klein Matterhorn at , a peak on the ridge between Breithorn and Matterhorn that offers spectacular views in all directions. It is possible to cross into Italy via the Cervinia cable car station. A spectacular <b>rack</b> <b>railway</b> line (the Gornergratbahn, the highest open-air railway in Europe) runs up to the summit of the Gornergrat at 3,089m (10,134ft). Zermatt is also the western terminus for the Glacier Express rail service connecting to St. Moritz and the MGB (Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn).|$|E
