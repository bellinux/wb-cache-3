5|$|Recent <b>research</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mongol forces most {{probably}} never reached Pagan. They {{were held at}} bay by the Burmese defenses led by commanders Athinkhaya, Yazathingyan and Thihathu, and probably never got closer than 160km north of Pagan. (An inscription dated 16 February 1293 by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the Mongol army.) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. At any rate, the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties, and retreated north to Tagaung. They remained there as the treaty was now void.|$|E
5|$|The other {{text that}} seems to support the case for Arthur's {{historical}} existence is the 10th-century Annales Cambriae, which also link Arthur with the Battle of Badon. The Annales date this battle to 516–518, and also mention the Battle of Camlann, in which Arthur and Medraut (Mordred) were both killed, dated to 537–539. These details have often been used to bolster confidence in the Historias account and to confirm that Arthur really did fight at Badon. Problems have been identified, however, with using this source to support the Historia Brittonums account. The latest <b>research</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Annales Cambriae {{was based on a}} chronicle begun in the late 8th century in Wales. Additionally, the complex textual history of the Annales Cambriae precludes any certainty that the Arthurian annals were added to it even that early. They were more likely added {{at some point in the}} 10th century and may never have existed in any earlier set of annals. The Badon entry probably derived from the Historia Brittonum.|$|E

25|$|Another {{of their}} {{rejected}} hypotheses is the 'choosing victim' rape-adaptation hypothesis {{which suggests that}} there is an evolved victim-preference mechanism to maximise the reproductive benefits of rape.

However, this explanation does not explain the rape of those with no chance of reproductive success e.g. girls, boys, adult males, and post-menopausal women.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that {{immigration to the}} United States is beneficial to the US economy.

25|$|Reduction of {{the area}} of Arctic sea ice reduces the planet's average albedo, {{possibly}} resulting in global warming in a positive feedback mechanism. <b>Research</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Arctic may become ice free {{for the first time}} in human history within a few years or by 2040.

25|$|Brachiosaurus is the namesake genus of {{the family}} Brachiosauridae, which {{includes}} {{a handful of other}} similar sauropods. Much of what is known by laypeople about Brachiosaurus is in fact based on Giraffatitan brancai, a species of brachiosaurid dinosaur from the Tendaguru Formation of Tanzania that was originally described by German paleontologist Werner Janensch as a species of Brachiosaurus. Recent <b>research</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> differences between the type species of Brachiosaurus and the Tendaguru material are significant enough that the African material should be placed in a separate genus. Several other potential species of Brachiosaurus have been described from Africa and Europe, but none of them are thought to belong to Brachiosaurus at this time.|$|E
25|$|Hair of the dog: The {{belief is}} that {{consumption}} of further alcohol after the onset of a hangover will relieve symptoms, based upon {{the theory that the}} hangover represents a form of alcohol withdrawal and that by satiating the body's need for alcohol the symptoms will be relieved. Social drinkers and alcoholics claim that drinking more alcohol gives relief from hangover symptoms, but <b>research</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> use of alcohol as a hangover cure seems to predict current or future problem drinking and alcohol use disorder, through negative reinforcement and the development of physical dependence. While the practice is popular in tradition and promoted by many sellers of alcoholic beverages, medical opinion holds that the practice merely postpones the symptoms, and courts addiction. Favored choices include Fernet Branca and Bloody Mary.|$|E

500|$|Focal {{injuries}} often produce symptoms {{related to}} {{the functions of the}} damaged area. <b>Research</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most common areas to have focal lesions in non-penetrating traumatic brain injury are the orbitofrontal cortex (the lower surface of the frontal lobes) and the anterior temporal lobes, areas that are involved in social behavior, emotion regulation, olfaction, and decision-making, hence the common social/emotional and judgment deficits following moderate-severe TBI.

500|$|In Chaco Canyon, {{the center}} of the ancient Pueblo culture in the American Southwest, {{numerous}} solar and lunar light markings and architectural and road alignments have been documented. These findings date to the 1977 discovery of the Sun Dagger site by Anna Sofaer. Three large stone slabs leaning against a cliff channel light and shadow markings onto two spiral petroglyphs on the cliff wall, marking the solstices, equinoxes and the lunar standstills of the 18.6 year cycle of the moon. Subsequent [...] research by the Solstice Project and others demonstrated [...] that numerous building and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon are oriented to solar, lunar and cardinal directions. In addition, <b>research</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Great North Road, a thirty-five mile engineered “road”, was constructed [...] not for utilitarian purposes but rather to connect the ceremonial center of Chaco Canyon with the direction north.|$|E
500|$|The 20th century saw the {{advancement}} of technologies that improved treatment and diagnosis such as the development of imaging tools including CT and MRI, and, in the 21st century, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

Until the 20thcentury, the mortality rate of TBI was high and rehabilitation was uncommon; improvements in care made during World War I reduced the death rate and made rehabilitation possible. Facilities dedicated to TBI rehabilitation were probably first established during World War I. Explosives used in World War I caused many blast injuries; {{the large number of}} TBIs that resulted allowed researchers to learn about localization of brain functions. [...] Blast-related injuries are now common problems in returning veterans from Iraq & Afghanistan; <b>research</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> symptoms of such TBIs are largely the same as those of TBIs involving a physical blow to the head.|$|E

Decades later, the Nobel Committee publicly declared its regret for the omission, and admitted to deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award. Gandhi was nominated in 1948 but was assassinated before nominations closed. That year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that [...] "there was no suitable living candidate" [...] and later <b>research</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> possibility of awarding the prize posthumously to Gandhi was discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to Gandhi. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, [...] "The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question".
