5|$|Many <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>and</b> {{protective}} {{factors have been}} proposed, sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however, none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence. When epidemiological studies {{have been carried out}} in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD, they have often been flawed and their results have in some cases been contradictory. The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides, and a reduced risk in smokers.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of AML {{are caused by}} replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Several <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>and</b> chromosomal abnormalities have been identified, but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.|$|E

40|$|One {{might expect}} that a {{perception}} of obesity being a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> disease, contributes to effective obesity prevention and management strategies. However, obesity rates continue to increase worldwide. The question arises whether obesity is truly perceived as a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> a disease. This paper aims at describing perception of obesity as <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> disease among individuals seeking care, individuals not seeking care, the society, and different professionals having {{a role in the}} field of obesity. The paper {{is a reflection of the}} lecture on the topic that was given at the EASO’s New Investigators United’s Summer School 2016 in Portugal and the discussion with the new investigators and other senior speakers. Individual obese patients seeking help are very much aware of obesity being a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> disease, but perceptions regarding obesity seem to be flawed among those who do not seek help for obesity. Also, misperceptions regarding obesity play a role at different levels, including society, different political levels, the fields of health care and social work, prevention organizations, and the food and marketing industry. The food and marketing industry has an enormous role in changing perceptions by the society and policy makers. Obesity rates will continue to increase as long as individuals, the society, and professionals at different levels have false interpretations of the severity of obesity. Severe action is needed against those who are playing a role in maintaining false perceptions of obesity as a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> disease...|$|R
5|$|There is {{controversy}} as {{to whether}} VAD {{is more common in}} men or in women; an aggregate of all studies shows that it is slightly higher incidence in men (56% versus 44%). Men are on average 37–44 years old at diagnosis, and women 34–44. While dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries accounts for only 2% of strokes (which are usually caused by high blood pressure and other <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>and</b> tend to occur in the elderly), they cause 10–25% of strokes in young and middle-aged people.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>and</b> one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} {{is usually}} diagnosed by {{a health care}} provider after consideration of a person's presenting history, <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>and</b> clinical examination. Tenderness to palpation along the inner aspect of the heel bone on the {{sole of the foot}} may be elicited during the physical examination. The foot may have limited dorsiflexion due to tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E

40|$|Oxidative stress plays a {{critical}} role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in patients with metabolic syndrome. This study aimed to investigate whether a relationship exists between phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity and oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in metabolic syndrome patients. The study was performed in 56 metabolic syndrome patients (metabolic syndrome group), 99 patients with one or two cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> (cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> group), <b>and</b> 28 healthy subjects (control group). NADPH oxidase expression and activity was augmented (P < 0. 05) in metabolic syndrome compared with cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> control groups. Insulin was enhanced (P < 0. 05) in metabolic syndrome patients compared with cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> control groups and correlated with NADPH oxidase activity in the overall population. Insulin stimulated NADPH oxidase activity; this effect was abolished by a specific protein kinase C inhibitor. Oxidized LDL and nitrotyrosine levels and carotid intima-media thickness were increased (P < 0. 05) in the metabolic syndrome group compared with cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> control groups and correlated with NADPH oxidase activity in the overall population. These findings suggest that phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity is involved in oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in metabolic syndrome patients.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to test the {{validity of}} Fama-French Three-Factor Model in banking stocks listed on Jakarta Composite Index. This study also shows the average monthly returns behavior based on the portfolios constructed according to firm size and book-to-market ratio. Three-factor model is empirically compared to one-factor model (CAPM). This study uses multiple linear regression on time-series data in estimating the effects of three variables (market <b>risk</b> <b>factor,</b> size <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> book-to-market ratio <b>risk</b> <b>factor)</b> on excess portfolio returns. The data used in this analysis are monthly stock returns, monthly market returns and risk-free rate in the period of February 2008 to January 2014. Average monthly portfolio returns calculated from February 2008 to January 2014 show a positive relation between average return and both firm size and book-to-market ratio. Market <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> size <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> significantly affect the excess returns on four portfolios constructed according to firm size and book-to-market equity ratio.

25|$|By {{identifying}} {{risk factors}} present {{within a community}} and creating solutions to decrease the incidence of injury, trauma referral systems may help to enhance the overall health of a population. Injury prevention strategies are commonly used to prevent injuries in children, who are a high risk population. Injury prevention strategies generally involve educating the general public about specific <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>and</b> developing strategies to avoid or reduce injuries. Legislation intended to prevent injury typically involves seatbelts, child car-seats, helmets, alcohol control, and increased enforcement of the legislation. Other controllable factors, {{such as the use}} of drugs including alcohol or cocaine, increases the risk of trauma by increasing the likelihood of traffic collisions, violence, and abuse occurring. Prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines may increase the risk of trauma in elderly people.|$|E

25|$|Staging is {{generally}} by the UICC/AJCC TNM (Tumour, Nodes, Metastases) system. HPV+OPC {{has been treated}} similarly to stage-matched and site-matched HPV unrelated OPC, but its unique features, which contrast smoking-related HPV-OPC head and neck cancers, for which patients' demographics, comorbidities, <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>and</b> carcinogenesis differ markedly, suggest that a distinct staging system be developed to more appropriately represent {{the severity of the}} disease and its prognosis. Standard AJCC TNM staging, such as the seventh edition (2009) while predictive for HPV-OPC has no prognostic value in HPV+OPC. The 8th edition of the AJCC TNM Staging Manual (2016) incorporates this specific staging for HPV+OPC. Current treatment guidelines do not account for the different outcomes observed in HPV+OPC. Consequently, less intensive (de-intensification) use of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, as well as specific therapy, is under investigation, enrolling HPV+OPC in clinical trials to preserve disease control and minimise morbidity in selected groups based on modified TNM staging and smoking status.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{approaches}} {{refer to}} the overall 'architecture' or 'meta-structure', particularly {{in relation to the}} development of the DSM or ICD systems. Five proposed meta-structure groupings were recently proposed in this way, based on views and evidence relating to <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>and</b> clinical presention. The clusters of disorder that emerged were described as neurocognitive (identified mainly by neural substrate abnormalities), neurodevelopmental (identified mainly by early and continuing cognitive deficits), psychosis (identified mainly by clinical features and biomarkers for information processing deficits), emotional (identified mainly by being preceded by a temperament of negative emotionality), and externalizing (identified mainly be being preceded by disinhibition). However, the analysis was not necessarily able to validate one arrangement over others. From a psychological point of view, it has been suggested that the underlying phenomena are too complex, inter-related and continuous– with too poorly understood a biological or environmental basis– to expect that everything can be mapped into a set of categories for all purposes. In this context the overall system of classification is to some extent arbitrary, and could be thought of as a user inferface which may need to satisfy different purposes.|$|E
