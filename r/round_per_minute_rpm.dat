50|$|The AK-230 gun was a fully automatic, stabilized, NN-30 double-barrel, water-cooled, four-chamber {{revolver}} cannon. The guns had a 1,000 <b>round</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm)</b> rate of {{fire and}} were fed by independent 500 round ammunition belts. The regular associated radar system was the (NATO codename) DRUM TILT radar, which was not used in the Parchim class. According to some sources the AK-230 could not only be linked with the DRUM TILT {{but also with the}} MUFF COB radar system, but this is disputed by old East German naval sources. According to these East German sources, the AK-230 gun on the Parchim-class corvette was optically guided, thereby leaving the Parchim class without an effective CIWS, and therefore unable to counter anti-shipping missiles.|$|E
50|$|The fully {{automatic}} {{rate of fire}} of the cancelled prototype model of the AK-12 is around 600-650 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM)</b> but on the three-round burst feature, it fires at 1,000 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM).</b>|$|R
50|$|The M240D {{is issued}} for {{aircraft}} configuration. The barrel assembly contains a three position gas plug. The first gas plug position allows the weapon to cycle at 650-750 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM),</b> the second gas plug positions allows the weapon to fire at 750-850 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM),</b> {{and the third}} gas plug position allows the weapon to fire at 850-950 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM).</b> The aircraft configured M240D weighs 25.6 lb (11.6 kg) and is 42.3 in (1074.42 mm) long, while the egress configuration weighs 26.2 lb (11.9 kg) and is 49 in (1244.6 mm) long.|$|R
50|$|The travel {{distance}} of the reciprocating parts of the AEK-971 is less than compared to the non-balanced recoil AK-pattern designs, thus increasing its cyclic rate of fire significantly. The original cyclic rate of fire of the early prototype model was 1,500 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM)</b> and was later decreased to 900 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM)</b> for the production model.|$|R
50|$|It has a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 650 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM).</b>|$|R
50|$|The MP7 has a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 950 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM).</b>|$|R
50|$|The AUG has a cyclic {{rate of fire}} {{of around}} 680-750 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{manufacturer}} {{claims that}} the Pecheneg can fire 600 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM)</b> in continuous sustained fire without any danger to the barrel and its practical sustained rate of fire is 250 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rate of fire is the {{frequency}} {{at which a}} specific weapon can fire or launch its projectiles. It is usually measured in <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM</b> or round/min), or <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> second (RPS or round/s).|$|R
50|$|The Mk 16 has {{a rate of}} fire of 625 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM)</b> and the Mk 17 has a rate of fire of 600 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> This {{was done}} to improve the control during fully {{automatic}} fire.|$|R
5000|$|The Uzi Submachine Gun is a {{standard}} Uzi with a 10 in barrel. It has a rate of automatic fire of 600 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm)</b> when chambered in 9mm Parabellum; the [...]45 ACP model's rate of fire is slower at 500 rpm.|$|R
50|$|The AK-12 and AK-15 have {{a firing}} rate of 700 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM),</b> which is 50-100 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> {{faster than the}} older Kalashnikov assault rifles and the {{cancelled}} prototypes of the AK-12. The three-round burst feature from the prototype model {{was replaced by a}} two-round burst feature in the final production model.|$|R
50|$|Garwood Industries {{created the}} M134G version with several {{modifications}} to the original GE system. The optimum rate of fire was determined by Garwood to be around 3,200 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm).</b> The M134G is being produced with this firing rate as well as 4,000 rpm and the previous standard 3,000 rpm rate.|$|R
50|$|The KRISS Vector {{uses the}} KRISS Super V Recoil Mitigation System, {{that is an}} {{articulated}} mechanism which allows the bolt and an inertia block to move downward into a recess behind the magazine well. The theory {{is that at the}} end of this travel, the energy is transmitted downward rather than rearward, thus reducing the felt recoil. When fired, the barrel axis is in line with the shoulder as in the M16 rifle, but also in line with the shooter's hand. This is intended to reduce muzzle climb when combined with the off-axis bolt travel, though it also greatly raise the sight line in comparison to the bore axis. The initial prototype model by TDI achieved a rate of fire of 1,500 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM),</b> though this was bought down to around 1,200 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM)</b> on the production models.|$|R
50|$|The M240N is {{designed}} with a {{front and rear}} sights, and configured specifically for mounting on water craft. It {{is similar to the}} M240G, but lacks the integral bipod. It also uses the hydraulic buffer of the M240B, and features the lower cyclic rate of fire of the M240B which is around 550-650 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM).</b>|$|R
50|$|The MSBS-5.56 is a {{selective}} fire modular assault rifle which {{is capable of}} semi-automatic fire, 3-round burst fire and fully automatic fire. The MSBS-5.56K and MSBS-5.56B have a cyclic rate of fire of around 700-900 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM).</b> They have many common interchangeable parts and can be converted {{from one to the}} other.|$|R
25|$|Green Mace was the Rainbow Code {{assigned}} to the QF 127/58 SBT X1 during its development. The original specifications were for a 5-inch gun with water-cooled barrel, firing folding-fin discarding sabot dart projectiles. Two rotary magazines, each holding 14 rounds, would allow for {{a high rate of}} fire on the order of 75 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM).</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1946, the Army issued General Electric a {{contract}} for [...] "Project Vulcan", a six-barrel weapon capable of firing 7,200 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm).</b> Although European designers were moving towards heavier 30 mm weapons for better hitting power, the U.S. initially concentrated on a powerful 0.60 in cartridge designed for a pre-war anti-tank rifle, expecting that the cartridge's high muzzle velocity would be beneficial for improving hit ratios on high speed targets.|$|R
50|$|The final {{production}} {{model of the}} AK-12 5.45×39mm assault rifle {{is said to be}} more reliable, more accurate and better suited to the latest Russian military requirements. It is based from the well proven AK-400 (Base Prototype) and it is chambered in 5.45×39mm cartridge. It has a firing rate of 700 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM),</b> a barrel length of 415 mm, a maximum firing range of 800 m and a standard magazine capacity of 30 rounds. It is also compatible with the magazines from the AK-74, RPK-74 and the 96-round drum magazine from the RPK-16.|$|R
50|$|Production-standard {{armament}} {{consisted of}} a 20 mm HS.404, which had an ammunition capacity of 60 rounds, firing through the propeller hub, and four belt-fed MAC 1934 M39 7.5 mm (.295 in) machine guns in the wings, each with 675 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> gun. The MAC 1934 machine guns had {{a high rate of}} fire of 1,200 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm),</b> while the effective HS.404 fired at 600 rpm and was accurate up to 500 m; the ammunition capacity meant that the machine guns could be fired for a total of 30 seconds, while the cannon had six seconds worth of ammunition.|$|R
5000|$|A {{total of}} 3,700 M42s were built. The vehicle has {{a crew of}} six and weighs 22,500 kg (49,500 lb) fully loaded. Maximum speed is 45 mph {{with a range of}} 100 miles (160 km). Armament {{consists}} of fully automatic twin 40 mm M2A1 Bofors, with a rate of fire of 2×120 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm)</b> and either a [...]30 caliber Browning M1919A4 or 7.62mm M60 machine gun. The 500 hp, six-cylinder, Continental (or Lycoming Engines), air-cooled, gasoline engine is located {{in the rear of the}} vehicle. It was driven by a cross-drive, two-speed Allison transmission.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} 37 mm gun {{was developed}} by Rheinmetall in 1935 as the 3.7 cm Flak 18. It had a barrel length of 57 calibers (hence the additional designation L/57), which allowed 4800 m maximum ceiling. The armour penetration was considerable when using dedicated ammunition, at 100 m distance it could penetrate 36 mm of a 60°-sloped armour, and at 800 m distance correspondingly 24 mm. It used a mechanical bolt for automatic fire, featuring a practical rate of fire of about 80 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm).</b> The gun, when emplaced for combat, weighed 1750 kg, and complete for transport, including the wheeled mount, 3560 kg.|$|R
50|$|The M240H (formerly {{designated}} as the M240E5) is an improvement of the M240D, the M240H features a rail-equipped feed cover, an improved flash suppressor, and has been configured {{so that it can}} be more quickly converted to infantry standard using an Egress Kit. The M240H has an overall length of 41.6 in (1056.6 mm) with a 21.7 in (551.2 mm) barrel and weighs 26.3 lb empty, and has a rate of fire of 550-650 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM).</b> The M240H entered service in 2004 on U.S. Army helicopters. It is equipped with dual spade grips and thumb-activated trigger systems, and can be quickly converted for dismounted infantry use via an egress components kit that includes a bipod and conventional pistol grip trigger module.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{production}} {{model of the}} AK-15 7.62×39mm assault rifle has been developed by the Kalashnikov Group under the [...] "Ratnik" [...] program and it is planned to replace the AK-103 assault rifle. It is based from the well proven AK-400 (Base Prototype) and it is chambered in 7.62×39mm cartridge. It has a combat weight of 4.16 kg, a full length of 1066 mm, a barrel length of 415 mm, a firing rate of 700 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM),</b> a muzzle velocity of 715 m/s, a maximum firing range of 800 m meters and a standard magazine capacity of 30 rounds. It is also compatible with the magazines from the AKM, AK-103 and the RPK. The only difference between the AK-12 and the AK-15 is their caliber.|$|R
30|$|The {{circulation}} {{within the}} flow chamber was generated by an externally attached electric motor, which rotates up to 500 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm).</b> A commercial grade 4 pure medical titanium gear shaft (length[*]=[*] 40  mm, diameter[*]=[*] 4  mm) {{was connected to}} the motor by a set screw-fixed gearwheel. For the attachment of the custom-made biocompatible glass panel (diameter[*]=[*] 60  mm, thickness[*]=[*] 2  mm; 4 -mm central circular opening), the gear shafts’ lower end was disc shaped (diameter[*]=[*] 10  mm). The glass panel was fixed by an adjusting ring with an additional set screw from above. The cover of the lower petri dish contained guiding grooves to stabilise an inverted larger petri dish placed on, which in turn served as a holding device to the electric motor (Fig.  1).|$|R
25|$|The Avenger's rate of {{fire was}} {{originally}} selectable, 2,100 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm)</b> in the low setting, or 4,200 rpm in the high setting. Later this was changed to a fixed rate of 3,900 rpm. In practice, the cannon is limited to one and two-second bursts to avoid overheating and conserve ammunition; barrel life is also a factor, since the USAF has specified a minimum life of at least 20,000 rounds for each set of barrels. There is no technical limitation on the duration the gun may be continuously fired, and a pilot could potentially expend the entire ammunition load in a single burst with no damage or ill effects to the weapons system itself. However, this constant {{rate of fire}} would shorten the barrel life considerably and require added barrel inspections and result in shorter intervals between replacement.|$|R
5000|$|F88: The F88 Austeyr is the {{standard}} individual weapon of the Australia Defence Force. It is manufactured under licence from Steyr Mannlicher AG at the Thales Lithgow Small Arms Factory, which is now owned by Thales Australia. It is issued and supplied to {{the armed forces of}} Australia and New Zealand and incorporate a cross hair donut sight, it is also in service in 30 different countries. There are changes and differences between the Austrian version and the Australian version. The changes for the Australian version includes a bayonet lug, a 1:7 in rifling pitch as found in the M16A2 assault rifle, optimized for the heavier 62-grain NATO-standard SS109/M855 round and an [...] "automatic lockout" [...] selector that can physically disable the fully automatic position of the two-stage trigger mechanism found on {{the standard}} AUG. It has a cyclic rate of fire of around 680-850 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM).</b> It also won a competition against the prototype of what would become the Bushmaster M17S.|$|R
2500|$|In 1933, {{the chief}} {{engineer}} of Hispano-Suiza, Marc Birkigt, began work {{on the design of}} an entirely new weapon to replace the Oerlikon contract, based on a locking mechanism patented in 1919 by the American machine-gun designer Carl Swebilius. The result was the Type 404, or HS.404. While the HS.404 resembled the parent Oerlikon FF S in many respects, its repeating mechanism was a gas-operated locking bolt. [...] On firing the 404, when the projectile passes a hole cut into the barrel about half way along its length hot gas behind the projectile is siphoned off and enters a chamber. Inside the chamber is a piston that presses on a rod running {{along the top of the}} barrel back to the bolt, unlocking it and allowing it and the spent cartridge to move backwards. Since the bolt was locked during firing, it could be lighter than that of the Oerlikon, thus facilitating an increase in rate of fire to 700 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm),</b> a gain of about 200 rpm. In 1938, Birkigt patented it and started production in their Geneva factory.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{versions}} of the Thompson, the Model 1919, had a fairly high cyclic rate of fire, as high as 1,200 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm),</b> with most Model 1921s at 800 rpm. In 1927, the U.S. Navy ordered 500 Thompsons but requested a lower rate of fire. Thompson requested Payne develop a method of reducing the cyclic rate of fire. Payne replaced the actuator with a heavier one and the recoil spring with a stiffer one; the changes reduced the rate of fire from 800 to the 600 rpm of the U.S. Navy Model 1928. Later M1 and M1A1 Thompsons averaged also 600 rpm. This rate of fire, combined with a rather heavy trigger pull and a stock with an excessive drop, increases the tendency for the barrel to climb off target in automatic fire. Compared to modern 9mm submachine guns, the [...]45 Thompson is quite heavy, weighing roughly {{the same as the}} contemporary M1 Garand semi-automatic rifle, and requires lots of cleaning. This was one of the major complaints against the weapon made by service members of the U.S. Army issued the Thompson.|$|R
5000|$|The Bren was a gas-operated weapon, {{which used}} the same [...]303 {{ammunition}} as the standard British bolt-action rifle, the Lee-Enfield, firing {{at a rate of}} between 480 and 540 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm),</b> depending on the model. Propellant gases vented from a port towards the muzzle end of the barrel through a regulator (visible in the photo, {{just in front of the}} bipod) with four quick-adjustment apertures of different sizes, intended to tailor the gas volume to different ambient temperatures (smallest flow at high temperature, e.g. summer desert, largest at low temperature, e.g. winter Arctic). The vented gas drove a piston which in turn actuated the breech block. Each gun came with a spare barrel that could be quickly changed when the barrel became hot during sustained fire, though later guns featured a chrome-lined barrel which reduced the need for a spare. To change barrels, the release catch in front of the magazine was rotated to unlock the barrel. The carrying handle above the barrel was used to grip and remove the hot barrel without burning the hands.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Fusil Ametrellador Systema Mendoza" [...] Model 1934 is an air-cooled, magazine-fed, gas-operated {{light machine}} gun {{weighing}} approximately 18.5 lb. The design features a quick-detachable barrel with 39 radial cooling fins, a flash hider and a bipod. The top-mounted, 20-or 30-round box magazine is offset to the right, allowing the sights to be centered. The rotating bolt has eight locking lugs in three rows that lock directly to the steel receiver. The gas system is fed from an adjustable gas port 11 inches {{from the rear of}} the barrel. Gas flows through a tube in the gas port where it impinges on the recessed face of the piston, which forms part of the operating rod assembly. Cyclic firing rate is 380 to 550 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM)</b> depending on the gas system setting. Designers consider that while the Mendoza borrows much from both the Lewis and the Hotchkiss machine guns, the Model 1934 is a first-class design in its own right. In many ways, the Mendoza Model 1934 is what the American BAR should have been.|$|R
5000|$|The RPK {{also has}} a {{slightly}} longer receiver, by about 20 mm or less. This was done to decrease the fire rate slightly, but not significantly enough to lower it any less than 600 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM).</b> The U-shaped receiver is stamped from a smooth 1.5 mm sheet of steel (compared to the 1.0 mm sheet metal receiver used on the standard AKM rifles. It uses a modified AKM recoil spring assembly, that consists of a rear spring guide rod from the AK and a new forward flat guide rod and coil spring. It features a thick laminated wood foregrip, and a fixed laminated wood [...] "club-foot" [...] buttstock, similar to the stock used on the RPD, {{which is designed to}} allow the user to fire from the prone position more comfortably. It uses a standard AKM pistol grip and can also use standard AKM detachable box magazines, but it is most commonly used with a 40-round box magazine or a 75-round drum magazine. Interchangeability of parts between the RPK and AKM are moderate.|$|R
50|$|The RPK-16 5.45×39mm {{light machine}} gun/squad {{automatic}} weapon is a modernization of the RPK-74 {{and is expected}} to take over its role in the Russian Armed Forces. It is based on the traditional Kalashnikov layout and design, it also has several novel technical and ergonomic features derived from the AK-12 program. It is chambered in 5.45×39mm cartridge and uses a Picatinny rail mounted detachable bipod instead of the fixed bipod of the RPK-74. It features the traditional Kalashnikov gas-operated long-stroke piston system, a detachable suppressor, a Picatinny rail on the top of its receiver for mounting various optics/scopes and {{on the bottom of the}} handguard for bipod mounting, an ergonomic pistol grip and a folding buttstock and two main barrel lengths; a 550 mm long barrel (when it is configured/applied for the light machine gun/squad automatic weapon role) and a 370 mm short barrel (when it is configured/applied for the assault weapon role). Its design enables it to have an interchangeable barrel, that can easily be removed. It has a combat weight of 6 kg, a full length of 1076 mm, a firing rate of 700 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM),</b> an accuracy range of 800 m and uses a standard 96-round drum magazine. It is also compatible with the magazines from the AK-74 and RPK-74.|$|R
50|$|The gun is fed by 152 {{ready to}} fire rounds and has {{selectable}} rates of fire of 30, 60 and 120 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> The 120 <b>r.p.m.</b> rate {{is achieved by}} firing a burst of 75, but afterwards the gun has to cool off for 30 minutes. The AK-176 is effective against missiles, being able to shoot down AT-2 Swatter (simulating a Harpoon anti-ship missile), taking an average of 25 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> kill.|$|R
5000|$|By 1893, the Gatling {{was adapted}} {{to take the}} new [...]30 Army {{smokeless}} cartridge. The new M1893 guns featured six barrels, later increased to ten barrels, and were capable of a maximum (initial) rate of fire of 800-900 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> though 600 <b>rpm</b> was recommended for continuous fire. Dr. Gatling later used examples of the M1893 powered by electric motor and belt to drive the crank. [...] Tests demonstrated the electric Gatling could fire bursts of up to 1,500 rpm.|$|R
