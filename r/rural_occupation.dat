It is quite true that a thresher {{is likely to be}} innocent of any adroit arithmetical cheating, but he is not the less likely to carry home his master’s corn in his shoes and pocket; a reaper is not given to writing begging-letters, but he is quite capable of cajoling the dairymaid into filling his small-beer bottle with ale.

60|$|In <b>rural</b> <b>occupation,</b> {{there is}} nothing mean and debasing. It leads a man forth among scenes of natural {{grandeur}} and beauty; it leaves him to the workings of his own mind, operated upon by the purest and most elevating of external influences. Such a man may be simple and rough, but he cannot be vulgar. The man of refinement, therefore, finds nothing revolting in an intercourse with the lower orders in rural life, as he does when he casually mingles with the lower orders of cities. He lays aside his distance and reserve, and is glad to waive the distinctions of rank, and {{to enter into the}} honest, heartfelt enjoyments of common life. Indeed, the very amusements of the country bring, men more and more together; and the sound hound and horn blend all feelings into harmony. I believe this is one great reason why the nobility and gentry are more popular among the inferior orders in England than they are in any other country; and why the latter have endured so many excessive pressures and extremities, without repining more generally at the unequal distribution of fortune and privilege.|$|E
60|$|The English, in fact, are {{strongly}} gifted with the rural feeling. They possess a quick sensibility to the beauties of nature, and a keen relish for the pleasures and employments of the country. This passion seems inherent in them. Even {{the inhabitants of}} cities, born and brought up among brick walls and bustling streets, enter with facility into rural habits, and evince a tact for <b>rural</b> <b>occupation.</b> The merchant has his snug retreat {{in the vicinity of}} the metropolis, where he often displays as much pride and zeal in the cultivation of his flower-garden, and the maturing of his fruits, as he does in the conduct of his business, and the success of a commercial enterprise. Even those less fortunate individuals, who are doomed to pass their lives in the midst of din and traffic, contrive to have something that shall remind them of the green aspect of nature. In the most dark and dingy quarters of the city, the drawing-room window resembles frequently a bank of flowers; every spot capable of vegetation has its grass-plot and flower-bed; and every square its mimic park, laid out with picturesque taste, and gleaming with refreshing verdure.|$|E

It requires no common exertion of good sense and philosophy in persons of elevated rank to keep a friendship properly alive with one much their inferior. Externals, things wholly extraneous of the man, steal upon the hearts and judgments of almost, if not altogether, all mankind; nor do I know more than one instance of a man who fully regards all the world as a stage and all the men and women merely players, and who (the dancing-school bow excepted) only values these players, the dramatis personæ who build cities and who rear hedges, who govern provinces or superintend flocks, merely as they act their parts. For the honour of Ayrshire this man is Professor Dugald Stewart of Catrine. To him I might perhaps add another instance, a Popish bishop, Geddes of Edinburgh.... I ever could ill endure those ... beasts of prey who foul the hallowed ground of religion with their nocturnal prowlings; and if the prosecution against my worthy friend, Dr. McGill, goes on, I shall keep no measure with the savages, but fly at them with the faucons of ridicule, or run them down with the bloodhounds of satire as lawful game wherever I start them.|$|E

In 125-124 hostilities broke out once more between the Romans and the Salyes from the same cause.

40|$|An {{integrated}} approach to temporary migration in develoing countries is proposed by linking past urban labour-force experience to postreturn entrepreneurial activities.

On {{the basis of an}} in-depth survey of returned migrants that was conducted in rural China, I focus on the explanation of return <b>rural</b> <b>occupation</b> change in a multivariate framework. I find that it is the improvement of the migrant's skills and entrepreneurial ability rather than their savings and remittances that strongly facilitates a return rural occupational change. The policy implication of the finding is to shift efforts from narrowing intersectoral wage differentials to improving rural learning and training opportunities. ...|$|E

40|$|Wool {{handling}} is {{an important}} <b>rural</b> <b>occupation</b> where workers process 200 or more fleeces daily, separating them into various quality components. Loads and postures they experience carry substantial risk of low back pain (LBP). Although a formal skill training structure exists, interaction with loads and LBP is unknown. We examined whether skill and LBP influenced trunk postures and loads of 60 wool handlers representing 3 skill levels. LBP prevalence ranged from 20 % for junior (lowest skill) to 45 % for open class (highest skill) wool handlers. Open class wool handlers demonstrated increased lateral bend and more axially twisted postures, generating greater medio-lateral shear forces and lateral bend and axial twist moments. LBP was associated with open class wool handlers spending more time in severe axially twisted postures. These findings suggest that skill-based training needs to be reviewed to reduce the quantity of axially twisted posture which may help reduce the prevalence of LBP in this workforce. Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) driven Rural Development {{applications}} {{specially in}} the era of rural agricultural development, in the recent past have demonstrated the important role the Information and computing Technologies play in the realm of improving {{the quality of life of}} the rural workforce. Large number of rural development projects have attempted to improve the reach, minimize the processing costs, increase transparency enhance the information sources, and reduce the cycle times. Studies and research of the group SAGGEZZA indicates that those significant efforts are required to design, develop, internalize and maintain the ICT solutions through well managed infrastructure and support in order to ensure the sustainability. One way to achieve the sustainable platform is to develop a cumulative effort with several components each addressing an important, non trivial and yet independent problem faced by the rural workforce rather than implementing single components.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the identification of}} <b>rural</b> <b>occupation</b> and the changing settlement pattern during late antiquity in {{the central part of}} Adriatic Italy. Archaeological field survey have proven to be the most efficient tool to map ancient settlement patterns on a regional scale. Although the methodological approach to map and classify Roman rural settlements has undergone many advances over the years, the identification of Late Roman occupation and the evaluation of the data remain problematic. Recent survey work in the Potenza Valley (Picenum) provides an excellent case study, demonstrating the problems and pit-falls connected with the identification of Late Roman rural settlements. To optimize site detection, the Potenza Valley Survey project invested in the exhaustive analysis of diagnostic finds from stratified contexts of the Roman colony Potentia. Following the study of the surface scatters, the settlements were classified according to a site typology, creating a third dimension in the detected occupation pattern. Broader historical questions could be addressed by integrating the survey results into a wider framework, making use of information from excavated sites and written documents. This approach allowed us to sketch the particularities of the central Adriatic countryside during late antiquity, demonstrating the relevance of regional diversity within this period of transformation...|$|E
