40|$|The present project assembles and {{analyzes}} {{health systems}} data for small areas in contiguous regions of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Poland in 1988. The {{data were collected}} and maintained by the Communist central governments of East Germany and Czechoslovakia, and by the voivodships in Poland during the command system era. Analyses of these regions are compared to contemporary data from U. S. regions. Instead of assuming a common goal for each region, the data are studied to ascertain whether they reflect an identifiable, de facto goal. The key findings are that coefficients of variation of health care resource availability are somewhat larger in the command systems; and coefficients of variation in mortality rates are smaller {{in two of the}} command systems, suggesting a de facto emphasis on health status equality. The U. S. regions' data appear to be more consistent with an implicit goal of <b>regional</b> <b>health</b> <b>status</b> maximization. Discussions explain the relationships between the alternative goals and suggest which systems succeed in achieving a particular goal. ...|$|E

40|$|Reliable, {{comparable}} {{information about}} the main causes of disease and injury in populations, and how these are changing, is a critical input for debates about priorities in the health sector. Traditional sources of {{information about the}} descriptive epidemiology of diseases, injuries and risk factors are generally incomplete, fragmented and of uncertain reliability and comparability. Lack of a standardized measurement framework to permit comparisons across diseases and injuries, as well as risk factors, and failure to systematically evaluate data quality have impeded comparative analyses of the true public health importance of various conditions and risk factors. As a consequence the impact of major conditions and hazards on population health has been poorly appreciated, often leading to a lack of public health investment. Global disease and risk factor quantification improved dramatically in the early 1990 s with the completion of the first Global Burden of Disease Study. For the first time, the comparative importance of over 100 diseases and injuries, and ten major risk factors, for global and <b>regional</b> <b>health</b> <b>status</b> could be assessed using a common metric (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) which simultaneously accounted for both premature mortality and the prevalence, duration and severity of the non-fatal consequences of disease and injury. As a consequence, mental health conditions and injuries, for which non-fatal outcomes are of particular significance, were identified as being among the leading causes of disease/injury burden worldwide, with clear implications for policy, particularly prevention. A major achievement of the Study was the complete global descriptive epidemiology, including incidence, prevalence and mortality, by age, sex and Region, of over 100 diseases and injuries. National applications, further methodological research and an increase in data availability have led to improved national, regional and global estimates for 2000, but substantial uncertainty around the disease burden caused by major conditions, including, HIV, remains. The rapid implementation of cost-effective data collection systems in developing countries is a key priority if global public policy to promote health is to be more effectively informed...|$|E
40|$|This {{health care}} {{evaluation}} has three purposes: 1) identify {{and measure the}} health status of Alaska Natives in the Chugach Region to {{provide the basis for}} planning health care services; 2) increase the awareness of Chugach Region Natives about their health and the dynamics of the health systems surrounding them; and 3) develop a spirit and vehicle of collaboration among Native consumers and non-Native health care providers in the region. The audience for the study was the participants themselves [...] the individual communities, health care providers, and health planners. A responsive-naturalistic evaluation approach was used to evaluate the health status of the region. A multi-disciplinary team of health care providers, community research assistants, consultants in anthropology, health planning and medical anthropology, and the Health Department of the North Pacific Rim designed and conducted the evaluation project. Objective data about health problems, health care facilities, and manpower were derived from the Indian Health Service Reporting System, a regional inventory, and various public reports. To gather behavioral and attitudinal information about health practices and utilization of available health care services, a community-involvement approach was used. The sample to be surveyed in each community was determined by the local community research assistants after a community meeting was held to introduce the project, its purpose, and the survey process. The principal causes of mortality and morbidity seem to originate largely from the lifestyle of the population and the physical and social environment in which they live. The present medical care system, while still much needed, is not equipped to deal with the types of health problems indicated. The <b>regional</b> <b>health</b> <b>status</b> data related to accidents, mortality, alcoholism and admissions to Alaska Psychiatric Institute indicate that the etiology of illness in the Native population lies in the social, psychological, and behavioral domains rather than the biological domain as traditionally diagnosed and treated by western medicine. Conclusions: Each community contributed specific recommendations for improving health care in their own community. Some shared recommendations were: 1) to clear the confusion concerning funding procedures and coverage; 2) to orient health care providers to behavioral and attitudinal norms of Natives regarding health and illness; 3) and to provide preventive medical education and consumer education about medical and dental services...|$|E

DESIGN: Postal questionnaire survey sent to patients before and six months after surgery. SETTING: The three plastic surgery departments in the Oxford <b>Regional</b> <b>Health</b> Authority, during April to August 1993. SUBJECTS: 166 women (over the age of 16 years) referred for breast reduction; scores from the "short form 36 " (SF- 36) health questionnaire completed by women in the 1991 - 2 Oxford healthy life survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Health</b> <b>status</b> of breast reduction patients before and after surgery as assessed by the SF- 36, the 28 item general health questionnaire, and Rosenberg's self esteem scale; comparisons between the <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of breast reduction patients and that of women in the general population; outcome of surgery as assessed retrospectively by patients. RESULTS: Differences between the <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of breast reduction patients and that of women in the general population were detected by the SF- 36 both before and after surgery. Breast reduction surgery produced substantial change in patients' physical, social, and psychological function. The proportion of cases of possible psychiatric morbidity according to the general health questionnaire fell from 41 % (22 / 54) before surgery to 11 % (6 / 54) six months after treatment. Eighty six per cent (50 / 58) of patients expressed great satisfaction with the surgical result postoperatively.

40|$|Health {{inequality}} is {{a problem}} with great political importance all over the world. Urban-rural inequality in health has attracted great attentions in recent years in China, but very few researches have been undertaken into <b>regional</b> discrepancies in <b>health.</b> This research aims at measuring the degree of <b>regional</b> <b>health</b> inequality in China and identifying its determinants. Indicators for <b>health,</b> socioeconomic <b>status,</b> <b>health</b> resources and health services delivery were selected through Delphi consultations from 18 experts. With cross-sectional data from 31 provinces, composite health indexes were generated. The <b>regional</b> inequality in <b>health</b> was described by Lorenz curve and measured by Gini coefficient. The determinants of health inequality were identified through canonical correlation analysis. The results showed that there existed distinct <b>regional</b> disparities in <b>health</b> in China, which were mainly reflected in "Maternal & Child Health" and "Infectious Diseases", not in the most commonly used health indicator average life expectancy. The <b>regional</b> <b>health</b> inequality in China was increasing with the rapid economic growth. The <b>regional</b> <b>health</b> inequality was associated with not only the distribution of wealth, but also the distribution of health resources and primary health care services. Policy makers {{need to be aware of}} three major challenges when they try to achieve and maintain equality in distribution of health: First, the most commonly used health indicators are not necessarily sensitive enough to detect health inequalities. Second, increase in health inequality is often accompanied with rapid economic growth and increase in life expectancy. Countries in transition are facing the greatest challenge in developing a fair and equitable health care system. Finally, investment in health resources does bring about differences in distribution of health.

This study also examines the relationship between <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> <b>health</b> care resources, and socioeconomic status. A panel data from “All China Data ” and China Health Statistic Yearbooks is used in this study. These data include <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> <b>health</b> care resources, and socioeconomic status variables at the provincial level from 1980 to 2003. Index of disparity {{was used as the}} indicator for measuring <b>regional</b> disparity in <b>health</b> and health care resources.

The results of this study show that the disparities in maternal mortality, number of beds, and number of doctors increased and then declined in most recent years. However, the values of their indexes of disparity in 2002 are still higher than their values in 1985. Therefore the disparities in <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and <b>health</b> care resources across the provinces increased after the economic reform.

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} natural geography on human health in Peru, {{a country that has}} performed rather poorly, in the Latin American context, in terms of reducing its infant and maternal mortality rates. We measured natural geography through rainfall, temperature, altitude, longitude, and latitude. We also analyzed the effect that natural geography may have on the effectiveness of government health investments. We find evidence that geography has an important and independent influence on the infant mortality rate (IMR) and the child malnutrition rate (CMNR). As latitude and longitude increase (i. e., as one moves towards the southwest) the IMR drops. Also, higher levels of rainfall (as in the Jungle region), and higher latitudes increase the CMNR. Lower temperatures, such as those observed in the Mountain region, seem to cause higher rates of child malnutrition. Geography also appears to affect the effectiveness of government health care investments. As latitude increases towards the south, thereby reducing the IMR, health centers and posts see their effectiveness reduced. Likewise, as longitude increases towards the west, thus helping to reduce the IMR, government health centers and posts become less effective in curtailing infant mortality. These results point to a decreasing marginal productivity of government health care spending. Several variables other than geography also affect <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> For example, we find that an increase in the illiteracy rate from 10 percent to 50 percent would bring about an increase in the IMR from 40 to 75 deaths per 1, 000 live births. Female illiteracy has an important influence on the IMR as well, with higher levels of illiteracy being associated with a higher IMR. A policy of increasing general and female education through public spending thus appears to be an effective way of improving infant and child health. The government of Peru has invested heavily in ambulatory facilities in areas of high IMR. These new investments may have had a positive impact on child health. However, whatever this impact, so far it appears to be mild, and not enough to overcome the low <b>health</b> <b>status</b> that led to these new investments in the first place. While endogeneity problems have kept us from measuring the effectiveness of public investments in ambulatory care infrastructure, we find that the number of doctors working in public facilities has a positive influence on child <b>health</b> and nutritional <b>status.</b> We are able to show through simulations how new public resources devoted to new facilities and doctors could be allocated among the provinces to reduce <b>regional</b> inequality in <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Finally, we find that natural geography exacerbates inequality in <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> as do existing regional differences in the availability of public services, such as potable water, sewerage, electricity, and in education.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} outcome indicators to monitor the quality of care. Traditionally, outcome indicators have been based mainly on biological indicators reflecting death or disease. Now that various instruments for <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measurement have become available, questions have been raised as to the potential application of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> scores in monitoring the quality of care. This paper identifies conditions which should be fulfilled before such applications can be recommended. Firstly, the relationship between care delivery processes and <b>health</b> <b>status</b> outcomes must be established. In order to achieve this, <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures which are clearly able to detect <b>health</b> <b>status</b> variations between groups of patients (i. e. discriminative ability) and variations over time (i. e. sensitivity to change) are needed. Secondly, <b>health</b> <b>status</b> data should be available, preferably from established data collection registries (e. g. computerized hospital records or national registries) where data relating to the description of variations in <b>health</b> <b>status</b> (between physicians, hospitals, regions, etc.) are routinely collected. Thirdly, methods should be found to collect additional data, including 'case-mix' information and <b>health</b> <b>status</b> reference data, in order to enable the interpretation of variations in <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Because most of these conditions are currently not being fulfilled, we conclude that the state-of-the-art of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measurement has not yet matured sufficiently to allow for the use of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> as an indicator of quality of care.

There is growing literature about <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures in patients with asthma and chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease (COPD). The European Respiratory Journal (ERJ) has published numerous articles on issues related to <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> The authors believe that the ERJ is a valuable resource in this area, especially for summarizing updated issues on the <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of pulmonary disease [1], or vali-dating new questionnaires or comparing <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures. Clinicians need to understand and critically eva-luate measurements of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> in order to determine if a new therapy could be applied to their own patients with expectation of improving their <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> However, {{it is also true that}} many readers face confusion and difficulty in interpreting the results of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures. Important concepts when evaluating measurements of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> are the {{clinically significant}} threshold or the minimal clinically significant difference (MCSD) [2]. When <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is measured using a continuous scale, it needs to be known whether an observed difference indicates a clinically significant or trivial effect on the patients 9 <b>health</b> <b>status</b> or quality of life. A statistically significant difference in <b>health</b> <b>status</b> might be of little practical importance; it is more important to know the MCSD. There are several defi-nitions of the MCSD that correspond to the per-spective of those who evaluate. For example, JAESCHKE et al. [3] define "minimal clinically important differ-ence " as the smallest difference in a score in a domain of interest that patients perceive as beneficial and that would mandate, in the absence of side-effects and a change in the patient 9 s management [3].

40|$|Objectives: To examine if, {{and to what}} extent, {{disparities in}} <b>health</b> <b>status</b> exist between ethnic Russians and the native {{majority}} populations of four former Soviet Republics; and to determine to what extent indicators of socio-economic status and lifestyle behaviours explain variations in <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Study design: Data from the World Health Organization’s World Health Surveys of former Soviet Republics that include information on ethnicity (i. e. Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Russia) were used. Russia was included as the benchmark population {{as it is the}} country of origin of ethnic Russians. Data were collected from respondents aged 25 years in 2001 e 2003. Methods: Principal component analysis was used to derive the <b>Health</b> <b>Status</b> Index and Household Wealth Index. Multiple classification analysis was applied {{to examine the effects of}} the determinants on <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> including ethnic group membership. Results: In Estonia and Kazakhstan, ethnic Russians have, on average, a lower <b>health</b> <b>status</b> than members of the majority population, while their <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is higher in Ukraine. Higher levels of material wealth, educational attainment and physical activity were associated with a higher <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> The association of these variables with <b>health</b> <b>status</b> was often stronger than the association between ethnic group membership and <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Conclusion: Differences in <b>health</b> <b>status</b> between Russian ethnic minorities and the majority populations were found in Estonia and Kazakhstan, but were non-existent in Latvia and were the opposite of what was expected in Ukraine. Use of the <b>Health</b> <b>Status</b> Index in combination with multiple classification analysis proved to be a useful approach to examine <b>health</b> <b>status</b> differentials, and to identify and profile vulnerable groups in a society. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Our {{main goal}} was to examine {{in a sample of}} female {{patients}} with fibromyalgia the associations among negative affect, positive affect, physical <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> and emotional distress. Moreover, we intended to determine whether emotional distress acts as a mediator between negative affect and physical <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> as well as between positive affect and physical <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Results have shown that a lower physical <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is associated to higher levels of negative affect, emotional distress, and lower levels of positive affect. Furthermore, we have found support for the mediating role of emotional distress between negative affect and physical <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> On the other hand, the relationship between positive affect and physical <b>health</b> <b>status</b> was only partially mediated by emotional distress.

40|$|Background: Health {{is defined}} as the {{presence}} or absence of illness. This conceptualization of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is dominant in health treatment and in fashioning the health care system. However, very little research has been done on how Jamaicans view <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and quality of life (QoL). Aims: This article seeks to understand how Jamaicans conceptualize <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and QoL because definitional content has implications for their health. Material and Methods: The current study utilized two national cross-sectional probability surveys from the Centre for Leadership and Governance (CLG) which looked at QoL among other variables and the Jamaican Survey of Living Conditions (JSLC) which measured living standards including <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> The sample in both surveys was 8, 120 participants. Results: The majority of the respondents in the CLG (54 %) and the JSLC (82. 2 %) surveys reported good <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> There was a strong statistical relationship between area of residence and <b>health</b> <b>status</b> (P < 0. 0001) unlike the relationship between area of residence and quality of life (P < 0. 137). The respondents dichotomized <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and QoL and a significant relationship was found between both variables (P < 0. 0001). The respondents’ dichotomization of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and QoL is explained by the significant relationship between <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and self reported illness (P < 0. 0001) where respondents view <b>health</b> <b>status</b> as the absence or presence of illness, excluding QoL. Conclusion: <b>Health</b> <b>status</b> means {{the presence or absence of}} illness and excludes QoL which is not in keeping with previous findings. This distinction is culturally determined...|$|R

40|$|To date, no {{study has}} {{assessed}} {{the course of}} patient-reported <b>health</b> <b>status</b> in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Studying <b>health</b> <b>status</b> trajectories and their baseline determinants would permit the identification of patients at risk for poor health outcomes after ICD implantation. A combined cohort of 1, 222 patients with an ICD (79 % men; age = 61. 4 [11. 2] years) completed the 12 -Item Short-Form Health Survey at baseline and 2 to 3 months and 12 to 14 months after implantation. Latent class analyses were used to identify trajectories and predictors of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> over time. Most <b>health</b> <b>status</b> trajectories showed a stable pattern after short-term follow-up, with differences between trajectories being mainly related to differences in absolute levels of <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Seven trajectories were identified for physical <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Being unemployed, symptomatic heart failure, ICD shock, psychotropic medication, negative affectivity, and type D personality were identified as independent determinants of poorer physical <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> For mental <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> 6 trajectories were identified. Younger age, low educational level, symptomatic heart failure, renal failure, no use of ACE inhibitors, psychotropic medication, negative affectivity, and type D personality were identified as independent determinants of poorer mental <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> In conclusion, the population with an ICD seems to be heterogeneous in terms of patient-reported physical and mental <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Patients with an ICD who present with poor <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and a distressed personality profile should be timely identified and monitored as they may benefit from cardiac rehabilitation in combination with behavioral intervention...|$|R
