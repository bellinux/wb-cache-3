5|$|As {{the team}} with the best regular season record, the Presidents' Trophy winner is {{guaranteed}} home-ice advantage in all four <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stanley Cup playoffs, provided they advance that far.

The last team to win both the Presidents' Trophy and the Stanley Cup in the same season was the 2012–13 Chicago Blackhawks. The only team to accomplish this more than once is the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E

Liverpool by contrast made hard work of overcoming lower-league opponents Tranmere Rovers and Wycombe Wanderers in the latter <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition. The final {{marked the first time}} that two managers born outside the British Isles had met in an FA Cup final – French compatriots Arsène Wenger and Gérard Houllier.|$|E

However, the divorce of his parents and anxiety derived from the fear of failing at college baseball led Gattis to abuse alcohol and marijuana. He went undrafted in the 2004 draft.|$|E
