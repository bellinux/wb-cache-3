40|$|The {{results of}} {{free-stream}} wind tunnel experiments on semi-balanced skeg rudders are presented. The tests on these rudders are an extension to earlier tests on a parent skeg rudder, {{which were the}} subject of a separate report, and complete a series of tests on three skeg rudders having taper ratios of 0. 59, 0. 80 and 1. 00. The experiments establish {{a better understanding of the}} working and performance of semi-balanced skeg rudders, and provide design data. Results are presented as lift and drag coefficients and centre of pressure for the rudder plus skeg combinations, for the rudders alone and skegs alone; complete ranges of <b>rudder</b> <b>angles</b> of attack were tested for selected positive and negative angles of attack on the skegs. Supplementary tests were carried out to determine the influences of Reynolds No., the size of the gap between rudder and tunnel floor, the transition strip and the effect of sealing the gap between rudder and skeg. In order to provide bases for comparison, the all-movable cases were simulated for each rudder by sealing the gap between rudder and skeg and varying the angles of attack on rudder and skeg simultaneously. The results for the all-movable cases compare very satisfactorily with existing published data. The results for the skeg rudders show that with increasing angle of attack, discontinuities occur in the growth of lift together with a large movement of centre of pressure. Sealing the gap between rudder and skeg was seen to lead to a significant improvement in the lift developed at higher <b>rudder</b> <b>angles</b> of attack. The results for the three skeg rudders are compared, and the flow breakdown accounting for the discontinuities in the skeg rudder characteristics is discussed...|$|R

These studies seek to determine the effectiveness of synthetic jet flow control in increasing side force over the vertical tail. The two models under investigation are the Beta model, with 12 jets aligned along the span of the stabilizer, and a Beta model scaled up {{by a factor of}} 1. 969, with 24 jets aligned along the span of the stabilizer. These two models have Reynolds numbers of 3. 6 * 10 ^ 5 and 7. 1 * 10 ^ 5, respectively, where both are based on the mean aerodynamic chord. The flow solver, Phasta, is used to run these simulations. URANS simulations on the Beta model with a 5 degree sideslip angle and 20 degree <b>rudder</b> deflection <b>angle</b> show that unsteady blowing with a blowing ratio of 1. 0 increases the total side force coefficient by 14 % with respect to the baseline. The Cp data obtained as a function of percent chord showed improvement in Cp from unsteady blowing in the outboard region, but negligible change in the inboard region. This data is in agreement with experimental values. Speed isosurface data was obtained for the Beta model with a 0 degree sideslip angle and 30 degree <b>rudder</b> deflection <b>angle,</b> with steady blowing.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} hydrodynamics {{issues that are}} {{associated}} with AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles) as they approach a cone-shaped dock, which is proposed by most AUV docking systems for the AUVs protection and simplification. However, this docking system is more sensitive to the hydrodynamic interactions between the dock and the ocean currents. The purpose is to exploit the hydrodynamic susceptibility in AUV docking with the dock and to identify a probable design for AUV control during docking. To achieve this purpose, numerical simulations of an AUV docking with a dock are conducted based on the dynamic mesh method. This paper illustrates the numerical methodology for AUV docking simulation. To increase the accuracy of the numerical simulation, turbulence models and grid-dependence problems are first studied. Then, 3 D (three-dimensional) numerical simulations show the dependence of the AUV fluid forces near the dock on various velocities, accelerations, dock shapes, gliding modes, cross currents from several directions and <b>rudder</b> <b>angles.</b> The hydrodynamic behaviors of an AUV docking with a dock are obtained, which provide helpful suggestions for successful docking...|$|R

40|$|A {{modified}} {{lifting line}} theory is developed which supports {{the form of}} skeg-rudder experimental free-stream data obtained previously, and forming the subject of separate reports. It is demonstrated that satisfactory predictions of {{the form of the}} spanwise loadings for different skeg and <b>rudder</b> <b>angles</b> can be made using lifting line theory with the effect of the skeg being incorporated as local incidence reduction and the effects of the mid-span and tip trailing vortices being incorporated as twist corrections to the local incidence. The correct magnitude of the distributions is obtained by applying suitable empirical corrections. Chordwise centre of pressure is derived empirically. It is concluded that whilst the theoretical approach is relatively simple and requires empirical correction, it gives very realistic predictions of skeg-rudder performance characteristics. The theory is used to provide a limited extension to the experimental data. Predictions using the modified theory show that, for fixed aspect ratio and taper ratio, changes in the skeg depth have the largest influence on the production of lift whereas changes in the skeg chord and sweep mainly affect the stock position and the required balance area...|$|R
40|$|Active Flow Control (AFC) {{experiments}} {{performed at}} the Caltech Lucas Adaptive Wall Wind Tunnel on a 12 %-thick, generic vertical tail model indicated that sweeping jets emanating from the trailing edge (TE) of the vertical stabilizer significantly increased the side force coefficient {{for a wide range}} of <b>rudder</b> deflection <b>angles</b> and yaw angles at free-stream velocities approaching takeoff rotation speed.

Even C(sub mu) = 0. 5 % increased the side force in excess of 20 % under these conditions.

50|$|A {{towing tank}} is a basin, several metres wide and {{hundreds}} of metres long, equipped with a towing carriage that runs on two rails on either side. The towing carriage can either tow the model or follow the self-propelled model, and is equipped with computers and devices to register or control, respectively, variables such as speed, propeller thrust and torque, <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> etc. The towing tank serves for resistance and propulsion tests with towed and self-propelled ship models {{to determine how much}} power the engine will have to provide to achieve the speed laid down in the contract between shipyard and ship owner. The towing tank also serves to determine the maneuvering behaviour in model scale. For this, the self-propelled model is exposed to a series of zig-zag maneuvers at different <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> amplitudes. Post-processing of the test data by means of system identification results in a numerical model to simulate any other maneuver like Dieudonné spiral test or turning circles. Additionally, a towing tank can be equipped with a PMM (planar motion mechanism) or a CPMC (computerized planar motion carriage) to measure the hydrodynamic forces and moments on ships or submerged objects under the influence of oblique inflow and enforced motions. The towing tank can also be equipped with a wave generator to carry out seakeeping tests, either by simulating natural (irregular) waves or by exposing the model to a wave packet that yields a set of statistics known as response amplitude operators (acronym RAO), that determine the ship's likely real-life sea-going behavior when operating in seas with varying wave amplitudes and frequencies (these parameters being known as sea states). Modern seakeeping test facilities can determine these RAO statistics, with the aid of appropriate computer hardware and software, in a single test.|$|E

She then fired two more; both hit. Her victim was apparently sinking when the submarine left the scene of the attack, but postwar analysis of Japanese records did not confirm the kill. On 11 February, while investigating a surface contact. Tarpon was illuminated by the enemy's searchlight.

On the night of 23 February - 24 February, Tarpon ran aground while attempting to navigate Boling Strait, west of Flores Island. Jettisoning ammunition, fresh water, fuel, and torpedoes failed to lighten the ship enough to float her off. A native boat then took an officer ashore on the island of Adunara, later returning with the only white man on the island, a Dutch missionary, Pastor H. von Den Rulst. He informed Wallace the next high tide would occur between 16:00 and 18:00. His warning that Japanese planes had been over the island during each of the past four days caused the crew a bit of uneasiness until flood tide. Then, with three engines backing, she slid off the bottom, returning to Fremantle on 5 March.|$|E
40|$|The {{use of an}} {{unsteady}} computational fluid {{dynamic analysis}} of the manoeuvring performance of a self-propelled ship requires a large computational resource that restricts its use {{as part of a}} ship design process. A method is presented that significantly reduces computational cost by coupling a blade element momentum theory (BEMT) propeller model with the solution of the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations. The approach allows the determination of manoeuvring coefficients for a self-propelled ship travelling straight ahead, at a drift angle and for differing <b>rudder</b> <b>angles.</b> The swept volume of the propeller is divided into discrete annuli for which the axial and tangential momentum changes of the fluid passing through the propeller are balanced with the blade element performance of each propeller section. Such an approach allows the interaction effects between hull, propeller and rudder to be captured. Results are presented for the fully appended model scale self-propelled KRISO very large crude carrier 2 (KVLCC 2) hull form undergoing static rudder and static drift tests at a Reynolds number of 4. 6 × 106 acting at the ship self-propulsion point. All computations were carried out on a typical workstation using a hybrid finite volume mesh size of 2. 1 × 10 ^ 6 elements. The computational uncertainty is typically 2 – 3 % for side force and yaw moment. <br/...|$|R

The objective of the work {{was to assess the}} ease with which such a code could be used as part of the design process using computational resources already available to the yacht designer. The flexible geometry creation process allowed the complete hull, keel-bulb and rudder configuration to be defined both for upright and heeled configurations and tested for a range of hull drift and <b>rudder</b> <b>angles.</b> The surface panel solution was obtained using an iterative process whereby each underwater component was solved independently and then {{in the presence of the}} velocity field induced by all the other components.

50|$|The Mountwood and her {{identical}} sister Woodchurch {{originally had}} bright orange funnels {{with a black}} base and black soot buffer. On the main deck, there was a forward, heated shelter and also a main saloon, aft of this was the toilets and machine space. Below was a saloon bar. On the top deck was a large open promenade and a forward shelter beneath the bridge, although this shelter was open beneath the bridge so it was often breezy and cold. They had a main central wheelhouse and two side cabs, and power came from two medium speed Crossley 8-cylinder diesel engines. Upon the bridge deck, in the wheelhouse, one would find the large brass helm, the hydraulic steering telemotor. a binnacle, and two conjoined Chadburn Synchrostep engine order telegraphs. These were linked {{to the other two}} identical telegraphs in the docking cabs so they moved in tandem. There was also whistle controls and lighting controls. In the docking cabs or navigation boxes was another binnacle, a whistle control, telegraphs and also various indicators for engine/speed etc. Originally all ferries had a simple ship to shore communicating radio, but did not have radar or sonar. The wheelhouses of the two ferries differed slightly due to different positioning of <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> indicators and engine RPM gauges in the bridge wings. The telegraphs were designed to give the captain direct control of the engines (although they could still be used in the traditional signal / response manner) and as such were marked with commands such as brakeand start.

It is not understood what these were. Some people have said that they were in fact ventilation devices. Upon the bridge there were numerous modern devices. Chadburn synchrostep telegraphs and <b>rudder</b> <b>angle</b> indicators, hydraulic steering telemotor and an automatic whistle control could be found in both the wheelhouse and the navigation boxes. There was also an internal communication system, a ship to shore radio and PA system and three binnacles on the bridge. Similar types of navigation equipment and deck fittings used on these vessels are extant on the Edmund Gardner Pilot Boat at Merseyside Maritime Museum. The Leasowe and Egremont were popular ferries with their crews as they had much improved crew accommodation compared to the earlier steamers, where much of the lower deck space was taken up with boilers and machinery. When the ferries entered service they all had Wallasey white and black funnel liveries. There was, however, a major design fault with Leasowe and Egremont. In order to reach the bows of the ship when casting off etc., crew members were required to either push through the hordes of commuters and climb down a ladder from the forward promenade deck or walk along the rubbing strake and climb over. In flat calm conditions this was not a problem, but in a force 8 gale with the vessel bobbing around wildly, it could be considerably dangerous. The simple reason for such problems was because there was no door leading from the main saloon to the bow area of the ships! ...|$|E
