5|$|The Commission {{is divided}} into {{departments}} known as Directorates-General (DGs) that can be likened to departments or ministries. Each covers a specific policy area such as Agriculture or Justice and citizens' rights or internal services such as Human Resources and Translation and is headed by Director-General who is responsible to a Commissioner. A Commissioner's portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs, they prepare proposals for them and if approved {{by a majority of}} Commissioners it goes forward to Parliament and Council for consideration.

5|$|French women's {{rights advocates}} invited {{international}} feminists {{to participate in}} a parallel conference to the Paris Conference in hopes that they could gain permission to participate in the official conference. The Inter-Allied Women's Conference asked to be allowed to submit suggestions to the peace negotiations and commissions and were granted the right to sit on commissions dealing specifically with women and children. Though they asked for enfranchisement and full legal protection under the law equal with men, those rights were ignored. Women won the right to serve in all capacities, including as staff or delegates in the League of Nations organization. They also won a declaration that member nations should prevent trafficking of women and children and should equally support humane conditions for children, women and men labourers. At the Zürich Peace Conference held between 17-19 May, 1919, the women of the WILPF condemned the terms of the Treaty of Versailles for both is punitive measures, as well as its failure to provide for condemnation of violence and exclusion of women from civil and political participation. Upon reading the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Procedure</b> for the League of Nations, Catherine Marshall, an English suffragist, discovered that the guidelines were completely undemocratic and they were modified based on her suggestion.|$|E
5|$|The Government is {{responsible}} to the Croatian Parliament; the parliament may recall the Government as a whole or {{any member of the}} Government in particular by an absolute majority vote (majority of all MPs) following a request for a confidence vote by one fifth of the parliament members or by the prime minister. The prime minister {{and other members of the}} Government are jointly responsible for decisions passed by the Government and individually responsible for their respective portfolios (areas of responsibility). The President of the Republic appoints the prime minister, who must then secure a vote of confidence from the Croatian Parliament (majority of all MPs); the appointment is therefore counter-signed by the speaker of the parliament to signify this. Appointments of members of the Government are done by the prime minister with the approval of the Croatian Parliament (again signified via a counter-signature by the speaker of the parliament). The <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> and regulations enacted by the Government must be published in Narodne Novine—the official gazette of Croatia—to be binding.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate among}} monks unfolds in the {{presence}} of their teachers, with a very well set <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery’s precincts. The defender has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of the debate is with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.|$|E

In 1938, the Federal <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Civil <b>Procedure</b> were adopted to govern civil procedure in United States federal courts.

25|$|Garner {{has contributed}} to the field <b>of</b> {{procedural}} <b>rules.</b> From 1992 to 1994, he revised all amendments to the sets of Federal Rules—Civil, Appellate, Evidence, Bankruptcy, and Criminal—for the United States Judicial Conference. In the mid-1990s, he restyled the Federal <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Appellate <b>Procedure</b> and the Federal <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Criminal <b>Procedure,</b> which were adopted by the Judicial Conference, then by the United States Supreme Court, and enacted by Congress. The Federal <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Civil <b>Procedure</b> were restyled in 1993–1994 and adopted on December 1, 2007. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts has printed and distributed Garner's booklet Guidelines for Drafting and Editing Court Rules (1st ed. 1996, 5th ed. 2007). Garner has revised the Texas <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Appellate <b>Procedure,</b> the California <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Appellate <b>Procedure,</b> the California Judicial Council Rules, the Local <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, and the Rules on Judicial-Conduct and Disability Proceedings (for federal courts).

25|$|The Organization's {{official}} {{languages are}} Spanish, English, Portuguese, and French. The Charter, the basic instrument governing OAS, makes {{no reference to}} the use of official languages. These references {{are to be found in}} the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Procedure</b> governing the various OAS bodies. Article 51 of the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Procedure</b> of the General Assembly, the supreme body of the OAS, which meets once a year, states that English, French, Portuguese and Spanish are the four official languages. Article 28 stipulates that a Style Committee shall be set up with representatives of the four official languages to review the General Assembly resolutions and declarations. Article 53 states that proposals shall be presented in the four official languages. The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Procedure</b> and Statutes of other bodies, such as the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CIDI), the Permanent Executive Committee of the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CEPCIDI), the Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM), the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD), the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and the Inter-American Juridical Committee (CJI), technical bodies of the OAS, also mention the four official languages in which their meetings are to be conducted. Policy is therefore dictated through these instruments that require use of the four official languages at meetings.|$|E
