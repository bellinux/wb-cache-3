40|$|The rib-skin {{construction}} using {{carbon fiber}} composites {{has been an}} attractive design option for aircraft control surfaces like aileron, elevator, <b>rudder,</b> <b>flap</b> etc. The major concern in such structures is the debonding between skin and rib flange which can occur due to low velocity impacts like tool drops, run way debris etc. Such debonds which occur in service are barely visible and may not get detected till the next inspection schedule. The integrity of the structure in the intervening period is of great concern to the designers. In the present work, the structural integrity of a composite flap structure having multiple debonds at the rib skin interfaces under fatigue loading has been addressed. The flap is subjected to cyclic loading at design limit load for 110000 cycles using a whiffle tree mechanism. The strains have been monitored at different locations to understand the behaviour of structure during the test using strain gauges and Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. Ultrasonic A-scan was used to monitor the defect growth after each block of 1000 cycles. The growth of debonds was not significant during the fatigue testing. The strain levels did not change appreciably throughout the test period indicating the damage tolerance capacity of the flap structure. The low growth of debonds was attributed to {{the low level of}} strains in the structure since the flap design is driven by stiffness considerations...|$|E

40|$|Current {{aircraft}} {{models from}} different manufacturers have already structural components made of CFRP (fuselage and wing shell, <b>rudder,</b> <b>flaps),</b> {{which must be}} reinforced by special profiles. In {{the state of the}} art processes, these profiles are pre-bonded with conduction- and convection-based heating methods, which are time consuming and inefficient. At the Center for Lightweight Production Technology (ZLP) of the German Aerospace Centre in Stade a new method for pre-bonding was patented and the foundation for industrialization was laid by extensive research. By using inductive heating, the process time for the pre-bonding of stringers is reduced from 30 - 45 seconds to 3 - 5 seconds per adhesive point. In cooperation with Premium Aerotec GmbH the applicability to Airbus A 350 fuselage panel manufacturing was investigated. A comparison to ultrasonic heating and {{the state of the art}} pre-bonding method as well as the development and testing of automation concepts were performed. While the technique reached the next phase on the way to series production several findings emerged, which may require further process adaptions. To control the temperature on the bottom side repeatable and independent from stringer type or side attempts to regulate the process were made. Based on optical temperature measurements on the stringer’s top surface, the induction generator power was adjusted using different algorithms. Then several experiments were performed to establish a relation between top and bottom side temperatures in fast processes. Thermographic analysis showed that hotspots occurred during the heating process of A 350 stringers, which worsened the temperature homogeneity and shrunk the process window. The problem was considered to be related to the junctions between different plies and could be solved by using an alternative induction coil design. Additionally, this new coil design is supposed to increase overall temperature homogeneity and decrease material dependencies significantly. It makes the process much more controllable. This paper summarizes the methods used to confront inductive heating with ultrasonic and the state of the art technology. Furthermore the automation concepts and thoughts on quality assurance are presented. Finally it shares the insights and results of the performed experiments as well as the future focus of research...|$|R

40|$|Re-entry {{vehicles}} generally require {{control surfaces}} (e. g., <b>rudders,</b> body <b>flaps)</b> to steer them during flight. Control surface seals are installed along hinge lines and where control surface edges move {{close to the}} vehicle body. These seals must operate at high temperatures and limit heat transfer to underlying structures {{to prevent them from}} overheating and causing possible loss of vehicle structural integrity. This paper presents results for thermal analyses and mechanical testing conducted on the baseline rudder/fin seal design for the X- 38 re-entry vehicle. Exposure of the seals in a compressed state at the predicted peak seal temperature of 1900 F resulted in loss of seal resiliency. The vertical Inconel rudder/fin rub surface was re-designed to account for this loss of resiliency. Room temperature compression tests revealed that seal unit loads and contact pressures were below limits set to protect Shuttle thermal tiles on the horizontal sealing surface. The seals survived an ambient temperature 1000 cycle scrub test over sanded Shuttle tiles and were able to disengage and re-engage the tile edges during testing. Arc jet tests confirmed the need for seals in the rudder/fin gap location because a single seal caused a large temperature drop (delta T = 1710 F) in the gap...|$|R

50|$|Various {{elements}} of the Caravelle were designed to maximise passenger comfort and operator convenience. One such measure was the rear entry door with built-in stairs which, while adding structural complexity, meant that mobile airport stairs were unnecessary. On later variants, soundproofing {{in the form of}} readily-removable mattress-like rolls which fixed in place via existing brackets was added to the design. In some configurations, the Caravelle's cabin was furnished with a number of rearward-facing passenger seats, which was an uncommon arrangement amongst civil aircraft. From September 1963 onwards, an autolanding capability via two separate systems, one of which being self-contained while the other was integrated with the airliner's autopilot, was made available for the Caravelle by Sud Aviation. The primary assembly line for the Caravelle was based at Sud Aviation's factory at Blagnac Airport, Toulouse, however much of the aircraft was manufactured at other sites across France and in other countries. The production of large portions of the Caravelle had been subcontracted to other manufacturers; these included the Italian aircraft manufacturer Fiat Aviazione, who produced the aircraft's tailplane, fin, ailerons, and engine nacelles, French aviation firm Breguet Aviation, who performed the outfitting of the rear fuselage, while much of the ancillary equipment of the Caravelle originated from either British or American manufacturers.
