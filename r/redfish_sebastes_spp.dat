We estimate that most of the escapement in the combined selection system (consisting of a 55 -mm grid and a diamond mesh codend) happens through the grid. We demonstrated that for one of the two grid systems investigated the increase in size selection obtained experimentally by increasing grid-bar spacing is well in line with what could be expected based on the morphology of redfish. However, the size selection observed experimentally was significantly lower than the size-selective potential of the grids estimated based on the morphology of redfish. By computer simulations, we show that a possible explanation for this difference could be that not all redfish that attempt to escape through the grid make their attempt with an optimal angle of attack...|$|E

40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} EU project on redfish, otolith shape {{analysis}} and otolith trace element assays were conducted to test for differences between distribution areas. Otolith morphometry and shape (Fourier) descriptors were compared between sampling areas of golden <b>redfish</b> (<b>Sebastes</b> marinus) and deep-sea <b>redfish</b> (<b>Sebastes</b> mentella) in the North Atlantic. A first series of trace element assays was performed using laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) on cross-sections of S. mentella otoliths. Geographical separation by these methods appeared to be weak, although some distinction of western, central and eastern areas was apparent for otolith shapes of S. marinus. Trace element concentrations in S. mentella otoliths differed between three otolith zones (core, 3 -year annulus and edge), giving first hints to physiological effects and/or migration. Differences in elemental concentrations between areas showed repeated patterns for some elements, indicating area-specific signatures. Multivariate analysis of these signatures, however, revealed no clear discrimination of distribution areas. Since the otolith shape analysis was limited to material from medium-sized fish (30 - 40 cm total length) and microchemical assays were only performed on a sub-set of S. mentella otoliths, further investigations will be carried out during the next months to reveal more information on possible natural markers for redfish...|$|R
40|$|Two {{species of}} redfish of {{commercial}} interest occur off West Greenland inshore and offshore, golden <b>redfish</b> (<b>Sebastes</b> marinus L.) and deep-sea <b>redfish</b> (<b>Sebastes</b> mentella Travin). SSB and recruitment indices for golden redfish decreased drastically from 1982 and have remained significantly below the average level since 1989. Taking {{into account the}} recent very low SSB and the recruitment failure together with the absence of golden redfish in the Greenland surveys, the stock of golden redfish in Subarea 1 {{is considered to be}} severely depleted with no signs of recovery. The deep-sea redfish SSB has been extremely low since 1989. The deep-sea redfish show high variation in recruitment. Good recruitment has been seen in 1997, 2000 and 2001, while the recruitment in 2002 again was very poor. Substantial numbers of redfish are discarded in the shrimp fishery, and concern must be expressed about the continuing failure of the juveniles to rebuild the pre-mature and mature stock components. From Oct. 1 2000, sorting grids have been mandatory in the shrimp fishery and this will hopefully reduce the amount of juvenile redfish in the by-catch significantly.

The next most important prey was deep-sea shrimp (Pandalus borealis), the consumption of which dropped from about 0. 6 million tonnes in 1984 to below 0. 3 million tonnes in 1986. Measured in numbers consumed, there was also a considerable consumption of young <b>redfish</b> (<b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp.)</b> and herring (Clupea harengus), and in the last years also of young cod and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus).

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} comparing acoustic and bottom-trawl surveys was conducted on Atlantic <b>redfish</b> (<b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{on the edge of}} the Green and Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Canada. Redfish were on or near bottom by day and migrated vertically in the water column at night. In an attempt to account for biases attributable to the presence of fish in the near-bottom dead zone (DZ), a correction factor was applied based on density values measured within the first few metres above the detected bottom. Acoustic densities within increasing range increments above the bottom were compared with densities estimated from the trawl catch. Swept area was calculated using both the trawl's wing spread and door spread as proxies for the minimum and maximum fishing widths. Uncorrected acoustic densities were significantly higher during the night than during the day. No significant day/night differences for the entire water column were observed after DZ corrections. Close agreement between acoustic and trawl densities was obtained by integrating within the first 10 to 20 m off the bottom, with or without the DZ corrections, for both day and night experiments, but regression slopes differed. Trawl catchability appeared to be density-dependent at night, being higher at lower fish densities. Daytime acoustic estimates were more variable than those made at night, as indicated by consecutive passes of several transects and CVs of density (means of 131 % during day, 35 % at night). We conclude that acoustic measurements made at night provide the most reliable and least variable density estimates, and make recommendations for surveys...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Mass-balance models using inverse {{methodology}} {{have been}} constructed for the northern Gulf of St. Law-rence ecosystem in the mid- 1980 s, before the groundfish collapse. The results highlight {{the effects of the}} major mortal-ity sources (fishing, predation, and other sources of mortality) on the fish and invertebrate communities. Main predators of fish were large cod (Gadus morhua) followed by <b>redfish</b> (<b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp.),</b> capelin (Mallotus villosus), and fisheries. Large cod were the most important predator of small cod, with cannibalism accounting for at least 44 % of the mortal-ity of small cod. The main predators of large cod were harp (Phoca groenlandica) and grey (Halichoerus grypus) seals. However, predation represented only 2 % of total mortality on large cod. Mortality other than predation domi-nated the mortality processes at 52 % of the total, while the fishery represented 46 %. Tests were performed to identify possible sources of this unexplained mortality. The only way to significantly reduce unexplained mortality on large cod in the model was to increase landings of large cod above those reported. This suggests that fishing mortality was sub-stantially underestimated in the mid- 1980 s, just before the demise of a cod stock that historically was the second larg-est in the northwest Atlantic.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{formation}} of abundance of <b>redfish</b> (<b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp)</b> and cod (Gadus morhua) year-classes under varying conditions of spawning, of which a key role is played by water circula-tion. A statistically significant relationship (r= 0. 601, p= 0. 002) between survival of cod year-classes and atmospheric cyclonic activity was revealed. This relationship {{is based on the}} effect of storms on water circulation over the Flemish Cap and supports the hypothesis on the impact of year-to-year variation in the Taylor column circulation on the cod survival. By contrast with cod, the survival of larval redfish is to a large extent related to the position of the North Atlantic Current, which impacts on the main spawning grounds (southern slopes of the bank) and correspondingly may influence the drift of larvae away from the bank. This is supported by a reciprocal relationship (r=- 0. 565, p= 0. 012) between redfish survival rate on the Flemish Cap and position of the northern front of the Gulf Stream by latitude south of the Grand Banks near 51 °W. The emergence of very strong year-classes of redfish in Div. 3 M is likely to be related more to the hydrographic conditions rather than to the status of the spawning stock. It is most probable that a stronger anticyclonic eddy leds to increased year-class strength, while weak eddies result in a more powerful drift of larval and juvenile redfish away from the bank. In turn, the emergence of strong year-classes may, in a way, be an “indicator ” of specific types of water circulation on the bank...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} habitat {{used during}} spawning may potentially {{be an important}} factor affecting reproductive output of broadcast spawning marine fishes, particularly for species with complex, substrate-oriented mating systems and behaviors, such as Atlantic cod Gadus morhua. We characterized the habitat use and behavior of spawning Atlantic cod at two locations off the coast of southwestern Iceland during a 2 -d research cruise (15 – 16 April 2009). We simultaneously operated two different active hydroacoustic gear types, a split beam echosounder and a dual frequency imaging sonar (DIDSON), as well as a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). A total of five fish species were identified through ROV surveys: including cusk Brosme brosme, Atlantic cod, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, lemon sole Microstomus kitt, and Atlantic <b>redfish</b> <b>Sebastes</b> <b>spp.</b> Of the three habitats identified in the acoustic surveys, the transitional habitat between boulder/lava field and sand habitats was characterized by greater fish density and acoustic target strength compared to that of sand or boulder/lava field habitats independently.

Individuals were observed ascending 1 – 5 m into the water column from the bottom at an average vertical swimming speed of 0. 20 – 0. 25 m s− 1 and maintained an average spacing of 1. 0 – 1. 4 m between individuals.

ED differed among species and was influenced by body size, season, geography, and year of collecting. Herring, capelin and Gonatus squid had the highest ED; Atlantic cod, American plaice, sand lance, Arctic cod and northern shrimp had the lowest. ED increased greatly with size (age) in capelin, and also in Greenland halibut and Illex squid. Other species showed no strong relationships of ED to body size. ED was greater in male than female northern shrimp. ED in capelin was highest in winter. Arctic cod had higher ED offshore than nearshore in eastern Newfoundland.

The stomach contents of three species were studied: 320 of American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), 203 of <b>redfish</b> (<b>Sebastes</b> Marinus) and 468 of cod (Gadus morhua). The cod specimens were classified taking into account age groups; {{in the case of}} other species by length classes. The food items, the prey occurrence index and the diversity index were determined too. The Schoener overlap index was calculated to study the intraspecific diet overlap in cod and the interspecific diet overlap between the three species. The relation between predator size (cod) and prey size (redfish) was also studied...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (Paz and Larrafieta, 1989) we obtained {{a significant positive}} correlation between cod year-class size in Div. 3 NO and American plaice spawning biomass in Div. 3 LNO, that was interpreted by supposing a strong predation of 0 -group cod on 0 -group American plaice. On the contrary, we have not found significant correlations between cod year-classes and spawning biomasses of other species in the area as redfish, yellowtail and mackerel. Following the same method, {{in this paper we}} explore correlations between American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) and yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) year-class sizes and biomasses of adult fishes of these species and those of cod (Cactus morhua), mackerel (Scomber seombrus) and <b>redfishes</b> (<b>Sebastes</b> app. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Redfish</b> (<b>Sebastes</b> marinus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} fish species in Icelandic fishing grounds and has been highly exploited. In recent years the number of redfish caught has decreased as a consequence of decreasing stock size. A Marine Protected Area (MPA) was established in 1994 to protect juvenile redfish. This project focuses on this area west of Iceland. The data collected in this report is from 1985 - 2002. After the MPA was established, the mean length of redfish has increased by about 1 - 2 cm. From the three first years to the three last years of the period the number of species in the MPA has increased by three. Biodiversity has increased after the MPA wa...|$|R
