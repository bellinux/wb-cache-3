5|$|<b>Rumination</b> {{syndrome}} {{in adults}} {{is a complicated}} disorder whose symptoms can mimic those of several other gastroesophogeal disorders and diseases. Bulimia nervosa and gastroparesis are especially prevalent among the misdiagnoses of <b>rumination.</b>|$|E
5|$|The chewing of cud by {{animals such as}} cows, goats, and giraffes is {{considered}} normal behavior. These animals are known as ruminants. Such behavior, though termed <b>rumination,</b> {{is not related to}} human <b>rumination</b> syndrome, but is ordinary. Involuntary <b>rumination,</b> similar to what is seen in humans, has been described in gorillas and other primates. True merycism, as opposed to the cud-chewing process in ruminants, is also a normal part of the digestive process in some other animals, such as kangaroos.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>rumination</b> syndrome within {{the general population}} has not been defined. <b>Rumination</b> is sometimes described as rare, but has also been described as not rare, but rather rarely recognized.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{exploration}} of the relationship between retrospectively perceived desired parental involvement and current troubled <b>ruminations</b> about fathers and mothers by young adults. It investigates the impact of family form on desired parental involvement and troubled <b>ruminations.</b> The data were taken from a larger project (Finley, Mira, 2 ̆ 6 Schwartz, 2008), consisting of 1, 714 ethnically diverse, young adult university students. The results show a significant correlation between desired paternal involvement and troubled <b>ruminations</b> about fathers (r=. 369,...|$|R

5|$|Gastroparesis {{is another}} common misdiagnosis. Like <b>rumination</b> syndrome, {{patients}} with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a meal. Unlike <b>rumination,</b> gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, {{which is not}} being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E

5|$|<b>Rumination</b> {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} which affects {{the functioning of the}} stomach and esophagus, also known as a functional gastroduodenal disorder. In patients that have a history of eating disorders, <b>Rumination</b> {{syndrome is}} grouped alongside eating disorders such as bulimia and pica, which are themselves grouped under non-psychotic mental disorder. In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability, <b>Rumination</b> syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of eating disorders.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rumination</b> {{syndrome}} {{presents itself}} {{in a variety of}} ways, with especially high contrast existing between the presentation of the typical adult sufferer without a mental disability and the presentation of an infant and/or mentally impaired sufferer. Like related gastrointestinal disorders, <b>rumination</b> can adversely affect normal functioning and the social lives of individuals. It has been linked with depression.|$|E

5|$|The term <b>rumination</b> {{is derived}} from the Latin word ruminare, which means to chew the cud. First {{described}} in ancient times, and mentioned in the writings of Aristotle, <b>rumination</b> syndrome was clinically documented in 1618 by Italian anatomist Fabricus ab Aquapendende, who wrote of the symptoms in a patient of his.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of <b>rumination</b> {{syndrome}} is non-invasive {{and based on}} {{a history of the}} individual. Treatment is promising, with upwards of 85% of individuals responding positively to treatment, including infants and the mentally handicapped.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} of normal intelligence, <b>rumination</b> {{is not an}} intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing to counter the urge to regurgitate. Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal <b>rumination</b> period. A similar breathing pattern {{can be used to}} prevent normal vomiting. Breathing in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents.|$|E

5|$|Little {{comprehensive}} {{data regarding}} <b>rumination</b> syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness {{and are often}} misdiagnosed due {{to the number of}} symptoms and the clinical similarities between <b>rumination</b> syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus, such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa. These symptoms include the acid-induced erosion of the esophagus and enamel, halitosis, malnutrition, severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of bulimia.|$|E
5|$|Studies of <b>rumination</b> in {{otherwise}} healthy adults became decreasingly rare {{starting in the}} 1900s, {{and the majority of}} published reports analyzing the syndrome in mentally healthy patients appeared thereafter. At first, adult <b>rumination</b> was described and treated as a benign condition. It is now described as otherwise. While the base of patients to examine has gradually increased as more and more people come forward with their symptoms, awareness of the condition by the medical community and the general public is still limited.|$|E

5|$|Abdominal pain(38.1%), lack of fecal {{production}} or constipation(21.1%), nausea(17.0%), diarrhea(8.2%), bloating(4.1%), and dental decay(3.4%) are also described as common symptoms in day-to-day life. These symptoms {{are not necessarily}} prevalent during regurgitation episodes, and can happen at any time. Weight loss is often observed (42.2%) at an average loss of 9.6kilograms, and {{is more common in}} cases where the disorder has gone undiagnosed {{for a longer period of}} time, though this may be expected of the nutrition deficiencies that often accompany the disorder as a consequence of its symptoms. Depression has also been linked with <b>rumination</b> syndrome, though its effects on <b>rumination</b> syndrome are unknown.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rumination</b> {{syndrome}} is a poorly understood disorder, {{and a number}} of theories have speculated the mechanisms that cause the regurgitation, which is a unique symptom to this disorder. While no theory has gained a consensus, some are more notable and widely published than others.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rumination</b> {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing <b>rumination</b> syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30minutes of {{the completion of a}} meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.|$|E
