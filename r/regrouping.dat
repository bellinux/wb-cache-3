5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily <b>regrouping,</b> Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but began to fall back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men {{arrived on the scene}} to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force and all of his artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was <b>regrouping,</b> {{amassing}} new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings {{showed that the}} Taliban had returned. In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.|$|E
5|$|On 24 December 1962, UN {{troops and}} Katangese gendarmes clashed near Élisabethville and {{fighting}} broke out. After attempts {{to reach a}} ceasefire failed, UN troops launched Operation Grandslam and occupied Élisabethville, prompting Tshombe to leave the country. A ceasefire was agreed soon thereafter. Indian UN troops, exceeding their orders, then occupied Jadotville, preventing Katangese loyalists from <b>regrouping.</b> Gradually, the UN overran {{the rest of the}} Katanga and, on 21 January 1963, Tshombe surrendered his final stronghold of Kolwezi, effectively ending the Katangese secession.|$|E

40|$|We present <b>ReGroup,</b> a novel {{end-user}} interactive {{machine learning}} system for helping people create custom, on-demand groups in online social networks. As a person adds members to a group, <b>ReGroup</b> iteratively learns a probabilistic model of group membership specific to that group. <b>ReGroup</b> then uses its currently learned model to suggest additional members and group characteristics for filtering. Our evaluation shows that <b>ReGroup</b> is effective for helping people create large and varied groups, whereas traditional methods (searching by name or selecting from an alphabetical list) are {{better suited for}} small groups whose members can be easily recalled by name. By facilitating on-demand group creation, <b>ReGroup</b> can enable in-context sharing and potentially encourage better online privacy practices. In addition, applying interactive machine learning to social network group creation introduces several challenges for designing effective end-user interaction with machine learning. We identify these challenges and discuss how we address them in <b>ReGroup.</b> Author Keywords Interactive machine learning, social network group creation, access control lists, example and feature-based interaction...|$|R

5|$|Following this defeat, Troglita fled to Iunci (modern Bordj Younga, 9km {{south of}} Mahares), where he began <b>regrouping</b> the survivors. The losses were so {{high and the}} army's morale so low, however, that he was soon forced to {{withdraw}} further north to the fortress of Laribus (the modern village of Lorbeus, near Le Kef), where he started mustering his army. Learning of the battle, Antalas immediately rose up again and joined the Tripolitanian tribes, while the Byzantines' allies, Cutzinas and Isfidaias, were quarreling among themselves. Throughout the remainder of 547, the Moors were free to raid across Africa, even reaching the vicinity of Carthage itself.|$|E

After <b>regrouping</b> at Mas a Fuera, Spee had decided to raid British shipping routes in the South Atlantic. On 21 November, the East Asia Squadron put into St. Quentin Bay to coal; the crews piled up coal on the ships' decks to allow them to steam {{all the way to the}} Port of Santa Elena, where Spee had arranged for colliers out of Montevideo to meet them on 5 December.|$|E

5|$|The Admiralty ordered Captain Warburton-Lee {{to attack}} German {{shipping}} in Narvik, Norway on 9 April. The following morning Hardy led four of her half-sisters down Ofotfjord in a surprise dawn attack on Narvik harbour during a blinding snowstorm. A torpedo from Hardy blew off {{the stern of}} the German flagship, , and killed the German flotilla commander, Commodore Friedrich Bonte. Heidkamp sank the next day. Another hit a merchant ship in the stern. A second salvo of four torpedoes was fired at two other German destroyers, but missed and badly damaged the ore docks. After <b>regrouping,</b> Captain Warburton-Lee led another attack on the harbour later that morning, but inflicted little additional damage due to poor visibility.|$|E
5|$|The ROK 3rd Division {{followed}} the withdrawing NK 5th Division, and the ROK Capital Division advanced against the retreating {{survivors of the}} NK 12th Division. On September 15 some elements of the Capital Division reached {{the southern edge of}} An'gang-ni. Reports indicated that North Korean troops were retreating toward Kigye. With the threat in the east subsiding, Eighth Army dissolved Task Force Church, effective at 12:00 September 15, and the ROK Army resumed control of the ROK I Corps. Eighth Army also ordered the US 24th Infantry Division to move to Kyongsan, southeast of Taegu, in a <b>regrouping</b> of forces. The US 21st Infantry Regiment had already moved there on the 14th. The US 9th Infantry was to remain temporarily at Kyongju in Eighth Army reserve.|$|E

Though a few jeeps and trucks were found and commandeered, most of the retreat was carried out on foot. A few scattered artillery shells landed around the retreating force, but North Korean soldiers did not aggressively pursue them. By noon the disorganized remains of the 34th Infantry had outrun all enemy fire and were out of immediate danger.|$|E

5|$|The line 8...Qa3 puts {{pressure}} on the white queenside pawns, pressure that may later be intensified with Nf6–e4.

5|$|The two armies clashed at Kalavrye on the Halmyros {{river in}} what is now European Turkey. Alexios Komnenos, whose army was {{considerably}} smaller and far less experienced, tried to ambush Bryennios's army. The ambush failed, and the wings of his own army were driven back by the rebels. Alexios barely managed to break through with his personal retinue, but succeeded in <b>regrouping</b> his scattered men. At the same time, and despite having seemingly won the battle, Bryennios's army fell into disorder after its own Pecheneg allies attacked its camp. Reinforced by Turkish mercenaries, Alexios lured the troops of Bryennios into another ambush through a feigned retreat. The rebel army broke and Bryennios was captured.|$|E
5|$|After <b>regrouping,</b> Carter, Susan and Preacher go to a {{decompression}} {{chamber and}} swim to the surface. Carter {{realizes that the}} sharks made them flood the facility so they could escape through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort to distract the last shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan cuts herself and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract the shark, she is unable {{to get out of}} the water. Carter dives in, but is too late to save her from being devoured. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a harpoon, but the spear also goes through Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing the shark. In the end, Carter managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a workers' boat en-route on the horizon.|$|E

50|$|For {{more than}} two moduli, the method for two moduli allows the {{replacement}} of any two congruences by a single congruence modulo {{the product of the}} moduli. Iterating this process provides eventually the solution with a complexity, which is quadratic in the number of digits of the product of all moduli. This quadratic time complexity does not depend on the order in which the moduli are <b>regrouped.</b> One may <b>regroup</b> the two first moduli, then <b>regroup</b> the resulting modulus with the next one, and so on. This strategy is the easiest to implement, but it also requires more computation involving large numbers.|$|R
5|$|After {{three months}} of {{inactivity}} and <b>regrouping,</b> Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to begin fighting again. The target chosen for the first attack was {{the northern city of}} Ruhengeri, which lies immediately south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the best choice from a practical point of view, being the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region was as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence, and Kagame hoped the attack would destabilise the government.|$|E
5|$|Caxias {{was growing}} old, and was ill and {{exhausted}} {{by the time he}} reached Asunción. As he did not feel up to the task of pursuing López into the Paraguayan hinterland, he asked to be either relieved of his post or given a short leave. Although his request was denied, he appointed a senior member of his staff as acting commander, and left for Brazil on 19 January 1869. The Emperor was angered that the marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already won—even though López was still at large and <b>regrouping</b> his few remaining military assets. Caxias' ill-conceived decision seriously endangered the hard-won achievements of the past months, even as the objective of eliminating López as a threat remained tantalizingly within reach.|$|E

Thomas Neville {{accompanied}} {{them when they}} marched out of London on 2 December 1460 to restore a semblance of order to the region; they arrived at York's Sandal Castle on 21 of the month. It is possible that a Christmas Truce was arranged; in any case, nine days later, York, his son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, Salisbury, Thomas, {{and many of their}} closest retainers led a sortie in strength to attack a Lancastrian army gathered near the castle. Here, at the Battle of Wakefield, they went down to a crushing defeat, and Thomas died in combat, his father was subsequently executed, and their heads were displayed above the gates of York.|$|E

After <b>regrouping</b> on 5–8 January 1945, it attacked again, crossing the Wiltz River on 20 January. The division continued its advance, taking Grumelscheid on 21 January, and crossed the Clerf River on 24 January. The division was reassigned to XX Corps. The division immediately shifted to the east bank of the Saar, and maintained defensive positions in the Saarlautern area from 29 January until 6 March 1945.|$|E

Originating from a tropical storm east of the Leeward Islands on August20, the storm tracked west-northwest, entering the Caribbean Sea as a minimal hurricane the next day. After striking Hispaniola on August23, the hurricane made another landfall in eastern Cuba before reentering the Caribbean. Once back over open water, the storm intensified into a Category3 hurricane and moved across the northern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula. By August26, the storm had emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a weakened, but <b>regrouping</b> system. It attained its peak winds of 120mph (185km/h) that evening. Maintaining this intensity, the system made landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas late on August27 and rapidly dissipated the following afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The 44th Infantry Division {{landed in}} France via Omaha Beach on September 15, 1944.

The division was hit by a heavy counterattack by forces of Nazi Germany on October 25–26. The attack was repulsed and the 44th remained in the sector for several weeks. On November 13, 1944, it attacked northeast, advancing through the Vosges Mountains east of Leintrey to Dossenheim, and capturing Avricourt, on November 17.
