5|$|A {{tropical}} storm warning was raised for Bermuda as Colin approached but was later discontinued as it weakened. Average winds of 31mph (50km/h) were observed across the island, although peak winds fell {{just shy of}} {{tropical storm}} intensity at 37mph (60km/h). L.F. Wade International Airport received 0.16in (4.06mm) of rainfall. Although Colin steered well clear of the Carolinas, swells from the storm prompted at least 205 water rescues, and a <b>rip</b> <b>current</b> off Ocracoke led to the drowning of one man.|$|E
5000|$|In popular usage, {{the word}} [...] "{{undertow}}" [...] is often misapplied to <b>rip</b> <b>currents.</b> An undertow occurs everywhere underneath shore-approaching waves, whereas <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> are localized narrow offshore currents occurring at certain locations along the coast.

5|$|Early in its duration, Hurricane Florence {{produced}} large swells {{that affected}} the East Coast of the United States. Rip currents caused three deaths due to drowning in North Carolina, {{all in the}} southern portion of the state. Seven other people needed rescue, {{and at least two}} beaches were closed. Florence contributed to a locally high number of rip current-related deaths in 2000; in response, the National Weather Service office in Wilmington implemented a new <b>rip</b> <b>current</b> warning system for the summer of 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} produced waves up to 3ft (0.9m) around Anna Maria Island, {{where two}} people died of fatigue-related heart attacks after {{being caught in}} a <b>rip</b> <b>current.</b> Heavy rainfall in the New Orleans, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama areas—aided by instability from {{the remnants of the}} depression—flooded streets, inundating an apartment complex in the former city and cutting power to 1,921 customers in the latter city. Forty homes and businesses were flooded in Avoyelles Parish. Rainfall accumulations peaked south of Natchez, Mississippi, where 13.9in (353mm) was documented.|$|E
5|$|Across Florida, Gordon's winds damaged {{power lines}} and knocked down trees and traffic signals; about 425,000people lost power due to the storm. The rains caused {{flooding}} in Dade and Collier counties, which damaged $275million worth of crops, mostly to vegetables and sugar cane. In some locations, the crop damage was worse than during Hurricane Andrew in 1992, due to fewer crops being planted when Andrew struck the state. Along Elliott Key, Gordon damaged the coral reef system {{to a greater extent}} than Andrew. Inland flooding damaged buildings due to fast-rising water and roof collapses. In Volusia County, floods entered 1,236buildings, causing $26million in damage. Flooding caused dozens of roads to close, some of which were washed out. In the Everglades, flooding killed several deer. Statewide, two people drowned in separate instances after driving into flooded areas. Three people drowned along beaches, including one man who died in a <b>rip</b> <b>current</b> while attempting to rescue his son. In Hillsboro Inlet, two people drowned after their boat was overturned by high waves. Throughout Florida, Gordon directly killed eight people, and injured 43people. There were also three indirect deaths; two were from traffic accidents, and one was related to a heart attack after a person pushed a stalled car in a flooded road. Statewide damage was estimated at $400million (1994 USD, $ USD).|$|E
40|$|Oceanic Rossby {{waves and}} eddies flux energy and fluid westward, the latter through the Stokes drift or bolus transport. While the wave energy is largely {{dissipated}} {{at the western}} boundary, mass conservation requires that the fluid be returned offshore through Rossby <b>rip</b> <b>currents.</b> The form and magnitude of these <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> are investigated through linear Rossby wave theory, a nonlinear numerical model, and analysis of sea surface height satellite observations. The net eastward volume transport by Rossby <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> over the global ocean {{is estimated to be}} of order 10 Sv (1 Sv ≡ 106 m 3 s - 1). In an eddying ocean, both the westward Stokes drift and eastward <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> can assume the form of banded quasi-zonal jets.

50|$|<b>Rip</b> <b>currents</b> are a {{potential}} source of danger for people in shallow water with breaking waves in seas, oceans and lakes. <b>Rip</b> <b>currents</b> are the proximate cause of 80% of rescues carried out by beach lifeguards.|$|R
40|$|Rip currents-strong, isolated, offshore-directed flows-can {{occur in}} the absence of {{bathymetric}} features such as rip channels. No consensus exists regarding the cause of these impressive but life-threatening features, sometimes called “flash” <b>rip</b> <b>currents.</b> In a new model, flash <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> self-organize because of feedbacks resulting from a newly hypothesized interaction between waves and currents. Robust predictions arise from this numerical model: Flash <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> become less prevalent with increasing beach slope and increasing variations in incident-wave heights. The results of field tests of these predictions support this model, but are not consistent with some other models, as applied to the flash <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> on beaches such as those in Southern California...|$|R
5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A <b>rip</b> <b>current</b> can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E
25|$|Oceanographers {{have two}} {{theories}} on <b>rip</b> <b>current</b> formation. The wave interaction model assumes that two edges of waves interact, create differing wave heights, and cause longshore transport of nearshore currents. The Boundary Interaction Model {{assumes that the}} topography of the sea bottom causes nearshore circulation and longshore transport; the result of both models is a <b>rip</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rip {{currents}} are water {{channels that}} flow {{away from the}} shore. Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a <b>rip</b> <b>current</b> {{appears to be an}} area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or fifty feet. However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a <b>rip</b> <b>current.</b> Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a <b>rip</b> <b>current</b> because it is a fast and effortless way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.|$|E
25|$|Distant effects {{included}} high {{waves and}} <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> throughout the Gulf of Mexico. One person {{was killed and}} at least nine others had to be rescued from Panama City Beach, Florida, {{as a result of}} <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> caused by Dolly.|$|R
50|$|The {{state of}} Florida was {{affected}} by both the Cuba landfall, with Gustav traveling past the Florida Keys, and the Louisiana landfall (September 1), affecting the Florida panhandle, with storm surge and outer band tornadoes and thunderstorms. Several tornado warnings were issued around the Pensacola area. Panhandle beaches had <b>rip</b> <b>currents,</b> and officials in Pensacola Beach had been passing out pamphlets warning of deadly <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> that could continue for days. Four people died in <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> on Florida beaches.|$|R
50|$|The {{interaction}} between the extratropical remnant and a high pressure system produced strong <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> along the coastline of Long Island.

25|$|The {{vorticity}} and inertia of rip currents {{have been}} studied. From {{a model of}} the vorticity of a <b>rip</b> <b>current</b> done at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, it was found that a fast <b>rip</b> <b>current</b> extends away from shallow water, the vorticity of the current increases, and the width of the current decreases. This model also acknowledges that friction plays a role and waves are irregular in nature. From data from Sector-Scanning Doppler Sonar at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, it was found that rip currents in La Jolla, CA lasted several minutes, reoccurred one to four times per hour, and created a wedge with a 45° arch and a radius 200–400 meters.|$|E
25|$|According to the Red Cross, a {{total of}} 843 homes were {{affected}} by the storm throughout Texas; 68 were destroyed, 231 sustained major damage and 283 received minor damage.

Surprisingly, there are many types of <b>rip</b> <b>currents</b> that can occur on beaches, and these currents are created by a wide variety of mechanisms that are presented here, along with numerical, physical, or field validation. We also show the potential for prediction schemes for use by lifeguards and beach managers...|$|R
