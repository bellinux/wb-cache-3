40|$|Abstract <b>Reference</b> <b>services</b> {{have always}} been {{essential}} in academic libraries by meeting undergraduates’ information needs for enhanced academic achievement. It provides personalised information services to users in ensuring that their needs are adequately satisfied. However, in recent times, users’ satisfaction with <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> has become of great concern, as poor satisfaction of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> will negatively affect subsequent use. There is dearth of scholarly research on patronage of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> by undergraduates in Nigeria. The study, therefore, investigated the influence of users’ needs and satisfaction on the patronage of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> by undergraduates in selected universities in Osun State, Nigeria. The survey research design was adopted for the study while questionnaire tagged “User Needs, Satisfaction, and Patronage of <b>Reference</b> <b>Services</b> (UNSPRS) ” was used for data collection. Random sampling technique was used to select 400 out of 29, 013 undergraduates in the selected universities in Osun State. Frequency counts, mean and standard deviation, correlation and multiple regression were used to analyse the data with hypotheses tested at 0. 05 level of significance. The results showed that inadequate time for <b>reference</b> <b>services,</b> lack of current <b>reference</b> materials, poor <b>service</b> quality and unfriendly reference personnel affect the patronage of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> by the undergraduates. <b>Reference</b> <b>services</b> were moderately patronised by the undergraduates. The mean analysis revealed that undergraduates of the selected universities showed a moderate need for <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> and are only moderately satisfied with the <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> available to them. There was positive significant relationship between user needs and patronage of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> (r= 0. 455, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). There was also {{a significant relationship between}} user satisfaction and patronage of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> (r= 0. 422, P 3 ̆e 0. 05). The study recommended that the university libraries in Osun State should provide user-oriented <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> that will meet the users’ needs and increase patronage by undergraduates.

Based in the Progressive era's philosophy of science as a problem-solver, and modeled after successful research branches of state legislatures, the LRS would provide informed answers to Congressional research inquiries on almost any topic. [...] In 1965, Congress passed an act allowing the Library of Congress to establish a trust fund board to accept donations and endowments, giving the Library a role as a patron of the arts. The Library received the donations and endowments of prominent individuals such as John D. Rockefeller, James B. Wilbur and Archer M. Huntington. Gertrude Clarke Whittall donated five Stradivarius violins to the Library and Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge's donations paid for a concert hall within the Library of Congress building {{and the establishment of}} an honorarium for the Music Division.

40|$|Purpose: This study aims {{to develop}} a {{framework}} for evaluating <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> in public libraries, and to propose a practical technique for measuring the quality of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> based on the framework. Methods: Some previous studies on evaluating <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> are reviewed to construct a new framework for the evaluation. The resulting framework consists of four dimensions: constructional components of evaluation, context of evaluation, criteria of evaluation, and methods and measures of evaluation. Based on {{a review of the}} literature, this paper suggests that the quality of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> should be evaluated through questionnaire surveys of library users because this method has proven to be e#ective. The author attempts {{to develop a}} questionnaire that can e#ectively assess the quality of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> from the viewpoint of library users, by carefully examining the results of focus group interviews of actual users of public libraries. Results: A new framework for evaluating <b>reference</b> <b>services,</b> which has hitherto never been considered, is constructed through a literature review and critical analysis in this paper. Also, a template of questionnaires for evaluating the quality of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> is developed as a...|$|R
2500|$|Evans' {{successor}} L. Quincy Mumford {{took over}} in 1953. Mumford's tenure, lasting until 1974, saw the initiation {{of the construction of}} the James Madison Memorial Building, the third Library of Congress building. Mumford directed the Library during a period of increased educational spending, the windfall of which allowed the Library to devote energies towards establishing new acquisition centers abroad, including in Cairo and New Delhi. In 1967, the Library began experimenting with book preservation techniques through a Preservation Office, which grew to become the largest library research and conservation effort in the United States. [...] Mumford's administration also saw the last major public debate about the Library of Congress' role as both a legislative library and a national library. A 1962 memorandum by Douglas Bryant of the Harvard University Library, compiled at the request of Joint Library Committee chairman Claiborne Pell, proposed a number of institutional reforms, including expansion of national activities and services and various organizational changes, all of which would shift the Library more towards its national role over its legislative role. Bryant even suggested possibly changing the name of the Library of Congress, which was rebuked by Mumford as [...] "unspeakable violence to tradition". [...] Debate continued within the library community until the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 shifted the Library back towards its legislative roles, placing greater focus on research for Congress and congressional committees and renaming the Legislative <b>Reference</b> <b>Service</b> to the Congressional Research Service.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} informal use of two children???s digital <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> {{that were used}} for purposes unintended by the designers. The motivation for this research was to explore the ways that children bend to their own informal uses the formal tools designed to support their education. Research questions included, How and with what frequency do children use digital <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> to answer their own questions? Do digital <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> support self-initiated learning? Could digital <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> support the transfer of student motivation and curiosity from formal education to informal education? What do instructional and software designers need to consider in creating tools that support a notion of transformed education and learning? Results answered these questions and uncovered several unanticipated fi ndings. Digital <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> were shown to support efforts to interest children in science-related careers as early as fourth or fi fth grade and to support self-initiated learning in science. Unanticipated fi ndings showed that students ask different kinds of questions as they progress through school, and they should receive training {{in the use of}} digital <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> in elementary school. Further conclusions provide insights for digital <b>reference</b> software and <b>service</b> design and suggestions for more strategic pedagogical use of digital <b>references</b> <b>services.</b> (from the article) published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

40|$|It is {{reasonable}} to assume the existence of a new "dynamic" that influences how to measure <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> in libraries and how we evaluate the reference librarians who provide those services. Traditional, face-to-face delivery of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> is reported to be declining, and there is myriad evidence, albeit largely uncollated and little evaluated, that suggests reference librarians are delivering significant and increasing amounts of the services they render in network environments. These trends raise questions, in turn, about how well we understand the current state of affairs in <b>reference</b> <b>services,</b> particularly where the management and evaluation of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> in network environments are concerned. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate relevant circumstances and conditions bearing [...] directly and indirectly [...] on changes in the nature, form, substance, and effects of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> [...] through the reference librarian experience.
