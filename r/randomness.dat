5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified {{on the sides of the}} body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the <b>randomness</b> of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E
5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its <b>randomness,</b> and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanics}} of crafting and gathering have changed between the original release and A Realm Reborn. Most {{of these changes}} are geared toward reducing the <b>randomness</b> and guesswork involved in these processes. For Disciples of the Hand, all recipes of the appropriate level are unlocked by default in the Crafting Log. Crafting abilities have been rebalanced to allow successful high-quality synthesis without requiring multiple mastered Disciplines of the Hand. For Disciples of the Land, players are allowed to select which item {{they would like to}} attempt to collect at a gathering point, whereas before, the results of gathering attempts were randomized. The Gathering Log also displays the names and locations of items that can be gathered in the world.|$|E
5|$|Writing for PC Gamer, Leif Johnson complimented {{the variety}} of {{multiplayer}} game modes available. This sentiment was shared by other reviewers who thought the multiplayer offering was considerably more diverse than what was typically available in most RTS games. Numerous critics regarded Blitz to be the standout multiplayer mode, however they were still apprehensive about its shortcomings. GamesRadar reviewer Robert Zak called Blitz the most forward-thinking area of Halo Wars 2, in contrast {{to other parts of}} the game which he thought were formulaic. Other writers agreed that the mode was an interesting twist on RTS and enjoyed playing it. While Blitz card packs could be earned through playing the game, both Bratt and Rignall still expressed disappointment about the inclusion of microtransactions for purchasing card packs. Johnson and Stapleton suspected that winning games in Blitz may be too reliant on the luck of the draw. Consequently, Stapleton thought the mode was unsuitable for competitive multiplayer but felt that the <b>randomness</b> and card mechanics worked well in the Firefight variant.|$|E
25|$|Claude Shannon's {{development}} of Information theory in 1948 {{gave rise to}} the entropy view of <b>randomness.</b> In this view, <b>randomness</b> is the opposite of determinism in a stochastic process. Hence if a stochastic system has entropy zero it has no <b>randomness</b> and any increase in entropy increases <b>randomness.</b> Shannon's formulation defaults to Boltzmann's 19th century formulation of entropy in case all probabilities are equal. Entropy is now widely used in diverse fields of science from thermodynamics to quantum chemistry.|$|E
25|$|That is, an {{infinite}} sequence is random if and only it withstands all recursively enumerable null sets. The other notions of random sequences include (but not limited to): recursive <b>randomness</b> and Schnorr <b>randomness</b> {{which are based}} on recursively computable martingales. It was shown by Yongge Wang that these <b>randomness</b> notions are generally different.|$|E
25|$|From any Bernoulli process one may derive a Bernoulli {{process with}} pnbsp&=nbsp&1/2 by the von Neumann extractor, the {{earliest}} <b>randomness</b> extractor, which actually extracts uniform <b>randomness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Around 300 BC Epicurus {{proposed}} {{the concept that}} <b>randomness</b> exists by itself, independent of human knowledge. He believed that in the atomic world, atoms would swerve at random along their paths, bringing about <b>randomness</b> at higher levels.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese of 3000 {{years ago}} were perhaps the {{earliest}} people to formalize odds and chance. The Greek philosophers discussed <b>randomness</b> at length, but only in non-quantitative forms. It {{was only in the}} 16th century that Italian mathematicians began to formalize the odds associated with various games of chance. The invention of the calculus had a positive impact on the formal study of <b>randomness.</b> In the 1888 edition of his book The Logic of Chance John Venn wrote a chapter on The conception of <b>randomness</b> that included his view of the <b>randomness</b> of the digits of the number pi by using them to construct a random walk in two dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Over the centuries, many Christian {{scholars}} {{wrestled with}} {{the conflict between the}} belief in free will and its implied <b>randomness,</b> and the idea that God knows everything that happens. Saints Augustine and Aquinas tried to reach an accommodation between foreknowledge and free will, but Martin Luther argued against <b>randomness</b> and took the position that God's omniscience renders human actions unavoidable and determined. In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas viewed <b>randomness</b> not {{as the result of a}} single cause, but of several causes coming together by chance. While he believed in the existence of <b>randomness,</b> he rejected it as an explanation of the end-directedness of nature, for he saw too many patterns in nature to have been obtained by chance.|$|E
25|$|Several {{authors also}} claim that {{evolution}} and sometimes development require a specific form of <b>randomness,</b> namely the apparition of qualitatively new behaviors. Instead of {{the choice of}} one possibility among several pre-given ones, this <b>randomness</b> corresponds {{to the formation of}} new possibilities.|$|E
25|$|In ancient history, the {{concepts}} of chance and <b>randomness</b> were intertwined with that of fate. Many ancient peoples threw dice to determine fate, and this later evolved into games of chance. Most ancient cultures used various methods of divination to attempt to circumvent <b>randomness</b> and fate.|$|E
25|$|The {{early part}} of the 20th century saw a rapid growth in the formal {{analysis}} of <b>randomness,</b> as various approaches to the mathematical foundations of probability were introduced.

25|$|Although <b>randomness</b> {{had often}} {{been viewed as}} an {{obstacle}} and a nuisance for many centuries, in the 20th century computer scientists {{began to realize that}} the deliberate introduction of <b>randomness</b> into computations can be an effective tool for designing better algorithms.

25|$|Random strings {{were first}} studied {{by in the}} 1960s by A. N. Kolmogorov (who had {{provided}} the first axiomatic definition of probability theory in 1933), Chaitin and Martin-Löf. The algorithmic <b>randomness</b> of a string {{was defined as the}} minimum size of a program (e.g. in bits) executed on a universal computer that yields the string. Chaitin's Omega number later related <b>randomness</b> and the halting probability for programs.|$|E
25|$|The {{early part}} of the twentieth century saw a rapid growth in the formal {{analysis}} of <b>randomness,</b> and mathematical foundations for probability were introduced, leading to its axiomatization in 1933.

25|$|<b>Randomness</b> {{can be seen}} as {{conflicting}} {{with the}} deterministic ideas of some religions, such as those where the universe is created by an omniscient deity who is aware of all past and future events. If the universe is regarded to have a purpose, then <b>randomness</b> {{can be seen as}} impossible. This is one of the rationales for religious opposition to evolution, which states that non-random selection is applied to the results of random genetic variation.|$|E
25|$|The {{field of}} Kolmogorov {{complexity}} and algorithmic <b>randomness</b> was {{developed during the}} 1960s and 1970s by Chaitin, Kolmogorov, Levin, Martin-Löf and Solomonoff (the names are given here in alphabetical order; {{much of the research}} was independent, and the unity of the concept of <b>randomness</b> was not understood at the time). The main idea is to consider a universal Turing machine U and to measure the complexity of a number (or string) x as the length of the shortest input p such that U(p) outputs x. This approach revolutionized earlier ways to determine when an infinite sequence (equivalently, characteristic function of a subset of the natural numbers) is random or not by invoking a notion of <b>randomness</b> for finite objects. Kolmogorov complexity became not only a subject of independent study but is also applied to other subjects as a tool for obtaining proofs.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} German-style board games, Wallenstein tends to favor player skill and {{foresight}} in planning over <b>randomness</b> when deciding the winner for each game.|$|E
25|$|Rényi entropy – a {{generalization}} of Shannon entropy; {{it is one}} of a family of functionals for quantifying the diversity, uncertainty or <b>randomness</b> of a system.|$|E
25|$|Entropy can be {{normalized}} {{by dividing}} it by information length. This ratio is called metric entropy {{and is a}} measure of the <b>randomness</b> of the information.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{of the concept of}} chance throughout history has been very gradual. Historians have wondered why progress in the field of <b>randomness</b> was so slow, given that humans have encountered chance since antiquity. Deborah Bennett suggests that ordinary people face an inherent difficulty in understanding <b>randomness,</b> although the concept is often taken as being obvious and self-evident. She cites studies by Kahneman and Tversky; these concluded that statistical principles are not learned from everyday experience because people do not attend to the detail necessary to gain such knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{research}} in recursion theory includes {{the study of}} applications such as algorithmic <b>randomness,</b> computable model theory, and reverse mathematics, {{as well as new}} results in pure recursion theory.|$|E
25|$|A digital {{computer}} simulation model of an analog system {{such as the}} brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion. However, the biological neurons also suffer from <b>randomness</b> and limited precision, for example due to background noise. The errors of the discrete model can be made smaller than the <b>randomness</b> of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate, and sufficiently accurate models of non-linearities. The computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations, preferably in real time.|$|E
25|$|The Greek {{philosophers}} {{were the}} earliest Western thinkers to address chance and <b>randomness.</b> Around 400 BC, Democritus presented {{a view of}} the world as governed by the unambiguous laws of order and considered <b>randomness</b> as a subjective concept that only originated from the inability of humans {{to understand the nature of}} events. He used the example of two men who would send their servants to bring water at the same time to cause them to meet. The servants, unaware of the plan, would view the meeting as random.|$|E
25|$|Penrose {{determined}} {{wave function}} collapse {{was the only}} possible physical basis for a non-computable process. Dissatisfied with its <b>randomness,</b> Penrose proposed {{a new form of}} wave function collapse that occurred in isolation and called it objective reduction. He suggested each quantum superposition has its own piece of spacetime curvature and that when these become separated by more than one Planck length they become unstable and collapse. Penrose suggested that objective reduction represented neither <b>randomness</b> nor algorithmic processing but instead a non-computable influence in spacetime geometry from which mathematical understanding and, by later extension, consciousness derived.|$|E
25|$|These {{sequences}} of period p-1 have an autocorrelation function {{that has a}} negative peak of -1 for shift of (p-1)/2. The <b>randomness</b> of these sequences has been examined by diehard tests.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is to incorporate stochastic (random) behaviour into the system. Stochastic behaviour destroys {{information contained in}} the ensemble. While this is technically inaccurate (aside from hypothetical situations involving black holes, a system cannot in itself cause loss of information), the <b>randomness</b> is added to reflect that information of interest becomes converted over time into subtle correlations within the system, or to correlations between the system and environment. These correlations appear as chaotic or pseudorandom influences on the variables of interest. By replacing these correlations with <b>randomness</b> proper, the calculations can be made much easier.|$|E
25|$|Class 2: Nearly all initial {{patterns}} evolve {{quickly into}} stable or oscillating structures. Some of the <b>randomness</b> {{in the initial}} pattern may filter out, but some remains. Local changes to the initial pattern tend to remain local.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} symmetry for <b>randomness</b> {{with positive}} outcomes {{is that the}} former applies for the logarithm, i.e., the outcome and its reciprocal have the same distribution. However this symmetry does not single out any particular distribution uniquely.|$|E
25|$|The many {{applications}} of <b>randomness</b> {{have led to}} many different methods for generating random data. These methods may vary as to how unpredictable or statistically random they are, and how quickly they can generate random numbers.|$|E
