If she can hold off the LNP challenge during a global financial crisis while presiding over a chronic deficit in state-wide infrastructure, Anna Bligh would become the first woman elected to office as a state premier.

40|$|Presented on November 7, 2012 from 6 : 00 pm- 7 : 30 pm in the Reinsch-Pierce Family Auditorium on the Georgia Tech campus. Brian Stone {{teaches in}} the areas of urban {{environmental}} planning, integrated land use and transportation planning, and planning history and theory. Stone's program of research is focused on the spatial drivers of urban environmental phenomena, with an emphasis on air quality and climate change, and is supported through funding from the National Institutes of Health, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among other funding institutions. He is Director of the Urban Climate Lab at Georgia Tech. Prior to joining the Georgia Tech faculty, he taught in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Stone's work on urbanization and climate change recently has been featured on CNN, National Public Radio, and in print media outlets such as Forbes and USA Today. Stone holds degrees in environmental management and planning from Duke University and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Runtime: 76 : 30 minutesAssociate Professor of City and <b>Regional</b> Planning, <b>Brian</b> Stone discusses his new book, The City and the Coming Climate: Climate Change in the Places We Live. This book is the first to explore the dramatic amplification of global warming underway in cities and the range of actions that individuals and governments can undertake to slow the pace of warming. A core thesis of the book is that the principal strategy currently advocated to mitigate climate change [...] the reduction of greenhouse gases [...] will not prove sufficient to measurably slow the rapid pace of warming in urban environments. Brian Stone explains the science of climate change in terms accessible to the nonscientist and with compelling anecdotes drawn from history and current events. The book is an ideal introduction to climate change and cities for students, policy makers, and anyone who wishes to gain insight into an issue critical to the future of our cities and {{the people who live in}} them...|$|R
