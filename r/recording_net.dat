30|$|Migration {{outflows}} {{started to}} increase in 2007, and since 2010, outflows have amounted to more than 400 thousand per year (slightly below 1  % of the total domestic population), which is, both in absolute and relative terms, {{the highest level of}} emigration in Spanish history (Table  1). This is mostly due to the high mobility of foreign nationals. Indeed, they make up the great majority of migration outflows: in 2012, approximately 5  % of foreigners residing in Spain left the country, while less than 1 per thousand of Spaniards born in Spain emigrated. For the latter, migration outflows are still smaller than those registered in the 1960 s, 6 although between 2011 and 2014, outflows have not been offset by inflows, so Spain is now <b>recording</b> <b>net</b> migration outflows of nationals {{for the first time since}} the 1970 s (net outflows in 2012 are estimated at around 70 thousand).|$|E
40|$|This {{laboratory}} study describes the flow and deposition observed {{in and around}} a finite patch of vegetation located at {{the wall of a}} channel. Two patch densities are considered with 2 % and 10 % solid volume fraction. The velocity field, measured in and around the patch by acoustic Doppler velocimetry, revealed three distinct zones. First, there is a diverging flow region at {{the leading edge of the}} patch, where the flow in line with the patch decelerates, and the bulk of the flow is diverted toward the open channel. Second, there is a fully developed region within the vegetation, where the velocity is uniform across the patch width and along the length of the patch. Third, a shear layer forms at the interface between the patch and adjacent open channel. The pattern of deposition in and around the vegetation was characterized by releasing 12 -micron spherical, glass particles and <b>recording</b> <b>net</b> deposition on a set of glass slides. In the diverging region, net deposition increases in the stream-wise direction, as the local velocity decreases. In the fully developed region of the patch, deposition decreases with longitudinal position, as the concentration in the water column is depleted. The deposition pattern is nearly uniform across the patch width, consistent with the velocity field and suggesting that turbulent diffusive flux across the lateral edge of the patch is not a significant source of particles to the patch under the conditions studied here.

40|$|The International Federation of Accountants {{recommends}} a transition of all accounting {{units in the}} public sector to the accrual basis and issues International Public Sector Accounting Standards to support the new concept. Accounting in the Czech public administration is based rather on the cash base with all its drawbacks and complications Regional administration units are finding out and <b>recording</b> <b>net</b> cash flow directly in the system of synthetic accounts of the core activitity in the ledger, with the priority of recording income and expenses. Organizational parts of the state use the same system of bookkeeping based on the same directive charts of accounts. I percieve a conceptual inconsistence in {{the fact that in the}} system of synthetic accounts, the budget surplus or deficit as the main expression of the accounting cash concept is not being found out neither recorded. An obstacle for implementing the accrual principle lies also in the persistent definition of yields. For the area of budget economy of accounting units of public administration, existence of yields is not admitted. The reason is to be found in business concept of yields expecting yields only in rela- tion to the market. This concept will have to be substituted by a concept which respects so called non-exchangeable yields. Then, based on this concept, yield accounts will be incorporated into the charts of accounts of the core activity of the accounting units. Accrual accounting concept, which is also based on the comparison of costs with performance for which they are expended, creates prerequisites also for depreciation of long-term assets. In the current concept of accounting core activity of public administration these long-term assets are not depreciated. Its appreciation and reporting then intentionally does not respect the requirement of true picture of reality. Therefore the content and methodology of changes have to be considered, especially in the following fields: • Acknowledgement and introduction of the category of income as defined by IPSAS; • Restructuring of the pilot accounting system according to the accrual concept; • Detecting budget inflows or outflows outside the system of the synthetic accounts based on the analytical accounts (budget classification); • Restructuring of the accounting statement scheme, namely its internal structure; • Creating legislative conditions to change the system...|$|E
