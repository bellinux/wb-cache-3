5|$|Three {{possible}} {{mechanisms of}} relapse were proposed by Marchoux in 1926 (i) parthenogenesis of macrogametocytes: (ii) persistence of schizonts in small {{numbers in the}} blood where immunity inhibits multiplication, but later disappears and/or (iii) reactivation of an encysted body in the blood. James in 1931 proposed that sporozoites are carried to internal organs, where they enter reticuloendothelial cells and undergo a cycle of development, based on quinine's lack of activity on them. Huff and Bloom in 1935 demonstrated stages of avian malaria that transpire outside blood cells (exoerythrocytic). In 1945 Fairley et al. reported that inoculation of blood from a patient with P. vivax may fail to induce malaria, although the donor may subsequently exhibit the condition. Sporozoites disappeared from the blood stream within one hour and reappeared eight days later. This suggested the presence of forms that persist in tissues. Using mosquitoes rather than blood, in 1946 Shute described a similar phenomenon and proposed {{the existence of an}} 'x-body' or <b>resting</b> <b>form.</b> The following year Sapero proposed a link between relapse and a tissue stage not yet discovered. Garnham in 1947 described exoerythrocytic schizogony in Hepatocystis (Plasmodium) kochi. In the following year Shortt and Garnham described the liver stages of P. cynomolgi in monkeys. In the same year a human volunteer consented to receive a massive dose of infected sporozoites of P. vivax and undergo a liver biopsy three months later, thus allowing Shortt et al. to demonstrate the tissue stage. The tissue form of Plasmodium ovale was described in 1954 and that of P. malariae in 1960 in experimentally infected chimpanzees.|$|E

500|$|A cyst of {{the genus}} Azotobacter is the <b>resting</b> <b>form</b> of a {{vegetative}} cell; however, whereas usual vegetative cells are reproductive, the cyst of Azotobacter does not serve this purpose and is necessary for surviving adverse environmental factors. Following the resumption of optimal environmental conditions, which include a certain value of pH, temperature, and source of carbon, the cysts germinate, and the newly formed vegetative cells multiply by a simple division. During the germination, the cysts sustain damage and release a large vegetative cell. Microscopically, the first manifestation of spore germination is the gradual decrease in light refractive by cysts, which is detected with phase contrast microscopy. Germination of cysts, a slow process, takes about 4–6 h. During germination, the central body grows and captures the granules of volutin, which were located in the intima (the innermost layer). Then the exine bursts and the vegetative cell is freed from the exine, which has a characteristic horseshoe shape. This process is accompanied by metabolic changes. Immediately after being supplied with a carbon source, the cysts begin to absorb oxygen and emit carbon dioxide; the rate of this process gradually increases and saturates after four hours. The synthesis of proteins and RNA, [...] occurs in parallel, but it intensifies only after five hours after {{the addition of the}} carbon source. The synthesis of DNA and nitrogen fixation are initiated 5 h after the addition of glucose to a nitrogen-free nutrient medium.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike other nematodes, Ditylenchus {{destructor}} {{does not}} have a <b>resting</b> <b>form,</b> so environmental conditions have a large impact on the habits of the organism. The most optimal conditions for the nematodes are soils that are around 28 °C. Temperatures above or below this range will inhibit the movement and life cycle of the nematode; therefore, the 28 °C range provides optimal growth conditions. [...] Moist soils are also especially favorable {{for the development of the}} nematode as well as its movement through the soil. Given these conditions, the most opportune locations for Ditylenchus destructor are in midwestern and southern North America as well as central parts of Europe and Asia. In these areas, agricultural practices also largely influence the spread of the pathogen. When harvesting and transporting tubers, moving them in large piles allows the nematodes to move from an infected tuber to surrounding healthy ones, encouraging the spread of disease.|$|E

5000|$|Ranganāthar (Sanskrit : रङ्गनाथ) {{also known}} as Sri Ranganatha, Aranganathar, Ranga and Thenarangathan is a Hindu deity, more well known in South India, and the chief deity of the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam. The deity is a <b>resting</b> <b>form</b> of Lord Vishnu, {{recumbent}} on the great form of the serpent god Adisesha, {{one of the foremost}} of Hindu Gods. His consort is Goddess Lakshmi, {{also known as}} Ranganayaki [...] His two other consorts seen next to his recumbent figure are Bhudevi and Nila Devi. Most of the deities portray a 'smiling' lord in a reclining position over the celestial serpent Adisesha in the sea of cosmic dissolution (pralaya). This is the form in which he is open to listening to all of his devotee's woes, and blesses them. Apart from being worshipped by all Hindus, this form is of particular importance to the Sri Vaishnava community. His name in Tamil means [...] "leader of the place of assembly", coined from two Tamil words 'Arangam' and 'Nathan'. This temple is of particular interest for scholars in the south because of the vast history attached to it in shaping the religion in the south. However, the lack of proper mention about this temple or Lord Vishnu as [...] "resting on a bed of snake in an ocean of milk" [...] in the [...] "Puranas", the Vishnu Sahasranama or other Sanskrit texts pertaining to North India makes it a center of lesser importance in the north.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{results of}} a reexamination of some poorly {{understood}} peculiarities of laccases, an enzyme family which has been extensively studied in our laboratories {{as well as by}} others for some years. The issue that is reconsidered here is the previously proposed existence of “active” and “resting” forms of laccases. The presence of fungal laccases with partly reduced active sites is demonstrated. Of further interest is that an aggregated state in solution, not to our knowledge previously noted for laccase, has been found by using small-angle X-ray scattering as well as thorough analysis of the results of several biochemical experiments. Under some conditions, this aggregated state may correlate with the <b>resting</b> <b>form</b> of the laccases, although this <b>resting</b> <b>form</b> could have a broader significance. It was shown that Trametes ochracea laccase had some anomalous characteristics, which could be correlated with the high concentration of the “resting” enzyme. The mechanism of formation of resting laccase is suggested. Knowledge of the resting state is of importance for in vitro studies. Additionally, a suggestion about the possible regulatory role of this form in vivo is mentioned...|$|E

40|$|Chicken {{ceruloplasmin}} {{has been}} previously reported to display {{a number of key}} differences relative to human ceruloplasmin: a lower copper content and a lack of a type 2 copper signal by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We have studied the copper sites of chicken ceruloplasmin in order to probe the origin of these differences, focusing on two forms of the enzyme: "resting" (as isolated by a fast, one-step procedure) and "peroxide-oxidized''. From X-ray absorption, EPR, and UV/visible absorption spectroscopies, we have shown that all of the copper sites are oxidized in peroxide-oxidized chicken ceruloplasmin and that none of the type 1 copper sites display the EPR features typical for type 1 copper sites that lack an axial methionine. In the <b>resting</b> <b>form,</b> the type 2 copper center is reduced. Upon oxidation, it does not appear in the EPR spectrum at 77 K, but it can be observed by using magnetic susceptibility, EPR at similar to 8 K, and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy. It displays unusually fast relaxation, indicative of coupling with the adjacent type 3 copper pair of the trinuclear copper cluster. From reductive titrations, we have found that the reduction potential of the type 2 center is higher than those of the other copper sites, thus explaining why it is reduced in the <b>resting</b> <b>form.</b> These results provide new insight into the nature of the additional type 1 copper sites and the redox distribution among copper sites in the different ceruloplasmins relative to other multicopper oxidases...|$|E
