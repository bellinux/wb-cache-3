5|$|The {{presence}} of charge {{gives rise to}} an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity. A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to <b>repel</b> the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also <b>repel</b> each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated {{in the late eighteenth}} century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects <b>repel</b> and opposite-charged objects attract.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{civilian}} vessels produce sonar {{waves in}} order to measure the depth of the body of water in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may <b>repel</b> them. The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.|$|E

5000|$|Motivated by {{the above}} discussion, the {{simplest}} way to define an attracting LCS is by requiring it to be a locally strongest attracting material surface in the extended phase space [...] (see.

Attracting and <b>repelling</b> LCSs together are usually referred to as hyperbolic LCSs, as they provide a finite-time genearalization of the classic concept of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds in dynamical systems.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During a saddle-node {{bifurcation}} {{for real}} analytic interval maps, {{a pair of}} fixed points, attracting and <b>repelling,</b> collide and disappear. From the complex point of view, they do not disappear, but just become complex conjugate. The question is whether those new complex fixed points are attracting or <b>repelling.</b> We prove that this depends on the Schwarzian derivative S at the bifurcating fixed point. If S is positive, both fixed points are attracting; if it is negative, they are <b>repelling.</b> 1...|$|R
