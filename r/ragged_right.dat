5000|$|Line {{length is}} {{determined}} by typographic parameters based on a formal grid and template with several goals in mind; balance and function for fit and readability with a sensitivity to aesthetic style in typography. Typographers adjust line length to aid legibility or copy fit. Text can be flush left and <b>ragged</b> <b>right,</b> flush right and ragged left, or justified where all lines are of equal length. In a <b>ragged</b> <b>right</b> setting line lengths vary to create a <b>ragged</b> <b>right</b> edge of lines varying in length. Sometimes this can be visually satisfying. For justified and <b>ragged</b> <b>right</b> settings typographers can adjust line length to avoid unwanted hyphens, rivers of white space, and orphaned words/characters {{at the end of}} lines (e.g.: [...] "The", [...] "I", [...] "He", [...] "We").|$|E

Justified copy must be adjusted tightly during typesetting to prevent loss of readability, something beyond the capabilities of typical personal computers.|$|E

5000|$|Each design {{done with}} International Typographic Style in mind {{begins with a}} {{mathematical}} grid, because a grid is the “most legible and harmonious means for structuring information.” Text is then applied, most often aligned flush left, <b>ragged</b> <b>right.</b> Fonts chosen for the text are sans serif, a type style believed to “express {{the spirit of a}} more progressive age” by early designers in the movement. Objective photography is another design element meant to present information clearly, and without any of the persuading influences of propaganda or commercial advertising. Such a strong focus on order and clarity is drawn from early pioneers of the movement believing that design is a “socially useful and important activity... the designers define their roles not as artists but as objective conduits for spreading important information between components of society.” ...|$|E

50|$|The International Typographic Style, {{also known}} as the Swiss Style, is a graphic design style that emerged in Russia, the Netherlands, and Germany in the 1920s and was {{developed}} by designers in Switzerland during the 1950s. The International Typographic Style has had profound influence on graphic design {{as a part of the}} modernist movement, impacting many design-related fields including architecture and art. It emphasizes cleanness, readability, and objectivity. Hallmarks of the style are asymmetric layouts, use of a grid, sans-serif typefaces like Akzidenz Grotesk, and flush left, <b>ragged</b> <b>right</b> text. The style is also associated with a preference for photography in place of illustrations or drawings. Many of the early International Typographic Style works featured typography as a primary design element in addition to its use in text, and it is for this that the style is named. The influences of this graphic movement can still be seen in design strategy and theory to this day.|$|E
5000|$|New Wave {{design was}} {{influenced}} by Punk and postmodern language theory. But there is a debate as to whether New Wave is a break or a natural progression of the Swiss Style. Sans-serif font still predominates, but the New Wave differs from its predecessor by stretching the limits of legibility. The break from the grid structure meant that type could be set center, ragged left, <b>ragged</b> <b>right,</b> or chaotic. The artistic freedom produced common forms such as the bold stairstep. The text hierarchy also strayed {{from the top down}} approach of the International Style. Text became textured with the development of transparent film and the increase in collage in graphic design. Further breakdown of minimalist aesthetic is seen in the increase of the number of type sizes and colours of fonts. Although punk and psychedelia embody the anti-corporate nature of their respective groups, the similarity between New Wave and the International Style has led some to label New Wave as “softer, commercialized punk culture.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Tschichold {{was well}} known as an eminent book {{designer}} in his own right, having promoted the now-popular <b>ragged</b> <b>right</b> style of book layout. A modernist, after the war, from 1947 to 1949, he played a hugely significant role in British book design, creating a unified, simple and inexpensive layout design for Penguin Books, a publisher which specialised in issuing cheap paperbacks. In his early life, {{he had lived in}} Leipzig and in the 1920s had devised a [...] "universal alphabet" [...] for German, improving its non-phonetic spellings and promoting the replacement of the jumble of fonts with a simple sans serif. For the German printers, he crafted Sabon as a font that modernized the classics and honed each letter's fine details, particularly the evenness of the serifs. In doing so, Tschichold took careful account of the added weight needed to form a strong impression on modern paper, with mechanized machines subtly [...] "kissing" [...] the surface with ink rather than stamping or rolling it.|$|E

40|$|In a word {{processor}} or in L ATEX, one routinely encounters the “pretty printing ” problem. That is, how does one transform text with a <b>ragged</b> <b>right</b> margin into text whose right margin is as “even” as possible. This write-up discusses the design and analysis of an efficient dynamic program for “pretty printing ” and is composed of four sections. In Section 1, we define the “slack cost ” (the cost associated with printing a set of words on a line) and provide an efficient algorithm for computing it. In Section 2, we apply this algorithm to the general problem of “pretty printing”. The running time and storage requirements of this algorithm are presented in Section 3. Finally, we conclude {{with a discussion of}} the applications and nuances of “pretty printing”. 1 Pre-computing the Slack Cost Table The “pretty printing ” problem has previously been solved using dynamic programming by Donald Knuth for the TEX document preparation system [1, 2]. We follow a similar approach in this writeup – focusing on the merits of a dynamic solution. To begin our analysis, let’s review the formal definition of “pretty printing”. In general, we can represent a piece of text by an array W, whose elements wi are the length of each word in characters. In addition, we can define a general display device by a maximum line length L. To simplify the analysis, we consider the font to be fixed-width and that we are not allowed to break (i. e., hyphenate) words across lines. With these restrictions, a “formatting ” of the text is defined as a partition of W into separate lines. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{will provide}} a process to help graphic design {{scholars}} and historians conduct an evaluation of a designer whose work has been rarely documented within a specific design style. Through implementation of this model of research and evaluation, graphic design scholars {{will not only be}} able to identify that designer 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy and personal style, they will also recognize the value of studying within a specific style of graphic design. This evaluation process includes placing the work of the rarely documented designer beside the work of pioneers in this stylistic idiom in order to highlight similarities of thought, process, form and implementation. The opportunity to do this recently arose with the donation of Swiss designer Fred Troller 2 ̆ 7 s personal collection for inclusion in the Graphic Design Archive at Rochester Institute of Technology. Fred Troller 2 ̆ 7 s work has remained largely undocumented. His work enables this thesis to determine a model by which the work of any rarely documented designer can be placed within an historical context. Rat holds sufficient comparable work within the Graphic Design Archive so that Troller 2 ̆ 7 s work can be substantiated as an integral component of Swiss design, which was known for its strict use of mathematical grids, objectivity, and asymmetrical sans serif typography (flush left, <b>ragged</b> <b>right).</b> The evaluation process this thesis provides will enable the design scholar or historian to better understand an established design idiom. As a consequence, this knowledge can be appropriately applied to a design solution, rather than merely mimicking certain visual elements. For the purpose of this thesis, a Swiss 2 ̆ 7 tool kit 2 ̆ 7 is a metaphor for the design characteristics that must be learned before the designer can explore the characteristics to capture the style of a certain movement. Within this figurative tool kit, a lexicon of Swiss design characteristics can be found. After gaining a better understanding of each syntactical term in the tool kit, the characteristics may be used to enrich the possibilities for solving current graphic design problems...|$|E
