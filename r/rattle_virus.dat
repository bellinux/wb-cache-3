40|$|The passive {{haemagglutination}} and bentonite flocculation tests were compared for detecting plant viruses, using antibody-sensitized tanned red cells or bentonite particles.

In experiments with turnip yellow mosaic virus, extracts from healthy plants of eight species tested {{had little or no}} effect on either test but concentrated extracts from Chenopodium amaranticolor and Spinacia oleracea plants caused non-specific agglutination of unformalinized red cells, and dilute extracts from Petunia hybrida plants decreased eightfold the sensitivity of the passive haemagglutination test. These effects did not occur with formalinized red cells.

5000|$|Tobacco <b>Rattle</b> <b>Virus</b> infects {{hundreds}} of plant species and {{is found in}} every continent where crops are grown.

50|$|Tobacco <b>Rattle</b> <b>Virus</b> can {{be managed}} {{through a variety of}} methods {{designed}} to make the environment unsuitable for transmission and viral propagation. Tubers or seeds of any susceptible plants should be purchased only from sellers certified as clean, and never planted in fields with a history of corky ringspot or Tobacco Rattle Virus-related disease. Many US states and several other countries run seed certification programs, for potatoes in particular. While its use requires a permit from many state or local governments, the nematicide 1,3-dichloropropene may be employed against fields overrun by stubby root nematodes, a common vector of the virus. Soil fumigants generally fail to penetrate the 40 inches necessary to ensure nematode eradication, and carmabates such as aldicarb and oxamyl are recommended as a last resort. Tobacco <b>Rattle</b> <b>Virus</b> is only found in nature in association with stubby root nematodes of genera Trichodorus and Paratrichodorus. Although otherwise considered harmless, they spread the infection during feedings. Nematodes may live and multiply within weeds in the field in between crop rotations, and it is advisable to employ non-host plants, such as alfalfa, to compete against weeds that may otherwise harbor the viral vector. In contrast, nightshade is a very problematic weed as it is an ideal host for the virus and the nematode. Growers can reduce symptom development by planting early and harvesting early. While the Russet Burbank cultivar proves to be highly susceptible to Tobacco <b>Rattle</b> <b>Virus</b> corky ringspot, Merrimack and several old European varieties exhibit resistance. Too much soil moisture can encourage nematode overpopulation, but tightly packed fine soil, clay, or sand can drastically inhibit the vector movement responsible for widespread and erratic field decimations. Once a plant is infected it cannot be treated and should be burned or disposed of as biohazard waste.|$|E

The nematode also introduces viruses to plants, including tobacco <b>rattle</b> <b>virus,</b> which causes the disease corky ringspot in potatoes.

50|$|Tobacco <b>Rattle</b> <b>Virus</b> is {{dependent}} on the nematodesâ activity. Therefore, environmental factors that support nematodesâ movement or life cycle would lead to successful dispersal of this virus. One such environmental inducer is high soil moisture. Nematodes are obligate parasites; this means the nematode requires a host to survive. High soil moisture enables the nematodes to move more easily in the soil. With high soil moisture, nematodes also have better access to the root or root hairs, which enables them to easily transmit the pathogen on those cells. Moderately warm temperature allows faster life cycle of the nematode; If temperature were at optimum for nematodeâs life cycle, there would be a greater chance of dispersal of Tobravirus along the host plant.|$|E
50|$|Tobacco <b>Rattle</b> <b>Virus</b> is a Tobravirus on plants. Transmission of Tobravirus {{is mostly}} {{supported}} by nematodes, such as Trichodorus and Paratrichodorus. These species of nematodes {{are known as}} stubby root nematodes. Transmission of the virus is separated into four distinct steps: Acquisition, absorption, retention, and virus particle release. At {{the beginning of the}} feeding cycle, the Stubby-Root Nematode punctures multiple individual cells by using its specialized stylet, an onchiostyle. Among those penetrated cells, the nematode select a cell which it will feed on. Upon selection, the nematodes begin sucking up cell contents, leading to death of the cell. During this process, adsorption of Tobravirus begins, the process where cytoplasm of infected cells containing Tobravirus is assimilated into the nematodes. Both juvenile and adult nematodes can pick up Tobravirus particles. Once the Tobravirus has been transferred into the nematodes, the retention portion of the lifecycle begins. Tobravirus consumed by the nematodes could linger in the nematodes for years. Eventually, the nematode loaded with Tobravirus starts its feeding cycle on uninfected root cell. During this period, Tobravirus will be transferred into the new cell, completing the virus transmission.|$|E

40|$|A near {{full-length}} cDNA clone {{of tobacco}} <b>rattle</b> <b>virus</b> (TRV) RNA- 1 was constructed by joining together nine overlapping cDNA clones using restriction {{sites in the}} regions of overlap.

Extraneous non-viral nucleotides had been deleted from the 3 ' end of the TRV cDNA to create a unique Sinai site in pTR 7116 in which the nucleotides CCC were provided by the viral cDNA, and GGG by the vector. As a result, pTR 7116 could be linearized with SmaI and transcribed in vitro to yield RNA molecules with 5 ' and 3 ' termini identical to those of natural TRV RNA- 1.

The phenomenon occurred with three different strains of RRV but not when tobacco mosaic virus, or two other strains of tobacco <b>rattle</b> <b>virus,</b> were substituted for the CAM strain. The RRV antigen aggregates were produced only in protoplasts hat synthesized TRV-CAM nucleoprotein, and they seemed not to result from enhanced accumu-lation of RRV.

Aggregation seems to result from a reaction that increases hydrophobicity and not from electrostatic attraction of particles of opposite charge. It is concluded that the production of these aggregates in vivo results from a redistribution of RRV particles or coat protein within the proto-plast or cell, and that this occurs because of the affinity between RRV particle antigen and TRV-CAM nucleoprotein, the longer particles of which accumulate predominantly onthe surface of mitochondria...|$|E
