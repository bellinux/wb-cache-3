30|$|The {{metamaterial}} {{is applied}} to design a <b>radome.</b> By optimizing the structure parameters of the <b>radome</b> [15], the transmission coefficient of the plane <b>radome</b> is close to 1, and the degradation is almost invisible.

25|$|Since 1943 the Lockheed Constellation {{had been}} in USAAF service as the C-69. The use of the Constellation by the U.S. Navy for patrol and {{airborne}} early warning duties was first investigated in 1949, when the Navy acquired two Lockheed L-749 Constellations. First flown on 9 June 1949, the PO-1W carried large, long-range radars in massive <b>radomes</b> {{above and below the}} fuselage. As the <b>radomes</b> possessed considerably more side area, the vertical stabilizers of the PO-1W had to be enlarged. After the PO-1W, which was redesignated WV-1 in 1952, had proved {{that it was possible to}} operate large radars on aircraft, the U.S. Navy ordered the WV-2 based on the L-1049 Super Constellation. The WV-1s were later transferred to the Federal Aviation Agency in 1958–1959.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the hybrid}} {{physical}} optics/boundary integral-finite element-mode matching (PO/BI-FE-MM) method is {{proposed for the}} analysis of the horn antenna enclosed by the electrically large <b>radome.</b> The <b>radome</b> is modeled by the PO method, and the BI-FE-MM method is implemented to the horn region. The equivalent PO currents on the <b>radome</b> surface are coupled into the BI-FE-MM equation of the horn region to account for the effects of the <b>radome</b> on the horn. With this hybrid method, the mutual interactions between the <b>radome</b> and the horn are fully considered. The radiation patterns, field distributions, and the S-parameters of the horns enclosed by different kinds of <b>radome</b> are presented. 1...|$|R
30|$|The above {{simulation}} results illuminate that, the <b>radome</b> {{leads to the}} degradations of radiation characteristics, {{and so does the}} offset focus. However, if the <b>radome</b> and the offset focus exist at the same time with appropriate values, the respective degradation of <b>radome</b> or offset focus can be significantly reduced. That means that the offset focus can compensate the degradation caused by <b>radome,</b> especially for sidelobe-level and nulling depth.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{broadband}} {{interactions between}} an antenna and a <b>radome</b> are modelled using a full wave numerical solver. By accurately describing both the antenna and the <b>radome</b> geometry {{with a single}} numerical method, a comprehensive prediction {{of the performance of}} the coupled antenna and <b>radome</b> installation is provided. The paper compares how different airborne dielectric <b>radome</b> profiles affect the antenna performance, predicting effects not seen in uncoupled simulations...|$|R
25|$|A {{military}} {{version of}} the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation, {{it was designed to}} serve as an airborne early warning system to supplement the Distant Early Warning Line, using two large <b>radomes,</b> a vertical dome above and a horizontal one below the fuselage.

25|$|F4U-4E and F4U-4N: Developed late in WWII, these night fighters {{featured}} radar <b>radomes</b> {{projecting from}} the right wingtip. The -4E was fitted with the APS-4 search radar, while the -4N was fitted with the APS-6 type. In addition, these aircraft were often refitted with four 20mm M2 cannons similar to the F4U-1C. Though these variants would not see combat during WWII, the night fighter variants would see great use during the Korean war.|$|E
25|$|Radar became {{small enough}} to be carried on board aircraft, but the fragile feed horns and reflectors needed to be {{protected}} and streamlined from the airstream. Moulded <b>radomes</b> were constructed, using the Perspex acrylic plastic that was already in use for cockpit windows. This could be heated to soften it, then moulded or vacuum formed to shape. Other polymers developed at this time, notably Nylon, found uses in compact radio equipment as high-voltage insulators or dielectrics.|$|E

This new <b>radome</b> consists of three layers including metal goblets-shape the frequency selective surface (FSS) layer, a substrate and a resistive square loops. Compared with the traditional invisible <b>radome,</b> the new <b>radome’s</b> two absorptive bands were separated by one transmission band, which is a challenge for the traditional ones.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the current}} {{distribution}} on a <b>radome</b> {{can be used to}} improve <b>radome</b> design, detect manufacturing errors, and to verify numerical simulations. In this paper, the transformation from near-field data to its equivalent current distribution on a surface, ie the <b>radome,</b> is analyzed. The transformation is based on the surface integral representation that relates the equivalent currents to the near-field data. The full vector formulation is used in the analyzis but the numerical results are limited to the scalar approximation. It is shown that defects on the <b>radome,</b> not localized in the measured near field, are focused and detectable on the <b>radome</b> surface...|$|R
