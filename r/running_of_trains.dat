5|$|In February 1832 Etty began a {{campaign}} of writing to local York newspapers urging {{the preservation of the}} walls, and sending donations to various campaigns associated with their retention. Although some local newspapers were now supporting preservation in light of the damage their demolition would do to the tourist trade, many locals—whose lives were made more difficult by living in a walled city with few points of entry—remained hostile to the preservation campaigns. A proposal in 1838 by the York and North Midland Railway to cut an archway through the walls to allow access to a railway station within the walls galvanised Etty, and he delivered two lectures on the preservation of the walls during visits to York in 1838–39, and made four paintings of the Bars. Etty's words went unheeded and the archway was duly cut in the walls, much to his dismay, although the station was soon moved to its current location outside the walls to allow through the <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> to both north and south. While the walls were eventually saved in 1889, many years after Etty's death, Etty is sometimes credited with their salvation. It is open to debate how significant his part was. Some authors feel that his interventions had no impact and the preservation of the walls was the result of decisions made by the Corporation and lobbying by local newspapers, while others feel that the Corporation would not have made these decisions had Etty and other like-minded dignitaries not put pressure on them to do so.|$|E
500|$|With the MR {{extension}} to Aylesbury approved, in March 1883 the Duke announced his own scheme {{to extend the}} Tramway to Oxford. The turntable at Quainton Road would {{be replaced by a}} junction to the south of the turntable to allow through <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains.</b> The stretch from Quainton Road to Brill would be straightened and improved to main-line standards, and the little-used stations at Waddesdon Road and Wood Siding would be closed. From Brill, the line would pass in a [...] tunnel through Muswell Hill to the south of Brill, and on via Boarstall before crossing from Buckinghamshire into Oxfordshire at Stanton St. John, calling at Headington on the outskirts of Oxford and terminating at a station to be built in the back garden of 12High Street, St Clement's, near Magdalen Bridge.|$|E
500|$|With {{extension}} to Aylesbury approved, the Duke of Buckingham in March 1883 announced his own scheme {{to extend the}} Brill Tramway to Oxford. The turntable at Quainton Road would be replaced with a junction {{to the south of}} the existing turntable to allow through <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains.</b> The stretch from Quainton Road to Brill would be straightened and improved to main line standards, and Waddesdon Road and Wood Siding stations would close.

From Stanton St. John the line would stop on the outskirts of Oxford at Headington, terminating at a station to be built in the back garden of 12High Street, St Clement's, near Magdalen Bridge. The proposal included a separate set of rails to be provided where the old and new routes ran together, to allow the existing Wotton Tramway to continue to operate independently if it saw fit, but given the Duke's involvement in the new scheme it is unlikely he intended to use this option.|$|E

2500|$|Between April 11 and June 19, 2013, the {{railroad}} {{was in a}} crisis following the collapse of Tunnel #1 on April 11. The financially strapped railroad sought donations for $300,000 to hire an outside company to remove the blockage. Had the funding not been raised, the cash-starved railroad would have shut down. On June 19, a Redwood tree conservation group announced they would buy all of the Redwood trees along the 40-mile right-of-way, and would pay {{the railroad}} well more than their goal for the trees. The railroad resumed full service in August. Tunnel #1 was once again closed in 2016 after sustaining damage from the 2015-16 El Nino, but the railway was in a better position, having equipment at the Willits {{end of the line}} (which was not the case during the 2013 crisis) to allow the <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> to Northspur; trains from the Fort Bragg end are limited to running on a seven-mile trip officially called the [...] "Pudding Creek Express"; no announcements regarding the status of Tunnel #1 have been made recently, though they are fully committed to its reopening.|$|E
60|$|But {{the proper}} unit in most {{economic}} questions, {{and also in}} most questions that are intimately concerned with personal opinions, is not geographical at all. The internal management of railways {{ought not to be}} in the hands of the geographical state, for reasons which we have already considered. Still less ought it to {{be in the hands of}} a set of irresponsible capitalists. The only truly democratic system would be one which left the internal management of railways in the hands of the men who work on them. These men should elect the general manager, and a parliament of directors if necessary. All questions of wages, conditions of labor, <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains,</b> and acquisition of material, should be in the hands of a body responsible only to those actually engaged in the work of the railway.|$|E
6000|$|In {{this way}} the [...] "wasting" [...] of a vote, or the {{rejection}} of a candidate for any reason except that hardly anybody wants him, become practically impossible. This method of the single transferable vote with very large constituencies and many members does, in fact, give an entirely valid electoral result; each vote tells for all it is worth, and {{the freedom of the}} voter is only limited by the number of candidates who put up or are put up for election. This method, and this method alone, gives representative government; all others of the hundred and one possible methods admit of trickery, confusion and falsification. Proportional Representation is not a faddist proposal, not a perplexing ingenious complication of a simple business; it is the carefully worked out right way to do something that hitherto we have been doing in the wrong way. It is no more an eccentricity than is proper baking in the place of baking amidst dirt and with unlimited adulteration, or the <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> to their destinations instead of running them without notice into casually selected sidings and branch lines. It is not the substitution of something for something else of the same nature; it is the substitution of right for wrong. It is the plain common sense of the greatest difficulty in contemporary affairs.|$|E

60|$|Sabotage is the {{practice}} of doing bad work, or spoiling machinery or work which has already been done, {{as a method of}} dealing with employers in a dispute when a strike appears for some reason undesirable or impossible. It has many forms, some clearly innocent, some open to grave objections. One form of sabotage which has been adopted by shop assistants is to tell customers the truth about the articles they are buying; this form, however it may damage the shopkeeper's business, is not easy to object to on moral grounds. A form which has been adopted on railways, particularly in Italian strikes, is that of obeying all rules literally and exactly, {{in such a way as}} to make the <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> practically impossible. Another form is to do all the work with minute care, so that in the end it is better done, but the output is small. From these innocent forms there is a continual progression, until we come to such acts as all ordinary morality would consider criminal; for example, causing railway accidents. Advocates of sabotage justify it as part of war, but in its more violent forms (in which it is seldom defended) it is cruel and probably inexpedient, while even in its milder forms it must tend to encourage slovenly habits of work, which might easily persist under the new regime that the Syndicalists wish to introduce. At the same time, when capitalists express a moral horror of this method, it is worth while to observe that they themselves are the first to practice it when the occasion seems to them appropriate. If report speaks truly, an example of this on a very large scale has been seen during the Russian Revolution.|$|E
