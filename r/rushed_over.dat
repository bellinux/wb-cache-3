5|$|Throughout {{the spring}} of 1918, the 18th Battalion was {{involved}} in operations to repel the German offensive. Maxwell took part in these actions until he was granted leave {{and went back to}} England on 17 July. He returned to France and rejoined the 18th Battalion on 1 August, before taking part in the Battle of Amiens where he was to earn a Bar to his Military Cross. On 9 August, the battalion was preparing to attack near Rainecourt. Maxwell took command of the company after all of its other officers became casualties. Under his leadership, the company was able to attack on time, despite being subjected to heavy fire. A tank that preceded the advance immediately became the object of enemy fire and was knocked out by a 77mm gun. Maxwell, who was in close proximity, <b>rushed</b> <b>over</b> and opened the hatch, allowing the crew to escape. After escorting the tank commander to safety, Maxwell returned to lead the company in the attack, which succeeded in reaching and consolidating their objective. The award of the bar was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 1 February 1919.|$|E

25|$|Playing in the UEFA Champions League {{round of}} 16 away against Porto, he {{suffered}} another injury, {{this time to}} his ankle, and was set to miss the 2007 League Cup Final against Arsenal, but managed {{to recover from the}} injury within days and played in the final. During {{the second half of the}} match, at an attacking corner, he threw himself at the ball with a diving header; Arsenal's Abou Diaby, in an attempt to clear the ball, kicked Terry in the face. Terry was unconscious for several minutes, at which point he nearly swallowed his tongue. He was carried off the field on a stretcher and immediately transferred to the University Hospital of Wales. Terry discharged himself the same day and returned to the Millennium Stadium to celebrate his team's 2–1 win. The only recollection he had of the second half is walking out onto the pitch and he did not remember the ten minutes he played prior to his injury. Following the incident, Terry thanked the Arsenal physiologist Gary Lewin for saving his life. Lewin was the first medic that <b>rushed</b> <b>over</b> to assist him after his tongue had blocked his airways. After spending two weeks on the sidelines, he made his return to the Chelsea team against Blackburn Rovers in March. He went on to lead Chelsea to the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League, the third time in four years that Chelsea had made it to the final four of the competition. In May 2007, Terry captained Chelsea to the FA Cup, in the first final at the new Wembley Stadium.|$|E
500|$|The {{outbreak}} of war {{resulted in a}} shortage of qualified officers, due to which Manekshaw, among others, received promotions to acting or temporary rank; by August 1940, he was an acting captain and then an acting major. He was promoted to the temporary rank of captain on 1 August 1940 and to war-substantive captain on 20 February 1941. During World War II, then-Captain Manekshaw saw action in Burma in the 1942 campaign at the Sittang River with the 4th Battalion, 12th Frontier Force Regiment, and had the rare distinction of being honoured for his bravery on the battlefield itself. During the fighting around Pagoda Hill, a key position on {{the left of the}} Sittang bridgehead, he led his company in a counter-attack against the invading Imperial Japanese Army and despite suffering 50% casualties it managed to achieve its objective. After capturing the hill, Manekshaw was hit by a burst of light machine gun fire and was severely wounded in the stomach. Observing the battle, Major General David Cowan, commander of the 17th Infantry Division, spotted Manekshaw holding on to life and, having witnessed his valour in the face of stiff resistance, <b>rushed</b> <b>over</b> to him. Fearing that Manekshaw would die, the general pinned his own Military Cross ribbon on him saying, [...] "A dead person cannot be awarded a Military Cross." [...] The official recommendation for the MC states that the success of the attack [...] "was largely due to the excellent leadership and bearing of Captain Manekshaw." [...] This award was made official with the publication of the notification in a supplement to the London Gazette on 21 April 1942 (dated 23 April 1942).|$|E

Donaire took a right to the head from Montiel, then immediately countered with a left to the head that knocked his opponent down. Montiel rose to continue before Donaire <b>rushed</b> <b>over</b> to land a left and a right. The referee, Russell Mora, stopped the fight {{in the second}} round (2:25). Donaire became the second Filipino and the third Asian person to become a three-division world champion. Donaire was given a third place in Ring Magazine's [...] "pound for pound" [...] rankings. Juan Manuel Marquez and Sergio Martinez were ahead of him.|$|E

Reid replied that he was badly hurt, {{but he managed to}} roll off his gun. Except for two empty shells and one unexploded cartridge, it was empty. Reid died from his wounds 12 days later. Despite the fact that Reid's own {{reputation}} was far from untarnished, his funeral was the largest in Skagway's history and his gravestone was inscribed with the words [...] "He gave his life for the honor of Skagway." [...] On July 14, 1898, six days after the robbery and gunfight, John Stewart's gold was found by vigilantes inside Soapy's trunk located in an outbuilding behind Jeff Smith's Parlor. All of the gold, minus $600, was there.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{before the}} full plan could be carried out, troopers startled the Indian pony herd and they stampeded {{through the village}} neighing the alarm to Indians, who cut {{their way out of}} tipis for an escape to the hills. [...] Since all chance for a total {{surprise}} was lost, Mills ordered the immediate charge with Schwatka and his twenty-five men. Schwatka, joined by Grouard, Captain Jack and Strahorn thereupon charged and followed the ponies into the village firing pistols into the lodges. [...] "Immediately, the dismounted detachments closed on the south side and commenced firing on the Indians." [...] "The fleeing warriors managed to unleash one or two volleys at the soldiers, and Lieutenent Van Luettwitz’s fell almost immediately, a bullet shattering his right kneecap as he stood on the knoll next to Mills. [...] Instantly Captain Jack <b>rushed</b> <b>over,</b> tearing off the neckerchief he wore and fashioning a tourniquet about Van Luettwitz’s wounded leg to check the flow of blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{highlights}} of the USO tour for Block was meeting General Eisenhower in Algiers during the North African campaign. However, Block almost missed out on the meeting and required some assertive action on Block's part. Block was working on the rehearsal of a USO show when at one point realized the rest of Hope's group had disappeared. Block was enraged when he discovered they had left him behind while they went to meet General Eisenhower. Block <b>rushed</b> <b>over</b> to the hotel serving as Eisenhower's headquarters, only to see Hope's entire group descending the stairs, each with an autographed picture of the General. Block talked his way into meeting the General by telling Harry Butcher, at the time Naval Aide to Eisenhower, [...] "Butch, the one keepsake I want out of this war is an autographed picture of the General for my grandkids." [...] Block met General Eisenhower, introduced as [...] "a man who helps make Bob Hope funny." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{only two}} rounds {{left and the}} last three M13/40s {{pressing}} on, Lieutenant Toms left the gun to drive a Jeep to the nearest knocked-out gun for ammunition and arrived back at the gun through machine-gun fire, which set the petrol tank alight. Turner and an NCO <b>rushed</b> <b>over</b> to help unload the Jeep, by when the tanks were [...] away, firing machine-guns at the gun crew. Sergeant Calistan, the gun-layer, hit the three tanks and set them on fire, from which none of the crews escaped. After the attack, a lull fell apart from shelling which caused more casualties. Turner had been wounded unloading the Jeep but visited the gun positions, until effect of his wounds became too serious; by [...] most of the officers were casualties and the guns were commanded by wounded NCOs. Briggs ordered forward the 2nd Armoured Brigade artillery, the 11th RHA and they drove their M7 Priests up {{the east side of}} the ridge, to bombard Axis positions but managed to hit Snipe again, with 105 mm howitzer fire.|$|E
2500|$|Marshall {{received}} attention for an attempted touchdown celebration during the Broncos' 34–30 comeback road {{victory over the}} Cleveland Browns in a Thursday Night Football matchup on November 6, 2008. With over a minute left in the game, Marshall caught the go-ahead touchdown pass {{and then began to}} pull a glove from his pants. Denver wide receiver Brandon Stokley <b>rushed</b> <b>over</b> to Marshall to urge him to put the glove away, as it could be considered a touchdown celebration prop, which is against NFL rules (a 15-yard penalty on the kickoff could be assessed). Marshall later explained that he was intending to put on the glove (which was white with one half of it painted black) as a means to honor racial progress and unity in the United States, following the country electing Barack Obama as President two days earlier. Regarding the attempted touchdown celebration, Marshall said, [...] "I know at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised that black glove and that fist as a silent gesture of black power and liberation. Forty years later, I wanted to make my own statement. I wanted to make my own statement and gesture to represent the progress we made." [...] Smith and Carlos didn't initially see Marshall's attempted gesture when it happened live, but both said they appreciated and understood Marshall's intent. [...] "He wanted to make a mark in history and feel that he {{was a part of the}} change for the better," [...] Smith said. [...] "He had the right idea in terms of what he was attempting to do," [...] Carlos said.|$|E
