40|$|Haemorrhagic {{gastroenteritis}} is {{a commonly}} seen disease in all breed and age groups of dogs having multiple etiologies. In dogs, Canine Distemper (CD) infection results in gastrointestinal signs, and/or <b>respiratory</b> <b>sign,</b> frequently with {{central nervous system}} involvement (Apple, 1987). A total of 100 dogs were screened for incidence of CD infection diagnosed by standard ready kit, out of which 9 were found positive for canine distemper virus infection. Young dogs was more affected and contributed highest % (55. 56) of all CDV diagnosed cases. Males were more prone for CDV infection than female.

40|$|Background: A {{departmental}} audit in March 2015 {{revealed significant}} mortality rate of 40 % in blunt chest trauma patients (much {{greater than the}} global 25 %). A study was thus planned to study morbidity and predictors of mortality in blunt chest trauma patients admitted to our hospital. Methods: This study was a prospective observational study of 139 patients {{with a history of}} blunt chest trauma between June 2015 and November 2015 after the Institutional Ethics Committee approval in April 2015. The sample size was calculated from the prevalence rate in our institute from the past medical records. Results: The morbidity factors following blunt chest injuries apart from pain were need for Intensive Care Unit stay, mechanical ventilation, and pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome. Significant predictors of mortality in our study were SpO 2 16, and need for mechanical ventilation. By calculating the likelihood ratios of each <b>respiratory</b> <b>sign,</b> a clinical score was devised. Conclusion: The modifiable factors affecting morbidity and mortality were identified. Mild to moderate chest injury due to blunt trauma is difficult to diagnose. The restoration of respiratory physiology has not only significant implications on recovery from chest injury but also all other injuries. It is our sincere hope that the score we have formulated will help reduce mortality and morbidity after further trials...|$|E

40|$|This second Small Animal Disease Surveillance report {{focuses on}} syndromic {{surveillance}} of i) respiratory disease in veterinary practice and ii) feline calicivirus (FCV) based on laboratory diagnosis, {{in a large}} veterinary-visiting pet population of the UK between January 2014 and December 2015. Presentation for respiratory disease comprised 1. 7 %, 2. 3 % and 2. 5 % of canine, feline and rabbit consultations, respectively. In dogs, the most frequent <b>respiratory</b> <b>sign</b> reported was coughing (71. 1 % of consultations), whilst in cats it was sneezing (42. 6 %). Cats had a higher number of geographical regions at high relative risk for respiratory disease compared with dogs in England and Wales. The mean percentage of samples testing positive for FCV was 30. 1 % (95 % CI: 28. 2 – 32. 2 %) in the year 2014 and 27. 9 % (95 % CI: 26. 2 – 29. 7 %) in 2015. January was the month with {{the highest percentage of}} FCV positive samples in both years. The report also gives an update on influenza A virus in dogs and cats.

40|$|Background: This {{retrospective}} {{study was designed}} to determine the trend of neonatalgroup B streptococcal (GBS) infection during the past 7 years at the ChangGung Memorial Hospital of Kaohsiung, as well as to assess the risk factors,clinical features and patient outcomes. Methods: Medical records of infants with neonatal GBS infection identified by positiveresults of cultures of sterile body fluid in our hospital from January 1996 through December 2002 were reviewed for demographic and clinical data. Results: There were 33 infants with neonatal GBS infections during the past 7 yearsin our hospital. The number of patients increased from 1996 to 2001. Sixteeninfants had early onset infections and 17 infants had late onset infections. Ofthe nine patients with maternal risk factors in the early onset group, prolongedrupture of membranes (7, 44 %) was most frequently encountered. Distressed <b>respiratory</b> <b>sign</b> (8, 50 %) was the most common clinical presentationin early onset group, while fever > 38 °C (17, 100 %) was the most commonpresentation in late-onset group. The mortality rates were 13 % and 6 %in early and late onset groups, respectively. Gestational age (p= 0. 05) andpneumonia (p = 0. 015) were two most important factors influencing the mortalityrate. Conclusions: The number of GBS-infected infants seemed to have increased during thepast 7 years in our hospital. Because the incidence of neonatal GBS infectionand maternal colonization in Taiwan has not been collected, we could notdetermine the necessity of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.

40|$|History and Objectives: Streptococcal pharyngitis is {{prevalent}} {{and without}} timely {{diagnosis and treatment}} of the disease, secondary side effects such as acute rheumatic fever and glumerulonephritis will ensue. In addition irrational uses of antibiotics will lead to resistance types. On the basis of WHO recommendation for the diagnosis of the infection, the present study was performed to asses the diagnostic value of clinical findings of patients referred to the Outpatient Clinic of Kashan in winter of 1996. Materials and Methods: The present study is a diagnostic clinical trial in nature. Patient complaining from sore throat was and having a fever of 38 Â°C or higher and having minimum of 2 sign of typical six signs (Sore throat, exudate, lymph node sensitivity, redness of throat, petechia of mouth, ulceromembranous pharyngitis) are considered as having Streptococcal pharyngitis and those with <b>respiratory</b> <b>sign</b> (Caught, roughness of voice, runny nose and conjunctivitis) are considered as viral pharyngitis. From the later group sample were taken and inoculated on blood agar culture. On the basis of clinical findings and laboratory testing, the rate sensitivity and specificity of clinical findings on the diagnosis of Streptococcus pharyngitis was assessed. Results: From 400 cases, sensitivity of the clinical findings for the diagnosis of Streptococcus pharyngitis was 71. Specificity, positive predictive value (Clinical value) and negative predictive values were 23, 7. 8 and 89. 1 respectively. Conclusion: In light of present results, diagnosis of Streptococcus pharyngitis on the basis of clinical findings alone is not suggested. Further research into the underlying causes of poor result on the clinical diagnostic values is suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} Pernambuco {{is the largest}} {{producer}} of eggs in the North and Northeast of Brazil and second one in the broiler production. Mycoplasmas are important avian pathogens, which cause respiratory and joint diseases that result in large economic losses. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the occurrence of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) in broilers and commercial laying hens in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Tracheal fragments were analyzed from 55 healthy broilers, 35 broilers with <b>respiratory</b> <b>signs</b> and 30 commercial laying hens with <b>respiratory</b> <b>signs,</b> from 24 commercial poultry farms, each sample was composed of a pool of five birds. The bacteriological exam, PCR and nested PCR were used for the detection of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS). All samples were negative in bacteriological isolation. In the PCR analyses, seven samples from birds with <b>respiratory</b> <b>signs</b> were positive for MS and one was positive for MG, the latter of which was confirmed as the MG-F vaccine strain. The occurrence of MS in chickens with <b>respiratory</b> <b>signs</b> may indicate inadequate sanitary management on poultry farms, favoring the propagation of mycoplasmosis...|$|R

40|$|Summary: A {{prospective}} {{observational study}} {{was carried out}} to describe the pattern of pulmonary complications in hospitalized patients with Human Immune-deficiency Virus (HIV) infection at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar between January 2005 to December 2006. One hundred and twenty-four patients which consists 60 males and 64 females, aged between 20 – 60 who met the inclusion criteria formed the subjects for the study. The {{mean age of the}} subjects was 34. 60 + 1. 2 years. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain the demographic data, clinical information and CD 4 lymphocyte count. Radiological analysis of chest was done with the chest X-ray of each subject. Chronic productive cough topped the list of respiratory symptoms (89 %) followed by chest pain (74 %) and dyspnea (62 %). Lung consolidation was the commonest <b>respiratory</b> <b>sign</b> as seen in 44 % of the cases. Hilar lymphadenopathy was seen in (35 %), Pleural effusion (32 %), lung fibrosis (21 %) and finger clubbing (15 %). The clinical and radiological pattern of most patients with chronic cough was highly suggestive of mycobacterial infection such as tuberculosis, although only 40 % of cases had positive Acid Fast Baccilli. The mean CD 4 lymphocyte count level was 174. 8 + 5. 4 cells/l and this may be responsible for the respiratory findings as opportunistic lung infections are said to be commoner at CD 4 count levels below 200 cells/l. However, four patients had mediasternal masses which may suggest neoplasms. Concerted efforts and continuous evaluation of these patients are needed to determine the spectrum of respiratory illnesses among HIV positive patients in Calabar...|$|E
40|$|In August 2006, Belgium {{notified}} {{its first}} cases of Bluetongue (BT), serotype 8, in cattle and sheep. The disease was also observed {{at this time}} in the neighboring countries. The resurgence of BT was observed in Northern Europe in 2007. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare clinical signs of BT observed in 2006 vs 2007 in Belgian cattle. The description of clinical signs was based on the observation of 38 and 39 cows in 2006 and 2007, respectively. BT cases were only included if they were confirmed by one or both laboratory diagnostic tests (competitive ELISA test and/or RT-qPCR). The inventory of clinical signs was made with a standardised clinical form for BT. This form is divided into general, cutaneous, locomotor, digestive, respiratory, neurological and reproductive clinical signs. Case data were summarised to determine changes in clinical presentation of BT between 2006 and 2007. A Fischer’s exact probability test was performed to compare (P< 0. 05) the frequency of clinical signs between the two years. Regarding general clinical signs, hyperthermia and tiredness were more often observed in 2007, compared to 2006. All clinical signs about skin and annexes were not significantly different between the two years. Locomotor signs such as prostration, incapacity to get up, reluctance to move, lameness and amyotrophy were more frequent in 2007. Loss of appetite, difficulties in grasping feed, salivation and drooling were the digestive signs more often observed in 2007. A purulent nasal discharge was the only <b>respiratory</b> <b>sign</b> more commonly observed in 2007. Apathy, generalised weakness and paresis or paralysis were more often encountered in 2007. The most important changes between the two years concerned reproduction. A higher incidence of abortion, premature calving and stillbirth was observed during 2007 outbreak. The frequency of most of the clinical signs of BT was higher in 2007 in Belgian cattle. Confirmed cases of BT in Belgian cattle were only 296 in 2006 compared to 4187 in 2007. These data do not represent the real situation of BT infection because the farmers do not notify all cases. Nevertheless, it seems that the 2007 outbreak was more severe regarding the number of cases and the frequency of clinical signs. The mild winter and wet 2007 summer might have favored the persistence of the vectors. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Intoxication with opiates {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of {{referring}} to emergency departments in Iran. Because <b>respiratory</b> <b>signs</b> are one of the most common and important signs in these patients, this study was designed to evaluate the chest x-ray changes of the patients. Methods: The present study was a cross-sectional one. The changes noted in the Chest X-Ray (CXR) of the patients having been intoxicated with opiates and referred with <b>respiratory</b> <b>signs</b> of intoxication during the one year period between July 2007 till July 2008 to Farshchian Hospital in Hamadan were studied. The data, then, were gathered and analyzed using T and chi-square statistical tests. Results: Out of 1698 patients having referred due to poisoning with drugs and chemical agents, 318 (18. 72 %) patients were admitted due to opiates intoxication. Among them, 214 (67. 29 %) had <b>respiratory</b> <b>signs.</b> 84. 1 % were male and 15. 9 % were female. Their average age was 35. 6. The most important substance used was opium (57. 5 %). Most of the cases (84. 1 %) were due to abuse. The most common physical signs were: miosis (83. 6 %), respiratory distress (74. 8 %), rales & wheezing (67. 3 %). The most common radiographic abnormality was pulmonary edema (14. 5 %). And the most common substance causing pulmonary edema was crack (59. 4 %) revealing a significant statistical difference (p= 0. 001). Conclusion: As expected, one of the most important complications and common causes of death in opiate-poisoned patients was respiratory problems; we suggest that physicians and staffs working in the emergency department be well-trained in management of such patients.
