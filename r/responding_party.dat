5000|$|California written {{discovery}} generally {{consists of}} four methods: Request for Production of Documents, Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Admissions.Responses to California discovery requests are not continuing: the <b>responding</b> <b>party</b> only needs to respond with the facts as known on {{the date of the}} response, and is under no obligation to update its responses as new facts become known. [...] This causes many parties to reserve one or two interrogatories until the closing days of discovery, when they ask if any of the previous responses to discovery have changed, and then ask what the changes are. California depositions are not limited to one day, and objections must be made in detail or they are permanently waived.

40|$|The recent {{amendments}} to Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure created a two-tiered approach to discovery of electronically stored information (â€œESIâ€). Responding parties must produce ESI that is relevant, {{not subject to}} privilege, and reasonably accessible. However, because some methods of storing ESI, such as on magnetic backup tapes and within enormous databases, require substantial cost to access and search their contents, the rules permit parties to designate those repositories as â€œnot reasonably accessibleâ€ because of undue burden or cost. But even despite the difficulty in searching for ESI, the partyâ€™s duty to preserve potentially responsive evidence remains; it simply gains the option to forgo poring over the material. Further, the court might nevertheless compel production if the requesting party demonstrates good cause. Regardless of whether the <b>responding</b> <b>party</b> believes certain documents to be reasonably accessible or not, courts may still require their production. Â Â  In such cases, the court may then choose to order production, but shift the costs of doing so to the requesting party. Â  Throughout this process, the burden and cost of production are central themes. Â Â  Their determination is fluid, varying from case to case and even over time in the same situation.

40|$|Abstract—The {{retrieval}} of digital evidence responsive to discovery requests in civil litigation, {{known in the}} United States as “e-discovery, ” presents several important and understudied conditions and challenges. Among {{the most important of}} these are (i) that the definition of responsiveness that governs the search effort can be learned and made explicit through effective interaction with the <b>responding</b> <b>party,</b> (ii) that the governing definition of responsiveness is generally complex, deriving both from considerations of subject-matter relevance and from considerations of litigation strategy, and (iii) that the result of the search effort is a set (rather than a ranked list) of documents, and sometimes a quite large set, that is turned over to the requesting party and that the <b>responding</b> <b>party</b> certifies to be an accurate and complete response to the request. This paper describes the design of an “Interactive Task ” for the Text Retrieval Conference’s Legal Track that had the evaluation of the effectiveness of e-discovery applications at the “responsive review ” task as its goal. Notable features of the 2008 Interactive Task were high-fidelity human-system task modeling, authority control for the definition of “responsiveness, ” and relatively deep sampling for estimation of type 1 and type 2 errors (expressed as “precision ” and “recall”). The paper presents a critical assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluation design from the perspectives of reliability, reusability, and cost-benefit tradeoffs.

In a series of 4 experiments and 2 pilot studies, we demonstrated that when the generation of counterarguments was easy, negotiators who did not add arguments to their first offers achieved superior results compared with negotiators who used arguments to justify their first offer. We hypothesized and provided evidence that adding arguments to a first offer was likely to cause the <b>responding</b> <b>party</b> to search for counterarguments, and this, in turn, led him or her to present counteroffers that were further away from the first offer...|$|E

Numerous experimental studies found that in asymmetric bargaining, where one party proposes the terms and the other can accept or reject the proposal, low offers are typically rejected. We conduct an experiment where upon acceptance the <b>responding</b> <b>party</b> can apply costly rewards and/or punishments, and find that the likelihood of acceptance increases. The least generous offers have the highest chance to be accepted {{in the presence of}} punishment alone. Proposers are most generous when responders can both reward and punish, and offer least (even compared to the baseline) when responders can only reward.

40|$|Although {{cost-effective}} patent {{enforcement is}} vital to innovation, patent litigation has become increasingly expensive. 1 Courts and the patent bar have attempted to control the cost and complexity of patent cases with some success. The adoption of patent rules in many jurisdictions, beginning in 2000, has improved predictability in patent case management. 2 More recently, the Federal Circuit Advisory Council’s E-Discovery Model Order has helped reduce the problem of excessive e-discovery costs. 3 But problems persist. In many patent cases, {{the sheer number of}} issues presented can be overwhelming. According to one study, litigated patents contain an average of 24 claims and cite 31 prior art references. 4 There is a consensus that the numbers of asserted claims, claim terms, and prior art references in patent cases are often problematically excessive. Cases with over a hundred asserted claims and over a hundred asserted prior art references during discovery are common. The identification of an unmanageable number of products can be a problem too. Lack of discipline by the asserting party in preparing its case is often why excess issues are maintained. The inclusion of superfluous claims and prior art can function to “hide the ball. ” The result is an asymmetric burden on the <b>responding</b> <b>party</b> (and the trial court) because the asserting party often has a better sense of which issues it will ultimately pursue. Excess issues, unsurprisingly, inflate litigation costs. Each unnecessary asserted claim and prior art reference must be analyzed and charted, among...|$|E
40|$|Applying a game-theoretic {{approach}} {{based on}} the classic prisoners 2 ̆ 7 dilemma provides valuable insights into corporate managers 2 ̆ 7 decision-making incentives under existing discovery rules. It demonstrates that the fee structure imposed by current discovery rules leads to inefficiency and motivates corporate litigants {{on either side of}} a controversy to employ abusive discovery practices, although each party would benefit from cooperation. Using this framework, this Article shows how a cost-sharing regime can motivate litigants to engage in cooperative discovery and, as a consequence, facilitate more efficient and less abusive discovery practices. To date, scholars, who have posited that cooperative behavior in the discovery process will ultimately reduce abuse and concomitantly lower costs, have proposed such solutions as completely shifting the cost from the <b>responding</b> <b>party</b> to the requesting party. This will not resolve the problem. Accordingly, this Article argues that a default-rule of equal cost-sharing would realign the strategic incentives of corporate litigants to encourage cooperation as opposed to abuse in discovery. Although the parties currently have the ability to contract around the responder-pay-all default, research has shown that a party who suggests a departure from a default rule is negatively perceived by her opponent. However, a 50 / 50 cost-sharing rule changes the default and allows corporate parties to more effectively bargain because their starting positions are better aligned with their incentives. Evenly dividing the cost of document discovery alters the underlying assumptions of the decision-making process and makes mutual cooperation the only economically advantageous alternative. Tying the cost borne by a requesting party to the cost incurred by the <b>responding</b> <b>party</b> creates, in the language of game theory, a dominant strategy of cooperation. Consequently, it would reduce exposure to uncapped litigation costs, discourage useless discovery requests, reduce overly broad or inappropriately narrow discovery responses, and avoid potential sanctions that may be imposed on corporate litigants for discovery misconduct. The cost and uncertainty that result from increasingly expensive discovery demand a reexamination of the incentives underlying the current rules and the impact on corporate litigants. Part I of this Article considers how document discovery has changed litigation practice. It briefly focuses on the initial change in traditional 2 ̆ 2 paper document 2 ̆ 2 discovery with the evolution of the photocopier and then turns to the electronic discovery revolution. Discovery, even in its paper-based form, has always been prone to excess and abuse. However, advances in information storage have magnified the incentives and opportunities for abuse that flow from a cost-allocation structure that allows parties to externalize discovery costs. Specifically, Part I identifies how modern discovery provides the means by which adversaries may impose expensive and burdensome requests or responses on their opponents, leveraging these tactics to induce premature and misvalued settlements. Part II briefly discusses attempts to ameliorate the discovery dilemma such as the December 2006 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (2 ̆ 2 FRCP 2 ̆ 2). As amended, FRCP 26 (b) (2) (C) enumerates the factors that courts must weigh when deciding whether to use their discretion to shift discovery costs. This Article argues that FRCP 26 (b) (2) (C) does not adequately address the cost of discovery or the ways in which current incentives lead a rational actor to abuse the discovery process. Part III proposes a novel cost-sharing legal regime, {{based on the}} prisoners 2 ̆ 7 dilemma, which would restructure litigant incentives to encourage cost-lowering cooperation. The switch to a cost-sharing default rule would reduce abusive discovery tactics and in turn would improve the ability of corporate managers to assess risks when making litigation and settlement decisions...|$|E
40|$|The {{inclusion}} of Article 141 (former Article 119 EEC) and Article 13 in the EC Treaty and the subse¬quent {{adoption of the}} gender and anti-discrimination Directives provides a comprehensive mechanism for addressing discrimination {{on the grounds of}} racial or ethnic origin, gender, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation accordingly. One of the central aims of these Directives is to widen and strengthen access to effective redress. As the practice reminds us, discrimination can be very difficult to prove, and that is why European Union Member States introduced a mecha¬nism to shift the burden of proof from the claimant to the respondent. The shift in the burden of proof {{is one of the main}} mechanisms which aims to ensure adequate levels of enforcement across the board of the European Union and its correct application is imperative to ensure victims are not deprived of an effective means of enforcing the principle of equal treatment. The shift of the burden of proof based on the principle of effectiveness provides that if the claimant establishes facts from which the presumption of discrimination arises, then the <b>responding</b> <b>party</b> needs to prove that discrimination did not occur. If the respondent fails to discharge the burden of proof, the court must make a finding of unlawful discrimination. This paper elaborates the existing anti-discrimination legislation, specifically provisions dealing with shifting of the burden of proof. The paper analyzes the definition of the principle of the shifting of the burden of proof and its historical development rooted in the gender discrimination case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Furthermore, the paper presents the current situation, especially emphasizing when and how the burden of proof shifts in practice, assessing what evidence may be considered at each stage of the process. Finally, the paper identifies the key challenges in this area.
