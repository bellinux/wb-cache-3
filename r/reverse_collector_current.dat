50|$|With no signal applied, due to {{the current}} mirrors Q3/Q4 & Q5/Q6, the <b>collector</b> <b>currents</b> of Q4 and Q6 will be equal in {{magnitude}} if the <b>collector</b> <b>currents</b> of Q1 and Q2 are also equal in magnitude. Thus, no current will flow into the buffer's input (or equivalently no voltage will be present at the buffer's input). In practice, due to device mismatches the <b>collector</b> <b>currents</b> are unequal and this results in the difference flowing into the buffer's input resulting in an offset at its output. This is corrected by adjusting the input bias or adding offset nulling circuitry.|$|R
50|$|Current gain in {{the common}} emitter circuit is {{obtained}} from the base and the <b>collector</b> circuit <b>currents.</b> Because a very small change in base current produces a large change in <b>collector</b> <b>current,</b> the current gain (β) is always greater than unity for the common-emitter circuit, a typical value is about 50.|$|R

In mode 1 (<b>collector</b> <b>current</b> cut-off) the charge densisty is very nearly zero at 	both emitter and collector. In mode 2 (active) the charge density is positive at 	the emitter and very nearly zero at the collector. In mode 3 (<b>collector</b> <b>current</b> 	saturation) the charge density is very high through out the base layer inc 1 uding 	in {{the vicinity of the}} collector junction，which is forward biased and is therefore 	a very low impedance.

Transistors Q1 and Q2 in Fig. 1 are a matched pair sharing the same emitter and base potentials and therefore have [...] and [...] This is a simple two-transistor current mirror with [...] as its input and [...] as its output. When a current [...] {{is applied to the}} input node (the connection between the base of Q3 and collector of Q1), the voltage from that node to ground begins to increase. As it exceeds the voltage required to bias the emitter-base junction of Q3, Q3 acts as an emitter follower or common collector amplifier and the base voltage of Q1 and Q2 begins to rise. As this base voltage increases, current begins to flow in the collector of Q1. All increases in voltage and current stop when the sum of the <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> of Q1 and base current of Q3 exactly balance [...] Under this condition all three transistors have nearly equal <b>collector</b> <b>currents</b> and therefore approximately equal base currents. Let [...] Then the <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> of Q1 is the <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> of Q2 is exactly equal to that of Q1 so the emitter current of Q3 is [...] The <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> of Q3 is its emitter current minus the base current so [...] In this approximation, the static error is zero.|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} dependence of magnetocurrent in the spin-valve transistor has been theoretically explored based on phenomenological model.
