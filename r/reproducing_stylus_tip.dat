A micro CM M needs a tiny spherical <b>stylus</b> <b>tip</b> with diameter less than 0. 125 mm to measure micro components such as micro slots, micro holes, and micro gears. With combination WEDG technology and one pulse electro discharge (OPED) process, micro spherical <b>stylus</b> <b>tips</b> with 60 μm in diameter has been fabricated successfully. However the time consuming of a long micro electrode tool fabrication is still a critical problem by WEDG technology. In order to fabricate micro ball-ended <b>stylus</b> <b>tips</b> more efficiency, this study presents a new hybrid process with combination micro ECM and OPED to produce micro spherical sty lus tips for micro CMM's probing heads. To fabricate high quality spherical <b>stylus</b> <b>tips,</b> the parameters of micro ECM and OPED such as feeding speed, concentration of electrolyte, and pulse duration will be also investigated in this study. It is expected that micro spherical stylus for CMM's probing heads could be fabricated more efficiency by this hybrid machining process...|$|R

50|$|Blue Amberols have {{a maximum}} playing time of about 4 minutes and 45 seconds and {{play at the}} {{standard}} post-1902 cylinder speed of 160 rpm. Like the preceding black wax Amberols, they provide twice the playing time of 2-minute cylinders by using a finer groove with a pitch of 200 lines per inch instead of 100. They cannot be played on older machines set up to play only the earlier standard 2 minute cylinders, as both wax and celluloid Amberols require a smaller <b>stylus</b> <b>tip</b> to fit the finer groove and the worm-gear which moves the stylus {{over the surface of}} the cylinder must turn at a different rate. Thomas A. Edison, Inc. sold kits with gear assemblies and reproducers that could be installed by the owner of an older Edison machine so that both standard and 4-minute records could be played. The Edison company also marketed new models capable of playing both. With these combination machines the operator needed to adjust a knob or lever that shifted gears and make sure the correct <b>reproducing</b> <b>stylus</b> was in position when switching from one record type to the other.|$|R

Tactile measurement is traditionally considered {{to have the best}} accuracy and traceability. However, tactile measurement can be significantly affected by the mechanical filtering effect. This work sets out to investigate the influence of the mechanical filtering effect of tactile measurement on AM parts. Both experiential and simulation work are unitised to reveal this effect. Particularly the numerical simulation based on the morphological method allows the single influence factor, i. e., the tip diameter to be investigated. The maximum measurement errors caused by the <b>stylus</b> <b>tip</b> mechanical effect are determined by the convex hull points of the measurement profile, which is equivalent to using an infinitely large <b>stylus</b> <b>tip.</b> The CMM and XCT results of measuring the AM cylinder diameters are compared, along with the application of morphological method to “compensate” the mechanical filtering effect of the <b>stylus</b> <b>tip...</b>|$|R

To reduce such errors, this study evaluates the suitability of three cleaning methods (brushing, laser cleaning and snow cleaning) for removing surface contamination on a micro-CMM <b>stylus</b> <b>tip.</b> The cleaning capability of each method is experimentally investigated. Due to the fragile nature of the styli, possible damage (mechanical and thermal) to the tip is assessed.

The advantages are that it is a cheap instrument and has higher lateral resolution than optical techniques, depending on the <b>stylus</b> <b>tip</b> radius chosen. New systems can do 3D measurements in addition to 2D traces and can measure form and critical dimensions as well as roughness. However, the disadvantages are that the <b>stylus</b> <b>tip</b> has to be in physical contact with the surface, which may alter the surface and/or stylus and cause contamination. Furthermore, due to the mechanical interaction, the scan speeds are significantly slower than with optical methods. Because of the stylus shank angle, stylus profilometers cannot measure up {{to the edge of a}} rising structure, causing a [...] "shadow"or undefined area, usually much larger than what is typical for optical systems.|$|R

Instruments that have been developed thus far to avoid the problems with local slope typically suffer from poor measurement height resolution and slow measurement speeds. Contact profilometers such as stylus-based instruments suffer from poor lateral resolution due to the finite radius of the <b>stylus</b> <b>tip,</b> and slow measurement speeds, especially when two-dimensional scans of the surface are required. <b>Stylus</b> <b>tips</b> can also scratch delicate surfaces during the measurement. We propose a new method of optical, non-contact profiling of rough surfaces without the limitations on local slope that other methods suffer from.

50|$|A keel-shaped needle with a {{titanium}} electrode layer rides {{in the groove}} with extremely light tracking force (65 mg) and an electronic circuit is formed through the disc and stylus.

The video and audio signals are stored on the Videodiscs in a composite analog signal which is encoded into vertical undulations {{in the bottom of}} the groove, somewhat like pits. These undulations have a shorter wavelength than the length of the <b>stylus</b> <b>tip</b> in the groove, and the stylus rides over them; the varying distance between the <b>stylus</b> <b>tip</b> and the conductive surface due to the depth of the undulations in the groove under the stylus directly controls the capacitance between the stylus and the conductive carbon-loaded PVC disc.

40|$|Contamination {{adhered to}} the surface of a µCMM <b>stylus</b> <b>tip</b> {{significantly}} impairs the dimensional accuracy of a µCMM system. Regular cleaning of the stylus is essential to minimising the dimensional error but little data exists for determining appropriate cleaning intervals. This study investigates the build-up of contamination on the µCMM <b>stylus</b> <b>tip</b> during probing procedures. Experiments were conducted on surfaces with controlled contamination for 18 different conditions to study the impact of surface morphology and contact pressure. Quantitative results showed that surface texture due to the difference in machining processes was more influential than surface roughness in determining contamination rate, and that higher contact pressure led to greater contamination. However, contamination rate was observed to vary significantly, suggesting a probabilistic mechanism for contamination adhesion. As such, predictive methods may not offer a reliable threshold for determining cleaning intervals. To that end, a technique for on-machine imaging has been proposed to work in-line with the µCMM and inspect surface contamination as it builds. Using epi-illuminated optical microscopy with focus stacking, debris of less than 300 nm in size was detectable...|$|R

A certified reference material BCR- 692 is available for verification purposes. This presents three repeatable failure events at certified critical load intervals and can provide a good indication of overall scratch-test instrument performance, including stylus condition and calibration.
