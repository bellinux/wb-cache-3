5|$|Robert died on 27 February 1167. William fitzStephen, one of Becket's supporters, {{wrote that}} Robert died of grief {{because he was}} unable to visit Becket in exile.

Before his appointment to Hereford, John of Salisbury had praised him, but Robert's conduct during the Becket controversy soured John's attitude towards his old teacher.|$|E

40|$|This study explores how seller reputations affect auction prices, {{and concludes}} that earlier {{findings}} may be biased {{due to the}} misspecification of seller reputation. This paper {{contributes to the literature}} by offering significant empirical evidence using Taiwanese Internet auction data. Our study reveals that the influence of seller <b>reputations</b> <b>on</b> auction prices is significant, irrespective of the assumptions of linear and non-linear relationships with price. However, failure to consider the non-linear setting of seller reputation would have led us to overestimate the impact of <b>reputations</b> <b>on</b> prices because marginal returns to an incremental increase in reputation declines rapidly for sellers who have more than 15 scores. In addition, using quantile regression, this study finds evidence of considerabl...|$|R
5|$|By January 1974, a {{joint working}} party {{representing}} Greater Manchester had drawn up its county Structure Plan, ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county. The highest priority was {{to increase the}} quality of life for its inhabitants by improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisationâ€”much of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century growth, and was unsuited to modern lifestyles. Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in country parks to improve the region's poor <b>reputation</b> <b>on</b> leisure facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and patterns.|$|E

Johnson. The majority on the commission issued a report which concluded that pornography does not degrade the morals of adults or cause crime and recommended that all federal, state, and local laws preventing consenting adults from obtaining pornographic materials be repealed. Keating, Nixon's only appointee on the 18-person commission, was the leading commission dissenter from the report.|$|E
5|$|In March 1916, the {{infantry}} {{units of the}} AIF were transferred from Egypt to Europe for service on the Western Front.

The 2nd Division {{was the first to}} arrive in France, followed by the 1st Division, while the 4th and 5th left Egypt later in June 1916. The 3rd Division was the last to arrive, having been formed in Australia in March 1916, and moving to England for training in July 1916, before being sent to France in December 1916. For the next {{two and a half years}} the constant rotations in and out of the line were punctuated by a number of major battles, during which the Australians earned for themselves a formidable <b>reputation.</b> <b>On</b> 1 November 1917 the Australian divisions were re-grouped together to form the Australian Corps.|$|E

5|$|Most gunfights {{are portrayed}} in films or books as having two men square off, waiting {{for one to}} make the first move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. In popular folklore, men who held {{noteworthy}} reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same <b>reputation.</b> <b>On</b> the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.|$|E
