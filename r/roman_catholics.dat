They were, in fact, regarded as traitors, because the Pope had refused to accept Elizabeth as Queen of England. <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholics</b> were given the hard choice of being loyal either to their church or their country. For some priests it meant life on the run, in some cases death for treason.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} {{struggles of}} the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After {{the passing of the}} Test Act 1672, and with the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of William and Mary over the Jacobites, <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholics</b> and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament. Under the emerging Penal Laws, Irish <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholics</b> and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholics</b> and Protestant Dissenters, while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists. The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the Protestant Ascendancy.|$|E

50|$|Grand Dukes Adolphe (1817-1905) and William IV (1852-1912) were Evangelical Christians.

5|$|The Roman Catholic Church's {{refusal to}} countenance {{occasional}} attendance at Protestant services, {{as well as}} the excommunication of Elizabeth by Pope Pius V in 1570, presented the choice to <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholics</b> more starkly. The arrival of the seminary priests, while it was a lifeline to many <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholics,</b> brought further trouble. Elizabeth's ministers took steps to stem the tide: fines for refusal to attend church were raised from 12d. per service to £20 a month, fifty times an artisan's wage; it was now treason to be absolved from schism and reconciled to Rome; the execution of priests began—the first in 1577, four in 1581, eleven in 1582, two in 1583, six in 1584, fifty-three by 1590, and seventy more between 1601 and 1608. It became treasonable for a Roman Catholic priest ordained abroad to enter the country. Because the papacy had called for the deposing of the Queen, the choice for moderate <b>Roman</b> <b>Catholics</b> lay between treason and damnation.
