40|$|Foreign aid {{donors and}} <b>recipient</b> <b>governments</b> often have {{conflicting}} objectives. Foreign donors may attempt {{to influence the}} policies of <b>recipient</b> <b>governments</b> by offering aid or threatening to suspend aid to sovereign states. This paper considers the credibility of such inducements and the conditioning of aid flows on policy behavior by national governments {{in the presence of}} opposing objectives. Aid can be conditioned on past policy actions of the recipient and used to influence the distribution of government resources in a simple repeated agency model. In equilibrium, aid flows are backloaded and reward <b>recipient</b> <b>governments</b> for donor-preferred policy actions. The model is extended to a stochastic setting to allow for asymmetric information between donors and <b>recipients</b> regarding <b>government</b> resources and accumulation of private of foreign assets. This allows for unobserved capital flight implicitly financed by foreign aid inflows by constituents favored by the government. Conditional aid is still feasible and can be enforced by aid suspensions in the presence of potential capital flight. ...|$|R

We test these competing hypotheses empirically by considering the political ideology of both governments along the left-right spectrum in augmented models on the economic growth effects of aid. Following the estimation approach of Clemens et al. (2012), we find that aid tends to be less effective when political ideology differs between the donor and the recipient...|$|R

These payments are amalgamated into a fund {{that is used to}} further fund development. This can take the form of investments in infrastructure or industry, paying down the debt or deficit, or stabilizing the currency.

For instance, Germany's Marshall Plan counterpart funds were used to set up such an investment fund, and it is still in operation today.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea that}} aid is given {{for a number}} of ulterior agendas is {{supported}} by the academic literature. In a study co-authored by the World Bank, the authors use data on bilateral aid flows reported by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to scrutinize foreign aid, mainly from US, Japan, and France. The study finds that foreign aid decisions by these countries are governed by varying strategic or political factors; such as colonial history for France, business ties for Japan, and influence in the Middle East for the US. This is further discussed in another study that uses selectorate theory to explain foreign aid giving. The authors argue the size of the leader’s support coalition in the <b>recipient</b> <b>government,</b> ranging from the general public to a narrow elite-filled coalition, {{is an important factor in}} aid granting in OECD countries. Governments with narrower coalitions can more easily make concessions to the aid providing state. The study uses bilateral aid transfers from 1960 to 2001 by OECD states as evidence that some countries in fact do give to governments that are better at granting concessions and can be more easily influenced.|$|E

We examine how government discretion should be so constrained when the donor cannot fully control public expenditures, but instead can influence a less disaggregated indicator of public policy, namely the allocation of public spending between the social sectors (e. g. education, health, etc.) {{on the one hand and}} more traditional public goods (e. g. infrastructure) on the other. We first show how budget allocations will be altered when <b>recipient</b> <b>government</b> preferences are known - i. e. we characterize what policies the donor should "buy"- and how a given aid budget should be allocated between different types of countries. When <b>recipient</b> <b>government</b> preferences are not known by the donor, the permitted policies are distorted due to incentive constraints, and the extent to which aid flows are optimally differentiated between different countries is reduced.

This paper propose a new approach to be implemented in the framework of development assistance projects, where an endowment fund could be left by the donor to the <b>recipient</b> <b>government,</b> in order to generate interests which could cover {{at least part of the}} cost of maintenance. It would be interesting to explore the possibility to cover material costs, since the costs concerning human resources in maintenance might be covered by the <b>recipient</b> <b>government,</b> through its technicians and management personnel. Of course, that would represent a big change, since from the beginning of the projects; the donor government should take into consideration what are the main costs for maintenance, since the costs should be covered by the donor itself when the project is other. That would represent a big innovation, since today donors are starting to construct infrastructure without knowing how to cover the infrastructure costs, since <b>recipient</b> <b>government</b> normally lack the resources to implement the necessary infrastructure. That’s what the paper aims at: to provide the theoretical possibility for a big change for the maintenance of infrastructure, by generating the resources and the interest which is necessary to focus on the often forgotten issue of maintenance...|$|E
