40|$|A cracked {{gasket ring}} and a flange {{belonging}} to a <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> <b>joint</b> (RTJ) of hydrocracker unit- 2 {{were sent to the}} laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that the failure was by sulphide stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Analysis suggests that most probably, the SCC was promoted in the components because of formation of polythionic acid in the system in presence of O 2 and/or H 2 O. Compositional analysis showed that the ring and the flange were fabricated from SS 347 and SS 321 steels respectively. The materials were found to conform to specification and they were used in annealed condition. No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the failure. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report, and a few recommendations suggested...|$|E
40|$|Failure of a <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> <b>joint</b> (RTJ) of reactor {{pipeline}} of a hydrocracker {{unit has}} been reported. Cracks were noticed {{on the flange}} {{as well as the}} ring gasket of the RTJ during inspection following a periodic shutdown of the unit. These components of the RTJ were manufactured from stabilized grades of austenitic stainless steel, namely, type 321 and 347, respectively. Study showed that the failure of the RTJ components occurred by transgranular stress corrosion cracking. It was further established that formation of polythionic acid due to presence of H 2 S in the process gas and H 2 O in the system was responsible for initiation of SCC in RTJ components. Detailed metallurgical investigation was carried out to identify the probable causes that could have been responsible for formation of polythionic acid in the process gas...|$|E
40|$|Two fused {{chloride}} salt eutectics, binary LiCl-KCl and ternary NaCl- KCl- MgCl/sub 2 /, {{were used}} in fuel processing studies {{as part of the}} Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor research and development program. Results of engineering work done at Brookhaven since 1950 are summarized. It was demonstrated that fused chloride salt technology is sufficiently developed so that loops and other experimental equipment can be designed and operated at 500 deg C {{with a high degree of}} confidence. The equipment, which was operated for many hours, included a large forced-circulation loop and many thermal-convection loops and tanks. The specifications used for the fabrication, cleaning, and testing of equipment for salt service are described. All welded systems, welded by the usual inert-arc procedures, are preferred, but <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> <b>joint</b> stainless-steel flanged connections were found satisfactory, mainly for connecting melt tanks to experimental equipment and for mounting orifice flowmeters. The surfaces of equipment to be used with fused salts were cleaned satisfactorily prior to assembly by several different methods, but sandblasting was found applicable to all types of equipment. Radiography was used to check all welds in contact with fused salt for flaws and, during operation, to locate and determine the cause of any malfunction. Components tested at the normal operating temperature of 500 deg C included pumps, valves, agitators, sightports, samplers, and filtens. Salt samples were usually taken by the thief method. Both stationary and movable resistance type, liquid-level probes were used and were reliable so long as the salt surface remained quiescent; otherwise, splashing and short-circuiting occurred. Nullmatic, pilot-operated pressure transmitters gave good service in conjunction with both orifice and Venturi flowmeters. A procedure is described for preparing pound quantities of pure eutectics, which, in the case of the ternary eutectic, differs from that used in preparing gram quantities. Both eutectics were pretreated with a Bi- Mg-U solution to remove oxidizing impurities before use in corrosion and processing experiments. The results of physical property measurements on the two eutectics are included. (auth...|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} {{is focused on}} the behavior of a <b>type</b> of <b>joint</b> between hollow sections. A theoretical model is created with the finite element method simulating a beam to column joint. The member which acts as the beam or as the brace of the joint (bi) is the same type of section with the other one act as the column or the chord (bo). Both members are square hollow sections. Firstly, the effect of the shear force due to the bending moment is examined with additionally the effect or the geometric ratio (β = bi/bo) and the thickness ratio (τ = ti/to) in the resistance of normal <b>type</b> <b>joint.</b> According to the parametric analysis followed, the design resistances of these <b>types</b> of <b>joints</b> are compared to those mentioned to EC 3 and those proposed of the research study worldwide in the same <b>type</b> of <b>joints</b> under axial loads. Joints are classified according the pre-mentioned limits for open sections and the resultant moment-rotation curves. An experimental study of these normal joints is made. <b>Joints</b> of “X” <b>type</b> in scale 1 : 1 and geometric ratios β = 0. 66 and β = 1. 0 are examined including 4 moment <b>type</b> <b>joints.</b> In sequence, the previous <b>type</b> of <b>joints</b> are examined with the chord-column member rotated by 45 o consisting a “bird-beak” joint. With the same parametric analysis the effect the geometric ratio (β = bi/bo) and the thickness ratio (τ = ti/to) in the resistance of this new <b>type</b> of <b>joint</b> is examined. The results obtained are compared to those for normal joints and classified according to their strength and rotational stiffness. A formula is proposed for the design resistance of these <b>types</b> of <b>joints.</b> The behavior of these theoretical models which are created with fem is also compared with the experimental results of “b-b” “X” <b>type</b> <b>joints</b> in scale 1 : 1 and geometric ratios β = 0. 66 and β = 1. 0 including 4 new moment <b>type</b> <b>joints.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> piezoelectric actuator that combines a ring-shaped piezoelectric component {{with a thin}} metal disc. In this actuator, the ring-shaped piezoelectric ceramic produces a radial contraction or expansion, and results in a large flexural displacement {{of the center of}} the metal disc. When the PZT ring under the metal disc contracts, the unbounded portion {{at the center of the}} disc is permitted to bend with a larger curve in positive (upper) direction. Both experimental results and FEM analysis support the new concept and confirm that the <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> uni/bimorph (ring-morph) configuration has a larger displacement output than that of conventional disc type uni/bimorph actuators with comparable dimensions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} development of prediction methods for characterizing the electrical behavior of <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> central pattern generators (CPGs). A mathematical model of the prototypical bursting neuron R 15 from the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia is used, along with a simple model of the inhibitory synapse, to form a four neuron ring model of a CPG. The basic mode of a four neuron ring CPG model is able to characterize the walk, trot and bound gaits associated with quadrupedal locomotion. The phase sensitivity of neuron R 15 to an external input is investigated, and the results are expressed in terms of cophase curves that are used to formulate prediction algorithms for the behavior of <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> networks. These prediction algorithms are utilized in a Network Emulator that provides an accurate simulation of the behavior of the <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> networks at a considerable savings in computation time compared with numerical solutions of the ordinary differential equations associated with these networks. We further extend this work by examining the conditions for control of the modes of three and four neuron ring CPGs by external stimuli...|$|R
