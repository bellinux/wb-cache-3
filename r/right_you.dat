With this one everything seemed to come out right. The actors fell in, the photography fell in and the story clicked. I caught a lot of breaks!" ...|$|E
500|$|According {{to project}} manager Lou Cerny of MTH Industries, [...] "When {{the light is}} <b>right,</b> <b>you</b> can't see where the {{sculpture}} ends and the sky begins." [...] The sculpture challenges perception by distorting and deforming the surrounding architecture. The skyscrapers along East Randolph Street to the northeast (Two Prudential Plaza, and Aon Center), north (One Prudential Plaza) and northwest (The Heritage, Crain Communications Building) are reflected on Cloud Gates surface when viewed from either the east or the west. The sculpture also warps viewers' perception of time by changing the speed of movements such as the passing of clouds.|$|E
500|$|Although Island neither {{expected}} nor {{wanted a}} third album, Drake approached Wood in October 1971 {{to begin work}} on what would be his final release. Sessions took place over two nights, with only Drake and Wood present in the studio. The bleak songs of Pink Moon are short, and the eleven-track album lasts only 28 minutes, a length described by Wood as [...] "just about <b>right.</b> <b>You</b> really wouldn't {{want it to be}} any longer." [...] Drake had expressed dissatisfaction with the sound of Bryter Layter, and believed that the string, brass and saxophone arrangements had resulted in a sound that was [...] "too full, too elaborate".|$|E

500|$|According to Darryl Dawkins' autobiography, Bavetta was officiating an NBA game {{during the}} mid-1970s between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets with Earl Strom as his partner for that game. Bavetta {{overruled}} Strom on a crucial last-second personal foul call against the Nets, {{which would have}} been a victory for the 76ers. When the game ended and players were walking to their respective locker rooms, the door to the referees' locker room flew open and Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was allegedly ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom. Strom stepped out into the hallway and hollered after Bavetta, [...] "You'll take another one of my fucking calls again, <b>right,</b> <b>you</b> motherfucker?" [...] Strom was fined for the incident.|$|E
500|$|After {{signing with}} Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left the band; Tintari was {{replaced}} by Brandon Barnes shortly thereafter. [...] With their new drummer, Rise Against began to work on The Unraveling at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana, where Principe and Wleklinski had previously recorded material for 88 Fingers Louie. Recording took place {{over the course of}} five weeks, with Mass Giorgini serving as the producer, and Wleklinski serving as the assistant engineer. Wleklinski later remarked on the grueling workdays: [...] "12-hour days for 4 of those weeks, and then 22-24 hours per day during that last week of tracking. These were the times of 'If you don't play it <b>right,</b> <b>you</b> have to play it again,' not 'That was good enough, I'll edit it so it's on time.'" [...] Wleklinski also commented that it was difficult to split his time between recording guitar parts and engineering the songs, and that during the last week he had to sleep on the studio floor.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team gave bassist Adam Clayton's bass a [...] "low end bass throbbing effect", which the Edge described as [...] "a real stroke of genius from the {{production team}}."

The lyrics [...] " [...] up the personal and the political." [...] Bono noted that [...] "There was some reference to the little death, which {{can be taken to}} mean a faint during orgasm but also works as an image of terrorism." [...] Quoting the lyric [...] "A little death without mourning / No call and no warning / Baby, a dangerous idea / That almost makes sense", he said, [...] "There's nothing more deadly than an idea– or a person– that's almost <b>right.</b> <b>You</b> know, it took the 20th century a hundred years to get over communism.

500|$|... "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{was written}} by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, and Beyoncé. It was {{produced}} by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name, Stargate, and Beyoncé. Eriksen told Sound on Sound, [...] "This song is very simple. Most {{of the time we}} have more chords in a song, because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord. But if you do it <b>right,</b> <b>you</b> can make it work, and this song is an example." [...] The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, Tyran Smith, who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé. Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song. The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote {{a significant part of the}} lyrics and the melody.|$|E
500|$|The pilot episode saw {{a mostly}} {{positive}} reception. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote [...] "...the entertainment value and suspense of Falling Skies is paced just <b>right.</b> <b>You</b> {{get the sense}} that we'll get those answers eventually. And yet, you want to devour the next episode immediately." [...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times called it [...] "...a trustworthy family drama but with aliens." [...] He continued, [...] "It's 'Jericho' meets 'V', with the good from both and the bad discarded. It'll raise the summer-TV bar significantly." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly gave the series a B+ and wrote, [...] "A similar, gradually developed, but decisive conviction makes Falling Skies an engaging, if derivative, chunk of dystopian sci-fi." [...] He continued, [...] "...Falling Skies rises above any one performance; it's the spectacle of humans versus aliens that draws you in." [...] In the Boston Herald, Mark A. Perigard gave the series a B grade, writing [...] "Don't look now, but Falling Skies could be a summer obsession." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{their new}} lineup finalized, Rise Against {{began work on}} their debut studio album, The Unraveling. Recording {{sessions}} took place in late 2000, at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette. Wleklinski served as an assistant engineer under producer Mass Giorgini, and later remarked on the grueling workdays: [...] "12-hour days for 4 of those weeks, and then 22-24 hours per day during that last week of tracking. These were the times of 'If you don't play it <b>right,</b> <b>you</b> have to play it again,' not 'That was good enough, I'll edit it so it's on time." [...] The Unraveling was released on April 24, 2001. Although the album failed to reach any record charts, it did receive positive reviews from critics, who commended the raw and unadulterated music. To promote the album, Rise Against toured extensively throughout North America and Europe. While on tour, Wleklinski left the band due to several complaints from McIlrath. Rumor spread that Wleklinski was fired because of his long hair, although McIlrath derided these claims. Phillip Hill stood in as the lead guitarist while on tour, after which White returned as a replacement.|$|E

500|$|Chandler and the Experience {{found time}} to record between {{performances}} in Europe. They began on October 23, recording [...] "Hey Joe" [...] at De Lane Lea Studios, with Chandler as producer and Dave Siddle as engineer. The song featured backing vocals by the Breakaways. Soon after the session began, Chandler asked Hendrix to turn his guitar amplifier down, and an argument ensued. Chandler commented: [...] "Jimi threw a tantrum because I wouldn't let him play guitar loud enough... He was playing a Marshall twin stack, {{and it was so}} loud in the studio that we were picking up various rattles and noises." [...] According to Chandler, Hendrix then threatened to leave England, stating: [...] "If I can't play as loud as I want, I might as well go back to New York." [...] Chandler, who had Hendrix's immigration papers and passport in his back pocket, laid the documents on the mixing console and told Hendrix to [...] "piss off". Hendrix laughed and said: [...] "All <b>right,</b> <b>you</b> called my bluff", and they got back to work. Redding wrote in his diary that they completed two songs during the October 23 session, but the second one has never been positively identified. Author Sean Egan speculated that it might have been Howlin' Wolf's [...] "Killing Floor" [...] or Wilson Pickett's [...] "Land of a Thousand Dances". Chandler decided that they should use an Experience original for the B-side of the single, so he encouraged Hendrix to start writing; he composed his first Experience song, [...] "Stone Free", the following day. Chandler, in an effort to minimize studio expenses, purchased rehearsal time at the Aberbach House in London. He abandoned this practice after realizing how quickly the group could learn songs while warming up in the studio. On November 2, 1966, the Experience returned to De Lane Lea to continue work on their first single. During the session, they recorded [...] "Stone Free" [...] and a demo version of [...] "Can You See Me". This marked {{the first time that the}} Experience recorded a song that was eventually included on the original UK release of the album.|$|E

Go back and do it <b>right.</b> <b>You</b> don’t {{have to wait till}} they fire before you fire back. Remember I told Laird that. And I meant it. Now Lavelle {{apparently}} knew that, and received that at some time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, however, upon {{meeting with}} the artist at a gallery, Stein's {{attitude}} had apparently changed: [...] "..ah I said catching him by the lapels of his coat and shaking him.[...].'it is all <b>right</b> <b>you</b> are doing this {{to get rid of}} everything that has been too much for you all right all right go on doing it but don't go on trying to make me tell you it is poetry' and I shook him again." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Online, King said that the sixth season [...] "is about answers and closure for all of them. It is an ending to the story that we started so long ago, but it's a very fast-paced ending to the story." [...] As a regard to the first 10 episodes of the season, executive producer Joseph Dougherty said that they [...] "are {{going to be like}} nothing that's ever happened before on this series. It's an incredible amount of information in every episode, but if we've done the job completely <b>right,</b> <b>you</b> should be able to figure the mystery out just before you find out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The race {{restarted}} with 129 laps {{to go and}} a multi-car wreck {{brought out}} the seventh caution of the race. It started when Busch spun out and collected Brad Keselowski. Matt Kenseth, Paul Menard, Ryan Blaney, Jimmie Johnson and Elliott all suffered damage in the wreck. Busch said afterwards {{that he thought he}} [...] "just missed the bottom groove by a few inches, got loose and the wreck was on. The way that our car was restarting it felt comfortable, it felt good. That inside with the rosin and the VHT, if you don’t hit it exactly <b>right</b> <b>you</b> lose a lot of time. I tried {{to make up for it}} and got loose. I feel really bad for the Monster Energy guys. We had a win in our sights and I just drove the car at 101 percent instead of that 99 that I probably needed to be at." [...] Joey Logano assumed the race lead.|$|E
