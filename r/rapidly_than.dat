5|$|The {{start of}} the Industrial Revolution was marked by a massive boom in the textile industry, with {{remarkable}} technological innovations made, led by the cotton industry of Great Britain. In its early years, there were often disparities in technological innovation between different stages of fabric manufacture, which encouraged complementary innovations. For example, spinning progressed much more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> weaving.|$|E
5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, {{there is evidence that}} fish predators such as blueheads may adapt to visual cues more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that for an icy satellite the size of Mimas or Enceladus to enter an 'excited state' of tidal heating and convection, it would need to enter an orbital resonance before it lost too much of its primordial internal heat. Because Mimas, being smaller, would cool more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> Enceladus, its window of opportunity for initiating orbital resonance-driven convection would have been considerably shorter.|$|E
60|$|Of course I was {{described}} also as an Englishman. Miss Haldin spoke <b>rapidly,</b> faster <b>than</b> I {{have ever heard}} her speak, and that by contrast made the quietness of her eyes more expressive.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, Elizabethtown grew <b>rapidly,</b> more <b>than</b> {{doubling}} {{its population}} between 1950 and 2000. Homes and businesses expanded into nearby farmland, making sprawl, farmland preservation, and revitalizing {{the downtown area}} important issues.|$|R
30|$|Second, {{livestock}} {{appear to}} be increasing more <b>rapidly</b> outside <b>than</b> inside conservancies, and this is more visible for shoats than for cattle. However, it is as yet not possible to definitively ascribe this to conservancies.|$|R
5|$|Several {{million years}} ago, {{a species of}} small African ape gained the ability to stand upright. The {{subsequent}} advent of human life, {{and the development of}} agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300million years to culminate.|$|E
5|$|Despite segregationist {{and racist}} attitudes, St. Louis {{acted as a}} haven during the 1917 East St. Louis Riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to shelter and food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East St. Louis and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from the rural South to industrial cities, the black population of St. Louis increased more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the warbler eats insects {{as well as}} berries, and {{the fruits}} of the {{introduced}} Spanish flag is a favourite where present. An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> prior to their southward journey. Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they leave from savanna rather than the treeless Sahel further north.|$|E

5|$|Snow {{interacts with}} {{vegetation}} in two principal ways, vegetation {{can influence the}} deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth {{is dependent on the}} departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Sylvester's {{sequence}} {{is named after}} James Joseph Sylvester, who first investigated it in 1880. Its values grow doubly exponentially, and {{the sum of its}} reciprocals forms a series of unit fractions that converges to 1 more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> any other series of unit fractions with the same number of terms. The recurrence by which it is defined allows the numbers in the sequence to be factored more easily than other numbers of the same magnitude, but, due to the rapid growth of the sequence, complete prime factorizations are known only for a few of its members. Values derived from this sequence have also been used to construct finite Egyptian fraction representations of 1, Sasakian Einstein manifolds, and hard instances for online algorithms.|$|E
5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E
5000|$|A is the end-diastolic point; this is {{the point}} where {{contraction}} begins. Pressure starts to increase, becomes <b>rapidly</b> higher <b>than</b> the atrial pressure, and the mitral valve closes. Since pressure is also lower than the aortic pressure, the aortic valve is closed as well.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms {{are usually}} more severe and <b>rapidly</b> {{progressive}} <b>than</b> {{in the other}} more common Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases. Some patients may never walk and solely use wheelchairs {{by the end of}} their first decade, while others may need only a cane (walking stick) or similar support through life.|$|R
40|$|When human DNA(cytosine- 5) methyltransferase {{was used}} to methylate a series of snapback oligodeoxy-nucleotides of differing stem lengths, each {{containing}} a centrally located CG dinucleotide recognition site, the enzyme required a minimum of 22 base pairs in the stem for maximum activity. Extrahelical cytosines in slipped duplexes that were 30 base pairs in length acted as effective methyl acceptors and were more <b>rapidly</b> methylated <b>than</b> cytosines that were Watson-Crick paired. Duplexes containing hairpins of CCG repeats in cruciform structures in which the enzyme recognition sequence was disrupted by a C. C mispair were also more <b>rapidly</b> methylated <b>than</b> control Watson-Crick-paired duplexes. Since enzymes have higher affinities for their transition states than for their substrates, the results with extrahelical and mispaired cytosines suggest that these structures {{can be viewed as}} analogs of the transition state intermediates produced during catalysis by methyltransferases...|$|R
5|$|The 1870s {{were the}} golden years of Cope's career, marked by his most {{prominent}} discoveries and rapid flow of publications. Among his descriptions were the therapsid Lystrosaurus (1870), the archosauromorph Champsosaurus (1876), and the sauropod Amphicoelias (1878), possibly the largest dinosaur ever discovered. In {{the period of}} one year, from 1879 to 1880, Cope published 76papers based on his travels through New Mexico and Colorado, and {{on the findings of}} his collectors in Texas, Kansas, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah. During the peak years, Cope published around 25reports and preliminary observations each year. The hurried publications led to errors in interpretation and naming—many of his scientific names were later canceled or withdrawn. In comparison, Marsh wrote and published less frequently and more succinctly—his works appearance in the widespread American Journal of Science led to faster reception abroad, and subsequently Marsh's reputation grew more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> Cope's.|$|E
5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence more <b>rapidly</b> <b>than</b> do men. Additionally, {{women have a}} higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of strength of rock mass for wear of rippertip 	are expressed precisely as "Index of rock mass strength for wear". 	The wear amount and the wear length of pointed end of tip increase 	approximately with linear {{relationship to the}} ripping operation time, 	and each slope varies respectively according to the index of rock mass. 	For the rock mass which both index of rock mass strength for wear and 	abrasive strength of rock are small, the wear of side parts of tip progresses 	more <b>rapidly</b> rather <b>than</b> that of pointed end of tip. On the 	other hand, for the rock mass which both index of rock mass strength 	for wear and abrasive strength of rock are large, the wear of pointed 	end of tip progresses more <b>rapidly</b> rather <b>than</b> that of side parts of 	tip...|$|R

30|$|Low density wood is more <b>rapidly</b> eroded <b>than</b> denser wood {{when exposed}} to the weather, {{possibly}} {{because it is more}} susceptible to photodegradation. Fourier transform infrared microscopy was used to examine: (1) the depth of photodegradation in earlywood and latewood of sugi (Japanese cedar) and earlywood of hinoki (Japanese cypress) exposed for up to 1500 [*]h to artificial sunlight emitted by a xenon lamp (375 [*]W/m 2 within the 300 to 700 [*]nm spectral range); and (2) the relationship between the density of wood tissues and depth of photodegradation. The depth of photodegradation varied between species (sugi and hinoki) as well as within a growth ring (sugi earlywood and latewood), and there was an inversely proportional relationship between depth of photodegradation and wood density. These findings may explain why low density earlywood is more <b>rapidly</b> eroded <b>than</b> latewood during weathering, and more generally, why there is an inverse relationship between the density of wood species and their rate of erosion during artificial and natural weathering.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{compared}} {{the activity of}} daptomycin with that of ampicillin, penicillin, teicoplanin and vancomycin against 304 strains of Enterococcus species isolated from blood and urine. Daptomycin was as active as penicillin against Enterococcus faecalis: 90 % of strains were inhibited by 2 mg/L. Daptomycin was more active than vancomycin (90 % minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC 90] 2 mg/L; 90 % minimal bactericidal concentration [MBC 90] 8 mg/L) but was less active than teicoplanin (MIC 50 0. 25; MBC 90 8 mg/L) or ampicillin (MIC 90 1 mg/L; MBC 90 2 mg/L) against E faecalis. In time-kill studies daptomycin was not more <b>rapidly</b> bactericidal <b>than</b> ampicillin or penicillin but was significantly more <b>rapidly</b> bactericidal <b>than</b> either teicoplanin or vancomycin. In combination with gentamicin, daptomycin has activity {{similar to that of}} penicillin, vancomycin and teicoplanin. Daptomycin may be a suitable alternative to penicillin in patients allergic to penicillins or for the treatment of enterococcal infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing enterococci...|$|R
