25|$|HD Photo (previously {{known as}} Windows Media Photo) is a {{photographic}} still image file format, that is introduced with Windows Vista. It supports {{features such as}} high dynamic <b>range</b> <b>imaging,</b> lossy as well as lossless compression, up to 32-bpp fixed or floating point representation, transparency, RGB, CMYK and n-channel color spaces, Radiance RGBE, embedded ICC color profiles, multiple images per file and support for Exif and XMP metadata formats. It is the preferred image format for XPS documents.|$|E
25|$|For early fixed-function {{or limited}} {{programmability}} graphics (i.e., {{up to and}} including DirectX 8.1-compliant GPUs) this was sufficient because this is also the representation used in displays. This representation does have certain limitations, however. Given sufficient graphics processing power even graphics programmers would like to use better formats, such as floating point data formats, to obtain effects such as high dynamic <b>range</b> <b>imaging.</b> Many GPGPU applications require floating point accuracy, which came with video cards conforming to the DirectX 9 specification.|$|E

Earlier approaches lack robustness to imag-ing noise, do not provide accurate radius estimates for the structures and operate only on single channel images. In contrast, ours makes use of the color information, when available, and generates accurate and smooth paths with minimal supervision. We demonstrate the applicability and generality of our approach on a wide <b>range</b> of <b>imaging</b> modalities <b>ranging</b> from a 2 D dataset of aerial images to various 3 D datasets of micrographs. 1...|$|R
2500|$|New Horizons passed within [...] of Pluto, {{with this}} closest {{approach}} on July 14, 2015 at 11:50 UTC. New Horizons had a relative velocity of [...] at its closest approach, and came {{as close as}} [...] to Charon. Starting 3.2 days before the closest approach, long-range imaging included the mapping of Pluto and Charon to [...] resolution. This is half the rotation period of the Plutoâ€“Charon system and allowed imaging of all sides of both bodies. Close <b>range</b> <b>imaging</b> was repeated twice per day in order to search for surface changes caused by localized snow fall or surface cryovolcanism. Because of Pluto's tilt, {{a portion of the}} northern hemisphere would be in shadow at all times. During the flyby, engineers expected LORRI to be able to obtain select images with resolution as high as [...] if closest distance were around 12,500km, and MVIC was expected to obtain four-color global dayside maps at [...] resolution. LORRI and MVIC attempted to overlap their respective coverage areas to form stereo pairs. LEISA obtained hyperspectral near-infrared maps at [...] globally and [...] for selected areas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Conventional optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) systems {{generally have}} a limited <b>imaging</b> <b>range</b> within a depth of only 1 - 2 mm and suffers from unwanted noise such as speckle, ghost or mirror noise. To overcome these limitations, we developed a motorized-stage-based OCT system with an extended <b>imaging</b> <b>range,</b> using a common-path Fourier-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (CP-FD-OCT) configuration. Using this OCT systems, OCT image was obtained from an onion, and their subsurface structure were observed. The result showed that the OCT images obtained using our motorized-stage-based system had a significantly extended <b>imaging</b> <b>range</b> due to its real-time accurate depth tracking. Consequently, the devised CP-FD-OCT systems and algorithms have good potential for the further development of endoscopic OCT for microsurgery.

50|$|Laser <b>range</b> gated <b>imaging</b> {{is another}} form of active night vision which {{utilizes}} a high powered pulsed light source for illumination and <b>imaging.</b> <b>Range</b> gating is a technique which controls the laser pulses {{in conjunction with the}} shutter speed of the camera's detectors. Gated imaging technology can be divided into single shot, where the detector captures the image from a single light pulse, and multi-shot, where the detector integrates the light pulses from multiple shots to form an image. One of the key advantages of this technique is the ability to perform target recognition rather than mere detection, {{as is the case with}} thermal imaging.|$|R
