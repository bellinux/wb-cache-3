5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 {{science fiction}} novel by German author Alfred Döblin.

Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> being a difficult and polarizing novel, and has not received nearly {{as much attention as}} Döblin's following novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929).|$|E
