5000|$|The terms plug, pin, and prong {{are also}} {{often used for}} [...] "male" [...] connectors, and <b>receptacle,</b> <b>socket,</b> and slot are used for [...] "female" [...] connectors. In many cases these terms are more common than male and female, {{especially}} in documentation intended for the non-specialist. These nearly synonymous terms can cause {{a fair amount of}} confusion when the designations are shortened in labels.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{earthing}} {{systems are}} used {{to ensure that the}} ground and neutral wires have zero voltage with respect to earth, to prevent shocks when touching grounded electrical equipment. In some installations, there may be two line conductors which carry alternating currents in a single-phase three-wire. Small portable electrical equipment is connected to the power supply through flexible cables (these exist with either two or three insulated conductors) terminated in a plug, which is inserted into a fixed <b>receptacle</b> (<b>socket).</b> Larger household electrical equipment and industrial equipment may be permanently wired to the fixed wiring of the building. For example, in North American homes a window-mounted self-contained air conditioner unit would be connected to a wall plug, whereas the central air conditioning for a whole home would be permanently wired. Larger plug and socket combinations are used for industrial equipment carrying larger currents, higher voltages, or three phase electric power. These are often constructed with tougher plastics and possess inherent weather-resistant properties needed in some applications.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, many Commonwealth {{countries}} and some non-English-speaking countries, the word [...] "jack" [...] may {{refer to the}} plug {{on the end of a}} removable cable. These connectors were originally referred to as [...] "jack plugs", or plugs intended to be mated with fixed <b>receptacles,</b> or <b>sockets</b> (which North Americans would call [...] "jacks"), but the second word was dropped. This variant usage is in direct contradiction to common usage and official standards in North America.|$|R
50|$|Plug and socket {{connectors}} {{are usually}} {{made up of}} a male plug (typically pin contacts) and a female <b>receptacle</b> (typically <b>socket</b> contacts), although hermaphroditic connectors exist, such as the original IBM token ring LAN connector. Plugs generally have one or more pins or prongs that are inserted into openings in the mating socket. The connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit. When working with multi-pin connectors, it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin.|$|R
50|$|Leviton Manufacturing Company, Inc., is {{the largest}} privately held {{manufacturer}} of electrical wiring equipment in North America. It produces electrical light <b>sockets,</b> <b>receptacles</b> and outlets, switches, dimmers and other lighting control systems, wire, power cables, power cords, wall and ceiling occupancy sensors, wall plates, datacom, and other electrical products. Leviton is most famous for its Decora wall switch, the flat low profile form factor which replaced the standard toggle switch in many homes and office.|$|R
50|$|When {{there is}} only one socket in a house or apartment, the {{incoming}} line is connected to the two lower receptacles and the upper receptacles are left unused. When a subscriber has more than one telephone socket, they typically are connected so that two telephones can not be connected to the telephone exchange at the same time. This is done by connecting the two upper <b>receptacles</b> of a <b>socket</b> to the lower receptacles of the next socket. When a connected telephone's handset is lifted the two twisted pair connections are separated, thus disconnecting any telephones downward in the chain.|$|R
2500|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being power plug, [...] electric plug, and (in the UK) plug top. The normal technical term (in both British and International English) for an AC power socket is socket-outlet, but in non-technical contexts {{a number of other}} terms are in common use. In British English the general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including power point, plug socket, wall socket, and wall plug. In American English receptacle (which is a term not defined in IEC 60050) is used in official standards and codes such as the NEMA connector standard and the National Electrical Code. [...] The American National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) defines outlet as [...] "A point on the wiring system at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment." [...] In common use outlet is used to refer to the actual <b>receptacle</b> or <b>socket,</b> sometimes with qualifiers such as wall outlet, electrical outlet and electrical receptacle, all of these sometimes {{to be found in the}} same document. [...] There is also colloquial use of socket in American English.|$|R
