5000|$|Mobilisa test. When {{deciding}} this case, {{the court}} set forth a new three-part test by considering {{both of the}} Dendrite and Cahill tests: (1) the <b>requesting</b> <b>party</b> shows the anonymous speaker has been given adequate notice and a reasonable opportunity {{to respond to the}} discovery request; (2) the <b>requesting</b> <b>party</b> must demonstrate that it would survive a motion for summary judgment on the elements, not dependent on knowing the speaker's identity, and (3) the court need balance the strength of the requesting party's case against the need for disclosure of the anonymous poster's identity.|$|E

5000|$|A {{person-to-person call}} is an operator-assisted call {{in which the}} calling <b>party</b> <b>requests</b> {{to speak to a}} {{specific}} party and not simply to anyone who answers. The caller is not charged for the call unless the <b>requested</b> <b>party</b> can be reached. This method was popular when telephone calls were relatively expensive. The alternative, in which the calling party agrees to talk to whoever answers the telephone, is known as station-to-station. Since the introduction of direct dial telephone service and the subsequent drop in the price of long distance telephone calls, person-to-person service has virtually disappeared.|$|R
50|$|The Shah {{commission}} was later criticized for confusing investigation with inquiry.It had issued notices requesting {{testimony on oath}} without telling the <b>requested</b> <b>party</b> what case they were being asked to meet. It was on this grounds that Indira Gandhi and Pranab Mukherjee refused to depose on oath, {{and this was the}} reason why a complaint for contempt by the {{commission was}} rejected by a magistrate.|$|R

5000|$|In December 2005, the {{discovery}} order was vacated when The Suggestion Box objected by counsel. Charles Lee Mudd Jr. (Mudd Law Offices) and local counsel W.

50|$|The {{ex parte}} and {{restrictive}} {{nature of the}} saisie-contrefaçon, which makes it so efficient, can also {{be perceived as a}} possible source of abuse. It is possible that an economic operator might be tempted, under the pretext of the alleged infringement of its intellectual property right, to misuse the saisie-contrefaçon procedure in order to enter the premises of a competitor and try to obtain some of its industrial and trade secrets. However, first of all, in order to avoid such a risk, the judge has the option of preserving the confidentiality of the information gathered during the saisie-contrefaçon. Moreover, it is an established principle that the saisie-contrefaçon investigations are the responsibility of the <b>requesting</b> <b>party</b> and that the judge, when rendering the order for a saisie-contrefaçon, can order the <b>requesting</b> <b>party</b> to furnish security to compensate the seized party for any loss it may suffer, in case it later appears that the saisie-contrefaçon was abusive. Practitioners are aware of these rules which the courts apply with great care, and abuses are the exception.|$|E
