5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{construction}} of the castle walls, three round towers were built on the north, east, and west towers. The north tower, or donjon, is the largest, comprising three or four storeys originally, and probably housed the lord's private apartments. The west tower is almost internal, barely projecting beyond the <b>rounded</b> <b>corner</b> of the curtain wall, and could only be entered via the parapet walk. The basement level contains a pit prison which was accessed from above. The east tower was almost completely rebuilt in the late 15th century as a gatehouse. Each tower was probably once topped by a conical roof.|$|E

A block east of Castle Creek, it turns south on North Seventh Street; the intersection's southwest corner has been rounded {{to smooth the}} traffic flow, leaving a triangular traffic island {{in the middle of}} the road. Two blocks further south, at another intersection with a <b>rounded</b> <b>corner,</b> SH 82 turns east to follow West Main Street across Aspen.|$|E
500|$|The only {{specimen}} of Y. intermedius is [...] that has several cracks surrounding it, {{and areas of}} white [...] "mold" [...] coatings. The indent behind the propodeum (the first abdominal segment) is deep, {{the connection between the}} segment and the thorax is wide and covered in wrinkles of the exoskeleton. The propodeum has an angular appearance with a <b>rounded</b> <b>corner</b> when viewed from the side. [...] This separates the species from both Y. geinitzi and Y. mayrianum. [...] The legs of Y. intermedius are generally free of hairs while the mesosoma and head have only a few sparse hairs on the upper surface. [...] This is different then the much hairier Y. constrictus which always has numerous erect hairs on the body and legs. The high conical propodeum and scape which does not extend to the edge ofhte head capsule isolate Y. intermedius from Y. samlandicus. [...] The right antennae of the type specimen is preserved with the head of a Ctenobethylus goepperti worker ant clamped near the tip, and it seems the two had just fought prior to entombment.|$|E

500|$|The Monadnock {{belongs to}} the Printing House Row District, a National Historic Landmark which {{includes}} the Manhattan Building, the Old Colony Building, and the Fisher Building, some of Chicago's seminal early skyscrapers. The Manhattan Building, built by William LeBaron Jenney in 1890, was the first building in Chicago with a complete steel skeleton or [...] "Chicago" [...] construction, an innovation Jenney had introduced in the Home Insurance Building in 1884. The first 16-story building in America, {{at the time it}} was [...] "regarded with awe and fear". Jenney's masterpiece, the Manhattan was considered a technical triumph in construction. The 17-story Old Colony, built by Holabird & Roche in 1894, was considered one of the structural masterpieces of its time for its revolutionary portal form of bracing. It is the only survivor of a group of Chicago school buildings with <b>rounded</b> <b>corner</b> bays. The Fisher Building, built by Burnham in 1894, was an engineering miracle—the first tall commercial building to be built almost entirely without bricks. Its steel frame and thin terracotta curtain wall allowed two-thirds of the surface to be covered with glass.|$|E

2500|$|Tampa Stadium {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} expansion project in 1974–1975 {{after the city}} was awarded an NFL expansion team. Over 27,000 seats were added by completely enclosing the open end zones, making the venue {{one of the largest}} in the NFL with a capacity of 71,908. The resulting arena was not in the shape of a simple bowl. It was highest at the center of the two sideline grandstands and gently sloped downward to a <b>rounded</b> <b>corner</b> where it met the new sections, which were about half as tall. Much later, the stadium was dubbed [...] "The Big Sombrero" [...] by ESPN's Chris Berman for the unique undulating hat / wave shape created along the top of the stadium by the 1975 additions.|$|E

2500|$|Today, Stortorget is the {{location}} of the Stock Exchange Building (Börshuset), which houses the Swedish Academy, the Nobel Museum, and the Nobel Library. [...] Designed by Erik Palmstedt and built 1773–1776, it replaced the town hall that had occupied the lot for several hundreds years before and subsequently been relocated first to the Bonde Palace and then to the present Court House in 1915. [...] The plan of the building, French Rococo in style, is a trapezium, the <b>rounded</b> <b>corner</b> of which greatly widened the flanking alleys. [...] While the building is generally designed much like a private palace, the central pediment and the lantern-style cupola crowning the building underline its public status. [...] The closed first floor, accommodating the Swedish Academy, contrasts the openness of the ground floor - a contrast enhanced during the restoration in the 1980s.|$|E
