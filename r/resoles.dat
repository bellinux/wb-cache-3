The effects of phenol substitution ratio, weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of DKL and formaldehyde-to-phenol (F/P) ratio {{were also investigated}} to find the optimum curing temperature for BPF <b>resoles.</b> The results indicated that DKL with Mw ~ 1200 g/mol provides a curing temperature of less than 180 °C for any substitution level, provided that F/P ratios are controlled.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{co-curing}} blends of an unsaturated polyester (UP) with inherently fire-retardant and char-forming phenolic <b>resoles</b> (PH) on the thermal stability and fire retardancy {{of the resulting}} resins have been investigated. To overcome the challenge of UP/PH incompatibility, arising from their different chemical structures and curing mechanisms (radical vs. condensation), different phenolic <b>resoles</b> have been used: ethanol-soluble, epoxy-functionalized, and allyl-functionalized. A traditional water-based resole has also been used to give a reference non-compatible system. In Part 1 of this series of publications it was shown that the compatibility of the two resins increases with functionalization; the allyl-functionalized resole showing the best compatibility with UP. Limiting oxygen index measurements and cone calorimetry have shown that fire performance of the functionalized PH resins and their blends with UP is worse than that from the unfunctionalized PH resin, but still significantly better {{than that of the}} UP.

In this respect, phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins are ideal since they readily facilitate the incorporation of individual heteroatomic functions into a highly crosslinked matrix. A series of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing co-resites have been prepared using phenol with, as the second component, thiophene, dibenzothiophene, diphenylsulfide, benzyl phenyl sulfide, thioanisole, 8 -hydroxyquinoline and 2 -hydroxycarbazole. A mole ratio of 3 : 1 (phenol: heteroatom-containing component) was adopted {{in order to ensure}} that a reasonably high degree of crosslinking was achieved. <b>Resoles</b> containing diphenyldisulfide were also prepared but, due to the comparable bond strengths of the S-S and C-O linkages, a curing temperature of only 130 degrees C was used to avoid cleavage of the disulfide bond.

40|$|The {{flame retardance}} of co-cured blends of an {{unsaturated}} polyester with various phenolic <b>resoles</b> is improved {{by the addition}} of the phosphorus-containing flame retardants: resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate), bisphenol-A bis(diphenyl phosphate) and 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene- 10 -oxide.

However, although the improved flame retardancy is accompanied by increased char yields, smoke evolution is also increased indicating contributions from both condensed-phase and gas-phase mechanisms of flame retardance.

Compatibility of the vinyl esters with the Methylon resole is however better than with the Durez, which tends to give phase-separated blends, and thus blends having poor physical and mechanical properties.

40|$|Considering {{the declining}} non-renewable fossil resources, there is {{increasing}} interest {{in the development of}} more environmentally conscious, sustainable and cost-effective substitutes for chemical production. Lignin, a main component in lignocellulosic biomass, has been considered to be a potential substitute for petroleum-based phenol due to its phenolic structure. This PhD dissertation aimed at producing bio-based phenol formaldehyde (BPF) foams using bio-phenols, including but not limited to, kraft lignin (KL), organosolv lignin (OL), hydrolysis lignin (HL), and bio-crude oil from white birth bark. The challenge of the existing process of producing BPF foams is that a low phenol substitution ratio, generally less than 30 %, can be achieved due to much lower reactivity of bio-phenols compared with phenol. The use of conventional foaming technology was considered as the main reason for the low phenol substitution ratio in the production of BPF foams. Therefore, a novel foaming technology was developed for the production of BPF foams with high phenol substitution ratios of up to 50 %, taking into account both fundamental foaming principle and characteristics of BPF <b>resoles.</b> KL and OL were used as petroleum-based phenol substitutes without any pretreatments for BPF foam production. The optimal composition of the blowing agent was found to be (5 wt. % hexanes + 5 wt. % pentane) for the 50 % BPF foams, (7. 5 wt. % hexanes + 2. 5 wt. % pentane) for the 40 % BPF foams, 10 wt. % hexanes for the 30 % BPF foams. The results of cone calorimeter and limiting oxygen index (LOI) tests suggested that substituting phenol with lignin does not impact significantly on the combustion properties of the PF foams. Being even better, the introduction of KL in the PF foam could reduce the emission of toxic CO during the combustion. HL was de-polymerized by a proprietary low-temperature/no pressure de-polymerization process for the preparation of de-polymerized hydrolysis lignin (DHL) with Mn of 638 g/mol, Mw of 1910 g/mol, and PDI of 2. 99. Then the DHL was utilized as a phenol substitute for the synthesis of foamable BPF resole resins, followed by employing the above mentioned new modified foaming technology for BPF foam production. White birch bark was hydrothermally liquefied in ethanol-water (1 : 1, w/w) mixture into phenolic bio-crude oil, followed by production of foamable BPF <b>resoles</b> and then BPF foams. All BPF foams produced exhibited low apparent density, strong compressive strength, low thermal conductivity, and satisfactory closed cell structure, all of which were comparable to conventional PF foams. The new foaming technology demonstrated to be promising for industrial applications, which reduced the use of both petroleum-based phenol and toxic formaldehyde by up to 50 % in the preparation of BPF foams. The utilization of lignin for manufacturing of value-added bio-based materials could not only produce high-value bio-based PF foams as promising insulation and fire-retarding materials, but also greatly benefit the forestry and agriculture sectors with additional revenue streams...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{phenolic}} resin samples {{have been developed}} as the carbon precursor for SiC/C composites. Liquid {{phenolic resin}}s suitable for fiber-infiltration in the resin transfer moulding (RTM) process are synthesized by using versatile combination of the aromatic component (phenol, naphthalen- 2 -ol) with various formaldehyde equivalents such as methanal, 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetraazatricyclo[3. 3. 1. 13, 7]decane (urotropine), and 1, 3, 5 -trioxane, under different reaction conditions. Room temperature liquid <b>resoles</b> (RTLR) are obtained by using an excess of the formaldehyde component over phenol (≥ 2) under basic conditions. Upon heating RTLR can form a crosslinked network even without addition of a hardening reagent. In addition, novolacs are synthesized under acidic conditions using a phenol/formaldehyde ratio ≥ 1. Nitrogen-containing resins contain nitrogen due to reaction of phenol with urotropine. Novolacs and nitrogen-containing resins are solids at room temperature and not self-curing.

The flexural properties of these specimens were determined and the results were discussed taking into consideration the surface characteristics of the modified fibres, as derived from pull-out tests and contact angle measurements.
