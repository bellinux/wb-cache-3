500|$|The {{black bean}} aphid [...] can feed {{on a wide}} variety of host plants. Its primary hosts on which the eggs overwinter are shrubs such as the spindle tree (Euonymus europaeus), Viburnum species, or the mock-orange (Philadelphus species). Its {{secondary}} hosts, on which it spends the summer, include a number of crops including [...] sugar beets, spinach, beans, <b>runner</b> <b>beans,</b> celery, potatoes, sunflowers, carrots, artichokes, tobacco, and tomatoes. It colonises more than two hundred different species of cultivated and wild plants. Among the latter, it shows a preference for poppies (Papaver species), burdock (Arctium tomentonum), fat-hen (Chenopodium album), saltbush (Atriplex rosea), chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla), thistles (Cirsium arvense), and docks (Rumex spp.).|$|E

40|$|The scarlet <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> is a {{climbing}} perennial crop but it {{is often}} grown as an annual for dry seeds and immature green pods production {{in some parts of}} Europe. The <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars are appreciated for their large seeds and culinary quality together with high yield. As observed by the authors and local farmers, the <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> generally requires moderate temperatures for good germination and growth and the optimum temperature ranges from 20 ºC to 30 ºC. Thus, temperature is a limiting factor for <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> production and temperature under 10 ºC at sowing delays both germination and plant emergence, lengthening the crop cycle and increasing production costs. Therefore, an alternative to make maximum utilization of the available growing period is to use cultivars tolerant to sub-optimal temperature at the germination and emergence stages. The performance of cultivars under different growing conditions was evaluated in growing chamber at optimal (17 ºC-day/ 15 ºC-night) and sub-optimal (14 ºC-day/ 8 ºC-night) temperature on the basis of germination, earliness, ability to grow and vigor (Rodiño et al. 2007).

40|$|In {{the years}} 2002 - 2004 {{the biology of}} flowering, nectar {{secretion}} and foraging by insects of four <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars was investigated at the Apiculture Division, Institute of Pomology and Floriculture in Puawy. Under Poland’s condition <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> starts to bloom {{towards the end of}} June and the blooming continues for 33 to 42 days. The flowers of <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> develop exclusively in the morning, nearly 90 % of their daily instalment developing from 5 : 00 to 7 : 00, summer daylight-saving time (4 : 00 to 6 : 00 Central European time). Nectar starts to be secreted as soon as the bud stage. The buds to be developed into flowers in the morning to come, at mid-day contain already nearly 10 % and in the evening around 36 % of the total sugar amount. In the morning, freshly opened flowers contain nearly 70 % of the total sugar amount. In <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> flowers, resorption of sugars that have not been collected by insects starts in the evening but in picked flowers nectar persists on the following day, although in smaller quantity. <b>Runner</b> <b>bean</b> flowers secrete nectar copiously, at a rate of ca. 41 mg of sugars per 10 flowers concentrated at 35 to 45 %. <b>Runner</b> <b>bean</b> is visited mainly by the honeybee and by bumblebees for nectar. In the years of high short-tongued bumblebee populations their workers bite holes in many flowers and the honeybees will rather collect nectar through holes than the normal way.

40|$|Abstract. The {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in the years 2000 – 2002 at the Experimental Station of Czesławice near Nałczów on a field of monocultures of <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> and soybean. The subject of the studies was the rhizosphere soil of these plant species. The experiment of each plant included 2 combinations, i. e. with dressing the seeds with Zaprawa Oxafun T and without dressing the seeds (control). Results of the microbiological analysis of the rhizosphere soil of <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> and soybean showed that the plants grown of the seeds dressed with Zaprawa Oxafun T always gave {{a greater number of}} bacteria colonies, Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. but a smaller number of fungi colonies than in the control combination. In comparison to the rhizos-phere soil of soybean, the rhizosphere soil of <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> contained much more bacteria and a much lower number of fungi colonies. Among the obtained saprotrophic macroorganisms, a more numerous group of antagonis-tic bacteria and fungi was achieved from the rhizosphere soil of <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> than from the rhizosphere soil of soybean. Whatever the plant species, considerably more antagonistic bacteria and fungi occurred in the combination with Zaprawa Oxafun T as compared to the control. The plant species as well as the introduction of Zaprawa Oxafun T into the soil together with the seeds had a considerable influence on the quantitative and qualitative composi-tion of the populations of soil microorganisms.

40|$|Relatively {{few studies}} have {{extensively}} analysed the genetic diversity of the <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> through molecular markers. Here, we used six chloroplast microsatellites (cpSSRs) to investigate the cytoplasmic diversity of 331 European domesticated accessions of the scarlet <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus coccineus L.), including the botanical varieties albiflorus, bicolor and coccineus, and a sample of 49 domesticated and wild accessions from Mesoamerica. We further explored the pattern of diversity of the European landraces using 12 phenotypic traits on 262 individuals. For 158 European accessions, we studied the relationships between cpSSR polymorphisms and phenotypic traits. Additionally, to gain insights {{into the role of}} gene flow and migration, for a subset of 115 accessions, we compared and contrasted the results obtained by cpSSRs and phenotypic traits with those obtained in a previous study with 12 nuclear microsatellites (nuSSRs). Our results suggest that both demographic and selective factors have roles in the shaping of the population genetic structure of the European <b>runner</b> <b>bean.</b> In particular, we infer the existence of a moderate-to-strong cytoplasmic bottleneck that followed the expansion of the crop into Europe, and we deduce multiple domestication events for this species.

5000|$|The three {{commonly}} known types of green beans are: string or snap beans, {{which may be}} round or have a flat pod; stringless or French beans, which lack a tough, fibrous [...] "string" [...] running {{along the length of}} the pod; and <b>runner</b> <b>beans,</b> which belong to a separate species, Phaseolus coccineus. Green beans may have a purple rather than green pod, which changes to green when cooked. Wax beans are P. vulgaris beans that have a yellow or white pod.
