5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the <b>relief</b> <b>sought</b> and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} for bringing applications for prerogative orders is {{set out in}} Order53 of the Rules of Court ("O. 53"). It is a two-stage process. At the first stage, the applicant must request the High Court for leave to apply for one or more prerogative orders. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the <b>relief</b> <b>sought</b> and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit verifying the facts relied on.|$|E
25|$|NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co. 304 U.S. 333 (1938) is a 7-0 {{decision}} by the United States Supreme Court which held that workers who strike remain employees {{for the purposes of}} the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The Court granted the <b>relief</b> <b>sought</b> by the National Labor Relations Board, which sought to have the workers reinstated by the employer. However, the decision is much better known today for its obiter dicta in which the Court said that an employer may hire strikebreakers and is not bound to discharge any of them if or when the strike ends.|$|E

500|$|At common law, {{there is}} no general right to claim damages – that is, {{monetary}} compensation – if rules of public law have been breached by a public authority. In order to obtain damages, an aggrieved person {{must be able to}} establish a private law claim in contract or tort law. While such a person would previously have had to take out a legal action for damages separately from any judicial review proceedings, since May 2011 it has been possible for a person who has successfully obtained prerogative orders or a declaration to ask the High Court to also award him or her [...] "relevant relief", that is, a liquidated sum, damages, equitable relief or restitution. The Court may give directions to the parties relating to the conduct of the proceedings or otherwise to determine whether the applicant is entitled to the relevant <b>relief</b> <b>sought,</b> and must allow any party opposing the granting of such relief an opportunity to be heard.|$|E
2500|$|Per , the U.S. District Court may [...] "extend {{a term of}} {{supervised}} release if {{less than}} [...] the maximum authorized term was previously imposed, and may modify, [...] reduce, or enlarge the conditions of supervised release". Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(c) provides that the court must hold a hearing unless the defendant has waived the hearing, or the <b>relief</b> <b>sought</b> is favorable to the defendant and does not extend the term of probation or of supervised release, and {{an attorney for the}} government has received notice of the <b>relief</b> <b>sought,</b> has had a reasonable opportunity to object, and has not done so.|$|E
2500|$|In {{civil law}} cases, the [...] "burden of proof" [...] {{requires}} the plaintiff {{to convince the}} trier of fact (whether judge or jury) of the plaintiff's entitlement to the <b>relief</b> <b>sought.</b> [...] This means that the plaintiff must prove each element of the claim, or cause of action, in order to recover. However, in cases of proving loss of future earning capacity, the plaintiff must prove {{there is a real}} or substantial possibility of such a loss occurring.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Stevens concurred separately, {{on similar}} grounds as Justice Brennan did. [...] He {{felt that the}} Court’s attempt to find an 18th-century common law {{analogue}} to the collective-bargaining and fair representation actions {{in this case was}} a misguided historical judgment, and that the type of <b>relief</b> <b>sought</b> by the plaintiff was the relevant inquiry. [...] He explained that it was perfectly rational to have members of the community—i.e. a jury of one’s peers—hear such a case.|$|E
2500|$|The Court then {{considered}} {{a line of}} English cases where the application was dismissed {{for a lack of}} standing. In R. v. Legal Aid Board, ex parte Hardiman, an application was dismissed after leave was granted due to a change of factual circumstances. The Court held that the principal <b>relief</b> <b>sought</b> would have been [...] "entirely a purposeless exercise" [...] for the applicant. Furthermore, in R. v. Head Teacher of Fairfield Primary School, ex parte W, the action was denied as there would be [...] "no practical benefit" [...] to the applicant.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Kennedy, {{with whom}} Justices O'Connor and Scalia joined, dissented, {{arguing that the}} majority’s analogy to an {{equitable}} trust action should have been dispositive in this case. [...] He further argued {{that the relationship between}} the union and its workers was more similar to the relationship between a trustee and a beneficiary than an attorney and his client, because a union had a duty of fair representation to all of its workers and did not normally be compelled to act as an agent by one beneficiary. [...] He also stated that the <b>relief</b> <b>sought</b> by the plaintiffs was equitable in nature, because it sought to make the plaintiffs whole, and that the majority unnecessarily separated out the legal and equitable issues in this case.|$|E

2500|$|On 4 October, the {{government}} filed {{an application for}} a stay of execution of Lam's earlier judgment. David Pannick, again representing the Commissioner, had argued that the [...] "status quo should be maintained" [...] until appeals had been exhausted. However, on 26 October, Johnson Lam ruled against {{the government}}'s application for stay. He noted that his earlier ruling applied only {{to the case of}} Vallejos herself. He stated that other FDHs would be free to file applications. However, he stated that it would be entirely permissible for the Immigration Department to delay processing of such applications until after appeals, and that such action would not constitute contempt of court as the government had feared. He further stated that if the Immigration Department chose not to entertain other applications by FDHs, it was up to those applicants themselves to take their cases to court. He also pointed out that [...] "hort of a temporary validity order, the court cannot pre-empt any person from relying on the legal principles set out in a judgment of the court"; the government did not seek such an order, and Lam doubted that the court had jurisdiction to give it. Thus, as he stated, the <b>relief</b> <b>sought</b> by the government would not shield it from suits by other right of abode applicants. Vallejos' solicitor Mark Daly stated that his client's residence application was [...] "100 percent sure" [...] as a result. The Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor was quoted as welcoming the ruling.|$|E
2500|$|The constitutions of some jurisdictions have clauses {{stating that}} the court may provide redress to those whose rights {{have been shown to}} be violated. The Privy Council has held that such clauses empower the court to grant damages (monetary compensation) vindicating the {{constitutional}} right that has been contravened to [...] "reflect the sense of public outrage, emphasise the importance of the constitutional right and the gravity of the breach, and deter further breaches". However, no clause of this nature exists in the Singapore Constitution. Since in Singapore the granting of damages is outside the ambit of judicial review in administrative law, the same is probably true for a breach of the Constitution. In order to claim damages, an aggrieved person must be able to establish a private law claim in contract or tort law. Prior to May 2011, if prerogative orders had been applied for under O.53 of the Rules of Court, such a person would have had to take out a separate legal action for damages. Now, it is possible for a person who has successfully obtained prerogative orders or a declaration to ask the High Court to also award him or her [...] "relevant relief", that is, a liquidated sum, damages, equitable relief or restitution. The Court may give directions to the parties relating to the conduct of the proceedings or otherwise to determine whether the applicant is entitled to the relevant <b>relief</b> <b>sought,</b> and must allow any party opposing the granting of such relief an opportunity to be heard.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{decision}} denied the <b>relief</b> <b>sought</b> by the plaintiffs for pragmatic reasons—the dam was already standing—but {{the decision was}} nonetheless heralded as a landmark victory for the Ainu people. In short, {{nearly all of the}} plaintiffs' claims were recognized. Moreover, the decision marked the first time Japanese case law acknowledged the Ainu as an indigenous people and contemplated the responsibility of the Japanese nation to the indigenous people within its borders. The decision included broad fact-finding that underscored the long history of the oppression of the Ainu people by Japan's majority, referred to as Wajin in the case and discussions about the case. The legal roots of the decision can be found in Article 13 of Japan's Constitution, which protects the rights of the individual, and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The decision was issued on March 27, 1997, and because of the broad implications for Ainu rights, the plaintiffs decided not to appeal the decision, which became final two weeks later. After the decision was issued, on May 8, 1997, the Diet passed the Ainu Culture Law and repealed the Ainu Protection Act—the 1899 law that had been the vehicle of Ainu oppression for almost one hundred years.The law's original Japanese text is available at [...] While the Ainu Culture Law has been widely criticized for its shortcomings, the shift that it represents in Japan's view of the Ainu people {{is a testament to the}} importance of the Nibutani decision. In 2007 the 'Cultural Landscape along the Sarugawa River resulting from Ainu Tradition and Modern Settlement' was designated an Important Cultural Landscape. A later action seeking restoration of Ainu assets held in trust by the Japanese Government was dismissed in 2008.|$|E
