2500|$|The Game Boy Advance {{version was}} {{generally}} considered the weakest {{version of the}} game. IGN's Marc Nix scored it 6 out of 10, and was especially critical of the combat; [...] "enemies get the jump on you with the first attack, and since there can be several enemies on screen, it can {{take a long time}} for your turn to come up. Then you have to watch every swipe of battle, which all begin and end with the characters taking a LONG walk across the screen to attack and then retreat - just the time that it takes for sprites to rotate back into the <b>ready</b> <b>position</b> is enough time for you to lose interest." [...] He called the game [...] "a rough start for the journey." [...] GameSpy's Avi Fryman scored it 1.5 out of 5, criticizing the graphics, and finding the game buggy, writing [...] "I wonder if it was even tested prior to its clearly rushed release." [...] GameSpot's Frank Provo scored it 2.1 out of 10, writing, [...] "the range of interactivity is so low and the action is so infrequent that Frodo's quest to Mount Doom is reduced to nothing more than a trivial errand. What's more, the entire game is so unpolished and full of bugs that it's unfathomable how it ever passed quality assurance in the first place." ...|$|E

50|$|In Anarchy Rulz, {{there are}} very many unique moves added to the game, with none being removed. Some moves are in twice under {{different}} names (in the same fighting position).

5000|$|The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center {{described}} Ready as a neo-Nazi. Several Republicans {{attempted to}} have him expelled from his position in the party in Maricopa County due to his controversial views. Before starting a campaign for the position of Pinal County sheriff, he left the National Socialist Movement, but had Movement member Harry Hughes serving as his campaign chairman. He ran for sheriff as a Democrat, citing the party's past support for Jim Crow and Democratic politicians who had supported racial segregation, such as Robert Byrd and George Wallace, as well as stating his opinion {{that there was no}} difference between the Republican and Democratic parties, and that in a non-partisan position such as sheriff, political affiliation did not matter. After Ready's death, former Arizona State Senator Russell Pearce released a statement saying that he had previously rejected Ready due to his association with [...] "despicable groups in society", and had objected to <b>Ready's</b> <b>position</b> in the Republican Party.|$|R

50|$|Kapitänleutnant Amberger {{ordered the}} ballast tanks blown and the {{submarine}} went up. Charges also knocked out the main generator aboard the Fanning. If U-58 had surfaced {{in a battle}} <b>ready</b> <b>position,</b> Fanning would have surely been attacked and possibly sunk. The German submariners surrendered and Fanning maneuvered to take prisoners. That ended the action with an American victory.|$|E
50|$|The {{term has}} {{fallen out of}} usage in the modern game, but the {{technique}} is still used. The stutter step is basically running forward with small steps while squatting, having the back perpendicular to the ground, and having the racquet up in front. It is a technique used to approach the net after a strong approach shot {{in preparation for a}} volley. It allows the player to be in a stable <b>ready</b> <b>position</b> while moving forward and creating a higher percentage volley.|$|E
50|$|Sa-yu men (左右面) strikes - or hidari (left, 左) and migi (right, 右) men, {{respectively}} - are variants {{on the men}} {{strike and}} are made at points either fifteen degrees {{to the left or}} right of centreline as drawn from the point between the eyes {{to the top of the}} head. This strike is made only with a subtle variation on the basic men technique. The tip is simply directed slightly more left or right as it is cocked back into the <b>ready</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

Modified AMX-13 light tank chassis (two eight-round container-launcher installations - unknown export customer).|$|R
50|$|If only {{a single}} crash is to be played, the {{sounding}} cymbals are then both raised in a follow through and held vertical but no longer parallel, but instead in roughly the same plane with their concave surfaces facing the audience and held head high {{on either side of}} the player. This allows the cymbals to resonate freely. Alternatively, if another stroke is to follow, the cymbals are allowed to follow through only until they have reached the same heights as they started (but now vertically reversed), and are then <b>ready</b> in <b>position</b> for the next stroke.|$|R
50|$|The {{permanent}} {{magnetic field}} holds the hammer spring in stressed, <b>ready</b> to strike <b>position.</b> The driver sends electric current to hammer coil, which then creates electromagnetic field opposite to the permanent magnetic field. When both fields equalize, the energy {{stored in the}} spring is released to strike the hammer against the ribbon and prints a dot on the paper.|$|R
