40|$|Background. Postcolonoscopy {{abdominal}} discomfort and bloating are common. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate whether rectal decompression improved distension-induced abdominal symptoms and influenced anorectal physiology. Methods. In 15 healthy subjects, rectal distension was achieved by direct air inflation into the rectum by colonoscopy. Placement of <b>rectal</b> and sham <b>tube</b> was then performed in each subject on a separate occasion. The anorectal parameters and distension-induced abdominal symptoms were recorded. Results. Anorectal parameters were similar between placements of <b>rectal</b> <b>tube</b> and sham tube except for greater <b>rectal</b> compliance <b>with</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>tube</b> than <b>with</b> sham <b>tube</b> (P< 0. 05). Abdominal pain and bloating were significantly reduced by <b>rectal</b> <b>tube</b> and sham tube at 1 minute (both P< 0. 05) and 3 minutes (both P< 0. 05). After placement of <b>rectal</b> <b>tube,</b> abdominal pain at 3 minutes correlated positively with first sensation (r= 0. 53, P= 0. 04), and bloating at 3 minutes also correlated positively with urge sensation (r= 0. 55, P= 0. 03).

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the unlicensed {{use of a}} Foley catheter in home enteral tube feeding in the community.

40|$|Pollen tube {{elongation}} is a rapid tip growth {{process that}} is driven by a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. A ubiquitous family of actin binding proteins, actin-depolymerizing factors (ADFs) /cofilins, bind to actin filaments, induce severing, enhance depolymerization from their slow-growing end, and are important for maintaining actin dynamics in vivo. ADFs/cofilins are regulated by multiple mechanisms, among which Rho small GTPase-activated phosphorylation at a terminal region Ser residue {{plays an important role}} in regulating their actin binding and depolymerizing activity, affecting actin reorganization. We have shown previously that a tobacco pollen-specific ADF, NtADF 1, is important for maintaining normal pollen tube actin cytoskeleton organization and growth. Here, we show that tobacco pollen grains accumulate phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of ADFs, suggesting that phosphorylation could be a regulatory mechanism for their activity. In plants, Rho-related Rac/Rop GTPases have been shown to be important regulators for pollen tube growth. Overexpression of Rac/Rop GTPases converts polar growth into isotropic growth, resulting in pollen <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> <b>ballooned</b> tips and a disrupted actin cytoskeleton. Using the Rac/Rop GTPase-induced defective pollen tube phenotype as a functional assay, we show that overexpression of NtADF 1 suppresses the ability of NtRac 1, a tobacco Rac/Rop GTPase, to convert pollen tube tip growth to isotropic growth. This finding suggests that NtADF 1 acts in a common pathway with NtRac 1 to regulate pollen tube growth. A mutant form of NtADF 1 with a nonphosphorylatable Ala substitution at its Ser- 6 position [NtADF 1 (S 6 A) ] shows increased activity, whereas the mutant NtADF 1 (S 6 D), which has a phospho-mimicking Asp substitution at the same position, shows reduced ability to counteract the effect of NtRac 1. These observations suggest that phosphorylation at Ser- 6 of NtADF 1 could be important for its integration into the NtRac 1 signaling pathway. Moreover, overexpression of NtRac 1 diminishes the actin binding activity of green fluorescent protein (GFP) -NtADF 1 but has little effect on the association of GFP-NtADF 1 (S 6 A) with actin cables in pollen tubes. Together, these observations suggest that NtRac 1 -activated activity regulates the actin binding and depolymerizing activity of NtADF 1, probably via phosphorylation at Ser- 6. This notion is further supported by the observation that overexpressing a constitutively active NtRac 1 in transformed pollen grains significantly increases the ratio of phosphorylated to nonphosphorylated ADFs. Together, the observations reported here strongly support the idea that NtRac 1 modulates NtADF 1 activity through phosphorylation at Ser- 6 to regulate actin dynamics...|$|R

Both cuffs are inflated through a single small lumen line and pilot balloon. The cuffs are high-volume, low-pressure cuffs with inflating volume ranging from 10 ml (size 0) to 90 ml (size 5). A large bore syringe, which is marked with the required volume for each size, is used to inflate the cuffs.

40|$|In 10 healthy {{subjects}} and 10 duodenal ulcer patients the intestinal phase of gastric acid secretion was studied by intraduodenal infusion of a 10 % liver extract meal (pH 7) at 400 ml/h for three hours. A gastroduodenal double lumen <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> two <b>balloons</b> {{was used to}} block the pylorus and to prevent duodenogastric reflux. Gastric acid response to a duodenal meal of liver extract reached a peak {{at the end of}} the first hour of infusion of the extract and was then followed by a relatively well-sustained plateau. When the figure was normalised as a percentage of peak response to pentagastrin it was about 45 % in healthy {{subjects and}} 63 % in duodenal ulcer patients. Serum gastrin concentration increased significantly during a duodenal meal of liver extract only in duodenal ulcer patients and not in healthy subjects. The combination of the duodenal meal of liver extract with pentagastrin infusion resulted in a significantly greater increase in acid output in duodenal ulcer patients than in healthy controls. Duodenal perfusion with a liver extract meal in which the pH was gradually decreased caused a pH-dependent reduction in acid output, but not in serum gastrin, both in the duodenal ulcer patients and in healthy subjects. This study shows that the intestinal phase in man results in a potent gastric acid stimulation which is pH-dependent, greatly augmented by pentagastrin, and more vigorous in duodenal ulcer patients than in healthy controls...|$|R

The method is hierarchical, detecting parts of the tube in increasing order of complexity, from tube cross sections and tube segments to the whole flexible tube. To increase the speed of the algorithm, candidate parts are generated using a voting strategy. The detected tube segments are combined into a flexible tube using a dynamic programming algorithm. Testing the algorithm on 210 unseen datasets resulted in a tube detection rate of 94. 7 % and 0. 12 false alarms per volume. The method can be easily retrained to detect and segment other tubular 3 D structures. ...|$|R

We evaluated the effect of antral distension on pancreatic, biliary, and gastric secretions and on the release of cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin, and pancreatic polypeptide in five healthy volunteers. Studies were performed using a duodenal <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> an inflatable <b>balloon</b> in the antrum and a separate gastric tube. Outputs were compared with responses to a maximal CCK stimulus (caerulein), and the role of cholinergic mechanisms was investigated using atropine. Graded antral distension by 50 -, 200 -, and 350 -ml balloon volumes and constant antral distension by 350 ml elicited a marked stimulation of pancreaticobiliary secretions. Mean lipase outputs amounted to 52 - 60 %, and mean bilirubin outputs reached 14 - 22 % of maximal. Atropine completely abolished pancreaticobiliary responses to antral distension. Antral distension did not affect bicarbonate and gastric secretions. Plasma pancreatic polypeptide levels increased markedly during antral distension, and this effect was completely suppressed by atropine. There were no changes in circulating gastrin and CCK. These data demonstrate that antral distension with already small volumes of 50 ml elicits a hitherto unknown potent stimulatory effect, indicating a major role of the antrum in the postprandial pancreaticobiliary response in humans, which is mediated by cholinergic mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|A stent is {{a device}} {{that is used to}} support {{arterial}} walls to alleviate the blockage of arteries by plaque. The slotted tube stent {{is one of the most}} common stent designs being widely used in many patients today. The amount of stent implantations is growing each year and for this it is becoming increasingly important in interventional cardiology. One of the reasons is that the use of stents has proved more effective in the therapy of coronary stenosis. However, it is evidenced that the success of the stent implantation is limited by re-stenosis, which is discussed almost entirely in terms of medical and biological reasons. This work is concerned with investigating the deformation mechanism with variable conditions during slotted tube expansion processes using numerical simulation. The simulations were run and analysed using commercial finite element software. A nonlinear explicit solution method was used in each case. The processes chosen for simulation were: slotted tube expansion without balloon catheter, slotted <b>tube</b> expansion <b>with</b> <b>balloon</b> catheter, scaling the stent size, stent production defect and slotted <b>tube</b> expansion <b>with</b> the presence of artery and plaque. A number of process parameters were varied for balloon catheter (i. e. balloon length, thickness and friction factor) and the subsequent effects on the process were identified. Some trial experimental tests were carried out to verify the finite element results from the computer simulations. From the results obtained it was concluded that higher rate of pressure increase results in higher stresses in stent for similar levels of expansion. Deployment of higher magnitude pressure might increase the expansion in radial direction but it does not necessarily increase the uniformity of the slotted tube. Appropriate balloon length has to be chosen to obtain a uniform expansion. Friction could reduce the foreshortening of the stent. When scaling down the stent, displacement deceases proportionally for similar deployment pressure and stent geometry. It was found from the simulations that the tubular stent is not very sensitive to imperfections. Altering sent strut configuration and number has practical effects on the clinical use of vascular stents, as the magnitude of expansion will change. The deformation characteristic of the slotted tube during deployment is affected by the presence of artery and plaque...|$|R
