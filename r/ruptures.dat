5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that <b>ruptures</b> the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
5|$|During several {{independent}} {{field studies}} cracks and other ground deformations were observed {{on both the}} Egyptian and Saudi Arabian sides of the gulf. During a field survey that was done there in 1996, a series of cracks were discovered between 28°35' N and 29°05' N on the Saudi Arabian coast. A field investigation was also done in Egypt in 1996 by seismologist Yann Klinger and others along with the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority. The most dramatic ground <b>ruptures</b> found were north of Nuweiba along a coastal road.|$|E

40|$|Objectives Abdominal aortic {{aneurysm}} (AAA) <b>rupture</b> has a highmortality rate. Although {{the diagnosis of}} a <b>ruptured</b> AAA is usually straightforward, detection of impending <b>rupture</b> signs can be more challenging. Early diagnosis of impending AAA <b>rupture</b> can be lifesaving. Furthermore, differentiating between impending and complete <b>rupture</b> has important re-percussions on patient management and prognosis. The pur-pose {{of this article is}} to classify and illustrate the entire spectrum of AAA <b>rupture</b> signs and to review current treat-ment options for <b>ruptured</b> AAAs. Methods Using medical illustrations supplemented with com-puted tomography (CT), this essay showcases the various signs of impending <b>rupture</b> and <b>ruptured</b> AAAs. Endovascular aneu-rysm repair (EVAR) and open surgical repair are also discussed as treatment options for <b>ruptured</b> AAAs. Results CT imaging findings of <b>ruptured</b> AAAs can be categorised according to location: intramural, luminal, and extraluminal. Intramural signs generally indicate impending AAA <b>rupture,</b> whereas luminal and extraluminal signs imply complete <b>rupture.</b> EVAR has emerged as an alternative and possibly less morbid meth-od to treat <b>ruptured</b> AAAs.

Most were killed by {{injuries}} sustained in the multiple impacts, but 35 {{people in the middle}} fuselage section directly above the fuel tanks died from smoke inhalation in the post-crash fire.

5|$|Some {{national}} standards {{require that the}} cylinder valve includes a bursting disk, a pressure relief device that will release the gas before the cylinder fails {{in the event of}} overpressurization. If a bursting disk <b>ruptures</b> during a dive the entire contents of the cylinder will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, in good condition, on a correctly filled cylinder is very low.|$|E
5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or <b>ruptures</b> into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{assumption}} of multiple time windows with a large initial <b>rupture</b> velocity, we inverted hr-GPS data for a <b>rupture</b> model with varying <b>rupture</b> velocity for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. By comparison of a slip model and <b>rupture</b> velocity distribution, the large slip areas were coupled with areas of large <b>rupture</b> expansion speed. Similar to the result from seismic waveforms, which are not limited by temporal resolution, the temporal <b>rupture</b> process and the total moment rate function showed three energy release stages during the event. The slip propagated from the hypocenter to the shallow part during the first energy release stage. In the second stage, the <b>rupture</b> in Region I that experienced a repeating slip released an extremely large amount of energy. The shallow part <b>ruptured</b> through the overall <b>rupture</b> duration time, forming a large <b>rupture</b> asperity with a maximum slip of about 65  m. The patterns of slip, stress drop, and <b>rupture</b> velocity demonstrate that high-frequency seismic waves radiated from both shallow and deep depths, whereas low-frequency waves radiated from the shallow fault. Therefore, varying the <b>rupture</b> velocity allowed us to obtain a more appropriate <b>rupture</b> model than that when using an assumed constant <b>rupture</b> velocity. Higher temporal resolution is preferred to determine the kinematic <b>rupture</b> process in detail by using hr-GPS data.|$|R

Although Picard offers himself in Data's place, the android refuses to leave.

5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or <b>ruptures</b> into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of <b>ruptures,</b> lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect the airway or it may go only partway around. Partial tears that do not go {{all the way around the}} circumference of the airway do not allow a lacerated airway to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in the airway, preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E
30|$|The extra fault {{parameters}} are the <b>rupture</b> starting point, pattern of propagation of the <b>rupture,</b> and <b>rupture</b> velocity.

30|$|From {{the point}} of view of <b>rupture</b> propagation, the {{complexities}} in <b>rupture</b> velocity and the directivity are remarkable. The <b>rupture</b> around the hypocenter in the early stage was especially complicated, while the southward propagation of the <b>rupture</b> in the later stage was relatively fast and smooth. The average propagation velocity of the <b>rupture</b> estimated from the <b>rupture</b> time (i.e., the time that energy was mostly released) at each subfault is considerably small.|$|R
50|$|This {{event was}} the last of three {{earthquakes}} that <b>ruptured</b> adjacent parts of the plate interface, forming a northeastward migrating sequence.

5|$|The {{length of}} the {{gestation}} period tends to vary greatly, though 110 days is {{the average length of}} time. In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels the result of high concentrations of ovarian androstenedione are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology. This has the effect of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers' weight. During parturition, the clitoris <b>ruptures</b> in order to facilitate the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|Volvariella bombycina, {{commonly}} known as the silky sheath, silky rosegill, silver-silk straw mushroom, or tree mushroom, is a species of edible mushroom in the family Pluteaceae. It is an uncommon but widespread species, having been reported from Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America. The fruit body (mushroom) begins developing in a thin, egg-like sac. This <b>ruptures</b> and the stem expands quickly, leaving the sac {{at the base of the}} stem as a volva. The cap, which can attain a diameter of up to , is white to slightly yellowish and covered with silky hairs. On the underside of the cap are closely spaced gills, free from attachment to the stem, and initially white before turning pink as the spores mature. The mushroom grows singly or in clusters, often appearing in old knotholes and wounds in elms and maples. V.bombycina contains compounds with antibacterial properties.|$|E
5|$|Jason X (2001) {{takes place}} in the future, when Jason has again been inexplicably resurrected. A scientist, Rowan Lafontaine (Lexa Doig), decides that cryonic {{suspension}} is the only method of stopping him, but Jason breaks free and kills the army personnel guarding him before he can be again imprisoned. Rowan manages to lure Jason into the cryo‑chamber, but he <b>ruptures</b> the tank and freezes both himself and Rowan. Over 400 years later, a team of students studying Earth discover Jason's body and take it into space. Upon being thawed by the team, he proceeds to murder everyone aboard the spacecraft. He is seemingly killed, but is then resurrected via nanotechnology as a cyborg version of himself. Finally, he is ejected into space and incinerated by Earth Two's atmosphere, his mask falling to the bottom of a lake. The next Friday the 13th film, Freddy vs. Jason (2003), was a crossover with A Nightmare on Elm Street. Set in the contemporary period, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) and sends him to Springwood hoping that he will create enough fear among the residents that Freddy will be strong enough to invade their dreams. Jason accomplishes this but refuses to stop killing. A battle ensues both in the dream-world and at Crystal Lake. The outcome is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy's severed head, which winks and laughs.|$|E

40|$|Bond <b>rupture</b> is an {{experimental}} methodology {{that is used}} to augment a conventional mass balance biosensor. A good point-of-care biosensor is fast, reliable, simple, cost-effective, and detects low concentrations of the target analyte. Biosensor development is a multidisciplinary field and bond <b>rupture</b> testing is of technical interest to many groups. The Bond <b>rupture</b> methodology endows a mass probe with the ability to discern bond strength. The recognition of specific bonds by mass loading is separated from erroneous non-specific binding by a probe of the force between the analyte and the transducer. Bond <b>rupture</b> is achieved by acoustic excitation of the point of attachment. The force is incremented gradually until <b>rupture</b> occurs. The advancement of bond <b>rupture</b> biosensors beyond the lab requires improved understanding of the mechanisms of bond <b>rupture</b> by base excitation, the transducers, and the supporting hardware. Bond <b>rupture</b> has traditionally been used in conjunction with the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). There exists, however, a variety of sensors and transducers to which the bond <b>rupture</b> methodology could be applied. The time, cost and experience required for comprehensive investigation of all avenues is prohibitive. To further the development of bond <b>rupture</b> characteristic experiments are designed and carried out on the QCM platform. Numerical simulations are constructed which model the current bond <b>rupture</b> approach. This work is limited to the simulation of bond <b>rupture</b> by base excitation. From the results of the experimental investigation a number of improvements to the bond <b>rupture</b> technique are proposed. Improvements are tested by simulation and the Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) device is selected to advance the bond <b>rupture</b> craft. A prototype SAW bond <b>rupture</b> device is designed. The prototype device is manufactured and tested, confirming the principle of SAW bond <b>rupture.</b> Future work is required to progress the SAW bond <b>rupture</b> methodology before possible integration with other sensor systems. Because of this work, and the evaluation of the SAW bond <b>rupture</b> prototype, much is learned about the advancement of SAW device bond <b>rupture...</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{have studied}} {{differences}} in ground motion and fault <b>rupture</b> characteristics between surface <b>rupture</b> and buried <b>rupture</b> earthquakes. We {{found that the}} ground motion generated by buried <b>rupture</b> in the period range around 1 second is on average 1.5 {{times larger than the}} average empirical relationship. In contrast, ground motion from earthquakes that <b>rupture</b> the surface is 1.5 times smaller in the same period range. This phenomenon is considered to be caused by differences in fault <b>rupture</b> process between the two types of earthquakes. To examine possible reasons of the above effect we analyzed source slip distribution data derived from waveform inversions, and divided them into two groups: surface <b>rupture</b> and buried <b>rupture</b> earthquakes. It was found that the large slip areas (asperities) of surface <b>rupture</b> earthquakes are concentrated in the depth range shallower than about 5 km. In contrast, large slip areas of buried <b>rupture</b> earthquakes are spread over the depth deeper than 5 km. We also found that the total <b>rupture</b> area of buried <b>rupture</b> earthquakes is 1.5 times smaller than that of surface <b>rupture</b> earthquakes having the same seismic moment, and that deep asperities have about 3 times larger effective stress drops and 2 times higher slip velocities than shallow asperities. These observations are verified by numerical simulations using stochastic Green’s function method.|$|R

25|$|This is {{so because}} the energy {{released}} in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, {{is proportional to}} the area of the fault that <b>ruptures</b> and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending down into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet which can store elastic energy and release it in fault <b>ruptures.</b> Rocks hotter than about 300 degrees Celsius flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes. The maximum observed lengths of <b>ruptures</b> and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1000nbsp&km. Examples are the earthquakes in Chile, 1960; Alaska, 1957; Sumatra, 2004, all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake <b>ruptures</b> on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939) and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.|$|E

30|$|The rapid {{development}} of a high-frequency sampling technique for GPS enables the <b>rupture</b> process inversion for a finite fault by using hr-GPS waveforms. One primary advantage of <b>rupture</b> inversion using hr-GPS data is that it essentially fits both the dynamic and static features to avoid inadequate weighting in different data types {{as long as the}} Green’s functions, including both dynamic and static responses, are computed. Thus far, relatively few works exist on <b>rupture</b> process models solely inverted from hr-GPS (Miyazaki et al. 2004; Yokota et al. 2009; Yue and Lay 2011), or on joint inversion combining hr-GPS with other datasets such as seismic waveforms (Yue and Lay 2013) or static GPS displacement (Vigny et al. 2011). The available studies have shown the ability of hr-GPS data to infer the <b>rupture</b> process of medium- and large-sized earthquakes. However, most of the previous works that model the <b>rupture</b> process using hr-GPS data assumed a priori <b>rupture</b> velocity and solved a linear system for slip history during the coseismic period. If an appropriate <b>rupture</b> velocity and a subfault source time function are selected that are long enough to span the actual <b>rupture</b> time, the <b>rupture</b> velocity will have negligible influence on the final cumulative slip (Yue and Lay 2011). However, Lee et al. (2011) showed that heterogeneous <b>rupture</b> velocity could influence the <b>rupture</b> process by the inversion of seismic waveforms. Konca et al. (2007) showed that non-uniform <b>rupture</b> velocities from 1.5 to 2.5  km/s are required to fit the seismic data for the 2005 Mw 8.6 Nias–Simeulue earthquake. In the present study, to better understand the <b>rupture</b> propagation process, we conduct <b>rupture</b> process inversions that allow for heterogeneous <b>rupture</b> velocity.|$|R
