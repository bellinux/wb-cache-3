5|$|After {{the release}} of the {{previous}} game in the Mana series, 1999's Legend of Mana, several members of the development team for the game left Square to form a new development studio, Brownie Brown. These included character designer Kameoka Shinichi and lead artist Kouji Tsuda, as well as several other writers and artists. Square, in turn, outsourced development of the fifth game in the Mana series to Brownie Brown. The producer for the game was Square's Koichi Ishii, who had directed or designed the previous games in the series. Ishii had served as the director for the original game in the series, Final Fantasy Adventure, which Sword of Mana is a remake of. The remake, in addition to adding enhanced graphics to the original Game Boy title, sought to add elements present in later games in the series, such as the Ring Command menu system, and to expand the game's storyline. It also <b>removed</b> <b>elements</b> from the Final Fantasy series, which had been placed in the original game {{as a part of the}} marketing for the game before its sequels moved to be a distinct series.|$|E

500|$|On September 22, 2006, Sound Transit and the Port of Seattle broke {{ground on}} the Airport Link extension, {{beginning}} three years of light rail and roadway construction. The airport's return-to-terminal ramps were closed for demolition in October, clearing {{the site of the}} future station. Construction of the SeaTac/Airport light rail station was bid out to Mowat Construction for $35.8 million in July 2007; the initial bid in March was set above Sound Transit's estimates at $95.3 million by Mowat, the sole bidder, and subsequently reduced the scope of the contract and <b>removed</b> <b>elements</b> of the station to bring costs down. A second contract signed with Mowat in February 2008 brought the total cost of the station's construction to $72 million. The [...] light rail guideway approaching the station would be built by PCL Construction as $38 million addition to their contract to build the guideway in Tukwila.|$|E

Additionally, the reporter gene must be inserted a set distance from the promoter for most promoters. In some methods of promoter bashing, multiple restriction digests are used to systematically <b>remove</b> <b>elements</b> of the promoters—this method ensures that the regions of the promoter removed do not contribute to reporter expression.|$|R
500|$|Before {{beginning}} work, {{the development}} team commissioned {{two pieces of}} music that they felt would inspire the right emotional tone for the game to guide their efforts. They created a number of prototypes, including concepts focused on growing flowers and based around human consciousness. The team decided that a prototype centered on petals floating in the wind best captured the emotions they wanted to evoke. They made keeping the player in a peaceful emotional state their design focus, and <b>removed</b> <b>elements</b> that frustrated players such as petal collection requirements to unlock levels and game mechanics that were too traditional and made the players too excited. The team tried to not place any barriers in the levels, allowing the player to go anywhere in an open world, but realized that without a few guidelines, such as the camera focusing on new flowers or segmenting the levels, players became confused and frustrated. Chen described the process as [...] "almost like we wanted to throw away the traditional game design, but we end up picking up all the pieces we threw away and putting them back because we know those are actually needed to deliver a good guided experience". The overall development time was two years, but the team spent three quarters of {{that time in the}} prototyping stage. After deciding on the game elements, Flower was produced in only six months.|$|E
500|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Hitoshi Sakimoto, {{who had also}} worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games. When he originally heard about the project, {{he thought it would}} be a light tone similar to other Valkyria Chronicles games, but found the themes much darker than expected. [...] An early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected. He redid the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to reassess the game. The main theme was initially recorded using orchestra, then Sakimoto <b>removed</b> <b>elements</b> such as the guitar and bass, then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before redoing segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme. The rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game's ending. The battle themes were designed around the concept of a [...] "modern battle" [...] divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments, constructed to create a sense of atonality. While Sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music, he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar. The guitar was played by Mitsuhiro Ohta, who also arranged several of the later tracks. The game's opening theme song, , was sung by Japanese singer May'n. Its theme was the reason soldiers fought, in particular their wish to protect what was precious to them rather than a sense of responsibility or duty. Its lyrics were written by Seiko Fujibayashi, who had worked on May'n on previous singles.|$|E
500|$|Ueda {{began working}} with {{producer}} Kenji Kaido in 1998 to develop the idea and bring the game to the PlayStation. [...] Icos design aesthetics were guided by three key notions: to make a game that would be different from others in the genre, feature an aesthetic style that would be consistently artistic, and play out in an imaginary yet realistic setting. [...] This was achieved {{through the use of}} [...] "subtracting design"; they <b>removed</b> <b>elements</b> from the game which interfered with the game's reality. [...] This included removing any form of interface elements, keeping the gameplay focused only on the escape from the castle, and reducing the number of types of enemies in the game to a single foe. An interim design of the game shows Ico and Yorda facing horned warriors similar to those that take Ico to the castle. The game originally focused on Ico's attempt to return Yorda to her room in the castle after she was kidnapped by these warriors. [...] Ueda believed this version had too much detail for the graphics engine they had developed, and as part of the [...] "subtracting design", replaced the warriors with the shadow creatures. [...] Ueda also brought in a number of people outside the video game industry to help with development. These consisted of two programmers, four artists, and one designer in addition to Ueda and Kaido, forming the base of what is now known as Team Ico. [...] On reflection, Ueda noted that the subtracting design may have taken too much out of the game, and did not go to as great an extreme with Shadow of the Colossus.|$|E

50|$|Another {{point of}} {{resemblance}} between the emblems of the Rus’ knyazes and {{the arms of}} the Bosporan tsars is the hereditary character of their development. As was already said above, the “coats of arms” of Rus’ knyazes were personal symbols, not passing on to descendants, but, as with the symbols of the Bosporan Kingdom, having one basis {{in the form of a}} bident, to which every ruler added (or from which they <b>removed)</b> <b>elements</b> in the form of various sorts of “offshoots”, curls, etc.|$|E
30|$|Image {{inpainting}} {{has been}} largely used for enhancing photos [170]. Through inpainting, one might <b>remove</b> an <b>element</b> which harms the composition of a photo [170]. Inpainting algorithms <b>remove</b> <b>elements</b> from photos by evaluating the surrounding indicated area with statistical analysis and filling this area with a surrounding-like texture. Inpainting may be obtained by combining texture synthesis, geometric partial differential equations (PDEs), and coherence among neighbor pixels [6]. Patch sparsity algorithms are used for improving image inpainting [170].|$|R

Nichols, under the pseudonym of [...] "Phantom Editor", released The Phantom Edit, an edited version of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, that <b>removed</b> <b>elements</b> {{of the film}} he found distracting. The Phantom Edit circulated online and received attention by the media for its attempt to improve upon the original film, which inspired others to attempt their edits of the film, or other films, and since then dozens more fan edits have been created.|$|E
5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of photography, people commonly hired painters and engravers to [...] "re-create" [...] an event or a scene. Artists had to imagine what to illustrate {{based on the information}} available to them about the subject. Some artists added elements to make the scene more exotic, while others <b>removed</b> <b>elements</b> out of modesty. In the 18th century, for example, Europeans were curious about what North America looked like and were ready to pay to see illustrations depicting this faraway place. Some of these artists produced prints depicting North America, despite many having never left Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Kashiram Das (কাশীরাম দাস, born 16th century) is an {{important}} poet in medieval Bengali literature. His Bengali re-telling of the Mahabharata, known as Kashidasi Mahabharat, is a popular and influential version of the Mahabharata legend in Bengal. Although the entire work is intra-textually ascribed to him, most scholars agree that he composed only the first four of the eighteen books (parvas). As with the Ramayana of Krittibas Ojha, Kashiram freely <b>removed</b> <b>elements</b> and added other legends to the story. Das is not a last name, but a title meaning [...] "servant" [...] in the Vaishnava tradition; the name is also written as Kashiramdas.|$|E
50|$|Touch rugby {{is often}} played informally, {{rather like a}} pick-up soccer or {{basketball}} game. In addition to tackles being replaced by touches, the rules of both rugby codes are simplified, <b>removing</b> <b>elements</b> such as scrums, rucks, mauls, line-outs and kicks.|$|R

Some cases of back-formation are based on folk etymology.|$|R
50|$|Although Friedrich's {{paintings}} are landscapes, he designed and painted {{them in his}} studio, using freely drawn plein air sketches, from which he chose the most evocative elements to integrate into an expressive composition. The composition of The Monk by the Sea shows evidence of this reductive process, as Friedrich <b>removed</b> <b>elements</b> from the canvas after they were painted. Recent scientific investigations have revealed that he had initially painted two small sailing ships on the horizon, which he later removed. Friedrich continued to modify {{the details of the}} painting right up to its exhibition—to the sky's grey was added blue, with stars and a moon—but the basic composition always stayed the same.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in the United States by American International Pictures with an English-language dub on 23 May 1969. The film premiered in the United States in Cincinnati. American International Pictures hired Titra Sound to dub the film into English. The American version of the film remains relatively close to the Japanese original. Among the more notable <b>removed</b> <b>elements</b> include Akira Ifukube's title theme and a brief shot of Minilla shielding his eyes when King Ghidorah drops Anguirus from the sky. Destroy All Monsters was show on American television stats until the early 1980s when it stopped being shown. It resurfaced on cable broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel in 1996.|$|E
5000|$|The first fan edit to popularize {{the field}} was The Phantom Edit, created in 2000 by {{professional}} editor Mike J. Nichols under the pseudonym of the [...] "Phantom Editor". Nichols <b>removed</b> <b>elements</b> from George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace that he felt detracted from the film, and made minor changes in dialogue, languages and subtitles to give the film's villains a more menacing tone. The end result was distributed on VHS and later online. The Phantom Edit {{was the first of}} many Star Wars fan edits to come, and has since inspired dozens of edits to surface on the internet.|$|E

5000|$|The two-story, {{frame house}} {{built on a}} stone {{foundation}} {{is an example of}} a popular 19th-century Vernacular house style in Davenport known as the McClelland. [...] It features a front gable, a three-bay facade with an entrance to one side, and a projecting polygonal window bay on the south side. Some of the embellishments that gave this house interest have either been covered with vinyl siding, or have been removed entirely. One of the <b>removed</b> <b>elements</b> was an Adamesque-style porch from around the turn of the 20th-century. [...] It was decorated with swags and ribbon motif in the pediment, and columns in the Tuscan order. It also featured ornamental shingling of the gable ends on the front and on the south side window bay. At one time the window surrounds had small bracketed cornices and heads with incised decorations.|$|E
