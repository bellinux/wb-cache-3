40|$|Over {{these last}} few years, {{there has been a}} growing {{interest}} in developing mechanical components from submicrometric materials due to the significant improvement that these materials present compared to their original state. This present research work deals with the study of the mechanical properties of a connecting rod isothermally forged from different starting materials. These materials are as follows: annealed aluminum alloy (AA) 5754, the same alloy previously deformed through equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) and a third case where the previously ECAP-processed material is subjected to a <b>recovery</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment.</b> A comparison is made between finite volume (FV) simulations and experimental tests with respect to hardness, plastic strain and forging force. Furthermore, the improvement in the mechanical properties of the connecting rod forged from predeformed material is evaluated in comparison to the connecting rod forged with annealed material. The microstructure of both cases is also compared {{at the end of the}} manufacturing process.

40|$|Superelasticity {{phenomena}} and Impact behaviour {{have been studied}} on Ti 50 Ni 50 and Ti 50 Ni 48 Fe 2 shape memory alloys. Both alloys {{have been made by}} powder metallurgy (combustion synthesis). The main objective of the present work was to induce superelastic properties for temperatures ranging from - 25 °C to 0 °C on a TiNi-based alloy by the addition of 2 % Fe. It is well known that superelasticity properties are enhanced by the occurence of premartensitic R phase transition. On the other hand, Fe addition decreases the martensitic transformation temperature (Ms) promoting the occurence of intermediate "premartensitic" R phase. For binary TiNi alloys, cold working and partial <b>recovery</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> is necessary to obtain such as properties. This paper describes the microstructure, superelasticity and Charpy Impact behaviour of both Ti 50 Ni 50 and Ti 50 Ni 48 Fe 2. Results have shown that : Impact energy curves display unexpected trend for testing temperatures ranging from - 196 to + 50 °C. In particular, for TiNiFe alloy, typical Impact energy values are : 25 J/cm 2 at - 196 OC, 4 J/cm 2 at - 25 °C (the minimal value obtained) and 20 J/cm 2 at + 20 °C. Complementary fractographic examinations have shown a brittle fracture mode for test temperatures ranging from - 25 to 0 °C. On the other hand, these temperatures correspond to the maximum of superelasticity, that is 1. 5 to 2 % of reversible strain measured by loading and unloading during tensile test. These results show a high brittleness probably induced by the intermediate "R" phase. Consequently, the optimization of superelasticity should be detrimental to the ductility/toughness of the TiNi alloys...|$|E

In sub-lethally heat-damaged cells, low reducing and acid conditions allowed growth ability to be rapidly regained, but a decrease in the redox potential and pH brought about a longer lag phase and a slower exponential growth rate, and even led to growth failure (pH 5. 0, < or =- 100 mV) ...|$|R

Incubation of S. typhimurium LT- 2 in water at 50 C for 15 min did not change the sedimentation patterns of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in alkaline sucrose gradients. The same pattern was obtained if the heated cells were further incubated for 15 min at 37 C in M- 9 broth. However, a marked increase in DNA single-strand breakage accompanied by a loss of viability was observed after a similar incubation of heated bacteria in TSY broth. If heated bacteria were incubated in M- 9 broth before TSY broth, there was {{a decrease in the}} single-strand breakage occurring in the TSY broth.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{electron}} transport chain, Rubisco and stomatal conductance {{are important}} in photosynthesis. Little is known about their combined responses to <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at different temperatures and following recovery in grapevines (Vitis spp.) which are often grown in climates with high temperatures. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: The electron transport function of photosystem II, the activation state of Rubisco {{and the influence of}} stomatal behavior were investigated in grapevine leaves during <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> and following <b>recovery.</b> High temperature treatments included 35, 40 and 45 °C, with 25 °C as the control and <b>recovery</b> temperature. <b>Heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at 35 °C did not significantly (P> 0. 05) inhibit net photosynthetic rate (P(n)). However, with treatments at 40 and 45 °C, P(n) was decreased, accompanied by an increase in substomatal CO(2) concentration (C(i)), decreases in stomatal conductance (g(s)) and the activation state of Rubisco, and inhibition of the donor side and the reaction center of PSII. The acceptor side of PSII was inhibited at 45 °C but not at 40 °C. When grape leaves recovered following <b>heat</b> <b>treatment,</b> P(n), g(s) and the activation state of Rubisco also increased, and the donor side and the reaction center of PSII recovered. The increase in P(n) during the recovery period following the second 45 °C stress was slower than that following the 40 °C stress, and these increases corresponded to the donor side of PSII and the activation state of Rubisco. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at 35 °C did not significantly (P> 0. 05) influence photosynthesis. The decrease of P(n) in grape leaves exposed to more severe heat stress (40 or 45 °C) was mainly attributed to three factors: the activation state of Rubisco, the donor side and the reaction center of PSII. However, the increase of P(n) in grape leaves following heat stress was also associated with a stomatal response. The acceptor side of PSII in grape leaves was responsive but less sensitive to heat stress...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{structural}} <b>recovery</b> upon <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> of {{a highly}} metamict, actinide-rich zircon (U~ 6000 ppm) has been studied in detail using a range of techniques including X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, SHRIMP ion probe, electron microprobe, transmission electron microscopy and cathodoluminescence analysis. The structural regeneration of the amorphous starting material depends on random nucleation. It starts between 800 and 950 °C when amorphous ZrSiO 4 decomposes to form crystalline ZrO 2 and amorphous SiO 2. At around 1100 °C, well-crystallised ZrSiO 4 grows {{at the expense of}} the oxides. U has been retained in the newly grown zircon whereas Pb was evaporated during the <b>heat</b> <b>treatment.</b> This process is in marked opposition to the reconstitution of moderately metamict minerals, which experience a gradual recovery controlled by the epitaxial growth at the crystalline–amorphous boundaries. Both of these recovery processes are not the direct inverse of metamictisation. The structural regeneration was found to be connected with a significant increase in the emission of CL. In all cases (annealing heavily damaged zircon and moderately damaged zircon and monazite), we observe that the final, wellcrystallised annealing products emit more intense CL than their radiation-damaged starting minerals, although having almost identical elemental composition. Our observations are taken as evidence that the CL is not only determined by the chemical composition of the sample but is also strongly controlled by structural parameters such as crystallinity or the presence of defect centres...|$|R

In the current communication we studied the recovery and outgrowth of individually sorted spores in BHI and rice broth media and on agar plates using flow cytometry (FCM). We show that <b>recovery</b> of wet <b>heat</b> treated Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 spores is affected by matrix composition with highest recovery in BHI broth or on rice agar plates, compared to BHI agar plates and rice broth. Data show that not only media composition but also its liquid or solid state affect the <b>recovery</b> of <b>heat</b> treated spores. To determine the impact of factors with putative roles in <b>recovery</b> of <b>heat</b> treated spores, specific genes previously shown to be highly expressed in outgrowing heat-treated spores were selected for mutant construction. Spores of nine B. cereus ATCC 14579 deletion mutants were obtained and their <b>recovery</b> from wet <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> was evaluated using BHI and rice broth and agar plates. Deletion mutant spores showed different capacity to recover from <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> compared to wild type with the most pronounced effect for a mutant lacking BC 5242, a gene encoding a membrane protein with C 2 C 2 zinc finger which resulted in over 95 % reduction in recovery compared to the wild type in BHI broth.

We obtained insights {{on the impact of}} matrix composition and state on recovery of individually sorted heat treated spores and identified cellular factors with putative roles in this process.

40|$|Shape {{memory alloy}} actuators’ strokes can be {{increased}} {{at the expense of}} <b>recovery</b> force via <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> to form compressed springs in their heat-activated, austenitic state. Although there are models to explain their behaviour, few investigations present experimental results for support or validation. The aim of the present paper is to determine via experimentation how certain parameters affect a helical shape memory alloy actuator’s outputs: its transformation times and stroke. These parameters include wire diameter, spring diameter, transition temperature, number of active turns, bias force and direct current magnitude. Six investigations were performed: one for each parameter manipulation. For repeatability and to observe thermo-mechanical training effects, the springs were cyclically activated. The resultant patterns were compared with results predicted from one-dimensional models to elucidate the findings. Generally, it was observed that the transformation times and strokes converged at changing stress levels; the convergence is likely the peak where the summation of elastic stroke and transformation stroke has reached its maximum. During cyclic loading, the actuators’ strokes decreased to a converged value, particularly at larger internal stresses; training should therefore be performed prior to the actuator’s implementation for continual use applications...|$|R

40|$|Several biotechnological {{processes}} {{can show}} an undesirable formation of emulsions making difficult phase separation and product recovery. The breakup of oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by yeast was studied using different {{physical and chemical}} methods. These emulsions were composed by deionized water, hexadecane and commercial yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The stability of the emulsions was evaluated varying the yeast concentration from 7. 47 to 22. 11 % (w/w) and the phases obtained after gravity separation were evaluated on chemical composition, droplet size distribution, rheological behavior and optical microscopy. The cream phase showed kinetic stability attributed to mechanisms as electrostatic repulsion between the droplets, a possible Pickering-type stabilization and the viscoelastic properties of the concentrated emulsion. Oil recovery from cream phase was performed using gravity separation, centrifugation, heating and addition of demulsifier agents (alcohols and magnetic nanoparticles). Long centrifugation time and high centrifugal forces (2 h/ 150, 000 x g) were necessary to obtain a complete oil <b>recovery.</b> The <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> (60 degrees C) {{was not enough to}} promote a satisfactory oil separation. Addition of alcohols followed by centrifugation enhanced oil recovery: butanol addition allowed almost complete phase separation of the emulsion while ethanol addition resulted in 84 % of oil recovery. Implementation of this method, however, would require additional steps for solvent separation. Addition of charged magnetic nanoparticles was effective by interacting electrostatically with the interface, resulting in emulsion destabilization under a magnetic field. This method reached almost 96 % of oil recovery and it was potentially advantageous since no additional steps might be necessary for further purifying the recovered oil. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

A 10 or 20 mm long segment of the nerve was irradiated intraoperatively using 50 kV X-rays. Hyperthermia (30 min at 45 degrees C), was applied to the irradiated part (over a length of 5 mm) of the nerve using a brass thermode. Functional damage to the nerve was assessed using the toe-spreading test, which mainly assesses the motor function of the sciatic nerve. Radiation alone (doses up to 70 Gy) did not lead to detectable damage for at least 90 weeks. Hyperthermia alone (30 min at 45 degrees C) resulted in complete loss of motor function. This function loss was transient and complete recovery took place in about 4 weeks. Recovery time was scored as the number of days between hyperthermia and the day on which 50 % of the motor function had returned. Irradiation (35 Gy) of a nerve segment, which included the heated part, resulted in a delayed <b>recovery</b> from the <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> compared to controls (heat only). The time interval and sequence between irradiation and hyperthermia hardly influenced the recovery delay. The size of the irradiated nerve segment did influence the recovery delay.

It {{can be said that}} the grinding process performed before varnishing is influential on the results; it was observed that the grinding of the samples where structural damage and mass losses occurred after <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> leads to more deformation depending on the increases of <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> temperature. This situation effectively decreases surface quality and increases roughness [14]. In a previous study, it was stated that a considerable decrease in abrasion resistance of wooden material occurs in a manner dependent on the temperature increase after the <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> process [33]. In another study, it was stated that surface roughness values increase with increasing temperature of the <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> applied [34].|$|R

However, me-chanical properties of wood can be deteriorated during the <b>heat</b> <b>treatment.</b> The effect of <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> on the bending strength and hardness of wood for Korean paulownia, Pinus densiflora, Lidiodendron tuli-pifera and Betula costata were measured. The <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> temperature {{has been investigated}} at 175 °C and 200 °C, respectively.

This study evaluated {{the effect of}} <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> on some physical and mechanical properties and colour of Eucalyptus wood (Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehn.), which has industrially high usage potential and large plantations in Turkey. Wood specimens from Tarsus, Turkey were subjected to <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> in varying temperatures and durations.

The microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of both as-fabricated and heat-treated specimens were investigated to assess the effect of different <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> conditions, by using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Neutron Diffraction and tensile tests. The results indicated that <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> promotes the formation of the γ phase in the majority region after <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at 1200 °C for 24 h, while a fully lamellar structure was formed in the near-substrate zone. The response to <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at 1060 °C/ 24 h was markedly different, producing a fine lamellar structure with differing sizes in the majority region and near-substrate zone. These various microstructural characteristics determined the mechanical properties of the heat-treated samples. The heat-treated samples at 1200 °C/ 24 h exhibited lower UTS and microhardness values but higher ductility than the as-fabricated samples without <b>heat</b> <b>treatment,</b> while the 1060 °C/ 24 h <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> resulted in higher UTS and microhardness values but lower ductility. Due to the homogenous microstructure in the majority region after each postproduction <b>heat</b> <b>treatment,</b> the tensile properties were similar for both the build direction (Z) and travel direction (Y), thereby minimising the anisotropy that is exhibited by the as-fabricated alloy prior to <b>heat</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|R
