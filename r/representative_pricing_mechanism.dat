40|$|Like other markets, {{the plea}} {{bargaining}} market uses a <b>pricing</b> <b>mechanism</b> to coordinate market functions and to communicate critical information to participants, information that permits rational decisionmaking {{in the face}} of uncertainty. Because plea bargaining plays such a prominent role in the administration of criminal justice, and because the <b>pricing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> inherent in plea bargaining can - like <b>pricing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> generally - both explain past conduct by market participants and predict future conduct, close scrutiny of the <b>pricing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> at work in plea bargaining is amply justified. This Article explores several features of the plea bargaining system in light of economic insights borrowed from basic price theory. That analysis suggests several structural flaws of the plea market that could, in theory, be amenable to reform efforts.

40|$|We {{study the}} revenue {{performance}} of sequential posted <b>price</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and some natural extensions, {{for a general}} setting where the valuations of the buyers are drawn from a correlated distribution. Sequential posted <b>price</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are conceptually simple mechanisms that work by proposing a “take-it-or-leave-it” offer to each buyer. We apply sequential posted <b>price</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to single-parameter multi-unit settings in which each buyer demands only one item and the mechanism can assign the service to at most k of the buyers. For standard sequential posted <b>price</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> we prove that with the valuation distribution having finite support, no sequential posted <b>price</b> <b>mechanism</b> can extract a constant fraction of the optimal expected revenue, even with unlimited supply. We extend this result {{to the case of}} a continuous valuation distribution when various standard assumptions hold simultaneously. In fact, {{it turns out that the}} best fraction of the optimal revenue that is extractable by a sequential posted <b>price</b> <b>mechanism</b> is proportional to the ratio of the highest and lowest possible valuation. We prove that for two simple generalizations of these mechanisms, a better revenue performance can be achieved: if the sequential posted <b>price</b> <b>mechanism</b> has for each buyer the option of either proposing an offer or asking the buyer for its valuation, then a Ω(1 / max{ 1, d}) fraction of the optimal revenue can be extracted, where d denotes the “degree of dependence” of the valuations, ranging from complete independence (d = 0) to arbitrary dependence (d = n− 1). When we generalize the sequential posted <b>price</b> <b>mechanisms</b> further, such that the mechanism has the ability to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the i-th buyer that depends on the valuations of all buyers except i, we prove that a constant fraction (2 − (Formula presented) / 4 ≈ 0. 088 of the optimal revenue can be always extracted. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015...|$|R

40|$|Pay What You Want (PWYW) pricing has {{received}} considerable attention recently. Empirical {{studies show that}} a PWYW <b>pricing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is able to increase a seller’s turnover and profit. This paper addresses PWYW pricing for bundles of experience goods. The paper shows that a PWYW <b>pricing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> if applied ex post consumption, separates the decision to buy from the decision how much to pay. Information asymmetries {{about the quality of}} the good are reduced during the act of consumption so that buyers are informed about the product’s quality when they decide how much to pay. As a consequence, risk-averse buyers who would otherwise refrain from purchasing under a fixed <b>price</b> <b>mechanism,</b> can be attracted to purchase under a PWYW pricing ex post consumption (PWYW-EPC) mechanism. In this case, the <b>pricing</b> <b>mechanism</b> itself constitutes a signal. The paper concludes that a PWYW <b>pricing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> applied ex post consumption, can be a profitable strategy for a seller if she sells bundles of experience goods and if she wants to attract risk-averse buyers for realizing economies of scale in production. ...|$|R

This Part thereafter demonstrates why the antidumping regime, as well as the proposed <b>pricing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> cannot be justified under the competition policy standards. While criticizing defenses for the current antidumping regime, Part III demonstrates why the proposed <b>pricing</b> <b>mechanism</b> may result in overregulation and thus is inconsistent with the OECD Council 2 ̆ 7 s Mandate. Part IV shows why candidates for market-distorting pricing practices-for example, predatory/strategic dumping-are unlikely to occur in the shipbuilding industry, and therefore there is no strong need to have alternative mechanisms. While reconfirming that antidumping-type pricing disciplines are inappropriate in the shipbuilding industry, this Part cautiously introduces a competition law model and modified <b>pricing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to directly target predatory/strategic dumping or other types of market-distorting pricing practices.

Furthermore, the relatively low production costs of the privately owned Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (FPCC) disclosed the <b>pricing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of CPC, which inspired FPCC to adopt pricing strategy in order to increase the market share. This study aims to establish a system dynamics model to analyze the effects of the floating <b>price</b> <b>mechanism</b> on Taiwan's gasoline and diesel markets. This Model is divided into four sub-systems. The model of this study passed several validation tests, and hence, is able to provide a "virtual laboratory" for policy-makers to conduct simulation and scenario analysis.
