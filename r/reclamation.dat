5|$|Between 1631 and 1890, {{the city}} tripled its area through land <b>reclamation</b> by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along the waterfront. The largest <b>reclamation</b> efforts {{took place during}} the 19th century; {{beginning}} in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a 50-acre (20ha) mill pond that later became the Haymarket Square area. The present-day State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. <b>Reclamation</b> projects {{in the middle of the}} century created significant parts of the South End, the West End, the Financial District, and Chinatown.|$|E

5|$|In 1873, Barton S. Alexander {{completed}} a {{report for the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{that was the first}} attempt at creating a Central Valley Project. In 1904, the Bureau of <b>Reclamation</b> (then the <b>Reclamation</b> Service) first became interested in creating such a water project, but did not get far involved until a series of droughts and related disasters occurred in the early 1920s. The State of California passed the Central Valley Project Act in 1933, which authorized <b>Reclamation</b> to sell revenue bonds in order to raise about $170 million for the project. Unfortunately, because of insufficient money in the state's treasury and the coincidence with the Great Depression, California turned to the national government for funding to build the project. This resulted in several transfers of the project between California and the federal government, and between <b>Reclamation</b> and the Army Corps of Engineers. The first dams and canals of the project started going up in the late 1930s, and the last facilities were completed in the early 1970s. Other features of the project were never constructed, some lie partly finished, or are still awaiting authorization.|$|E

5|$|With lumber {{a declining}} {{industry}} in the upper Klamath Basin, the economy slowly transitioned to agriculture. The Klamath <b>Reclamation</b> Project, established by the Bureau of <b>Reclamation</b> in the early 20th century, involved the construction of two dams on the river and additional dams on many of its tributaries, {{as well as the}} final draining of Lower Klamath and Tule Lakes. The Bureau of <b>Reclamation</b> was not the only user of the river during this period; in the late 1950s PacifiCorp and California-Oregon Power Company (COPCO) constructed three more dams on the river downstream. These dams, however, sparked a great controversy over water quality in the lower section of the river and the dependence of the river's annual salmon runs on it.|$|E

It encompasses a survey of 209 documented vacancies. Findings reveal that about one-half of the surveyed industrial building vacancies were reclaimed for some specific use, and the balance remained vacant or were demolished. The majority of all <b>reclamations</b> were reclaimed by non-industrial uses. Less intensive use of building space was common in both industrial and non-industrial <b>reclamations.</b> Churches, eating and drinking estab-lishments, auto parts, furniture, and upholstery stores dominated non-industrial recla-mations (service establishments presumably oriented to the local black population); industrial <b>reclamations</b> were primarily fabricated metals, construction, printing and publishing, and miscellaneous repair services. For several decades much research has focused on the reloca-tion of industrial establishments and, to a lesser extent, the resultant impacts of these relocations on central city tax base...|$|R
50|$|Land <b>reclamations</b> west of Langeø (Frederiksholm) {{and north}} of Christianshom led to the {{establishment}} of two new islands for the storage of anchors and ships ballast after the first Anchor and Ballast Islands had been become part of Nyholm. By further <b>reclamations</b> they grew together and in 1858 a large drydock was constructed at the island as a replacement for Gammel Dok at Christianshavn. After this, the island became known as Dokøen (English: The Dock Island). In 1925 the island was annexed to Frederiksholm, but kept its own name.|$|R
5|$|Marble Hill is {{one example}} of how Manhattan's land has been {{considerably}} altered by human intervention. The borough has seen substantial land <b>reclamation</b> along its waterfronts since Dutch colonial times, and much of the natural variation in its topography has been evened out.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few years, while all {{construction}} was stayed, <b>Reclamation</b> conducted evaluations of the seismic potential of the dam site, even though these delays caused {{the cost of the}} project to rise with every passing year. The studies concluded that a major fault system underlay the vicinity of the Auburn Dam site, with many folds of metamorphic rock formed by the contact of the foothill rocks and the granite batholith of the Sierra Nevada. <b>Reclamation</b> predicted that the Auburn Reservoir could induce an earthquake of up to a 6.5, while the U.S. Geological Survey projected a higher magnitude of 7.0. Nevertheless, <b>Reclamation</b> redesigned the Auburn Dam based on their 6.5 figure, even though a 7.0 would be three times stronger. The design for the Auburn Dam was changed to a concrete thick-arch gravity dam, to provide better protection against a possible earthquake induced by its own reservoir.|$|E
5|$|The dam was {{authorized}} in 1944 {{as a unit}} of the federal Central Valley Project, a system designed to provide irrigation water to the fertile agricultural region of the Central Valley. It would be built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), and transferred to the U.S. Bureau of <b>Reclamation</b> (<b>Reclamation)</b> upon completion. In 1966, work began to clear the foundations for a high dam that would replace an earlier, much smaller structure built by two irrigation districts. Construction of the main embankment began in 1976, and was topped out in late 1978. Water storage in New Melones Lake commenced in 1978, and the dam's hydroelectric station produced its first power in mid-1979.|$|E
