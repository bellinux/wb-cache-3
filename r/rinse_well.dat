40|$|The subject {{invention}} {{relates to}} a human cleansing agent particularly suitable for use in long duration spaceflight and to a method of bathing with the agent. The agent of the subject invention {{is in the form}} of a paste having a pH of 5. 0 to 7. 9 which comprises an acyltaurate, a skin conditioner, a hair conditioner, and a preservative. More specifically, it includes sodium N-coconut acid-N-methyl taurate, in combination with soybean lecithin, polyquaternium 16, and formalin. This particular combination satisfies the following objectives: (1) that it be usable with a minimum amount of water per shower (approximately 1 gallon); (2) that it be easily separated from the water for purposes of water reclamation; (3) that it be pH compatible with skin and hair; (4) that it <b>rinse</b> <b>well</b> in deionized water; (5) that it be mild to skin and eyes; (6) that it effectively clean both skin and hair; (7) that it be suitable for use in zero gravity; and (8) that it provide ease of combing of wet and dry hair. The method of the invention includes the steps of wetting the skin and hair with a small quantity of water, lathering the skin with the paste, rinsing the lather from the skin and hair with a small quantity of water to produce a rinse water containing the cleansing agent, defoaming the rinse water, and supplying the defoamed rinse water to a water reclamation unit for recycling the water.

40|$|Fruits may be canned {{with the}} boiling water bath method because they contain high enough acid levels to prevent the growth of Clostridium botulinum spores and the {{production}} of botulism toxin. Additionally, when fruits are properly canned, they are heated long enough at high enough temperatures to destroy spoilage causing microorganisms. Equipment A water bath canner can be any large metal container with a fitted lid deep enough to fit a rack on the bottom, the jars, 1 to 2 inches of water above jars, and 2 to 4 inches of space to allow for boiling. A pressure canner also may be used in place of a water bath canner if it is deep enough. Place the lid, but do not fasten it. Leave the petcock and/or vent open so steam can escape and pressure does not build up during heating. As with a water bath canner, the jars need to be covered with 1 to 2 inches of water during processing, and space for boiling should be considered. Use standard canning jars and lids. Commercial food jars, such as mayonnaise and coffee jars, are not recommended because these jars may not properly seal {{and are more likely to}} break than standard canning jars. Check jars, ringbands, and lids for defects. Look for chips, cracks, dents, rust, and anything else that will prevent airtight seals. Wash jars in hot soapy water and <b>rinse</b> <b>well.</b> Prepare two-piece metal lids according to manufacturer’s directions. Ringbands may be reused if they are not rusted, dented, or damaged; however, lids may only be used once. Preparing the Produce Choose fresh, firm fruits for canning. Wash all fruit thoroughly regardless of whether or not it will be pared. Do not soak; soaking may cause the fruit to lose flavor and nutrients. Handle gently to avoid bruising. Preventing Darkening Some fruits darken when they are peeled or cut and then exposed to air. Choose one of the following treatments to retard this natural occurrence while preparing fruit for canning...|$|E

[Label your protein with 32 Pi]([URL] Then {{subject the}} protein to SDS {{polyacrylamide}} gel electrophoresis and [transfer your gel-fractionated protein to Immobilon-P]([URL] - **Neither nitrocellulose nor nylon will work!** - Keep the membrane wet and wrap in Saran wrap. - Add radioactive markings for orientation of film later - Expose to film. - Cut out band of interest, re-wet in methanol, <b>rinse</b> <b>well</b> in water {{and place in a}} screw-cap tube containing 150 µl 5. 7 N HCl or enough to submerge your piece of membrane. - Incubate in 110 °C oven for 60 min. - Microfuge sample full speed for at least 1 min. - Transfer supernatant to new tube and lyophilize on Speedivac. (It takes about 3 hr.) - Resuspend in H 2 O, and microfuge 5 min. Spotting more than 3 µl is tedious, so don't use much H 20. On the other hand, I wouldn't use much less than 6 µl so as to have good recovery. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") 7. Spot 1 µl PAA standards (about 0. 3 µg each of PSer, PThr, and PTyr) on a cellulose thin layer chromatography plate and then spot your sample. We use 0. 1 mm EM cellulose plates - You can spot the whole sample if you are skillful and have no choice because you don't have many counts. - Spot 0. 25 - 0. 30 µl at a time and dry with house air, blown through a plugged pipet, between applications. *How do I wet the plate? We use a blotter that has four, 2 cm, circular holes cut out of it, one for each origin. We cut the holes with a sharp cork borer. The blotter can be made from a good grade of blotting paper, or two layers of Whatmann 3 MM sewn together. It should be wet, but not dripping. For the first dimension, you wet the plate with pH 1. 9 buffer. * 8. Electrophorese at pH 1. 9, 1. 5 KV, 20 min in the first dimension. 9. Let plate air dry well. *How do I wet the plate for the second dimension? Use three rectangular pieces of Whatmann 3 MM that have been wet with pH 3. 5 buffer. Wet the bottom of the plate below the lower two origins. Keep the paper at least 1 cm away from where the PAAs are. Then wet the area between the 4 origins. Finally wet the top of the plate. The blotters should be quite damp, but not soaking wet*. 10. Rotate 90 ° counter clockwise. Electrophorese at pH 3. 5, 1. 6 KV, 13 min in the second dimension. *The above electrophoresis times are appropriate when you are using a Salk/TVL/MBVL type electrophoresis rig. A knock off of this is sold by CBS scientific. If you are using another rig, you will have to optimize your electrophoresis times*. 11. Dry plate in oven. 12. Spray plate with ninhydrin sol'n for several seconds. Incubate in oven until can see purple spots of PAA standards. 15 min should be plenty. 13. Mark the plate with radioactive ink so that you can extrapolate where the origins were and can align the film unambigously with the plate and the PAA markers. 14. Expose the plate to flashed film with a screen a - 70 °C. Film is much preferable to the phosphorimager because it is transparent and is exactly {{the same size as the}} plate and this facilitates alignment of the film and the plate. In the rare case that you need quantification, you can use the phosphorimager. 15. After developing the film, trace the locations of the PAA standards and the radioactive ink marks onto a Xerox transpancy and save this in your notebook. This is what a perfect plate looks like: ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") ### Recipes: In general, you will need 2 liters of each buffer. 1. pH 1. 9 buffer. - 88 % Formic acid 	 50 ml - Acetic acid 	 156 ml - H 2 O 	 1794 ml - Don't use the 98 % formic acid and don't adjust the pH. - pH 3. 5 buffer - Pyridine 	 10 ml - Acetic acid 	 100 ml - 100 mmolar EDTA 	 10 ml - H 2 O 	 1880 ml - Don't bother to adjust the pH. *There have been occasional problems with badly smeared PAAs during electrophoresis at pH 3. 5. Something seems to leach out of the wicks and make the PAAs relatively insoluble. Tony thinks it is aluminum. Bart thinks that it's calcium. In any case, this problem can be prevented by including 0. 5 mM EDTA in the 3. 5 buffer*. ### References: This two dimensional technique was originally developed, in large part by [Tony Hunter]([URL] for analysis of cell extracts or proteins eluted from ground up gels.

(N. B. Cells are sensitive to cold and aspirating therefore hand aspirate.) ### 2.) IMMORTALIZING BROWN FAT CELLS- ESTABLISHING CELL LINES After cells are plated overnight, (day 1), next day wash cells (day 2), on day 3 need to add virus (pBabe SV 40 Large T antigen puromycin). *(preparation of viral stock see protocol 3) * To each well add: VIRUS SOLUTION which consists of: 1) 50 % primary culture media, 2) 50 % viral stock, 3) 1 X polybreen- 8 mg/ml stock solution dissolved in ddH 2 O- final conc. 4 ug/ml(1 : 2000 dilution) (hexadimethrine bromide, Sigma, catalog # H- 9268) 1), 2), 3), should add up to approximately 0. 9 ml/well. For example: if there are 6 wells with cells to be immortalized you need 6 (X) (0. 9 ml) = 5. 4 ml total volume containing primary culture media, viral stock and polybreen. Thus, take 2. 7 mls of primary culture media, 2. 7 mls of viral stock, and 2. 7 ul of polybreen stock, mix by pipetting, filter sterile using a 0. 45 micron filter. Then, for each well, pipette off media, DO NOT USE VACUUM (vacuum will disrupt cells too much), <b>rinse</b> <b>well</b> with 2 mls pre-warmed primary culture media, pipette off rinsing media and add VIRUS SOLUTION VERY SLOWLY!!!!!!! NEXT DAY: split cells into 15 cm dishes - pipette off VIRUS SOLUTION - <b>rinse</b> <b>well</b> with 2 mls DMEM - high (without FBS) - pipette off, put in ≅ 0. 2 ml trypsin for ≅ 3 minutes (until cells just come off plate) - add 2 mls primary culture media, transfer to 15 cm dish containing 25 mls primary culture media. TWO DAYS LATER: start puromycin (Sigma, catalog # P 8833) selection (2 ug/ml puromycin into DMEM high (+) 20 % FBS). Leave in puromycin media for one week. (At this point some cells can be split off to differentiate or do some experiments with.) After puromycin selection cells need {{to be put into}} media directed against *mycoplasma* *infection* (BM Cyclin, Boehringer Mannheim, catalog # 799 050). This will take approximately 2 - 3 weeks.

The cells are grown in DMEM-High + 10 % FBS at 5 % CO 2. - The cells grow rapidly. - The cells come off of the dish very easily so be careful when washing/feeding them. - The cells are frozen in 90 % FBS + 10 % DMSO (dimethly sulfoxide) - It is recommended that the cells are not allowed to reach confluence and that they are periodically grown in selection media to maintain their retroviral packaging “goodies”. **φNX Cell Selection Media** DMEM-High + 10 % FBS + 300 ug/ml Hygromycin B + 1 ug/ml Diptheria Toxin A The cells will round up some, they don’t look very good but it’s OK. The cells need to be in selection only about 4 - 7 days, then place themback into regular media and allow them to “recover” to their normal morphology before using and/or freezing them. Additional information and more details regarding the φ NX cells can be found on the Nolan lab homepage at: www. Stanford. edu/group/Nolan/. ### 4.) CULTURING BROWN FAT CELLS ### Media: 1. DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS - DMEM high no FBS (for rinsing cells) -always use new pipette - DMEM high no FBS (for starving cells) - DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS (+) insulin and T 3 - Differentiation Media - Induction Media (see below) ### Typical Differentiation Time Course: - Day 1 - split into Differentiation Media - 2 - 3 - Day 4 - induce confluent cells - 5 - Day 6 - put back into Differentiation media - 7 - 8 - aspirate off old media and add fresh Differentiation media - 9 - Day 10 - fully differentiated cells ready to be used for: Oil Red O staining, RNA/DNA extraction, Western analysis etc. **MASTER PLATE** - one large dish 15 cm - Always in DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS **To split**: if confluent a 1 : 20 split (ie. - 1 ml cells plus 25 mls media will reach confluence in 3 days) - Aspirate off media - Rinse cells using DMEM high (no FBS) - fill 25 ml pipette to top- rinse each Master plate with 18 ml - Add 2. 5 mls trypsin/plate (always use new pipette) - Put back into CO 2 for at least 20 mins. (while trypsinizing label other plates/dishes) - (leave cells alone while trypsinizing- this seems to help avoid cells from clumping) **Preparation for “Splitting” Plates** - decide what kind and how many plates are needed: ie: - 6 well plate- gets 4 mls differentiation media plus 12 drops of cells - 12 well plate: gets 2 mls differentiation media - 10 cm dish- gets 8 mls Differentiation media (+) 3 ml cells- usually can get 2 - 4 mg protein - 15 cm dish- Master plate – ALWAYS gets 25 mls DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS **After labelling plates:** - Take out trypsinized Master Plate - Add 25 mls DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS, pipette up and down three times to disperse cells and break up clumps - add - 1 ml to Master plate, - 12 drops into 4 mls differentiation media- 6 well plate, - 3 mls cells into 8 mls differentiation media- 10 cm. Dish - while plating out one cell type-others can remain in trypsin in the hood - when done “splitting” cells take Master plate and 10 cm dish and “distribute” cells evenly by moving dishes in a “figure eight” configuration ten times (for 6 well plates use a “faster” figure eight) FREEZING CELLS- freeze cells in DMEM high (+) 20 % FBS (+) 10 % DMSO ![Table 2]([URL] "Table 2 ") INDUCTION MEDIA - when cells are confluent - prepare fresh – use only on the day you need it - Aspirate off differentiation media and add induction media- no rinsing - 11 mls per plate - For 200 mls Media: add 200 mls Differentiation media to top of 500 ml filter bottle add: 1. 0. 125 M indomethacin (1000 X) - 200 ul (Sigma, catalog # I- 7378) - 2 mg/ml dexamethasone-vortex (1000 X) - 200 ul (Sigma, catalog # D- 1756) - 0. 25 M IBMX (500 X) - 400 ul-(Sigma, catalog # I- 5879) must add immediately after thawing - thaw - vortex - add back to heating block - all three are dissolved in 100 % ethanol and stored frozen in (-) 20 freezer - 1) and 3) must be heated to 75 °C (use heating block) ### 5.) OIL RED O STAINING PROTOCOL This protocol is used to test for lipid accumulation in fully differentiated cells. Stock Oil Red O: 0. 5 g Oil Red O (Sigma, catalog # 0 - 0625) in 100 ml isopropanol 1. Rinse plates with PBS - Fix cells by covering with PBS + 10 % formaldehyde or with commercially available buffered formalin (Sigma, catalog # HT 50 - 1 - 640) - Let plates sit at least 15 min. or as long as overnight, at room temperature, alternatively plates can be left @ 4 °C until multiple plates are collected. - Prepare Oil Red O working solution (make fresh each time, as working solution is unstable) by adding 6 ml stock to 4 ml ddH 20. Mix and filter through Whatman # 1 filter paper. (The filtration step takes awhile; it is not advisable to hasten the process by applying a vacuum because there is too much stuff to filter out.) Make about 5 ml per 10 cm plate to be stained. - Remove fixation agent, add Oil Red O stain. - Sit 1 hour (or longer) at room temperature. - Rinse several times, carefully, with distilled water to remove excess stain and any precipitate that forms. - Maintain dishes in water if intact cells are desired. - Pour off distilled water and allow dishes to air dry. - Scan plate...|$|E
30|$|To {{estimate}} {{the amount of}} cell death in tomato leaves induced by FA treatment, the methodology of Baker and Mock ([1994]) was followed. The FA-treated and control leaf tissues were submerged in 10 ml plastic beakers containing 1 ml of 0.25 % Evans blue and incubated on a platform shaker at 27 °C and 80 rpm for 20 min. The beaker contents were poured into a small Buchner funnel and the tissues were <b>rinsed</b> <b>well</b> with deionized water until no more blue stain was eluted. The tissues were then transferred to 1.5 ml microfuge tubes. One half ml of 1 % aqueous sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) was added in each tube to release the trapped Evans blue from the cells. The tissues were then ground using a pestle-mortar and the homogenates were diluted with 0.5 ml deionized water. The tubes were vortexed and centrifuged at 9000 g for 3 min. 0.8 ml aliquot of the supernatant was removed and optical density was determined spectrophotometrically (UV-VIS Spectrophotometer 2202, Systronics, India) at 600 nm.|$|R

The phase composition of the samples was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (Philips X’pert Multipurpose X-ray Diffraction System with Cu Kα; Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The morphologies of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (Nova Nano SEM 230, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). To measure the electrical property of the films, Au top electrodes were patterned and deposited by sputtering using a metal shadow mask. Voltage–current curves of the films were measured using an Autolab 302 N electrochemical workstation controlled with Nova software (with a possible error in current and voltage values as ± 5 %; Nova Software, Chongqing, China). All measurements were repeated at least twice to confirm the results. During measurement, the working electrode and sensor electrode were connected to the top Au electrode, and the reference and counter electrode were connected to the ITO substrate.|$|R
40|$|Extracts of the growths {{experimentally}} induced {{in domestic}} rabbits with the papilloma virus often contain something that neutralizes or "inhibits" the virus when mixed {{with it in}} vitro, as Shope first noted (1).

General Method To test for inhibitor, the virus-induced papillomas were washed with soap and <b>rinsed</b> <b>well</b> with tap water to remove any adherent blood or virus and were then removed from the animal, using aseptic technique. The connective tissue was carefully trimmed away {{from the base of the}} growths and these were cut into small pieces and washed in isotonic saline to remove any adherent blood.

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{evaluation}} of the electro-chemical potential of various cations, we have recently measured the in vivo pH along the intestinal tract of the laying hen (Hurwitz et al., 1968). The intra-luminal pH was found to increase with the distance from the pylorus, in agreement with mea-surements made on various animals (Tyler, 1946; Smith, 1962; Alexander, 1965). Thus, it was of interest to see if the intesti-nal pH was physiologically regulated or whether it was merely the sum of the acid base balance of the intestinal digesta, as they move along the intestine. Wilson and Kazyak (1957) introduced bicarbonate buffer into rat intestinal sacs in situ, and found that after 30 minutes the pH in-creased in the ileum and decreased in the jejunum. Waldron-Edward et al. (1966) introduced several buffers into various intestinal segments of rat intestine in situ. With saline solution of pH 5. 55 typical pH's of the various intestinal segments were ob-served after 30 minutes of incubation. In these experiments, however, ligated sacs were incubated and no attempt was made to evaluate the time course of the changes in the intestinal pH. In order to measure the regulation ca-pacity of the pH in situ, perfusions of lay-ing hen-intestine with saline solutions were carried out.
