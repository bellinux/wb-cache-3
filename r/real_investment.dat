5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor <b>real</b> <b>investment</b> will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low.

25|$|Ignoring tax, someone {{wishing to}} work for a year and then relax for a year on the same living {{standard}} needs to save 50% of pay. Similarly, someone wishing to work from age 25 to 55 and be retired for 30 years till 85 needs to save 50% of pay if government and employment pensions are not a factor and if it is considered appropriate to assume a zero <b>real</b> <b>investment</b> return. The problem that the lifespan is not known in advance can be reduced in some countries by the purchase at retirement of an inflation-indexed life annuity.|$|E
25|$|After {{expenses}} and any taxes, a reasonable (though arguably pessimistic) long-term assumption {{for a safe}} real rate of return is zero. So in real terms, interest does not help the savings grow. Each year of work must pay its share of a year of retirement. For someone planning to work for 40 years and be retired for 20 years, each year of work pays for itself and for half a year of retirement. Hence, 33.33% of pay must be saved, and 66.67% can be spent when earned. After 40 years of saving 33.33% of pay, we have accumulated assets of 13.33 years of pay, as in the graph. In the graph to the right, the lines are straight, which is appropriate given the assumption of a zero <b>real</b> <b>investment</b> return.|$|E
