5000|$|<b>Retosiban</b> {{also known}} as GSK-221,149-A is an oral drug which acts as a {{oxytocin}} receptor antagonist. It is being developed by GlaxoSmithKline {{for the treatment of}} preterm labour. <b>Retosiban</b> has high affinity for the oxytocin receptor (Ki = 0.65 nM) and has greater than 1400-fold selectivity over the related vasopressin receptors ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Retosiban</b> {{has been}} shown to be an {{effective}} tocolytic. By intravenous and oral administration it produces a dose-dependent decrease in oxytocin-induced uterine contractions in non-pregnant female rats. In late-term pregnant rats it significantly reduces spontaneous uterine contractions in a dose-dependent manner by intravenous administration.In humans <b>retosiban</b> prolongs pregnancy and reduces preterm birth. Intravenous administration of <b>retosiban</b> in women with spontaneous preterm labour was associated with a greater than 1-week increase in time to delivery compared with placebo, a significant reduction in preterm deliveries, a non-significant increase in uterine quiescence, and a favourable safety profile. The results demonstrate proof-of-concept in the treatment of threatened spontaneous preterm labour ...|$|E

5000|$|At {{physiological}} pH, <b>retosiban</b> {{exists in}} an uncharged state. It has good solubility (> 0.22 mg/ml), with a logd of 2.2. <b>Retosiban</b> {{consists of a}} central 2,5 diketopiperazine ring with an R-indanyl group at the 3 position and an R (S-secButyl) at the 6 position, both cis to each other, and with a R-2-methyl oxazole ring at the 7 position in the acyclic amide attached to the N1-position. <b>Retosiban</b> is the (3R, 6R, 7R)-isomer and is a sub-nanomolar (Ki = 0.65 nM) oxytocin receptor antagonist, while the (3R, 6R, 7S)-isomer where the stereochemistry in the amide side-chain at C-7 is inverted, is 10-fold less potent. Typically in this series of 2,5 diketopiperazine oxytocin antagonists the (3S, 6S, 7S) isomer is >500 less active than the (3R, 6R, 7R)-isomer. In addition to the 2,5 diketopiperazine essential core, <b>retosiban</b> also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An indanyl group at position 3 is the best choice in terms of oxytocin receptor antagonist potency, its replacement by phenethyl and benzyl groups led to a progressive weakening of activity. At C-3, a 4-carbon branched alkyl was shown to be preferred with R (S-secButyl) being the best; smaller alkyl groups result in reduced antagonist activity. [...] The 2-methyl oxazole ring at the 7 position gives good aqueous solubility, low protein binding and minimal Cyp450 interaction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Retosiban</b> is a cyclic {{dipeptide}} or 2,5-diketopiperazine {{and these}} are formed by cyclising the corresponding linear dipeptide. In the short and highly stereoselective synthesis of <b>Retosiban</b> 8 the linear peptide 5 is formed by the four-component Ugi reaction of the carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected R-indanylglycine 1, D-alloisoleucine methyl ester hydrochloride 2, 2-methyloxazole-4-carboxaldehyde 3 and 2-benzyloxyphenylisonitrile 4. Hydrogenation to remove the Cbz and benzyl protecting groups, enabled cyclization of the linear peptide 5 to occur to give the phenolic cyclic dipeptide 6. Hydrolysis of the phenolic amide, by reaction with carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), followed addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid gave the acid 7 which was converted to the amide <b>Retosiban</b> 8 by activating the acid with the peptide coupling reagent PyBOP (benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate) followed {{by the addition of}} morpholine.Although the linear peptide 5 and the cyclic dipeptide 6 are a mixture of diastereoisomers (7RS) at the exocyclic amide, the hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of the activated phenolic amide caused epimerisation at the exocyclic position and yielded the acid 7 with the required (7R)-stereochemistry as the major product.|$|E
50|$|<b>Retosiban</b> is a {{competitive}} oxytocin receptor antagonist which blocks the oxytocin-mediated contraction of the uterine smooth muscle {{in the female}} uterus that occurs during the initiation of preterm labour. This {{has been used to}} prevent preterm labour and premature birth.|$|E
50|$|The oral {{bioavailability}} of <b>retosiban</b> is in {{the order}} of 100% in the rat with a half life of 1.4 hours. It has low to moderate intrinsic clearance in microsomes from three pre-clinical species (rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey) and low intrinsic clearance in human microsomes. It has a good cytochrome P450 (Cyp450) profile with no significant inhibition, with IC50 > 100μM, low protein binding (<80%) and low predicted CNS penetration.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} bioactive molecules containing the 2,5-DKP core template {{in the literature}} arising from natural products and available from combinatorial libraries. These small, conformationally rigid, chiral templates have multiple H-bond acceptor and donor functionality and have multiple sites for structural elaboration of diverse functional groups with defined stereochemistry. These characteristics not only enable them to bind with high affinity to a large variety of receptors, showing {{a broad range of}} biological activities, but also allow the development of the drug-like physicochemical properties required for the multiobjective optimization process of transforming a lead to a drug product. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) has been explored for many of these 2,5-DKP templates, and several have been developed into clinical drugs. These include tadalafil a PDE5 inhibitor for erectile dysfunction, <b>retosiban</b> a oxytocin antagonist for preterm labor, aplaviroc a CCR5 antagonists for HIV and epelsiban a oxytocin antagonist for premature ejaculation and the experimental cancer drug plinabulin (NPI-2358/KPU-2) that is active in multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cell lines.|$|E
40|$|Oxytocin, {{a hormone}} {{involved}} in numerous physiologic processes, plays {{a central role}} in the mechanisms of parturition and lactation. It acts through its receptor, which belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, while Gq/phospholipase C (PLC) /inositol 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate (InsP 3) is the main pathway via which it exerts its action in the myometrium. Changes in receptor levels, receptor desensitization, and locally produced oxytocin are factors that influence the effect of oxytocin on uterine contractility in labor. Activation of oxytocin receptor causes myometrial contractions by increasing intracellular Ca+ 2 and production of prostaglandins. Since oxytocin induces contractions, the inhibition of its action has been a target in the management of preterm labor. Atosiban is today the only oxytocin receptor antagonist that is available as a tocolytic. However, the quest for oxytocin receptor antagonists with a better pharmacological profile has led to the synthesis of peptide and nonpeptide molecules such as barusiban, <b>retosiban,</b> L- 368, 899, and SSR- 126768 A. Many of these oxytocin receptor antagonists are used only as pharmacological tools, while others have tocolytic action. In this paper, we summarize the action of oxytocin and its receptor and we present an overview of the clinical and experimental data of oxytocin antagonists and their tocolytic action...|$|E
