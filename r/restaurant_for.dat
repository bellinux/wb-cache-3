Their father Bill later married Terri O'Hara; their step-brother Eric O'Hara died in 2008 after an accidental fall from an icy roof.|$|E
5|$|On 31 March 2014, Heston Blumenthal {{announced}} he would be closing the <b>restaurant</b> <b>for</b> renovations for 6 months and temporarily relocating it with its entire team to Crown Towers, Melbourne, Australia. The restaurant will be called The Fat Duck for 6 months before being renamed Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. This will be the second restaurant with that name and will be Blumenthal's first restaurant outside of Britain, and his sixth in total. This temporary closure of the Bray location caused the restaurant to become ineligible for assessment for the 2016 Michelin Guide, thus losing its 3-starred status which it regained the following year.|$|E
5|$|The private Cloud Club {{formerly}} {{occupied the}} 66th through 68th floors. It opened in July 1930 with some three hundred members, all wealthy males who formed the city's elite. Its creation was spurred by Texaco's wish {{for a proper}} <b>restaurant</b> <b>for</b> its executives prior to renting fourteen floors in the building. The Cloud Club was a compromise between William van Alen's modern style and Walter Chrysler's stately and traditional tastes. A member had to be elected, and if accepted, paid an initial fee of $200, plus a $150 to $300 annual fee.|$|E

5|$|After a hotel {{housing the}} {{remaining}} foreign nationals was attacked, Penfold organised a further evacuation, which {{was conducted by}} an American warship. The ship transported the evacuees—including Penfold—to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. While in Conakry, Penfold advised Kabbah on re-establishing his government in exile, and leased a disused <b>restaurant</b> <b>for</b> the government's headquarters. Kabbah was restored in February 1998, but {{the role of the}} private military company Sandline International in assisting Kabbah created controversy in the United Kingdom, as its services were alleged to violate an arms embargo on Sierra Leone. After an HM Customs investigation, a parliamentary inquiry, and a select committee investigation, Penfold was reprimanded but allowed to return to his post. Later in the year, violence began to intensify again in Sierra Leone, and Penfold was ordered to evacuate foreign nationals (the eight evacuation of his career and the second in Sierra Leone) over Christmas 1998. He requested an extension to his term as high commissioner, but the request was denied and he left Sierra Leone in April 2000. He spent {{the last year of his}} career working for the Department for International Development and retired in 2001. In retirement, Penfold has spoken on issues concerning Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, and has been critical of the FCO. His support of Kabbah, and his role in returning him to power in 1998, earned Penfold folk hero status in Sierra Leone.|$|E
5|$|Mick {{encounters}} two vampires who {{are looking}} for Coraline. Once they leave, Mick visits his vampire friend Josef, who tells him that one of them was Lance (Jason Butler Harner), a rich and powerful vampire. Mick finds Coraline at a storage facility working on a compound for the vampire cure. Coraline explains that during the French Revolution there were seven siblings of royal blood who were vampires, two of whom were Lance and Coraline. She then uses the compound to cure Mick's vampirism, although Lance arrives and takes her away. Mick enjoys life as a human, although the cure is only temporary. Beth's boss at BuzzWire is killed, and a new assistant district attorney named Benjamin Talbot (Eric Winter) investigates the murder. Mick and Beth discuss the problems of having a romantic relationship, and although they end up kissing, Mick tells her he needs time to figure things out. Photos of Mick getting hit by a vehicle find their way into the hands of Talbot. Mick and Beth decide to start a romantic relationship, and go to a <b>restaurant</b> <b>for</b> their first date. When Beth quits her job at BuzzWire and becomes unemployed, Talbot offers her a job as a civilian investigator. Talbot receives a list of names of all the vampires in the area, including Mick, from an unknown source. Beth tells Mick that she cannot continue to date him because of their vampire-human situation, but Mick says that he loves her and they kiss.|$|E

25|$|Wildwood has {{an unusually}} large number of liquor {{licenses}} for its population. State law normally provides for one consumption license (i.e., for a bar, <b>restaurant)</b> <b>for</b> every 3,000 residents, and one distribution license (i.e., for a liquor store) for every 7500 residents. Because of a state law allowing a municipality to grandfather in liquor licenses that existed before 1948, Wildwood has a permanent population of 5,300, but has 61 active liquor licenses.|$|E
25|$|With {{more than}} 170 restaurants, {{there is a}} <b>restaurant</b> <b>for</b> every 79 Addison residents.

Addison has 22 hotels, featuring a total of at least 4,000 hotel rooms and meeting facilities. According to a 2016 Fundera study, Addison ranked the 2nd best place in Texas to start a small business.|$|E
25|$|After {{the crowd}} learned that Loper had {{arranged}} the suspects' transfer, {{they went to}} his <b>restaurant</b> <b>for</b> revenge. The sheriff sent about ten cavalry to the site but forbade them to fire. The mob destroyed Loper's restaurant, its interior, furnishings, and overturned and burned his automobile. An 18-year-old immigrant worker from Eastern Europe was fatally shot in the basement, the first casualty of the riot. Loper managed to escape the crowd. Governor Charles S. Deneen activated the state militia when he realized local authorities were overwhelmed.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of February 2015, {{it was reported that}} Fremantle Volunteer Sea Rescue would likely become based in the signal station. This drew criticism from members of the Cantonment Hill Working Group who had developed the master plan for the site which the City of Fremantle had previously given assurances to implement. In late March 2015 draft plans were presented at a council meeting detailing the creation of a convention center and <b>restaurant</b> <b>for</b> the site, with the FSR suggested as being a medium-term occupant while this larger plan came to fruition.|$|E

25|$|Before he {{directed}} the episode, director Chris Hardwell spent five {{weeks on the}} Numb3rs set watching {{the cast and crew}} film the series.

Several scenes were shot at Caltech, including one near the Beckham Auditorium and one at an outdoor <b>restaurant.</b> <b>For</b> the final scene, Hardwell used a crane shot on the Numb3rs sound stage.|$|E
25|$|Jews {{had lived}} in Košice since the 16th century but {{were not allowed to}} settle permanently.
