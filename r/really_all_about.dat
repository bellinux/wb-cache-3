500|$|Jackson {{spoke with}} Larry King on CNN, {{supporting}} the It Gets Better Project and The Trevor Project, {{a non-profit organization}} providing crisis and suicide prevention for LGBT youth, {{in light of the}} high profile suicides committed in Fall, 2010. She stated: [...] "(I was) one of those kids... holding everything inside... internalizing everything. And that really can affect you, and feeling helpless and hopeless, and finding that person that you can trust, that adult, like I did later on in life, that I felt comfortable and safe to tell my issues, my worries, my pains, my aches to. This is what the Trevor Project is <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> And they have a 24-hour hotline... There's someone there that you can speak with 24 hours that will be there for you." [...] She made an official It Gets Better video which was released on December 1, 2010.|$|E
500|$|... "Catholic Girls" [...] is {{critical}} of the Catholic Church, and satirizes [...] "the hypocrisy of {{the myth of the}} good Catholic girl." [...] While Zappa was in favor of the sexual revolution, he regarded himself as a pioneer in publicly discussing honesty about sexual intercourse, stating [...] "American sexual attitudes are controlled as a necessary tool of business and government in order to perpetuate themselves. Unless people begin to see through that, to see past it to, what sex is <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about,</b> they're always going to have the same neurotic attitudes. It's very neatly packaged. It all works hand-in-hand with the churches and political leaders at the point, where elections are coming up." [...] This view inspired the lyrical content of [...] "Crew Slut", in which Mary, Joe's girlfriend, falls into the groupie lifestyle, going on to participate in a wet T-shirt contest in the following track, [...] "Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt" ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul Williams {{acknowledges}} Gethin's {{suggestion of}} the [...] "principle of the equivalence of cosmology and psychology," [...] but notes that Gethin is not asserting the Buddhist cosmology is <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> current or potential {{states of mind}} or psychology. The realms in Buddhist cosmology are indeed realms of rebirths. Otherwise rebirth would always be into the human realm, or {{there would be no}} rebirth at all. And that is not traditional Buddhism, states Williams.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{so little}} of one! One would <b>really</b> forget <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it if you wretched Americans were not {{constantly}} reminding one. However, I do think of giving it up, the little there is left of it, one of these days." ...|$|R

[...] "I promised {{to go to}} a club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I <b>really</b> forgot <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it. We were to have played a duet together--three duets, I believe. I don't know what she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a Variety {{magazine}} interview, Julie Hanan Carruthers, {{executive producer}} of the show, spoke of Bianca's character development. She gave insight into the [...] "heart" [...] of the story. [...] "It was so successful," [...] she said. [...] "We did not tell a story about a lesbian. We told a story about a young girl coming out and her life around it. That was a big lesson to all of us here. It's <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the story. If you can make people care on a human level, it's not sexual preference. It's about the human experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jaya {{released}} an album under Universal Records entitled All Souled Out, a CD album containing 12 tracks of all revival songs. It was her third cover album, containing classic R and jazz songs that {{she grew up}} listening to. The album received a critical response, after experimenting {{with a variety of}} sounds in her previous outings, [...] "Jaya comes to terms with what she is <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> as a singer in [...] "All Souled Out." [...] She triumphs in making the material sound genuine, largely because it is perfect for her. And her voice is a thing of wonder. There is warmth, power, and vulnerability in her renditions, making listening to the entire album a breeze—perfect for long drives or for those lazy weekends." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1996 movie That Thing You Do! touches {{briefly on}} the phenomenon, with the Wonders making an {{appearance}} in a fictional beach party movie, Weekend at Party Pier. A 2001 episode of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch ("Beach Blanket Bizarro") also paid {{homage to the}} series, with Avalon appearing as himself. Avalon and Funicello starred in Paramount Pictures Back to the Beach in 1987, playing off their original roles and subsequent careers. Kelly Killoren Bensimon wrote in The Bikini Book, [...] "It was <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Annette Funicello. If {{the girl next door}} wanted to wear a bikini, then everybody wanted to wear a bikini. We didn't want to be a bad Bond girl. We all really wanted to be the good girl." ...|$|E

5000|$|Guggenheim's 2010 {{documentary}} Waiting for [...] "Superman", a {{film about}} the failures of American public education sparked controversy and debate. Guggenheim knew his film would lead to this and said, [...] "I know people will say this movie is anti-this or pro-that. But it <b>really</b> is <b>all</b> <b>about</b> families trying to find great schools". This film received the Audience Award for best documentary at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Its public release was in September 2010.|$|R
6000|$|Marco seemed really {{disappointed}} {{at having}} lost {{the opportunity to}} make his full confession, but Forester told him that he considered that he had made full confession. [...] "You made up your mind to do it," [...] said he, [...] "and you did begin, and it was the beginning which required all the effort. I only refrained from asking you about the details, from a wish to show you that I <b>really</b> knew <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{there is}} another type of vessel that trades with the [...] "Lively Poll" [...] and other ships of that fishing fleet--the Dutch [...] "coper", {{bringing}} goods to trade for fish, including tobacco and schnapps, for the Demon Drink is the ruination of many a good man. That is what this book is <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about,</b> the ruination of some men, and the salvation of others, for even out at sea there are missionaries working to try and save souls.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} to have a moral under all its gaiety," [...] assented Syme; [...] "but may I ask you two questions? You need not fear to give me information, because, as you remember, you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the police, a promise I shall {{certainly}} keep. So it is in mere curiosity that I make my queries. First of all, what is it <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about?</b> What is it you object to? You want to abolish Government?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She had a {{very pretty}} way of saying Timothy, so David and I went into another room to leave her alone with the {{manuscript}} of this poor little book, and when we returned she had the greatest surprise of the day for me. She was both laughing and crying, which was no surprise, {{for all of us}} would laugh and cry over a book about such an interesting subject as ourselves, but said she, [...] "How wrong you are in thinking this book is about me and mine, it is <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Timothy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] agreed Miss Kavanagh's host, with {{a feeble}} pretence {{that the subject}} {{had been on the}} tip of his tongue. As a matter of fact, he <b>really</b> had {{forgotten}} <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it. [...] "We might have it up here while the room is being got ready. Perhaps a little--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, John Spencer," [...] said Mrs. Hill carelessly. [...] "He's at {{the head}} of the Land Office here. That's <b>really</b> <b>all</b> I know <b>about</b> him. Jack says he is a downright good fellow and all that, you know. But he's no earthly good in a social way; he can't talk or he won't. He's flat. So {{different}} from Mr. Madison, isn't he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you. Though I might {{remind you}} that {{it is the first time}} I have ever seen him. Sit down." [...] He waved her to a stool, himself taking the bench. [...] "I'm <b>really</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> in, you know. There's no turnpike from the Yukon here." ...|$|R

5|$|We love, obviously, to do provocative imagery... {{we always}} try to {{definitely}} push the limits... I think because, in the end, it's not <b>really</b> at <b>all</b> <b>about</b> domestic violence. It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|R

40|$|Symbol Grounding has {{originated}} {{in the domain of}} cognitive connectionism as an approach to a model of language acquisition. It has, however, transcended this restricted domain and its most prominent proponents now regard it as a technique which is of general importance to the connectionist-symbolic debate, especially for their integration into a common framework. This paper revisits the claims made by symbol grounders and summarizes different models which have been presented to date. We try to answer the question what Symbol Grounding <b>really</b> is <b>all</b> <b>about</b> and point to its parallels with classical logic and reasoning which have not received sufficient attention so far. 1 The Origin of Symbol Grounding 1. 1 Overview This paper is intended to evaluate recent developments within a specific subarea of symbolicconnectionist integration.
