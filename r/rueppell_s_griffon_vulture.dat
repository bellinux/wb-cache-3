40|$|In East Africa live {{two species}} of Griffon Vultures; Rüppel’s <b>Griffon</b> <b>Vulture</b> (Gyps rueppellii) and African White-backed <b>Griffon</b> <b>Vulture</b> (G. africanus). One of the {{apparently}} most important factors limiting the population of these birds is food supply. <b>Griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> nest for eight months of the year, and are during this period geographically tied down to the nesting place. The living biomass in the East-African protected areas Masai Mara and Serengeti consists mainly of migrating ungulate populations of Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurins), Common Zebra (Equus burchelli), and Thomson’s Gazelle (Gazella thomsoni). The migration of these ungulates causes an irregular and unsure food supply for the <b>Griffon</b> <b>vultures.</b> In order to cope with this, <b>Griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> have developed anatomic, physiologic and ethologic characteristics. <b>Griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> have the advantages of being large and diurnal as well as good sight. Long necks and flat feet are adaptations for an easier opening of carcasses and spending {{long periods of time}} on the ground. <b>Griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> also elicit social traits such as local enhancement that benefit the whole population, nest in colonies that give protection, and are in principle monogamous which saves energy. A lot of energy is consumed by raising offspring, but this is well-invested time as the number of successful reproductions and nestlings that reach adulthood is high.

5000|$|The Pyrenees {{population}} has apparently {{been affected by}} an EC ruling that due to danger of BSE transmission, no carcasses must be left on the fields for the time being. This has critically lowered food availability, and consequently, carrying capacity. Although the <b>griffon</b> <b>vulture</b> does not normally attack larger living prey, {{there are reports of}} Spanish <b>griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> killing weak, young or unhealthy living animals as they do not find enough carrion to eat. In May 2013, a 52-year-old woman who was hiking in the Pyrenees and had fallen off a cliff to her death was eaten by <b>griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> before rescue workers were able to recover her body, leaving only her clothes and a few of her bones. Due to her being the first human to be documented being eaten by <b>griffon</b> <b>vultures,</b> the story brought worldwide attention to the <b>griffon</b> <b>vulture</b> problems in Southern Europe.|$|R
50|$|The <b>griffon</b> <b>vulture</b> (Gyps fulvus) {{is a large}} Old World vulture in {{the bird}} of prey family Accipitridae. It {{is also known as}} the Eurasian griffon. It is not to be {{confused}} with a different species, Rüppell's <b>griffon</b> <b>vulture</b> (Gyps rueppellii).|$|R
50|$|As large scavengers, <b>griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> {{have not}} been {{observed}} to seek shelter for thermoregulation. Vultures use their bald heads {{as a means to}} thermoregulate in both extreme cold and hot temperatures. Changes in posture can increase bare skin exposure from 7% to 32%. This change allows for the more than doubling of convective heat loss in still air. <b>Griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> have also been found to tolerate increased body temperatures as a response to high ambient temperatures. By allowing their internal body temperature to change independently of their metabolic rate, <b>griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> minimize their loss of water and energy in thermoregulating. One study in particular (Bahat 1995) found that these adaptations have allowed the <b>Griffon</b> <b>vulture</b> to have one of the widest thermal neutral zones of any bird.|$|R

50|$|<b>Griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> {{have been}} used as model organisms for the study of soaring and thermoregulation. The energy costs of level flight tend to be high, {{prompting}} alternatives to flapping in larger birds. Vultures in particular utilize more efficient flying methods such as soaring. Compared to other birds, which elevate their metabolic rate to upwards of 16 times their basal metabolic rate in flight, soaring <b>griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> expend about 1.43 times their basal metabolic rate in flight. <b>Griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> are also efficient flyers in their ability to return to a resting heart rate after flight within ten minutes.|$|R

40|$|Background: Wind farms {{have shown}} a {{spectacular}} growth during the last 15 years. Avian mortality through collision with moving rotor blades is well-known {{as one of the}} main adverse impacts of wind farms. In Spain, the <b>griffon</b> <b>vulture</b> incurs the highest mortality rates in wind farms. Methodology/Principal Findings: As far as we know, this study is the first attempt to predict flight trajectories of birds in order to foresee potentially dangerous areas for wind farm development. We analyse topography and wind flows in relation to flight paths of <b>griffon</b> <b>vultures,</b> using a scaled model of the wind farm area in an aerodynamic wind tunnel, and test the difference between the observed flight paths of <b>griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> and the predominant wind flows. Different wind currents for each wind direction in the aerodynamic model were observed. Simulations of wind flows in a wind tunnel were compared with observed flight paths of <b>griffon</b> <b>vultures.</b> No statistical differences were detected between the observed flight trajectories of <b>griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> and the wind passages observed in our wind tunnel model. A significant correlation was found between dead vultures predicted proportion of vultures crossing those cells according to the aerodynamic model. Conclusions: <b>Griffon</b> <b>vulture</b> flight routes matched the predominant wind flows in the area (i. e. they followed the routes where less flight effort was needed). We suggest using these kinds of simulations to predict flight paths over complex terrains can inform the location of wind turbines and thereby reduce soaring bird mortality. Â© 2012 de Lucas et al.

From 2013 to 2015, we studied the moult patterns of 1077 wild <b>Griffon</b> <b>Vultures</b> in Catalonia, examining the age of their feathers and testing if they moulted on demand. The moulting period lasted from April to December, ending in winter for adults and it was continuous for immatures, although it was less active in winter. Griffons needed five calendar years to become adults, but once adults; they could replace all their flight feathers in 2 years. First calendar year <b>Griffon</b> <b>Vultures</b> did not moult any feather until April of their following year. Second calendar year vultures demonstrated a stepwise moult (with several moult waves) on primary feathers. Adults showed higher intensity and higher randomness, despite they also showed a stepwise moult on primaries. On secondaries, subadults showed different moult focus. They did not show a clear moult on demand despite few of them shown alterated moults with feathers moulted around a cut feather, not following the moult wave. Adults did not show a consistent moult pattern but we think they may follow a moulting cycle alternating 5 th calendar years and 6 th calendar years patterns but possibly with some delays due to nutrition problems on their lives and some other alterations like loss of feathers on the battles they have when they are eating on carcasses; this could explain the asymmetry that Zuberogoitia (2013) has found on <b>Griffon</b> <b>Vultures</b> moults, and why some feathers have more probability to be moulted despite we found that moult on demand does not seem to occur in wild <b>Griffon</b> <b>Vultures...</b>|$|R
