40|$|Abstract—Overhaul {{and repair}} {{services}} are important {{segments of the}} remanufacturing industry, and are characterized by complicated disassembly, repair and assembly process plans, stochastic operations, and the usage of <b>rotable</b> inventory. In view of today’s time-based competition, effectively scheduling such services and managing <b>rotable</b> inventory and uncertainties are becoming imperative to achieve on-time deliveries and low overall costs. In this paper, a novel formulation for overhaul and repair services is presented where key characteristics, such as uncertain asset arrivals and operation processing times, and <b>rotable</b> parts are abstracted to model an overhaul center and multiple repair shops in a distributed framework to reflect organizational structures. Interactions between the overhaul center and repair shops are described by sets of coupling constraints across the organizations. <b>Rotable</b> inventory dynamics is formulated in terms of repair operation completio...|$|E

Using the values obtained for dye concentration absorbed in fibre were established the optimum working parameters for dying process with dye extracted from green walnuts husks. In this program were included two successive directions: the programming of the experiments and experimental dates analyse. Active method of elaboration of empirical models involves obtaining experimental data {{as a result of}} controlled experiments (planned). If you give up the classic experimental program in favor of an active experimental program, dependent variable description (optimization parameter) presents a series of advantages, namely: considerable simplification of calculations, decrease the number of experiments, shortened research works and the consumption of raw materials, increasing the accuracy of determination of the regression equation coefficients. In order for the research to present economic efficiency and to be carried out in a timely manner, it is necessary that the experimental part contains a minimum volume of determinations.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{an optimal}} inventory model for repairable and long leadtime spare parts for an Engine overhaul business. In addition, {{it presents a}} business case for centralization of inventory. Pratt & Whitney purchased the Norway Engine Center (NEC) in 2000. Two new engine centers, the Shanghai Engine Center (SEC) and the Turkey Engine Center (TEC) opened as joint ventures in 2009. While all three engine centers overhaul the same engine, they each make independent decisions regarding material strategy. Operations are expected to grow substantially at the two newest centers. Current inventory practices are not sustainable as operations expand. In addition, the overhaul business is a competitive market and there is growing pressure to decrease engine turn-around-time (TAT). An optimal material strategy is needed to reduce the material sourcing time and therefore reduce overall TAT. This project develops an inventory strategy that will significantly reduce TAT with minimal additional inventory investment. To accomplish this, an inventory model was developed to determine the optimal inventory level and then using this model, the business case for using centralization to reduce both holding cost and material sourcing time was investigated. All inventory in the engine centers were considered in this project, however <b>rotable</b> material {{became the focus of}} this research as it has the largest impact on the engine center through its high value and long lead-times. <b>Rotable</b> material is inventory used to buffer against the lead-time of parts out for repair. In the engine overhaul business material sourcing time is built into the process. This means that material is not needed immediately but rather after some specified amount of time. This feature is central to the <b>rotable</b> inventory model. The model determines the mean and variance of the excess lead-time - the portion of the lead-time that occurs after the specified time allotted. The excess lead-time is used to determine the optimal reorder point. Using this model, we show that centralization of <b>rotable</b> material will reduce inventory value by more than 30 % over the current decentralized system both using the current TAT as well as the proposed TAT. by Tyeliah Elaine Duncan.

40|$|Analysis {{of the use}} of ICT in the {{aerospace}} industry has prompted the detailed investigation of an inventory-planning problem. There is a special class of inventory, consisting of expensive repairable spares for use in support of aircraft operations. These items, called rotables, are not well served by conventional theory and systems for inventory management. The context of the problem, the aircraft maintenance industry sector, is described in order to convey some of its special characteristics in the context of operations management. A literature review is carried out to seek existing theory that can be applied to <b>rotable</b> inventory and to identify a potential gap into which newly developed theory could contribute. Current techniques for <b>rotable</b> planning are identified in industry and the literature: these methods are modelled and tested using inventory and operational data obtained in the field. In the expectation that current practice leaves much scope for improvement, several new models are proposed. These are developed and tested on the field data for comparison with current practice. The new models are revised following testing to give improved versions. The best model developed and tested here comprises a linear programming optimisation, which finds an optimal level of inventory for multiple test cases, reflecting changing operating conditions. The new model offers an inventory plan that is up to 40 % less expensive than that determined by current practice, while maintaining required performance...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} planning preventive maintenance and overhaul for modules {{that are used in}} a fleet of assets such as trains or airplanes. Each type of module, or <b>rotable,</b> has its own maintenance program in which a maximum amount of time/usage between overhauls of a module is stipulated.

The problem we study is to determine aggregate workforce levels, turn-around stock levels of modules, and overhaul and replacement quantities per period so as to minimize the sum of labor costs, material costs of overhaul, and turn-around stock investments over the entire life-cycle of the maintained asset. We prove that this planning problem is strongly NP -hard, but we also provide computational evidence that the mixed integer programming formulation can be solved within reasonable time for real-life instances.

40|$|Maintenance is {{constantly}} challenged with increasing productivity by maximizing up-time and reliability {{while at the}} same time reducing expenditure and investment. In the last few years it has become evident through the development of maintenance concepts that maintenance is more than just a non-productive support function, it is a profit- generating function. In the past decades, hundreds of models that address maintenance strategy have been presented. The vast majority of those models rely purely on mathematical modeling to describe the maintenance function. Due to the complex nature of the maintenance function, and its complex interaction with other functions, it is almost impossible to accurately model maintenance using mathematical modeling without sacrificing accuracy and validity with unfeasible simplifications and assumptions. Analysis presented as part of this thesis shows that stochastic simulation offers a viable alternative and a powerful technique for tackling maintenance problems. Stochastic simulation is a method of modeling a system or process (on a computer) based on random events generated by the software so that system performance can be evaluated without experimenting or interfering with the actual system. The methodology developed as part of this thesis addresses most of the shortcomings found in literature, specifically by allowing the modeling of most of the complexities of an advanced maintenance system, such as one that is employed in the airline industry. This technique also allows sensitivity analysis to be carried out resulting in an understanding of how critical variables may affect the maintenance and asset management decision-making process. In many heavy industries (e. g. airline maintenance) where high utilization is essential for the success of the organization, subsystems are often of a <b>rotable</b> nature, i. e. they rotate among different systems throughout their life-cycle. This causes a system to be composed of a number of subsystems of different ages, and therefore different reliability characteristics. This makes it difficult for analysts to estimate its reliability behavior, and therefore may result in a less-than-optimal maintenance plan. Traditional reliability models are based on detailed statistical analysis of individual component failures. For complex machinery, especially involving many <b>rotable</b> parts, such analyses are difficult and time consuming. In this work, a model is proposed that combines the well-established Weibull method with discrete simulation to estimate the reliability of complex machinery with <b>rotable</b> subsystems or modules. Each module is characterized by an empirically derived failure distribution. The simulation model consists of a number of stages including operational up-time, maintenance down-time and a user-interface allowing decisions on maintenance and replacement strategies as well as inventory levels and logistics. This enables the optimization of a maintenance plan by comparing different maintenance and removal policies using the Cost per Unit Time (CPUT) measure as the decision variable. Five different removal strategies were tested. These include: On-failure replacements, block replacements, time-based replacements, condition-based replacements and a combination of time-based and condition-based strategies. Initial analyses performed on aircraft gas-turbine data yielded an optimal combination of modules out of a pool of multiple spares, resulting in an increased machine up-time of 16 %. In addition, it was shown that condition-based replacement is a cost-effective strategy; however, it was noted that the combination of time and condition-based strategy can produce slightly better results. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed to optimize decision variables (module soft-time), and to provide an insight to the level of accuracy with which it has to be estimated. It is imperative as part of the overall reliability and life-cycle cost program to focus not only on reducing levels of unplanned (i. e. breakdown) maintenance through preventive and predictive maintenance tasks, but also optimizing inventory of spare parts management, sometimes called float hardware. It is well known that the unavailability of a spare part may result in loss of revenue, which is associated with an increase in system downtime. On the other hand increasing the number of spares will lead to an increase in capital investment and holding cost. The results obtained from the simulation model were used in a discounted NPV (Net Present Value) analysis to determine the optimal number of spare engines. The benefits of this methodology are that it is capable of providing reliability trends and forecasts in a short time frame and based on available data. In addition, it takes into account the <b>rotable</b> nature of many components by tracking the life and service history of individual parts and allowing the user to simulate different combinations of rotables, operating scenarios, and replacement strategies. It is also capable of optimizing stock and spares levels as well as other related key parameters like the average waiting time, unavailability cost, and the number of maintenance events that result in extensive durations due to the unavailability of spare parts. Importantly, as more data becomes available or as greater accuracy is demanded, the model or database can be updated or expanded, thereby approaching the results obtainable by pure statistical reliability analysis...|$|E

Millions of dollars can be saved annually by following the metamodel recommendations for changes and reductions in inventories, {{while at the same time}} maximizing F/A- 18 squadron operational availability. Managers and leaders in the naval aviation and supply communities should use the metamodel as a tool to modify F 404 engine module inventory allowance requirements. The metamodel is valid and provides a real means to address the problem of optimizing module inventory levels with operational availability that before would have been overwhelming and impossible to tackle fully. With the power of today's personal computers, combined with sophisticated simulation programs, simulating the F 404 engine module repair process at the afloat Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) level is accomplishable. The simulation model is developed from real maintenance and usage data and provides a detailed and accurate representation of the repair process.

The Optimized Potential for Liquid Simulations (OPLS) all atom force field (Jorgensen et al., 1996) is uniformly utilized within the Q-MOL program.

The docking site was prepared {{as an area}} encompassing both the ligand binding pocket and the peptide cofactor binding site. The protein molecule preparation included adding of hydrogen atoms and the assignment of the standard OPLS atom types.

The ligands were docked into the grid-based potentials using the Monte Carlo simulation in the internal coordinate space as implemented in the Q-MOL program. The preparation of each ligand for docking simulation initially included an automatic OPLS atom type assignment and conversion of the 2 D sketch-like models (input as the MDL MOL format) into the 3 D molecular models. The full-atom ligand structure was then minimized using the Q-MOL small molecule minimization protocol. The protocol combines minimization in both internal and Cartesian coordinates to properly optimize the <b>rotable</b> bonds of a small molecule. In the course of VLS, the compounds were minimally filtered by applying lower molecular mass cut-off of 220  Da, a polyphenols sub-structure filter, and a filter detecting chlorine atoms attached to aliphatic carbons. Because of the stochastic nature of the Q-MOL docking protocol, each ligand was docked at least three times. The best energy conformers with the lowest binding energy were then selected. To differentiate between the true and false binders, Q-MOL VLS uses a proprietary protein-ligand binding energy evaluation function. This function is based on the re-parameterized OPLS force field, and, in addition to the protein-ligand interactions, it accounts for the internal energy change of the docked ligand. Upon completion of VLS, the hits were ranked by relative binding energy, and the best (lowest) energy hits were then selected. The selected hits were visually inspected and the highly symmetric or heavily halogenated ligands and the high molecular weight compounds were discarded and not analyzed further. Out of 100 predicted hits, only 11 were selected and ordered from NCI DTP for in vitro testing.|$|E
