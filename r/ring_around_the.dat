5|$|The {{subspecies}} of the Australian ringneck differ {{considerably in}} colouration. It is a medium size species around 33cm (11in) long. The basic colour is green, and all four subspecies have the characteristic yellow <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> hindneck; wings and tail are {{a mixture of}} green and blue.|$|E
5|$|These {{are often}} called flukes, as most have flat rhomboid shapes {{like that of}} a {{flounder}} (Old English flóc). There are about 11,000 species, more than all other platyhelminthes combined, and second only to roundworms among parasites on metazoans. Adults usually have two holdfasts, a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> mouth and a larger sucker midway along what would be the underside in a free-living flatworm.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 paper saw {{a return}} to white-eye {{taxonomy}} with the formal description of the Togian white-eye Zosterops somadikartai, an endemic species of the Togian Islands of Indonesia, which, unlike most of its relatives, lacks the white <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> eye which give this group of birds its name. Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of its close relatives.|$|E

5|$|Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings), a {{pathognomonic}} sign, may {{be visible}} in the cornea of the eyes, either directly or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cornea. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither cause significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the flags used by the military, several other flag designs were inspired by the national flag. The former Japan Post flag consisted of the Hinomaru with a red horizontal bar placed {{in the center of}} the flag. There was also a thin white <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> red sun. It was later replaced by a flag that consisted of the 〒 postal mark in red on a white background.|$|E
5|$|In euryarchaea {{the cell}} {{division}} protein FtsZ, which forms a contracting <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cell, and {{the components of}} the septum that is constructed across the center of the cell, are similar to their bacterial equivalents. In cren- and thaumarchaea, however, the cell division machinery Cdv fulfills a similar role. This machinery is related to the eukaryotic ESCRT-III machinery which, while best known for its role in cell sorting, also has been seen to fulfill a role in separation between divided cell, suggesting an ancestral role in cell division.|$|E

5|$|On 12 April, the 14th Panzer Division linked up {{with the}} Italians at Vrbovsko, closing the <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{remnants}} of the 7th Army, which surrendered, and the 1st Mountain Division pushed through Novo Mesto and Črnomelj without facing resistance, reaching Vinice {{by the end of}} the day. At Celje, Lanz received a delegation led by Natlačen which included Andrej Gosar. The meeting was very formal and cold, as Lanz had already received orders regarding the break-up of Slovenia into Italian and German-controlled territories, and the council and its goal of an independent Slovenia were superfluous from a German perspective.|$|E
5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
5|$|The {{coloration}} of the upperparts {{is generally}} uniform, with some scattered darker hairs. There is a yellow <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> eyes, {{which is more}} prominent than in A.sylvanus. The underparts are not strongly demarcated from the upperparts in color and are yellow-brown to gray. There are some scattered white hairs on the chin. Although this white spot is better developed than in A.sylvanus, A.spegazzinii lacks the conspicuous white spot seen in A.simulator. The color of the feet ranges from white and yellow-brown to gray. Ungual tufts of hairs cover the claws; these hairs are grayish-brown at the bases and whitish at the tips. The amount of hair on the tail is variable, but it is dark brown above and white to yellow-brown below. High-altitude animals tend to have hairier ears and tails.|$|E

5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
5|$|The pale brown-skinned ovoid {{tunicate}} bulbs have a membranous {{tunic and}} a corky stem (base or basal) plate from which arise the adventitious root hairs in a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> edge, which {{grow up to}} 40mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud. The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping the flower stalk (semisheathed).(see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units, each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each bulb unit has a life of about four years.|$|E
5|$|A non-tropical frontal low {{developed}} from a cold front on November 1 {{to the west}} of the Azores. It intensified while moving west-northwestward and gradually dissipated its frontal structure. It became a subtropical storm on November 4 about 775 nautical miles (1435km) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Operationally, the storm was considered a non-tropical low, and the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until it became a tropical cyclone. It moved slowly northward as convection organized into a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> center. As a result of a ship reporting hurricane-force winds near the center, and due to the development of a weak mid-level warm core, the subtropical cyclone was reclassified as Hurricane Noel on November 5. Increasing westerly wind shear limited convection near the center, and Noel weakened to a tropical storm early on November 6. Progressively cooler water temperatures contributed to weakening, and Noel became extratropical later on November 6 about 330mi (530km) southeast of Newfoundland. The extratropical remnant continued to the northeast and was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm later that day.|$|E

5|$|On 12 April, the 14th Panzer Division linked up {{with the}} Italians at Vrbovsko, closing the <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{remnants}} of the 7th Army, before thrusting southeast towards Sarajevo. The remaining elements of the 4th Army had organised defences around the towns of Kostajnica, Bosanski Novi, Bihać and Prijedor, but the 14th Panzer Division quickly broke through at Bosanski Novi and captured Banja Luka, and by 14 April it had captured Jajce. In {{the wake of the}} panzers, the 183rd Infantry Division pushed through Zagreb and Sisak to capture Kostajnica and Bosanska Gradiška. On 15 April, the 14th Panzer Division was closing on Sarajevo. The Ustaše arrested the staffs of the 1st Army Group, and 4th and 7th Armies at Petrinja, and the 1st Army Group effectively ceased to exist as a formation. After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav High Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mention of}} rings around Neptune {{dates back to}} 1846 when William Lassell, the {{discoverer}} of Neptune's largest moon, Triton, thought {{he had seen a}} <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> planet. However, his claim was never confirmed and it is likely that it was an observational artifact. The first reliable detection of a ring was made in 1968 by stellar occultation, although that result would go unnoticed until 1977 when the rings of Uranus were discovered. Soon after the Uranus discovery, a team from Villanova University led by Harold J. Reitsema began searching for rings around Neptune. On 24 May 1981, they detected a dip in a star's brightness during one occultation; however, {{the manner in which the}} star dimmed did not suggest a ring. Later, after the Voyager fly-by, it was found that the occultation was due to the small Neptunian moon Larissa, a highly unusual event.|$|E

5|$|The terrain {{south of}} Ioannina {{provided}} excellent defensive ground. Moreover, the Ottoman forces further reinforced their positions with permanent fortifications, constructed {{under the direction}} of the German General Rüdiger von der Goltz. These were equipped with concrete artillery emplacements, bunkers, trenches, barbed wire, searchlights and machine gun positions. The Ioannina fortress area included two major fortresses, those of Bizani and Kastritsa, guarding the main southern approaches, along with five smaller forts in a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> city, covering the western and northwestern approaches. The forts were well supplied with artillery, totaling some 102 pieces (most of them 87mm). By December 1912, both sides were reinforced: the Ottomans received part of the Vardar Army, retreating after the Battle of Monastir, bringing their forces up to some 35,000, while the Greeks also brought up the 2nd Division from Macedonia and a number of volunteer regiments, for a total of 25,000 men. The Greeks launched a first attack on the fortress area on December 14. The Ottomans succeeded in repelling it in a series of actions that lasted until December 22, and even gained some ground, albeit at the cost of high casualties which depleted their numbers to some 26,000 men.|$|E
5|$|While a starfish lacks a {{centralized}} brain, {{it has a}} complex nervous system with a nerve <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> mouth and a radial nerve running along the ambulacral region of each arm parallel to the radial canal. The peripheral nerve system consists of two nerve nets: a sensory system in the epidermis and a motor system in {{the lining of the}} coelomic cavity. Neurons passing through the dermis connect the two. The ring nerves and radial nerves have sensory and motor components and coordinate the starfish's balance and directional systems. The sensory component receives input from the sensory organs while the motor nerves control the tube feet and musculature. The starfish does not have the capacity to plan its actions. If one arm detects an attractive odour, it becomes dominant and temporarily over-rides the other arms to initiate movement towards the prey. The mechanism for this is not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|While passing to {{the south}} of Bermuda, the {{subtropical}} storm maintained winds of 70mph (110km/h), with wind gusts on the island surpassing 100mph (160km/h). After becoming dissociated from the Westerlies, the system turned northward, and began to develop convection over the center. In addition, the frontal characteristics of the subtropical storm continually weakened. On October 13, based on an Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit observation that stated that a warm core was present throughout the system, the National Hurricane Center designated the system as a tropical storm, and gave it the name Karen. At this point, Karen was located 200miles (320km) north of Bermuda. Karen slowly strengthened over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, and the storm intensified to a hurricane later on October 13. Convection continued to develop, and organized into a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> eye as Karen reached its peak intensity of 80mph (130km/h) on October 14 while located about 400miles (640km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia.|$|E
