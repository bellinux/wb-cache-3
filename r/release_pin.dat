The aircraft was carrying nuclear weapons on board {{in the event of}} war with the Soviet Union breaking out. Air Force Captain Bruce Kulka, who was the navigator and bombardier, was summoned to the bomb bay area after the captain of the aircraft, Captain Earl Koehler, had encountered a fault light in the cockpit indicating that the bomb harness locking pin did not engage. As Kulka reached around the bomb to pull himself up, he mistakenly grabbed the emergency <b>release</b> <b>pin.</b> The Mark 6 nuclear bomb dropped {{to the floor of the}} B-47 and the weight forced the bomb bay doors open, sending the bomb [...] down to the ground below.|$|E

50|$|On March 11, 1958 a U.S. Air Force B-47 Stratojet with {{a nuclear}} payload left for nuclear {{training}} exercises for war preparations in the United Kingdom and South Africa. The navigator mistakenly pulled the emergency <b>release</b> <b>pin</b> {{which resulted in the}} bomb falling out of the plane. Although the bomb was not armed with the trigger (a removable capsule of fissionable material which was securely stored in a containment area on board the plane), it nevertheless contained a high-explosive detonator. The resulting explosion created a crater estimated to be 75 ft wide and 25 - 35 feet (7.6 - 10.7 m) deep. It destroyed a local playhouse, near the residence of Walter Gregg, and leveled nearby trees. Nobody was killed by the blast but several people in Gregg's family were injured.|$|E

5000|$|Two leaf-shuttered lenses {{were also}} made available, first the 90mm 2.8 {{and later a}} 165mm 2.8 that both {{allowing}} flash sync at all speeds, thereby solving many mirror and shutter vibration problems as well as allowing for fast shutter speeds for use with strobes and portable flashes while in bright shooting conditions. Lenses {{are linked to the}} body by the operation of the aperture stop-down lever being tripped. The camera body is set to the [...] "time-exposure" [...] setting. The through-the-lens (TTL) metering pentaprism viewfinder and included a knurled shutter dial ring with fitted case. The TTL-metered Pentaprism is the same coverage as the non-metered pentaprism, a coverage of 90% of frame and has a sensitivity pattern of 60% center-weight and 30% inner field sensitivity. The TTL Metering Pentaprism has no internal power of its own, instead, the operating power comes from one of the three contacts found in the finder bay of the body as well as grounding to the body. Only two of the three contacts are utilized and depending on the two modes: Normal as 'AUTO' mode and in an override to stopdown mode in the 'MAN' mode as found on many equipped lenses. In 'AUTO' is where the lens is fully opened and adjustments are read from the coupled index from the lens-through the index ring of the body mount-to the chain and index shuttle, the TTL-Meter receives the position information via a protruding tab facing the finder bay. The tab operates a linear potentiometer. In 'MAN' or manual mode with so equipped lenses, the sliding of the lens switch will move an internal lever that then presses down on the activating switch in the body. The switch is located inside the pin of the lens <b>release</b> <b>pin.</b> This inner pin is connected to an electrical toggle inside the body and switches the current from body grounded to bay connector to activate the secondary circuit. The installation of the TTL-Meter into the finder bay requires first the removal or turning of the lens to remove tension on the aperture chain. When the lens is rotated to allow the index on the chain to properly match up with the tab under the meter, the finder can then be seated and firmly pressed until the locks {{on either side of the}} finder latch. Removal of the finder is the reverse by first removing the lens and then pressing in the locks on the sides of the finder and lifting out. The physical difference of the TTL-Meter to the regular prism is the bulky arm that extends to the shutter speed dial. The dial covers the body dial and is coupled via a spring loaded index to the shutter speed dial. The included knurled ring assists the reach of the shutter speed dial due to the bulk of the TTL-Meter prism. The stop-down mode or direct metering through while the aperture is allowed to operate and change the amount of light, is similar to the 'MAN' mode, but activates when a non-auto-aperture lens is mounted causing index ring to be positioned to place the meter's linear potenioment into a bypass mode to activate the secondary circuit in the meter. The lens is allowed to stop-down and the light is directly measured, however, the shutter speed dial link operates the same in 'MAN' mode. As did the body receiving improvements over time, so did the TTL-Meter have had some changes. Although the image coverage remained unchanged, the type of metering and the circuitry received some upgrades. CdS (cadmium sulfide) to Gpd (gallium photo diode) photo cells and a two part circuit to a single board to improve response time and reliability. The early version is identified by the single marked 'ON' switch and the meter needle starts from UP to down and the later model has a 'ON' & 'OFF' marked switch and the meter needle starts from BOTTOM to top. The later model would also have the sole PENTAX badge by 1986.|$|E

40|$|The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is in {{the process}} of re-inventing itself with {{bilateral}} and multilateral surveillance emerging as a key function. The paper analyses how IMF surveillance announcements may be influenced by political power that member countries exert at the IMF. First, we analyze the content of Article IV Public Information Notices (PIN), and second, we use the financial market reaction to the <b>release</b> <b>PINs</b> as tools to identify the role of political economy factors for IMF surveillance. For a set of emerging market economies, the paper finds that financial markets react more favorable to <b>PIN</b> <b>releases</b> for politically influential member countries.

From many interactions between the client and few members of LBRA, I came across few major difficulties that the disabled persons were facing. The main part we focused is to restrict the seat movement whenever required. From many researches on many locking mechanisms, brakes, <b>release</b> <b>pins</b> and restricted motion mechanisms while considering factors like working conditions, weight aspects and cost, I came up with a simple solution. The solution was that "Locking Pins" could arrest the seat. This is very simple, but yet effective in practical conditions...|$|R

40|$|When {{investigating}} low-frequency (0. 1 Hz) oscillations of miltiphase high-temperature cuprate superconductors (HTSC) Bi 1, 7 Pb 0, 3 Sr 2 Ca(n- 1) CunOy (n= 2 - 30), a wide attenuation peak with a maximal at T= 200 K detected. This peak {{was particularly}} pronounced in field cooling (FC) experiments, i. e. after abrupt cooling {{of the sample}} in the external magnetic field at the temperature T less Tc with subsequent slow warming up to room temperature with invariance of applied field. The attenuation peak height depended on the preliminary orientation (before cooling) of the samples in the measured permanent magnetic field H. On the one hand, it is well khow that, after the FC procedure and subsequent slow warming up, at the temperatures close to the critical temperature Tc, the attenuation peak associated with "melting" of the Abrikosov frozen vortex structure and its disappearance at T more Tc is detected in monophase samples. At the same time, in most multiphase bismuth HTSC samples, synthesized using solar energy and superfast quenching of the melt, the attenuation peak with the maximum at T= 200 K was observed. Depending on the conditions of synthesis, the attenuation peak could be two-humped and could {{be located in the}} temperature range much wider than Tc of the major superconducting phase. We assume that {{this is due to the}} existence of frozen magnetic fluxes (after FC) in superconducting "dropping" regions, which gradually (with increasing temperature) transfer into the normal state and <b>release</b> <b>pinned</b> vortex threads.
