In contrast to the inner part of the heliosheath where the intensity vs. <b>radius</b> <b>profiles</b> in the North and South heliosheaths are much different, these intensity vs. <b>radius</b> <b>profiles,</b> as well as the intensities themselves, are more similar in the outer North and South heliosheaths as measured by V 1 and V 2 respectively. In the N heliosheath, taken to be 27. 6 AU thick beyond the HTS crossing distance of 94 AU, the intensities of termination shock particles and anomalous cosmic rays reach a maximum at between 110 - 112 AU or at a location ~halfway between the termination shock and the heliopause. They then decrease more or less continuously to an intensity ~ 2 / 3 of the maximum for each component just before the final dropout at ~ 121 AU, just inside the heliopause. This intensity-time behavior favors theories in which the acceleration and loss effects lead to a maximum near the middle of the heliosheath. Comment: 14 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

In order to optimize the profile parameters of these gears, a photoelastic investigation was carried out. Models of Wildhaber-Novikov gears made of photoelastic material, Araldite-D, were used in the investigation. Included were the models with various <b>profile</b> <b>radii</b> and fillet radii at different pressure angles. The flank and bending stresses of these gears were determined in each case and were compared with those of involute gears.

It was found that with <b>profile</b> <b>radius</b> up to 1. 5 module, the bending stresses of these gears are lower than those of corresponding involute gears, under identical conditions of loading. It was observed that high pressure angles, when used for Wildhaber-Novikov gears having comparatively smaller <b>profile</b> <b>radii,</b> produce high flank stresses. Gears with larger <b>profile</b> <b>radii,</b> at smaller pressure angles were seen to have a high value for the ratio of flank stress to the bending stress.

40|$|Abstract. Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) are increasingly utilised in {{sheet metal stamping}} in the automotive manufacture. In comparison with conventional steels, AHSS stampings produce higher contact pressures at the interface between the tool-workpiece interface, leading to more severe wear conditions, particularly at the draw die radius. To minimise tool wear using this approach {{it would be necessary}} to optimise the shape for a particular combination of circular and high elliptical profiles. This paper presents a methodology to optimise a die <b>radius</b> <b>profile.</b> For this, a specialised software routine is developed and compiled for optimisation of die radius profiles to minimise or achieve uniform contact pressure (wear distribution) using Python computer programming language supported by Abaqus software.

In this manuscript we compare both coarse-grained (MARTINI force-field) and all-atom simulations, and comment on the accuracy of the MARTINI coarse-grained method for simulating these large membrane protein pore complexes. We report 20 long coarse-grained MARTINI simulations of prototypical pores from two different classes of pore forming toxins (PFTs) in lipid membranes - Cytolysin A (ClyA), which {{is an example of a}}n toxin, and -hemolysin (AHL) which is an example of a toxin. We compare and contrast structural attributes such as the root mean square deviation (RMSD) histograms and the inner pore <b>radius</b> <b>profiles</b> from the MARTINI simulations with all-atom simulations. RMSD histograms sampled by the MARTINI simulations are about a factor of 2 larger, and the <b>radius</b> <b>profiles</b> show that the transmembrane domains of both ClyA and AHL pores undergo significant distortions, when compared with the all-atom simulations. In addition to the fully inserted transmembrane pores, membrane-inserted proteo-lipid ClyA arcs show large shape distortions with a tendency to close in the MARTINI simulations. While this phenomenon could be biologically plausible given the fact that -toxins can form pores of varying sizes, the additional flexibility is probably due to weaker inter-protomer interactions which are modulated by the elastic dynamic network in the MARTINI force-field. We conclude that there is further scope for refining inter-protomer contacts and perhaps membrane-protein interactions in the MARTINI coarse-grained framework. A robust coarse-grained force-field will enable one to reliably carry out mesoscopic simulations which are required to understand protomer oligomerization, pore formation and leakage...|$|R

The free-energy profiles along the transport pathway of LS 2 are calculated for three cation species: a realistic delocalized proton (including Grotthuss shuttling) —H+, a classical (nonshuttling) hydronium—H 3 O+, and a potassium cation—K+. The overall barrier for K+ is approximately twice as large as that for H+, explaining the > 100 times larger maximal ion conductance for the latter, in qualitative agreement with the experimental result. The profile for the classical hydronium is quantitatively intermediate between those of H+ and K+ and qualitatively more similar to that of H+, for which the locations of the peaks are well correlated with the troughs of the pore <b>radius</b> <b>profile.</b> There is a strong correlation between the free-energy profiles and the very different characteristic hydration structures of the three cation species.

40|$|Prediction of {{tool wear}} pattern for sheet metal {{stamping}} die for processing of advanced high strength steel (AHSS) parts is a highly challenging task in automotive applications as there are many control parameters involved in the production. It {{is important to understand}} the impact of these control parameters in order to predict and enhance the tool life of stamping dies. This article presents a numerical simulation methodology to analyze the influences of various control parameters such as the lubrication coefficient, binder holder force, clearance between die and punch, and blank thickness on tool wear pattern of a {{sheet metal stamping}} die with different die radius arc profiles. An equation consisting of adhesive wear and abrasive wear was developed and utilized in a numerical model for wear pattern and the simulations were performed using the finite element software Abaqus 6. 8. The numerical model was validated by a series of channel bending tests. The results suggest that various control parameters have different impacts on the tool wear of die radius, depending on the specified die <b>radius</b> <b>profile.</b> However, for a certain die radius arc profile, the variation of control parameters has limited effects on the locations of first and second peaks of tool wear work over die radius.

We consider the jet kinetic power, the galaxy and cluster atmosphere and the inner structure of the radio source. Analysing radio observations of the inner lobes of Hydra A by Taylor et al. we confirm the jet power estimates ∼ 10 [45] erg s[− 1] derived by Wise et al. from dynamical analysis of the X-ray cavities. With this result and a model for the galaxy halo, we explore the jet–intracluster medium interactions occurring on a scale of 10 kpc using two-dimensional, axisymmetric, relativistic pure hydrodynamic simulations. A key feature is that we identify the three bright knots in the northern jet as biconical reconfinement shocks, which result when an overpressured jet starts to come into equilibrium with the galactic atmosphere. Through an extensive parameter space study we deduce that the jet velocity is approximately 0. 8 c at a distance 0. 5 kpc from the black hole. The combined constraints of jet power, the observed jet <b>radius</b> <b>profile</b> along the jet and the estimated jet pressure and jet velocity imply a value of the jet density parameter χ ≈ 13 for the northern jet.

40|$|The gluon flux {{distribution}} of a static three quark {{system has been}} revealed at finite temperature in the pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory. An action density operator is correlated with three Polyakov loops representing the baryonic state at a temperatures {{near the end of}} the QCD plateau, T/T_c = 0. 8, and another just before the deconfinement point, T/T_c = 0. 9. The flux distributions at short distance separations between the quarks display an action-density profile consistent with a filled Delta shape iso-surface. However the Delta-shaped action iso-surface distributions are found to persist even at large inter-quark separations for both temperatures. The action density distribution in the quark plane exhibits a nonuniform pattern for all quark separations considered. This result contrasts the well-known Y-shaped uniform action density gluonic-flux profile obtained using the Wilson-loop as a quark source operator at zero temperature. We systematically measure and compare the main aspects of the profile of the flux distribution at the two considered temperature scales for three sets of isosceles triangle quark configurations. The radii, amplitudes and rate of change of the width of the flux distribution are found to reverse their behavior as the temperature increase from the end of the QCD plateau region towards the deconfinement point. Remarkably, we find the mean square width of the flux distribution shrinks and localizes for quark separations larger than 1. 0 fm at T/T_c = 0. 8 which results in an identifiable Y-shaped <b>radius</b> <b>profile.</b> Near the deconfinement point, the action-density delocalizes and the width broadens linearly at large quark separations.

40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) are increasingly used in {{sheet metal stamping}} in the automotive industry. In comparison with conventional steels, AHSS stampings produce higher contact pressures at the interface between draw die and sheet metal blank, resulting in more severe wear conditions, particularly at the draw die radius. Developing the ability to accurately predict and reduce the potential tool wear during the tool design stage is vital for shortening lead times and reducing production costs. This thesis investigates the influence of draw die geometry on the wear distribution over the draw die radius for AHSS and develops a methodology for optimising the draw die geometry to reduce wear using numerical and experimental methods. Tool wear predictions on automotive sheet metal forming die and recommended protections of the tool surface under the initial production conditions were obtained from AutoForm simulation software. Effects of lubrication coefficients, binder pressure loads and die coating on tool wear distributions were investigated as well. It is concluded that the areas that are most sensitive to tool wear occurs at the locations corresponding to the large gradient of drawing depth. To study the tool wear distributions for more common stamping parts, a numerical tool wear model was developed and applied using the commercial software package Abaqus. Channel tests are carried out using an Erichsen sheet metal tester with high pressure prescale films to verify the numerical model results. Comparing the results obtained from the prescale film with {{the results from the}} simulation, it is concluded that the contact pressure distributions indicated by the prescale film are consistent with those from the simulation. Various geometries of radius arc profiles, including standard circular profiles, high elliptical profiles, and flat elliptical profiles, were numerically investigated using the tool wear model developed, and the contact pressure distribution and tool wear work along the radii were determined. The following conclusions were reached from the investigations: (1) The colour contour of the high contact pressure on the die radius can be divided into three distinct zones of high pressure and tool wear; (2) The dominant zone leading to maximum contact pressure and tool wear severity depends on the geometry of die <b>radius</b> <b>profile</b> under the same material and process conditions; (3) The geometry of draw die radius has a significant influence on the tool wear and standard circular and elliptical curves can lead to the achievement of reduced and uniform contact pressure distribution (wear distribution) along most of zones of the draw die radius arc. The results suggest that to minimise contact pressure and tool wear using this approach it would be necessary to optimise the shape for a particular combination of material type, thickness and forming process. Effects of control parameters, such as blank geometry, punch geometry, deep-drawing process parameters and tool material, on wear behaviour in deep-drawing for various shape of die radius were then investigated to provide guidelines for impacts of these parameters. A specialised software routine was then compiled for optimisation of die radius profiles to minimise and achieve uniform contact pressure (wear distribution) using Python programming language. The routine was fully integrated with Abaqus software and has the following functions: (1) To provide a user-friendly Graphical User Interface for pre-processing data input for users who have less experience and skill; (2) To optimise a die <b>radius</b> <b>profile</b> according to the control parameters that users input. The results obtained are relevant to the issue of reducing the high tool wear in automotive stamping tools by predicting the causes of such tool wear related to tool geometry and process parameters. They provide useful guidelines for enhancing the tool life of sheet metal processing in automotive industry...|$|E

The production of optimal products using this process {{is dependent on the}} process variables such as blank shapes, <b>profile</b> <b>radii</b> of punch and die, and formability of materials. Of the variables, the blank shape is very important since it controls the formability factor. This paper reports the investigations on three kinds of blank shapes and the scribed circle test on three deformation modes. The punch load distribution for elliptical forming processes were measured under different conditions of <b>profile</b> <b>radii</b> of punch and die and discussed here. These experiments clarified the influence of the <b>profile</b> <b>radii</b> of the punch and die and the blank shape on the punch-load distribution for the elliptical deep drawing product of automobile parts. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect that the process variables have on drawability in a non-axisymmetric elliptical deep-drawing process and to obtain useful data from the industrial field...|$|R
40|$|V-sections were {{roll formed}} from two grades of steel, and {{the strain on}} {{the top and bottom of}} the strip near the edge was {{measured}} using electrical resistance strain gauges. The channels were bent to a radius of 2 and 15 mm along the centerline. The steel strips were of mild and dual phase steel of yield strength 367 MPa and 597 MPa respectively. The longitudinal bow was measured using a 3 -dimensional scanning system. The strain measurements were analysed to determine bending and mid-surface strains at the edge during forming. The peak longitudinal edge strain increased with material yield strength for both <b>profile</b> <b>radii.</b> For the 15 mm radius, the bow was larger in the dual phase steel than in the mild steel. For the 2 mm <b>profile</b> <b>radius,</b> the bow was smaller compared with the 15 mm <b>profile</b> <b>radius</b> and it was similar for both steels. It was observed that the difference between the peak longitudinal edge strain and yield strength to Youngs modulus ratio of the material is an important factor in determining longitudinal bow...|$|R
