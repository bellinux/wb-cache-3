5|$|A half-way line, {{parallel}} to the back line, divides the pitch in two. The start of each period of play and <b>resumption</b> of play following a goal starts with all players in the half they are defending. The line was also used for the obselete offside rule.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{following}} the <b>resumption</b> of shuttle flights in 1988, {{the launch of}} the telescope was scheduled for 1990. On April 24, 1990, shuttle mission STS-31 saw Discovery launch the telescope successfully into its planned orbit.|$|E
40|$|We {{look at the}} {{operational}} semantics of languages with interactive I/O through the glasses of constructive type theory. Following on from our earlier work on coinductive trace-based semantics for While [15], we define several big-step semantics for While with interactive I/O, based on <b>resumptions</b> and termination-sensitive weak bisimilarity. These require nesting inductive definitions in coinductive definitions, which is interesting both mathematically and from the point-of-view of implementation in a proof assistant. After first defining a basic semantics of statements in terms of <b>resumptions</b> with explicit internal actions (delays), we introduce a semantics in terms of delay-free <b>resumptions</b> that essentially removes finite sequences of delays on the fly from those <b>resumptions</b> that are responsive. Finally, we also look at a semantics in terms of delay-free <b>resumptions</b> supplemented with a silent divergence option. This semantics hinges on decisions between convergence and divergence and is only equivalent to the basic one classically. We have fully formalized our development in Coq. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} Samsonvale is, it seems, one of forced <b>resumptions</b> with three {{quarters}} of the Joyner's original pastoral run in the 1860s being taken from them.|$|R
5|$|In 2013, Arsenal invited Galatasaray {{to compete}} at their annual Emirates Cup tournament. Some Arsenal fans reacted {{negatively}} to the news, claiming that there was still bad blood between {{the two sets of}} supporters and were concerned {{that there would be a}} <b>resumption</b> of hostilities between them.|$|E
5|$|In ESRD, some {{eventually}} need hemodialysis {{or equivalent}} renal replacement therapy (RRT). If a kidney transplant is found {{for a patient}} on RRT, the disease will recur in the graft (transplanted kidney) in about 35% of cases, and in 11%, the graft will fail completely (requiring <b>resumption</b> of the RRT and a further transplant).|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, the House {{passed a}} forest {{management}} bill co-sponsored by Oregon Representatives Peter DeFazio, Greg Walden, and Kurt Schrader {{that would include}} increased timber harvests on O lands along with <b>resumption</b> of some Secure Rural Schools funding. President Obama has indicated {{he is likely to}} veto the bill.|$|E
50|$|While the {{homestead}} block remained unaffected, {{the increasing demand}} for land in the Burnett district had reduced the Taabinga run during Youngman's time there. Early <b>resumptions</b> had occurred during Thomas Alford's tenure, reducing {{the size of the}} leased land from the original 305 square miles to 154 square miles at the time of Youngman's succession. Further <b>resumptions</b> occurred in 1901 and 1907, and in August 1911 the government resumed the whole of the run under the Crown Land Act of 1897. Youngman was compensated &pound;11,745 being the value of the resumed land, improvements and legal costs.|$|R
50|$|The Consolidated Pastoral Company {{acquired}} Isis Downs in 1987 {{at which}} time the property occupied an area of 1227 km2 {{after a series of}} land <b>resumptions</b> by the state government for an estimated 10 million.|$|R

5|$|On 1 February 1917, Kaiser Wilhelm II {{personally}} {{approved a}} <b>resumption</b> of unrestricted submarine warfare {{in order to}} try to force the British to make peace. The new rules of engagement specified that no ship was to be left afloat, although British reports for several of UB-43s victims suggest that von Mellenthin was already operating in this manner.|$|E
5|$|Payne {{drew up a}} {{compromise}} bill, in which the <b>Resumption</b> Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks {{would be required to}} build up gold reserves equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three percent each year until 1885, when they would have gold reserves of thirty percent of the value of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard, and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of the <b>Resumption</b> Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter. Specie <b>resumption</b> remained {{the law of the land}} when the 44th Congress's term expired.|$|E
40|$|<b>Resumptions</b> {{appear in}} many forms as a {{convenient}} abstraction, such as in semantics of concurrency and as a programming pattern. In this paper we introduce generalised <b>resumptions</b> in a category-theoretic, coalgebraic context and show their basic properties: they form a monad, they come equipped with a corecursion scheme {{in the sense of}} Adámek et al. 's notion of completely iterative monads (cims), and they enjoy a certain universal property, which specialises to the coproduct with a free cim in the category of cims. © 2014 Elsevier B. V.

5|$|Saggers {{started the}} tour as the clear second-choice wicket-keeper, as Don Tallon {{had played in}} each of Australia's 11 Tests since the <b>resumption</b> of cricket after the Second World War, while Saggers was yet to make his Test debut. Saggers made his {{first-class}} debut shortly {{before the start of}} the war, and after the <b>resumption,</b> was regarded as the second in line for Test selection behind Tallon. However, as Australia did not make any substantial tours in the years immediately after the end of hostilities, there was no need to take a reserve gloveman on such trips. However, the trip to England meant more than six months abroad, so a back-up wicketkeeper was needed, and Saggers was selected for his first national squad.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{finished}} in eighth place in 1914–15 Division One season, before World War I forced the break-up {{of the team}} as men went off to fight on the continent.

5|$|The new {{government}} sought {{to appease the}} protesters by reopening the border with Czechoslovakia. This, however, merely resulted in the <b>resumption</b> of the mass exodus through Hungary via Czechoslovakia.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{the current state}} of the design and implementation of Dops, a framework for Deterministic OPerational Semantics that will support the incremental construction of derivation trees, starting from term/input pairs. This process of derivation tree expansion may terminate with either a complete derivation tree, explaining why a term/input pair evaluates to a particular output, or with a blocked incomplete derivation tree, explaining why a term/input pair fails to evaluate to an output; or the process may go on forever, yielding, in the limit, an infinite incomplete derivation tree, explaining why a term/input pair fails to evaluate to an output. The Dops metalanguage is a typed lambda calculus in which all expressions converge. Semantic rules are specified by lambda terms involving <b>resumptions,</b> which are used by a rule to consume the outputs of sub-evaluations and then resume the rule's work. A rule's type describes the number and kinds of sub-evaluations that the rule can initiate, and indicates whether the rule can block. The semantics of Dops is defined in an object language-independent manner as a small-step semantics on concrete derivation trees: trees involving <b>resumptions.</b> These concrete derivation trees can then be abstracted into ordinary derivation trees by forgetting the <b>resumptions...</b>|$|R
50|$|Following {{his death}} in 1917 the {{property}} passed to his son Norman who had managed Beaconsfield since its purchase. It continued {{as one of the}} larger properties in Queensland's central west until further <b>resumptions</b> were effected in 1929. The property is still held by members of this family.|$|R
50|$|The Government {{committed}} $466 {{million for}} the next section of the Eastern Busway. This funding included 96 property <b>resumptions</b> between Buranda and Cavendish Road, Coorparoo and construction of the 1.05 km section between the South East Busway and Main Avenue, Coorparoo with stations at Stones Corner and Langlands Park.|$|R
5|$|A new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, {{arrived in}} July to replace Liniers, and the independentist {{group did not}} agree on how to react. Castelli {{proposed}} a <b>resumption</b> of Álzaga's idea of creating a governing Junta, but not headed by the Spanish. Belgrano insisted on the plan to appoint Charlotte as regent of a constitutional monarchy, and Rodriguez Peña proposed a military coup, with or without Liniers at the head. They finally accepted the perspective of Cornelio Saavedra, and delayed taking action until a better opportunity.|$|E
5|$|After {{the close}} of the session, Sherman {{returned}} to Ohio to campaign for the Republican nominee for governor there, former governor Rutherford B. Hayes. The issue of specie payments was debated in the campaign, with Hayes endorsing Sherman's position and his Democratic opponent, incumbent Governor William Allen, in favor of increased circulation of greenbacks redeemable in bonds. Hayes won a narrow victory and was soon mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 1876. The controversy over <b>resumption</b> carried into the presidential election. The Democratic platform that year demanded repeal of the <b>Resumption</b> Act, while the Republicans nominated Hayes, whose position in favor of a gold standard was well known. The election of 1876 was very close, and the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Louisiana was one of the states in which both parties claimed victory, and Grant asked Sherman and a few other men to go to New Orleans and ensure the party's interests were represented.|$|E
5|$|British wartime {{participation}} in the Manhattan Project provided a substantial body of expertise that was crucial {{to the success of}} High Explosive Research, the United Kingdom's post-war nuclear weapons programme, although it was not without important gaps, such as in the field of plutonium metallurgy. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a <b>resumption</b> of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, {{the issue}} was raised in {{connection}} with proposals to electrify the Brisbane suburban network. Surveys and plans were finalised in 1954, and in 1955 the State Government announced its decision {{to proceed with the}} construction and initiated land <b>resumptions.</b> However, financial constraints again caused a deferment.|$|R
50|$|Between 1848 and 1865, Rosevale was leased by {{a variety}} of early figures in Queensland history (including Charles Rolleston and Patrick Leslie in 1856, Charles Macarthur King in 1858 and Patrick Mayne in 1862) until {{acquired}} by Henry Mort in the mid-1860s to counter impending <b>resumptions</b> on his Laidley and Franklyn Vale properties.|$|R
50|$|Unregulated and {{unrestrained}} low-cost housing {{developed in}} the area. By the 1870s the area was well known for its poor sanitary conditions. After {{the construction of the}} Central Railway Station and associated <b>resumptions</b> and demolition, industry became established in Surry Hills, with warehouses springing up in streets like Marshall Street. Inner-city housing stock became depleted.|$|R
5|$|During 1943, Bulleid began {{planning}} for the post-war locomotive requirements of the railway and identified {{the need for a}} stop-gap steam locomotive design for those main lines in South East England scheduled for electrification, had the Second World War not taken place. Although the new Merchant Navy class was available for the heaviest Continental expresses, the <b>resumption</b> of frequent passenger services over poorly maintained infrastructure, following the war, would require a lighter locomotive with wider route availability.|$|E
5|$|Following the announcement, {{numerous}} {{residents of}} the town began to sign a list volunteering to enter the structure themselves to continue the search; the owners also announced their intention to seek a court injunction ordering the <b>resumption</b> of search and rescue efforts. After an appeal from local MPP Michael Mantha, whose constituency office was in the mall, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty urged rescue workers to resume their search for survivors.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's {{resignation}} as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795 did {{not remove}} him from public life. With the <b>resumption</b> of his law practice, he remained close to Washington as an advisor and friend. Hamilton influenced Washington {{in the composition of}} his Farewell Address by writing drafts for Washington to compare with the latter's draft, although when Washington contemplated retirement in 1792, he had consulted James Madison for a draft that was used in a similar manner to Hamilton's.|$|E
50|$|When the Roma St to Sandgate railway {{opened in}} 1882, {{it had been}} {{constructed}} via Normanby to avoid the need for land <b>resumptions</b> through the Brisbane CBD. When passenger trains were diverted to the new line via Central station in 1890, traffic diminished significantly, and the section between Exhibition station and Mayne along with Normanby station was closed in 1900.|$|R

Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa {{called on}} North Korea {{to refrain from}} the launch saying [...] "We are {{obviously}} deeply concerned {{by the prospect of}} the launch of the satellite, both in terms of the safety and security issues, but most of all, and not least, in terms of the disruption it is causing to the conditions conducive for the <b>resumptions</b> of six party talks".|$|R
50|$|European {{occupation}} of the Dawson River district followed explorer Ludwig Leichhardt's journey through the area in 1844, during his exploratory journey from Jimbour Homestead to Port Essington. Squatters soon followed, with a licence for Taroom Station issued in 1845. The town of Taroom, named after the station, was surveyed in 1860. Closer settlement commenced in the 1880s, with land <b>resumptions</b> and subdivision under the Crown Lands Act of 1884.|$|R
