5|$|After getting Ron released, {{the parks}} {{department}} holds an intervention for him about Tammy, even playing a previously <b>recorded</b> <b>tape</b> of Ron warning himself {{to stay away}} from her. Ron ignores the warnings and prepares to take Tammy to his cabin for a sex-filled honeymoon after her bridal shower. Leslie blames Tom for the dilemma and, although he initially claims to be unfazed, Tom later arrives at the bridal shower to stop Ron from going on the honeymoon. He reveals the whole marriage is a ploy by Tammy to once again make him miserable. Tammy attacks and mercilessly beats Tom, prompting Ron to remember what a monster she truly is and dump her. He literally carries Tom away, and the two later make amends. Despite the bad impression he made the day before, Ben asks Trumple for the Harvest Festival favor. The chief unconditionally agrees out of respect for Leslie, who he said always helps everyone, and because Leslie once dated his friend Dave (Louis C.K.). Ben seems relieved Leslie and Dave are no longer together, and he later asks Leslie out to eat.|$|E

25|$|On December 7, 1973, {{investigators}} {{found that an}} 18½-minute portion of one <b>recorded</b> <b>tape</b> had been erased. Rose Mary Woods, Nixon’s longtime personal secretary, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her tape player when answering the phone. The press ran photos of the set-up, showing that it was unlikely for Woods {{to answer the phone}} while keeping her foot on the pedal. Later forensic analysis in 2003 determined that the tape had been erased in several segments—at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.|$|E

25|$|The main {{contention}} of Anderson's appeal {{is that a}} secret, illegally <b>recorded</b> <b>tape</b> of him discussing Bonds' steroid use {{was the basis for}} the grand jury questions he refused to answer. Prosecutors, however, said the tape was legal and was made in a face-to-face meeting with Anderson. Although Judge Alsup dismissed Anderson's tape claim and others, the 9th Circuit Court sent Anderson's appeal back to the judge, saying Alsup's ruling regarding the tape was not clear enough. In clarifying his order, Alsup said he agreed with prosecutors that there was ample evidence beyond the tape to question Anderson. Prosecutors also said the questions they wanted answered were based on athletes' secret testimony in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative case and a search of Anderson's house that turned up drug records, some with Bonds' name on it. Other than the tape dispute, the 9th Circuit Court had rejected the merits of Anderson's appeal.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 July 2013, Exaro and Channel 4 news {{broke the}} story of a {{secretly}} <b>recorded</b> <b>tape.</b> The tape was recorded by Sun journalists and in it Murdoch can be heard telling them that the whole investigation was one big fuss over nothing, and that he, or his successors, would take care of any journalists who went to prison. He said: [...] "Why are the police behaving in this way? It's the biggest inquiry ever, over next to nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The idea of {{composing}} {{music that}} could be played at home has been largely abandoned. Bartók {{was among the first}} to part with this idea. [...] "Bartók never conceived these quartets for private performance but rather for large, public concerts." [...] Aside from the many almost insurmountable technical difficulties of many modern pieces, some of them are hardly suitable for performance in a small room. For example, Different Trains by Steve Reich is scored for live string quartet and <b>recorded</b> <b>tape,</b> which layers together a carefully orchestrated sound collage of speech, recorded train sounds, and three string quartets.|$|E

5000|$|GRT Records was {{established}} by parent company General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> in 1969, and existed until 1979, when General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> went bankrupt. [...] Artists who released material on GRT Records in the United States included The Mojo Men, Sam Taylor, Lighthouse, Bobby Jameson, Edwards Hand, Terry Bush, Ronnie Hawkins, Colosseum, Mainline, Minnie Riperton, Flower Travellin' Band, Rastus, String Driven Thing, Lotti Golden, Van der Graaf Generator and Steve Hackett. [...] Contrary to original expectations, the label was not {{a major component of}} the operations of parent General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape.</b> Instead of its record releases being referenced to the GRT label, as originally announced, General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> referred to its Chess/Janus record operations. [...] In contrast, the Canadian subsidiary of General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape,</b> also known as GRT Records, became a major source of original releases by Canadian artists.|$|E

5000|$|General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> later grew {{to acquire}} major labels {{in its own}} right, such as Chess Records and Janus Records, and also {{released}} music under its own label, GRT Records. Its acquisition of Chess Records occurred in 1969, when the company paid Leonard Chess and Phil Chess $6.5 million and 20,000 shares of General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> stock {{for all of the}} shares of Chess Records. [...] Also in 1969, the company established a Canadian subsidiary, GRT Records, which became a major label in Canada during the 1970s. [...] The company in 1969 also established a joint venture with Pye Records, based in England, to form Janus Records in the United States. In 1972, General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> purchased Pye Records' interest in Janus Records and by 1976 reorganized its record production business around Janus Records. At the time, Janus Records proved to be particularly profitable for General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape,</b> due to Al Stewart's [...] "Year of the Cat" [...] achieving gold record status. [...] Earlier, in 1974, General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> had publicly denied rumours that it was in negotiations to merge with ABC Records. At the time, Bayley insisted that the product lines of General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> had strengthened through licensing arrangements with Private Stock Records, which was owned by EMI Records and former executives of Bell Records.|$|E
