50|$|In 1933 two Hughes engineers, one of {{whom was}} Ralph Neuhaus, invented the tricone bit, which has three cones. The Hughes patent for the tricone bit lasted until 1951, after which other {{companies}} made similar bits. However, Hughes still held 40% of the world's drill bit market in 2000. The superior wear performance of PDC bits gradually eroded the dominance of <b>roller</b> cone <b>bits</b> and early in this century PDC drill bit revenues overtook those of <b>roller</b> cone <b>bits.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, {{outside of}} {{the oil and gas}} industry, <b>roller</b> <b>bits</b> using mud {{circulation}} were replaced by the first pneumatic reciprocating piston Reverse Circulation (RC) drills, and became essentially obsolete for most shallow drilling, and are now only used in certain situations where rocks preclude other methods. RC drilling proved much faster and more efficient, and continues to improve with better metallurgy, deriving harder, more durable bits, and compressors delivering higher air pressures at higher volumes, enabling deeper and faster penetration. Diamond drilling has remained essentially unchanged since its inception.|$|R

50|$|It is {{unlikely}} that he actually invented the two-cone <b>roller</b> <b>bit,</b> but his legal experience helped him in understanding that its patents were important for capitalizing on the invention. According to the PBS show History Detectives, several other people and companies had produced similar drill bits years earlier. In its initial tests at Goose Creek Oilfield in 1909 where the first offshore drilling for oil in Texas was occurring in Harris County, 21 mi southeast of Houston on Galveston Bay, the Sharp-Hughes Rock Bit penetrated 14 ft of hard rock in 11 hours which no previous equipment {{had been able to}} penetrate at all.|$|E

The company grew to become a major oil services firm, primarily in acidizing, fracturing and cementing. At its peak, the Western Company had over 5,000 employees and annual worldwide revenues of over $500 million. During the 1970s, the Western Company also operated an offshore drilling company run by Mr. Chiles' brother, Clay Chiles. The company was sold to BJ Services in 1995.|$|E

40|$|Maurer Engineering {{developed}} special high-temperature geothermal turbodrills for LANL in the 1970 s {{to overcome}} motor temperature limitations. These turbodrills {{were used to}} drill the directional portions of LANL`s Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Wells at Fenton Hill, New Mexico. The Hot Dry Rock concept is to drill parallel inclined wells (35 -degree inclination), hydraulically fracture between these wells, and then circulate cold water down one well and through the fractures and produce hot {{water out of the}} second well. At the time LANL drilled the Fenton Hill wells, the LANL turbodrill was the only motor in the world that would drill at the high temperatures encountered in these wells. It was difficult to operate the turbodrills continuously at low speed due to the low torque output of the LANL turbodrills. The turbodrills would stall frequently and could only be restarted by lifting the bit off bottom. This allowed the bit to rotate at very high speeds, and as a result, there was excessive wear in the bearings and on the gauge of insert <b>roller</b> <b>bits</b> due to these high rotary speeds. In 1998, Maurer Engineering developed an Advanced Geothermal Turbodrill (AGT) for the National Advanced Drilling and Excavation Technology (NADET) at MIT by adding a planetary speed reducer to the LANL turbodrill to increase its torque and reduce its rotary speed. Drilling tests were conducted with the AGT using 12 1 / 2 -inch insert <b>roller</b> <b>bits</b> in Texas Pink Granite. The drilling tests were very successful, with the AGT drilling 94 ft/hr in Texas Pink Granite compared to 45 ft/hr with the LANL turbodrill and 42 ft/hr with a rotary drill. Field tests are currently being planned in Mexico and in geothermal wells in California to demonstrate the ability of the AGT to increase drilling rates and reduce drilling costs...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} the absence of any formalized methods showing {{nonlinear}} dependence of the drilling rate on the drilling rod assembly speed has been revealed. The peculiarities, influencing the greatest number of cycles prior to the destruction of bit legs, have been defined. The results of an investigation into the process of impact load harmonics formation and superposition, as well as into the interrelation of drilling process parameters in different loading conditions, with due regard for an adaptive element smoothing the impact load harmonics when passing through rock of different drillability indices, have been adduced.

The approach to determining the <b>roller</b> cone <b>bit</b> speed, at which the bit teeth contact time will be sufficient for energy transfer, resulting in the required rock volume cutting, has been defined.

40|$|Approximately 50 % of {{the cost}} of a new {{geothermal}} power plant is in the wells that must be drilled. Compared to the majority of oil and gas wells, geothermal wells are more difficult and costly to drill for several reasons. First, most U. S. geothermal resources consist of hot, hard crystalline rock formations which drill much slower than the relatively soft sedimentary formations associated with most oil and gas production. Second, high downhole temperatures can greatly shorten equipment life or preclude the use of some technologies altogether. Third, producing viable levels of electricity from geothermal fields requires the use of large diameter bores and a high degree of fluid communication, both of which increase drilling and completion costs. Optimizing fluid communication often requires creation of a directional well to intersect the best and largest number of fracture capable of producing hot geothermal fluids. Moineau motor stators made with elastomers cannot operate at geothermal temperatures, so they are limited to the upper portion of the hole. To overcome these limitations, Maurer Engineering Inc. (MEI) has developed a turbodrill that does not use elastomers and therefore can operate at geothermal temperatures. This new turbodrill uses a special gear assembly to reduce the output speed, thus allowing a larger range of bit types, especially tri-cone <b>roller</b> <b>bits,</b> which are the bits of choice for drilling hard crystalline formations. The Advanced Geothermal Turbodrill (AGT) represents a significant improvement for drilling geothermal wells and has the potential to significantly reduce drilling costs while increasing production, thereby making geothermal energy less expensive and better able to compete with fossil fuels.

The {{results show that the}} value of external load has a direct pronounced effect on the contact characteristics of journal bearing. There is a significant positive correlation between contact pressure and external load, radius clearance value, and the Young's modulus of material. However, there is an evident negative correlation between contact radius of journal bearing and radius clearance value, and the Young's modulus of material. The smaller radius clearance value of journal bearing is, the more centralized contact region will be, so the corresponding contact pressure will be higher. From the perspective of reducing friction and wear, we need select the materials which have high strength and good toughness. Not only might this can improve the wear resistance, it also effectively decreases the contact pressure.

40|$|Rotary {{drilling}} with <b>roller</b> cone <b>bit</b> {{is often}} accompanied by wide fluctuations of the weight on bit (WOB). In certain cases the WOB periodically reduces to null. It has been postulated that in these cases the bit lifts off from the formation surface. The present study models the interaction among the lift-off of the bit, the WOB variation, and the modulation of the amplitude of the lobes on the formation surface. The analytical model is used to obtain numerical results for a specific drillstring. From these results it is inferred that the rotary speeds corresponding to the axial resonant frequencies of the system, determined from {{the functions of the}} driving point mobility and impedance at the bit, are critical regarding the wide fluctuations of the WOB.

50|$|Several factors affect {{drill bit}} selection. Due {{to the high}} number of wells that have been drilled, {{information}} from an adjacent well is most often used to make the appropriate selection. Two different types of drill bits exist: fixed cutter and roller cone. A fixed cutter bit is one where there are no moving parts, but drilling occurs due to shearing, scraping or abrasion of the rock. Fixed cutter bits can be either polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) or grit hotpressed inserts (GHI) or natural diamond. <b>Roller</b> cone <b>bits</b> can be either tungsten carbide inserts (TCI) for harder formations or milled tooth (MT) for softer rock. The manufacturing process and composites used in each type of drill bit make them ideal for specific drilling situations. Additional enhancements can be made to any bit to increase the effectiveness for almost any drilling situation.|$|R
40|$|This project used {{a systems}} {{approach}} to improve slim-hole drilling performance. A high power mud motor, having a double-length power section, and hybrid PDC/TSP drill bit {{were developed to}} deliver maximum horsepower to the rock while providing a long life down hole. This high-power slim-hole drilling system drills much faster than conventional slim-hole motor and bit combinations and holds significant potential to reduce slim-hole drilling costs. The oil and gas industries have been faced with downward price pressures since the 1980 s. These pressures {{are not expected to}} be relieved in the near future. To maintain profitability, companies have had to find ways to reduce the costs of producing oil and gas. Drilling {{is one of the more}} costly operations in the production process. One method to reduce costs of drilling is to use smaller more mobile equipment. Slim holes have been drilled in the past using this principle. These wells can save money not only from the use of smaller drilling equipment, but also from reduced tubular costs. Stepping down even one casing size results in significant savings. However, slim holes have not found wide spread use for three reasons. First, until recently, the price of oil has been high so there were no forces to move the industry in this direction. Second, small <b>roller</b> <b>bits</b> and motors were not very reliable and they drilled slowly, removing much of the economic benefit. The third and final reason was the misconception that large holes were needed everywhere to deliver the desired production. Several factors have changed that will encourage the use of slim holes. The industry now favors any method of reducing the costs of producing oil and gas. In addition, the industry now understands that large holes are not always needed. Gas, in particular, can have high production rates in smaller holes. New materials now make it possible to manufacture improved bits and motors that drill for long periods at high rates. All that remains is to gather all the elements together and demonstrate the savings of slim hole drilling...|$|R

Several high-temperature wells have been drilled at The Geysers geothermal field and its environs. The Wilson No. 1 well was drilled in 1981 outside of the main field on the flanks of Mount Hannah {{to a depth of}} 3672  m (Fournier 1991; DOGGR online well records 1982). While the maximum measured (unequilibrated) temperature for this well is 325  °C, fluid inclusions recovered in cuttings suggest bottom-hole temperatures of up to 400  °C. A high-pressure zone was encountered {{near the bottom of the}} well, and a steam entry was observed at total depth. Casing collapse led to abandonment of the well. The highest temperatures that have been encountered to date at The Geysers were measured in a well that was deepened in 2010 as part of a US DOE-funded EGS field demonstration project in the NW Geysers high-temperature reservoir. A steam entry was encountered in the deepened Prati- 32 well at 3352  m with a measured temperature of 400  °C.
