40|$|Cryptographic and {{authentication}} {{applications in}} application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), {{as well as}} codes for the activation of on-chip features, {{require the use of}} embedded secret information. The generation of secret bitstrings using physical unclonable functions, or PUFs, provides several distinct advantages over conventional methods, including the elimination of costly non-volatile memory, and the potential to increase the random bits available to applications. In this dissertation, a Hardware-Embedded Delay PUF (HELP) is proposed that is designed to leverage path delay variations that occur in the core logic macros of a chip to create random bitstrings. A thorough discussion is provided of the operational details of an embedded path timing structure called REBEL that is used by HELP to provide the timing functionality upon which HELP relies for the entropy source for the cryptographic quality of the bitstrings. Further details of the FPGA-based implementation used to prove the viability of the HELP PUF concept are included, along with a discussion of the evolution of the techniques employed in realizing the final PUF engine design. The bitstrings produced by a set of 30 FPGA boards are evaluated with regard to several statistical quality metrics including uniqueness, randomness, and stability. The stability characteristics of the bitstrings are evaluated by subjecting the FPGAs to commercial-grade temperature and power supply voltage variations. In particular, this work evaluates the reproducibility of the bitstrings generated at 0 C, 25 C, and 70 C, and 10 % of the <b>rated</b> <b>supply</b> <b>voltage.</b> A pair of error avoidance schemes are proposed and presented that provide significant improvements to the HELP PUF's resiliency against bit-flip errors in the bitstrings.

40|$|As {{communication}} {{distances and}} bit rates increase, optoelectronic interconnects are being deployed for designing highbandwidth low-latency interconnection networks for high performance computing (HPC) systems. While bandwidth scaling with efficient multiplexing techniques (wavelengths, time and space) are available, static assignment of wavelengths can {{be detrimental to}} network performance for nonuniform (adversial) workloads. Dynamic bandwidth re-allocation based on actual traffic pattern can lead to improved network performance by utilizing idle resources.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a real-time task scheduling tech-nique with a variable voltage processor which can vary its <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> dynamically. Using such a processor, running tasks {{with a low}} <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> leads to drastic power reduction. However, reducing the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> may violate real-time constraints. In this paper, we propose a scheduling technique which simultaneously assigns both CPU time and a <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> to each task so as to mini-mize total energy consumption while satisfying all real-time constraints. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed technique. 1...|$|R
40|$|Multiple <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> {{are often}} {{utilized}} to decrease power dissipation in high performance integrated circuits. On-chip power distribution grids with multiple <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> {{are discussed in}} this paper. A power distribution grid with multiple <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> and multiple grounds is presented. The proposed power delivery scheme reduces power <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> drops as compared to conventional power distribution systems with dual supplies and a single ground by 17 % on average (20 % maximum). For an example power grid with decoupling capacitors placed between the power supply and ground, the proposed grid with multiple supply and multiple ground exhibits, respectively, 13 % and 18 % average performance improvement. The proposed power distribution grid can be an alternative to a single <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> and single ground power distribution system.

40|$|A design {{technique}} {{based on}} optimizing the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> for simultaneously achieving {{energy efficiency and}} temperature variation insensitive circuit performance is proposed in this paper. The <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> that suppress the propagation delay variations when the temperature fluctuates are identified for a diverse set of circuits in 180 and 65 nm CMOS technologies. Circuits display temperature variation insensitive propagation delay when operated at a <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> 44 - 47 % lower than the nominal <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> (V DD = 1. 8 V) in a 180 nm CMOS technology. Similarly, the optimum <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> are 67 - 68 % lower than the nominal <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> (V DD = 1. 0 V) in a 65 nm CMOS technology. At scaled <b>supply</b> <b>voltages,</b> integrated circuits consume lower power {{at the cost of}} reduced speed. The proposed design methodology of optimizing the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> for temperature variation insensitive circuit performance is, therefore, particularly attractive for low-power applications with relaxed speed requirements. A new design methodology based on threshold voltage optimization for achieving temperature variation insensitive circuit speed is also evaluated. The energy per cycle and the propagation delay at the <b>supply</b> and threshold <b>voltages</b> providing temperature variation insensitive circuit performance, minimum energy-delay product, and minimum energy are compared. Results indicate that low-power operation and temperature variation tolerance can be simultaneously achieved with the proposed techniques. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|<b>Supply</b> <b>Voltage</b> Supervisor (SVS, or <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> {{supervisory}} circuit) circuits {{are used}} to monitor the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> to embedded and other micro-controller systems for under voltage conditions. If an under voltage condition is detected then the supervisory circuit will reset the controller and keep it in that state {{as long as the}} under voltage condition persists. This type of reset is called brown out reset. In many modern day Micro-controllers like Texas Instrument's MSP430 MCU, Brown Out Reset protection is implemented into most MSP430 devices in the case of unstable <b>supply</b> <b>voltages.</b>|$|R
