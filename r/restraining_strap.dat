50|$|The {{flight was}} also memorable for its {{dramatic}} re-entry. The craft's service module did not separate, so it entered the atmosphere nose-first, leaving cosmonaut Boris Volynov hanging by his <b>restraining</b> <b>straps.</b> As the craft aerobraked, the atmosphere burned through the module. But the craft righted itself before the escape hatch was burned through. Then, the parachute lines tangled and the landing rockets failed, {{resulting in a}} hard landing which broke Volynov's teeth.|$|R
50|$|The trucks {{have many}} safety features, several {{of which are}} {{required}} just {{to run in the}} small arenas that the trucks frequent. Trucks are equipped with three shut-off switches: the RII (Remote Ignition Interrupt), one within the driver's reach in the cab, and another {{at the rear of the}} truck so that all electrical power may be shut off in the event of a rollover. Many trucks are constructed with the driver sitting in the center of the cab for visibility. Most cabs are shielded with Lexan (or comparable polycarbonate), which not only protects the driver from track debris, but also allows for increased visibility. Drivers are required to wear firesuits, safety harnesses, helmets, and head and neck restraints. Most moving parts on the truck are also shielded, and high pressure components have <b>restraining</b> <b>straps,</b> both in case of an explosion.|$|R

The history of Icelandic psychiatry {{is in many ways}} comparable with neighboring countries. Mentally ill people were badly treated in the country and received no medical treatment until {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century. Kleppur Hospital for the mentally insane was built in 1907; hence the development was approximately 150 years later than in comparable countries. Only two doctors contributed significantly to policy making in Icelandic psychiatry until 1959 and they were very different personalities. Dr Thórdur Sveinsson was famous for his interest in hydrotherapy and Dr Helgi Tómasson for his prohibition of all physical restraints like straitjackets, <b>restraining</b> <b>straps</b> and belts. He was also known for his decision to prohibit his patients undergoing ECT and lobotomy; hence such methods were never practiced at Kleppur Hospital. In other respects, it may be said that the history of Icelandic psychiatry is similar to that in the other Nordic countries...|$|R

5000|$|Physicist {{received}} positive reviews, but {{is generally}} considered a low point in Townsends career. Townsend himself considers it his worst album to date. Trey Spencer of Sputnikmusic argued that while Physicist is [...] "a pretty good listen" [...] on its own merit, it is [...] "one of the weakest" [...] albums in Townsends catalogue. He felt the album [...] "comes off as a <b>restrained</b> version of <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad with hints of Townsends other projects thrown in", and {{that most of the}} tracks dont [...] "seem to go anywhere". In 2005 the album placed number 439 in Rock Hard magazines book The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.|$|R
5000|$|Yvonne Smith, a {{certified}} hypnotherapist and abduction researcher, notes that [...] "startling similarities" [...] between abductees reporting procedures {{performed on the}} head arise when comparing reports of hypnotically retrieved abduction memories. She states that the most commonly reported sensations and procedures performed to the head are feelings of pressure in or {{on the head and}} the insertion of needles into the scalp. During cranial procedures the abductee's head is often <b>restrained</b> by a <b>strap</b> or metal bar drawn across the forehead. The abductors sometimes will touch the forehead of the experiencer, which strangely, seems to ease their anxiety and whatever physical pain they may be experiencing.|$|R

Thompson 2; 1 Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK; 2 Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of ankle position on passive torque (PT), range of motion (ROM), and electromyography (EMG) of the posterior hip and thigh muscles during a passive straight-leg raise (SLR) assessment. METHODS: Thirteen healthy participants (mean±SD age= 23 ± 2 yr; mass= 69 ± 15 kg; height= 169 ± 10 cm) performed six randomly ordered passive SLR assessments involving two assessments at each condition, which included the ankle positioned in dorsiflexion (DF), plantar flexion (PF), and a neutral (NTRL) position. All SLRs were performed using an isokinetic dynamometer programmed in passive mode to move the foot toward the head at 5 °·s- 1. For each SLR, participants laid in a supine position, with the knee braced in full-extension and the ankle immobilized in either 10 ° of DF, 10 ° of PF, or a NTRL (0 °) position using an adjustable, custom-built stabilizing apparatus. All assessments were conducted on the right leg, while the left thigh and ankle were secured with <b>restraining</b> <b>straps.</b> Bipolar surface EMG amplitude of the biceps femoris was sampled during each SLR and expressed {{as a percentage of}} the maximal EMG amplitude that was corrected for initial baseline noise. PT and EMG amplitude were determined at four common joint angles (θ) separated by 5 ° during the final common 15 ° ROM for each participant. RESULTS: Maximum ROM was lower for the DF than the NTRL (P= 0. 003) and PF (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) conditions. PT was greater for the DF than the NTRL and PF conditions at θ 3 (P= 0. 001) and was greater for the DF than the NTRL condition at θ 4 (P= 0. 003) but was not different between conditions at θ 1 and θ 2 (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) (Figure 1). PT also increased with joint angle for the DF, PF, and NTRL conditions (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). There were no joint angle or condition-related differences (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) for EMG. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the SLRs performed with the ankle positioned in DF elicited greater PT and lower ROM of the posterior hip and thigh muscles than the SLRs with the ankle positioned in PF or a NTRL position...|$|R
50|$|A vehicle-sensitive lock {{is based}} on a {{pendulum}} swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle. In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover, the reel is unlocked and the belt strap may be pulled from the reel against the spring tension of the reel. The vehicle occupant can move around with relative freedom while the spring tension of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant. When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover, a pawl is engaged, the reel locks and the <b>strap</b> <b>restrains</b> the belted occupant in position. Dual-sensing locking retractors use both vehicle G-loading and webbing payout rate to initiate the locking mechanism.|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground. The {{velocity}} of reaching movements is often reduced {{in patients with}} stroke-related hemiparesis; however,they are able to voluntarily increase paretic hand velocity. Previous studies have proposed that faster speed improvesmovement quality. Objective. To investigate the combined effects of reaching distance and speed instruction on trunk andparetic upper-limb coordination. The hypothesis was that increased speed would reduce elbow extension and increasecompensatory trunk movement. Methods. A single session study in which reaching kinematics were recorded in a groupof 14 patients with spastic hemiparesis. A 3 -dimensional motion analysis system was used to track the trajectories of 5 reflective markers fixed on the finger, wrist, elbow, acromion, and sternum. The reaching movements were performedto 2 targets at 60 % and 90 % arm length, respectively, at preferred and maximum velocity. The experiment was repeatedwith the trunk <b>restrained</b> by a <b>strap.</b> Results. All the patients were able to voluntarily increase reaching velocity. In thetrunk free, faster speed condition, elbow extension velocity increased but elbow extension amplitude decreased and trunkmovement increased. In the trunk restraint condition, elbow extension amplitude did not decrease with faster speed. Seven patients scaled elbow extension and elbow extension velocity {{as a function of}} reach distance, the other 7 mainlyincreased trunk compensation with increased task constraints. There were no clear clinical characteristics that couldexplain this difference. Conclusions. Faster speed may encourage some patients to use compensation. Individual indicationsfor therapy could be based on a quantitative analysis of reaching coordination...|$|R
