5000|$|Sparassodonta is an extinct {{order of}} {{carnivorous}} metatherian mammals native to South America. They were once {{considered to be}} true marsupials, but are now thought to be either a sister taxon to them, or considerably distantly <b>related,</b> <b>part</b> of a separate clade of Gondwanan metatherians. A number of these mammalian predators closely resemble placental predators that evolved separately on other continents, and are cited frequently as examples of convergent evolution. They were first described by Florentino Ameghino, from fossils found in the Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia. Sparassodonts were present throughout South America's long period of [...] "splendid isolation" [...] during the Cenozoic; during this time they shared the niches for large warm-blooded predators with the flightless terror birds. Previously, {{it was thought that}} these mammals died out in the face of competition from [...] "more competitive" [...] placental carnivorans during the Pliocene Great American Interchange, but more recent research has showed that sparassodonts died out long before eutherian carnivores arrived in South America (aside from procyonids).|$|E
50|$|Phylogenetic {{profiling}} finds {{pairs of}} protein families with similar patterns of {{presence or absence}} across large numbers of species. This method {{is based on the}} hypothesis that potentially interacting proteins should co-evolve and should have orthologs in closely related species. That is, proteins that form complexes or are part of a pathway should be present simultaneously {{in order for them to}} function. A phylogenetic profile is constructed for each protein under investigation. The profile is basically a record of whether the protein is present in certain genomes. If two proteins are found to be present and absent in the same genomes, those proteins are deemed likely to be functionally related. A similar method can be applied to protein domains, where profiles are constructed for domains to determine if there are domain interactions. Some drawbacks with the phylogenetic profile methods are that they are computationally expensive to perform, they rely on homology detection between distant organisms, and they only identify if the proteins being investigated are functionally <b>related</b> (<b>part</b> of complex or in same pathway) and not if they have direct interactions.|$|E
50|$|The {{museum has}} mounted {{exhibits}} on national themes through history in New York. For instance, beginning in 2005 with Slavery and the Making of New York, 1600s - 1827, it mounted the first exhibition ever in New York City {{on the major}} but little-known role of slavery in the city's economy and history. During the colonial years, 41% of households had slaves, {{and much of the}} city's economy through the Civil War was related to the South and slavery; half of its exports were related to cotton. Devoting the entire first floor to the exhibit, the museum mounted the largest theme exhibit in its 200-year history. It also addressed the strengths of African Americans who resisted slavery and created their own culture, both in New York and the nation. A <b>related</b> <b>part</b> of the exhibit was commissioning 20 new works by invited artists, some of whom used objects from the museum's collections to create new works and installations on this theme. The second exhibition was New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War, 1827-1865, (November 17, 2006 to September 3, 2007), which explored the economy before the war and strong business ties to the South, events related to the war such as the New York City Draft Riots, and other aspects. Southerners visited New York so frequently in the antebellum era that they had favorite hotels.|$|E
