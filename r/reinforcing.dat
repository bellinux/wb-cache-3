Three pairs of <b>reinforcer</b> delays were arranged in each session, and <b>reinforcer</b> durations were varied over conditions.

40|$|Effect of bond on {{compressive}} behaviour of {{flax fibre}} <b>reinforced</b> polymer tube–confined coir fibre <b>reinforced</b> concrete Libo Yan 1, Anne Duchez 1, 2 and Nawawi Chouw 1 This {{study investigated the}} effect of flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer and concrete bond on the compressive behaviour of flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer–confined plain concrete and coir fibre <b>reinforced</b> concrete. Three types of bond were considered, i. e. concrete confined by (1) flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer tube, (2) flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer tube with internal flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer rings and (3) flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer wrapping. They were termed as naturally, mechanically and adhesively bonded, respectively. A total of 18 flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer–confined plain concrete and coir fibre <b>reinforced</b> concrete cylinders were tested under axial compression. The test results indicated that all the three flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer confinements increased the ultimate compressive strength and ductility of the concrete significantly compared to the unconfined concrete. It {{was found that the}} type of flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer and concrete bond has a significant effect on the ultimate strength and axial strain of the confined cylinders.

In all cases of flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer–confined coir fibre <b>reinforced</b> concrete, the coir fibre inclusion reduced the numbers and widths of the cracks in the concrete.

In recent years however, bamboo has generated interest from researchers as a candidate to replace environmental unfriendly glass as fiber in fiber <b>reinforced</b> composites.

This paper is to review on the properties of bamboo <b>reinforced</b> composites from numerous characterization studies of bamboo that are available in the literatures. The review is based on characterization studies on several types of bamboo <b>reinforced</b> composites such as laminated bamboo fiber <b>reinforced</b> composite, randomly oriented bamboo <b>reinforced</b> composite, hybrid fiber <b>reinforced</b> composite, bamboo fiber <b>reinforced</b> bio-composite and bamboo fiber sandwiched structure composite. It can be said that the laminated bamboo composite in general gives higher mechanical properties compare to other structural forms of bamboo composite. Even though bamboo bio-composite in general provides low mechanical properties, the properly design unidirectional bamboo bio-composite can also have high mechanical properties that are as good as the laminated bamboo <b>reinforced</b> composite. While specific tensile properties of laminated bamboo <b>reinforced</b> composite are at par with glass fiber <b>reinforced</b> composite, the mechanical properties of bamboo fiber <b>reinforced</b> composite are comparable to the mechanical properties of the best among natural fiber <b>reinforced</b> composites...|$|R
