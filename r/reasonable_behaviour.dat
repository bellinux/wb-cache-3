40|$|Due {{to safety}} and ethical issues, {{traditional}} experimental approaches to modelling underground risk behaviours can be costly, dangerous and even impossible to realize. Based on multi-agent technology, a virtual coalmine platform for risk behaviour simulation {{is presented to}} model and simulate the human-machine-environment related risk factors in underground coalmines. To reveal mine workers' risk behaviours, a fuzzy emotional behaviour model is proposed to simulate underground miners' responding behaviours to potential hazardous events based on cognitive appraisal theories and fuzzy logic techniques. The proposed emotion model can generate more believable behaviours for virtual miners according to personalized emotion states, internal motivation needs and behaviour selection thresholds. Finally, typical accident cases of underground hazard spotting and locomotive transport were implemented. The behaviour believability of virtual miners was evaluated with a user assessment method. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed models can create more realistic and <b>reasonable</b> <b>behaviours</b> in virtual coalmine environments, which can improve miners' risk awareness and further train miners' emergent decision-making ability when facing unexpected underground situations...|$|R

40|$|We have {{explored}} the manifold physical scenario {{emerging from a}} model of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) via thermal mixing under the hypothesis of highly effective electron-electron interaction. When the electron and nuclear reservoirs are also assumed to be in strong thermal contact and the microwave irradiation saturates the target electron transition, the enhancement of the nuclear polarization {{is expected to be}} considerably high even if the irradiation frequency is set far away from the centre of the ESR line (as already observed by Borghini) and the typical polarization time is reduced on moving towards the boundaries of said line. More <b>reasonable</b> <b>behaviours</b> are obtained by reducing the level of microwave saturation or the contact between electrons and nuclei in presence of nuclear leakage. In both cases the function describing the dependency of the steady state nuclear polarization on the frequency of irradiation becomes sharper at the edges and the build up rate decreases on moving off-resonance. If qualitatively similar in terms of the effects produced on nuclear polarization, the degree of microwave saturation and of electron-nucleus contact has a totally different impact on electron polarization, which is of course strongly correlated to the effectiveness of saturation and almost insensitive, at the steady state, to the magnitude of the interactions between the two spin reservoirs. The likelihood of the different scenario is discussed {{in the light of the}} experimental data currently available in literature, to point out which aspects are suitably accounted and which are not by the declinations of thermal mixing DNP considered here.

The consequences on the mechanical properties {{and on the}} porosity of the mortars are discussed. These mortars indicate a combined hardening reaction of cement hydration and lime carbonation. Under dry and moist conditions independent from moisture content, cement hydration proceeds faster than carbonation reaction which evolves gradually. Only the degree of these two reactions {{is influenced by the}} moisture content. Hydration reactions are favoured under moist conditions while carbonation reaction is enhanced under dry conditions. Competition between hydration and carbonation takes place only under accelerated conditions where carbonation leads to decalcification of the hydrated phases without negatively affecting the strength development of the mortars.
