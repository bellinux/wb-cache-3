Recently, two different color morphs of Plectropomus leopardus were discovered and the biological {{importance of the}} color difference is unknown. Since coral trout species are poorly characterized at the molecular level, we undertook the transcriptomic characterization of the two color morphs, one black and one red coral trout, using Illumina next generation sequencing technologies. The study produced 55162966 and 54588952 paired-end reads, for black and <b>red</b> <b>trout,</b> respectively. De novo transcriptome assembly generated 95367 and 99424 unique sequences in black and <b>red</b> <b>trout,</b> respectively, with 88813 sequences shared between them. Approximately 50 % of both trancriptomes were functionally annotated by BLAST searches against protein databases. The two trancriptomes were enriched into 25 functional categories and showed similar profiles of Gene Ontology category compositions. 34110 unigenes were grouped into 259 KEGG pathways. Moreover, we identified 14649 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and designed primers for potential application. We also discovered 130524 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the two transcriptomes, supplying potential genomic resources for the coral trout species. In addition, we identified 936 fast-evolving genes and 165 candidate genes under positive selection between the two color morphs. Finally, 38 candidate genes underlying the mechanism of color and pigmentation were also isolated.

40|$|AbstractUsing a {{panel of}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies, it has previously been demonstrated that the cytosol of nucleated <b>red</b> cells (<b>trout</b> and turkey) contains a protein similar to arrestin, a soluble protein found so far only in the photosensitive cells and which, by binding to photoexcited rhodopsin, inhibits the phototransduction process. The role of this arrestin-like protein in non-photosensitive cells is questionable. In this report we present evidence that partially purified red blood cell arrestin (RBC arrestin) behaves functionally like bovine retinal arrestin: it binds to phosphorylated bovine rhodopsin only when this receptor has been photoactivated. Thus RBC arrestin and bovine retinal arrestin are closely related both structurally and functionally. By analogy with the function of retinal arrestin, it is proposed that RBC arrestin is involved in desensitization of membrane transport proteins and/or adrenergic receptors...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} uptake of L-serine by <b>trout</b> <b>red</b> blood cells {{and the effect}} of a / 5 -adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol) on this process.

The uptake seems to be mediated both by a sodium-dependent process and by a sodium-independent process. The sodium-dependent uptake is mediated by a transport system that probably belongs to the ASC system family. Isoproterenol exerts an inhibitory effect on L-serine uptake. This effect is dose-dependent. It is proposed that the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol is mediated by a rise in the intracellular sodium concentration and/or changes in cell volume...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{comparative}} rheology of individual red blood cells from humans and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at their natural body temperatures. <b>Trout</b> <b>red</b> blood cells were large ellipsoids (about 16 mm 31. 5 mm 32. 5 mm) with a mean volume of 250 fl, a surface area of approximately 350 mm 2 and an elongated nucleus of about 9 mm 35 mm. Although much larger than human red cells (diameter 8 mm, V= 92 fl, A= 136 mm 2), both theoretical calculation and experimental aspiration into micropipettes indicated that the limiting size of a cylindrical vessel that both types of cell could enter was approximately 3 mm. Nevertheless, individual <b>trout</b> <b>red</b> cells had much longer transit times through 5 mm filter pores and were much slower to enter 3 ‚Äì 4 mm diameter micropipettes. Interestingly, the relative deformability of the trout cells depended on the pore size and applied pressure, with entry times for trout and human cells converging as pipette diameter increased. The relatively poor overall cellular deformability of the trout cells reflected their membrane rigidity (shear elastic modulus 4 ‚Äì 5 times {{higher than that of}} human membrane), as well as their large size and the presence of a prominent nucleus. Capillary diameters in trout muscle are similar to those in the human microcirculation (about 3 mm), while systemic driving pressures are much lower. Therefore, either red cell deformability is a less critical circulatory parameter than has previously been thought, or the apparently disadvantageous blood rheology of trout is adequate because of the lower demand for tissue perfusion...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} shown that the {{addition}} of a ~-adrenergic catecholamine to a <b>trout</b> <b>red</b> blood cell suspension induces a 60 - 100 -fold increase of sodium permeability resulting from the activation of a cAMP-dependent Na+/H + antiport. Subsequent addition of propranolol almost instantaneously reduces the intracellular cAMP concentration, and thus the Na permeability, to their basal values (Mah 6 et al., 1985). If glutaraldehyde (0. 06 - 0. 1 %) is added when the Na+/H + exchanger is activated after hormonal stimulation, addition of propranolol no longer inhibits Na permeability: once activated and fixed by glutaraldehyde, the cAMP dependence disappears. Glutaraldehyde alone causes a rapid decrease in the cellular cAMP concentration. In its fixed state the antiporter is fully amiloride sensitive. The switching on of the Na+/H ¬ß exchange by cAMP is rapidly (2 rain) followed by acute but progressive desensitization of the exchanger (Garcia-Romeu et al., 1988). The desensitization depends on the concentration of external sodium, being maximal at a normal Na concentration (145 mM) and nonexistent at a low Na concentration (20 raM). If gluteraldehyde is added after activation in nondesensitizing conditions (20 mM Na), transfer to a Na-rich medium induces only a very slight desensitization: thus the fixative can "freeze " the exchanger in the nondesensitizing conformation. NO ~ inhibits the activity of the cAMP-dependent Na+/H + antiporter of the <b>trout</b> <b>red</b> blood cell (Borgese et al., 1986).
