There are some significant and consistent differences in the major and trace element compositions of crustal components with time which have important implications for crustal growth processes. These will be illustrated with reference to Archean rocks from a number of shield areas, Proterozoic granitoids from Australia and elsewhere, Palaeozoic granitoids from Australia and Scotland, and Mesozoic - recent granitoids from present continental margin belts. Surprisingly some rather simple and consistent patterns energy using this technique.

However, the {{spent catalyst}} has, generally, a good level of activity {{and can be used}} if mixed with fresh catalyst. In this work the operation of an industrial methanol synthesis reactor with mixtures of fresh and partially deactivated catalyst was investigated using a one-dimensional transient model. Analysis of the deactivation behavior of low-pressure methanol synthesis catalyst shows there is an extremely sharp rate of deactivation in {{a small part of the}} catalyst life-time, which is followed by a relatively slow rate of deactivation in the remaining catalyst cycle-time.

Recycling scrap aluminium requires only 5% of the energy used to make new aluminium. For this reason, approximately 31% of all aluminium produced in the United States comes from recycled scrap. Used beverage containers are the largest component of processed aluminum scrap, {{and most of it}} is manufactured back into aluminium cans.|$|E

Given the immobility of plant cells, localized membrane vesicle secretion and <b>recycling</b> <b>are</b> amongst <b>the</b> main <b>processes</b> guiding proper cell, tissue and whole plant morphogenesis. Cell wall biogenesis and modification {{are dependent on}} vectorial membrane traffic, not only during normal development, but also in stress responses and in plant defence against pathogens and/or symbiosis. It is surprising how little we know about these processes in plants, from small GTPase regulation to the tethering complexes that act as their effectors. Tethering factors are single proteins or protein complexes mediating first contact between the target membrane and arriving membrane vesicles. In this review {{we focus on the}} tethering complexes of the best-studied plant model – Arabidopsis thaliana. Genome-based predictions indicate the presence of all major tethering complexes in plants that are known from a hypothetical last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). The evolutionary multiplication of paralogs of plant tethering complex subunits has produced the massively expanded EXO 70 family, indicating a subfunctionalization of the terminal exocytosis machinery in land plants. Interpretation of loss of function (LOF) mutant phenotypes has to consider that related, yet clearly functionally-specific complexes often share some common core subunits. It is therefore impossible to conclude with clarity which version of <b>the</b> complex <b>is</b> responsible for <b>the</b> phenotypic deviations observed. Experimental interest in the analysis of plant tethering complexes is growing and we hope to contribute with this review by attracting even more attention to this fascinating field of plant cell biology...|$|R

50|$|Tire {{recycling}}, or rubber <b>recycling,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> {{of recycling}} waste tires {{that are no}} longer suitable for use on vehicles due to wear or irreparable damage. These tires are a problematic source of waste, due to the large volume produced, the durability of the tires, and the components in the tire that are ecologically problematic. Because they are highly durable and non-biodegradable, they can consume valued space in landfills. In 1990, {{it was estimated that}} over 1 billion scrap tires were in stockpiles in the United States. As of 2015, only 67 million tires remain in stockpiles. From 1994 to 2010, the European Union increased the amount of tires recycled from 25% of annual discards to nearly 95%, with roughly half of the end-of-life tires used for energy, mostly in cement manufacturing. Newer technology, such as pyrolysis and devulcanization, has made tires suitable targets for recycling despite their bulk and resilience. End uses for tires include tire-derived fuels, new rubber products, playground surfacing, new tires, and rubber modified asphalt.|$|E

These tyres are among {{the largest and most}} problematic sources of waste, due to the large volume produced and their durability. Those same characteristics which make waste tyres such a problem also make them one of the most re-used waste materials, as the rubber is very resilient and can be reused in other products. In the United States, approximately one tyre is discarded per person per year. However, material recovered from waste tyres, known as [...] "crumb" [...] is generally only a cheap [...] "filler" [...] material and is rarely used in high volumes. Tyre recycling is also fairly common. Used tires can be added to asphalt for producing road surfaces or to make rubber mulch used on playgrounds, basketball courts and new shoe products. They are also often used as the insulation and heat absorbing/releasing material in specially constructed homes known as earthships. It is arguable that tire crumb in applications such as basketball courts could be better described as [...] "reused" [...] rubber rather than [...] "recycled".|$|E

40|$|If posed a {{question}} to our society these days about what is recyclable? Sure many are able to answer it.

40|$|Plastic <b>recycling</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of {{recovering}} scrap or waste plastics and reprocessing the material into useful products that sometimes differ completely in form from their original state. An important issue in plastic recovery and recycling is that plastic waste usually contains {{a variety of}} plastics that differ in their physical and chemical properties. Separation of recovered plastics into distinct classes is a fundamental prerequisite for their use as secondary raw materials. The Multidune separator is a hydraulic channel that permits solid particle sorting {{on the basis of}} differential transport mechanisms. Steady flow conditions are established within the apparatus. An image analysis technique was employed to reconstruct the trajectories of tracer particles within the fluid and to determine the evolution of the velocity field with time. Pollen and plastic particles Were used as tracers. Unlike plastic particles, pollen is expected to passively follow the fluid flow field. Tests on monomaterial and composite samples were conducted while varying the operative conditions, and comparisons were made. The presence of three different recirculation areas occurred regardless of the hydraulic head at the Multidune inlet except for the first and last chambers. The lower recirculation zone is larger than the upper recirculation zone because of geometrical constraints. With variation in the hydraulic head, the geometry of the inner structures does not change appreciably. if a plastic particle within the principal transport path interacts with the lower recirculation area and its physical characteristics (density and dimensions) are such that it remains trapped, the separation process is successful. Because of its smaller dimensions and the reduced value of its velocity field, the upper recirculation area is relatively ineffective in the separation process...|$|E
