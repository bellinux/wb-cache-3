40|$|Background. Severe {{anterior}} post-burn contracture (PBC) of {{the neck}} poses the anaesthesiologist some difficult problems and results in difficult intubation when extension of the atlanto-occipital joint is impaired. Such patients must therefore have the PBC scar released before other procedures are performed, {{in order to ensure}} airway control. 					Objectives. To show our experience with quick surgical neck release of patients with severe anterior PBC {{of the neck}} to facilitate direct laryngoscopy and orotracheal intubation (OTI). 					Material and methods. A prospective study of patients with severe anterior PBC of the neck was carried out from January 2003 to December 2007 in the Burns Unit of Mosul Teaching Hospital in Mosul, Iraq. The patients were given ketamine, after which a <b>release</b> <b>incision</b> was made over the anterior PBC of the neck scar. OTI was then performed successfully. 					Results.

30|$|It is {{well know}} that primary closure is {{increasing}} the clinical {{outcome of the}} GBR procedures [6]. To overcome membrane exposure, {{it has been suggested}} to perform a periosteal <b>releasing</b> <b>incision</b> [13]. However, periosteal <b>releasing</b> <b>incisions</b> might cause more swelling, bleeding, and patient discomfort. Importantly, they also may compromise blood circulation [14], and re-positioning flap coronally can result in a misaligned mucogingival line (MGL) if not properly performed [13]. This misaligned MGL might also cause esthetic problems especially in the anterior regions. Therefore, the use of resorbable membrane in the patients might be beneficial, especially in patients with thin soft tissue biotypes.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Deltoid {{contracture}} is {{not uncommon}} in India. Contractures of deltoid often do not have definite etiology. We have critically analyzed the condition as regards the etiopathogenesis and its surgical results. Materials and Methods: Nineteen patients with deltoid contracture operated between June 1990 and September 2001 were enrolled for a unicentric retrospective study. The surgery was indicated in patients with abduction deformity of more than 30 &#x 00 B 0; at the shoulder. The etiology of deltoid contracture was idiopathic (n = 13) intramuscular injection in deltoid muscle (n = 5) and blunt trauma (n = 1). All were operated by distal <b>release</b> (<b>incision</b> near the insertion of the deltoid muscle). The average follow-up was of 9. 5 years (range 6 - 17 years). They were evaluated based on parameters like pain, persistence of deformity, range of shoulder movements and strength of deltoid. Results: All patients recovered painless full range of shoulder motion except one. The correction of deformity was achieved in all patients {{and there was no}} loss of strength of deltoid compared to the opposite side. Histology of excised tissue showed features of chronic inflammation. The complications observed were hypertrophic scar (n = 1), painful terminal restriction of shoulder movements (n = 1) and prominent vertebral border of scapula (n = 1). Conclusion: Deltoid contracture has features of chronic inflammation, and the intramuscular deltoid injection is the most incriminating factor in its etiopathogenesis. The condition can be effectively managed surgically by distal release of the deltoid muscle combined with excision of the muscular fibrotic contracture band...|$|E

30|$|Surgery for bone {{augmentation}} and implant placement {{was performed}} under local anesthesia with Ultracain forte (Sanofi Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany) following a standard operation protocol. In the augmentation procedure, a crestal incision in the attached gingiva of the edentulous alveolar crest with one vertical <b>releasing</b> <b>incision</b> was used, after mobilization of the mucoperiosteal flap an autologous retromolar bone block was {{fixed on the}} occlusal part of the alveolar ridge. The bone block was secured with a microscrew (Modus 1.5, Medartis, Umkirch, Germany) {{and covered with a}} resorbable membrane (BioGide, Geistlich AG, Switzerland) as described previously [29]. The passively mobilized mucosa was closed with a running suture and secured with interrupted sutures (5 - 0 Monocryl, Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany).|$|R
30|$|Since the {{practice}} of conventional autopsy, one new method for skin incision as “fourth incision” {{has been added to}} the preexisting conventional methods of skin incisions, i.e., “I”/“Y”/modified “Y”.

This study was formulated to develop a new course of skin incision for autopsy with the aim to minimize the visible defect and to obviate the need of extra incisions and so that it is time friendly for autopsy surgeons.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Femoral hernias {{frequently}} {{present with}} incarceration, resulting in obstruction and strangulation. Laparoscopic groin hernia repairs {{have been shown}} in the elective setting {{to be an effective}} alternative to open repair. Acute incarceration of groin hernia with obstruction, though previously seen as a relative contraindication, has been increasingly repaired with minimally invasive techniques, with the potential benefit of avoiding the morbidity associated with a laparotomy. Presentation of case and discussion: We describe a case of an acutely incarcerated femoral hernia with intestinal obstruction that was repaired using the totally extra-peritoneal approach. A <b>releasing</b> <b>incision</b> was performed to facilitate reduction of hernia prior to mesh repair. Diagnostic laparoscopy through a separate incision was then performed.

30|$|The widely practiced {{conventional}} {{methods for}} skin incision {{to be made}} during autopsy process have been discussed in books devoted to forensic pathology. But while adopting one of the conventional methods of skin incision, separate incisions are invariably required {{for the assessment of}} soft tissue injury on the back and to open the spinal canal during autopsy. Further additional confirmatory (for differentiating bruise from hypostasis) or <b>releasing</b> <b>incisions</b> are required for complete exposure of the front of the neck (i.e., along the inferior border of the lower jaw and over the collar bones) and pelvic cavity (i.e., along the course of inguinal ligaments). On reconstitution of the dead body, sutured conventional incision on the front aspect of the body along with additional incisions leads to the visible artifacts over the skin surface, i.e., apparent disfigurement (mutilation) of the dead body. Therefore, these incisions are cosmetically ineffective and scare the legal heirs of the dead body.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{provide a}} {{narrative}} {{review of the}} current literature elaborating on fundamental principles of periodontal plastic surgical procedures. METHODS: Based on a presumptive outline of the narrative review, MESH terms {{have been used to}} search the relevant literature electronically in the PubMed and Cochrane Collaboration databases. If possible, systematic reviews were included. The review is divided into three phases associated with periodontal plastic surgery: a) pre-operative phase, b) surgical procedures and c) post-surgical care. The surgical procedures were discussed in the light of a) flap design and preparation, b) flap mobilization and c) flap adaptation and stabilization. RESULTS: Pre-operative paradigms include the optimal plaque control and smoking counselling. Fundamental principles in surgical procedures address basic knowledge in anatomy and vascularity, leading to novel appropriate flap designs with papilla preservation. Flap mobilization based on <b>releasing</b> <b>incisions</b> can be performed up to 5 mm. Flap adaptation and stabilization depend on appropriate wound bed characteristics, undisturbed blood clot formation, revascularization and wound stability through adequate suturing.

30|$|A midcrestal {{incision}} {{was made}} with vertical <b>release</b> <b>incisions</b> at the canine and tuberosity region. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was elevated. The lateral maxillary sinus wall was prepared using a diamond burr with copious irrigation with sterile isotonic saline, regarding the contour of the maxillary sinus as observed on the preoperative panoramic radiograph. A bony top-hinge trap-door was mobilized and turned inward and upward into a horizontal position in the maxillary sinus, together with the carefully elevated Schneiderian membrane. The area created between the lifted lid and the sinus floor was filled only with BCP (Straumann® Bone Ceramic). The BCP was 100 % crystalline, highly pure, and had a porosity of 90 %. The pores were 100 to 500  μm in diameter. No membrane was used to cover the lateral window [36]. Primary wound closure was performed with Gore-Tex® sutures (W.L. Gore & Associates, Newark, DE, USA). Immediately after the procedure, a panoramic radiograph was made. Postoperative examination and removal of the sutures were performed 10 to 14  days after the MSFE procedure.|$|R
30|$|In this technique, {{a broad-based}} {{trapezoid}} mucoperiosteal flap is created after excising the epithelialized margins and giving two vertical <b>release</b> <b>incisions</b> {{to develop a}} flap with adequate dimensions to be sutured over the defect. Its broad base enables a better blood supply to the flap. Flap coverage is improved by horizontal periosteal incisions. Falci et al. described a modification of this technique for OAF closure. The mucosal margins of the fistula were sutured together prior to {{the reflection of the}} buccal flap. Then, the buccal flap was pulled over this sutured site and tucked under the palatal flap, which was elevated simultaneously with the buccal flap [13]. Killey, in 1972, studied 362 cases using this technique. The results revealed success in 336 (93 %) cases [5]. However, the potential disadvantage of using this flap for OAF closure is the reduction of buccal sulcus, which makes it difficult to use prosthesis in the future [1]. Other disadvantages include postoperative pain and swelling {{as a result of the}} reflection of a mucoperiosteal flap. Currently, a reduction in the buccal sulcus can be overcome by implant-retained overdentures.|$|R
30|$|Only {{a limited}} number of {{articles}} have been published in peri-implant dehiscence coverage [1, 2]. Most of the cases involved autogenous mucosal graft. A conventional CPF using vertical <b>releasing</b> <b>incisions</b> (VRIs) in combination with SCTG has been considered to be a major treatment option in peri-implant dehiscence coverage. However, VRIs have risks with esthetic disturbance and post-operative course. Therefore, we previously reported a technique with coronary positioned envelope flap using SCTG [8]. The CPF with envelope technique has the advantages of increasing keratinized mucosa, a better post-operative course, and a more positive esthetic evaluation such as scars after healing than CPF with VRIs [9]. In contrast, coronary positioning of flap is difficult in cases with scarring recipient mucosa and multi-implant recession due to less flap mobility. In such cases, additional semilunar incision is useful in improving the flap mobility. Coronary-anchored suture (CAS) facilitates to make space for insertion of connective tissue and to fix the position of CPF. Since reduction of micromotion during healing period influences graft survival, CAS may be useful in envelope and tunneling techniques. Further studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of this technique.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} randomized, controlled, {{clinical}} study was to compare two surgical techniques with the acellular dermal matrix graft (ADMG) to evaluate which technique could provide better root coverage.

In each patient, one recession area was randomly assigned to the control group, while the contra-lateral recession area {{was assigned to the}} test group. The ADMG was used in both groups. The control group was treated with a broader flap and vertical-releasing incisions, and the test group was treated with the proposed surgical technique, without <b>releasing</b> <b>incisions.</b> The clinical parameters evaluated before the surgeries and after 12 months were: gingival recession height, probing depth, relative clinical attachment level and the width and thickness of keratinized tissue. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for all parameters at baseline. After 12 months, there was a statistically significant reduction in recession height in both groups, and there was no statistically significant difference between the techniques with regard to root coverage.

MATERIAL & METHODS: Four hundred and sixty-eight healthy dental patients requiring surgeries, such as crown lengthening (CL), open flap debridement (OFD) and implant installation (IMP) in the National Dental Centre, Singapore (2009 - 2011), were consecutively recruited. PROMs on bleeding, swelling, pain and bruising were obtained using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) on days 0, 3, 5 and 7 post-operatively. RESULTS: On the day of surgery, the IMP procedure gave the lowest median VAS for all four PROM parameters. After a week, OFD still had a significantly higher VAS for swelling, pain and bruising. Patients who underwent procedures lasting more than 60  min. had higher VAS for all parameters except bleeding. After considering other important confounders, type of surgery procedure was no longer associated with the VAS score {{for any of the}} parameters. Time after surgery, male gender and shorter surgery duration reduced post-operative VAS for {{one or more of the}} parameters. Longer surgeon experience helps reduce VAS scores only for bleeding.

40|$|AIM:To {{compare the}} {{differences}} of visual acuity and corneal astigmatism postoperatively between conventional refractive cataract surgery and that assisted by femtosecond laser. METHODS:Sixty patients(60 eyes) with age-related cataract and cornea astigmatism {{were divided into}} femtosecond group and conventional group randomly or voluntarily. The flat shaft, steep shaft and diopter of corneal astigmatism in patients in femtosecond group were inputted into the online vector calculators to get the location and width of the incision. Then femtosecond laser was used to make corneal <b>releasing</b> <b>incision,</b> the main and auxiliary incision. Phacoemulsification and aspheric multifocal intraocular lens implantation were undergone. Patients in conventional group received full-thickness relaxing incision by cornea paracentesis knife at the steepest meridian axis during phacoemulsification. Then aspheric multifocal intraocular lenses were implanted. Uncorrected distance visual acuity(UCDVA), uncorrected near visual acuity(UCNVA) and cornea astigmatism were observed at 1 d, 1 wk and 1 mo postoperative. RESULTS:UCVA of patients in both groups was improved after the surgeries. UCDVA and UCNVA of femtosecond group were {{higher than those of}} conventional group, while the cornea astigmatism of femtosecond group was lower than that of conventional group.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{periodontal}} tissues heal faster that skin, and gingiva in particular heal without scar formation. The mechanisms regulating this behavior are still unclear. The aim of our work is to compare wound healing in oral mucosa and gingiva, investigating the role of αSMA-expressing myofibroblasts and autophagy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsies were obtained from 7 patients immediately before and 24 h after vertical <b>releasing</b> <b>incision</b> in oral mucosa and attached gingiva. Both whole biopsies and primary cultures of fibroblasts derived from the same tissues were subjected to immunofluorescence, Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. RESULTS: We demonstrated that in oral mucosa, characterized by partially fibrotic outcome during repair, the activation of autophagy determined an increase in αSMA and collagen 1 a 1 production. Conversely, wound healing did not stimulate autophagy in attached gingiva, and subsequently no increase in myofibroblast differentiation and collagen deposition could be seen, thus justifying its scareless outcome. CONCLUSION: The elucidation of the differential regulation of autophagy in periodontal tissues and its correlation with myofibroblast differentiation and fibrotic outcome could allow the identification of new molecules involved in periodontal healing {{and the development of}} new surgical approaches for periodontal treatment that could improve the outcome of postoperative wounds...|$|R

Twelve patients made up of 7 males and 5 females were seen. The age at presentation ranged from nine days to 5 years {{with a mean age of}} 12. 9 months. Nineteen limbs were affected, made up of four right upper limbs, six left upper limbs, six right lower limbs and three left lower limbs. In the upper limb malformations involved total 36 digits, arm in one case and forearm in one case; in the lower limb malformations involved total 27 toes, foot in one and leg in four cases. Types of lesions which were found: constriction rings, intrauterine amputations, simple syndactyly. Results: Treatment options ranged from observation to multi-staged operations. Surgical correction of the constriction ring was done by excision and w-plasty to prevent or alleviate lymphoedema, multiple <b>release</b> <b>incisions</b> over distal limb to reduce the edema.

40|$|Objective. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate two different surgical techniques using Allograft Tissue Matrix (ATM) to obtain root coverage. Background. ATM has been utilized as an alternative to autogenous soft tissue grafting to cover exposed roots on teeth. Methods. ATM was utilized to treat 2 consecutive patients that presented with gingival recession of the mandibular incisors. Full thickness mucoperiosteal flaps were reflected and apical <b>releasing</b> <b>incisions</b> were used to mobilize and coronally advance the flaps. ATM was prepared and adapted to the recipient site {{at the level of the}} cemento-enamel junction. In the control case the ATM was completely covered by the flap whereas in the test case the ATM was left partially exposed. Gingival recession and the amount of keratinized tissue were measured at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 30 weeks post operatively. Results. Gingival recession was reduced in both control and test. In the control case complete root coverage was obtained, and a 3 mm zone of keratinized tissue free of inflammation was present at 8 weeks. In the test case, the gingival defect was narrowed but not eliminated, but an increase in the amount of keratinized tissue was noted. Conclusion. Complete coverage of the ATM provided the graft with an adequate blood supply which facilitated healing. Partial coverage of the material did not provide an adequate blood supply and is not recommended. Due to its avascular nature, this grafting material requires complete coverage with a vascularized flap during healing...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The scope was {{to review}} the three main {{clinical}} indications in periodontal plastic surgical procedures. AIMS: To review the fundamental principles in periodontal plastic surgery, the main surgical designs in flap surgery applied {{to the treatment of}} recessions, peri-implant soft tissue deficiencies and soft tissue ridge augmentation, as well as the surgical principles of using autologous connective tissue grafts and soft tissue substitutes. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES IN PLASTIC SURGERY: In the pre-operative phase, the key elements are the control of prognostic factors affecting the patient, namely oral hygiene, tobacco smoking cessation and systemic disease control. In the operative phase, the principles of flap design, mobilization, advancement, adaptation and stabilization. In the post-operative phase infection control, including effective oral hygiene measures, antiseptic treatment and other medications. CRITICAL ELEMENTS IN FLAP DESIGN AND SURGICAL EXECUTION: In single recession defects, the most widely used flap technique is the coronally advanced flap and in specific clinical situations the laterally positioned flap. In multiple recession defects, the number of defects and their location and depth guide the surgical design, being one design with and the other without vertical <b>releasing</b> <b>incisions.</b> When flaps are used in combination with grafts the tunnel flap is also used extensively. CRITICAL ELEMENTS IN THE USE OF SOFT TISSUE REPLACEMENT GRAFTS: The key elements are the donor site selection and harvesting technique, its tissue integration and volume stability.

30|$|Within 1  month before {{surgical}} treatment, {{all patients}} received extensive oral hygiene instructions and mechanical non-surgical debridement of implants and remaining dentition using hand instrumentation and/or an ultrasonic device. Immediately before surgical treatment screw-retained suprastructures were removed. In {{order to obtain}} an optimal overview of the peri-implant area during surgery, prior to the procedure, only screw-retained suprastructures were removed. Cemented single crowns or bridges on mesostructures were left in place to prevent any damage to these structures. Directly after surgery, the screw-retained suprastructures were placed back. Cemented single crowns or bridges on mesostructures were left in place to prevent any damage to these structures. Vertical <b>releasing</b> <b>incisions</b> extending into the alveolar mucosa were placed using a surgical blade (no. 15), and full thickness mucoperiosteal flaps were raised buccally and lingually. Flaps were designed to allow optimal access to the peri-implant bone defect. Granulation tissue was removed using titanium curettes (Gracey; Hu-Friedy®, Chicago, IL, USA). The implant surfaces were mechanically cleaned using titanium curettes and gauzes and cotton pellets soaked in saline. Next, the patients were randomly allocated to either the test or control group. Subsequently, implants were cleaned with either local application of 35 % phosphoric acid gel (pH  1) for 1  min (Temrex gel, Temrex, Freeport, NY, USA) (test group) or by rinsing with an abundant amount of sterile saline for 1  min (control group). Care was taken to apply the phosphoric etching gel precisely on the implant surface using a syringe with a small tip. During 1  min, the etching gel was continuously rubbed on to the implant surface with a small brush. In both groups, the intervention continued with rinsing of the implant surface with an abundant amount of sterile saline for 1  min.|$|R

Material and methods: A cross-sectional study in patients who had been treated by two periodontists and two prosthodontists in 2006 and 2007 was conducted. Surgical treatment involved standard flap elevation without <b>releasing</b> <b>incisions</b> and restorative procedures included cemented crowns in all patients. Only straightforward single implant treatments in healing sites (6 – 8 weeks following tooth extraction) and fully-healed sites (≥ 6 months following tooth extraction) were considered with both neighbouring teeth present and without the need for hard and/or soft tissue grafting. Clinical and radiographical analyses of all implants were performed by a blinded clinician who had not been involved in the treatment. Results: 49 / 53 eligible single implants (22 early and 27 conventionally placed implants) in 44 / 48 patients were available for scrutiny. There was no statistically significant difference in implant survival between early (95 %) and conventionally (93 %) installed implants (p = 1. 000). Mean bone level to the implant-abutment interface was 1. 25 mm and 1. 02 mm for early, respectively conventional implant placement (p = 0. 220). In spite of fairly low plaque levels (26 %), overall peri-implant bleeding was quite prevalent (36 %). Mean peri-implant probing depth was 3. 3 mm. 5 restorations had experienced technical complications. Conclusions: Single Nobelreplace tapered TiUnite® implants installed in healing as well as in healed sites of the anterior maxilla are predictable. Both strategies seem equally successful in terms of implant survival, bone remodelling, clinical response and risk for complications...|$|R

40|$|Background: Wound closure is {{accomplished}} {{in most cases}} of myelomeningocele (MMC) by undermining of the skin edges surrounding the defect. However, large defects cannot be closed reliably by this simple technique. Due to the technical challenge associated with large MMC, surgeons have devised different methods for repairing large defects. In this paper, we report our experience of managing large defects, which we believe bears a direct relationship to decrease the incidence of wound complications. Materials and Methods: Forty children with large MMCs underwent surgical repair and represent our experience. We recommend using all hairy skin around the defect {{as a way to}} decrease the tension on the edges of the wound and the possible subsequent necrosis. It is our experience that vertical incision on one or two flanks parallel to the midline can decrease the tension of the wound. Moreover, ventriculo-peritoneal shunting for children who developed hydrocephalus was performed simultaneously, which constitutes another recommendation for preventing fluid collection and build up of pressure on the wound. Results: Patients in this study were in the age range of 2 days to 8 years. The most common location of MMC was in the thoracolumbar area. All but four patients had severe weakness in lower extremities. We used as much hairy skin around the MMC sac as possible in all cases. Vertical incisions on one or both flanks and simultaneous shunt procedure were performed in 36 patients. We treated children with large MMC defects with acceptable tension-free closure. Nonetheless, three patients developed superficial skin infection and partial wound dehiscence, and they were managed conservatively. Conclusions: We recommend using all hairy skin around the MMC defect for closure of large defects. In cases that were expected to be at a higher risk to develop dehiscence <b>release</b> <b>incisions</b> on one or two flanks towards the fascia were found to be useful. Simultaneous ventriculo-peritoneal shunting is also recommended in this cohort of patients, according to our experience. These recommendations neither prolong the time of surgery nor increase the cost, but facilitate a successful closure...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study in patients who had been treated by two periodontists and two prosthodontists in 2006 and 2007 was conducted. Surgical treatment involved standard flap elevation without <b>releasing</b> <b>incisions</b> and restorative procedures included cemented crowns in all patients. Only straightforward single implant treatments using Nobelreplace tapered TiUnite® implants (Nobel Biocare, Göteborg, Sweden) in healing sites (6 – 8 weeks following tooth extraction) and fully healed sites (36 months following tooth extraction) were considered with both neighboring teeth present and {{without the need for}} hard and/or soft tissue grafting. The aesthetic outcome was objectively rated using the pink esthetic score (PES) and white esthetic scrore (WES) by a blinded clinician who had not been involved in the treatment. Patients rated aesthetics by means of visual analogue scales. Results: Twenty-one out of 22 early and 25 / 27 conventional implant treatments were available for aesthetic evaluation after on average {{two and a half years}} of function (range 17 – 41 months). There were no significant differences for any of the criteria between the treatment concepts. Overall, papillae were most easy to satisfy,whereas alveolar process and tooth color most difficult. A thin-scalloped biotype was associated with low distal papillae (p =. 041) and alveolar process deficiency (p =. 039). Twenty-six percent of the cases were aesthetic failures (PES < 8 and/orWES < 6) and 13 % showed an (almost) perfect outcome (PES 3 12 and WES 3 9). The remainder (61 %) demonstrated acceptable aesthetics. There was no significant correlation between objective and subjective ratings. Conclusions: Early and conventional single implant treatment yielded comparable aesthetic outcome. Albeit all treatments had been performed by experienced clinicians and only straightforward cases had been selected, 1 out of 4 cases were aesthetic failures and only a strict minority showed perfection. Research is required on the aesthetic outcome of alternative surgical procedures especially in high-risk patients with a thin-scalloped biotype...|$|R
40|$|The Indus {{drainage}} {{has experienced}} major variations in climate since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) that {{have affected the}} volumes and compositions of the sediment reaching the ocean since that time. We here present a comprehensive first-order source-to-sink budget spanning the time since the LGM. We show that buffering of sediment in the floodplain accounts for ca. 20 - 25 % of the mass flux. Sedimentation rates have varied greatly and must have been on average three times the recent, predamming rates. Much of the sediment was <b>released</b> by <b>incision</b> of fluvial terraces constructed behind landslide dams within the mountains, and especially along the major river valleys. New bedrock erosion is estimated to supply around 45 % of the sedimentation. Around 50 % of deposited sediment lies under the southern floodplains, with 50 % offshore in large shelf clinoforms. Provenance indicators show a change of erosional focus during the Early Holocene, but {{no change in the}} Mid-Late Holocene because of further reworking from the floodplains. While suspended loads travel rapidly from source-to-sink, zircon grains in the bedload show travel times of 7 - 14 kyr. The largest lag times are anticipated in the Indus submarine fan where sedimentation lags erosion by at least 10 kyr.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} conditions associated with compartment syndrome development in prehospital care. Pressure increase {{in a closed}} anatomical space is characteristic for this condition, leading to circulation and neural sensitivity affection in the specified area. In the prehospital care, we may meet with the compartment syndrome in fractures, burns, allergic reactions, traumas caused by an accident, electrotraumas; further in crush syndrome, traffic accidents, craniocerebral injuries and other conditions associated with swelling. This thesis focuses on burns, fractures, electrotraumas, intra-abdominal hypertension and conditions caused by snake bite. Inconsiderate or inadequate manipulation with affected patient may worsen his/her condition and lead to deterioration of his/her health condition or even fatal consequences. The aim of this thesis was to map the theoretical and practical knowledge of non-medical health care professionals working in prehospital care, in treatment of conditions able to delay compartment syndrome development or even to accelerate it. Data collection for the research was performed using questionnaires and semistandardised interviews. Questionnaires were filled by 20 randomly chosen respondents. 12 respondents were interviewed. Correct answers evaluation is listed in the tables in the practical part of this thesis. Interviews transcript {{is a part of}} the practical part as well, with colour coded correct and incorrect information provided by the interviewed medical rescuers. A sample test and list of posed questions with sub-questions are included in the attachment. Both parts of the research were performed with medical rescuers and general medicine nurses working at medical rescue services of southbohemian region and the region of Vysočina. The research found that the term of compartment syndrome is well known by medical rescuers and general nurses working at medical rescue services. However, they are not aware of its association with prehospital care. In some cases, the answers of the responders differed significantly, as for treatment of acute conditions associated with this problem, from the recommended procedures according to the literature. Furthermore, the research analysed the type and amount of used fluids in pre-hospital care. This question showed interesting findings as well. Lastly, the research analysed the options of acute fasciotomy in circular neck burns in prehospital care. The respondents interpreted this procedure as life-saving, as this condition is life-threatening for patients and quick transport without <b>releasing</b> <b>incisions</b> is very risky. It is a procedure that should be known to medical rescuers, at least at the theoretical level, and considered life-saving, even if they do not have sufficient competences to perform it. Respondents showed interest and effort for deepening of their knowledge about this procedure during the research. This situation may be improved by additional training in traumatology, surgery and intensive care not only in medical rescuers working in medical rescue services, but in students of these specialisations as well. This thesis could be a base for deeper investigation of this topic, currently insufficiently known; furthermore, for increasing specialised knowledge of medical rescuers in treatment of oedematous conditions and increasing of health care quality in prehospital acute care...|$|R
40|$|Chinese {{complementary}} therapy for stress causing bilateral chemical burns to the feet A 23 -year-old Chinese woman {{presented to the}} emergency department with painful blisters on the soles of her feet. History revealed that, following advice from her mother, she had applied crushed raw garlic to the areas for 3 h that afternoon while revising for an exam. Examination found bilateral, large tense blisters with exqui-sitely tender surrounding erythema (see figure 1). <b>Incision</b> <b>released</b> a quantity of pungent smelling serous fluid. A diagnosis of chemical burn was made, and the patient was discharged with analgesia and dermatology follow-up. Historically, garlic has been used medicinally {{in the treatment of}} small pox, pulmonary tuberculosis and gangrene. More diverse uses have included warding off demons, the quest for immortality and remedying stress. In more recent times, cardiovascular benefits have been demonstrated. Adverse effects of garlic include diarrhoea; drug interactions (eg, with warfarin and insulin); botulism; burns and halitosis. ...|$|R
