There are {{numerous}} tracks on the island, {{where it is}} possible to <b>ride</b> <b>a</b> <b>bike,</b> go for a walk, or go jogging. Apart from Ada, Belgrade has total of 16 islands on the rivers, many still unused. Among them, the Great War Island, at the confluence of Sava, stands out as an oasis of unshattered wildlife (especially birds). These areas, along with nearby Small War Island, are protected by the city's government as a nature preserve.|$|E

He accepts the offer but trips {{on his way back}} to Vader and falls anyway.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{consciousness}} {{can refer to}} voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behaviour involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes {{take place in the}} cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviours are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they <b>ride</b> <b>a</b> <b>bike,</b> but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so.|$|E

25|$|Goal-setting {{theory is}} based on the notion that {{individuals}} sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state. Often, this end state is a reward in itself. A goal's efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty and specificity. One common goal setting methodology incorporates the SMART criteria, in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and time-bound. An ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close. This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to <b>ride</b> <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> than to master algebra. A goal should be moderate, not too hard or too easy to complete. In both cases, most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success). At the same time people want to feel that there is a substantial probability that they will succeed. Specificity concerns the description of the goal in their class. The goal should be objectively defined and intelligible for the individual. A classic example of a poorly specified goal is to get the highest possible grade. Most children have no idea how much effort they need to reach that goal.|$|E

2500|$|... "Activity-based" [...] {{means that}} {{for people to}} learn, a real object has to be {{actually}} present; as Jacinta Correia puts it: [...] "{{to learn how to}} <b>ride</b> <b>a</b> <b>bike,</b> you need a bike to ride on". Thus, for a large group to learn how to manage a complex enterprise, it has to have a complex enterprise to manage. In the OW context, this means that a group averaging 150, many of whom often with lower levels of education, are actively engaged, for an entire month, in (a) productive or service provision enterprise(s). For all the apparent, e.g., on-the-job training and action learning parallels, the OW's defining features are not only the need for a cooperative large group and the creation of (a) complex, real enterprise(s), but, principally, the position of the trainer {{and the way in which}} training messages are communicated. In OW-learning, the trainer's role is merely subsidiary (known as [...] "scaffolding" [...] in activity theory). In other words, it is not the trainer/instructor, but [...] "the object that teaches".|$|E
2500|$|Constable Karen Pelly (Tara Spencer-Nairn) is Dog River's ambitious, {{sometimes}} neurotic junior police officer. Before {{becoming a}} police officer, she ranked fifth in Canada {{in the sport}} of static apnea, with a personal best of more than six minutes. She's a very good cook, but does not like {{to bring it up}} for fear it will stereotype her. She does not want to admit that she does not know how to <b>ride</b> <b>a</b> <b>bike.</b> She is also at least 10 years younger than most of the other characters, turning 30 in the sixth season. Karen possesses a variety of skills including cooking, martial arts, drums, drawing, and table hockey; but when she wins a raffle in the sixth season, she says it's the first time she ever won anything. She tends to take her police position very seriously, unlike her partner Davis, and treats even the most minor problem officially. On one occasion, when she mentions to Davis that she feels she has a good lead on a cold case, he stares at her dumbfounded and asks [...] "Why?" [...] Karen frequently becomes annoyed with Davis' willingness to obey the mayor in everything and bend rules. They differ greatly on their views of what a police officer should portray; on one occasion, Karen states that [...] "a police officer should be respected by the community", to which Davis casually replies [...] "Who said that?" [...] Many episodes see them engaged in petty disputes and going to great lengths to one-up each other. Despite their differences, Karen and Davis get along well although they don't spend much time together outside of work. In the episode [...] "Hook, Line and Sinker" [...] Karen goes fishing with Hank and is seduced by his [...] "sexy fish talk". After the end of the series, she falls in love and marries; in , Karen's husband {{is said to be a}} soldier stationed off the Mediterranean coast, and they are expecting their first child.|$|E
