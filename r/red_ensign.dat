5|$|The <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign</b> of Singapore {{is a civil}} ensign used by privately owned, non-military {{ships that}} are {{registered}} in Singapore. The overall design of the ensign is a modification of the national flag, with {{the ratio of the}} width to the length extended to 1:2. The ensign was created by law in 1966. The use of this ensign is regulated by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). According to the MPA, the <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign</b> is the only ensign to be used on Singaporean civilian ships, and the national flag is not an acceptable substitute. The ensign must be hoisted on all Singaporean ships on entering or leaving port.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Canadian Confederation in 1867, {{the need}} for {{distinctive}} Canadian flags emerged. The first Canadian flag was that then used as {{the flag of the}} Governor General of Canada, a Union Flag with a shield in the centre bearing the quartered arms of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick surrounded by a wreath of maple leaves. In 1870 the <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign,</b> with the addition of the Canadian composite shield in the fly, began to be used unofficially on land and sea and was known as the Canadian <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign.</b> As new provinces joined the Confederation, their arms were added to the shield. In 1892, the British admiralty approved the use of the <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign</b> for Canadian use at sea. The composite shield was replaced with the coat of arms of Canada upon its grant in 1921 and, in 1924, an Order in Council approved its use for Canadian government buildings abroad. In 1925, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King established a committee to design a flag to be used at home, but it was dissolved before the final report could be delivered. Despite the failure of the committee to solve the issue, public sentiment in the 1920s was in favour of fixing the flag problem for Canada. New designs were proposed in 1927, 1931, and 1939.|$|E

5|$|The Belfast Steamship Company's MV Munster which {{operated}} the Belfast to Liverpool route, (both British ports) flew the tricolour. But, no flag was a protection against mines; Munster struck a mine approaching Liverpool and sank. There were over 200 passengers and 50 crew on board. A {{few hours later}} they were all rescued by the collier Ringwall. Four were injured; and one died later. The L ferries Cambria, Hibernia and Scotia were Irish-registered and sailed between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead, under the <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign.</b> Their British crews were taken aback when the tricolour was hoisted. They went on strike and refused to sail until the ships were transferred to the British registry and <b>red</b> <b>ensign</b> was restored.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Ireland declared neutrality. There were a total of 56 Irish ships at {{the outbreak}} of World War II; 15 more were purchased or leased in the conflict, and 16 were lost. Up to then most Irish-registered ships had been flying the <b>red</b> <b>ensign</b> of the United Kingdom Merchant Navy. All were required by UK law to fly the <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign,</b> but some, such as the Wexford Steamship Company ships, had always travelled under the tricolour. With {{the outbreak of}} hostilities, choices were forced. The Irish government ordered all Irish ships to fly the tricolour. Some British ships were on the Irish register, such as the whalers which were Scottish-owned (Christian Salvesen Shipping) but Irish-registered in order {{to take advantage of the}} Irish whale quota. The six whale catchers and the two factory ships were pressed into British naval service, after their owners transferred them to the British registry. Some ships which could be described as British also choose the Tricolour. Kerrymore, which was registered as belonging to R McGowan of Tralee, was actually owned by Kelly Colliers of Belfast. Most of the crew had addresses in loyalist areas of Belfast. For six years they sailed under the tricolour.|$|E

Wolter also claimed he had personally discussed the matter with some three hundred people, most of whom expressed their support for his initiative. On the other hand, many national politicians (including leading members of Wolter's own CSV) and VIPs have expressed astonishment in the local media concerning both the timing and necessity for such a change.

5|$|By the 1960s, {{debate for}} an {{official}} Canadian flag intensified {{and became a}} subject of controversy, culminating in the Great Flag Debate of 1964. In 1963, the minority Liberal government of Lester B. Pearson gained power and decided to adopt an official Canadian flag through parliamentary debate. The principal political proponent of the change was Pearson. He had been a significant broker during the Suez Crisis of 1956, {{for which he was}} awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. During the crisis, Pearson was disturbed when the Egyptian government objected to Canadian peacekeeping forces {{on the grounds that the}} Canadian flag (the <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign)</b> contained the same symbol (the Union Flag) also used as a flag by the United Kingdom, one of the belligerents. Pearson's goal was for the Canadian flag to be distinctive and unmistakably Canadian. The main opponent to changing the flag was the leader of the opposition and former prime minister, John Diefenbaker, who eventually made the subject a personal crusade.|$|E
5|$|Before 1928 {{the only}} flag that had {{official}} {{status in the}} Union of South Africa was the United Kingdom's Union Jack as South Africa {{was part of the}} British Empire. The South Africa <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign</b> was used as an unofficial flag. In 1925, discussion rose about creating a new flag for South Africa as many descendants of Boers found the Union Jack unacceptable after the Boer War. In 1926 the Balfour Declaration granted South Africa legislative autonomy, opening the possibility of a new flag. British settlers wanted the Union Jack in the new flag as part of the British Empire while the Afrikaners did not. A compromise was reached whereby the new flag would consist of the Prince's Flag as this was the first flag raised on South Africa and a badge of the Union Jack in the centre with the flags of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The Union Jack was mirrored in the new flag with the hoist on the right so that it did not take precedence over the others.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Confederation in 1867, the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom {{served in}} Canada as {{the symbol of}} royal authority. Arms had not been granted {{to any of the}} colonies in British North America, apart from 17th-century grants to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. The year after Confederation, arms were granted by Royal Warrant on May 26, 1868 to Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia (that Nova Scotia had been granted arms was forgotten, and it took until 1929 for the {{historic}} arms granted in the 17th century to be reinstated) and New Brunswick. In the Royal Warrant of 1868, Queen Victoria authorized the four arms of the first provinces to be quartered for use on the Great Seal of Canada and while this was not done for the first Great Seal, it is through this reference it became the de facto arms for Canada until 1921. That is why it was in this form Canada was represented on the first <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign</b> carried by Canadian troops at Vimy Ridge in 1917.|$|E

The blasts ceased at the funnel, and as the slackening couplings clashed while the cars rolled slowly through the eddying dust I started in amaze, for there were two faces at the unglazed windows of the decorated observation car which I knew well, but had never expected to see there. Martin Lorimer waved his hand toward me as the train stopped, my cousin Alice stood beside him smiling a greeting, and with shame I remembered how long it was since I had sent news to her.|$|R
5000|$|Most New England flags {{were based}} on the <b>red</b> naval <b>ensign</b> or blue naval ensign of the Royal Navy, which {{featured}} the cross of St. George in the canton. The ensign was used at both the Jamestown and Plymouth colonies. Puritans in New England, led by Roger Williams, objected to the use of a Christian cross on their flag, and for a time flew a red flag with a plain white canton. [...] The new flag first appeared in 1634 in Salem, but some considered it to be an act of rebellion against England. Opinion was sought from England, and the cross was retained on crown property, such as Castle Island. [...] The crossless flags became popular in New England, and militia companies designed unique patterns on their flags. In 1665, the Royal Commissioners recommended that all ships and militia companies be ordered to fly [...] "the true colours of England, by which they may be knowne to be his majesties legittmate subjects." [...] Nevertheless, some crossless flags were still in use as late as 1680.|$|R
60|$|A very {{different}} teacher was the sea-dog Solomon Sprent, {{who lived in}} the second last cottage on the left-hand side of the main street of the village. He was one of the old tarpaulin breed, who had fought under the <b>red</b> cross <b>ensign</b> against Frenchman, Don, Dutchman, and Moor, until a round shot carried off his foot {{and put an end to}} his battles for ever. In person he was thin, and hard, and brown, as lithe and active as a cat, with a short body and very long arms, each ending in a great hand which was ever half closed as though shutting on a rope. From head to foot he was covered with the most marvellous tattooings, done in blue, red, and green, beginning with the Creation upon his neck and winding up with the Ascension upon his left ankle. Never have I seen such a walking work of art. He was wont to say that had he been owned and his body cast up upon some savage land, the natives might have learned the whole of the blessed gospel from a contemplation of his carcass. Yet with sorrow I must say that the seaman's religion appeared to have all worked into his skin, so that very little was left for inner use. It had broken out upon the surface, like the spotted fever, but his system was clear of it elsewhere. He could swear in eleven languages and three-and-twenty dialects, nor did he ever let his great powers rust for want of practice. He would swear when he was happy or when he was sad, when he was angry or when he was loving, but this swearing was so mere a trick of speech, without malice or bitterness, that even my father could hardly deal harshly with the sinner. As time passed, however, the old man grew more sober and more thoughtful, until in his latter days he went back to the simple beliefs of his childhood, and learned to fight the devil with the same steady courage with which he had faced the enemies of his country.|$|R
5|$|Following its {{official}} retirement as {{the flag of}} South Africa, the flag was adopted by some white South Africans as being a symbol of Afrikaner heritage and history. Many South Africans still {{view it as a}} symbol of apartheid, and therefore strongly discouraged its use. Despite the negative associations, it was never banned by the Government of South Africa post-1994 and the right to display it in South Africa is protected under Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa as an expression of free speech. In the 21st century, usage of the old South African flag experienced a revival of display as a symbol by white supremacists worldwide. A particular awareness of this followed the shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina black church in 2015, as the suspect Dylann Roof had previously been pictured wearing a jacket with the flag and the flag of Rhodesia on it. This association with apartheid and racism often led to calls for the flags that were used in a historical context, to be removed from display. An example of this is Cooma, Australia, where it is flown to commemorate South African workers in the Snowy Mountains Scheme alongside the Canadian <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign</b> and other flags from 1956 when the scheme was created.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign</b> {{served as}} Canada's {{national}} flag until 1965 when, after considerable debate, it {{was replaced by}} the Maple Leaf flag. The <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign</b> is still popular among traditionalists and monarchists. Although the national <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign</b> is no longer used officially, the provincial flags of Manitoba and Ontario are Red Ensigns bearing their respective coats of arms.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign</b> {{is often}} used to refer to the Canadian <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign,</b> the former de facto {{national}} flag of Canada. It was informally adopted following Canadian Confederation in 1867 and, from 1892, it was the official flag for use on Canadian merchant ships. On land, however, the official national flag was the Union Flag. Despite its unofficial status, the <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign</b> was widely used on land as well. In 1924, the <b>Red</b> <b>Ensign</b> was approved for use on Canadian government buildings outside Canada, and from 1945 for those inside Canada as well.|$|E
50|$|The first {{recognisable}} White Ensign {{appears to}} have been in use during the 16th century, consisting of a white field with a broad St George's cross, and a second St. George's cross in the canton. By 1630 the white ensign consisted of simply a white field, with a small St George's cross in the canton, which was consistent with the <b>red</b> and blue <b>ensigns</b> of the time. In 1707, the St. George's cross was reintroduced to the flag as a whole, though not as broad as before, and the Union Flag was placed in the canton. There was also a version of this flag without the overall St George's cross, which {{appears to have}} been for use in home waters only, though this flag appears to have fallen out of use by 1720. In 1801, after the Act of Union 1800, the flag was updated to include the new Union Flag in the canton, and so took on the form as used today. The blue field of the Union Flag was darkened at this time {{at the request of the}} Admiralty, in the hope that the new flags would not require replacing as often as the previous design, due to fading of the blue. Throughout this period, the proportions of the flags changed. In 1687, the then Secretary of the Admiralty, Samuel Pepys, instructed that flags be of the ratio 11:18 (18 inches long for each breadth, 11 inches at the time). In the early 18th century, the breadth of cloth had been reduced to 10 inches, so the flags became 5:9. In 1837, the breadth was reduced for the final time to 9 inches, giving the current ratio of 1:2.|$|R
5000|$|There {{appears to}} be no clear rules as to the choice between <b>red</b> and blue <b>ensigns</b> for colonial and {{dominion}} flags, however broadly speaking there seems to a correlation between colonies with a close history with the Royal Navy {{and the use of the}} blue ensign. This is consistent with the history of Vancouver Island, which, like Australia and New Zealand, only fell under British control after being surveyed during Captain James Cook's and George Vancouver's explorations of the Pacific from the 1760s to 1790s. The British Government did not formally proclaim Vancouver Island a colony until 1849, and immediately handed over administration of the nascent colony to the Hudson’s Bay Company for a period of ten years. However even in this later period, the connection with the navy remained strong. Long after the voyages of Cook and Vancouver the ships of the Royal Navy were a presence in the North East Pacific, surveying, ferrying and defending colonists, and generally asserting British control. From the early 1840s the navy began to use the harbour at Esquimalt in the extreme south of Vancouver Island, and from the 1850s this naval base became the headquarters of the entire Pacific Squadron of the Royal Navy. Historian J.F. Bosher has gone as far as to argue that Vancouver Island was only nominally Canadian even after the 1866 union of the colonies of Vancouver Island and the mainland colony of British Columbia, and the subsequent union of British Columbia with Canada, in 1871. “Colonised by sea from the British Isles half a century before it became a part of Canada in 1871, Vancouver Island is best understood as part of a worldwide system of island bases that included Aden, Bombay, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Malta, St Helena, Sydney and Trincomalee (Ceylon). Its character was formed by the Royal Navy as it moved into the Pacific and by other imperial personnel attracted by reports of cheap land in a picturesque landscape, good fishing and hunting, and a British civilisation. Surprising numbers of British officers and civil servants arrived from India and China as well as Britain. Historians from east of the Rockies, busy writing the Empire out of Canadian history, tend to approach the Island’s history through an ideological cloud of nationalism. The result has been an unfortunate distortion of Vancouver Island’s imperial past.” ...|$|R
