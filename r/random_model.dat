Existing <b>random</b> <b>models</b> for the {{constraint}} satisfaction problem (CSP) all require an extremely low constraint tightness {{in order to}} have non-trivial threshold behaviors and guaranteed hard instances at the threshold.

We show that <b>random</b> CSP <b>models</b> that enforce the constraint consistency have guaranteed exponential resolution complexity without putting much restriction on the constraint tightness. A new <b>random</b> CSP <b>model</b> is proposed to generate random CSPs with a high tightness whose instances are always consistent.

There is no theoretical maximum, but in practice, values are considerably less than one even for poor models, provided the model includes a suitable scale factor. Random experimental errors in the data contribute to [...] even for a perfect model, and these have more leverage when the data are weak or few, such as for a low-resolution data set.
