The outside of the fastener is usually a hex so a wrench can hold it. Variations include <b>reducing</b> <b>coupling</b> nuts, for joining two different size threads; sight hole coupling nuts, which have a sight hole for observing the amount of engagement; and coupling nuts with left-handed threads. These are used to make up long rod assemblies from shorter lengths of rods. The rods are threaded into the coupling nut for a certain distance. Coupling nut dimensions are described by the Industrial Fasteners Institute in standard IFI-128. It is given a plain finish. It is either cold drawn or hot rolled depending on the bar stock used. Coupling nuts threaded with two different thread sizes and profiles are called <b>reducing</b> <b>coupling</b> nuts.|$|E

5000|$|A {{coupling}} connects two pipes. If their sizes differ, {{the fitting}} {{is known as}} a <b>reducing</b> <b>coupling,</b> reducer, or an adapter. There are two types of couplings: [...] "regular" [...] and [...] "slip". A regular coupling has a small ridge or stop internally, to prevent over-insertion of a pipe, and thus under-insertion of the other pipe segment (which would result in an unreliable connection). A slip coupling (sometimes also called a repair coupling) is deliberately made without this internal stop, to allow it to be slipped into place in tight locations, such as the repair of a pipe that has a small leak due to corrosion or freeze bursting, or which had to be cut temporarily for some reason.. Since the alignment stop is missing, {{it is up to the}} installer to carefully measure the final location of the slip coupling to ensure that it is located correctly.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that arginine vasopressin (AVP) -dependent aquaporin- 2 expression is modulated by the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) in principal cells of the collecting duct, but the signaling pathways mediating this effect are unknown. Using a mouse cortical collecting duct cell line (mpkCCD(cl 4)), we found that increasing the concentration of apical extracellular calcium or treating with the CaSR agonists neomycin or Gd(3 +) attenuated AVP-dependent accumulation of aquaporin- 2 mRNA and protein; CaSR gene-silencing prevented this effect. Calcium reduced the AVP-induced accumulation of cAMP, but this did not occur by increased degradation of cAMP by phosphodiesterases or by direct inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Notably, the effect of extracellular calcium on AVP-dependent aquaporin- 2 expression was prevented by inhibition of calmodulin. In summary, our results show that high concentrations of extracellular calcium attenuate AVP-induced aquaporin- 2 expression by activating the CaSR and <b>reducing</b> <b>coupling</b> efficiency between V(2) receptor and adenylate cyclase via a calmodulin-dependent mechanism in cultured cortical collecting duct cells...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe calcium-activated small {{conductance}} {{potassium channel}} SK 3 plays {{an essential role}} in the regulation of dopamine neuron activity patterns. Here we demonstrate that expression of a human disease-related SK 3 mutation (hSK 3 Δ) in dopamine neurons of mice disrupts the balance between tonic and phasic dopamine neuron activity. Expression of hSK 3 Δ suppressed endogenous SK currents, <b>reducing</b> <b>coupling</b> between SK channels and NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and increasing permissiveness for burst firing. Consistent with enhanced excitability of dopamine neurons, hSK 3 Δ increased evoked calcium signals in dopamine neurons in vivo and potentiated evoked dopamine release. Specific expression of hSK 3 Δ led to deficits in attention and sensory gating and heightened sensitivity to a psychomimetic drug. Sensory-motor alterations and psychomimetic sensitivity were recapitulated in a mouse model of transient, reversible dopamine neuron activation. These results demonstrate the cell-autonomous effects of a human ion channel mutation on dopamine neuron physiology and the impact of activity pattern disruption on behavior...|$|E
40|$|Many of the seventy-two refactorings {{originally}} {{proposed by}} Fowler have {{the aim of}} <b>reducing</b> <b>coupling</b> in classes and thereby aiding programmer maintainability. While we might assume that classes with high levels of coupling would be the targets for refactoring more often than any other type of class, no empirical evidence exists to support this assumption. In this paper, we explore that open question through the extraction of fifty-two of Fowler's catalog of refactorings drawn from versions of four open-source systems. We compare the coupling characteristics of each set of refactored classes with the corresponding set of non-refactored classes (those for which no refactorings were applied across versions), we seek to inform one overriding research question: is there a significant difference between these two sets of classes in terms of their level of coupling? Results showed that highly-coupled classes were more prone to refactoring, particularly through a set of 'core' refactorings. However, wide variations were found across systems for our measures of coupling namely, fan-in and fan-out. Specific individual refactorings were also explored to gain an understanding of why these differences may have occurred...|$|E

We selected first for plants that grew poorly under low irradiance but performed satisfactorily at high irradiance when the transmembrane electrochemical potential of hydrogen ions is large and competent to maintain a high level of coupling factor activation without [gamma] subunit reduction.
