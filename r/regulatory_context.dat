40|$|International audienceIn open multi-agent systems, agents {{can enter}} {{and leave the}} system freely. Seeking to avoid a {{possible}} chaotic scenario, we propose to monitor these systems following an approach for the contextual regulation of laws. In our solution, agent actions can be enforced by laws from four regulatory contexts: Environment, Organization, Role and Interaction. The composition of laws from these different levels permits contextual regulations in a more flexible and complete regulation for both the modeling and implementation phases. Our approach defines a top-down contextual modeling of laws, a normative ontology to formalize the <b>regulatory</b> <b>contexts,</b> and an ontology-driven rule support for law retrieval. This approach provides a straightforward method to implement regulations according to the defined <b>regulatory</b> <b>contexts,</b> yielding law evolution, contextual composition of laws, law consistency check and agent law reasoning...|$|R

This work presents a case study where agents can dynamically adapt their behaviors according to current enforcements of contextual laws. The case study uses a flexible solution for contextual regulations, which includes a top-down contextual modeling of laws, a normative ontology to formalize the defined <b>regulatory</b> <b>contexts</b> and a rule support for law retrieval. ...|$|R

To conserve wildlife habitat after Measure 37, Oregon’s planners need to turn to these non-regulatory tools. One such tool is transferable development rights (TDRs). TDRs equitably preserve the ecosystem services of rural lands and promote efficient land use patterns. A rural property owner “transfers” her development rights to an urban developer by placing a conservation easement on her property and accepting payment from the developer, who profits from development bonuses. This payment could be declared compensation under Measure 37 and could mitigate the Measure’s potential development impacts...|$|E

We also analyze the water and sanitation <b>regulatory</b> <b>context,</b> the financing tools available and the constraint on water prices due to national regulation driven by anti-inflation policies. We look into Milan’s water sanitation service focusing on three key issues: a) how were public service mission goals implemented? b) Were the costs covered by revenues endogenous or exogenous to the water and sanitation service? And c) what is the long run cost allocation? Who did pay in fine for the infrastructure?

Common pool resources (CPRs) especially, such as water and land, can foster cooperation if affected groups manage property rights, limit free access and establish mechanisms of trust and enforcement, but also lead to conflict in fragile states [27]. The legal and <b>regulatory</b> <b>contexts</b> around property rights vary widely across jurisdictions (at the local, national, regional, and global levels) just as the adaptive capacities and resilience also varies widely [28].

40|$|Continuing {{education}} is a defining characteristic {{of work in the}} professions. Yet the approach various professional groups take to continuing professional development (CPD) differs widely in terms of regulatory frameworks and requirements, modes of delivery and funding. Importantly, little is understood about how CPD impacts on practice. This paper compares the <b>regulatory</b> <b>context</b> of different professional groups and devises a two-dimensional model to explore differences in CPD practice by mapping control over CPD content and mode. The emergent quadrants we label as liberal, regulated, managed and controlled. The paper continues by using empirical data from two studies of continuing education in dentistry and the wider literature to explore factors affecting CPD impact. The paper ends by considering how the <b>regulatory</b> <b>context</b> may affect impact and concludes that changes in the control of CPD have potential to influence the power of education to make a difference to professional practice.

This study explored {{the manner in which}} five Australian Chinese mothers engaged in reasoning talk with their preschool-aged children. A total of 83 instances of spontaneous reasoning talk were identified and analysed according to {{the manner in which the}} mothers justified their claims or statements, using Hasan’s reasoning structure framework to underpin the analysis. Both <b>regulatory</b> and nonregulatory <b>contexts</b> were analysed. The analysis revealed that in <b>regulatory</b> <b>contexts,</b> where a child’s behaviour is being controlled (for example, “eat up your dinner quickly”), mothers provided more socially based reasons to justify their directives. In nonregulatory contexts, such as shared reading, they used more logical reasoning based on universal laws of nature. The findings suggest that the reasoning talk that takes place between mothers and children provides a rich opportunity for mothers to convey their values to their children, with implications for children’s learning across a number of domains. 14 page(s...|$|R
