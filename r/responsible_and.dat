40|$|Abstract. How can {{innovation}} in nanotechnology be balanced with responsible governance? <b>Responsible</b> innovation <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> governance are broad con-cepts that mean {{different things to}} different groups. This paper presents the results of a roundtable with academics and policymakers from Europe and the U. S. held at the 2011 Society for the Study of Nanoscience and Emerging Technologies confer-ence. The results of this roundtable discussion raise heterogeneous perspectives on the definition of <b>responsible</b> innovation <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> governance <b>and</b> the role of philosophy versus practical intervention. At the same time, commonalities are also evidenced in the emphasis on the need for further progress toward commercializa-tion benefits coupled with concrete practices and public involvement...|$|R
5|$|In 1946, Peggy Carter must {{balance the}} routine office work she does for the Strategic Scientific Reserve while {{secretly}} assisting Howard Stark, who finds himself framed for supplying deadly weapons to {{enemies of the}} United States. Carter is assisted by Stark's butler, Edwin Jarvis, to find those <b>responsible</b> <b>and</b> dispose of the weapons. Carter eventually moves from New York City to Los Angeles {{to deal with the}} threats of the new atomic age in the wake of World War II, gaining new friends, a new home and potential new love.|$|E
5|$|Many critics {{repeatedly}} {{asserted that}} she was calling {{for the elimination of}} all pesticides. Yet Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging <b>responsible</b> <b>and</b> carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem. In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in Silent Spring not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.|$|E

Another such example was Tintin in Thailand, in which Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus travel to the East Asian country for a sex holiday. The book began circulating in December 1999, but in 2001, Belgian police arrested those <b>responsible</b> <b>and</b> confiscated 650 copies for copyright violation.|$|E

5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} {{more for the}} shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more <b>responsible,</b> <b>and</b> 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is <b>responsible</b> <b>and</b> involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E

5|$|During the {{beginning}} of the second Bhutto Administration, a Bhutto family feud between Benazir and her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, surfaced over the political future of Murtaza Bhutto, Nusrat's son and Benazir's younger brother. Benazir thanked Zardari for his support. In September 1996, Murtaza and seven others died in a shootout with police in Karachi, while the city was undergoing a three-year civil war. At Murtaza's funeral, Nusrat accused Benazir and Zardari of being <b>responsible</b> <b>and</b> vowed to pursue prosecution. Ghinwa Bhutto, Murtaza's widow, also accused Zardari of being behind his killing. President Farooq Leghari, who would dismiss the Bhutto government seven weeks after Murtaza's death, also suspected Benazir and Zardari's involvement. Several of Pakistan's leading newspapers alleged that Zardari wanted his brother-in-law out of the way because of Murtaza's activities as head of a breakaway faction of the PPP.|$|E

Prabhakar is determined to bring Anniyan to justice as one of Anniyan's victims, Chockalingam, an errant catering contractor with the Indian Railways, was his elder brother. In a dramatic publicity stunt, Anniyan admits to the murders he committed when he appears amidst the public and the press at the Nehru Stadium. He explains the rationale behind them and says that only when every Indian is <b>responsible</b> <b>and</b> sincere will the country prosper on a par with developed nations. His methods draw both praise and criticism. Prabhakar tries to catch Anniyan, but he escapes.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills, progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is <b>responsible,</b> <b>and</b> the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{took the}} Frisch–Peierls {{memorandum}} to Sir Henry Tizard, {{the chairman of}} the Tizard Committee, and the MAUD Committee was established to investigate further. It directed an intensive research effort, and in July 1941, produced two comprehensive reports that reached the conclusion that an atomic bomb was not only technically feasible, but could be produced before the war ended, perhaps in as little as two years. The Committee unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb as a matter of urgency, although it recognised that the resources required might be beyond those available to Britain. A new directorate known by the deliberately misleading name of Tube Alloys was created to coordinate this effort. Sir John Anderson, the Lord President of the Council, became the minister <b>responsible,</b> <b>and</b> Wallace Akers from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was appointed the director of Tube Alloys.|$|E

5|$|On 8 November {{the body}} of a British constable, Moshe Rosenfeld, was {{discovered}} near Ein Harod. Al-Qassam and his followers were believed to have been <b>responsible</b> <b>and</b> search parties set out to capture him. In this context, al-Qassam and twelve of his men decided to go underground and, leaving Haifa, took to the hills between Jenin and Nablus. There they spent ten days on the move, during which they were fed by the residents of villages in the area. The British police manhunt eventually surrounded al-Qassam in a cave near Ya'bad, in the village of Sheikh Zeid. In the long ensuing firefight, al-Qassam and three of his followers were killed, and five captured on 20 November.|$|E
5|$|Penfold {{returned}} to the FCO in 1987, where he was appointed to {{a position in the}} West Indian and Atlantic Department, which was responsible for the Caribbean and South Atlantic. The department was divided between British Dependent Territories (for which Penfold was <b>responsible)</b> <b>and</b> independent nations. In the years before and during Penfold's tenure, the British dependencies had been the subject of several diplomatic incidents and were causing problems for the British government, to whom the international community looked to resolve problems with its dependent territories. The FCO had struggled to find new governors for the territories since the winding-up of the Colonial Service—which had historically provided most governors and many civil servants—in the 1960s. Thus, Penfold recommended in a policy paper that the Diplomatic Service be considered as a recruiting pool, and that governors be recruited earlier in their career rather than at the end. He also identified several posts which could be used for training potential governors, including the one he occupied and deputy governor posts such as that in Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|The first {{persecution}} by an emperor occurred under Nero, and {{was confined}} {{to the city of}} Rome. Tacitus reports that after the Great Fire of Rome in AD64, some among the population held Nero <b>responsible</b> <b>and</b> that the emperor attempted to deflect blame onto the Christians. After Nero, a major persecution occurred under the emperor Domitian and a persecution in 177 took place at Lugdunum, the Gallo-Roman religious capital. A surviving letter from Pliny the Younger, governor of Bythinia, to the emperor Trajan describes his persecution and executions of Christians. The Decian persecution of 246–251 was a serious threat to the Church, but ultimately strengthened Christian defiance. Diocletian undertook what was to be the most severe persecution of Christians, lasting from 303 to 311.|$|E
