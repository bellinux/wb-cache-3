40|$|An {{autonomous}} subsurface {{drilling device}} has spaced-apart forward and rearward feet sections coupled to an axial thruster mechanism between them to operate using an inchworm method of mobility. In one embodiment, forward and rearward drill sections are carried on forward and rearward feet sections for drilling into {{material in the}} borehole in both forward and <b>rearward</b> <b>directions,</b> to allow the device to maneuver in any direction underground. In another embodiment, a front drill section has a drill head for cutting into the borehole and conveying cuttings through a center spine tube to an on-board depository for the cuttings. The feet sections of the device employ a foot scroll drive unit to provide radial thrust and synchronous motion to the feet for gripping the borehole wall. The axial thrust mechanism has a tandem set of thrusters in which the second thruster is used to provide the thrust needed for drilling, but not walking. A steering mechanism composed of concentric inner and outer eccentric rings provided with the rearward feet section allow small corrections in both direction and magnitude to the drilling direction as drilling commences...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} performance of pushrim-activated power-assisted wheelchairs (PAPAW) (iGLIDE, e-motion, Xtender) on national standards. DESIGN: Engineering performance and safety evaluation. SETTING: A Veteran Affairs and university-based research center. SPECIMENS: Nine PAPAWs. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Static, dynamic stability, brake effectiveness, maximum speed, acceleration, retardation, energy consumption, static, impact, and fatigue strength. RESULTS: There {{was no significant}} difference among the 3 models in forward stability. The iGLIDE was the most stable, whereas the e-motion was the least stable model in the rearward stability tests. All PAPAWs performed equally on the slopes of 3 degrees and 6 degrees in the forward and <b>rearward</b> <b>directions.</b> Braking distance was the highest for e-motion (5. 64 +/- 0. 28 m) and the lowest (1. 13 +/- 0. 03 m) for the iGLIDE in forward direction. The average equivalent cycles of all PAPAWs were 318, 292 +/- 112, 776. 6 cycles (n= 8) on the fatigue tests. All PAPAWs passed the impact and static strength tests. CONCLUSIONS: The standards of the American National Standards Institute and the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America could act as quality assurance tool for wheelchairs. The standards for wheelchairs were first approved in 1990; after 17 years, exceeding the minimum values in the standards would be a reasonable expectation...|$|R

5000|$|Certain aircraft, {{like the}} German Bf-109 and the Macchi C.202/205 were fitted with [...] "ejector-type {{exhausts}}". These exhausts converted {{some of the}} waste energy of the (internal combustion) engines exhaust-flow into {{a small amount of}} forward thrust by accelerating the hot gasses in a <b>rearward</b> <b>direction</b> to a speed greater than that of the aircraft. All exhaust setups do this to some extent, provided that the exhaust-ejection vector is opposite/dissimilar to the direction of the aircraft movement.|$|E

See the traction circle for more info. The combined vector force acting on the vehicle's center of gravity accelerates it in a more <b>rearward</b> <b>direction</b> {{as shown in the}} illustration. This causes the vehicle to travel on a Euler spiral shaped path of constant radius and speed reduction.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was constructed}} around four longerons and entirely metal covered. The water-cooled V-12, 650 hp Hispano-Suiza 12 Nb reached aft {{almost to the}} wing leading edge, and behind it {{the depth of the}} fuselage decreased only slightly to the tail. The pilot sat on the line of the trailing edge, below a deep cut-out for visibility. He had control of two Vickers machine guns mounted {{on either side of the}} top of the engine cowling. The vertical and oblique cameras were immediately behind the pilot and just in front of the observer, who had a radio station at his rear. His position was armed with twin Lewis guns, mounted so they could be rotated and moved in elevation through 360°. A third Lewis gun fired in a <b>rearward</b> <b>direction</b> through a ventral trapdoor. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and together with the elevators was elliptical in plan. The elevators carried trim tabs. In its initial configuration the fin was longer in chord than high, carrying a nearly semicircular rudder that extended down through a cut out in the elevators to the base of the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The {{new version}} {{included}} a lengthened fuselage and new, automatic leading edge slats, {{both of which}} had been tested on Me 210s and were found to dramatically improve handling. The slats had originally been featured on the earliest Me 210 models, but had been removed on production models due to poor handling. When entering a sharp turn, the slats had a tendency to open, {{due in part to the}} turn causing a drop in air pressure at the leading edge of the wings, analogous to the low pressure activation the slats were designed for in a slow landing approach (this problem was first observed on the Bf 109V14 and V15 prototypes for the Bf 109E), which added to the problems keeping the aircraft flying smoothly. However, when the problems with the general lateral instability were addressed, this was no longer a real problem. The wing panels of the earlier Me 210 had been designed with a planform geometry that placed the aerodynamic center in a <b>rearwards</b> <b>direction</b> in comparison to the earlier Bf 110, giving the outer sections of the wing planform beyond each engine nacelle a slightly greater, 12.6° leading edge sweepback angle than the inner panels' 6.0° leading edge sweep angle. This resulted in unreasonable handling characteristics in flight for the original Me 210 design. The new Me 410 outer wing panels had their planform geometry revised to bring the aerodynamic center further forwards in comparison to the Me 210, thus making the leading edge sweepback of the outer panels identical to the inner wing panels with both having identical 5.5° sweepback angles, which improved handling.|$|R
5000|$|The Ju 288's {{intricate}} main {{landing gear}} system's design proved to be troublesome, possessing twin vertical members directly behind a single oleo strut, for each pair of twinned wheels mounted to {{the lower end of}} the uniquely-attached main oleo strut unit. This single-tube oleo strut was pivoted off {{the lower end of the}} twin-member, [...] "Y-shaped" [...] retraction strut assembly, and was rotated in the vertical plane about this single attachment in a <b>rearwards</b> <b>direction</b> during retraction of the maingear unit, separate from the twin-member unit to help [...] "shorten" [...] its stowed length within the engine nacelle. This distinctive type of design required the oleo strut's freely-moving top end to physically rotate downwards and aftwards during the rear-swinging retraction of the main [...] "Y-shaped" [...] member, operated by a lever and gear-sector system mounted on the portside of each main gear assembly, operated with a long lever that had its upper end anchored to the firewall's rear surface. [...] The lever/sector gear system swiveled the oleo strut about its attachment point during the retract cycle, through an arc of roughly 180º from its position when the main gear was fully extended. The stowed position of the oleo strut ended up orienting it aftwards within the rear of the engine nacelle, and placing the wheels' axle location just ahead of and above the oleo strut's pivot point when fully retracted. Such a complex main gear design, with only the single pivoting retraction point for its oleo struts taking the primary stress of touchdown, was likely only one of the many potential sources of trouble causing the Ju 288's main gear units to repeatedly collapse on touchdown.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} MQP was {{to create}} a model of a dynamic seating system to be used to relieve {{discomfort}} that individuals often experience due to the rigid seating systems present in standard wheelchairs. Due to the rigidity of the seating system, individuals seated in wheelchairs may experience lumbar extensor spasticity, which is the involuntary extension of the lumbar muscles of the lower back. This causes discomfort and an inability to maintain an upright posture for the user of the wheelchair. A dynamic seating system can alleviate this problem by supporting the user and responding to any changes in the user’s position while seated in the wheelchair, while still maintaining the functionality of the seat. The design team modeled a system that would mimic the motion of an individual having a spasm in the lumbar muscles while seated in the wheelchair. Another objective of the design was to ensure that the seating system would force the user to return to his/her initial seating position after the completion of the spasm. The group considered the interactions between the user seated in the wheelchair and the wheelchair itself in order to model the points of contact as points of either rotational or translational motion. From there, three designs were selected for analysis of static stability on different angles of inclination in both the forward and <b>rearward</b> <b>directions.</b> By evaluating the forces due to the damper of the system at the point of attachment on the seat back and the spasm forces experienced at the shoulder blades, the design team determined the stability of the dynamic seating system in the different allowable positions. This project provided a model to determine the effect that the load on the wheelchair has on the dynamic movement of the seating system. This report also provided experimental values and analysis {{that can be used in}} future analysis and development of dynamic seating systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{aircraft}} {{met with}} an incident on March 23, 2006. On strip {{examination of the}} engine, one of the I stage compressor rotor blades was found dislodged and lying in the air intake. It was reported {{that in addition to}} this, one more blade had fractured in the airfoil section. The remaining blades of I stage were with the disc and were mechanically damaged to varying extent. The dislodged blade (No. 5) and the fractured blade (No. 24) were forwarded to the laboratory for analyzing the cause of failure. Two locking pins, one belonging to blade No. 5 and the other belonging to blade No. 24, were also sent for analysis with the following queries. (a) 	Whether or not blade No. 24 failed by fatigue? (b) 	Whether or not blade No. 5 got dislodged due to failure of blade No. 24 ? If not, what was the reason for dislodgement of blade No. 5 ? (c) 	In a normal situation, the blade sliding is expected to be in the forward direction. Why in this case, the blade No. 5 sliding was in the <b>rearward</b> <b>direction?</b> The investigation was carried out with respect to (a) and (b) and the findings were reported (refer NAL Report No. FA-MT- 995 - 05 - 2006) with the following conclusions [...] (a) 	Fractographic study confirmed that the blade No. 24 had failed by sudden overload such as impact. There were no evidences of progressive failure like fatigue. (b) 	The dislodgement of blade No. 5 without any breakage is possible only when the locking mechanism fails. (c) 	Evidences suggest that the locking pin used for the blade No. 5 is 27. 0 mm in length against the specification of 32. 0 mm. This is as good as not locking the blade. It is, therefore, believed that this particular blade had dislodged from the disc due to this assembly error leading to subsequent damages in the engine. Subsequent to the above, NAL was requested to carry out investigation on additional components, namely, (a) dovetail portion of slot No. 5 from I stage rotor disc and (b) three blades of I stage rotor where half moon cuts were noticed with a view to establish the following. (a) 	Conformation of the blade sliding in the <b>rearward</b> <b>direction.</b> (b) 	Nature of damages on the three blades supplied (whether or not due to FOD?) The necessary information, drawing, specification, photographs etc., were provided by the manufacturer for carrying out the investigation on the above components. The dovetail portion of the blade No. 5 and dovetail slot No. 5 on the rotor disc were examined to look for tell-tale marks, present if any, for conformation of the blade sliding in the <b>rearward</b> <b>direction.</b> The damages on the pin No. 5 were also examined in detail in an effort to corroborate the tell-tale marks on the dovetail slot and the blade sliding direction. The dislodged blade i. e., blade No. 5 and the other I stage rotor blades were examined to look for damages that would have occurred during blade sliding and its ejection from the rotor disc. In the event of blade sliding in the <b>rearward</b> <b>direction,</b> firstly, the blade is expected to have severe damages due to obstruction caused by the stator blades. In such a case, the blade would get fractured into pieces by the impact forces acted upon the blade by the stator blades. Secondly, once the blade moves out of the dovetail slot in the <b>rearward</b> <b>direction,</b> it cannot come out into the air intake without damaging most of the I stage rotor blades. None of these were found to have occurred in the present case and hence, the evidences do not support the theory of blade sliding in the <b>rearward</b> <b>direction.</b> The signatures left on the blade retaining pin and the dovetail slot No. 5 of the rotor disc were analyzed. These signatures also did not conform to the findings of the DI committee wherein it was established that the blade sliding was in the <b>rearward</b> <b>direction.</b> On the contrary, there were adequate evidences to suggest that the blade No. 5 sliding was in the forward direction. A detailed account of the findings is submitted in this report. ...|$|E

Data obtained show that, {{in the absence of}} storm-relative mean winds in the stratosphere, the primary mode of excitation of gravity waves is by mechanical forcing owing to oscillatory updrafts. The stratospheric response consists of waves whose periods match the primary periods of the forcing. Due to the tendency of the oscillating updrafts to propagate toward the rear of the storm, gravity wave propagation is limited primarily to the <b>rearward</b> <b>direction.</b> Results suggest that squall-line-generated gravity waves arise from mechanical forcing rather than thermal effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} and calibration of a focused, continuous wave, coherent detection CO 2 lidar operated for {{the measurement of}} atmospheric backscatter coefficient, B(m), was examined. This instrument functions by transmitting infrared (10 micron) light into the atmosphere and collecting the light which is scattered in the <b>rearward</b> <b>direction.</b> Two distinct modes of operation were considered. In volume mode, the scattered light energy from many aerosols is detected simultaneously, whereas in the single particle mode (SPM), the scattered light energy from a single aerosol is detected. The analysis considered possible sources of error {{for each of these}} two cases, and also considered the conditions where each technique would have superior performance. The analysis showed that, within reasonable assumptions, the value of B(m) could be accurately measured by either the VM or the SPM method. The understanding of the theory developed during the analysis was also applied to a pulsed CO 2 lidar.

40|$|A {{modified}} triangular wing of {{aspect ratio}} 2. 53 having an airfoil section 3. 7 percent thick {{at the root}} and 5. 98 percent thick at the tip was designed {{in an attempt to}} improve the lift and drag characteristics of triangular wings. Free-flight drag and stability tests were made using rocket-propelled models equipped with the modified wing. The Mach number range of the test was from 0. 70 to 1. 37. Test results indicated the following: The lift-curve slope of wing plus fuselage approaches the theoretical value of wing alone at supersonic Mach numbers. The drag coefficient, based on total wing area, for wing plus interference was approximately 0. 0035 at subsonic Mach numbers and 0. 0080 at supersonic Mach numbers. The maximum shift in aerodynamic center for the complete configuration was 14 percent in the <b>rearward</b> <b>direction</b> from the forward position of 51. 5 percent of mean aerodynamic chord at subsonic Mach numbers. The variation of lift and moment with angle of attack was linear at supersonic Mach numbers for the range of coefficients covered in the test. The high value of lift-curve slope was considered to be a significant result attributable to the wing modifications...|$|E
