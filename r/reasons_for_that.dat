5|$|On {{a council}} held in Constantinople on the {{relations}} with Bulgaria {{it was decided}} that the two countries should begin negotiations despite the calls for punishing the Bulgarians for the invasion. Michael Shishman divorced his wife Anna Neda and married Theodora Palaiologina, the 35-year-old widow of emperor Theodore Svetoslav. The exact <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> act are unclear. Many historians suggest that the deterioration of the Bulgarian-Serbian relations was rooted in the Serbian penetration in Macedonia. The marriage cemented the peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire but the need for an ally against the Serbs made Michael Shishman prone to make concessions. It was decided that the border should follow the Philippopolis-Chernomen-Sozopol line. The agreement was finally signed in the autumn of 1324 and Michael Shishman spent the next several years at peace with his neighbors.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} Armin's joining the Chamberlain's Men is as mysterious as its occasion. That it was {{connected}} to Kempe's departure has been generally accepted; however, the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> departure are not clear. One traditional view—that the company in general or Shakespeare specifically had begun to tire of Kempe's old-fashioned clowning—is still current, though the main evidence for this view consists of Kempe's departure {{and the type of}} comic roles Shakespeare wrote after 1600. Armin played on the Globe stage by August 1600; Wiles theorizes that he may have joined the Chamberlain's Men in 1599, but continued to perform solo pieces at the Curtain; however, he may also have played with the company at the Curtain, while Kempe was still a member.|$|E

She was aware that an ambulance was called that evening, but learned about the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> only later, during the police investigation. The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue, including that barriers should be placed [...] from the stage. Promoter Tomáš Fiala testified that although this was not the case, the band had not expressed any concerns to him either before or after the concert.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to historical patterns, the Court {{has gone from}} having a [...] "Catholic seat" [...] to being what some have characterized as a [...] "Catholic court." [...] The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> are subject to debate, and are a matter of intense public scrutiny. That {{the majority of the}} Court is now Catholic, and that the appointment of Catholics has become accepted, represents a historical 'sea change.' [...] It has fostered accusations that the court has become [...] "a Catholic boys club" [...] (particularly as the Catholics chosen tend to be politically conservative) and calls for non-Catholics to be nominated.|$|E
500|$|Pathways {{sold more}} copies than expected, making it Bungie's first {{commercial}} success. It {{was the third}} bestselling Macintosh title {{of the first half}} of 1994 after Myst and Sim City 2000, with projected seven-figure sales for the year. The game made Bungie enough money that the company was able to move from Seropian's apartment to a dedicated office in Chicago's South Side. At their new location, the Bungie team expanded and began work on another first-person shooter, Marathon. Interviewed by Inside Mac Games, Jones said that he did not believe that there would ever be a sequel to Pathways. [...] "There's a lot of <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> one of them being that I tend to dislike sequels," [...] he said, [...] "A lot of cool things have happened with the rendering technology since Pathways shipped, and it suggests some different products which don't really fit into the Pathways world." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{commercial}} and critical failure of the film, Carpenter became very disillusioned with Hollywood and became an independent filmmaker. He said in an interview, [...] "The experience [...] was the reason I stopped making movies for the Hollywood studios. I won't work for them again. I think Big Trouble is a wonderful film, and I'm very proud of it. But the reception it received, and the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> reception, were {{too much for me}} to deal with.

2500|$|There is {{an element}} of countenance in many Krishna {{centered}} traditions to the subordination of Krishna to Vishnu. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> are given that it was the easiest way to accommodate Krishna's human story within the composite Vaishnava theological perspective. These [...] "core texts assert and defend the ultimacy of Krsna's identity". However inclusion of Krishna in the list of avataras does not necessarily subordinate him to Vishnu as one of the latter's expansions. Early authors, such as 12th century Jayadeva considered dasavatara to be principal incarnations of Krishna, rather than Vishnu.|$|E
2500|$|So far the Prosecutor's {{office of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina has only filed indictments {{for the crime}} of {{genocide}} relating to the Srebrenica massacre, stating that [...] "investigations have not shown elements of genocide for any other areas [...] ".

2500|$|Because of Chamberlain's anti-Catholicism, Catholic {{newspapers}} all published very hostile {{reviews of}} The Foundations, though Catholic reviewers rarely faulted Die Grundlagen [...] for its anti-Semitism. Protestant völkisch newspapers [...] gave The Foundations very good reviews while more orthodox Protestant newspapers were disturbed by Chamberlain's {{call for a}} racialized Christianity. One Protestant reviewer, Professor Baentsch of Jena wrote that Chamberlain had systematically distorted the Book of Job, the Psalms, the Prophets, and other books of the Old Testament, leading him to conclude {{that it was no}} surprise that Chamberlain found so little common ground between Christianity and Judaism given the way he had misrepresented the entire Old Testament. One German Jewish reviewer, the Berlin banker Heinrich Meyer-Cohn wrote that The Foundations was [...] "bad, unclear, and illogical in its train of thought and unpleasing in style, full of false modesty and genuine superciliousness, full of real ignorance and false affectation of learning." [...] German Jewish groups like the Centralverein deutscher Staatsburge jüdischen Glaubens and the Verein zur Abwehr Antisemitismus repeatedly issued statements in the early 20th century that the popularity of The Foundations was a major source of concern for them, noting that Die Grundlagen [...] had caused a major increase in anti-Semitism with many German Jews now finding themselves the objects of harassment and sometimes violence. The German Jewish journalist Moritz Goldstein wrote in 1912 that he had become a Zionist because he believed there was no future for Jews in Germany, and one of the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> belief was: [...] "Chamberlain believes what he says and for that very reason his distortions shock me. And thousands more believe as he does for the book goes one edition after another and I would still like to know if many Germanic types, whose self-image is pleasantly indulged by this theory, are able to remain critical enough to question its countless injustices and errors?". Goldstein added that the case of Chamberlain showed his views as typical of those of [...] "the best spirits, clever, truth-loving men who, however, as soon they speak of Jews, fall into a blind, almost rabid hatred".|$|E
