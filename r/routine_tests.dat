2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the NTSB and Parker Hannifin had already ruled out the {{possibility}} of mechanical failure as a cause to the crash of Flight 185 due to a defective PCU servo valve-unit (manufactured by Parker Hannifin), an independent and private investigation refocused on and further examined the recovered PCU device whose malfunctioning has been pointed out in other sudden Boeing 737 crashes. The manufacturer's records relating to this particular unit revealed that it had failed some <b>routine</b> <b>tests,</b> but they claimed to have corrected these problems. A metals expert, with the use of images from a scanning electron microscope, concluded that the servo valve had 'chip-outs' and numerous burrs [...] "that could easily have interfered with the smooth operation of the valve." [...] After this investigation was complete, in 2004, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury in the United States, which was not allowed to hear or consider the NTSB's conclusions about the accident, found that the crash was caused by a defective servo valve in the plane's rudder. The hydraulic PCU device manufacturer, Parker Hannifin, was ordered to pay the three families of victims involved in that case US$43.6 million. After threatening to appeal the verdict, Parker Hannifin later compensated all families involved (although it did not accept liability).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a preventable disease {{that can have}} improved outcomes with early diagnosis and treatment. The CDC recommends that HIV testing be incorporated into clinical settings as part of routine medical care. Methods: Individual, open-ended {{interviews were conducted with}} primary care providers and administrators to obtain their views regarding the meaning of <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> and the barriers and facilitators to implementing <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> in their respective practices. Results: Most respondents supported <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing,</b> although their definitions of routine varied. Barriers for providers included time and financial constraints to appropriately conduct HIV counseling and testing and inadequate HIV education and training. Facilitators for implementing <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> included patients’ feelings of empowerment and reduced HIV stigma. Conclusions: The implementation of <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> in primary care practices appears to be an acceptable public health intervention. Next steps should include efforts to standardize the definition of <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> and working with primary care settings to better understand and reduce barriers to <b>routine</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> is an {{essential}} approach to identifying undiagnosed infections, linking people to care and treatment, and preventing new infections. In Washington, DC, where HIV prevalence is 2. 4 %, a combination of <b>routine</b> and targeted <b>testing</b> approaches has been implemented since 2006. We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the District of Columbia (DC) Department of Health's routine and targeted HIV testing implementation strategies. We collected HIV testing data from 3 types of DC Department of Health-funded testing sites (clinics, hospitals, and community-based organizations); collected testing and labor costs; and calculated effectiveness measures including cost per new diagnosis and cost per averted transmission. Compared to <b>routine</b> <b>testing,</b> targeted testing resulted in higher positivity rates (1. 33 % vs. 0. 44 %). <b>Routine</b> <b>testing</b> averted 34. 30 transmissions per year compared to targeted testing at 17. 78. The cost per new diagnosis was lower for targeted testing ($ 2, 467 vs. $ 7, 753 per new diagnosis) as was the cost per transmission averted ($ 33, 160 vs. $ 104, 205). When stratified by testing site, both testing approaches were most cost effective in averting new transmissions when conducted by community based organizations ($ 25, 037 routine; $ 33, 123 targeted) compared to hospitals or clinics. While <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> identified more newly diagnosed infections and averted more infections than targeted testing, targeted testing is more cost effective per diagnosis and per transmission averted overall. Given the high HIV prevalence in DC, the DC Department of Health's implementation strategy should continue to encourage <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> implementation with emphasis on a combined testing strategy among community-based organizations...|$|R

Methods Community counsellors were trained in <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> policy using a specific training module from June 2005 through November 2005. Key outcomes during the first 6 months of <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> were compared with the prior 6 -month “opt-in ” period, and clients were interviewed. Findings Of the 4551 women presenting for antenatal care during the first 6 months of <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing,</b> 4547 (99. 9 %) were tested for HIV compared with 3058 (65 %) of 4700 women during the last 6 months of the opt-in testing (P < 0. 001), with a corresponding increase in the numbers of HIV-infected women identified antenatally (926 compared with 513, P < 0. 001). During <b>routine</b> <b>testing,</b> more HIV-infected women collected results compared to the opt-in testing (908 compared with 487, P < 0. 001) resulting in a significant increase in deliveries by HIV-infected women (256 compared with 186, P = 0. 001); more mother/infant pairs received antiretroviral prophylaxis (n = 256) compared to the opt-in testing (n = 185); and more mother/infant pairs followed up at clinics (105 compared with 49, P = 0. 002).

40|$|The Botswana {{government}} recently {{implemented a}} policy of routine or "opt-out" HIV testing {{in response to the}} high prevalence of HIV infection, estimated at 37 % of adults. We conducted a cross-sectional, population-based study of 1, 268 adults from five districts in Botswana to assess knowledge of and attitudes toward <b>routine</b> <b>testing,</b> correlates of HIV testing, and barriers and facilitators to testing, 11 months after the introduction of this policy. Most participants (81 %) reported being extremely or very much in favor of <b>routine</b> <b>testing.</b> The majority believed that this policy would decrease barriers to testing (89 %), HIV-related stigma (60 %), and violence toward women (55 %), and would increase access to antiretroviral treatment (93 %). At the same time, 43 % of participants believed that <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> would lead people to avoid going to the doctor for fear of testing, and 14 % believed that this policy could increase gender-based violence related to testing. The prevalence of self-reported HIV testing was 48 %. Adjusted correlates of testing included female gender (AOR = 1. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 1 - 1. 9), higher education (AOR = 2. 0, 95 % CI = 1. 5 - 2. 7), more frequent healthcare visits (AOR = 1. 9, 95 % CI = 1. 3 - 2. 7), perceived access to HIV testing (AOR = 1. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 1 - 2. 5), and inconsistent condom use (AOR = 1. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 2 - 2. 1). Individuals with stigmatizing attitudes toward people living with HIV and AIDS were less likely to have been tested for HIV/AIDS (AOR = 0. 7, 95 % CI = 0. 5 - 0. 9) or to have heard of <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> (AOR = 0. 59, 95 % CI = 0. 45 - 0. 76). While experiences with voluntary and <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> overall were positive, 68 % felt that they could not refuse the HIV test. Key barriers to testing included fear of learning one's status (49 %), lack of perceived HIV risk (43 %), and fear of having to change sexual practices with a positive HIV <b>test</b> (33 %). <b>Routine</b> <b>testing</b> appears to be widely supported and may reduce barriers to testing in Botswana.
