500|$|Fields edited Steven Spielberg's {{first major}} film, The Sugarland Express (1974). She became widely celebrated {{for her work}} as the film editor on Spielberg's next film, Jaws (1975), for which she won both the Academy Award for Film Editing and the American Cinema Editors Eddie Award in 1976. Leonard Maltin has {{characterized}} her editing as [...] "sensational". Gerald Peary, who interviewed Fields in 1980, wrote that, [...] "Jaws scared the world, brought in a fortune for Universal, and made Verna Fields, who won an Academy Award, about as famous 'overnight' as an editor ever gets." [...] He then quoted Fields as saying that, [...] "Steven {{told me it was}} because I had cut the first picture that was a monumental success in which you can <b>really</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> editing. And people discovered that it was a woman who edited Jaws." ...|$|E
500|$|Sell said God of War {{has very}} few flaws {{and that the}} only one worth {{mentioning}} is the camera system: he said that although the cameras do a great job of following Kratos, [...] "there are a fair few annoying moments when you're attacked by something off-screen, or you fail to make a jump because you couldn't <b>really</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> jump properly". Other minor complaints from Sell include its lack of replayability, the amount of time it takes to upgrade items, and the final fight with Ares, which he said is [...] "a little disappointing". Reed wrote that in a few notable occasions, he found some of the platforming balancing acts [...] "a little bothersome". He said players may be overwhelmed by the number of enemies, but they will eventually get their [...] "brain and reactions in gear and move onto the next gripping section and feel hugely satisfied".|$|E
500|$|Dek Hogan of Digital Spy reacted {{negatively}} to Adam's introduction in [...] "Dalek" [...] stating he [...] "didn’t <b>really</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> point of Todd Grimshaw out of Corrie popping up." [...] He suggested {{it would have}} been more entertaining had the episode featured Langley's screen mother from Coronation Street instead. Ian Hyland of the Sunday Mirror also disliked Adam's introduction, describing [...] "the introduction of a puppy-love sequence between Rose and a cute English boy" [...] as [...] "very, very irritating". SFX Magazine commented on the similarity between Adam's introduction to the future and that of Rose in [...] "The End of the World" [...] stating [...] "it was clearly a deliberate parallel on Russell's part, as part of his scheme to contrast and compare the reactions of Rose and Adam". Their website reviewer observed that Adam's [...] "comedy faint" [...] marked him out as an unsuitable traveller. Marc Edward DiPaulo of the University of Oklahoma notes that Adam's role in [...] "The Long Game" [...] is to provide satire on the media and to function as [...] "a condemnation of those who cannot stop immersing themselves in television, the Internet, iPods, and other nonstop broadcasters of what the Doctor calls [...] "useless information."" [...] Fraser McAlpine, reviewing Adam's appearances as companion for BBC America's Anglophenia blog describes him as a [...] "craven meddler" [...] and a [...] "social climber". By virtue of his failures, Adam becomes [...] "the companion that proves the worth of all of the other companions".|$|E

500|$|James Berardinelli of ReelViews called Bridge to Terabithia [...] "easily {{the best}} family {{feature of the}} early year". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post praised the script for being [...] "utterly {{recognizable}} and authentic", and thought Robb and Hutcherson were [...] "perfectly cast". Hornaday wrote that although the final five minutes succumbed to [...] "oversweet sentiment", viewers would remember the film's [...] "warmth and respect with which it pays homage to first love". Jessica Grose of The Village Voice commended director Csupó for omitting [...] "cutesy tween stereotypes", and felt Jess's relationship with his father elevated Bridge to Terabithia from [...] "a good kids movie to a classic contender". The New York Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis believed that the fantasy was kept in the background [...] "to find magic in the everyday", and thought Csupó directed [...] "like someone intimate with the pain of being different, allowing each personality {{more than a single}} characteristic". The reviewer praised all the leads for their strong performances, especially Deschanel and Madison. Catsoulis found the film was able to handle adult topics [...] "with nuance and sensitivity", and being consistently smart and [...] "delicate as a spider web", {{it was the kind of}} children's movie [...] "rarely seen nowadays". Miriam di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Hutcherson and Robb's performances, saying that [...] "the film's heart and soul rests on the abilities of its young lead characters to make us <b>really</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> world through children's eyes. The dynamic duo of Hutcherson and Robb do not disappoint." ...|$|E
500|$|Joystiq's Alexander Sliwinski {{wrote about}} Mileena {{that instead of}} [...] "focusing on her {{fighting}} style, or assets," [...] they simply could not [...] "get past one thing: how does she pronounce the letter P without touching her lips together?" [...] In 2010, Game Informer included her among the palette swap characters not wanted by {{them in the future}} Mortal Kombat games, later describing her in the 2011 game as being [...] "as creepy as ever." [...] When American radio host Howard Stern mocked a Mortal Kombat fan who admitted that he masturbates to Mileena, Matt Helgeson of Game Informer called the latter [...] "insane" [...] as [...] "onanism and Mileena should not mix." [...] Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe wrote that [...] "as for the date theme , frankly we can’t <b>really</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> appeal – she’s not a patch on Sheeva, after all." [...] GameDaily praised the [...] "superb fashion sense" [...] of Soulcaliburs Taki by contrasting her with Mileena. Writing about [...] "outdated and cringe-worthy representations of women in video games" [...] in 2012, MMGN's Nathan Misa stated: [...] "Look, I like Lara Croft's booty shorts or Mileena's two...deadly sais as much as every other guy, but why not have more than virtual polygons to ogle at?" [...] Discussing what she perceived as video games' popular misconceptions about women, Sarah Ditum wrote in PlayStation Official Magazine that same year: [...] "Relax—we don’t really bite. Well, not unless we have a face full of hell fangs at the top of an impossibly hot bod. Hellooo, Mileena." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 Blackman {{released}} Music for the New Millennium on her Sacred Sounds Label. [...] "It's {{rooted in}} tradition, but it's not traditional music. It's explorative, very creative, very expressive, {{and we really}} try to expand any ideas we have that everything is played over the forms, but we like to stretch it, and <b>really</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> colors and make the music grow and move", says Blackman. [...] "We experiment – but it's never free. Everything is written out. I have charts for all the songs. We expand on what's there, and stretch harmonics and note choices".|$|E
500|$|Hale said [...] "there is {{an entire}} {{generation}} that has come of age having never <b>really</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> dark sky", so {{part of what he}} wanted to accomplish with Earthrise was [...] "to create an environment where students could spend some nights out under a dark sky and <b>see</b> what it <b>really</b> looks like." ...|$|R

5000|$|When Griff Rhys Jones {{was invited}} to make the series, he was a {{mountaineering}} novice:"Ten years ago I trudged up volcano Stromboli in a hard hat; and seem to recall once taking a long walk in the Borders (it was hilly).

2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Rosenqvist said the result had been awaiting Mahindra {{for a long period}} of time and felt as if his team could win many races over the course of the season and the first Berlin race was an event that saw [...] "all the puzzle pieces came together." [...] He added that despite small errors, he was still able to secure the victory: [...] "We work so hard and you can <b>really</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> suffering sometimes but when you have days like this it's all worth it." [...] Di Grassi stated that his car was not satisfactory and that his team started the day [...] "very lost" [...] and made car set-up alterations: [...] "If you look at the pure pace from the morning - this was not the best race for us, so I tried to hang on as much as I could." [...] He revealed he lost regeneration from his overheating battery at the end of his first stint which persisted in his second stint. However di Grassi affirmed his team would improve his car and challenge for the victory in the following day's race. Third-place finisher Heidfeld said Mahindra's achievement of strong finish was [...] "a really outstanding result" [...] and stated he struggled in the first car but could mount a challenge to di Grassi in his second vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you <b>really</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't know until we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E

60|$|Some {{are of the}} Opinion {{that the}} Communication with the Devil, or between the Devil and those Creatures his Agents, has {{something}} assimulating in it, and {{that if they were}} tolerable before, they are, ipso facto, turn'd into DEVILS by talking with him; I will not say but that a Tremor in the Limbs, a Horror in the Aspect, and a surprizing Stare in the Eyes may seize upon some of them when they <b>really</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> DEVIL, and that the frequent Repetition may make those Distortions, which we so constantly see in their Faces becomes natural to them; by which if it does not continue always upon the Countenance, they can at least, like the Posture-Masters, cast themselves into such Figures and frightful Dislocations of the Lines and Features in their Faces, and so assume a Devil's Face suitable to the Occasion, or as may serve the turn for which they take it up, and as often as they have any use for it.|$|E
60|$|Having added {{these two}} {{remarkable}} instances {{to the general}} train of similar facts quoted by Ferriar, Hibbert, and other writers who have more recently considered the subject, there can, we think, be little doubt of the proposition, that the external organs may, from various causes, become so much deranged as to make false representations to the mind; and that, in such cases, men, in the literal sense, <b>really</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> empty and false forms and hear the ideal sounds which, in a more primitive state of society, are naturally enough referred to the action of demons or disembodied spirits. In such unhappy cases the patient is intellectually in the condition of a general whose spies have been bribed by the enemy, and who must engage himself in the difficult and delicate task of examining and correcting, by his own powers of argument, the probability of the reports which are too inconsistent to be trusted to.|$|E

It {{is enough to make}} a graven image laugh, to see {{apparently}} rational people, away down here in this wholesome and merciless slaughter-day for shams, still mouthing empty reverence for those moss-backed frauds and scoundrelisms, hereditary kingship and so-called [...] "nobility." [...] It is enough to make the monarchs and nobles themselves laugh--and in private they do; there can be no question about that. I think there is only one funnier thing, and that is the spectacle of these bastard Americans--these Hamersleys and Huntingtons and such--offering cash, encumbered by themselves, for rotten carcases and stolen titles. When our great brethren the disenslaved Brazilians frame their Declaration of Independence, I hope they will insert this missing link: [...] "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all monarchs are usurpers, and descendants of usurpers; for the reason that no throne was ever set up in this world by the will, freely exercised, of the only body possessing the legitimate right to set it up--the numerical mass of the nation." ...|$|E
