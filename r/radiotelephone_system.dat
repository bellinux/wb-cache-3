50|$|Germany's first mobile-communications {{services}} were <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>systems</b> that were {{owned and operated}} by the state postal monopoly, Deutsche Bundespost. It launched the analog first-generation C-Netz ("C Network", marketed as C-Tel), Germany's first true mobile phone network in 1985.|$|R
5000|$|Germany's initial mobile {{communications}} services were <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>systems</b> that were {{owned and operated}} by the state postal monopoly, Deutsche Bundespost. These early mobile communications networks were referred to as the [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] networks.|$|R
50|$|During 1942-1945 Young {{worked on}} radar and {{communication}} {{systems for the}} US Armed Services. In 1945 Young began work on mobile <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>systems</b> in vehicles for coverage of urban areas and along highways. He developed systems for reducing interference between mobile systems that are closely spaced in frequency and location. Young {{served as chairman of}} a Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA) subcommittee TR8.9 on systems standards for mobile communications equipment.|$|R

50|$|As of 2001, {{there were}} 300,000 main-line {{telephones}} and, in 2005, there were 610,000 mobile phones. The telephone system has its centre in Saint-Denis, and the domestic telephone system uses a modern open wire and microwave relay network. The international system employs a <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>system,</b> with connections to Comoros, France and Madagascar. A new microwave relay station to Mauritius {{is also in}} use, along with one Intelsat satellite-earth station.|$|E
5000|$|The S-Phone {{system was}} a UHF duplex <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>system</b> {{developed}} during World War II {{for use by}} Special Operations Executive agents working behind enemy lines to communicate with friendly aircraft and coordinate landings and the dropping of agents and supplies. The system was composed of a [...] "Ground" [...] transceiver, designed by Captain Bert Lane, and an [...] "Air" [...] transceiver designed by Major Hobday, both of the Royal Signals.|$|E
5000|$|A {{radiotelephone}} (or radiophone) is {{a communications}} system for transmission of speech over radio. <b>Radiotelephone</b> <b>systems</b> {{are not necessarily}} interconnected with the public [...] "land line" [...] telephone network. [...] "Radiotelephony" [...] means transmission of sound (audio) by radio, in contrast to radiotelegraphy (transmission of telegraph signals) or video transmission. Where a two-way radio system is arranged for speaking and listening at a mobile station, and {{where it can be}} interconnected to the public switched telephone system, the system can provide mobile telephone service.|$|R
5000|$|Collins {{participated in}} demonstrations {{promoting}} stock sales, which over time included extravagant and misleading claims. A common company tactic was {{to set up}} a demonstration at a hotel in a targeted town, and, after successfully talking between two rooms using the short-range induction system, claim that a community-wide radiotelephone exchange had also been perfected, and would be installed pending financing by local stock sales. These tests were widely publicized, featuring promotional photographs of prominent persons, including William Jennings Bryan and US President William Howard Taft, using the company's devices. The company also claimed that soon [...] "every auto will be provided with a portable wireless telephone". However, the <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>systems</b> were never actually constructed.|$|R
50|$|Mobile radio {{telephone}} systems were telephone systems of wireless type {{that preceded the}} modern cellular mobile form of telephony technology. Since they were the predecessors {{of the first generation}} of cellular telephones, these systems are sometimes retroactively referred to as pre-cellular (or sometimes zero generation, that is, 0G) systems. Technologies used in pre-cellular systems included the Push to Talk (PTT or manual), Mobile Telephone System (MTS), Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS), and Advanced Mobile Telephone System (AMTS) systems.These early mobile telephone systems can be distinguished from earlier closed <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>systems</b> in that they were available as a commercial service {{that was part of the}} public switched telephone network, with their own telephone numbers, rather than part of a closed network such as a police radio or taxi dispatch system.|$|R
50|$|A {{standard}} landline telephone allows both {{users to}} talk and listen simultaneously; effectively there are two open channels between the two end-to-end users of the system. In a <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>system,</b> this form of working, known as full-duplex, require a radio system to simultaneously transmit and receive on two separate channels, which both wastes bandwidth and presents some technical challenges. It is, however, the most comfortable method of voice communication for users, and it is currently used in cell phones and {{was used in the}} former IMTS.|$|E
50|$|Cab Secure Radio (CSR) is an in-cab {{analogue}} <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>system</b> used on {{parts of}} the British railway network. Its main function {{is to provide a}} secure speech link between the train driver and the signaller which cannot be overheard by other train drivers. In areas where CSR is used it must be the primary method of communication between driver and signaller, always being used in preference to the signal post telephone. Within the next few years CSR will be replaced by the GSM-R digital system, as it forms the initial phase of rollout of ERTMS throughout the UK.|$|E
50|$|In the interim, Tenzing {{deployed}} a very-low-bandwidth {{system in}} partnership with Verizon AirFone's <b>radiotelephone</b> network. This <b>system</b> was in commercial operation on United Airlines {{and a few other}} U.S. carriers {{for more than a year}} before being discontinued.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the echo}} {{canceling}} for hand-free set mobile <b>radiotelephone</b> or teleconference <b>system,</b> the double-talk is occurred when both the near-end and the far-end speakers talk simultaneously. The conventional adaptive digital FIR filter using algorithm such as LMS fails {{to track the}} echo path in this condition. Because the error signal is contaminated to the near-end signal to estimate the gradient correctly. The Correlation LMS (CLMS) and Extended Correlation LMS (ECLMS) algorithms have been introduced by authors to challenge the double-talk in the echo canceling system. In this {{paper we propose a}} new implementation of ECLMS algorithm in the wavelet domain called wavelet transform extended correlation LMS algorithm (WECLMS) to improve the speed of the convergence. The computer simulation results support the theoretical findings and verify the robustness of the proposed WECLMS algorithm in the double-talk situation...|$|R

The conventional adaptive digital FIR filter using algorithm such as LMS fails {{to track the}} echo path in this condition. Because the error signal is contaminated to the near-end signal to estimate the gradient correctly. The Extended Correlation LMS (ECLMS) algorithm has been introduced by authors to challenge the double-talk in the echo canceling system. Here, the gradient search algorithm is obtained from the correlation function and the error lags between autocorrelation and cross-correlation values of the near and the far end signals. To reduce the computational load of the ECLMS algorithm, the frequency domain version of the algorithm has also previously been defined by the authors but the performance was not appropriate. In this paper, to implement the exact linear convolution in the frequency domain a new fast implementation of the ECLMS algorithm by using zero padding and Half Overlapped Save (HOS) method has been proposed. Also the correlation values are calculated directly in the frequency domain. The computer simulation results support the theoretical findings and verify the robustness of the proposed FBECLMS algorithm in the double-talk situation...|$|R
