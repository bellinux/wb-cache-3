Moreover, the polymerized DNAs appear to be covalently attached to the AbiK protein, presumably because an amino acid serves as a primer. Mutagenesis experiments indicate that the polymerase activity resides in the RT motifs and is essential for phage resistance in vivo.

While all retroviruses replicate in dividing cells, lentiviruses uniquely replicate in nondividing cells such as macrophages.

Indeed, a recently discovered anti-HIV/SIV restriction factor, SAMHD 1, {{which is a}} dNTP triphosphohydrolase, {{is responsible for the}} limited dNTP pool of nondividing cells. Lentiviral <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> (<b>RT)</b> uniquely stay functional even at the low dNTP concentrations in nondividing cells. Interestingly, Vpx of HIV- 2 /SIVsm proteosomally degrades SAMHD 1, which elevates cellular dNTP pools and accelerates lentiviral replication in nondividing cells. These Vpx-encoding lentiviruses rapidly replicate in nondividing cells by encoding both highly functional RTs and Vpx.
