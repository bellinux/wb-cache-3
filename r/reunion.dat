5|$|Many other {{endemic species}} of Mauritius and <b>Réunion</b> were lost after {{the arrival of}} humans, so that the {{ecosystems}} of these islands are severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, the islands were entirely covered in forests, very little of which remains today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. On Mauritius, the Mascarene grey parakeet lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. On <b>Réunion,</b> it lived alongside the <b>Réunion</b> ibis, the hoopoe starling, the Mascarene parrot, the <b>Réunion</b> parakeet, the <b>Réunion</b> swamphen, the <b>Réunion</b> owl, the <b>Réunion</b> night heron, and the <b>Réunion</b> pink pigeon.|$|E

5|$|As Hondo {{began to}} regenerate, Mauritius and <b>Réunion</b> were placed under {{a state of}} alert. Residents in <b>Réunion</b> were advised to stay up to date with the latest {{warnings}} on the storm, not go hiking in the mountains, ensure their disaster kit is fully stocked, {{stay away from the}} shore, and know the locations of the nearest shelters. Initially, residents in Madagascar feared that Hondo would make landfall in the country after being struck by Cyclone Ivan on February16. However, the storm turn towards the southwest, away from Madagascar. On February23 ex-Hondo tracked just offshore Mauritius before passing directly over <b>Réunion,</b> just short of moderate tropical storm status. Sustained winds of 50km/h (31mph) with gusts up to 76km/h (47mph) were recorded on Mauritius while sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph) with gusts up to 99km/h (61mph) were recorded on <b>Réunion.</b> The highest rainfall total was recorded at Takamaka, totaling to 750mm (29.5in).

5|$|Contrary to Feuilley's claims, Dubois {{mentioned}} that the Mascarene parrot was not edible which {{may have led to}} <b>Réunion</b> visitors mostly ignoring it.

5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on January19 off {{the east}} coast of Madagascar, which became Tropical Disturbance 6 two days later. It drifted to the east, strengthening to tropical depression status on January22, and passing 330km (205mi) west of <b>Réunion.</b> Increased wind shear caused the system to weaken as it turned back to the west, dissipating over Madagascar on January24. On <b>Réunion,</b> the system dropped about 100mm (4in) of rainfall, including a total of 50mm (2in) falling in a 90minute period in Cape Bernard.|$|E

5|$|As Southampton stopped firing, the {{remaining}} masts of the Haitian ship fell overboard. Casualties on Heureuse <b>Réunion</b> were immense: of the 600–700 crew, 105 were dead and 120 wounded, the latter including Gaspard, who subsequently died of his injuries. Yeo's loss was one man killed and ten wounded, from {{a crew of}} 212. Seeking to rid himself of so many prisoners, Yeo landed most of them at Maraguana before sailing to Port au Prince, where the rest were landed and temporary jury masts were fitted to Heureuse <b>Réunion</b> for the journey to Jamaica. The British retained 20 prisoners for trial at Port Royal. Heureuse <b>Réunion</b> was repaired at Jamaica and subsequently restored to Christophe under the name Améthyste, returning to Haitian service. Yeo's action in attacking the Haitian ship, although not officially sanctioned by his commanding officer beforehand, was commended.|$|E
