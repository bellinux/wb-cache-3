40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this 2 -year {{follow-up}} {{study was to investigate}} the long-term effect of <b>Remune</b> as monotherapy for HIV- 1 infection. Background: Participants previously enrolled in the phase II double-blind, randomized, adjuvant-controlled study of the HIV- 1 Immunogen (<b>Remune)</b> were followed for 2 years. Open-label immunization with <b>Remune</b> monotherapy was given to each participant every 12 weeks. <b>Remune,</b> a gp 120 -depleted HIV- 1 that was inactivated in beta-propiolactone and irradiation, was emulsified with mineral oil (incomplete Freund’s adjuvant). Method: In Study 2101 B, the effect of four doses of <b>Remune</b> given every 12 weeks over 40 weeks was compared to placebo in 297 asymptomatic type E HIV-infected patients [Churdboonchart et al., 2000]. A group of 17 volunteers were separated into a subset study and another 57 were excluded from analysis due to discontinuation or addition of other treatments. This 2 -year follow-up study continued with open-label dosing of HIV- 1 Immunogen every 12 weeks for the remaining 223 patients. Changes in CD 4 + cells, CD 8 + cells, and body weight were monitored at each patient visit. Results: Overall, immunizations were safe; commo...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} immune stimulation by a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) immunogen (<b>Remune)</b> compared to a non-HIV vaccine (influenza) on HIV- 1 -specific immune responses in HIV- 1 -seropositive subjects. HIV- 1 p 24 antigen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was not augmented after immunization with the influenza vaccine. In contrast, subjects increased their lymphocyte proliferative responses to p 24 antigen after one immunization with HIV- 1 immunogen (<b>Remune)</b> (gp 120 -depleted inactivated HIV- 1 in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant). Furthermore, p 24 antigen-stimulated β-chemokine production (RANTES, MIP- 1 α, MIP- 1 β) was also augmented after immunization with the HIV- 1 immunogen but not influenza vaccine. Taken together, {{these results suggest that}} in this cohort, HIV-specific immune responses to p 24 antigen can be augmented after immunization with an HIV- 1 immunogen. The ability to upregulate immune responses to the more conserved core proteins may have important implications in the development of immunotherapeutic interventions for HIV- 1 infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of multiple subtypes of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) worldwide has created new challenges {{for the development of}} both therapeutic and preventive AIDS vaccines. We examined T-helper proliferative responses to HIV- 1 clade A, B, C, G, and E whole-killed virus and to HIV- 1 clade G and B core (p 24) antigens in HIV- 1 -infected subjects taking potent antiviral drugs who received HIV immunogen (<b>Remune)</b> therapeutic vaccination. Subjects who were immunized mounted strong proliferative responses to both whole virus and core antigens of the different clades. These results suggest that a whole-killed immunogen may have broad applications as a therapeutic as well as a preventive vaccine in the current multiclade HIV- 1 pandemic...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fully {{functional}} HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 and CD 4 effector T-cell {{responses are}} vital to the containment of viral activity and disease progression. These responses are lacking in HIV- 1 -infected patients with progressive disease. We attempted to augment fully functional HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 and CD 4 effector T-cell responses in patients with advanced chronic HIV- 1 infection. Design: Chronically infected patients with low CD 4 counts T-cell counts who commenced antiretroviral therapy (ART) were subsequently treated with combined interleukin- 2 and therapeutic vaccination. Methods: Thirty six anti-retroviral naive patients were recruited and initiated on combination ART for 17 weeks before randomization to: A) ongoing ART alone; B) ART with IL- 2 twice daily for 5 days every four weeks starting at week 17 for 3 cycles; C) ART with IL- 2 as in group B and <b>Remune</b> HIV- 1 vaccine administered once every 3 months, starting at week 17; and D) ART with <b>Remune</b> vaccine as in group C. Patients were studied for 65 weeks following commencement of ART, with an additional prior 6 week lead-in observation period. CD 4 and CD 8 T-cell counts, evaluations of HIV- 1 RNA levels and proliferative responses to recall and HIV- 1 antigens were complemented with assessment of IL- 4 -secretion alongside quantification of anti-HIV- 1 CD 8 T-cell responses and neutralizing antibody titres. Results: Neither IL- 2 nor Remune™ vaccination induced sustained HIV- 1 -specific T-cell responses. However, we report an inverse relationship between HIV- 1 -specific proliferative responses and IL- 4 production which continuously increased in patients receiving immunotherapy, but not patients receiving ART alone. Conclusion: Induction of HIV- 1 -specific cell-mediated responses is a major challenge in chronically HIV- 1 -infected patients even when combining immunisation with IL- 2 therapy. An antigen-specific IL- 4 -associated suppressive response {{may play a role}} in attenuating HIV-specific responses. © 2007 Hardy et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E
40|$|We treated {{a cohort}} of 38 HIV-infected {{individuals}} with a therapeutic vaccine (<b>Remune,</b> HIV- 1 Immunogen) in an open label study. We then determined whether baseline parameters, such as CD 4 cell count, viral load and IgG levels, were predictive {{of the magnitude of}} the HIV-specific lymphocyte proliferative responses (LPRs). We demonstrate herein that there is a significant enhancement from baseline for both HIV and p 24 antigen-stimulated LPRs after immunization. Using a responder definition of a stimulation index of > 5 on at least two post-immunization time-points, 29 / 38 (76 %) responded to HIV- 1 antigen while 27 / 38 (71 %) responded to native p 24 antigen. Viral load and total IgG were negatively correlated, while CD 4 cell counts were positively associated with the magnitude of the HIV antigen LPR. In a multivariable analysis, baseline CD 4 was the best predictor of HIV antigen LPR post-immunization...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} HIV- 1 antigen specific intracellular {{expression of}} perforin on CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes {{in subjects with}} chronic HIV- 1 infection on antiviral drug therapy after immunization with a gp 120 -depleted, whole killed HIV- 1 immunogen (inactivated, gp 120 -depleted HIV- 1 in IFA, <b>Remune).</b> Based upon previous results, we hypothesized that the restoration of adequate T helper immune responses by vaccination against HIV- 1 {{could result in the}} augmentation of CD 8 + lymphocyte immune responses measured as perforin expression. In the current study we observed an increase in the frequency of perforin in CD 8 + lymphocytes in HIV infected individuals immunized with a gp 120 -depleted HIV- 1 immunogen while on antiviral drug therapy. Furthermore, the frequency of HIV-specific CD 8 + perforin expressing cells correlated with the T helper immune response as measured by the lymphocyte proliferative response (LPR). The induction of such responses with immunization may have direct antiviral consequences and is being studied inm ongoing clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|There are {{currently}} an estimated 33. 2 million {{people living with}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide. For these individuals, long-term use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is not feasible {{for a variety of}} reasons including major adverse complications, multi-drug resistance, poor adherence, and high cost. Hence, development of novel therapeutic strategies that can reduce the life-long dependency on cART is highly desired. In order to develop effective therapeutic strategies such as a therapeutic vaccine, we need to have a greater understanding of the immune correlates of viral control in chronic HIV infection. In this thesis, we used treatment interruption (TI) as a tool to test the efficacy of several therapeutic approaches and immune parameters for their association with effective control of viral replication. In Chapter 2 we showed that cART intensification and <b>Remune</b> vaccination resulted in reduced viral load (VL) plateau during sequential TIs. Although HIV-specific immune responses measured by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) increased in the same time frame, neither their breadth nor magnitude correlated with the decrease in VL plateau. In Chapter 3 the effect of ALVAC-vCP 1425 plus <b>Remune</b> vaccination on HIV proteome-wide HIV-specific responses was monitored using a dual color IFN-gamma/interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) ELISPOT assay. We observed an increase in the magnitude of HIV-specific IFN-gamma/IL- 2 responses, as well as in the breadth of Gag-specific IFN-gamma responses in the vaccinated groups compared to placebo groups. A shift towards an increased contribution of Gag-specific responses to total HIV-specific vaccine induced immune response was associated with longer delay to viral rebound during TI. In Chapters 4 and 5, we examined baseline pre-TI immune parameters and their association with viral rebound and CD 4 count change during TI in HIV-infected individuals in the chronic phase of infection experiencing virologic failure before TI (Chapter 4) or with different levels of VL control while on therapy prior to TI (Chapter 5). We saw that chronic antigen stimulation from persistent viremia as well as co-infections such as with cytomegalovirus are associated with T-cell senescence, which may result in less favourable clinical outcomes during TI. Consequently, results from this thesis contribute to further understanding of immune correlates of viral control in chronic HIV infection. New therapeutic vaccines and interventions should induce polyfunctional HIV-specific immune responses, broad Gag-specific immune responses, as well as reducing chronic antigen stimulation to prevent irreversible T-cell exhaustion. Taken together, these insights could potentially lead to the development of novel treatment interventions that could effectively control viral replication off cART...|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} this study lies {{in the ability of}} the authors to draw {{together}} their findings and present clear policy implications and specific recommendations. They point to the fact that while the individual’s life experiences may be the context from which they move into care work recruitment strategies need to be life-course sensitive if the provision of high quality childcare is the ulti-mate goal of the sector. Moreover, there needs to be ongoing training, support and supervision together with the introduction of family-friendly policies and practices. The authors point out that the recruitment of childcare workers is becom-ing increasingly difficult given the predominantly female workforce which is, in general, becoming more highly skilled and (in some instances) better <b>remune</b> rated. The end result {{is likely to be a}} rapid decrease in the availability of both men and women willing to undertake the care of vulnerable chil-dren unless the financial rewards are increased, training is provided and status issues are addressed. More broadly, Brannen and her colleagues suggest the need for a more radical re- evaluation of the nature and purpose of care work with vulnerable children. In brief, this volume is a valuable contribution to the childcare literature not least because it fills a gap in our understanding of the context, both past and present, of the lives of care workers. In addition, it brings together a number of fascinating findings across the four groups studied and outlines concrete policy recommendations for change with the ultimate aim of provi-ding the very best care experiences for vulnerable children...|$|E
