40|$|With the {{development}} of modern computer networks, a new advanced channel for communication emerges. The future Swedish defence will use multiple systems connected with high-speed networks for information sharing. Within this environment, the issue of administration of authorisation is crucial. SaabTech Systems and SICS have in collaboration developed a model and a prototype for decentralised administration of authorisations. The model is based on delegation of authorisations extended with a component to define constraints on delegations. This enables efficient decentralised administration that reflects the management structure of an organization in a natural way, {{at the same time}} as it maintains centralised control on the distribution of authorisations. All authorisations must fulfil constraints defined by their sources of authority. The source of authority may, for instance, define in advance how a certain authorisation can be distributed and used, in terms of whom and when it can be delegated. The model supports several schemes for <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorization...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{security}} of sensitive {{data and the}} safety of control signal are two core issues in industrial control system (ICS). However, the preva-lence of USB storage devices brings a great challenge on protecting ICS in those respects. Unfortunately, there is currently no solution especially for ICS to provide a complete defense against data transmission between untrusted USB storage devices and critical equipment without forbidding normal USB device function. This paper proposes a trust management scheme of USB storage devices for ICS (TMSUI). By fully considering the background of application scenarios, TMSUI is designed based on security chip to achieve authoring a certain USB storage device to only access some exact protected terminals in ICS for a particular period of time. The issues about digital forensics and <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> are discussed. The prototype system is finally implemented and the e-valuation on it indicates that TMSUI effectively meets the security goals with high compatibility and good performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We propose two {{extensions}} to {{the authorization}} model for relational databases defined originally by Griffiths and Wade. The first extension concerns {{a new type}} of revoke operation, called noncascading revoke operation. The original model contains a single, cascading revoke operation, meaning that when a privilege is revoked from a user, a recursive revocation takes place that deletes all authorizations granted by this user that do not have other supporting authorizations. The new type <b>of</b> <b>revocation</b> avoids the recursive <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorizations.</b> The second extension concerns negative authorization which permits specification of explicit denial for a user to access an object under a particular mode. We also address the management of views and groups with respect to the proposed extensions.

40|$|International audienceDynamic {{workflow}} adjustment studies how to minimally adjust existing user-task assignments, when {{a sudden}} change occurs, e. g. absence of users, {{so that all}} tasks are being attended and no constraint is violated. In particular, we study two key questions: (i) Will the workflow still be satisfiable given a change? (ii) If the answer is yes, {{how to find a}} satisfying assignment with the minimum perturbation to the old system? We consider various types of changes, including absence of a user, addition of a separation-of-duty constraint, addition of a binding-of-duty constraint, and <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> a user-to-task <b>authorization,</b> study their theoretical properties and formulate them into the well-studied Boolean satisfiability problem, which enables a system engineer without much technical background to solve problems by using standard satisfiability solvers. A step further, towards more efficient solutions for our specific problems, we propose customized algorithms by adapting and tailoring the state-of-art algorithms inside standard solvers. Our work would have implications for business process management, staffing, and cost planning...|$|R

Failure to comply with any policy or contractual term may result in the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>authorization</b> <b>of</b> a UCSC department or program to operate as a credit card merchant. This policy incorporates provisions from a number of UC policies. In cases where a comprehensive reference is needed, the UC policy should be consulted. Where conflicts exist between this policy and UC policies, UC policies shall take precedence. Please refer to Section III for the definitions of important terms used in this policy. II. Detailed Policy Statement A. General Provisions A department or program seeking to function as a UCSC credit card merchant must meet the following eligibility requirements: 1. Self-Sustaining Activity. Activity must be primarily self-sustaining. This means the business activity for which the department wishes to accept credit cards must generate net revenue. Activities may include such things as admission to events and facilities, the sale of merchandise, and the acceptance of payment of certain fees. The requesting department must specify the activities for which it wishes to accept credit cards as payment. 2. Sales Volume. Activity must have a significant sales volume...|$|R

For the reasons included high abstract and the authorization hard to be managed, a new model was putted forward to administrate usage control mode 1 ——RUCON model. Six functions <b>of</b> <b>authorizations,</b> which are user-role auto-assignment based on role-rule, role-hierarchy assignment, permissions-role assignment, usage-rule, obligations and conditions were defined in the new model. In order to simplify the management the new model adopted {{the advantages of the}} RBAC model. In the RUCON model the assignment and <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> right are administrated automatically through the medium of roles. The formal description of the RUCON model was given as well.

40|$|Grid {{delegation}} is {{the procedure}} {{by which a}} valid user endows another user or a program or service {{with the ability to}} act on that user’s behalf. Delegation is the primary form <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> in grids. The large and geographically distributed, dynamic, heterogeneous and scalable grid environment poses unique delegation requirements. Presently there are no standard mechanisms to guide grid delegation. As credential delegation has its own limitations in a dynamic grid environment, a new conceptual model is required to effectively formulate the grid delegation requirements. In this paper, we present a framework called Role-Based Grid Delegation Model (RB-GDM) for delegating access rights in grids. The basic unit of delegation in our model is role. Derived from the standard RBAC formalisms, this framework explores various approaches for <b>authorization</b> and <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> delegation...|$|R
