5|$|Two {{months before}} the 1997 election, the party gained an MP in the House of Commons when George Gardiner, the Conservative MP for Reigate, {{switched}} allegiance to the <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> after his local Conservative branch deselected him due to critical comments {{that he had made}} about Major.|$|E
5|$|In the {{build-up}} to the 1997 general election, the <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> {{spent more}} on press advertising {{than either the}} incumbent Conservatives or their main rival, the Labour Party. It stood candidates in 547 constituencies, more than any minor party had ever fielded in a UK election. Ultimately, it gained 811,827 votes, representing 2.6% of the national total. Support was strongest in southern and eastern England, and weakest in inner London, northern England, and Scotland. The party failed to win any seats in the House of Commons. Following the election, psephologists argued {{that the impact of}} the <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> deprived Conservative candidates of victory in somewhere between four and sixteen parliamentary seats. In the months following the election, the party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith died in July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members reformed as a Eurosceptic pressure group called the Democracy Movement, and many others joined Eurosceptic political parties like the UK Independence Party and the Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|In the election, {{which took}} place on 1 May 1997, the <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> polled 811,827 votes. This {{represented}} 2.6% of the national total, and the party averaged 3.1% in the seats which it contested. 42 of the party's candidates gained over 5% of the vote and thus saw the return of their deposits, which were then priced at £500 each; 505 deposits were lost.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{announcing the}} <b>referendums,</b> <b>party</b> leaders {{were invited to}} a cross-party group. The purpose of the cross-party group was to review draft {{legislation}} allowing for the referenda to take place, and to nominate candidates for a Flag Consideration Panel by mid February 2015.|$|R

5|$|A distant kinsman of the assassin, Henry Bellingham, became Conservative MP for North West Norfolk in 1983, {{and held}} junior {{office in the}} Cameron–Clegg {{coalition}} of 2010–15. When he temporarily lost his seat in 1997—he regained it in 2001—his narrow defeat was widely regarded as arising from the intervention of Roger Percival, the candidate for the <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> whose votes largely came from disgruntled Conservatives. Despite the different spelling, media accounts asserted Percival's descent from the assassinated Prime Minister's family, and reported the defeat as a belated form of revenge.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> was a Eurosceptic, single-issue {{political}} party that {{was active in}} the United Kingdom from 1994 to 1997. The party's sole objective was for a referendum to be held {{on the nature of the}} UK's membership of the European Union (EU). Specifically, it called for a referendum on whether the British people wanted to either be part of a federal European state or revert to being a sovereign nation that was part of a free-trade bloc without wider political functions.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} election, the <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith had been {{suffering}} from pancreatic cancer, and had been warned that competing the election would shorten his life. Goldsmith died in Benahavis, Spain on 18 July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members transformed into the Democracy Movement, a pressure group {{closely associated with the}} former Conservative supporter and multi-millionaire businessman Paul Sykes. The Eurosceptic cause was weakened, however; with Blair's firmly pro-EU government in power, by 1998 the possibility of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU was considered as distant as it had been in 1995.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-French {{businessman}} James Goldsmith {{announced the}} formation of the <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> on 27 November 1994. Goldsmith had once been a strong supporter of the EEC but had grown disenchanted with it during the early 1990s, becoming particularly concerned that it was forming into a superstate governed by centralised institutions in Brussels. He opposed the Maastricht Treaty, believing that it resulted in increased German dominance in Europe. As an economic protectionist, he was also critical of the EU's signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, believing that global free trade would damage both the EU's economy and his own business interests.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> {{decided not}} to contest any of the by-elections {{that took place in}} 1996 and 1997. For the 1997 general election, it hurried its {{selection}} of candidates, who had only one interview—and no background checks or screening—before acceptance. The funding for each candidate's official campaign was supplied entirely by the party centre. Candidates were brought to a training day at a Manchester hotel in February 1997, where they were presented with several hours of speeches and given a handbook. Many felt that the event had been a public relations exercise rather than a concerted effort to train candidates.|$|E
5|$|The general {{election}} {{resulted in a}} victory for Tony Blair's Labour Party, which adopted a pro-EU stance. Their victory was considered a landslide, thus making the Referendum Party's role in the election fairly irrelevant. The Conservatives had gained only 30.7% of the vote, a drop from the 41.9% they had attained in 1992 and the lowest vote share that they had received since the establishment of modern British party politics in 1832. Their representation in the House of Commons fell by over half, from 343 to 165; their lowest representation in the House since 1906. The reasons for their electoral decline were many {{and the impact of}} the <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> was not a major factor.|$|E

5|$|Before {{establishing}} the party, Mike Nattrass {{had long been}} involved with Britain's Eurosceptic movement. In 1994, Nattrass joined the New Britain Party and unsuccessfully stood for the group in the Dudley West by-election of the same year. Alike most New Britain candidates, Nattrass was absorbed into and stood in Solihull for the single-issue <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> at the 1997 general election. Led by James Goldsmith, this party's policy was for a referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU), specifically {{as to whether the}} British population {{wanted to be part of}} a federal European state or whether they wanted the EU to revert to being a free-trade bloc without wider political functions. Nattrass subsequently joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and eventually rose to the positions of Party Chairman and Deputy Leader. As the UKIP candidate, he was elected as a representative for the West Midlands constituency in the 2004 European Parliament election, and was re-elected in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} year, the <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> had little {{established}} organisation and largely remained a concept with limited concrete presence. Goldsmith's finances had allowed its appearance {{to be accompanied}} with mass publicity but it lacked the standard machinery of a political party, such as a mass membership or politically experienced personnel. To counter this problem, Goldsmith sought to create a sophisticated administrative centre and to secure the expertise {{to carry out a}} political campaign, establishing his headquarters in London. By October 1995, the party had established a hierarchical structure consisting of three tiers: the centre, region and constituency. Operating the centre was Goldsmith and a cabinet whose membership included Lord McAlpine, who was a former treasurer of the Conservative Party, and two former members of the Conservative Central Office staff. The centre had around 50 staff, who relayed Goldsmith's instructions through to the ten regional co-ordinators, who in turn transmitted them to the prospective candidates in the constituencies. This top-down and undemocratic structure concentrated decision making with Goldsmith and the centre and provided little autonomy for the regions and constituencies, although this was deemed necessary to ensure efficiency in its campaign.|$|E
5|$|The party gained over 7% in four constituencies. Much media {{attention}} {{was focused on}} the seat of Putney, where Goldsmith had stood as the Referendum candidate against incumbent Conservative MP David Mellor; Goldsmith secured 3.5% of the local vote and the seat was won by the Labour candidate. Although it failed to win any seats, the party exhibited the strongest performance of a minor party in recent UK political history. Support had been strongest in the south and east of England, in particular in areas with high elderly populations and high rates of agricultural employment. Support for the party was considerably weaker in Inner London, Northern England, and Scotland; it secured only 1.1% of the Scottish vote. This may have reflected greater pro-EU sentiment in Scotland or a perception that the Referendum Party's Euroscepticism was a form of English nationalism rather than British nationalism. The <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> had proved more electorally successful than its Eurosceptic rival, UKIP, which averaged 1.2% of the vote in the 194 constituencies that it contested.|$|E

25|$|In {{an article}} for The Spectator in May 2001 Tebbit claimed that retired British {{security}} service agents from the Foreign Office had infiltrated James Goldsmith's <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> in the 1990s and then later infiltrated United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). Tebbit called for an independent enquiry into the matter.|$|E
25|$|UKIP contested the 1994 European Parliament {{election}} {{with little}} financing and much infighting, securing {{itself as the}} fifth largest party in that election with 1% of the vote. During this period, UKIP {{was viewed as a}} typical single-issue party by commentators, some of whom drew comparisons with the French Poujadist movement. Following the election, UKIP lost much support to the Referendum Party; founded by the multi-millionaire James Goldsmith in 1994, it shared UKIP's Eurosceptic approach but was far better funded. In the 1997 general election, UKIP fielded 194 candidates and secured 0.3% of the national vote; only one of its candidates, Nigel Farage in Salisbury, secured over 5% of the vote and had his deposit returned. UKIP was beaten by the <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> in 163 of the 165 seats in which they stood against each other. The <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> disbanded following Goldsmith's death later that year and many of its candidates joined UKIP.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party,</b> {{which sought}} a {{referendum}} on the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union, came fourth in terms of votes with 800,000 votes mainly from former Conservative voters, but won no seats in parliament. The six parties with the next highest votes stood only in either Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales; in order, they were the Scottish National Party, the Ulster Unionist Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Plaid Cymru, Sinn Féin, and the Democratic Unionist Party.|$|E

Members included Bill English (Finance Minister {{and leader of the}} group), Jonathan Young (representing National), Trevor Mallard (representing Labour), Kennedy Graham (representing Green), Marama Fox (representing Māori), David Seymour (representing ACT) and Peter Dunne (representing United Future). New Zealand First refused to participate.|$|E
25|$|Australians {{reacted to}} the event with {{widespread}} shock and horror, and the political effects were significant and long-lasting. The federal government led state governments, some of which (notably Tasmania itself and Queensland) were opposed to new gun laws, to severely restrict the availability of firearms. While surveys showed up to 85% of Australians 'supported gun control', many people opposed the new laws. Concern was raised within the Coalition Government that fringe {{groups such as the}} 'Ausi Freedom Scouts', the Australian League of Rights and the Citizen Initiated <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party,</b> were exploiting voter anger to gain support. After discovering that the Christian Coalition and US National Rifle Association were supporting the gun lobby, the government and media cited their support, along with the moral outrage of the community to discredit the gun lobby as extremists.|$|E
25|$|UKIP {{originated}} as the Anti-Federalist League, a single-issue Eurosceptic party {{established in}} London by the historian Alan Sked in 1991. It was renamed UKIP in 1993 but its growth remained slow; {{it was largely}} eclipsed by the Eurosceptic <b>Referendum</b> <b>Party</b> until the latter's 1997 dissolution. In 1997, Sked was ousted by a faction led by Nigel Farage, who became the party's preeminent figure. In 2006, Farage officially became leader and under his direction the party adopted a wider policy platform and capitalised on concerns about rising immigration, in particular among the White British working class. This resulted in significant breakthroughs at the 2013 local elections, 2014 European elections, and 2015 general election. The pressure UKIP exerted on the government {{is widely regarded as}} the main reason for the 2016 referendum which led to the decision to withdraw from the European Union. Following the referendum, Farage stepped down as UKIP leader and the party's vote share heavily declined.|$|E
