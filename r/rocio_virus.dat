40|$|Abstract. We {{report a}} {{simplified}} reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method for identifi-cation of Brazilian flaviviruses {{based on the}} patterns of electrophoretic separation of the amplicons. The RT-PCR was done on the culture fluids of Aedes albopictus C 6 / 36 cells infected with Brazilian flaviviruses, without previous extraction of viral RNA, using Flavivirus universal primers that anneal to highly conserved sequences within the nonstructural protein 5 and 39 - non translated region of the virus genome. Genomes of 13 Brazilian Flavivirus isolates were amplified. It {{was not possible to}} amplify the genome of Bussuquara virus. Analysis of the RT-PCR products gave reproducible results and three distinct amplicon patterns were observed. Cacipacore ́ (800 – 850 basepairs [bp]) and yellow fever viruses (600 bp) yielded a single amplicon; dengue virus types 1 and 2 (650 and 550 bp), dengue virus type 4 (550 and 450 bp), Iguape (650 – 600 bp and 750 – 700 bp), St. Louis encephalitis (700 and 650 – 600 bp), and <b>Rocio</b> <b>viruses</b> (600 and 500 – 550 bp) yielded two amplicons; and Ilhéus virus yielded five amplicons, two larger than 1, 000 bp, one 650 – 700 bp, one 550 – 600 bp, and one 450 – 500 bp. The analysis of amplicon DNA sequences of six viruses showed homology with the 39 - nontranslated region of Flavivirus genome.

50|$|Rocio viral {{encephalitis}} is {{an epidemic}} flaviviral disease of humans first observed in São Paulo State, Brazil, in 1975.

If migratory {{species of birds}} are, or become involved in, the virus transmission cycle, the competency {{of a wide variety}} of mosquito species for transmitting <b>Rocio</b> <b>virus</b> experimentally suggest that the virus may become more widely distributed.

[...] Studies with mosquitoes from the epidemic zone after the outbreak showed that Psorophora ferox and Ochlerotatus scapularis {{could be classified as}} potential vectors, but Ochlerotatus serratus was relatively insusceptible. Field investigations in the late 1970s and 1980s showed that Ochlerotatus scapularis, Ochlerotatus serratus and species of Culex (Melanoconion) were the predominant mosquitoes in the epidemic zone, and that Ochlerotatus scapularis was the most common and abundant mosquito in human settlements and human-made environments. Outside the epidemic zone, laboratory studies have shown that Culex tarsalis mosquitoes from Arizona and Culex pipiens pipiens mosquitoes from Illinois were relatively efficient experimental vectors; Tennessee Culex pipiens subspecies and Argentina Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus were moderately efficient experimental vectors; Louisiana Psorophora ferox, and Culex nigripalpus and Culex (Melanoconion) opisthopus from Florida were relatively inefficient experimental vectors. Psorophora ferox and Aedes scapularis were shown to be susceptible to per os infection with <b>Rocio</b> <b>virus</b> and could transmit the virus by bite following an incubation period, whereas infection rates in Ochlerotatus serratus did not exceed 36% and an ID50 could not be calculated for this species so it is unlikely to be an epidemiologically important vector of <b>Rocio</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E

40|$|St. Louis {{encephalitis}} (SLE) virus normally infects {{birds and}} is transmitted between birds by mosquito vectors. Thus {{it is an}} arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus). SLE virus is found throughout the Americas, and human disease has been reported from the nor- thern part of the hemisphere. Human epidemics have been reported only from northern Mexico (Gonzalez Cortes, et al. 1975), the United States, and southern Canada (CDC 1977). Other viruses closely related to SLE (dengue, yellow fever, and <b>Rocio</b> <b>viruses)</b> cause epidemics in Central and South America. In the United States, SLE {{is the most important}} mosquito-borne disease of humans {{in terms of the number}} of cases and fatalities, and birds are the usual source of SLE virus for mosquitoes that infect humans. Human cases have been reported from all regions of the U. S. and from most of the states, but epidemics occur predominantly in the Mississippi and Ohio River watersheds, Texas, and Florida. The intensity of human cases oscillates dramatically over a 6 - 10 year period, with epidemic levels of disease spanning several years. The last peak of human SLE occurred in 1975; and only a few sporadic cases have been reported in the past three years (Vector-Borne Diseases Division 1977 a, 1978 a, 1979 a). The infection in humans has a spectrum of responses: no apparent illness; mild illness with slight fever; febrile headache, often with nausea and vomiting; aseptic meningitis with sudden onset of fever and neck stiffness; and encephalitis with fever and symptoms of disorientation, confusion, stupor or coma, tremors of the face or hands, neck rigidity with or without paralysis, and occasionally death, particularly in individuals over 55 years of age (Brinker and Monath 1980). Human infection and disease are a result of an extension of SLE virus transmission out of the natural bird-mosquito cycle. Humans are dead- end hosts for the virus and therefore do not contribute to additional transmission or maintenance...|$|R

Com o propósito de estabelecer a prevalência de infecções por esses agentes em reserva ecológica, localizada naquela área, pesquisou-se a presença de anticorpos, bem como suas possíveis associações com características individuais e familiares dos investigados. MÉTODOS: Pesquisaram-se anticorpos para os antígenos dos <b>vírus</b> <b>Rocio</b> (ROC), Ilhéus (ILH), encefalite de St. Louis (SLE), encefalites eqüinas do leste (EEE), oeste (WEE) e venezuelana (VEE), em 182 pessoas pertencentes a 58 famílias residentes na Estação Ecológica de Juréia-Itatins, utilizando-se testes de inibição de hemaglutinação e neutralização com redução de placas. Usou-se Mac-Elisa para pesquisar anticorpos IgM para os vírus ROC, ILH e EEE. RESULTADOS: Foi observada a presença de anticorpos para todos os arbovírus testados, com exceção do vírus WEE. A prevalência total de anticorpos foi 26, 9 % (21, 4 % para alfavírus e 12, 6 % para flavivírus). Não foram encontrados anticorpos IgM.

Paulo State, Brazil, showed an intense circulation of pathogenic arboviruses in the region. The goal was to verify the prevalence of arboviral infections in people living at the local ecological, and its potential association with these population' individual and familiar characteristics. METHODS: The study was carried out among 182 persons of 58 families to identify the presence of antibodies to the following viruses: Rocio (ROC), Ilheus (ILH), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEE), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE). Inhibition hemagglutination test and plaque reduction neutralization test were the laboratory assays of choice. MAC-ELISA was used to identify IgM antibodies to ROC, ILH and EEE viruses. RESULTS: The prevalence of antibodies was 26. 9 % (21. 4 % to alphavirus and 12. 6 % to flavivirus). There were no antibodies to WEE virus. IgM antibodies were not observed suggesting no recent infection in study population. Among the characteristics investigated, age, occupation, place of birth and the habit of going into the forest were shown to be statistically associated with arboviral infection (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Viral {{encephalitis}} is {{a common}} cause of lethal infections in humans, and several different viruses are documented to be responsible. <b>Rocio</b> <b>virus</b> is a flavivirus that causes a severe lethal encephalitis syndrome in humans and also mice, providing an interesting model to study the CNS compartmentalized immune response. Interleukin 33 (IL- 33), {{a member of the}} IL- 1 family, is an immunomodulatory cytokine that is highly expressed in the CNS. However, the role of IL- 33 on viral encephalitis remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore how the IL- 33 /ST 2 axis regulates the local immune response during <b>Rocio</b> <b>virus</b> infection. Methods: Wild-type (WT), ST 2 (ST 2 −/−), and nitric oxide synthase-deficient mice (iNOS−/−) and Stat 6 (Stat 6 −/−) -deficient mice were infected with different concentrations of the <b>Rocio</b> <b>virus</b> by intraperitoneal route, the cytokine mRNA level in CNS was analyzed by qPCR, and cellular immunophenotyping was performed on infected mice by the flow cytometry of isolated CNS mononuclear cells. Results: We have shown that the mRNA expression of IL- 33 and ST 2 receptors is increased in the CNS of Rocio virus-infected WT mice and that ST 2 −/− mice showed increased susceptibility to infection. ST 2 deficiency was correlated with increased tissue pathology, cellular infiltration, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) mRNA levels and higher viral load in the CNS, compared with wild-type mice. The increased Th 1 cytokine levels released in the CNS acted on infiltrating macrophages, as evidenced by flow cytometry characterization of cellular infiltrates, inducing the expression of iNOS, contributing to brain injury. Moreover, iNOS−/− mice were more resistant to <b>Rocio</b> <b>virus</b> encephalitis, presenting a lower clinical score and reduced mortality rate, despite the increased tissue pathology. Conclusions: We provide evidences of a specific role for IL- 33 receptor signaling in nitric oxide induction through local IFN-γ modulation, suggesting that nitric oxide overproduction might have {{an important role in the}} progression of experimental viral encephalitis...|$|E

Experimental flavivirus infections have {{previously}} demonstrated a persistent infection and, in this study, we investigated {{the persistence of}} ROCV infection in golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). The hamsters were infected intraperitoneally with 9. 8 LD 50 / 0. 02 mL of ROCV and later anaesthetised and sacrificed at various time points over a 120 -day period to collect of blood, urine and organ samples. The viral titres were quantified by real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The specimens were used to infect Vero cells and ROCV antigens in the cells were detected by immunefluorescence assay. The levels of antibodies were determined by the haemagglutination inhibition technique. A histopathological examination {{was performed on the}} tissues by staining with haematoxylin-eosin and detecting viral antigens by immunohistochemistry (IHC). ROCV induced a strong immune response and was pathogenic in hamsters through neuroinvasion. ROCV was recovered from Vero cells exposed to samples from the viscera, brain, blood, serum and urine and was detected by qRT-PCR in the brain, liver and blood for three months after infection. ROCV induced histopathological changes and the expression of viral antigens, which were detected by IHC in the liver, kidney, lung and brain up to four months after infection.

Paulo State, Brazil: 1 - urban zone of Iguape; 2 - Rocio, a peripheric city district of rural characteristics; 3 - zone of extensive banana plantation on the coastal plain; 4 - forested area close to the northern mountain range. It was observed that 8. 31 % of the children presented HI antibodies to arbovirus of groups A, B, C, Bunyamwera, Simbu or Anopheles A. There {{was a significant difference}} between the proportion of positive sera in banana plantation and forest dwellers (19. 05 % and 16. 67 %) and those from the central urban zone and Rocio district (1. 89 % and 3. 81 %). Children who have always lived in the urban zone and do not usually go into the neighboring forest show neutralizing antibodies to Caraparu or <b>Rocio</b> <b>virus,</b> which suggests urban transmission. The absence of specific IGM in positive sera to Rocio probably means that there has been no recent infection by this agent in the school-children under investigation...|$|E
40|$|The Flaviviridae family, Flavivirus genus {{includes}} {{viruses that}} are transmitted to vertebrates by infected mosquitoes or ticks. The genus Flavivirus includes {{a variety of}} viruses that cause diseases such as acute febrile illness, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic fever. Flaviviruses primarily infect blood monocytes and tissue macrophages, which {{have been shown to}} be permissive, supporting viral replication and serving as virus reservoirs. On the other hand, these cells may have an important antiviral activity related to modulation by cytokine production and by the capacity of these cells to synthesize reactive free radicals such as nitric oxide (NO) which can have a microbicidal effect. The present study was performed in order to determine the production of cytokines interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 &# 946;), tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF-&# 945;), transforming growth factor- beta (TGF-&# 946;) and interferon -alpha (IFN-&# 945;) and NO by macrophages infected with one of four Brazilian flaviviruses, Bussuquara virus (BUSV), Yellow Fever virus (YFV), <b>Rocio</b> <b>virus</b> (ROCV) and Encephalitis Saint Louis virus (SLEV), and to verify the possible antiviral effect of NO during macrophage infection with ROCV. Moreover, we asked if the different viruses were able to regulate bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced cytokine production. Our results showed that YFV and SLEV reduced the production of IL- 1 &# 946; and TGF-&# 946; by LPS-stimulated macrophages, while ROCV only diminished LPS-stimulated TGF-&# 946; synthesis. On the other hand, BUSV more likely favored an enhancement of the LPS-induced production of IL- 1 &# 946; by macrophages. Additionally, while most of the viruses stimulated the production of IFN-&# 945;, none of them altered the production of TNF-&# 945; by murine macrophages. Interestingly, all viruses induced synthesis of NO that was not correlated with antiviral activity for ROCV. A família Flaviviridae, gênero flavivírus inclui vírus que são transmitidos para os vertebrados por mosquitos e carrapatos. O gênero flavivirus inclui uma variedade de vírus que causa doenças como febres, encefalites e febres hemorrágicas. Primeiramente, as flaviviroses infectam monócitos do sangue e macrófagos do tecido, o qual tem mostrado ser permissivo, suportando a replicação viral e servindo como reservatório de vírus. Por outro lado, essas células podem ter uma importante atividade antiviral relacionada à modulação pela produção de citocinas e pela capacidade destas células sintetizar reativos de radicais livres como óxido nítrico (NO) o qual tem efeito microbicida. O presente estudo foi realizado a fim de determinar a produção de citocinas interleucina - 1 beta (IL- 1 &# 946;), fator de necrose tumoral-alfa (TNF-&# 945;), fator de crescimento transformador-beta (TGF-&# 946;), interferon - alfa (IFN-&# 945;) e NO pelos macrófagos infectados com os quatros flavivírus como vírus Bussuquara (BUSV), vírus da febre amarela (YFV), vírus Rocio (ROCV) e vírus da Encefalite de Saint Louis (SLEV), e verificar o possível efeito antiviral de NO durante a infecção dos macrófagos com ROCV. Além disso, com os diferentes vírus foram capazes de regular o lipopolissacarídeo bacteriano (LPS) indutor da produção de citocinas. Nossos resultados mostraram que YFV e SLEV reduziram a produção de IL- 1 &# 946; e TGF-&# 946; quando macrófagos foram estimulados pelo LPS, enquanto ROCV somente diminuiu a síntese de TGF-&# 946; estimulada pelo LPS. Entretanto, BUSV favoreceu uma acentuada produção de IL- 1 &# 946; pelos macrófagos estimulados pelo LPS, enquanto os vírus estimularam a produção de IFN-&# 945;, nenhum deles alterou a produção de TNF-&# 945; pelos macrófagos murinos. Interessantemente, todos os vírus induziram a síntese de NO que não esteve correlacionada com a atividade antiviral pelo ROCV...|$|E
