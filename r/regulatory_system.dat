5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a <b>regulatory</b> <b>system</b> {{similar to}} RNA interference. Antisense RNAs are widespread; most {{downregulate}} a gene, {{but a few}} are activators of transcription. One way antisense RNA can act is by binding to an mRNA, forming double-stranded RNA that is enzymatically degraded. There are many long noncoding RNAs that regulate genes in eukaryotes, one such RNA is Xist, which coats one X chromosome in female mammals and inactivates it.|$|E

This article emanates from a two-year analysis of processes towards harmonization of medicines <b>regulatory</b> <b>systems</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed due to low levels of regulatory expertise, high regulatory costs and increasing prevalence of unregistered and counterfeit medicines, African countries are pursuing the feasibility of harmonization of their medicines <b>regulatory</b> <b>systems</b> as a policy option. Some of the challenges for attainment of harmonized cross-national <b>regulatory</b> <b>systems</b> include perennial weaknesses in national medicines <b>regulatory</b> <b>systems</b> and continuous changes in stakeholders, champions, motivations and models for the processes and outputs of harmonization. Confirming the presence of an active agenda towards harmonization of medicines <b>regulatory</b> <b>systems</b> in Africa, this article cautions though that harmonization should not be an isolated activity, but should leverage existing regional integration agendas and political legitimacy, while balancing between commercial and health care interests...|$|R

Protochlorophyllide, however, occurs mostly in the free form and, under light conditions, acts as a photosensitizer, forming highly toxic free radicals.

In angiosperms, this is done at the step of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthetic pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide, as do mutants with a disrupted <b>regulatory</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

25|$|The 1971 Mujib regime {{pursued a}} pro-socialist agenda. In 1972, the {{government}} decided to nationalise all banks to channel {{funds to the}} public sector and to prioritise credit to those sectors that sought to reconstruct the war-torn country – mainly industry and agriculture. However, government control of the wrong sectors prevented these banks from functioning well. This was {{compounded by the fact}} that loans were handed out to the public sector without commercial considerations; banks had poor capital lease, provided poor customer service and lacked all market-based monetary instruments. Because loans were given out without commercial considerations, and because they took a long time to call a non-performing loan, and once they did, recovery under the erstwhile judicial system was so expensive, loan recovery was abysmally poor. While the government made a point of intervening everywhere, it didn't set up a proper <b>regulatory</b> <b>system</b> to diagnose such problems and correct them. Hence, banking concepts like profitability and liquidity were alien to bank managers, and capital adequacy took a backseat.|$|E
25|$|The US has an elaborate, {{interdepartmental}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>system</b> {{to evaluate}} new genetically modified foods and crops. For example, the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 gives the USDA {{the authority to}} oversee the detection, control, eradication, suppression, prevention, or retardation of the spread of plant pests or noxious weeds to protect the agriculture, environment and economy of the US. The act regulates any genetically modified organism that utilizes the genome of a predefined 'plant pest' or any plant not previously categorized. In 2015, Yang successfully deactivated 16 specific genes in the white button mushroom. Since he had not added any foreign DNA to his organism, the mushroom could not be regulated under by the USDA under Section 340.2. Yang's white button mushroom was the first organism genetically modified with the Crispr/cas9 protein system to pass US regulation. In 2016, the USDA sponsored a committee to consider future regulatory policy for upcoming genetic modification techniques. With {{the help of the}} US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, special interests groups met on April 15 to contemplate the possible advancements in genetic engineering within the next 5 years and potential policy regulations that would need to come into play. With the emergence of rogue genetic engineers employing the technology, the FDA has begun issuing new regulations.|$|E

In the book, he discusses {{the failure of the}} United States <b>regulatory</b> <b>system</b> to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published End This Depression Now!, a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy – people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} several emerging transnational <b>regulatory</b> <b>systems</b> that engage, {{but are not}} {{centered on}} state legal systems. Driven primarily by civil society organizations, the new <b>regulatory</b> <b>systems</b> use conventional technical standard setting and certification techniques to establish market-leveraged, social and environmental regulatory programs. These programs resemble state regulatory programs in many important respects, and are increasingly legalized. Individual sectors generally have multiple regulatory programs that compete with, but also mimic and reinforce each other. While forestry is the most developed example, similar patterns are evident in agriculture, fisheries, apparel, and mining, among other sectors. The paper describes the institutional structures and routines of the new <b>regulatory</b> <b>systems,</b> their interactions with state based systems, and some possible broader implications for law and society. Among other things, it notes that the emerging <b>regulatory</b> <b>systems</b> permeate their sectors with increasingly broad and deep rule systems and seek to remain highly dynamic at the same time. The paper closes with a brief discussion of whether the systems might be sketching the outlines of new forms of transnational democracy...|$|R
