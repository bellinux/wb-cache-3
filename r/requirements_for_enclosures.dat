40|$|ERAF: 48430 This {{recommendation}} {{covers the}} <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>enclosures</b> for electrical machines and apparatus {{in which the}} entry of flammable gases or vapours is prevented by maintaining the air (or,other nonflammable gas) within the enclosure at a pressure above that of the external atmosphere. The recommendation is confined to the enclosure itself and to fittings directly associated with the enclosure which are concerned with pressurization. It is acknowledged that careful consideration {{must be given to}} the auxiliary apparatus needed for the supply of the pressurizing medium to the enclosure. Guidance on this and other matters not directly connected with the specification of the enclosure itself is given in an appendix...|$|E
50|$|Early captive-breeding {{programs}} involving clouded leopards {{were not}} very successful, largely due to ignorance of courtship activity among them in the wild. Experience has taught keepers that introducing pairs of clouded leopards {{at a young age}} gives opportunities for the pair to bond and breed successfully. Males have the reputation of being aggressive towards females. Facilities breeding clouded leopards need to provide the female with a secluded, off-exhibit area. Modern breeding programs involve carefully regulated introductions between prospective mating pairs, and take into account the <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> enriched <b>enclosures.</b> Stimulating natural behavior by providing adequate space to permit climbing minimizes stress. This, combined with a feeding program that fulfills the proper dietary requirements, has promoted more successful breeding in recent years.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} parameters that dictate the effectiveness of ventilation system is air change rate. The air change rate provides overall effectiveness of ventilation in an enclosed space {{and it needs to}} be examined with age of air particles to decide about overall effectiveness. Age of air particles is the time air at a location spends inside the enclosure and hence provides useful information about presence of secondary flows. A range of tools have been used to predict local and global effectiveness of a typical ventilation system for a specific work environment. Computational fluid dynamics has proven to be an effective tool in this regard. The present work highlights various issues needed to keep in consideration while designing meeting rooms in busy manufacturing environments. Two meeting room configurations have been proposed and ventilation <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> these <b>enclosures</b> have been estimated. Furthermore for two different fan configurations, interior enclosure conditions have been predicted...|$|R
40|$|The Motorola Exhaust Optimization Program strives toward {{identifying}} the optimum exhaust <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> gas panel <b>enclosures</b> to help conserve energy and provide future exhaust capacity for new tools. Various Motorola {{studies have shown}} that at least 20 % of total fab electrical usage is attributed to make-up air fans, exhaust fans, and chilled water systems for recirculation and make-up air. This is equivalent to over 35 million kWh per a year for a typical Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (SPS) fab. These obtained studies have prompted Motorola to focus on a broad range of energy conservation projects. This paper will focus on exhaust optimization through tracer gas testing. Testing has resulted in exhaust and make-up air reductions of as high as 70 % of manufacturer's specifications per gas enclosure. This approach leads to energy conservation and infrastructure cost avoidance for new exhaust fans, ductwork, abatement equipment, and make-up air systems...|$|R
40|$|The Hydrogen Safety Panel {{brings a}} broad {{cross-section}} of expertise from the industrial, government, and academic sectors to help advise the U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Fuel Cell Technologies Office through its work in hydrogen safety, codes, and standards. The Panel’s initiatives in reviewing safety plans, conducting safety evaluations, identifying safety-related technical data gaps, and supporting safety knowledge tools and databases cover {{the gamut from}} research and development to demonstration and deployment. The Panel’s recent work {{has focused on the}} safe deployment of hydrogen and fuel cell systems in support of DOE efforts to accelerate fuel cell commercialization in early market applications: vehicle refueling, material handling equipment, backup power for warehouses and telecommunication sites, and portable power devices. This paper resulted from observations and considerations stemming from the Panel’s work on early market applications. This paper focuses on hydrogen system components that are installed in outdoor enclosures. These enclosures might alternatively be called “cabinets,” but for simplicity, they are all referred to as “enclosures” in this paper. These enclosures can provide a space where a flammable mixture of hydrogen and air might accumulate, creating the potential for a fire or explosion should an ignition occur. If the enclosure is large enough for a person to enter, and ventilation is inadequate, the hydrogen concentration could be high enough to asphyxiate a person who entered the space. Manufacturers, users, and government authorities rely on requirements described in codes to guide safe design and installation of such systems. Except <b>for</b> small <b>enclosures</b> used <b>for</b> hydrogen gas cylinders (gas cabinets), fuel cell power systems, and the enclosures that most people would describe as buildings, there are no hydrogen safety <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> these <b>enclosures,</b> leaving gaps that must be addressed. This paper proposes that a technical basis be developed to enable code bodies to write <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> the range of enclosures from the smallest to the largest...|$|R

40|$|We use Taylor series plus an {{enclosure}} of {{the remainder}} term to validate {{the existence of a}} unique solution for initial value problems in ordinary differential equations and to compute a coarse enclosure of that solution. The significance of this result is its application to Lohner's AWA algorithm for validated solutions, not to the theory of ordinary differential equations. By using high-order Taylor series in Lohner's Algorithm I, we are able to validate the solution over much longer time steps than is done in the current AWA code. <b>For</b> Lohner's <b>enclosure</b> by polynomials, the enclosures are expensive to compute, but it is easy to check <b>for</b> <b>enclosure.</b> <b>For</b> our <b>enclosure</b> by Taylor series, the enclosures are free because they are already being computed, but checking <b>for</b> <b>enclosure</b> requires 2 Θ n polynomial rootfindings.
