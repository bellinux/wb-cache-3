This is evident in the increasing number of people registered at institutions providing education. One of the educational institutions is "X" University in Surabaya which participates in fulfilling the society 2 ̆ 7 s needs of knowledge. This research was conducted to find out and elaborate the evaluation results on post-occupied classrooms towards the room formation elements (floors, ceilings, walls), the <b>room</b> <b>conditioning</b> elements (lighting, atmosphere, acoustic systems, circulations, and interior designs), and the room filling elements (furniture) as well as the comfort of the classroom occupants of the Interior Design major in "X" University in Surabaya. The methods used for this research is Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE) and qualitative-quantitative methodology to obtain any available information from the 11 classes that have been observed individually to come to solid evidence. The research results show that every class has more or less similar problems related to the room formation elements (floors, ceilings, walls), the <b>room</b> <b>conditioning</b> elements (lighting, atmosphere, acoustic systems, circulations, and interior designs), and the room filling elements (furniture), so some alternative solutions have been formulated regarding the material choices for the classrooms...|$|E
40|$|At {{the time}} of {{independence}} milk production in India was only 17 million tones perannum. Today India has become number one in milk production, producing 127 milliontones per annum with approx. 20 % of the total milk production is handled by theorganized sectors. Dairy and food industries are fast growing industries and day-by-daynewer technologies are being introduced to get better quality of foods. Use ofconventional energy is common practice for major processing of milk. At present all mostall dairy operations are performed using grid supply with diesel gen-set as backup. Milkprocurement system has changed in India and now milk is being procured by maintainingcold chain to improve its microbial quality. The village level co-operative societies for milkcollections are provided by bulk milk coolers operating on conventional grid supply ofelectricity and in case of unavailability of electric supply diesel generator sets are providedfor cooling the milk. To overcome the problem of continuous grid supply of electricityand diesel generator sets, solar based refrigeration system for milk cooling at society levelis quiet feasible. Most of the milk processing operations, <b>room</b> <b>conditioning</b> for milkproduct packaging and cold stores for milk & milk products are operating on grid electricsupply. To overcome problem of peak load penalty, the part load can be shared by solarbased vapour absorption system for such operations. The use of solar energy in the dairyis generally found for hot water supply to boiler, hot water generator for processing ofmilk or for CIP cleaning. The field level application of solar based refrigeration system formilk cooling and solar based vapour absorption system for commercial application formilk and milk related cooling operations and for <b>room</b> <b>conditioning</b> for cold stores andpackaging rooms for milk and milk products are minimum. There is an urgent need todevelop commercially viable solar based refrigeration system for such applications.

Studies on the future energy demand under climate change which also take into account future changes of the building stock, renovation measures and heating systems are still lacking. We provide the first analysis of the combined effect of these four influencing factors on the future energy demand for <b>room</b> <b>conditioning</b> of residential buildings and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Germany until 2060. We show that the heating energy demand will decrease substantially in the future. This shift will mainly depend {{on the number of}} renovated buildings and climate change scenarios and only slightly on demographic changes. The future cooling energy demand will remain low in the future unless the amount of air conditioners strongly increases. As a strong change in the German energy mix is not expected, the future GHG emissions caused by heating will mainly depend on the energy demand for future heating.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to explore}} how {{meaningful}} energy benchmarks—reflecting good energy management and design—can be constructed for hospital buildings, a category encompassing complex buildings with different set-ups and large variability between them. Current energy targets are sometimes considered of limited use by facility professionals in health care {{because they do not}} take account of differences in service delivery between acute hospitals which result in differing use of medical equipment and requirements for <b>room</b> <b>conditioning.</b> For this study, the electricity use of a number of department types has been quantified using on-site measurements. Findings confirm that different hospital departments have hugely varied electricity consumption characteristics. Wards, day clinics and some other departments have lower average consumption intensities which are reasonably well reflected by current hospital electricity benchmarks. Theatres, laboratories and also departments such as imaging and radiotherapy showed much higher consumption intensities exceeding available targets. A revision of current energy benchmarks for the latter category is therefore strongly recommended. It is further proposed to develop composite benchmarks for hospitals taking into account differing energy intensities at a departmental level for guidance and as basis for certification...|$|E
40|$|In Europe, {{hydronic}} {{concrete core}} systems are being increasingly used for <b>room</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems. The concrete slab acts as heat accumulator and permits dissipation {{of the load}} using, for instance, cooling towers. When using such systems the external climatic conditions limit the achievable water temperature. The convective loads, however, directly affect the room air temperature and reduce the storable part of the load. The ventilation system also has a large influence on the energy related operation of such a system. Moreover, {{the dimensions of the}} concrete slab and the layout geometry of the water pipes, especially the spacing, are important factors for the design of the system. A model is described which can be used to illustrate the transient two dimensional heat flow in such a construction. This method is suitable for simple hand calculations, but can also be integrated into existing building simulation programs without having to modify the program code. Thus, the complete system can be designed for practical applications to ensure optimum operation. In addition, this paper describes the interrelationship between heat storage capacity and pipe geometry. Finally, criteria are listed for suitabl...|$|E

However {{at the moment the}} initial investment costs for applying new and more sustainable solutions for a good Indoor Air Quality within buildings are higher than the traditional solutions. As there is often a fixation on primary investment costs, is it very important to stimulate the application of Life Cycle Performance Costing models, to show clients which alternative, on the long run, is the best solution. The Life Cycle Performance Costing tool was developed to assess possible sustainable design solutions. The tool shows the advantages of more sustainable and healthier solutions during their lifecycle and so supports the decision making in favor for the possible application of those solutions. It uses dynamic costing based on discounted cash flows and the use of user scenarios instead of a traditional static approach.

40|$|Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) {{emitted from}} uses such as {{refrigerants}} and thermal insulating foam, {{are now the}} fastest growing greenhouse gases (GHGs), with global warming potentials (GWP) thousands of times higher than carbon dioxide (CO 2). Because of the short lifetime of these molecules in the atmosphere, mitigating the amount of these short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) provides a faster path to climate change mitigation than control of CO 2 alone. This has led to proposals from Africa, Europe, India, Island States, and North America to amend the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal Protocol) to phase-down high-GWP HFCs. Simultaneously, energy efficiency market transformation programs such as standards, labeling and incentive programs are endeavoring to improve the energy efficiency for refrigeration and air conditioning equipment to provide life cycle cost, energy, GHG, and peak load savings. In this paper we provide {{an estimate of the}} magnitude of such GHG and peak electric load savings potential, for <b>room</b> air <b>conditioning,</b> if the refrigerant transition and energy efficiency improvement policies are implemented either separately or in parallel. We find that implementing HFC refrigerant transition and energy efficiency improvement policies in parallel for <b>room</b> air <b>conditioning,</b> roughly doubles the benefit of either policy implemented separately. We estimate that shifting the 2030 world stock of room air conditioners from the low efficiency technology using high-GWP refrigerants to higher efficiency technology and low-GWP refrigerants in parallel would save between 340 - 790 gigawatts (GW) of peak load globally, which is roughly equivalent to avoiding 680 - 1550 peak power plants of 500 MW each. This would save 0. 85 GT/year annually in China equivalent to over 8 Three Gorges dams and over 0. 32 GT/year annually in India equivalent to roughly twice India’s 100 GW solar mission target. While there is some uncertainty associated with emissions and growth projections, moving to efficient <b>room</b> air <b>conditioning</b> (~ 30 % more efficient than current technology) in parallel with low-GWP refrigerants in <b>room</b> air <b>conditioning</b> could avoid up to ~ 25 billion tonnes of CO 2 in 2030, ~ 33 billion in 2040, and ~ 40 billion in 2050, i. e. cumulative savings up to 98 billion tonnes of CO 2 by 2050. Therefore, superefficient room ACs using low-GWP refrigerants merit serious consideration to maximize peak load reduction and GHG savings...|$|R
