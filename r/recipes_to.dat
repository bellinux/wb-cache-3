5|$|Throughout the world, {{different}} seasoning {{and spices}} {{are used to}} augment the flavor of fried chicken. Because of the versatility of fried chicken, {{it is not uncommon}} to flavor the chicken's crisp exterior with a variety of spices ranging from spicy to savory. Depending on regional market ubiquity, local spice variations may be labeled as distinct from traditional Southern U.S. flavors, or may appear on menus without notation. With access to chickens suitable for frying broadening on a global scale with the advent of industrialized poultry farming, many localities have added their own mark on fried chicken, tweaking <b>recipes</b> <b>to</b> suit local preferences.|$|E
5|$|Acton was {{supplanted by}} the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era, Isabella Beeton's Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. Where Acton's was a book to be read and enjoyed, Beeton's, {{substantially}} written in later editions by other hands, was a manual of instructions and <b>recipes,</b> <b>to</b> be looked up as needed. Mrs Beeton was substantially plagiarized from authors including Elizabeth Raffald and Acton. The Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli became a celebrity, cooking {{for a series of}} aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including Queen Victoria. His 1846 book The Modern Cook ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering bills of fare for up to 300 people.|$|E

Other similar competitions are held by local governments (such as Kaohsiung City). In Tainan, indigenous people may sell their food at the Cha Ha Mu Aboriginal Park. Such trends are all to promote the wonderful taste of Aboriginal Taiwanese cuisine.|$|E

She described Ben Fink's photography as [...] "vivid and mouth-watering, if a little spare."

500|$|Though Lawson {{has enjoyed}} a {{successful}} career in cookery, {{she is not a}} trained chef, and does not like being referred to as a [...] "celebrity chef". Furthermore, she does not see herself as a cook or an expert in her field. Throughout Lawson's television programmes, she emphasises that she cooks for her own pleasure, for enjoyment, and that she finds cooking therapeutic. When deciding upon which <b>recipes</b> <b>to</b> feature in her books, she takes the view of the eater, stating, [...] "If it's something I don't want to carry on eating once I'm full, then I don't want the recipe ... I have to feel that I want to cook the thing again".|$|E

500|$|In May 1961 Fleming {{sent his}} {{publisher}} the manuscripts {{for the first}} two volumes of Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang. To illustrate the book, Fleming suggested the Daily Mail cartoonist Trog—the pseudonym of Wally Fawkes—as he admired the artist's work. While undertaking the preliminary drawings for the book, Trog tried to make the fudge recipe included in the book and found it was not particularly good: the editors at Jonathan Cape spent a day making up batches from different <b>recipes</b> <b>to</b> find a better one to use. Although Fawkes completed preliminary drawings for the project, the Daily Mail refused to allow him to complete the work as many of Fleming's works were serialised in its rival, the Daily Express. Other early illustrative sketches were produced by artist Haro Hodson and motor engineer Amherst Villiers. After Trog was forced to withdraw from the project, Cape commissioned John Burningham, who had recently won the 1963 Kate Greenaway Medal for his book [...]|$|E

500|$|Because the {{gameplay}} {{revolves around}} strengthening individual heroes, {{it does not}} require focus on resource management and base-building, unlike most traditional real-time strategy games. Killing computer-controlled or neutral units earns the player experience points; the player gains a level when enough experience is accumulated. Leveling up improves the hero's toughness and the damage they inflict, and allows players to upgrade spells or skills. In addition to accumulating experience, players also manage a single resource of gold. The typical resource-gathering of Warcraft III is replaced by a combat-oriented money system; in addition to a small periodic income, heroes earn gold by killing or destroying hostile units, base structures, and enemy heroes. This has caused emphasis on a technique called [...] "last-hitting," [...] which is when the player attacks a hostile unit when [...] "its hit points are low enough to kill it with one blow". Using gold, players buy items to strengthen their hero and gain abilities; certain items can be combined with <b>recipes</b> <b>to</b> create more powerful items. Buying items that suit one's hero is an important tactical element of the mod.|$|E
500|$|A {{preference}} for British cooking methods {{is apparent in}} cookbooks brought to the New World. [...] There was a general disdain for French cookery, even among the French Huguenots in South Carolina and French Canadians. One cookbook common in the colonies, The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, by Hannah Glasse, held the French style of cookery in disdain, stating [...] "the blind folly of this age that would rather be imposed on by a French booby, than give encouragement to a good English cook!" [...] She does add French <b>recipes</b> <b>to</b> the text but speaks out flagrantly against the dishes, [...] "...think(ing) it an odd jumble of trash." [...] The French and Indian War (1754–1764) reinforced anti-French sentiment. The conflict strengthened an age-old English distrust of the French, and led the English to deport French-speaking people, as in the forced migration of the Acadians to Louisiana. The Acadian French brought a profound French influence to the diet of settlers in Louisiana, but had little influence outside of that region.|$|E
