5|$|As {{the apex}} of the Canadian system of honours, the Victoria Cross is to be worn before all other Canadian decorations and {{insignia}} of orders, including the Order of Merit and the Order of Canada. It is worn as a medal, suspended from a medal bar on the left chest, unless protocol calls for a <b>ribbon</b> bar, which consists of a crimson <b>ribbon</b> with a miniature bronze Victoria Cross at its centre. Should an individual receive multiple awards of the Victoria Cross, additional bronze medal bars are added to the <b>ribbon</b> and further miniatures are placed evenly on the <b>ribbon</b> bar, reflecting the number of crosses the wearer has earned.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe prove {{recognition}} theorems for codimension one manifold {{factors of}} dimension n⩾ 4. In particular, we formalize topographical methods and introduce three <b>ribbons</b> properties: the crinkled <b>ribbons</b> property, the twisted crinkled <b>ribbons</b> property, and the fuzzy <b>ribbons</b> property. We show that X×R is a manifold {{in the cases}} when X is a resolvable generalized manifold of finite dimension n⩾ 3 with either: (1) the crinkled <b>ribbons</b> property; (2) the twisted crinkled <b>ribbons</b> property and the disjoint point disk property; or (3) the fuzzy <b>ribbons</b> property...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} on the {{structural}} and magnetic properties of Ni 0. 2 Mn 3. 2 Ga 0. 6 melt-spun <b>ribbons.</b> The as-spun <b>ribbons</b> were found to exhibit mixed cubic phases that transform to non-cubic structure upon annealing. Additionally, an amorphous phase was found to co-exist in all <b>ribbons.</b> The SEM images show that minor grain formation occurs on the as-spun <b>ribbons.</b> However, the formation of extensive nano-grains was observed on the surfaces of the annealed <b>ribbons.</b> While the as-spun <b>ribbons</b> exhibit predominantly paramagnetic behavior, the <b>ribbons</b> annealed under various thermal conditions were found to be ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of about 380 K. The <b>ribbons</b> annealed at 450 °C for 30 minutes exhibit a large coercive field of about 2500 Oe. The experimental results show that the microstructure and associated magnetic properties of the <b>ribbons</b> can be controlled by annealing techniques. The coercive fields and the shape of the magnetic hysteresis loops vary significantly with annealing conditions. Exchange bias effects have also been observed in the annealed <b>ribbons...</b>|$|R

5|$|For {{mourning}} activities, {{the flag}} can be flown {{in either of}} the following ways. The first method, commonly known as half-staffing, is performed when the flag is hoisted {{to the top of}} the flagpole, then lowered to the pole's one-third position. The other method is to attach a black <b>ribbon</b> to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. The <b>ribbon</b> itself is ten centimetres wide and it is attached to the mast so that the ends of the <b>ribbon</b> reach the bottom of the flag. During a funeral ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers, signatories of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before interment.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a double}} system, that is, {{the sound was}} on a {{different}} piece of film from the picture.... In essence, the sound was captured by a microphone and translated into light waves via a light valve, a thin <b>ribbon</b> of sensitive metal over a tiny slit. The sound reaching this <b>ribbon</b> would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm, focusing the resulting light waves through the slit, {{where it would be}} photographed {{on the side of the}} film, on a strip about a tenth of an inch wide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fe- 6. 5 wt. %Si alloy is one {{excellent}} soft magnetic material. In {{the present}} study, rapid quenching {{was applied to}} fabricate ultra-thin <b>ribbons</b> of Fe- 6. 5 wt. %Si alloy by melt spinning. Continuous <b>ribbons</b> of 20 mm wide, 35 - 45 µm thick were fabricated with optimized experimental parameters. The <b>ribbons</b> exhibited metallic luster appearance, and can be wound without cracks. Microstructure, texture and mechanical properties of the <b>ribbons</b> were investigated. It {{was found that the}} rapidly quenched <b>ribbons</b> had intense { 100 } plane texture, and exhibited some extent of bending capability. Finally the <b>ribbons</b> were cold rolled and the surface smoothness was improved for stacking purpose...|$|R
40|$|Fe- 6. 5 wt. %Si alloy is {{prepared}} {{in the form}} of continuous <b>ribbons</b> with 25 [*]mm in width and 0. 03 [*]mm in thickness by using melt spinning technique. The <b>ribbons</b> are flexible and could be wounded into tapes. DC magnetic properties and core loss behaviors of the <b>ribbons</b> after heat treatment are investigated in this paper. The magnetic properties are compared with <b>ribbons</b> by cold rolling and CVD methods. The melt spinning <b>ribbons</b> exhibit much less core loss in the frequencies more than 10 [*]kHz. The melt spinning <b>ribbons</b> are promising to be used for electric devices used in medium or higher frequencies...|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} the medal is modeled after one used for the Hero of the Soviet Union. Unlike the Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Socialist Labor and the Hero of the Russian Federation titles, there is no {{engraving}} on the reverse of the star. The <b>ribbon</b> also copies the Soviet Hero medal's <b>ribbon,</b> since a flag design was also {{used to make the}} <b>ribbon</b> of that medal. The medal is always worn in full {{on the left side of}} the breast above all other medals and orders. Chapter 4, Article 69 of Law N 288-З states that any awards and titles presented by the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR must be placed after awards from the Republic of Belarus.|$|E

5|$|The law {{requires}} the lowering {{of the flag}} to {{the midpoint of the}} flagpole on the days of mourning or during mourning ceremonies. A black <b>ribbon</b> needs to be placed {{at the top of the}} flag; the length of the <b>ribbon</b> should be equal to the length of the flag. The flying flag has to be raised in its entirety, clean, and unfaded; moreover, the lower part of the flag should be at least 2.5 m off the ground.|$|E
5|$|The other {{national}} symbol that was chosen in the 1995 referendum {{was the national}} emblem. The elements of the emblem include a <b>ribbon</b> in {{the colors of the}} national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. At the base of the <b>ribbon,</b> it says the country's official name in the Belarusian language. The emblem is an allusion to the one used by the Byelorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950. In the Soviet version, a hammer and sickle replaced the map of Belarus and the <b>ribbon</b> was all red. On the left and right ribbons, the Soviet motto Workers of the world, unite! appeared in the Belarusian and Russian languages.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ribbon</b> {{is white}} and bordered in red stripes, similar to the Canadian {{national}} flag; the chest <b>ribbon</b> {{is the same for}} each grade, save for a metallic maple leaf in the centre, the colour of which matches that on the badge of the grade that the wearer was appointed to. For civilian wear, a lapel pin is worn on the jacket, which is designed as a miniature of the medallion.|$|E
50|$|The {{national}} colours {{are used for}} indication of the state property and for decoration during state ceremonials. Furthermore, they {{are used in the}} medal <b>ribbons,</b> and coffin wreath <b>ribbons.</b> During public holidays some people wear {{national colours}} <b>ribbons</b> on commemorative purposes.|$|R
50|$|Personnel may wear up {{to three}} badges above the <b>ribbons</b> or pocket flap, or in a similar {{location}} for uniforms without pockets. Personnel may only wear one combat or special skill badges from either group 1 or group 2 above the <b>ribbons.</b> Soldiers may wear {{up to three}} badges from groups 3 and 4 above the <b>ribbons.</b> One badge from either group 1 or group 2 may be worn with badges from groups 3 and 4 above the <b>ribbons</b> {{so long as the}} total number of badges above the <b>ribbons</b> does not exceed three.|$|R

5|$|Wear of the {{insignia}} is {{according to}} guidelines {{issued by the}} Chancellery of Honours, which stipulate that the badges be worn before most other national orders—that is, {{at the end of}} an individual's medal bar closest to the centre of the chest or at the wearer's neck—with only the Victoria Cross, the Cross of Valour, and the badge of the Order of Merit permitted to be worn before the badges of the Order of Canada. Those in the grades of Companion or Officer may wear their badges on a neck <b>ribbon,</b> while those in the Member group display their insignia suspended by a <b>ribbon</b> from a medal bar on the left chest. Protocol originally followed the British tradition, wherein female appointees wore their Order of Canada emblem on a <b>ribbon</b> bow positioned on the left shoulder. These regulations were altered in 1997, and women may wear their insignia in either the traditional manner or in the same fashion as the men.|$|E
