5000|$|Before modern {{electronic}} telephone switching systems came into use, <b>dial</b> <b>tones</b> were usually generated by electromechanical means. In the United States, the standard [...] "city" [...] <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> was a 600 Hz tone that was amplitude-modulated at 120 Hz. Some <b>dial</b> <b>tones</b> were simply adapted from 60 Hz AC line current. In the UK, the standard Post Office <b>dialling</b> <b>tone</b> was 33 Hz; it was {{generated by a}} motor-driven ringing machine in most exchanges, and by a vibrating-reed generator in the smaller ones. Some later ringing machines also generated a 50 Hz <b>dial</b> <b>tone.</b>|$|R

Then establish the connection as usual by dialing 1, the area code, and the phone number to complete the call.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dial</b> <b>Tone</b> is briefly {{mentioned}} in the fiction novel 6 Sick Hipsters. In the story, the character Paul Achting spent four years collecting G.I. Joe figures {{to set up a}} battle scene between the Joes and Cobra. Although <b>Dial</b> <b>Tone's</b> figure is not depicted, as Paul imagined the characters in his head he described Sgt. Slaughter [...] "speaking on a transistor radio to <b>Dial</b> <b>Tone,</b> the communications specialist, back at G.I. Joe headquarters".|$|R
50|$|A {{secondary}} <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> is a <b>dial</b> tone-like sound {{presented to}} the caller after a call {{has been set up}} to prompt for additional digits to be <b>dialed.</b> Secondary <b>dial</b> <b>tones</b> are often used in call queuing and call forwarding systems.|$|R
50|$|A dry loop is an unconditioned leased pair of {{telephone}} {{line from a}} telephone company. The pair does not provide <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> or battery (continuous electric potential), {{as opposed to a}} wet pair, a line usually without <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> but with battery.|$|R
50|$|The class 5 {{office is}} the local {{exchange}} or end office. It delivers <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> to the customer.

50|$|Invented by {{engineer}} August Kruckow, the <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> {{was first}} used in 1908 in Hildesheim, Germany. In the United States, the <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> {{was introduced in the}} 1940s, and became widespread in the 1950s. When President Dwight D. Eisenhower retired in 1961 it was nearly universal, but the president himself had not been confronted with a <b>dial</b> <b>tone.</b> When he picked up his own household phone his assistant had to explain what the strange noise was, as well as show Eisenhower how to use a rotary dial phone.|$|R

50|$|Notice, {{that when}} using older non-digital {{extensions}} for the inter-city, international calls {{as well as}} the calls made to the national mobile and sip-numbers, {{it may be necessary to}} wait for a continuous <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> after the first 0. This applies to the old-style rotary phones (as opposed to modern digital dial phones). For example, to call a Chernihiv local landline number from Kiev, one needs to dial 0, wait for a <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> and then <b>dial</b> 46 (Chernivtsi regional code) and then dial the local number in that city. Similarly, when calling Vancouver, Canada, one needs to dial 0, wait for the <b>dial</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>dial</b> another 0 to access international line, then dial 1 (for Canada and the USA), followed by 778 (one of the area codes for British Columbia), followed by the 7-digit local number.|$|R

50|$|The modern <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> varies between countries.

These two tones are also used as a <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> in the UK, but most of Europe uses a constant single tone of 425 Hz.|$|R

40|$|For Telephone, Satz focusses on the {{familiar}} {{pitch of the}} electronic <b>dial</b> <b>tone,</b> a signal of live telephonic connection which came into widespread use in 1950 s. Considering the <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> as an open field of potential communication, Satz talked with electronic music pioneers Laurie Spiegel and Pauline Oliveros on the technological and perceptual implications of composing and listening to sustained musical notes, known as drone music. Excerpts of the conversations, recorded via Skype and IPhone, are played against compositions by the two composers, probing the political, musical and conceptual implications of the drone. <b>Dial</b> <b>Tone</b> Drone features excerpts from ‘Horse Sings From Cloud’ (1975), an accordion score by Pauline Oliveros, and ‘Expanding Universe’ (1974 - 76), a computerised composition by Laurie Spiegel. The commission is a companion piece to Satz’s work <b>Dial</b> <b>Tone</b> Operator, on show as part of ‘Mirrorcity’ at Hayward Gallery. To coincide with {{the launch of the}} commission there was a live performance with Elaine Mitchener and Jennifer Walshe at the Hayward Gallery on the 15 th November 2015.

50|$|In the 1970's {{and early}} 1980's, 1199011 was {{a number that}} when called {{would result in a}}nother <b>dial</b> <b>tone.</b> Afterwards, if the phone was hung up and then quickly picked up again in less than {{approximately}} 1/2 second, a steady tone would then be heard (different then a regular <b>dial</b> <b>tone).</b> Hanging up the phone after this would result in a ring back. When the ring back was answered, the ring back process could be repeated by hanging up and lifting up the phone quickly again, and then hanging up.|$|R
5000|$|ToneLoc took {{advantage}} of the extended return codes available on US Robotics modems (e.g., ATX6 [...] ) to detect <b>dial</b> <b>tones</b> upon <b>dialing</b> a number and to detect when a human answered the phone in addition to scanning for other modems. Detection of voice numbers sped up the scanning process by disconnecting upon detecting a human instead of timing out waiting for a modem carrier signal. The detection of a <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> after <b>dialing</b> a number allowed for users to search for poorly secured extenders which could be used to divert calls through.|$|R
