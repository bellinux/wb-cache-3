5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} {{seen in the}} woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a clouded yellow or Camberwell beauty may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies {{can be found in the}} dunes, where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, southern hawker and <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} water birds {{can be seen}} around the lake including: great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocoracidae), mute swan (Cygnus olor), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), duck (Anatidae), shoveller (Anas clypeata) and gadwall (Anas strepera). The common buzzard (Buteo buteo) {{can be seen on}} the surrounding hills and both Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and kestrel breed. Occasional visitors include: osprey ("Pandion haeliatis"), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), nuthatch and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). The <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> dragonfly (Sympetrum sanguineum) can also be seen. In the wood at the western end of the lake there are populations of badgers, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and foxes.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic midges (Chironomidae) {{provide the}} highest {{proportion}} of the fly life of the lake. The trout (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including daphnia and snails are {{also found in the}} lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) and significant numbers of <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum sanguineum), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (Archanara dissoluta), twin-spotted wainscot (Archanara geminipuncta) and silky wainscot (Chilodes maritimus).|$|E
50|$|Thousands of anthills of {{the yellow}} meadow ant {{can be found in}} the ancient grasslands of Old Hall Marshes as well as around twenty-four species of butterfly. Dragonflies are also popular in this area which include the scarce emerald {{damselfly}} and good numbers of <b>ruddy</b> <b>darters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sightings of a {{range of}} bird and land life have been noted here. The fauna {{includes}} kingfishers, brown hare, grass snakes , bitterns, <b>ruddy</b> <b>darters,</b> and the great crested grebe. Plant life includes common twayblade, common spotted orchid, spindle, small leaved lime, woodruff, greater stitchwort, sanicle, and the early purple orchid.|$|R
25|$|Dragonflies and damselflies are common, with 15 species recorded, {{two-thirds of}} which are known to breed here. Species include the broad-bodied chaser (Libellula depressa), common hawker (Aeshna juncea), emperor (Anax imperator) and <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum sanguineum), {{as well as the}} first Cheshire {{sighting}} of the migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta).|$|E
50|$|The <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum sanguineum) is a European {{species of}} {{dragonfly}} {{of the family}} Libellulidae.|$|E
50|$|The all-black {{legs of the}} <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> {{distinguish}} it from the otherwise very similar common darter (Sympetrum striolatum) and vagrant darter (Sympetrum vulgatum), both of which show yellow stripes on their legs.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} areas of native {{woodland}} which support {{a wide variety}} of birds. Several small ponds have frogs, newts and the <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> dragonfly. More open areas have a good variety of insects including the small copper butterfly and Roesel's bush-cricket.|$|E
50|$|Newtown Green {{consists}} of open areas of green space for informal recreation and organised sports. Mature trees form {{the perimeter of}} the site and the Aylesford Stream runs along the edge. <b>Ruddy</b> <b>darter,</b> banded demoiselle, blue-tailed damselfly and common blue damselfly have been recorded at the site.|$|E

50|$|The Exminster Marshes, {{a series}} of fields drained by dykes and ditches, carry several plants rare in Devon {{including}} parsley, water dropwort (Oenanthe lachenalii), flowering rush Butomus umbellatus and frogbit Hydrocharis morsus-ranae. Dragonflies are also supported, such as the <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum sanguineum) and hairy dragonfly (Brachytron pratense).|$|E
50|$|The <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> attains a {{wingspan}} {{of up to}} 6 cm. The head, thorax and abdomen of {{the male}} are vivid red, while the female is slightly smaller, and is a golden-yellow colour with black markings. The abdomen widens for the final third of its length and shows a marked pinched section where it joins the thorax.|$|E
50|$|Amongst the {{dragonfly}} fauna of {{the site}} are the fenland hairy dragonfly (Brachytron pratense), the black-tailed skimmer (Orthetrum cancellatum), the <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> (Symtetrum sanguineum), and the migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta). The site also hosts a diversity of beetle and fly species, and the profile of invertebrates found at the ponds {{is found to be}} related to ponds of south and south-east England.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> is to {{be found}} in {{temperate}} regions throughout Europe as far east as Siberia and as far south as the northern Sahara. Its conservation status is regarded as secure, and indeed numbers seem to be increasing in some locations such as central England. It tends to prefer quiet bodies of water that feature semiaquatic vegetation such as rushes and reeds.|$|E
50|$|Twywell Gullet is {{a former}} {{ironstone}} quarry which has deep cuttings with steeply sloping banks. It has species-rich limestone grassland on the slopes and ponds and scrub in the bottoms. There {{are a number of}} uncommon ground nesting bees and wasps, and beetles include the nationally rare <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter.</b> There is a large pond which has a large reedbed and many great crested newts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> can {{be found}} between the months of July and November. Mating takes place on the wing, with the coupled pair {{performing}} a dipping flight over the water. The female jettisons her fertilised eggs at the water surface by alternating movements of the abdomen. The male will hover nearby during this period and protect the female by driving off any approaching males.|$|E
50|$|Some {{insects and}} {{dragonfly}} {{to be seen}} on the river include banded demoiselle, emerald damselfly, scarce emerald damselfly, large red damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, small red-eyed damselfly, azure damselfly, common blue damselfly, blue-tailed damselfly, migrant hawker, southern hawker, brown hawker, emperor dragonfly, four-spotted chaser, broad-bodied chaser, black-tailed skimmer, keeled skimmer, common darter, <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter,</b> common hawker, Norfolk hawker, hairy dragonfly, red-veined darter, yellow-winged darter, black darter and the variable damselfly.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} gravel {{workings}} {{which are now}} disused and filled with water, {{as well as the}} river. Thirteen species of dragonfly and damselfly have been recorded, including one which is rare in Britain, the <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> dragonfly, and two which are locally uncommon, the four-spotted chaser dragonfly and the red-eyed damselfly. Aquatic plants include the yellow water-lily and mare's tail. Rabbits graze acidic grassland, and there are also areas of woodland, scrub herb and fen.|$|E
50|$|As may be {{expected}} for such abundant flora, {{there is also a}} rich and diverse insect and reptile fauna present on the site. Typical meadow butterflies include for meadow brown (Maniola jurtina), common blue (Polyommatus icarus), small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), and the marsh fritillary (Eurodryas aurinia). Bordering hedges support gatekeeper (Pyronia tithonus), ringlet (Aphantopus hyperantus), and speckled wood (Pararge aegeria) butterflies. There are also 14 species of dragonfly recorded including the brown hawker (Aeshna grandis), black-tailer skimmer (Orthetrum cancellatum) and the <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum sanguineum). The common frog is also prevalent.|$|E
50|$|Males {{frequently}} {{bask in the}} sun, on open ground. The flight {{action is}} rather skittish resembling the <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum sanguineum). Males are not territorial, but actively seek out females. This species is the smallest of Britain’s dragonflies. Although not as colourful as some other dragonflies it is a lovely dragonfly to watch. They often perch on a sunny spot on the ground. Their flight is a little skittish, and often flies away as you approach, but sometimes {{it is in a}} 'friendly mood' and lets you get very close. Sometimes they may even land on an observer’s hand.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} water birds {{can be seen}} around the lake including: great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocoracidae), mute swan (Cygnus olor), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), duck (Anatidae), shoveller (Anas clypeata) and gadwall (Anas strepera).

50|$|The {{site has}} good {{views of the}} North Downs in one {{direction}} and the town of Ashford in the other as well as Boys Hall, the house that gives the site its name. The site is characterised by oak and hazel as well as other mature tree species. A variety of dragonflies and damselflies have been seen at the site including emperor dragonfly, <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> and blue-tailed damselfly. There is a pedestrian bridge over High Speed 1, linking this site with Boys Hall Moat. Adjacent to the bridge is an area of reedbed. On the Church Road side of Boys Hall, the site is more formal with mature trees such as turkey oak, providing a pleasant buffer zone between housing and the Southern Orbital road.|$|E
50|$|Brown hares and European otters {{are found}} {{all along the}} north Norfolk coast, but red {{squirrels}} disappeared from the Holkham pines by 1981. The rare natterjack toad breeds at Holkham, {{one of only two}} sites along this coast, although the common frog, common toad and common lizard are widespread in appropriate habitats.The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and ghost moth are sometimes seen in the woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a clouded yellow or Camberwell beauty may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies {{can be found in the}} dunes, where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, southern hawker and <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Priddy Pools {{supports}} {{a very rich}} fauna. Fifteen species of dragonfly have been recorded; as well as supporting the only population of downy emerald in the Mendips, the site hosts the notable four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata) and <b>ruddy</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum sanguineum). Five British species of amphibian occur and there are good populations of great crested newt (Triturus cristatus), smooth newt (Triturus vulgaris) and palmate newt (Triturus helveticus). Three species of reptile, viviparous lizard (Lacerta vivipara), adder (Vipera berus), grass snake (Natrix natrix), {{and at least two}} species of fish; European perch, (Perca fluviatilis) and three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are present. Breeding birds include moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), coot (Fulica atra), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus). Priddy Pools is an important research site. Detailed study of the algae in the northern pool was carried out in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as part of the International Biological Programme.|$|E
