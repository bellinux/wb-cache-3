5000|$|Human geography, though coming {{late to the}} theorizing table, has tackled {{violence}} {{through many}} lenses, including anarchist geography, feminist geography, Marxist geography, political geography, and critical geography.

Cavarero proposes that, in facing such a truth, it is prudent to reconsider violence as [...] "horrorism"; that is, [...] "as though ideally all the…victims, instead of their killers, ought to determine the name".

50|$|In {{keeping with}} an ongoing trend among Hot AC radio {{stations}} across the United States, WBTI has dropped most 1980s and 1990s music from rotation and transitioned to an Adult Top 40 sound, <b>reimaging</b> from The Best of the '80s, '90s and Today to Today's Hit Music. This {{is a return}} to the station's roots, as it featured such a format throughout the 1990s and until 2002. The change helps differentiate the station more distinctly from rival mainstream AC stations WGRT, CFGX-FM and WTGV-FM. WBTI still plays '90s music on Sunday mornings. In the late hours at night, WBTI has been known to occasionally play some 90s rock and alternative hits that would typically be heard on sister station Rock 105.5. Examples would be Green Day, Eve 6, Kid Rock, and even Candlebox.|$|E

USF has moved the station slightly closer to the Tampa Bay area; WSMR's coverage is primarily the Sarasota-Bradenton area. However, the station's programming is also heard on WUSF-HD2. WUSF's main frequency began broadcasting an NPR News and talk schedule on September 15, 2010; however, WSMR failed to launch on that date as previously announced.

50|$|The IMS overcomes this {{limitation}} by acquiring spatial and spectral information simultaneously {{within a single}} integration event. The parallel acquisition is achieved by utilizing a custom-fabricated component - termed image mapper - as a field remapping unit in the IMS. The image mapper consists of hundreds of mirror facets, the size of which is around 70 micrometres. Each mirror facet has a two-dimensional tilt angles, reflecting light towards x direction and y direction. The image mapper cut the field into strips and create blank regions between adjacent image strips on the CCD camera due to the tilt angle difference of mirror facs. The image strips are then dispersed into these created blanked regions by an array and prisms and <b>reimaging</b> lenses. In this way, each pixel on the CCD camera is encoded with unique spatial and spectral information of the sample. By implementing a simple image remapping algorithm, a (x, y, lambda) datacube is measured.|$|E

5000|$|From 1967 to 1970 {{and again}} since 1977, KSWO-TV has used {{some form of}} the Circle 7 logo used by many ABC owned-and-operated and {{affiliated}} stations that broadcast on channel 7. It is the longest-continuously used logo among the television stations in the Wichita Falls-Lawton market, having been used continuously since 1979 - although the version first used in its second tenure of use for two years prior was similar in resemblance that used in the 1980s and 1990s by CBS affiliate KOSA-TV in Odessa. The station switched back to the proprietary version of the [...] "Circle 7" [...] initially designed by G. Dean Smith for ABC's owned-and-operated stations in 1979, {{as part of a}} <b>reimaging</b> that included the introduction of a new set as well as the Action 7 News brand for its newscasts. The current incarnation of the logo (introduced in 2005), which uses a red background instead of the blue standard for the proprietary ABC version of the logo, is similar in resemblance to the version used by Sunbeam Television stations WHDH in Boston and WSVN in Miami. Drewry sold KSWO radio, as well as KRHD (1350 AM, now KPNS) and KRHD-FM (102.3 FM, now KKEN at 97.1 FM) in Duncan, to Anadarko-based Monroe-Stephens Broadcasting in 1998, in order to focus its business around KSWO-TV and its sister television stations.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, {{security}} appliances {{have been}} viewed as high performance products that may have had custom ASIC chips in it that allow for higher performance levels due to its dedicated hardware approach. Many vendors have started to call pre-built operating systems with dedicated applications on dedicated server hardware {{from the likes of}} IBM, Dell and offshore brands “appliances”. The appliance terminology although heavily used now has strayed from its original roots. An administrator would expect to see any underpinning Linux OS employ a monolithic kernel since the hardware platform is presumably static and vendor-controlled. However, the following examples are configured to use loadable kernel modules, reflecting the dynamic nature of the underlying hardware platforms used by product managers. [...] "Appliances" [...] have varying degrees of administrative openness. Enterasys Dragon version 7 IPS sensors (GE250 and GE500) are lightly hardened version of a Slackware Linux distribution, complete with administrative vulnerabilities, and shipping with anonymous root access the preferred method of administration of the underlying OS. Motorola AirDefense management consoles are shipped as an [...] "appliance" [...] without supported root access. Administrative setup tasks are performed via a textual menus running as an unprivileged user. Websense DSS sensor devices use CentOS 5.2 underneath and also allow root access at setup time. McAfee's older e-Policy Orchestator distributions use a RedHat 7 -based distribution, but modifications to typical OS configuration files are reset on reboot. Most of these devices primary configuration are via web interfaces. The implication that patches are not required for appliances is less accurate than the implication that vendors will be less apt to provide swift modular patches without complete <b>reimaging</b> of the devices. Companies such as NetScreen Technologies and TippingPoint defined security appliances by having dedicated hardware with custom ASIC chips in them to deliver high performing Firewall and Intrusion Prevention technology respectively. These companies defined there specific markets in the early 2000-2004 time frame.|$|E

40|$|Long {{frustrated}} by negative portrayals of their {{cities in the}} media and public sphere, local stakeholders in Detroit, USA and Newcastle, Australia have undertaken various efforts designed to reshape the image of these transitioning post-industrial cities. This thesis explores the current state of promotional <b>reimaging</b> practices in the two cities through detailed case studies, with a focus on efforts by individuals and organizations outside of government. While entrepreneurial <b>reimaging</b> strategies have been a feature of post-industrial urban governance for decades, much of the related academic research has focused on top-down urban branding campaigns coordinated by local officials. This urban branding literature provides only a partial explanation for the <b>reimaging</b> practices now occurring in Detroit and Newcastle, where government-led rebranding has been limited for financial and political reasons. This thesis complements the existing literature by exploring the <b>reimaging</b> role being played by unofficial participants like entrepreneurs, artists, bloggers and DIY urbanists. To develop a broader perspective on how <b>reimaging</b> is occurring in these cities the thesis looks beyond the existing urban branding literature to consider other strands of relevant urban theory, from everyday urbanism to place theory to network analysis. Building on this wide-ranging theoretical foundation, the case studies draw on in-depth interviews to provide a detailed examination of <b>reimaging</b> efforts in Detroit and Newcastle. In particular, the case studies explore who is engaged in trying to reshape the image of these cities, what motivates them to become involved, and what tools they are employing to achieve these goals. The cases also explore the narratives being promoted by participants, and how these reflect different possible futures for the two cities. In these ways the cases identify important connections between contemporary <b>reimaging</b> practices and other current urban trends including DIY urbanism, place-making and social media use. The research also sheds light on the layered nature of <b>reimaging</b> practices and how they reflect ongoing urban debates over gentrification, social justice and democracy versus privatization. It provides a new perspective on the complex dynamics of cities in transition, highlighting the need for a broader understanding of the role of <b>reimaging</b> efforts in reshaping these places...|$|E

40|$|The {{contemporary}} city is notably image-conscious. Indeed, several commentators {{suggest that}} cities are consciously attempting to manufacture images and identities by manipulating {{a range of}} myths, traditions, lifestyles and urban cultures. The need to develop appealing city images is a particular concern for post-industrial cities attempting to acquire attractive reputations as tourist destinations. In an almost desperate search for imaging themes for this purpose, {{a growing number of}} cities have employed sport initiatives, involving events, event bids and the construction of new facilities. Despite the lack of evidence of, and associated explanations for, image effects, it is widely assumed that these initiatives do have the capacity to enhance the image of the city destination. The present study explores the validity of this assumption by evaluating the use and impacts of `sport reimaging' in three UK cities - Birmingham, Manchester and Sheffield. Despite recognition of the multiple objectives of city <b>reimaging</b> in these cities, the primary aim of the study is to reveal how sport initiatives have influenced the images of potential tourists. Findings included in the study affirm that all three of the case-study cities have used sport events and sport stadia as vehicles for <b>reimaging,</b> with tourist images a particular concern. The study not only assesses whether such <b>reimaging</b> works, but explores how it might work. The study is assisted by the development and use of a conceptual framework that surmises that sport <b>reimaging</b> can influence both the holistic images of cities and specific perceptions of sporting provision. The study employs this framework to evaluate the impacts of sport imaging by identifying the processes through which these impacts may be procured. Accordingly, the effects of the case study initiatives are assessed in reference to their propensity to engender denotative perceptions of impressive sport provision and their capacity to procure fresh metonymic images and positive connotations. This is achieved by using a combination of methods, including semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, to explore how sport <b>reimaging</b> has affected the images of potential tourists. As such the study addresses a weakness in the burgeoning place image literature which is dominated by attempts to deconstruct city <b>reimaging,</b> and where there is too little attention to its reception, consumption and interpretation by target audiences. The study findings suggest that all three case study cities have developed strong sporting reputations and that sport initiatives do have the capacity to affect holistic city images because of their potency as metonyms and metaphors. However, despite widespread awareness of their implementation, the specific effects engendered by some case study initiatives appear rather limited. Furthermore, the study reveals certain problems. </p...|$|E
