30|$|In Spain, pay {{guidelines}} {{based on}} inflation forecasts in the cross-sectoral agreements since 2002 {{in combination with}} the wage <b>revision</b> <b>clauses</b> in sectoral agreements which adjust wages to observed inflation operate as a form of ‘soft’ or ‘non-automatic’ indexation. In Italy, the cross-sector agreement of 2009 has adopted {{more or less the same}} model, whereas previously, based on the triparite reform pact of 1993, past inflation had been the basis for wage adjustments in sectoral agreements. In Spain, meanwhile, there has been a sharp decline in the use of <b>revision</b> <b>clauses.</b> With no cross-industry agreement signed in 2009, the new biennial central framework agreements reached in 2010 and 2012 no longer incorporate official inflation forecasts. Probably reflecting this, the proportion of employees covered by collective agreements with wage <b>revision</b> <b>clauses</b> fell from two-thirds in 2007, prior to the crisis, to an estimated one-third in 2012.|$|R

40|$|Most LNG is {{sold under}} confidential, {{bilateral}} long-term contracts, particularly in Asia. Thus, though prices {{are thought to}} be indexed to crude oil, actual prices, contract terms and price <b>revision</b> <b>clauses</b> are not known. Therefore, I use customs data and techniques for detecting multiple unknown structural breaks in cointegrated regressions to characterize empirical pricing relationships and make inferences about pricing terms for 16 Japanese, South Korean, Taiwanese and Spanish LNG price series. LNG does appear to be indexed to oil, but terms appear considerably more complex and varied than rules of thumb. I find evidence for S-curve behavior, multiple revisions and variation in both the degree of indexation and the specification of oil benchmarks. Japanese terms are revised most. Terms for the other importers appear more stable, and indexation is weakest in Spain. This paper complements existing work on gas market integration, which largely ignores the data-generating process for LNG prices...|$|R
40|$|Background to the submission. During {{the first}} part of 2006, I was {{appointed}} Visiting Professor at the University of Melbourne in order to carry out research funded by the UK property industry into the lease legislation in Australia with the objective of determining whether any of the Australian approach to commercial leases could inform the current ongoing debate in the UK. This debate commenced with a UK Government consultation paper in 1992 which threatened to legislate to ban upwards only rent <b>revision</b> <b>clauses,</b> confidentiality agreements forbidding tenants to reveal details of lease transactions and to improve the dispute resolution process, especially at lease renewal. Since then, the agenda has changed but lease reform has been {{near the top of the}} UK Government real estate and planning policy agenda. The UK property industry has so far persuaded the UK Government not to legislate and to sponsor and encourage voluntary industry Codes of Practice. The role of the University in this debate has been as the Government research contractor charged with monitoring the operation of the Codes of Practice. My role has been to act as lead researcher. There have been three codes, the first was introduced in 1995 and th...|$|R

40|$|The {{time charter}} plays a very {{significant}} role in the practical shipping field. However, the time charterparty itself has attracted little consideration by researchers working in the field. In addition, there are still many legal issues that require resolution as it is possible to easily confuse merchants, leading to further practical disputes. This thesis explores the core characteristics of the time charter. It discusses crucial legal issues and aims to resolve potential legal disputes. It also considers key improvements to the relevant significant clauses in the current essential standard forms of the time charterparty by way of recommending <b>revisions</b> to <b>clauses</b> within various charterparties such as the BALTIME form, the NYPE 46 form, the NYPE 93 form and the GENTIME form. The original contribution of this thesis is not only the modification of vital clauses in these essential forms for merchants, but also the provision of constructive ways of reforming the remaining clauses in these forms thereby providing a potential guiding framework for the revision of other standard charterparty forms in the future. ...|$|R

These techniques were combined in an algorithm which focused {{in on the}} parts of a theory which involve ordinal sorts, and applied geometrical revision operators to repair faulty component parts. While we illustrate the feasibility of applying ML to this area, we conclude that to be effective it must be focused to the application at hand, and used in mixed-initiative mode within a tools environment.

40|$|Fifteen {{years after}} the <b>revision</b> of <b>Clause</b> IV and over a decade since Labour came to office, the centre-Left needs to revisit {{fundamental}} questions about what it stands for {{and the sort of}} society it seeks. The twin crisis of the credit crunch and MPs’ expenses – combined with the forthcoming general election – only make this task more urgent. This collection of essays testifies to the vitality of thinking across the modern Left. It shows that its traditions and values are both rich and relevant to today’s problems. The essays confront the central ideological tensions facing the centre-Left, such as its attitude to equality, political economy, community and identity, and power and democracy. By drawing on a range of perspectives, this collection demonstrates how openness and pluralism can be combined with the confidence that there is much that unites the British centre-Left {{as we move into the}} second decade of the new century. Amid the complexity and diversity of the ideas expressed throughout the collection, a simple goal emerges: powerful people in a reciprocal society. This goal embodies the best of Labour’s traditions and can provide a fertile ground for policy, organisation, governance and the long-term political future of the Left.

The objective of the research was to determine the effectiveness of the Joint Building Contracts Committee Series 2000 Principal Building Agreement (JBCC 2000 PBA) (Edition 4. 1, March 2005) currently used in the Building Industry. The literature reviewed and results of quantitative research amongst contractors formed the basis of this study. The study revealed that the JBCC 2000 PBA is the most favourable contract document used by contractors in the Building Industry. With the inclusion of a range of construction guarantee alternatives in the contract document in lieu of the retention clause, {{more than half of the}} respondents have indicated that they are in favour of a retention clause to be included in the contract document as an alternative security option. The study also showed that there are still areas of concern with regards to the difficulty in interpreting and implementing numerous clauses of the document and that amendments were made to the document without legal advice, resulting in disputes. The research further also revealed that developing building contractors experience difficulties in general where the JBCC 2000 PBA is used as contract document on projects. There also seems to be no balance of risk between the employer and contractor in most cases where this contract document is used. The research concluded with proposals on <b>revisions</b> to some <b>clauses</b> to ensure a better contract document that will be acceptable to all contractors in the Building Industry and ultimately to be an internationally acceptable documen...|$|R
40|$|Public Notary {{is needed}} in {{conducting}} businesses of varying sectors. For example, {{people who want to}} own a house through a bank with House Ownership Loan (Kredit Pemilikan Rumah - KPR). Quite similar to a purchase of common loan contracts, the purchase of KPR contract is formulated into a standard contract. Its contents and clauses have been previously prepared by the bank. Then, bank customers as debtors only have the option to accept the entire contents and clauses of the KPR contract, otherwise they will not be granted KPR loan. As the consequence, the position of banks as lenders and customers as debtors are never equal. Debtors are powerless and have to comply with the content of the contract. This research discusses the protection given by notary in the drafting process of standard contract based on Law No 8 of 1999 on Consumer Protection (Undang-Undang Perlindungan Konsumen - UUPK) and Law No. 2 of 2014 on the Rules of Notary Profession (Undang-Undang Jabatan Notaris - UUJN). The result of the study showed that a public notary has a strong foundation to protect consumers’ rights according to the UUPK. An application of this, among others, the notary’s refusal has to include the entire content of the KPR agreement into a deed before s/he could examine whether the two parties of the agreement occupy an equal position and have proportionate power. For instance, in the transfer of responsibility clause from a bank as a business owner – a notary is entitled to advise the bank that its activity has violated the UUPK. If the bank insists that the clause is instructed by its central bank, the notary can help explain that the <b>revision</b> of the <b>clause</b> will help the Bank avoid the violation of UUPK...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to analize of policy implementation for Integrated Antenatal Careservices at Sananwetan, Kepanjen kidul, and Sukorejo Public Health Centers. Methods: A qualitative study with purposivedesign. Method for policy analysis used “a health policy triangle framework” (Walt & Gilson, 1994). Results: Lack of therole of policy actors in fi elds to bridge among integrated antenatal care services program, midwives, lab analyst andprovider. Integrated Antenatal care Services are concerned with physical examinations conducted by Midwives and areconcerned with laboratorium test both routine and medical indications conducted by laboratory analyst. Lack of technicaltraining for midwives and lab analyst. Conclusion: Inter Sectoral partnership for policy actors in implementing integratedantenatal care of Health Centers were lack and ranning partially. Lack of availability of laboratory facilities and USG toexam pregnant womens.
