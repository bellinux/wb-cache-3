50|$|Since CASA {{serves to}} model {{functionality}} {{parts of the}} auditory system, {{it is necessary to}} view parts of the biological auditory system in terms of known physical models. Consisting of three areas, the outer, middle and inner ear, the auditory periphery acts as a complex transducer that converts sound vibrations into action potentials in the auditory nerve. The outer ear consists of the external ear, ear canal and the ear drum. The outer ear, like an acoustic funnel, helps locating the sound source. The ear canal acts as a resonant tube (like an organ pipe) to amplify frequencies between 2-5.5 kHz with a maximum amplification of about 11dB occurring around 4 kHz. As the organ of hearing, the cochlea consists of two membranes, Reissner’s and the basilar membrane. The basilar membrane moves to audio stimuli through the specific stimulus frequency matches the resonant frequency of a particular region of the basilar membrane. The movement the basilar membrane displaces the inner hair cells in one direction, which encodes a half-wave <b>rectified</b> <b>signal</b> of action potentials in the spiral ganglion cells. The axons of these cells make up the auditory nerve, encoding the rectified stimulus. The auditory nerve responses select certain frequencies, similar to the basilar membrane. For lower frequencies, the fibers exhibit “phase locking”. Neurons in higher auditory pathway centers are tuned to specific stimuli features, such as periodicity, sound intensity, amplitude and frequency modulation. There are also neuroanatomical associations of ASA through the posterior cortical areas, including the posterior superior temporal lobes and the posterior cingulate. Studies have found that impairments in ASA and segregation and grouping operations are affected in patients with Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

The <b>rectified</b> <b>signal</b> from Nb ($Tc= 9. 15 $ K) has been measured {{by means of an}} inductive method as a function of temperature, dc field, dc field sweep rate, and the amplitude of ac field. The Nb sample was excited by an amplitude modulated ac field. Under a stationary regime, the <b>rectified</b> <b>signal</b> appears only for magnetic fields ($H_ 0 $) in the range $H_{c 2 }H_{c 1 }$.

40|$|Rectification of EMG signals is {{a common}} {{processing}} step used when performing electroencephalographic–electromyographic (EEG–EMG) coherence and EMG–EMG coherence. It is well known, however, that EMG rectification alters the power spectrum of the recorded EMG signal (interference EMG). The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether rectification of the EMG signal influences the capability of capturing the oscillatory input to a single EMG signal and the common oscillations between two EMG signals. Several EMG signals were reconstructed from experimentally recorded EMG signals from the surface of the first dorsal interosseus muscle and were manipulated to have an oscillatory input or common input (for pairs of reconstructed EMG signals) at various frequency bands (in Hz: 0 – 12, 12 – 30, 30 – 50, 50 – 100, 100 – 150, 150 – 200, 200 – 250, 250 – 300, and 300 – 400), one at a time. The absolute integral and normalized integral of power, peak power, and peak coherence (for pairs of EMG signals) were quantified from each frequency band. The power spectrum of the interference EMG accurately detected the changes to the oscillatory input to the reconstructed EMG signal, whereas the power spectrum of the rectified EMG did not. Similarly, the EMG–EMG coherence between two interference EMG signals accurately detected the common input to the pairs of reconstructed EMG signals, whereas the EMG–EMG coherence between two <b>rectified</b> EMG <b>signals</b> did not. The frequency band from 12 to 30 Hz in the power spectrum of the rectified EMG and the EMG–EMG coherence between two <b>rectified</b> <b>signals</b> was influenced by the input from 100 to 150 Hz but not from the input from 12 to 30 Hz. The study concludes that the power spectrum of the EMG and EMG–EMG coherence should be performed on interference EMG signals and not on <b>rectified</b> EMG <b>signals</b> because rectification impairs the identification of the oscillatory input to a single EMG signal and the common oscillatory input between two EMG signals...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for on-line nonlinear filtering based on wavelet thresholding. Online multiscale (OLMS) rectification applies wavelet thresholding to {{data in a}} moving window of dyadic length to remove random errors. Gross errors are removed by combining wavelet thresholding with multiscale median filtering. Theoretical analysis shows that OLMS rectification using Haar wavelets subsumes mean filters of dyadic length, while rectification with smoother boundary corrected wavelets is analogous to adaptive exponential smoothing. If the rectified measurements are not needed on-line, the quality of rectification can be further improved by averaging the <b>rectified</b> <b>signals</b> in each window. The resulting approach overcomes the boundary effects encountered in translation invariant (TI) rectification of Coifman and Donoho (1995), and is called boundary corrected translation invariant (BCTI) rectification.

30|$|For {{detecting}} EPI {{events from}} the Swarm electron density measurements, {{we used the}} same approach as described by (Xiong et al. 2010). Electron density (Ne) time series from each equatorial orbital segment (within ± 40 ° magnetic latitude, MLAT) are first high-pass filtered with a cutoff period of 40  s, corresponding to an along-track wavelength of about 300  km. The magnetic latitude we used is calculated by the Apex or Quasi-Dipole magnetic field model, which has been defined by Richmond (1995) and updated by Emmert et al. (2010). Subsequently, the filtered signal is rectified. Values exceeding an upper limit (UL) are identified as an EPI event. For each event, the <b>rectified</b> <b>signal</b> should have multi-peaked values above UL, and this event is limited along the orbit, by rectified signals below a lower limit (LL) for at least 3 ° {{north and south of}} the event. Otherwise, the fluctuations of <b>rectified</b> <b>signal</b> are attributed to enhanced noise and are considered as not significant. The thresholds of UL and LL are set here to 3  ×  1010  m− 3 and 1.5  ×  1010  m− 3, respectively, which are mainly estimated from the level of quiet-time Ne variations at Swarm altitudes. Using such a method for detecting plasma irregularities, we focus on EPIs with plasma structures scale lengths less than 300  km.|$|E
