25|$|A ram blowout {{preventer}} {{is a large}} valve that can seal off a wellhead by using ram-types employing steel cut off rams to seal the borehole. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig. In 1922, James Smither Abercrombie collaborated with Harry S. Cameron {{with the idea of}} creating a mechanically operated <b>ram-type</b> {{blowout preventer}}. A patent was issued in January 1926.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ram-type</b> mill This {{can refer}} to any mill that has a cutting head mounted on a sliding ram. The spindle can be {{oriented}} either vertically or horizontally. In practice most mills with rams also involve swiveling ability, {{whether or not it}} is called [...] "turret" [...] mounting. The Bridgeport [...] can be classified as a vertical-head <b>ram-type</b> mill. Van Norman specialized in <b>ram-type</b> mills through most of the 20th century. Since the wide dissemination of CNC machines, <b>ram-type</b> mills are still made in the Bridgeport configuration (with either manual or CNC control), but the less common variations (such as were built by Van Norman, Index, and others) have died out, their work being done now by either Bridgeport-form mills or machining centers.|$|E

5000|$|The Cameron <b>ram-type</b> blowout {{preventer}} {{was the first}} successful {{blowout preventer}} (BOP) for oil wells. It was developed by James S. Abercrombie and Harry S. Cameron in 1922. The device was issued [...] on January 12, 1926. The blowout preventer was designated as a Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 2003.|$|E
50|$|James Smither Abercrombie (1891-1975), a Texas oil driller, and Harry S. Cameron (1872-1928), who {{operated}} a machine shop, formed the Cameron Iron Works in 1920. Abercrombie {{had an idea}} for a blowout preventer and took it to Cameron. They designed and built the device at the Cameron Iron works. This resulted in the first <b>ram-type</b> blowout preventer, which they called the MO BOP.|$|E
50|$|A <b>ram-type</b> BOP {{is similar}} in {{operation}} to a gate valve, but uses a pair of opposing steel plungers, rams. The rams extend {{toward the center of}} the wellbore to restrict flow or retract open in order to permit flow. The inner and top faces of the rams are fitted with packers (elastomeric seals) that press against each other, against the wellbore, and around tubing running through the wellbore. Outlets at the sides of the BOP housing (body) are used for connection to choke and kill lines or valves.|$|E
50|$|Energy {{designs and}} {{manufactures}} custom welded hydraulic cylinders. It also designs and manufactures hydraulic valves, pumps, powerpacks and power systems. Energy's cylinders {{are used in}} construction, road machinery, forestry, man lift and hoist, industrial bailer, waste compacting, and agricultural industries. Energy manufactures {{a wide variety of}} hydraulic cylinders; welded, tie-rod, <b>ram-type,</b> rephasing, telescopic, and position-sensing. Energy has designed and manufactured hydraulic cylinders with bores from less than one inch (2.5 cm), up to 11 inches (28 cm). Cylinders have been manufactured with strokes up to 15 feet (4.5 cm). Energy has designed cylinders with working pressures as high as 10,000 psig (690 bar).|$|E
50|$|Exploitable {{reservoirs}} {{of oil and}} gas {{are increasingly}} rare and remote, leading to increased subsea deepwater well exploration and requiring BOPs to remain submerged for as long as a year in extreme conditions. As a result, BOP assemblies have grown larger and heavier (e.g. a single <b>ram-type</b> BOP unit can weigh in excess of 30,000 pounds), while the space allotted for BOP stacks on existing offshore rigs has not grown commensurately. Thus a key focus in the technological development of BOPs {{over the last two decades}} has been limiting their footprint and weight while simultaneously increasing safe operating capacity.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "capstan lathe" [...] {{overlaps}} in sense {{with the}} term [...] "turret lathe" [...] to a large extent. In many times and places, it has been understood to be synonymous with [...] "turret lathe". In other times and places it has been held in technical contradistinction to [...] "turret lathe", with the difference being in whether the turret's slide is fixed to the bed (<b>ram-type</b> turret) or slides on the bed's ways (saddle-type turret). The difference in terminology is mostly a matter of United Kingdom and Commonwealth usage versus United States usage. American usage tends to call them all [...] "turret lathes".|$|E
5000|$|On 2 June 1957 the Oiseau Bleu {{was one of}} {{the initial}} {{services}} {{at the start of the}} Trans Europ Express (TEE) network. Until 31 May 1964 the Oiseau Bleu was part of the joint Dutch-Swiss TEE service provided by <b>RAm-type</b> diesel multiple unit trainsets. The Dutch and Swiss railways scheduled the use of each TEE trainset on a five-day cycle: Day 1 Zürich-Amsterdam (TEE Edelweiss), Day 2 Amsterdam-Paris (TEE Étoile du Nord) in the morning and Paris-Brussels (TEE Oiseau Bleu) in the evening, Day 3 Brussels - Paris (TEE Oiseau Bleu) in the morning and Paris-Amsterdam (TEE Étoile du Nord) in the evening, Day 4 Amsterdam-Zürich (TEE Edelweiss), Day 5 maintenance in Zürich.|$|E
5000|$|In 1936, Rudolph Bannow (1897-1962) {{conceived}} {{of a major}} improvement to the milling machine. His company commenced manufacturing a new knee-and-column vertical mill in 1938. This was the Bridgeport milling machine, often called a <b>ram-type</b> or turret-type mill because its head has sliding-ram and rotating-turret mounting. The machine became so popular that many other manufacturers created copies and variants. Furthermore, its name came to connote any such variant. The Bridgeport offered enduring advantages over previous models. It was small enough, light enough, and affordable {{enough to be a}} practical acquisition for even the smallest machine shop businesses, yet it was also smartly designed, versatile, well-built, and rigid. Its various directions of sliding and pivoting movement allowed the head to approach the work from any angle. The Bridgeport's design became the dominant form for manual milling machines used by several generations of small- and medium-enterprise machinists. By the 1980s an estimated quarter-million Bridgeport milling machines had been built, and they (and their clones) are still being produced today.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The wakeup {{logic in}} out-of-order superscalar {{microprocessors}} {{is responsible for}} resolving the data dependency hazard between instructions. Its performance is critical because it may prevent the processor to have deeper pipelines or to achieve the highest IPC (Instructions Per Cycle) possible. In this thesis, we implemented the circuit and layout for two types of wakeup logic (CAM-type and <b>RAM-type)</b> used in the modem microprocessors. These two implementations are simulated extensively using a circuit level simulator - HSPICE, with full parasitic loads. We, then, made comparison between the CAM-type and <b>RAM-type</b> wakeup circuits. From the simulation results, the CAM-type wakeup logic has a better performance than the <b>RAM-type</b> wakeup logic if {{a larger number of}} physical registers is employed by the processor. The performance impacts caused by varying the other superscalar design parameters, such as instruction window size and issue width, are not much different for both types of wakeup logic implementations...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{investigation}} {{was conducted at}} Mach number 1. 88 to determine performance characteristics of half a 50 degree-conical-spike inlet mounted on a flat plate. Initial boundary layer was removed up-stream of inlet by a <b>ram-type</b> scoop of variable height. Initial boundary-layer thickness was also varied. With complete removal of initial boundary layer, total-pressure recovery of approximately 70 percent. Several alternative boundary-layer-removal systems were investigated which decreased the adverse effect of operating the ram scoop sub-critically...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} is to present a self-testable FIFO memory macrocell, which can be {{embedded}} into larger devices. A dual port <b>RAM-type</b> FIFO has been designed. A new test procedure for the macrocell has been defined aiming at detecting all possible faults in the control logic and the RAM cell. Given such a test procedure the appropriate Built-In Self Test architecture has been defined, independently of the memory size. Fault coverage and area overhead for the proposed solution are presented. I. Introduction FIFO (First In First Out) memories have acquired a larger interest in VLSI design in telecom applications. Such macrocells provide an efficient way to interface two asynchronous systems, buffering data between subsystems operating at different data rates, thus increasing the flexibility in data transmission. In fact, data in FIFO memories are read following the same order in which they have been written, without the need of providing the address of the data. Different approaches hav [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 A new {{approach}} to oversampled delta-sigma A/D converters (AZ modulators) is introduced, where a differential pseudo-Npath filter stage {{is used as a}} basic cell. In this band-pass application, the z to -zN transformation is employed to realize a <b>RAM-type</b> pseudo- 2 -path lossless integrator. The bandpass second-order and 4 th-order delta-sigma A/D converters are implemented by switched-capacitor (SC) circuits using this kind of integrator. The effects of components inaccuracy, finite op-amp gain, as well as clock feed-through noise are studied in simulations. The results verify that such A/D converters possess a remarkable insensitivity to imperfect components and a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A 6 th-order dual-quantizer delta-sigma A/D converter with a digital canceller is then designed, which achieves 86 dB (> 14 bit) conversion accuracy and 95 dB (> 15 bit) dynamic range for a low oversampling ratio (OSR= 32) even with low-accuracy analog components (4 -bit internal D/A with 6 -bit linearity) ...|$|E
40|$|Chiral {{coatings}} {{have been}} advocated {{in the past}} for management and reduction of radar cross section of a variety of scattering objects. The theoretical analysis of the scattering from chirally coated bodies is complicated {{due to the fact that}} the left and right circularly polarized waves propagate in the chiral layer with different propagation constants. In this paper, a generalized EBCM or the T-matrix method has been used to analyse the scattering from chirally coated scatterers. The scattering characteristics, viz., absorption, extinction, radar and scattering cross sections have been computed for both <b>RAM-type</b> chiral polymers and realistic chiral materials. The results have been presented for various size parameters, angles of incidence, coating thickness and for various volume concentrations of embedded metal helices. From the results it can be seen the normalized radar cross section of a chirally coated spheroid is 10 – 15 dB lower than the conducting spheroid over wider ranges of angles of incidence. This performance is also superior in comparison with the conventional RAMs. This reduction in the RCS has been shown to be due to increased absorption and reduced scattering cross section...|$|E
40|$|The high {{complexity}} of technological {{systems and the}} increasing requirement and competitiveness of markets request the implementation of adequate management strategies for these systems {{in order to improve}} their availability and productivity. In this context, RAM factors constitute a strategic approach for integrating reliability, availability and maintainability, by using methods, tools and engineering techniques to identify and quantify equipment and system failures that prevent the achievement of its objectives. This paper presents the most relevant aspects and findings of a study conducted for assessing the operational performance of a wind turbine system installed in a wind farm in Portugal. The study was based on the analysis of the behavior of states defined for each individual wind turbine over a period of two years, and was aimed to identify and evaluate the effects of <b>RAM-type</b> factors. Given the structure and nature of the data, a Markov Chain approach was adopted for this evaluation. The main finding was that the usage of a particular technique (the frequency and duration technique) is adequate to effectively evaluate the overall performance of the wind farm and find opportunities for improvements.

40|$|In a basic, <b>ram-type</b> EDM system (figure 1 - 1 O), the {{ram head}} is driven {{up and down}} with extreme {{accuracy}} by a servodriven system. The servo system is controlled by a microprocessor connected to the power supply. The power supply is solid-state and is also microprocessor controlled. One lead from the power supply is connected to the workpiece, which is immersed in a tank of dielectric oil. The dielectric tank is connected to a dielectric pump, an oil reservoir, and a filter system. The pump provides pressure for flushing the work area and moving the oil while the filter system removes and traps debris in the oil. The oil reservoir stores surplus oil and provides a container for draining the oil between operations. The other lead from the power supply is connected to the electrode. The power supply provides a pulsed DC output to the electrode/workpiece system. On-times and off-times are set manually, along with voltage and current values. When the EDM machine is turned on, the servo microprocessor, sensing that the gap is too wide for cutting to take place, signals the servo mechanism to lower the ram head. When the first spark jumps the gap, downward travel of the ram head stops. With the gap setting held constant, the process gradually erodes the surface. When enough metal has been removed to change the gap distance, the microprocessor senses this and signals the servo mechanism to advance the ram head sufficiently to maintain the proper gap width, and the process continues...|$|E
40|$|The Oil & Gas {{industry}} has continuously increased its requirements and {{together with the}} high complexity of technological systems and the higher competitiveness of markets, has compelled providers to implement adequate management strategies for these systems {{in order to improve}} their availability and productivity to meet those more demanding criteria. In this context, the complex of RAM factors constitute a strategic approach for integrating reliability, availability and maintainability, by using methods, tools and engineering techniques (Mean Time to Failure, Equipment down Time and System Availability values) to identify and quantify equipment and system failures that prevent the achievement of the productive objectives. The application of such methodologies requires a deep experience and know-how together with the possibility of acquiring and processing data in operating conditions. This paper presents the most relevant aspects and findings of a study conducted for assessing the operational performance of a reciprocating compressor system package installed and used in the oil and gas' industries. The study was based on the analysis of the behaviour of states defined for each individual parts and component of reciprocating compressor and also aimed to identify and evaluate the effects of <b>RAM-type</b> factors and was conducted in collaboration with a private company that, for privacy reasons, will be named RC company. The Methodologies procedures used in this descriptive study were the bibliographical research, documentary and content analysis of the main literature.
