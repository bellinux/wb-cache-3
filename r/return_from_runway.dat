Delhi Police Special Cell {{received}} {{information that}} two people from a designated terrorist group based in Kashmir known as Jaish-e-Mohammed had entered the city. Security was tightened across the city, and additional security personnel were added in view of Republic Day Parade to be held on 26 January. New Delhi-Lucknow Shatabdi Express, which left from Delhi, was stopped and checked thoroughly after a bomb threat on 2 January. In another instance at the Mumbai airport, a Turkish Airlines plane was ordered to <b>return</b> <b>from</b> the <b>runway</b> to the parking area after an unclaimed mobile phone was found on a seat. New boarding passes were distributed and passengers had to undergo a full security check a second time before boarding the plane again, causing a delay of four hours. The flight landed safely in Istanbul. Mumbai, the financial capital of the country, and Hindon Air Force Station, located {{on the outskirts of}} Delhi, were also put on high alert.

Such an aircraft would operate at speeds very similar to those used by current short haul transports, the main difference being in the need to provide a static thrust/weight ratio of the order of 0, 4.
