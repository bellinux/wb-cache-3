How to mine the signification information from RFID events is a challenge in <b>RFID</b> <b>applications.</b> In this paper, we take an CEP Pattem-oriented approach to process RFID data. A novel event pattern based on semantics operator is proposed. A formalization event hierarchy is used to model complex event with the event ontology, and provides abstract hierarchical views allowing us to view the system activities at different levels. Several complex event patterns are proposed based on semantic event operators. An algorithm is performed to test reorganization performance of patterns, a rule-based method is used to recognize efficiently on primitive event and composite event.

40|$|Middleware is a {{layer of}} the {{software}} that connects and manages application components running on distributed hosts. Several types of middleware are reflective middleware, eventbased middleware, object-oriented middleware, and message-oriented middleware. Adaptive middleware is part of reflective middleware, that allows the system’s behavior to be altered at run time to better match the system’s current operating environment (e. g. whether the system is being debugged or operating in a real-time environment or in a secure environment). Many vendors develop the middleware as distributed software. Sun, IBM, CORBA, Microsoft and Sybase provide its own architecture in many purposes such as in communication, manufactory, medical, and financial application. IBM offered the RFID infrastructure which had adaptive characteristics. It supported multiple RFID reader devices and minimized network overload. In Radio Frequency Identification (<b>RFID)</b> <b>application</b> in particular, middleware is implemented for increasing the system performance in network communication, coordination, reliability, scalability, and heterogeneity. <b>RFID</b> <b>application</b> is used to process data sent to and received from radio frequency identification (RFID) devices such as RFID readers, writers, and printers. Non adaptive system can not modify its behavior in response to change in new situation and disturbances, so by design of adaptive middleware in <b>RFID</b> <b>application,</b> can increase the system’s performance; more flexible, robust and can adapt to disturbances.

40|$|Tag cloning attacks {{threaten}} {{a variety}} of Radio Frequency Identification (<b>RFID)</b> <b>applications</b> but are hard to prevent. To secure <b>RFID</b> <b>applications</b> that confine tagged objects in the same RFID system, this paper studies the cloned-tag identification problem. Although limited existing work has {{shed some light on}} the problem, designing fast cloned-tag identification protocols for <b>applications</b> in large-scale <b>RFID</b> systems is yet not thoroughly investigated. To this end, we propose leveraging broadcast and collisions to identify cloned tags. This approach relieves us from resorting to complex cryptography techniques and time-consuming transmission of tag IDs. Based on this approach, we derive a time lower bound on cloned-tag identification and propose a suite of time-efficient protocols toward approaching the time lower bound. The execution time of our protocol is only 1. 4 times the value of the time lower bound, being over 91 % less than that of the existing protocol. Even better, we further dig up an adaptive protocol that can yield higher time efficiency under some scenarios.

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, {{the vital}} {{parts of the}} {{business}} programs are the data warehouses and the data mining techniques. Especially these are vital in the Radio Frequency Identification (<b>RFID)</b> <b>application</b> which brings a revolution in business programs. Manufacturing, the logistics distribution and various stages of supply chains, retail store and quality management applications {{are involved in the}} RFID technology in business. A large volume of temporal and spatial data is generated by the ubiquitous computing and sensor networks of RFID and these are often generated with noises and duplicates. The noises and duplicates in the RFID data declare the need of an effective data warehousing system. The warehousing system has the responsibility to provide proper data cleaning technique to clean the dirty data which occurs in the applications. Also, the cleaned data has to be transformed and to be loaded properly {{so that they can be}} stored in the database with minimum space requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel data cleaning, transformation and loading technique which makes the data warehousing system employed for any <b>RFID</b> <b>applications</b> more effective. The chosen <b>RFID</b> <b>application</b> is tracking of goods in warehouses using RFID tags and readers, one of the significant <b>RFID</b> <b>applications.</b> The data cleaning is performed based on the probability of each RFID tag’s response and the window size which is made adaptive. The window size changes on the basis of the occurrence of the dirty data and hence the cleaning is more effective.
