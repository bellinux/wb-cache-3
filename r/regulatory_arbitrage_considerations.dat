40|$|Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> The work seeks to identify opportunities for <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> under Basel I and Basel II accords. The aim of the thesis is to determine whether banks engaged in <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> and how it affected the financial system. In examining <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> {{it was found that}} the Basel I and Basel II provided a potential for <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> and banks did not hesitate to engage in it. The thesis identifies that the main problem of banking regulation is the change in incentives of players in the financial markets leading to <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> and consequently to a greater concentration of risk in financial markets. The work suggests a creation of the fourth pillar of the Basel accords, which would provide rules for bank resolution mechanisms. Thus, it tries to alleviate the problem of moral hazard currently present in the banking system...|$|R
40|$|Hedge funds, as paragons of {{exploiting}} regulatory discrepancies, {{are heavily}} criticized for thwarting regulatory {{efforts to address}} systemic risk. This paper investigates arbitrage seeking behavior of hedge funds in the globally-fragmented financial <b>regulatory</b> framework. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> is viewed as an indispensible element of regulatory competition, which {{plays a significant role}} in delivering the benefits of regulatory competition by providing regulatory substitutes for regulated firms, thereby increasing the elasticity of demand for regulators and engendering regulatory accountability. Despite its benefits, <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> involve costs. Market discipline can constrain the negative externalities of <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> however, this paper argues that due to certain idiosyncratic features of the hedge fund industry, such as sophistication of investor base, higher attrition rate, and lack of transparency, market discipline by itself cannot fully address the potential externalities of <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> by hedge funds. These features weaken market signals and reduce the reputational advantages of being subject to high-quality regulation. The lower reputational costs in turn reduce the overall costs of <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> for hedge funds compared with mainstream financial institutions, which makes it more likely for hedge funds to engage in <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> than other mainstream financial institutions do. In a departure from the mainstream research, which recommends regulatory coordination, cooperation, harmonization, and consolidation as legal remedies to address problems originating from <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> by hedge funds, this paper argues that such proposals are at best misguided and at worst systemic risk amplifier.

40|$|<b>Regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> is an {{indispensable}} element of regulatory competition as it provides regulatory substitutes for firms, and allows those firms to optimally benefit from such competition. This also increases the elasticity {{of demand for}} regulators and engenders accountability among them. Hedge funds, as paragons of exploiting regulatory discrepancies, are heavily criticized for thwarting efforts to address systemic risk. This Article investigates the arbitrage-seeking behavior of hedge funds in a globally-fragmented financial regulatory framework. Despite its benefits, <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> involves certain costs. Although market discipline can constrain these negative externalities, due to certain idiosyncratic features of the hedge fund industry, such as the sophistication of investor base, operational mobility, higher attrition rate, and lack of transparency, market discipline by itself cannot fully limit the potential externalities of <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> by hedge funds. These features weaken market signals and reduce the reputational benefits of being subject to greater regulatory oversight. The lower reputational costs and broad private investor exemptions in turn reduce the overall costs of <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> for hedge funds in comparison to other financial services providers and mainstream financial institutions, {{and make it more}} likely for hedge funds to engage in <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> In a departure from mainstream research, which recommends regulatory coordination, cooperation, harmonization, and consolidation as legal remedies to address problems originating from <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> by hedge funds, this Article argues that such proposals are at best misguided and at worst systemic risk amplifiers.

40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the reasons that}} banks and other financial institutions engage in <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage</b> and the techniques they use to do so. <b>Regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage</b> describes transactions and structures that firms use to lower the effective regulatory “tax rate” of regulatory capital requirements. To the extent that these regulations force financial institutions to internalize the externalities created by their potential insolvency (including systemic risk externalities), the incentives to engage in <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage</b> will persist. Financial institutions employ a range of complex transactions and structures, including securitization, to engage in <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage.</b> The article briefly sketches how capital regulations and <b>regulatory</b> capital <b>arbitrage</b> have evolved in dialectical fashion.

50|$|<b>Regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> {{is where}} a {{regulated}} institution {{takes advantage of the}} difference between its real (or economic) risk and the regulatory position. For example, if a bank, operating under the Basel I accord, has to hold 8% capital against default risk, but the real risk of default is lower, it is profitable to securitise the loan, removing the low risk loan from its portfolio. On the other hand, if the real risk is higher than the regulatory risk then it is profitable to make that loan and hold on to it, provided it is priced appropriately. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> can result in parts of entire businesses being unregulated {{as a result of the}} arbitrage.|$|R

However, imperfect information about the ratio of required capital, or, {{in the context of}} the sub-prime crisis, the extent of <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> introduces uncertainty about the risk exposure of intermediaries. Underestimation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> may induce households to infer that higher asset prices are due to a decline of risk. First, this mechanism can explain why the risk premia paid by US financial intermediaries did not increase between 2000 and 2007 in spite of its increasing leverage.

First, the spurious flows of funds to and from China, via the underreporting of exports and the overreporting of imports, closely follow the preferential tax incentives accorded to foreign investors. Second, the underreporting of exports is negatively related to export tax rebates. Third, the overreporting of imports is negatively related to import tariffs.

40|$|We {{propose a}} theory of <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> by banks and test it using trust {{preferred}} securities (TPS) issuance. From 1996 to 2007, U. S. banks in the aggregate increased their regulatory capital through issuance of TPS while their net issuance of common stock was negative due to repurchases. We assume that, {{in the absence of}} capital requirements, a bank has an optimal capital structure that depends on its business model. Capital requirements can impose constraints on bank decisions. If a bank’s optimal capital structure also meets regulatory capital requirements with a sufficient buffer, the bank is unconstrained by these requirements. We expect that unconstrained banks will not issue TPS, that constrained banks will issue TPS and engage in other forms of <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> and that banks with TPS will be riskier than other banks with the same amount of regulatory capital, and therefore, more adversely affected by the credit crisis.

This paper attempts to explain the economics that supports the demand/supply for this market, the systemic risks that can arise, and regulatory and broader policy implications.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the Global Financial Crisis, there has been an {{understandable}} focus on the financial fragility and contagion aspects of shadow banking. This article argues that shadow banking is important for another set of reasons. It has been well established that shadow banking permits the transformation of assets and financial claims. It has also been established that fiscal and <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> occurs through shadow banking, and associated offshore financial activities. The article develops the argument that together these are transforming the times and spaces of modern finance, and directly challenging earlier spatio-temporal concepts of finance, and the regulatory/jurisdictional order built on them. The article suggests that the longer term significance of shadow banking may not just be its role in financial crisis, or even tax and <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> but that it was here that innovative forms of capital were produced and generalised which transcended the spaces and times of earlier institutional, transactional and jurisdictional concepts of capital and wealth...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{a banking}} model of {{maturity}} transformation in which <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> induces the coexistence of regulated commercial banks and unregulated shadow banks. We derive three main results: First, the relative {{size of the}} shadow banking sector determines {{the stability of the}} financial system. If the shadow banking sector is small relative to the capacity of secondary markets for shadow banks' assets, shadow banking is stable. In turn, if the sector grows too large, it becomes fragile: an additional equilibrium emerges that is characterized by a panic-based run in the shadow banking sector. Second, if regulated commercial banks themselves operate shadow banks, a larger shadow banking sector is sustainable. However, once the threat of a crisis reappears, a crisis in the shadow banking sector spreads to the commercial banking sector. Third, in the presence of <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> a safety net for banks may fail to prevent a banking crisis. Moreover, the safety net may be tested and may eventually become costly for the regulator...|$|R

Consistent with such recourse, we find that conduits provided little risk transfer during the “run”: losses from conduits remained with banks rather than outside investors and banks with more exposure to conduits had lower stock returns.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{an issue}} of regulatory competition {{that seems to be}} of greater interest for the corporate governance of large, publicly traded firms: the position of the employees. The Article proceeds in three parts. Part I sets out the basic premise of the analysis by describing why employees may be relevant to the corporate governance structure. This Part will briefly draw on economic theory to explain why, at least under certain circumstances, it can be beneficial to create an institutional structure that facilitates long-term commitment between firms and their employees. Part II identifies aspects of European corporate law that are relevant to labor and corporate law arbitrage opportunities. After delineating the scope of <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> this Part describes the three main issues that surround <b>regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> The most important of these are employee participation systems, which give employee representatives a say in corporate governance. The second issue relates to the controversial issue of directors 2 ̆ 7 duties, with special attention to the extent that directors may defend against hostile takeovers. A third and often overlooked issue {{is the degree to which}} directors are independent from shareholder intervention. Finally, Part III presents the core of the analysis by describing the economic consequences of ex ante and ex post <b>regulatory</b> choice. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>arbitrage</b> provides the advantages of increased flexibility and possibilities to avoid some obviously inefficient regulation. On the other hand, mechanisms that may help to foster long-term commitment of firm employees are undermined by ex post arbitrage opportunities because of shareholders inability to permanently commit to a particular system.
