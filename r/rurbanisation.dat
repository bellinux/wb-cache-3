It is the place of invention for new economic, social, and power practices, linked to the fundamental process of <b>rurbanisation.</b> In this paper, we propose to analyze {{the reasons for this}} movement and to find ways to better organize the rurban, taking into account transportation, services, habitat, social and cultural cooperation and governance, in a context of sustainability. We see the rurban as a milieu for our future, producing wealth and quality of life, in the tradition of desurbanists. rurban, governance, quality of life, <b>rurbanisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Brussels: the {{slackening}} of counter-urbanization The {{process of}} urbanization - suburbanization has been {{followed in the}} Brussels area during the seventies by a very intensive counter-urbanization. The migration flow is positive in the rural districts for the 25 - 40 years old households with their children under 10 years. Around 20 years, on the contrary, migration to town is more important, {{as it is for}} unmarried people. Since 1979 a slackening of the urban to rural shift is observed, and seems to be linked with the economic crisis. Laconte Pierre, Poulain Michel.

40|$|Abstract : Social {{geography}} {{tools are}} used to examine agreements - or disagreements - and to conduct a diachronic analysis of land-use planning documents in four peri-urban communes. It is shown that these documents tend {{to move away from}} representations of agricultural activity towards representations of agricultural space where landscape and environmental functions are combined with the agricultural function. In these constructions, the policies adopted at the intercommunal scale {{are used to}} support and legitimise choices made by each commune, choices that go from die expression of a process of <b>rurbanisation</b> or peri-urbanisation, where agriculture is relegated to the slopes, to the maintenance of agriculture in those areas where its potential is high.

40|$|The {{article is}} an extract from two {{different}} sociological researches: Social Structure and Quality of Living in the Period of Transition (CITADA - IDIZ, 1996), Village in Transition: Developmental Possibilities of Rural Areas (IDIZ, 1996 - 1999), and many other field and action researches on different topics, housing being one of them, as the part of “quality of living” approach. The paper is, as well, the ‘synthesis’ of two papers from international housing conferences held in Tallinn - Estonia, 1997 and in Vilnius - Lithuania, 1999 - In the article, the author starts with analysis of the social context marked by transition on general level and specific Croatian features (in privatisation, urbanisation, ruralisation, <b>rurbanisation)</b> influencing housing situation and housing policy. The stress is put on similarities (convergences) and differences (divergences) in understanding of housing in villages and cities. The main hypothesis is {{that in spite of}} huge differences in understanding of rural and urban housing, in quality of living in general, they are changing in favour of convergence. The reasons are in urbanisation of villages (differentiation of social structure and activities, increase of communal infrastructure and general social changes) as well as in ruralisation of cities (immigration of rural population with it’s own values and quality of living). Measuring the quality of housing with numerous indicators (objective and subjective ones) on the level of house/apartment, neighbourhood/quarter and on settlement level all the data show less differences on house/apartment and neighbourhood/ quarter level (on elementary level) than on settlement level. Favours go for cities, and disadvantages for villages. The conclusions are not pink. They show worse situation in villages and parish centres (dying of small settlements), while in cities problems are connected with "false standard”, ruralisation of the pheriphery and even the very cores, and weak urban planning as their corrector.
