40|$|The {{performances}} of the BDProbeTec ET (Becton Dickinson) and COBAS AMPLICOR MTB (Roche) were retrospectively evaluated for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in various respiratory specimens. The BACTEC and MGIT liquid culture system (Becton Dickinson) {{was used as a}} reference method. A total of 824 respiratory specimens, comprised of sputa, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and bronchial and tracheal aspirates from 580 patients, were evaluated. Out of 824 clinical specimens, 109 specimens from 43 patients were culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Of these 109 specimens, 67 were smear positive, 85 were positive by the COBAS AMPLICOR MTB test, and 94 were positive by the BDProbeTec ET. Of the 715 culture-negative specimens, 17 were positive by the auramine staining, 11 were positive by the COBAS AMPLICOR MTB test, and 12 were positive by the BDProbeTec ET. After discrepancy analysis and review of the patients' clinical data, 130 specimens from 50 patients were considered "true-positive" specimens. This resulted in the following sensitivities: microscopy, 61. 5 %; COBAS AMPLICOR MTB test, 78. 0 %; and BDProbeTec ET, 86. 2 %. The specificities of each system, based on the clinical diagnosis, were 99. 7 % for microscopy, 99. 9 % for the COBAS AMPLICOR MTB test, and 99. 9 % for the BDProbeTec ET. The data presented represent a considerable number of specimens evaluated with a considerable number of culture- and auramine-positive and culture-positive and auramine-negative results and therefore give a realistic view of how the data should be interpreted in a daily <b>routine</b> <b>situation.</b> Specifically, the data with regard to the culture-positive and auramine-negative specimens are useful, because in a <b>routine</b> <b>situation,</b> auramine-negative specimens are sometimes accepted, on clinical indications, to be analyzed by an amplification method...|$|R
50|$|Another {{limit of}} {{familiarity}} heuristic {{according to a}} study by Ouellette & Wood (1998) is that it might not always be applicable.

Thus, the familiarity heuristic could be limited to habits and behaviors in <b>routine</b> <b>situations.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} {{of media and}} policymakers is symbiotic and is controlled by shared culture of unofficial set of ground rules as journalists need access to official information and policymakers need media coverage; nevertheless the needs of journalists and policymakers are often incompatible because of their different orientation in time as powerful sources are at their best in <b>routine</b> <b>situations</b> and react more slowly when crisis or disaster occur. Consequently, policymakers who understand the rules of this culture the best will be most capable of setting their agendas and issue definitions. On the other hand, media also influence policymakers when government officials and politicians take the amount of media attention given to an issue as an indirect expression of public interest in the issue.|$|E
50|$|This {{may also}} be due to {{processing}} effects, in particular assimilation and accommodation effects. Assimilation effects rely on an individual's prior knowledge to guide their behavior in a situation and accommodation effects rely on careful monitoring of a situation and a greater attention to concrete information. Assimilative processing is ideal for safe, <b>routine</b> <b>situations</b> while accommodative processing is for problematic situations. Happy people tend to use assimilative processing, which leads to more daring and direct disclosures, while unhappy people use accommodative processing, which leads {{them to be more}} cautious in their disclosures. These accommodating effects for unhappy people tend to increase reciprocity because these individuals will match the level of disclosure from their partner but will not go beyond that.|$|E
40|$|Thirty {{patients}} in whom others found equivocal plantar reflexes were studied clinically and electromyographically (EMG-og flexor hallucis brevis, extensor hallucis longus, and tibialis anterior), during mechanical {{stimulation of the}} sole. Bias of recording or interpretation of EMG was excluded. The study was repeated after one week; the EMG outcome was reproducible in 26 patients (87 %). Of these 26, a pathological reflex was suspected by the clinician in 17, but shown by EMG in only six patients. Compared with the 'final' diagnosis, false-pathological EMG results did not occur; conversely, EMG criteria were wide enough to demonstrate expected, but clinically unconvincing, Babinski signs. Various factors that cause false impressions in the <b>routine</b> <b>situation</b> could be identified.

40|$|The current {{literature}} on venous access in {{infants and children}} for acute intravascular access in the <b>routine</b> <b>situation</b> and in emergency or intensive care settings is reviewed. The various techniques for facilitating venous cannulation, such as application of local warmth, transillumination techniques and epidermal nitroglycerine, are described. Preferred sites for central venous access in infants and children are the external and internal jugular veins, the subclavian and axillary veins, and the femoral vein. Femoral venous cannulation {{appears to be the}} most safe and reliable technique in children of all ages, with high success and low complication rates. Evidence from the reviewed literature strongly supports the use of real-time ultrasound techniques for venous cannulation in infants and children. Additionally, in emergency situations intraosseous access has almost completely replaced saphenous cutdown procedures in children and has decreased the need for immediate central venous access...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we employ {{developments}} in social network analysis (SNA), specifically the p* model, to examine the enactment of plural leadership within, and across, hierarchical levels and organizational boundaries (Denis et al., 2012). Drawing on an empirical study of an inter-professional, inter-organizational network (number of nodes = 23) that delivers health and social care, we address two research gaps: (i) the effect of power relations, derived from professional hierarchy, upon spread of plural leadership; and (ii) the effect of formal leadership, derived from managerial accountability, in channeling the spread of plural leadership for coherent strategic effect. We show that, in a <b>routine</b> <b>situation,</b> the network is characterized by generalized leadership exchanges. In this situation, professional hierarchy and managerial accountability are not visible, nor is channeling of plural leadership by the formal leader. In a non-routine situation, when a disruptive event occurs, the network is characterized by restricted exchange. In this situation, professional hierarchy and managerial accountability are evident, and a formal leader channels plural leadership...|$|R

5000|$|The {{methodology}} {{consists of}} noticing and clarifying {{what is happening}} routinely and [...] "then having the willingness and ability to stop it". [...] The method focuses on a recurring reaction and pattern of behavior of the individual {{in relation to a}} <b>routine</b> <b>situation</b> which one wants to alter, maintaining that what a person can really control and be responsible for, is his own reaction. Stopping is a physical act done with body attention, will and choice, to discontinue the part of the experience that one can perceive and control. For example: a person is scared while studying for an exam and reacts with shallow breathing, contracting the shoulders and diaphragm, locking the knees, becoming worried, and disliking situation. By paying attention to one's body and learning to purposefully reproduce and to stop all these behavior, [...] "...the person can choose to refuse the reaction, relax the shoulders and diaphragm, unlock the knees, breathe differently and stop judging and blaming". Letting the body work is a term used to describe the act of allowing the body to function more freely and rebalance itself.|$|R

30|$|First, skill-based {{behavior}} {{refers to}} automated and highly integrated actions {{that can occur}} using few attentional resources. Behavior at the skill-based level is governed by patterns of activity stored in memory for well-practiced, <b>routine</b> <b>situations</b> [26]. Rule-based behavior is more goal-oriented in nature. Behavior at this level follows a set of stored rules or procedures [26], requiring an individual to direct conscious attention to recognizing a situation and retrieving appropriate rules from memory. Finally, knowledge-based behavior is required for unfamiliar situations, for {{which there are no}} pre-specified rules or procedures. In these situations, the individual must plan actions using conscious analytical processes [26], which places heavy demand on attentional resources [27, 28].|$|E

40|$|Configuration {{management}} (CM) includes synchronizing {{and supporting}} developers in their common development {{and maintenance of}} a system. The rapid development of the Internet and time-to-market pressure affects software development. In order to utilize skilled personnel despite geographical location, groups of developers are now working {{all over the world}} on the development of common systems, a situation called distributed development. From different locations they may need to concurrently modify thousands of files, sometimes the same files, within the product. When the prerequisites change this implies new, and harder, demands on CM support. This thesis presents two studies on configuration management. The first one focuses on a CM system and an evaluation of its functionality in the particular situation of a company with well-defined CM <b>routines.</b> <b>Situations</b> where the system turned out to be cumbersome to use or lacking functionality are identified and improvements are outlined for how the problems can be solved or the situations better supported. The second study classifies different cases of distributed development and client-server architectures, identifies three development strategies and discusses the properties of different synchronization models with respect to distribution. The analysis is supported by interviews with several companies and is focused on CM aspects related to distributed development. Experiences and practical guidance for some CM key-areas are also presented. The results presented in this thesis provide an understanding of concurrent and distributed development and their demands on CM and CM tools. It is concluded that the CM tools of today do not adequately support distributed groups, i. e. highly interactive distributed development - a problem that must be addressed by future research...|$|R
