5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, <b>rhubarb</b> chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} plants are found {{throughout}} {{the middle and upper}} basin, including California poppy, white alder, Oregon ash, oak, poison oak, bigleaf maple, Indian <b>rhubarb,</b> buttonbush, willow, whiteleaf manzanita, and historically, sugar pine, before heavy logging in the late 19th century. Squirrels, raccoon, jackrabbits, bats, skunks, beavers, mule deer, coyote, bobcat and black bear are among the mammal species found in the middle and upper watershed.|$|E

5000|$|A {{combination}} of strawberries, red currants, black currants, blueberries and mulberries {{is known as}} [...] "forest fruits" [...] (skovbær) and is a common component in tarts and marmalades. A popular dessert is made from boiling down one or more berries or <b>rhubarbs</b> into 'rødgrød (red porridge) med fløde (with cream)'. Cream is poured on top, but may be substituted by milk.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The {{process of}} drying {{agricultural}} raw products {{is associated with}} loss of bioactive substances by the products exposed to heat, light, oxygen, or рН medium. It is reasonable to enhance the table beet processing technology {{in order to achieve}} maximum betanin conservation at lower energy consumption. Materials and methods. Table beets, <b>rhubarbs,</b> lemons, and tomatoes were dried at temperature of 50 to 100 ºС, air speed of 1. 5 to 3. 5 m/s, heat carrier water content of 7 to 15 g/kg, and layer thickness of 2 to 20 mm. The betanіn content was determined via absorption spectra, using the optical density value at 540 nm wavelength. A differential microcalorimeter was used for measuring evaporation heat consumption. Results and discussion. The effect of raw product pre-drying preparation was studied. With no preliminary preparation, the loss of betanin after drying reaches 66...|$|R
60|$|This {{accumulated}} heat in {{the upper}} strata of soil must have a very powerful effect upon vegetation, preventing the delicate rootlets of shrubs from becoming frozen, and preserving vitality in the more fleshy, roots, {{such as those of}} the large <b>rhubarbs</b> and small orchids, whose spongy cellular tissues would no doubt be ruptured by severe frosts. To the burrowing rodents, the hares, marmots, and rats, which abound at 15,000 to 17,000 feet in Tibet, this phenomenon is even more conspicuously important; for were the soil in winter to acquire the mean temperature of the air, it would take very long to heat after the melting of the snow, and indeed the latter phenomenon would be greatly retarded. The rapid development of vegetation after the disappearance of the snow, is no doubt also proximately due to the heat of the soil, quite as much as to the increased strength of the sun's direct rays in lofty regions.|$|R
5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} diurnal pattern of activity, feeding {{from dawn to}} dusk, {{stopping}} sporadically to rest and chew their cud. Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs. Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present {{in most of the}} world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, yew, <b>rhubarb,</b> potato, and rhododendron.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{exited the}} mass of {{aircraft}} and was immediately attacked by three Bf 109s. The closest was 100 yards away. Maintaining a steep, tight, spiralling turn, he dived into cloud and immediately headed for Dover. Coming out of the cloud, Johnson saw a lone Bf 109. Suspecting it {{to be one of}} the three that had chased him, he searched for the other two. Seeing nothing, Johnson attacked and shot it down. It was his fourth victory. Johnson ended his month's tally by adding a probable victory on 21 August. But it had been a bad day and month for the Wing. The much loathed Circus and <b>Rhubarb</b> raids had cost Fighter Command 108 fighters. The Germans lost just 18. On 4 September 1941 Johnson was promoted to flight lieutenant and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC).|$|E
5|$|In November 1940 Air Marshal Sholto Douglas became Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Fighter Command. On 8 December 1940 a {{directive}} from the Air Staff called for Sector Offensive Sweeps. It ordered hit-and-run operations over Belgium and France. The operations {{were to be}} conducted by three squadrons to harass German air defences. On 10 January 1941 Circus attacks were initiated by sending small bomber formations protected by large numbers of fighters. The escalation of offensive operations throughout 1941 was designed to draw up the Luftwaffe as Douglas' Command took an increasingly offensive stance. These operations {{became known as the}} Circus offensive. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, AOC 11 Group, penned Operations Instruction No. 7, which he had written on 16 February. Leigh-Mallory outlined six distinct operations for day fighters: Ramrod (bomber escort with primary goal the destruction of the target); Fighter Ramrod (The same goal where fighters escorted ground-attack fighters); Roadstead (Bomber escort and anti-shipping operations); Fighter Roadstead (the same operation as Roadstead but without bombers) along with <b>Rhubarb</b> (poor weather ground attack operation) and Circus operations (see glossary).|$|E
6000|$|The {{physicians}} {{advised him}} to leave off wine; {{but he says he}} could not do that, though he was content to use it in moderation. In truth he required something to support him against the physicians themselves, for they continued to exhaust his strength by their medicines, and could not supply the want of it with air and freedom. He had ringings in the ears, vomits, and fluxes of blood. It would be ludicrous, if it were not deplorably pathetic, to hear so great a man, in the commonest medical terms, now protesting against the eternal drenches of these practitioners, now humbly submitting to them, and now entreating like a child, that they might at least not be [...] "so bitter." [...] The physicians, with the duke at their head, were as mad for their <b>rhubarbs</b> and lancets as the quacks in Molière; and nothing but the very imagination that had nearly sacrificed the poet's life to their ignorance could have hindered him from dashing his head against the wall, and leaving them to the execrations of posterity. It is the only occasion in which the noble profession of medicine has not appeared in wise and beneficent connexion with the sufferings of men of letters. Why did Ferrara possess no Brocklesby in those days? no Garth, Mead, Warren, or Southwood Smith? ...|$|R
5000|$|A concise {{story of}} Gayōmart {{according}} to Middle Persian texts {{is given by}} Zabihollah Safa: Gayōmart Gar-shāh (King of the Mountains) was the first human Uhrmazd created. Before Gayōmart came, in the fifth [...] "Gāh" [...] (Ahura Mazda created the world in six Gāhs) Gavevagdāt was created from mud in Erān-vēdj (which {{was the middle of}} the earth) {{on the right side of}} the river [...] "Veh-Dāit" ... In the sixth [...] "Gāh" [...] Gayōmart was created from mud ... on the left side of [...] "Veh-Dāit", to help Uhrmazd and he was created as a 15-year-old boy. They lived for 3000 years in peace and they did not pray, did not eat and did not talk but Gayōmart was thinking about this. At the end of the 3000 period, which Ahriman was stunned and could not do anything Jēh yelled which woke him up ... upon this, Ahriman and his minions the Dīvs fought with the light and in the first day of the spring (1st of Farvardin, the Iranian new year) leaped onto the earth as a dragon. He started to create death, illness, lust, thirst, hunger among the life forms and spread evil beings in the world (The 'Kyrm', which includes reptiles, insects and rodents) ... In the catastrophe Gavevagdāt died ( [...] This is also the symbol of the last year giving way to the new year, as depicted in Persepolis reliefs). And Ahriman left [...] "Astovidat" [...] (A Dīv) to guard Gayōmart, but could not kill him because his fate had not yet come ... From that time he lived for 30 years and upon death fell on his left side and his semen fell to the ground which was fertilized by the sun ... and after 40 years there grew Mashya and Mashyana as two <b>rhubarbs</b> ..." [...] In the Avesta, Gayōmart is named as the pure and righteous, and according to Zoroastrian tradition the genealogy of Zoroaster can be traced through 45 generations to him.|$|R
5|$|In {{his spare}} time, Wright {{developed}} a fruit farm {{on the property}} with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the order was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden Russet, and fifty Fameuse. Among the bushes were three hundred gooseberry, two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, <b>rhubarb,</b> and plums. The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, {{which may have been}} done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.|$|E
5|$|When {{merchant}} ships docked, {{the merchandise}} {{was taken into}} official custody and taxes levied on all items sold. The security of the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials. Traders of many nationalities (Arabs, Persians, Guzerates, Khorassanians) settled in Calicut, drawn by the thriving trade business. Ship building prospered and keeled ships of 1000–1200 bahares (burden) were built without decks by sewing the entire hull with ropes rather than fastening them with nails. Ships sailed to the Red Sea ports of Aden and Mecca with Vijayanagara goods sold {{as far away as}} Venice. The empire's principal exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, myrobalan, tamarind timber, anafistula, precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, musk, ambergris, <b>rhubarb,</b> aloe, cotton cloth and porcelain. Cotton yarn was shipped to Burma and indigo to Persia. Chief imports from Palestine were copper, quicksilver (mercury), vermilion, coral, saffron, coloured velvets, rose water, knives, coloured camlets, gold and silver. Persian horses were imported to Cannanore before a two-week land trip to the capital. Silk arrived from China and sugar from Bengal.|$|E
5|$|John Herschel Glenn Jr. {{was born}} on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr., who worked for a {{plumbing}} firm, and Clara Teresa , a teacher. His parents had married shortly before his father, {{a member of the}} American Expeditionary Force, left for the Western Front during World War I. The family moved to New Concord, Ohio, soon after his birth, and his father started his own plumbing company, the Glenn Plumbing Company. He was only a toddler when he met Anna Margaret (Annie) Castor, who would later become his wife. The two {{would not be able to}} recall a time when they did not know each other. He took his first flight in an airplane with his father when he was eight years old. He became fascinated by flight, and built model airplanes from balsa wood kits. Along with his adopted sister Jean, he attended New Concord Elementary School. He washed cars and sold <b>rhubarb</b> to earn money to buy a bicycle, after which he took a job delivering The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. He was a member of the Ohio Rangers, an organisation similar to the Cub Scouts; Annie was a girl scout. His boyhood home in New Concord has been restored as a historic house museum and education center.|$|E
