40|$|The typical {{developing}} country receives official development aid {{from a large}} and often increasing number of donors, generating what policy-makers and observers now commonly refer to as “aid fragmentation”. Existing research on fragmentation stresses its {{negative impact on the}} ability of aid recipients to improve development outcomes: it wastes administrative resources and makes it more difficult for donors to overcome collective action problems, leading them to fund their own projects rather than providing budget support, poach capable managers from the <b>recipient’s</b> <b>administration,</b> release funds without adequate checks, and tie aid to purchases from the donor. By contrast, this paper examines the potential benefits from having a multiplicity of donors, drawing on recent theories of “collective wisdom” to argue that the greater diversity of perspectives that larger numbers of donors entail can help select better policies. We hypothesise a U-shaped relationship: countries with a moderate number of donors fare better than countries with either few or many donors.

This adoptive transfer model was used to investigate the contribution of B 7 -CD 28 /CTLA- 4 interactions to the control of intestinal inflammation.

In contrast, anti-CTLA- 4 treatment led to deterioration of disease, to more severe inflammation, and to enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Of note, CD 25 (+) CD 4 (+) cells from CD 28 (-/-) mice similar to those from the wild-type mice were efficient to prevent intestinal mucosal inflammation induced by the wild-type CD 45 RB(high) cells. The inhibitory functions of these regulatory T cells were effectively blocked by anti-CTLA- 4.

The main objective is {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the reality of aid-growth relationship in Vietnam, how and through which channels aid may influence outcomes, and what make aid works better or less well. In the research, growth accounting analysis is conducted to regconize contributions of foreign assistance to production factors. An empirical model is estimated using the Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (ARDL) approach to cointegration for the purpose of evaluating of the direct impact of aid on final economic outcome. Additionally, the study conducts an analysis reviewing both positive and negative effects of foreign aid across different sectors. The empirical results indicate that foreign aid has a significantly positive role in promoting economic growth in Vietnam. The results of growth accounting exercise and the analysis of fundamental channels through which aid has contributed to development outcomes also obtain more evidence supporting the beneficial impacts of aid, especially on macroeconomic management, infrastructure, and human capital accumulation. However, at the same time, such aid-related problems as high volatility and unpredictability of the inflow, absorptive capacity constraints, and rent seeking behavior could burden the <b>recipient's</b> <b>administration</b> and in turn, undermine the aid effectiveness. Based on these findings, a set of policy implications has been suggested. Firstly, Vietnamese government and its donor community should put more effort into improving the coordination among involved parties. Secondly, the analysis implies the importance of systematic evaluations of completed aid programs and projects. Thirdly, the quality of institution and managerial capacity should be strengthened in addition to aid effort. Fourthly, Vietnam needs to be acutely conscious of the problems involving due to high volatility and unpredictability of aid and then implement necessary measures to alleviate pressure on fiscal management.

The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the influence of TMP-SMX prophylaxis on the occurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and urinary tract infections (UTIs) as cystitis and allograft pyelonephritis (AGPN) and its impact on the antimicrobial resistance pattern of causative microorganisms. We have conducted a retrospective before-after study in adult renal allograft recipients with one year follow-up after transplantation. We compared the ("after") group that received TMP-SMX as PJP prophylaxis to the ("before") group that did not receive it. In total, 343 renal allograft recipients were analysed, of whom 212 (61. 8 %) received TMP-SMX as PJP prophylaxis. In this study, 63 (18. 4 %) did only develop ASB without UTI, 26 (7. 6 %) developed cystitis and 43 (12. 5 %) developed AGPN. The remaining 211 (61. 5 %) renal allograft recipients did not develop any bacteriuria at all. Multivariable Cox proportional regression analysis indicated that TMP-SMX as PJP prophylaxis was not associated with reduced prevalence of ASB (Hazard ratio (HR) = 1. 52, 95 % CI = 0. 79 - 2. 94, p = 0. 213), nor with reduced incidence of cystitis (HR = 2. 21, 95 % CI = 0. 76 - 6. 39, p = 0. 144), nor AGPN (HR = 1. 12, 95 % CI = 0. 57 - 2. 21, p = 0. 751).

Lewis neonates on their first day of life underwent i. t., subcutaneous (s. c.), intraperitoneal (i. p.), or intravenous (i. v.) injections of 5 x 10 (7) Golden Syrian hamster splenocytes. After six weeks, the rats underwent heterotopic cardiac transplantation of hamster hearts. Cyclophosphamide (CyP) was administered {{on the day before}} surgery and postoperatively to suppress antibody-mediated graft rejection. Rats given splenocytes with 80 mg/kg of CyP had the following graft survival times: 8 to 12 days for i. t. injection (mean, 9. 4 days); 5 to 7 days for s. c. injection (mean, 6. 6 days); 4 to 11 days for i. p. injection (mean, 7. 4 days); and 4 to 13 days for i. v. injection (mean, 7. 9 days).

Eight of eight rabbits actively immunized and seven of nine rabbits passively immunized with unmodified donor specific IgG alloantibody hyperacutely rejected an allografted kidney. Four rabbits treated with non-specific F(ab') 2 for one week acutely rejected an allografted kidney at a mean of 6. 2 days. In 12 recipient rabbits receiving 100 - 500 mg of donor specific F(ab') 2 alloantibody for a mean of 8. 5 days, onset of uremia was delayed to a mean of 14. 5 days following transplantation.

40|$|Purpose. To {{test the}} effects of clodronate liposomes on graft {{survival}} and neovascularisation after transplantation in pre-vascularised recipient corneas. Methods. Corneal neovascularisation was induced in F 344 rats by injecting heat inactivated rabbit serum intrastromally. After 4 weeks F 344 rats were orthotopically grafted with corneal buttons from DA rats. Directly after transplantation and on 2, 4, 6 and 8 days postoperatively clodronate liposomes were administrated subconjunctivally in one group, whereas the other group remained untreated. For 60 days grafts were observed for signs of graft rejection and neovascularisation. Results. Graft survival was significantly prolonged, but not prevented in clodronate liposome treated rats compared to untreated rats (p =. 004). Also clodronate liposome administration delays growth of corneal neovascularisation after transplantation. Conclusions. Previous studies revealed that clodronate liposomes prevent corneal graft rejection and reduce neovascularisation in orthotopic corneal allotransplantation in rats.

The infusion of high-dose IVIG is generally well tolerated, but {{there are reports of}} hemolytic anemia induced by anti-blood group antibodies present in IVIG. Here, we report our experience with IVIG-induced hemolytic anemia (IH) in ESRD patients receiving IVIG for desensitization or treatment of AMR. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: All patients receiving IVIG for desensitization or for treatment of AMRwere monitored for evidence of acute anemia and hemolysis. Markers of hemolysis, including direct antiglobulin tests, were recorded. Five different IVIG products were tested for isohemagglutinin titers. Results: There were 18 cases of IH in 16 patients. All identified cases received the IVIG product Gamunex, Gammagard liquid, or Privigen. All patients developing hemolysis were non-O blood types. Isohemagglutinin titers ranged from 1 : 2 to 1 : 64 in the various IVIG products, with higher titers noted in the liquid, nonlyophilized products. Conclusions: Acute IH is a significant complication of high-dose IVIG infusion.

40|$|Mice {{were treated}} with 5 -day courses of {{cyclosporin}} A (CsA) {{around the time of}} infection with Schistosoma mansoni. Recovery of lung-stage worms 4 - 8 days post-infection (p. i.) was substantially reduced (80 %) and no sexually mature adults were recovered from the hepatic portal system at 7 weeks p. i. Flow cytometric analysis of spleen cells from CsA-treated animals during the period of maximal parasite attrition revealed transient reductions in CD 3 + and CD 4 + cells and in the CD 4 +: CD 8 + ratio compared with drug vehicle-treated, infected controls. No significant numerical changes in B cells, macrophages or eosinophils were detected relative to vehicle-treated infected mice. Transfer of spleen cells from CsA-treated donors 8 days after infection failed to confer increased resistance to S. mansoni infection on untreated <b>recipients.</b> Moreover, concomitant <b>administration</b> of CsA and an inducer of interleukin- 2 production (ADA- 202 - 718) did not interfere with the anti-schistosomal effect of CsA. Despite our incomplete understanding of the in vivo properties of CsA and reports of its paradoxical effects on immune responses, these new data indicate that the influence of CsA in schistosomiasis is unlikely to be mediated by modulation of host cell mediated immunity. This contrasts with certain other anti-parasitic effects of CsA which appear to be mediated by an action on T cells...|$|R
40|$|Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) {{have strong}} {{immunomodulatory}} properties {{and therefore can}} be used to control inflammation and tissue damage. It was suggested recently that MSC injections {{can be used to}} treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). However, MSC trafficking and immunomodulatory effects of MSC injections during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection have not been studied. To address this issue we have analyzed MSC distribution in tissues and local immunological effects of MSC injections in Mtb infected and uninfected mice. After intravenous injection, MSC accumulated preferentially in the lungs where they were located as cell aggregates in the alveolar walls. Immunological analysis of MSC effects included detection of activated, IFN-γ and IL- 4 producing CD 4 + lymphocytes, the frequency analysis of dendritic cells (CD 11 c+F 4 / 80) and macrophages (CD 11 c-F 4 / 80 +) located in the lungs, the expression of IA/IE and CD 11 b molecules by these cells, and evaluation of 23 cytokines/chemokines in lung lysates. In the lungs of uninfected mice, MSC transfer markedly increased the percentage of IFN-γ+ CD 4 + lymphocytes and dendritic cells, elevated levels of IA/IE expression by dendritic cells and macrophages, augmented local production of type 2 cytokines (IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 10) and chemokines (CCL 2, CCL 3, CCL 4, CCL 5, CXCL 1), and downregulated type 1 and hematopoietic cytokines (IL- 12 p 70, IFN-γ, IL- 3, IL- 6, GM-CSF). Compared to uninfected mice, Mtb infected mice had statistically higher "background" frequency of activated CD 69 + and IFN-γ+ CD 4 + lymphocytes and dendritic cells, and higher levels of cytokines in the lungs. The injections of MSC to Mtb infected mice did not show statistically significant effects on CD 4 + lymphocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages, only slightly shifted cytokine profile, and did not change pathogen load or slow down TB progression. Lung section analysis showed that in Mtb infected mice, MSC could not be found in the proximity of the inflammatory foci. Thus, in healthy <b>recipients,</b> MSC <b>administration</b> dramatically changed T-cell function and cytokine/chemokine milieu in the lungs, most likely, due to capillary blockade. But, during Mtb infection, i. e., in the highly-inflammatory conditions, MSC did not affect T-cell function and the level of inflammation. The findings emphasize the importance of the evaluation of MSC effects locally at the site of their predominant post-injection localization and question MSC usefulness as anti-TB treatment...|$|R
40|$|Lung {{transplantation}} is a recognised {{treatment for}} patients with end stage pulmonary disease. Transplant <b>recipients</b> receive life-long <b>administration</b> of immunosuppressive drugs that target T cell mediated graft rejection. However little is known of the impact on NK cells, which {{have the potential to}} be alloreactive in response to HLA-mismatched ligands on the lung allograft and in doing so, may impact negatively on allograft survival. NK cells from 20 healthy controls were assessed in response to Cyclosporine A, Mycophenolic acid (MPA; active form of Mycophenolate mofetil) and Prednisolone at a range of concentrations. The impact of these clinically used immunosuppressive drugs on cytotoxicity (measured by CD 107 a expression), IFN-c production and CFSE proliferation was assessed in response to various stimuli including MHC class-I negative cell lines, IL- 2 /IL- 12 cytokines and PMA/Ionomycin. Treatment with MPA and Prednisolone revealed significantly reduced CD 107 a expression in response to cell line stimulation. In comparison, addition of MPA and Cyclosporine A displayed reduced CD 107 a expression and IFN-c production following PMA/Ionomycin stimulation. Diminished proliferation was observed in response to treatment with each drug. Additional functional inhibitors (LY 294002, PD 98059, Rottlerin, Rapamycin) were used to elucidate intracellular pathways of NK cell activation in response to stimulation with K 562 or PMA-I. CD 107 a expression was significantly decreased with the addition of PD 98059 following K 562 stimulation.

40|$|AbstractChronic {{graft-versus-host disease}} (cGVHD) is an autoimmune-like syndrome, and donor B cells play {{important}} roles in augmenting its pathogenesis. B cell–depleting anti-CD 20 mAb has been administered before or after cGVHD onset for preventing or treating cGVHD in the clinic. Although administration before onset appeared to be more effective, the effect is variable and sometimes minimal. Here, we used 2 mouse cGVHD models to evaluate the preventive and therapeutic effect of anti-CD 20 mAb. With the model of DBA/ 2 donor to MHC-matched BALB/c recipient, 1 intravenous injection of anti-CD 20 mAb (40  mg/kg) the following day or on day 7 after hematopoietic cell transplantation when serum autoantibodies were undetectable effectively prevented induction of cGVHD and preserved a strong graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. The separation of GVL effect from GVHD {{was associated with a}} significant reduction of donor CD 4 + T cell proliferation and expansion and protection of host thymic medullary epithelial cells. Anti-CD 20 mAb administration also prevented expansion of donor T cells and induction of cGVHD in another mouse model of C 57 BL/ 6 donor to MHC-mismatched BALB/c <b>recipients.</b> In contrast, <b>administration</b> of anti-CD 20 mAb after GVHD onset was not able to effectively deplete donor B cells or ameliorate cGVHD in either model. These results indicate that administration of anti-CD 20 mAb before signs of cGVHD can prevent induction of autoimmune-like cGVHD while preserving a GVL effect; there is little effect if administered after cGVHD onset. This provides new insights into clinical prevention and therapy of cGVHD with B cell–depleting reagents...|$|R
40|$|Coartem has {{recently}} replaced chloroquine as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria due to resistance {{in many regions}} worldwide. This study was aimed to compare the effect of chloroquine and coartem on haematological parameters in rats. Thirty (30) albino Wistar rats were randomly assigned into 2 batches of 15 rats. Each batch was further divided into 3 groups of 5 rats each. Group 1 was control, groups 2 and 3 received coartem (1. 6 mg/ 100 g body weight) and chloroquine (0. 875 mg/ 100 g body weight) orally and once daily. The feeding regimen lasted for 3 and 7 days for batches 1 and 2 respectively. Complete blood count was done using automatic counter. Results revealed that administration of chloroquine and coartem for 3 days did not significantly altered the levels of RBC, Hb, PCV, total & differential WBC, platelet count and platelet indices, but led to significant reductions in MCV and MCH in chloroquine recipient (60. 80 ± 0. 98 fL and 19. 14 ± 0. 31 pg) compared with control (68. 64 ± 2. 12 fL and 20. 80 ± 0. 60 pg; p< 0. 05) and coartem (68. 16 ± 1. 73 fL and 20. 36 ± 0. 14 pg; p< 0. 01) groups respectively. However, administration of these drugs for 7 days caused significant reduction in RBC, Hb and PCV in coartem recipients compared with control (p< 0. 05) and chloroquine (p< 0. 01) groups. RDW was also significantly reduced in chloroquine <b>recipients.</b> In conclusion, <b>administration</b> of coartem and chloroquine at their recommended doses and durations would not pose any deleterious effect on haematological parameters in rats. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{doctoral}} thesis is to analyse some legal, technical and economic aspects, related {{to the development of}} e-Government in the Czech Republic and to draw some general prerequisites for a successful development of e-Government services. The work contains a review of the legislation, which has a direct or indirect impact on the development of e-Government. It concerns mainly the digital signature legislation, public administration information systems, general regulations on administrative procedures and some special regulations. In this thesis there are analysed in detail currently implemented e-Government projects, especially the public administration contact points, the data inboxes, the authorized documents' conversion and the basic registers of public administration. Special attention is also devoted to the questions of personal data security in information systems. Possible effects of e-Government are evaluated with regard to <b>recipients</b> of public <b>administration,</b> particularly to citizens and legal persons. Measurable indicators (metrics) are proposed to measure the progress of individual e-Government projects, along with the procedure of their calculation. This thesis concludes that for reliable measurement of efficiency, it is necessary to identify some quantifiable indicators on the cost side as well as and on the benefits side. These indicators should be oriented to the cost aspect {{as well as to the}} specific objectives of public administration. As for the methodology, in the thesis there are used the usual methods of research in the field of legal science. Concretely used methods are the process analysis, cost analysis and metrics analysis, whose methodology is based primarily on the economics, management and information management. Furthermore, the case studies have been used to fulfil the objectives of the thesis and to verify the thesis' hypotheses...|$|R
40|$|A natriuretic and {{diuretic}} {{response to}} whole blood infusion in the rat, exaggerated and sustained by intravenous reinfusion of excreted urine, {{was shown to}} be associated with increased glomerular filtration and reduced tubular reabsorption. Cross-circulation of animals so responding (donor rats) with isovolemic recipients led to a modest natriuretic and diuretic response in the latter, not accounted for by altered physical composition of the blood nor by observed changes in filtration rate or arterial blood pressure. The recipient natriuresis was unchanged when nephrectomized donors were used and it occurred in experiments in which donor urine was simultaneously replaced by intravenously infused Ringer-Locke solution; the natriuretic property of the cross-circulating blood could therefore not have been due to reinfusion of urinary constituents, nor to accumulation of metabolites, nor to a factor of renal origin. A recipient natriuresis was also observed when the expanded and urine reinfused donor had been acutely adrenalectomized, ruling out an altered secretion of adrenal cortical or medullary hormones as a principal cause of this natriuresis; the data, however, do not exclude participation of reduced aldosterone secretion in the normal effector mechanism. In control experiments in which whole blood was exchanged for donor blood, a small delayed natriuresis did occur in the recipient; this could be completely prevented by administration of aldosterone. In similar exchange experiments with adrenalectomized donors, a small natriuresis developed in the <b>recipient</b> before blood <b>administration</b> but declined afterwards. These minor natriuretic effects probably resulted from altered mineralocorticoid content of the cross-circulating blood due to factors other than blood volume change. The larger natriuretic response seen in all recipients when the donor was volume expanded must have been due largely to a humoral natriuretic factor of other than renal or adrenal origin...|$|R
3000|$|Hydroxyethyl starch, an {{artificial}} polymer, {{is derived from}} amylopectin, which is a highly branched chain of glucose molecules obtained from waxy maize or potatoes. Conservation from degradation and water solubility are achieved by hydroxyethylation of the glucose units. HES solutions are available in several preparations and vary in concentration, molecular weight, molar substitution, C 2 /C 2 ratio, solvent, and pharmacologic profile. Although small HES molecules (< 50 - 60 kD) are eliminated rapidly by glomerular filtration, larger molecules are hydrolyzed to smaller fractions and are partially taken up in the reticuloendothelial system. Although this storage seems not to impair the mononuclear phagocytic system, {{it is remarkable that}} low molecular weight HES accumulates less compared with high molecular weight HES [42]. Negative effects of high molecular HES on the coagulation system are well described. Preparations > 200 kD lead to a reduction of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII, causing a decreased platelet adhesion. Low molecular weight preparations, such as HES 130 / 0.4, have only minimal effects on coagulation. HES in balanced solution increases the expression of activated platelet GP IIb/IIIa, indicating an improved hemostasis [43, 44]. Focusing on kidney function, an 80 % rate of [...] "osmotic nephrosis-like lesions" [...] and impaired renal function were reported in kidney transplant <b>recipients</b> after <b>administration</b> of HES 200 / 0.62 to brain-dead organ donors [45, 46]. In septic patients, usage of 10 % HES 200 / 0.5 correlated with a higher incidence of renal failure compared with crystalloids [47]. Admittedly, HES was administered without regard to exclusion criteria and dose limitations in this study. The most likely pathomechanism of renal impairment by colloids is the induction of urine hyperviscosity by infusing hyperoncotic agents in dehydrated patients. Glomerular filtration of hyperoncotic molecules causes a hyperviscous urine and results in stasis of the tubular flow [48]. Elevated plasma oncotic pressure, regardless of which genesis, is known to cause acute renal failure since more than 20 years [49]. Based on this pathogenesis, all hyperoncotic colloids may induce renal damage, whereas iso-oncotic tetra starch solutions, such as 6 % HES 130 / 0.4, seem not to impair renal function [41, 46]. After administration of extremely high application rates (up to 66 liters in 21 days) in patients with severe head injury, no impairment of renal function was observed [50]. In contrast to results of the VISEP study [47], the SOAP study, which included more than 3, 000 critically ill septic patients treated with pentastarch and tetrastarch solutions, also showed no higher risk for renal failure [51]. Hydroxyethyl starch was administered in much lower amounts (13 vs. 70 ml/kg) and for a shorter period in the SOAP study. There is evidence that HES also modulates inflammation. Synthetic colloids inhibit neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium and neutrophil infiltration of the lung [52, 53].|$|R
40|$|Background: Immunogenicity of {{standard}} infl uenza vaccine is suboptimal in lung transplant recipients. Intradermal vaccine may elicit stronger responses due to recruitment of local dendritic cells. We compared the immunogenicity of the infl uenza vaccine administered intradermally (ID) {{to the standard}} intramuscular (IM) vaccination. Methods: In this investigator-blinded, two-center, prospective trial, lung transplant patients were randomized to receive intradermal (6 ug) or intramuscular (15 ug) 2008 / 9 trivalent inactivated infl uenza vaccine. Immunogenicity was evaluated using a standard hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA). Response to the vaccine was defi ned as a fourfold increase of the HIA levels {{for any of the}} 3 viral strains in the vaccine. Geometric mean titers (GMT) and seroprotection rate (HIA ≥ 32) were also analyzed. Patients were followed during 6 months for the development of infl uenza or acute rejection. Results: We randomized 84 patients to receive the ID (n= 41) vs. IM (n= 43) vaccine, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Median time from transplantation was 3. 4 yrs (ID) vs. 3. 3 yrs (IM) (p= 0. 84). Vaccine response to at least one antigen was seen in 6 / 41 (14. 6 %) patients in the ID vs. 8 / 43 (18. 6 %) in the IM group (p= 0. 77). In the ID group, GMTs (95 % CI) after vaccination were 15. 7 (11. 1 - 22. 3) for H 1 N 1, 84. 0 (52. 0 - 135. 7) for H 3 N 2, and 14. 5 (9. 6 - 21. 8) for B strains vs. in the IM group 17. 5 (11. 8 - 25. 9) for H 1 N 1, 108. 9 (77. 5 - 153. 2) for H 3 N 2, and 20. 2 (12. 8 - 31. 9) for B (p=NS, all 3 strains). Seroprotection was 39 % (H 1 N 1), 82. 9 % (H 3 N 2) and 29. 3 % (B strain) in the ID group vs. 27. 9 % (H 1 N 1), 97. 7 % (H 3 N 2) and 58. 1 % (B strain) in the IM group. No factors associated with vaccine response were identifi ed. Mild adverse events were seen in 44 % of patients (ID) vs. 34 % (IM) (p= 0. 38). Two patients (4. 8 %) in the ID group developed infl uenza infection compared to none in the IM group. Two patients in each group developed biopsy-proven acute rejection during follow-up. Conclusions: Immunogenicity of the 2008 / 09 infl uenza vaccine was poor in lung transplant <b>recipients.</b> ID <b>administration</b> of the vaccine elicited similar immune responses to standard IM vaccination.

40|$|Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the morpholinoethyl ester of {{mycophenolic acid}} (MPA), is {{currently}} {{used as an}} immunosuppressive agent in kidney transplant <b>recipients.</b> After oral <b>administration,</b> MMF is hydrolysed to MPA, the active compound, which is a potent inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMP-DH), Inhibition of this enzyme results in a depletion of the intracellular GTP and dGTP pools.

To examine whether MPA also has an inhibitory effect on HBV replication, experiments were performed using cultures of primary human hepatocytes and HBV-transfected, HepG 2 2. 2. 15 cells. After in vitro infection with HBV in human hepatocytes, HBV covalently-closed-circular (ccc) DNA and HBV mRNAs were detectable in the cells during the 10 days following infection, HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were also secreted into the culture medium. In the presence of 10 mu g ml(- 1) MPA (the therapeutic serum level of MPA as an immunosuppressive agent) in culture medium, HBV ccc DNA and HBV mRNAs became undetectable 5 days after treatment was started. The secretion of HBV DNA and HBsAg into the medium was also markedly reduced, No cytotoxic effect of the drug was noted during the experiments. The effect of MPA on HBV replication was abolished by the presence of guanosine (50 mu g ml(- 1)). In HepG 2 2. 2. 15 cells (which contain an integrated tandem dimer of the HBV genome), MPA treatment had no significant inhibitory effect on the secretion of HBV DNA and HBsAg into the culture medium. HBV ccc DNA and HBV mRNAs in HepG 2 2. 2. 15 cells were also not affected. The observed effect of MPA on HBV replication in primary human hepatocyte cultures may involve only episomal replication and may have clinical implications, especially before integration of HBV DNA into the host genome. status: publishe...|$|R
