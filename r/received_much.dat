5|$|One Hot Minute was a {{commercial}} disappointment despite producing three hit singles and reaching number four on the Billboard 200 chart. It sold {{fewer than half}} as many copies as Blood Sugar Sex Magik and <b>received</b> <b>much</b> less critical acclaim. Navarro was ultimately fired from the band in 1998 due to creative differences.|$|E

5|$|The {{disaster}} received nationwide {{coverage in}} the days following, sharing headlines with Charles Lindbergh's trans-Atlantic crossing (though Lindbergh's crossing <b>received</b> <b>much</b> more attention) and eliciting a national outpouring of grief. Newspaper headlines from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles characterized Kehoe as a maniac, madman, and fiend.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in Brisbane for the Commonwealth Games, Brooks {{and some}} of his fellow sprinters shaved their heads, {{something}} that <b>received</b> <b>much</b> attention from the Australian public. He won his heat of the 100m freestyle in a Commonwealth and Commonwealth Games record of 51.09s. He swam slower in the final, but his time of 51.14s was enough to secure the gold medal in a close contest. Just 0.43s separated him and the bronze and silver medallists Greg Fasala and Michael Delany, both of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} threat of strong {{thunderstorms}} and gusts, Florida was spared {{a direct hit}} from Nicole. The storm skirted the state with only showers; 12.71inches (323mm) of rain were recorded at North Key Largo, though the mainland <b>received</b> <b>much</b> smaller quantities. The storm flooded streets in Miami Beach and the northern Florida Keys, {{as well as one}} home. Similarly, inclement weather spread over the northwestern Bahamas without significant consequences.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's speech <b>received</b> <b>much</b> less {{attention}} than his (now famous) remarks in Indianapolis and was largely forgotten {{by the news}} media.

50|$|While the town's {{reaction}} was initially negative to hosting such a rehabilitation {{program and the}} program was <b>received</b> with <b>much</b> suspicion, the Centre has formed a strong partnership with local government and <b>receives</b> <b>much</b> support and appreciation from the community.|$|R

5|$|LTP has <b>received</b> <b>much</b> {{attention}} {{among those}} who study Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that causes marked cognitive decline and dementia. Much of this deterioration occurs in association with degenerative changes in the hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe structures. Because of the hippocampus' well established role in LTP, {{some have suggested that}} the cognitive decline seen in individuals with AD may result from impaired LTP.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's troubled {{private life}} <b>received</b> <b>much</b> attention. She {{struggled}} with substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to retired baseball star Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, {{both of which}} ended in divorce. On August 5, 1962, she died at age 36 from an overdose of barbiturates {{at her home in}} Los Angeles. Although Monroe's death was ruled a probable suicide, several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death.|$|E

The Balti, a type of curry, was invented in the city, which has <b>received</b> <b>much</b> acclaim for the 'Balti Belt' or 'Balti Triangle'. Famous food brands that originated in Birmingham include Typhoo tea, Bird's Custard, Cadbury's chocolate and HP Sauce.|$|E
5|$|The bunker complex was self-contained. However, as the Führerbunker {{was below}} the water table, {{conditions}} were unpleasantly damp, with pumps running continuously to remove groundwater. A diesel generator provided electricity, and well water was pumped {{in as the}} water supply. Communications systems included a telex, a telephone switchboard, and an army radio set with an outdoor antenna. As conditions deteriorated {{at the end of}} the war, Hitler <b>received</b> <b>much</b> of his war news from BBC radio broadcasts and via courier.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{was built}} by Laing Construction {{at a cost of}} £112 million and was {{designed}} and engineered by ArupSport, whose design incorporated a cable-stayed roof structure, suspended by twelve exterior masts and attached cables.

5|$|Bruce led the Australian {{delegation}} to the 1932 Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa. He redoubled his efforts to improve Australian economic prospects with the empire, and the conference agreed to a limited form of his long-sought imperial preference scheme that would give Australia greater access and competitiveness in imperial markets over five years, an achievement for which Bruce <b>received</b> <b>much</b> praise from the Lyons government. The closer trading arrangements of the Ottawa Agreements would set the pattern for Australian-British trade relations until Britain's entry in the European Common Market in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 1909, Stanley {{attached}} {{his proposed}} {{repeal of the}} tobacco tax as a rider to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act. The bill passed the House, but the Senate stripped Stanley's provision. Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced the repeal into the Senate version of the bill, and it survived when the bill was passed into law. The repeal resulted in higher tobacco prices, and although Stanley had not been alone in getting the repeal passed, he <b>received</b> <b>much</b> of the credit. In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American Tobacco Company bore fruit, as the Supreme Court ruled the company to be in violation of antitrust laws and broke it into separate companies. Both the tax repeal and the breakup of American Tobacco helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{was the son}} of Edward of Wells and {{elder brother}} of Jocelin of Wells, Bishop of Bath. Hugh's year of birth is unknown, but he was {{probably}} an old man at his death in 1235. The fact that he never left his residence from March 1233 until his death implies that he was impaired from old age. He first appears as a witness on documents of Reginald fitzJocelin, the Bishop of Bath in the late 1180s. After fitzJocelin's death in 1191, Hugh continued {{in the service of the}} next bishop, Savaric FitzGeldewin. By the end of the 1190s, Hugh was a canon of Wells Cathedral. Although Hugh's brother Jocelin was given the title of magister, implying that he attended a university, Hugh is never called magister, making it unlikely that he ever <b>received</b> <b>much</b> schooling.|$|E
