50|$|A Relay Access Point (AP) is {{an entity}} that logically {{consists}} of a Relay and a networking station (STA), or client. The <b>relay</b> <b>function</b> allows an AP and stations to exchange frames with one another by {{the way of a}} relay. The introduction of a relay allows stations to use higher MCSs (Modulation and Coding Schemes) and reduce the time stations will stay in Active mode. This improves battery life of stations. Relay stations may also provide connectivity for stations located outside the coverage of the AP. There is an overhead cost on overall network efficiency and increased complexity with the use of relay stations. To limit this overhead, the relaying function shall be bi-directional and limited to two hops only.|$|E

The cut-set upper bound and the rates achievable using decode-and-forward (DF), partial DF and compress-and-forward (CF) relaying are first evaluated. Then relaying strategies with finite memory-length are considered. An efficient algorithm for optimizing the <b>relay</b> <b>functions</b> is presented. The Boolean Fourier transform is then employed to unveil {{the structure of}} the optimized mappings. Interestingly, the optimized <b>relay</b> <b>functions</b> exhibit a simple structure. Numerical results illustrate that the rates achieved using the optimized low-dimensional functions are either comparable to those achieved by CF or superior to those achieved by DF relaying. In particular, the optimized low-dimensional relaying scheme can improve on DF relaying when the quality of the source-relay link is worse than or comparable to that of other links...|$|R

The AC signal is then sampled by the relay's {{analog to digital converter}} from 4 to 64 (varies by relay) samples per power system cycle. As a minimum, magnitude of the incoming quantity, commonly using Fourier transform concepts (RMS and some form of averaging) would be used in a simple <b>relay</b> <b>function.</b> More advanced analysis can be used to determine phase angles, power, reactive power, impedance, waveform distortion, and other complex quantities.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} cooperative spectrum sensing when two secondary users (SUs) collaborate via the relaying scheme. We investigate two cooperative sensing strategies, i. e., SUs exchange data information locally, and SUs relay {{information to a}} central controller. The relaying scheme at each SU is optimized via functional analysis with either the average or peak power constraints. For the local cooperative sensing strategy, the optimal relaying schemes look like amplify-and-forward (AF) in the low-signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) region and behave like decode-and-forward (DF) in the high-SNR region. The fundamental performance limit using local cooperative sensing is discussed. For the global cooperative sensing strategy, we propose both coherent and noncoherent sensing, depending on whether SUs are synchronized. In the coherent case, a decentralized approach is designed, and each SU optimizes its <b>relaying</b> <b>function</b> locally. In the noncoherent case, we use linear energy combination detector to decouple the <b>relaying</b> <b>function</b> from weight coefficient optimization.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{generalized}} analog net-work coding (GANC) scheme for a non-orthogonal multiple-access relay channel (MARC), where two sources transmit their informa-tion simultaneously to the destination {{with the help}} of a relay. In the GANC scheme, the relay receives interfered signals from the two sources and generates signals to be transmitted with a <b>relay</b> <b>function.</b> We focus on the design of the optimal <b>relay</b> <b>function</b> to achieve the minimum pair-wise error probability (PEP) of the system. Specifically, we first covert the <b>relay</b> <b>function</b> optimization problem to a transformation matrix (TM) design problem by pre-senting the received complex signals as signal matrices composed of real and imaginary parts. Then, we propose an optimization criteria, i. e., maximizing the minimal squared Euclidean distance (MMSED), to improve the PEP performance, since the PEP is de-termined by the Euclidean distance of the received constellation at destination. Next, we prove that the MMSED can be equivalently converted to a convex problem by introducing an intermediate matrix. We solve this convex problem by using the Lagrangian method and obtain the closed-form expression of the optimal TM. We further improve the PEP performance by optimizing transmission power of the two sources. Simulation results show that the proposed GANC scheme has a better PEP performance compared to other alternative schemes.

40|$|IPv 4 アドレスの枯渇問題の軽減策の 1 つとして，NAT（Network Address Translation）がある．NATは複数の内部ホストが 1 つのグローバルIPアドレスを共用できるため，必要なグローバルIPアドレスの数を節約できる．しかし，外部ネットワーク側では個々の内部ホストを識別できないため，たとえば外部ネットワーク側でアクセス制御を行うと， 1 台の内部ホストが外部ネットワークに対するアクセス許可を受けただけで他の内部ホストまで外部ネットワークにアクセス可能な状態になるなどの問題が生じる．そこで，本論文ではデータリンク層での送信元識別子である送信元MACアドレスが基本的にはレイヤ 2 機器のMACアドレス学習機能にしか使われていない点に着目し，内部ホストから送信されたフレームに含まれる送信元MACアドレスをそのまま外部ネットワーク側に中継する機能を持つNATルータを提案する．本提案に基づいて試作したNATルータを評価した結果，MACアドレスに基づいて内部ホストを個別にアクセス制御でき，また十分なスループットが得られることを確認した．As an {{alleviation}} method against IPv 4 address exhaustion problem, NAT (Network Address Translation) {{has been}} commonly used. Since NAT allows many internal hosts to share one single global IP address, it {{can save the}} number of required global IP addresses. However, with NAT, each internal host cannot be identified from the external network. Consequently, if access control system on external network would permit network access from one internal host, it automatically would permit all network access from any other internal hosts as well, for example. In this paper, we propose a NAT router with MAC address <b>relaying</b> <b>function</b> that copies the source MAC address of receiving frames sent by internal hosts into frames sent to the external network since source MAC addresses, which are the sender identifiers in data link layer, are basically unused except for MAC address learning function of layer 2 switches.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general stochastic model developed {{for a class}} of cooperative wireless relay networks, in which imperfect knowledge of the channel state information at the destination node is assumed. The framework incorporates multiple relay nodes operating under general known non-linear processing functions. When a non-linear <b>relay</b> <b>function</b> is considered, the likelihood function is generally intractable resulting in the maximum likelihood and the maximum a posteriori detectors not admitting closed form solutions. We illustrate our methodology to overcome this intractability under {{the example of a}} popular optimal non-linear <b>relay</b> <b>function</b> choice and demonstrate how our algorithms are capable of solving the previously intractable detection problem. Overcoming this intractability involves development of specialised Bayesian models. We develop three novel algorithms to perform detection for this Bayesian model, these include a Markov chain Monte Carlo Approximate Bayesian Computation (MCMC-ABC) approach; an Auxiliary Variable MCMC (MCMC-AV) approach; and a Suboptimal Exhaustive Search Zero Forcing (SES-ZF) approach. Finally, numerical examples comparing the symbol error rate (SER) performance versus signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the three detection algorithms are studied in simulated examples...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In a relay network, {{the signal}} {{processing}} at the relay significantly affects the capacity benefits of cooperation. In this work, we explore the optimal relay functionality for capacity maximization in a memoryless relay network, i. e. a network where, during each channel use, the signal transmitted by a relay depends {{only on the}} last received symbol at that relay. By relating some of the existing memoryless forwarding strategies to the fundamental signal processing operations of estimation and detection, we develop a new scheme that forwards the unconstrained {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) estimate obtained at the relay to the destination. For a single relay system, we derive the characterization of the optimal <b>relay</b> <b>function</b> and show that the <b>relay</b> <b>function</b> of EF (estimate and forward) satisfies the optimality condition. For the multiple relay case, we consider both parallel and serial relay networks and show that EF performs better than both AF (amplify and forward) and DF (demodulate and forward). For hybrid networks that contain both serial and parallel elements, and when robust performance is desired at all SNR, the advantage of EF over the best of AF and DF is found to be significant.
