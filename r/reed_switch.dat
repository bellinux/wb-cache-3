25|$|A <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> is an {{electrical}} switch {{consisting of two}} ferromagnetic and specially shaped contact blades (reeds) positioned in a hermetically sealed glass tube with a gap between them and in a protective atmosphere. Operated by an applied magnetic field, reed switches are used as reed relays, automotive sensors, robotics sensors, security sensors and are found in many toys and games. The <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> was invented in 1936 by W. B. Elwood at Bell Telephone Laboratories.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{contacts}} of the <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> are sealed {{away from the}} atmosphere, they are protected against atmospheric corrosion. The hermetic sealing of a <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> make them suitable for use in explosive atmospheres where tiny sparks from conventional switches would constitute a hazard.|$|E

50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> use a matched seal {{between an}} iron-nickel alloy (NiFe 52) and a matched glass. The glass of <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> is usually green {{due to its}} iron content because the sealing of <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> is done by heating with {{infrared}} radiation and this glass shows a high absorption in the near infrared.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> {{are filled}} with {{nitrogen}} at atmospheric pressure. After the final seal is made, the switch cools and the internal pressure is less than one atmosphere. <b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> sealed with a pressurized nitrogen atmosphere have a higher breakdown voltage and are useful for switching 220-240 VAC power. <b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> with a vacuum atmosphere can switch thousands of volts.|$|R
50|$|A {{reed relay}} (sometimes {{also known as}} Herkon relay) {{is a type of}} relay that uses an {{electromagnet}} to control one or more <b>reed</b> <b>switches.</b> The contacts are of magnetic material and the electromagnet acts directly on them without requiring an armature to move them. Sealed in a long, narrow glass tube, the contacts are protected from corrosion, and are usually plated with silver, which has very low resistivity but is prone to corrosion when exposed, rather than corrosion-resistant but more resistive gold as used in the exposed contacts of high quality relays. The glass envelope may contain multiple <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> or multiple <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> can be inserted into a single bobbin and actuate simultaneously. <b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> have been manufactured since the 1930s.|$|R

50|$|The {{hermetically}} sealed <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> {{is a very}} common type of two piece sensor that operates with an electrically conductive <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> that is either normally open or normally closed when {{under the influence of}} a magnetic field {{as in the case of}} proximity to the second piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved away from the <b>reed</b> <b>switch,</b> the <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> either closes or opens, again based on whether or not the design is normally open or normally closed. This action coupled with an electric current (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit. These type of sensors are very common and are found either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.|$|E
40|$|Electroplated {{coatings}} for <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> {{were developed}} and investigated. The optimal compositions of industrial electrolytes currently {{used in the}} mass production of <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> were given.

It has been found that the formation of surface nitride layers enhances corrosion and erosion resistance of contacts. We proposed to produce such layers directly into sealed <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> by means of pulsing glow-discharge nitrogen plasma...|$|R

5000|$|One type of {{float switch}} uses a mercury switch inside a hinged float. Another common type is a float that raises a rod to actuates a microswitch. One pattern uses a <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> mounted in a tube; a float, {{containing}} a magnet, surrounds {{the tube and}} is guided by it. When the float raises the magnet to the <b>reed</b> <b>switch,</b> it closes. Several reeds can be mounted in the tube for different level indications by one assembly.|$|E

50|$|The <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> {{contains}} a pair (or more) of magnetizable, flexible, metal reeds whose end portions {{are separated by}} a small gap when the switch is open. The reeds are hermetically sealed in opposite ends of a tubular glass envelope.|$|E
50|$|The <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> (sometimes {{also known}} as Herkon) is an {{electrical}} switch operated by an applied magnetic field. It was invented at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1936 by W. B. Ellwood. It consists {{of a pair of}} contacts on ferromagnetic metal reeds in a hermetically sealed glass envelope. The contacts may be normally open, closing when a magnetic field is present, or normally closed and opening when a magnetic field is applied. The switch may be actuated by a coil, making a reed relay, or by bringing a magnet near to the switch. Once the magnet is pulled away from the switch, the <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> will go back to its original position.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> {{are used}} {{in at least one}} brand of pillcam to switch on the power source only when the unit is removed from the sterile packaging.|$|R
40|$|A {{frequency}} reconfigurable {{patch antenna}} using <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> {{to connect the}} patch with the ground plane is proposed. Compared with other voltage-controlled switches like MEMS and PIN diodes, <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> are controlled by a magnetic field which can penetrate the ground plane easily. In this way, the control circuit can be placed beneath the ground plane to avoid its impacts on the radiation performance of the antenna. Twenty-four <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> are used to increase the reconfigurability of the antenna and to show the feasibility of our concept when multiple control circuits are used simultaneously. The presented antenna can be reconfigured {{to operate in the}} frequency range from 0. 3 to 3 GHz, covering for a large number of communication services. Three operating modes of the antenna (with resonance frequencies at 0. 8, 2, and 2. 85 GHz, respectively) are presented to illustrate the feasibility of this method. The measured matching and radiation characteristics of the fabricated antenna prototype agree well with the simulations...|$|R
50|$|Other early interrupters {{worked by}} {{clockwork}} mechanisms or (non-magnetic) <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> operated by {{motion of the}} patient's limbs. One {{example of such a}} device is found in the Pulvermacher chain.|$|R
50|$|A problem exists {{with the}} {{hibernation}} sensor located in some older laptops. Unlike many laptops that use a mechanical switch to detect when the lid is closed, in these systems the sensor is a magnetic <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> that is located between the touchpad {{and the front}} edge of the laptop. There is a magnet that is located in the top lid above this switch, and when the lid is closed the magnet triggers the <b>reed</b> <b>switch.</b> If the magnet loses strength then the system will not go into suspend or hibernation if the lid is closed. The magnet strength can be checked by running a paper clip along the top edge of the screen. A worse problem happens if the <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> fails. Sometimes the switches will fail in a closed position with the contacts sticking together. In that case the system will not switch on. There are several ways to check for this. First the laptop can be partially disassembled and the mouse assembly can be unplugged from the system board and the system switched on. If the system boots with the mouse unplugged then it is the switch. Another way to check for the problem is by running a magnet over the <b>reed</b> <b>switch,</b> there should be a faint click when the magnet triggers the switch. This does not require disassembly but the magnet must be in the correct position and be strong enough. Some people have modified the circuitry of the laptop by cutting the switch off of the assembly, with the downside being the system will no longer suspend if the lid is closed.|$|E
50|$|In some {{automated}} systems, {{the central}} unit {{needs to know}} when trains reach their destination or a certain point. This information is detected by a sensor, such as an infrared device placed between the tracks, a <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> or a device which senses current draw in an isolated section of track.|$|E
50|$|A {{computerized}} driver system reads data, typically characters, {{and flips}} the appropriate discs {{to produce the}} desired display. Some displays use {{the other end of}} the solenoid to actuate a <b>reed</b> <b>switch,</b> which controls an LED array behind the disc, resulting in a display that is visible at night but requires no extra drive electronics.|$|E
5000|$|Inside the 1ESS {{switch matrix}} switch and certain other high-reliability designs, the <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> are always {{switched}} [...] "dry" [...] {{to avoid that}} problem, leading to much longer contact life.|$|R
50|$|Glass-to-metal seals {{are a very}} {{important}} element {{of the construction of}} vacuum tubes, electric discharge tubes, incandescent light bulbs, glass encapsulated semiconductor diodes, <b>reed</b> <b>switches,</b> pressure tight glass windows in metal cases, and metal or ceramic packages of electronic components.|$|R
50|$|At {{one time}} {{brushless}} DC electric motors used <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> {{to sense the}} rotor's position relative to the field poles. This allows switching transistors {{to act as a}} commutator, but without the contact problems, wear and electrical noise of a traditional DC commutator. The motor design could also be 'inverted', placing permanent magnets onto the rotor and switching the field through the external, fixed coils. This avoided the need for any rubbing contact to provide power to the rotor. Such motors were used in low-power long-service-life items such as computer cooling fans and disk drives. As cheap Hall effect sensors became available, they replaced the <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> and gave longer service lifetimes.|$|R
50|$|A {{reed relay}} is a <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> {{enclosed}} in a solenoid. The switch has {{a set of}} contacts inside an evacuated or inert gas-filled glass tube which protects the contacts against atmospheric corrosion; the contacts are made of magnetic material that makes them move {{under the influence of}} the field of the enclosing solenoid or an external magnet.|$|E
50|$|The <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> {{principle}} can {{be applied}} to directly switch a variety of loads ranging from nanovolts to kilovolts, femtoamperes to amperes, and DC to radio frequency. Other magnetic sensing devices have a limited range of output voltages and currents, and generally do not directly control a final device such as a lamp, solenoid, or motor.|$|E
5000|$|A {{magnetic}} field (from an electromagnet or a permanent magnet) {{will cause the}} reeds to attract each other, thus completing an electrical circuit. The spring force of the reeds causes them to separate, and open the circuit, when the {{magnetic field}} ceases. Another configuration contains a non-ferromagnetic normally-closed contact that opens when the ferromagnetic normally-open contact closes. A thin layer of non-ferromagnetic material {{is applied to the}} <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> contact area to serve as an electrical contact switching (wear) surface and, for normally-open contacts, as a magnetic spacer whose thickness is important in controlling the magnetic field level at which the contact opens (the drop-out). <b>Reed</b> <b>switch</b> contacts are typically Rh, Ru, Ir, or W. There are also versions of reed switches with mercury [...] "wetted" [...] contacts. Such switches must be mounted in a particular orientation. Otherwise drops of mercury may bridge the contacts even when not activated.|$|E
5000|$|Glass <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> use a thin metal [...] "reed" [...] that bends when {{a magnet}} is brought near it; since the entire unit is sealed {{in a glass}} tube, this helps protect the switch from {{moisture}} and dust that can damage regular switches.|$|R
50|$|An {{interesting}} fact is {{that the}} hardware contained about 3 to 4 grams of gold and almost 18 grams of silver. The letters on the keyboard was written using cool laser beam technology. The buttons didn't use copper or iron contact plates, but <b>Reed</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{crank sensor}} {{is used on}} {{bicycles}} to monitor {{the position of the}} crankset, usually for the cadence readout of a cyclocomputer. These are usually <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> mounted on the bicycle frame with a corresponding magnet attached to one of the pedal crankset arms.|$|R
