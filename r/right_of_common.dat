Following a public enquiry, in January 2012 Top Field was de-registered as common land, whilst however reaffirming the ownership of the land by the CCT.|$|E
25|$|In 1868, the sawmill and dam {{were sold}} to William Richards. The Richards family would be owners and {{operators}} for the following 89 years. In 1911, a pollution-based lawsuit was brought against the sawmill, {{in the court of}} judge Latchford, Pembroke and Ottawa. This lawsuit {{was one of the first}} pollution-based lawsuits in the Province of Ontario. William Hunter, plaintiff and owner of the local gristmill, complained that between 1904 and 1909, sawdust from the upstream sawmill was negatively affecting his gristmill operations, that Constant Creek was being fouled by the usage of the sawmill, that the flow of water in Constant Creek was impeded, that the defendant disposed of refuse in the creek and that, otherwise, the plaintiff suffered injury as a result. Hunter further complained that the pollution caused damage to his mill pond and that he could not properly run his gristmill, as a result. Richards, the defendant, claimed that he was within his rights based on three reasons: (1) by virtue of a grant from the Crown, (2) <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> law and (3) by easement rights under the Limitations Act.|$|E

50|$|The {{subdivision}} of commonable properties {{from the}} end of the 19th century onwards increased significantly the numbers of Forest commoners. However, this increase was accompanied by a sharp decline in commoners' exploitation <b>of</b> their <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> on the Forest, which became most marked after World War II. Those commoners who operated smallholdings around the Forest found that they were increasingly unable to compete with cheaper agricultural produce from elsewhere. Many decided to give up their onerous work and moved to jobs in nearby towns and cities or else retired, in some cases selling up to commuters looking for an attractive country retreat. In 1965, more than half the 1,300 Forest commoners, perhaps deterred by the bureaucratic process involved or apathetic, failed to register under the Commons Registration Act, losing forever the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> that were attached to their land. Today, about 730 properties in and around Ashdown Forest retain commonable rights, but very few owners exercise the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> attached to them. While most commoners live on or close to the Forest, in villages and hamlets or on smallholdings and isolated properties, some reside much further away.|$|R

50|$|Evidence of the {{inadequacy}} of the settlement for the poorest residents comes from the legal challenge they made in 1630 to express dissatisfaction with the proceedings. Only 30 of the 184 complainants were entitled to compensation. The others were tenants on lands cleared without permission or subtenants who had no <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>common.</b> These residents were the main obstacle to reaching agreement on disafforestation. The area lacked important industries, so large numbers of cottagers had settled in the forest and survived by using the common.|$|E

By s. 3 (ii.) of the Settled Land Act 1882, the tenant for life of a manor is empowered to sell the seignory of any freehold land within the manor, and by s. 21 (v.) the purchase of the seignory of any part of settled land being freehold land, is an authorized application of capital money arising under the act.|$|E

The original site was not large enough however, and Robert, son of Hugh, found a better site {{a short distance away}} in 1187. The 1187 date is probably completion of the Abbey, as the architecture dates it to around 1175.

The premises stand removed {{a short distance from}} the road with fore court; excellent pasture and kitchen gardens fully planted with fruit tress; and well cropped orchard and paddock; with comfortable cottage nearby adjoining; with coach house, stabling and lofts and various outbuildings, tack years etc.; well supplied with fine water comprising in the whole five acres with <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>common.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1809 an Act {{was finally}} {{obtained}} ordering the enclosure of Gateshead Fell. Enclosure {{was completed in}} 1822. Commissioners were appointed to settle claims in land and to apportion the Fell accordingly. The commissioners were empowered to set out such parts as they pleased for roads, drains, quarries, watering places, and one acre as a church-yard: of the residue, one-sixteenth part was appropriated to the bishop of Durham as lord of the manor, and another sixteenth part to the boroughholders and freemen of Gateshead, in compensation for their exclusive right of letting stints: {{the rest of the}} Fell (except a part for making two waggon-ways) was divided amongst persons having <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>common.</b> The whole Fell contained 631 acres, 0 roods, 21 poles, exclusive of roads, quarries and wells.|$|E
50|$|Though {{historically}} {{part of a}} royal forest, {{the nature}} of the area encouraged people to turn out cattle and other animals to graze upon this unenclosed land. This practice was eventually recognised and granted as the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> pasture. Certain landowners and occupiers still have this right, granted them as part of the Epping Forest Act 1878, and cattle grazed freely until 1996 when the BSE crisis forced their removal. It is probable that continued grazing on this and similar areas of the Forest helped to maintain the open aspect which they have today. Although the campaign to prevent enclosure before 1878 is well known, less well known is the campaign organised by local people to prevent the building of houses for 7000 people on part of Wanstead Flats in 1946/47.|$|E
50|$|Williams's {{lectures on}} the Seisin of the Freehold, the Law of Settlements, and the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Common</b> were {{published}} in 1878-1880.

5000|$|It {{should be}} {{highlighted}} that the commoners, historically, {{were not necessarily}} [...] "common" [...] people; they were simply people whose landholdings had <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> on the Forest attached to them. In practice they ranged from lowly tenants or landowners running small, subsistence farm-holdings scraping a living off the forest to major local landowners of high social standing. So, for example, in the 19th century the main protagonist {{on behalf of the}} commoners in the celebrated legal dispute between the commoners and the Lord of the Manor, the seventh Earl de la Warr, about their <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> on the Forest was Bernard Hale, a barrister and Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex, while the other commoners backing him included Sir Percy Maryon-Wilson Bart., the Duke of Norfolk, the 3rd Earl of Sheffield, Lady Shelley and the 3rd Baron Colchester of Kidbrooke Park.|$|R
5000|$|Covenants {{are also}} {{separate}} to public rights. These include <b>rights</b> acquired as <b>of</b> custom [...] - [...] one being, for example, {{the right to}} hold a market in a particular location [...] - [...] thus acting {{in a similar way}} to an easement. However, in order to show a <b>right</b> as <b>of</b> custom it must be shown that the use dates back to at least 1189 and so these are rare. More <b>common</b> are <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>common.</b> These are now regulated by the Commons Act 2006 which laid down a system of exclusive registration [...] - [...] all rights must now be registered if they are to operate. Thus new <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> can only take effect by express grant. <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> way often form the subject of easements, but public <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> way take effect without the need for a covenant. As well as the public highway, rights over common land and open country are also granted to the public, now regulated by the Countryside and <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Way Act 2000.|$|R
