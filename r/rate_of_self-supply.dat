The results show that China can ensure a stable grain market development under more liberalized internal and external conditions. Transmission of the world market prices as projected by the World Bank (2003) to the Chinese domestic market {{would lead to a}} long-run recovery of the growth in grain production. Total production of paddy rice, wheat and maize is forecast to increase from 386 million tons in the base period 2002 to over 420 million tons in 2010. However, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> grain <b>self-supply</b> will be 91 % due to higher demand. This may be significantly lower than the target of the Chinese government. The corresponding deficit would amount to about 35 million tons, to be compared with 38. 5 million tons in 2002 when China had huge grain stocks available. Three fifths of the grain deficit is wheat. China would also become a net importer of maize. The regional results indicate an increasing grain deficit in East and South China. Northeast and North China will achieve higher production growth mainly due to a rapid increase in maize production. The Central South will be able to increase production faster than consumption. The Southwest and Northwest will maintain their current deficit. Finally, some implications for future Chinese grain policies are discussed.

5000|$|The short {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>self-supply</b> is: [...] "People improving {{water and}} sanitation services by themselves". The basic idea <b>of</b> <b>self-supply</b> {{is that people are}} providing water for themselves through their own means without direct government support. Humans have been improving their own access to {{water and sanitation}} without government aid for millennia. [...] As an approach to improving access it is a user-centered approach that involves incrementally improving current service levels, most of the time mainly financed by the end users. Generally this means that the improvements to water supply and sanitation are achieved either through labor by the end-users or by the end-users paying a technician or a company to complete the work. The incentives and benefits for the end users to improve their own water and sanitation services privately may include: convenience, proximity to home, larger volume of water, faster services than municipal water systems, cheaper than municipal water systems, lack of municipal water systems, privacy, security, and reliability.|$|R

A side effect <b>of</b> <b>self-supply</b> <b>of</b> energy is that the corporate demand for electricity in some {{regions of the country}} has decreased significantly. While private generation temporarily eases the pressures on the overall capacity for the sector, it also prevents the realization of economies of scale at a system level. Self-provision of energy appears more costly to companies (up to US$0.38 per KWh) than regional and even local tariffs (around US$0.22 and US$0.25 respectively on average).|$|R
50|$|Household water {{treatment}} and safe storage ensure drinking water is safe for consumption. These interventions {{are part of}} the approach <b>of</b> <b>self-supply</b> <b>of</b> water for households. Drinking water quality remains a significant problem, not only in developing countries but also in developed countries; even in the European region it is estimated that 120 million people {{do not have access to}} safe drinking water. Point-of-use water quality interventions can reduce diarrheal disease in communities where water quality is poor, or in emergency situations where there is a breakdown in water supply.Since water can become contaminated during storage at home (e.g. by contact with contaminated hands or using dirty storage vessels), safe storage of water in the home is also important.|$|R
50|$|Self-supply is not {{formally}} {{part of the}} water strategy to increase access to improved water sources in most developing countries and is not commonly counted in inventories of access to improved water sources,. This is partly related {{to the fact that}} self-supply does not refer to a specific technology or service level. However, even in countries where significant initiatives <b>of</b> <b>self-supply</b> have been observed, these usually are not taken into consideration in official numbers of service coverage.

40|$|Abstract. Ambient energy {{harvesting}} {{has been in}} recent years the recurring object of a number of research efforts aimed at providing an autonomous solution to the powering of small scale electronic mobile devices. Among the different solutions, vibration {{energy harvesting}} has played a major role due to the almost universal presence of mechanical vibrations. In the paper, a piezoelectric cantilever device for harvesting the ambient low-frequency vibration energy is designed, and influences of its structure on output voltage and power generation capacity are studied also. The study results show that the piezoelectric cantilever can produce enough power energy which meets the operation requirements of sensors in wireless networks. It provides a method and corresponding theoretical basis for the harvesting of ambient low-frequency vibration energy and the design <b>of</b> <b>self-supply</b> devices for sensors in wireless networks...|$|R
40|$|Self-supply, where {{households}} invest {{to develop}} their own easily-accessible water supplies, is identified as an alternative service delivery model that is potentially complementary to more highly subsidised community-level provision. The approach is widespread in Ethiopia with family wells bringing additional benefits that are in line with wider government objectives, such as supporting small-scale irrigation. However, two recent studies show the current performance of traditional or family wells to be far below potential with most sources providing unsafe water in the absence of adequate protection. Wider formal recognition <b>of</b> <b>Self-supply</b> in policy and the development <b>of</b> the government-led <b>Self-supply</b> Acceleration Programme (SSAP) aim to extend access and improve aspects of performance including water quality. However, a key finding of the paper is that successful uptake of this programme requires a transformation in the attitudes of donor agencies and the roles of government regional- and woreda-level staff, amongst others. Necessary shifts in mindsets and revision of planning mechanisms, as well as the day-to-day operational support requirements, represent a challenge for an under-resourced sector. Other household-focused development interventions such as Community-led Total Sanitation (CLTS) and Household Water Treatment and Storage (HWTS) face some similar challenges, so the processes for the development of one approach could help in the scaling up of all...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{biotechnology}} {{have made}} available gene-manipulation techniques that enable {{the protection of}} genetic material from unauthorized use and the prevention <b>of</b> <b>self-supply</b> <b>of</b> commercial seeds by farmers—in order to allow enhanced appropriation {{of the values of}} innovation in agricultural R&D. These techniques have become known as Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (GURTs). This paper forecasts the potential impact of wide-spread adoption of GURTs by the providers of HYV seeds on the yield development in developing countries. To do so, it assesses (1) the effects of enhanced appropriation through GURTs on the technological expansion at the yield frontier and (2) the effects of technological protection of value-adding traits through GURTS on the diffusion of yield gains from the frontier to developing countries. These assessments are based on a particular hypothesis, which is that GURTs will replicate across most staple crops the experiences that were made with a previous use restriction technology (hybridization) in only a few crops. The estimation of impacts is carried out as a simulation and is based on expansion and diffusion parameters estimated for hybrid seeds over a 38 -year period. It shows that the impact of GURTs on developing countries' yields will vary considerably. Specifically, those countries that currently have the lowest yields would be most adversely affected in their future yield development by the wide-spread use of GURTs. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{calculate}} the self-supplied forage milk yield-necessary to promote dairy management based on self-supplied forage - from actual survey data, and to study the self-supplied forage milk yield per unit of land area, which is equivalent to land productivity. The self-supplied forage milk yields of eight dairy farmers in Hokkaido were calculated and used to categorize the farmers into three groups according to type of management: (i) dairy management which achieved high self-supplied forage milk yield through efficient use <b>of</b> <b>self-supplied</b> forage; (ii) dairy management which produced average self-supplied forage milk yield but high milk yield per delivered cow(i. e. a cow that has calved at least once) through use of purchased feed concentrates in addition to self-supplied forage; and (iii) dairy management which only produced low milk yield from self-supplied forage. Land is the most fundamental farming resource. In light of this, it is necessary to maximize the use of farmland by shifting to farm management based on self-supplied forage, which is resilient to changes in the external environment and therefore stable. To make this shift possible, efficient land use will be a priority management goal, <b>of</b> which <b>self-supplied</b> forage milk yield is a useful indicator. The case study also revealed that the self-supplied forage milk yield per unit of land area considered adequate for the management of individual dairy farmers differs from the maximum self-supplied forage milk yield that can be produced from land. Individual farmers do not experience management problems if they can earn large incomes even where their self-supplied forage milk yield per unit of land area is low. However, the fact that some farmers within a district experience self-supplied forage shortages and need to purchase feed shows the importance of improving the efficiency of the use of land, a common local resource, beyond individual farm managemen...|$|R

Inorganic contaminants were detected in many of the wells, and concentrations exceeded the U. S. EPA maximum contaminant levels (MCLs; federal drinking water standards used to regulate public drinking water quality) more often than organic contaminants. Of the inor-ganic constituents evaluated, arsenic concentrations exceeded the MCL (10 lg/L) in ~ 11 % of the 7580 wells evaluated, nitrate exceeded the MCL (10 mg/L) in ~ 8 % of the 3465 wells evaluated, uranium- 238 exceeded the MCL (30 lg/L) in ~ 4 % of the wells, and radon- 222 exceeded 300 and 4000 pCi/L (potential drinking water standards currently under review by the U. S. EPA) in ~ 75 % and 9 % of the wells, respectively. The MCLs for total mercury and fluoride were each exceeded in < 1 % of the wells evaluated. The MCL was exceeded in < 1 % of all wells for all anthropogenically derived organic contaminants evaluated and was not exceeded for many contaminants. In addition, 10 contaminants evaluated do not currently have an MCL. Atrazine, however, was detected in 24 % of the wells evaluated and was the most frequently detected organic contaminant of the 28 organic contaminants evaluated in this study.
