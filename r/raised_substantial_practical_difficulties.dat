40|$|This paper reviews some methodological {{aspects of}} ecologic studies of human health, with {{emphasis}} on investigations of environmental quality. A recent census of Canadian and U. S. data sets potentially suitable {{for this type of}} study is summarized. It is concluded that despite the considerable utility of the ecologic design for this purpose, <b>substantial</b> <b>practical</b> <b>difficulties</b> are common in their implementation. Particular problems are the relative scarcity of relevant environmental data and complications associated with rendering them compatible with health data...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{cladistic}} {{analyses of}} green plants recognize an extensive hierarchical series of relatively well-supported monophyletic groups. Translating this hierarchical pattern of relationships into a usable and informative written classification {{is important for}} purposes of scientific communication, research and teaching. However, {{in the context of}} the 2 ̆ 2 Linnean 2 ̆ 2 hierarchy, as manifested in the current International code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN), effecting this translation confronts <b>substantial</b> <b>practical</b> <b>difficulties</b> [...] especially the proliferation of hierarchical levels. These problems are exacerbated by the current emphasis of the ICBN on a hierarchy in which different ranks have different formal rank-based endings. These difficulties could be ameliorated by de-emphasizing the importance of ranks in the ICBN and relaxing the constraints on how they are treated, especially at the higher taxonomic levels. Modifications are needed that permit a more straightforward integration of systematic knowledge and botanical nomenclature, and at the same time foster increased stability in the association between names and the groups of organisms that they designate...|$|R
40|$|At-sentencing risk {{assessments}} are predictions of an individual’s statistically likely future criminal conduct. These assessments {{can be derived}} from a number of methodologies ranging from unstructured clinical judgment to advanced statistical and actuarial processes. Some assessments consider only correlates of criminal recidivism, while others also take into account criminogenic needs. Assessments of this nature have long been used to classify defendants for treatment and supervision within prisons and on community supervision, but they have only relatively recently begun to be used – or considered for use – during the sentencing process. This shift in application has <b>raised</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>practical</b> and policy challenges and questions. This paper, supported by the U. S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance, directly addresses these issues and provides information and examples from a range of jurisdictions, including some which have integrated at-sentencing risk assessment programs in place or {{are in the process of}} doing so. Derived from a survey of judges, as well as a series of interviews with stakeholders from across the nation, opportunities for future research and planning to guide the cautious engagement with at-sentencing risk assessment are identified...|$|R
40|$|European {{competition}} laws condemn as ‘exploitative abuses’ the pricing policies of dominant firms {{that may result}} in a direct loss of consumer welfare. Article 82 (a) of the EC Treaty, for example, expressly states that imposing ‘unfair’ prices on consumers by dominant suppliers constitutes an abuse. Several firms have been found to abuse their dominant positions by charging excessive prices in cases brought by the European Commission and the competition authorities of several Member States. Those cases show that the assessment of excessive pricing is subject to <b>substantial</b> conceptual and <b>practical</b> <b>difficulties,</b> and that any policy that seeks to detect and prohibit excessive prices is likely to yield incorrect predictions in numerous instances. In this Paper we evaluate {{the pros and cons of}} alternative legal standards towards excessive pricing by explicitly considering the likelihood of false convictions/acquittals and the costs associated with those errors. We find that the legal standard that maximizes long-term consumer welfare given the information typically available to regulators would involve no ex post intervention on the pricing decisions of dominant firms. A possible exception to this general rule is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{awareness}} of the inadequacy of the traditional framework of international law {{as a means of}} dealing with current environmental problems. This has led to calls for a new approach. In view of the links between the protection of the environment and the protection of human rights, one such approach has been to focus on the development of international human rights law concepts and mechanisms to address environmental concerns. This thesis undertakes a critical assessment of a human rights approach to environmental protection, with the aim of suggesting ways in which it could realistically contribute to the protection of the global environment. I consider how the environment may be protected both through the application of presently accepted human rights and through the establishment of a new human right in relation to the environment. I highlight the objections that are raised from both a human rights perspective and an environmental perspective and examine the <b>substantial</b> conceptual and <b>practical</b> <b>difficulties</b> that are encountered. I ultimately attempt to show that although a human rights approach has serious limitations and is unlikely to fulfill the aspirations of its promoters, it does have modest value as one strand of a much wider strategy for environmental protection under international law...|$|R
