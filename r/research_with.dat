5|$|Arrington {{completed}} much of {{the research}} for Great Basin Kingdom in the LDS Church library archives. Aware of the LDS Church Archives's hostility to academic research at the time, Arrington took John A. Widtsoe's advice and started his <b>research</b> <b>with</b> published materials and theses, working up to unpublished materials. Arrington was able to circumvent A. William Lund's policy of personally approving all notes taken in the archives: Arrington took his notes on a typewriter using carbon copy paper, enabling him to leave a copy with Lund and take his own copy home. In order to rewrite his dissertation into Great Basin Kingdom, Arrington took a sabbatical 1956–1957 and was granted a fellowship at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.|$|E
5|$|Attorneys {{criticized the}} show as {{unrealistic}} due to numerous violations of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct by the fictional attorneys on the show.

5|$|Beebe's {{position}} in the Zoological Society underwent a change in 1918: He was given the title of Honorary Curator of Birds, and was made {{the director of the}} newly created Department of Tropical <b>Research.</b> <b>With</b> his new position, Beebe no longer had the duty of caring for the zoo's animals, freeing him to devote himself fully to his writing and research. Beebe's duties as curator were passed to Lee Crandall, the former Assistant Curator who had worked under Beebe, although Crandall continued to rely on Beebe for help treating illness in birds, and caring for the exotic birds brought back from Beebe's expeditions.|$|E

To prepare, Fukunaga conducted <b>research</b> <b>with</b> a real-life homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division. The director brought on Adam Arkapaw as the project cinematographer, and hired Alex DiGerlando, who he worked with on Benh Zeitlin's Glory at Sea (2008), as the production designer.|$|E
5|$|Dr Eric Underwood {{began his}} {{research}} at Avondale in the mid-1930s also utilising the sheep flocks.

These experiments were {{the first of many}} by Underwood over the next 30 years. During the 1940s he studied the nutritional value of hay and pasture for sheep, the ongoing results from these Studies in Cereal Hay production in Western Australia were published in the Journal of Agriculture.|$|E

40|$|<b>Researching</b> <b>with</b> older {{participants}} presents many unique methodological challenges. One of {{the reasons}} for this is the greater variability in abilities among older than among younger people. Thus, the standard practice in user research of assuming homogeneity in a certain demographic group may not work with older adults. Designing experiments for users with diverse capabilities is challenging and calls for re-examination of existing experimental design methods. In this paper we will share our experience in <b>researching</b> <b>with</b> people with diverse capabilities and present its implications and possible way to address them...|$|R
