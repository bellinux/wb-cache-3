50|$|Ribozymes (<b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>enzymes)</b> are RNA {{molecules}} that {{are capable of}} catalyzing specific biochemical reactions, similar to the action of protein enzymes. The 1982 discovery of ribozymes demonstrated that RNA can be both genetic material (like DNA) and a biological catalyst (like protein enzymes), and contributed to the RNA world hypothesis, which suggests that RNA may have been important in the evolution of prebiotic self-replicating systems. The most common activities of natural or in vitro-evolved ribozymes are the cleavage or ligation of RNA and DNA and peptide bond formation. Within the ribosome, ribozymes function as part of the large subunit ribosomal RNA to link amino acids during protein synthesis. They also participate in a variety of RNA processing reactions, including RNA splicing, viral replication, and transfer RNA biosynthesis. Examples of ribozymes include the hammerhead ribozyme, the VS ribozyme, Leadzyme and the hairpin ribozyme.|$|R

Four main glycoform populations were identified in RNase B, each of which was homogeneous and associated with one phosphate group.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the regulation of}} a transfer <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (tRNA) biosynthetic <b>enzyme,</b> the tRNA(m 5 U) methyltransferase (EC 2. 1. 1. 35). This enzyme catalyzes the formation of 5 -methyluridine (m 5 U, ribothymidine) in all tRNA chains of Escherichia coli. Partial deprivation of charged tRNAVal can be imposed by shifting strains carrying a temperature-sensitive valyl-tRNA ligase from a permissive to a semipermissive temperature. By using two such strains differing only in the allelic state of the relA gene, {{it was possible to}} show the tRNA(m 5 U) methyltransferase to be stringently regulated. Upon partial deprivation of charged tRNAVal, the differential rate of tRNA(m 5 U) methyltransferase synthesis was found to decrease in a strain with stringent RNA control (relA+), whereas it increased in the strain carrying the relA allele. This increase of accumulation of tRNA(m 5 U) methyltransferase activity required protein synthesis. Thus, when tRNA is partially uncharged in the cell, the relA gene product influences the expression of tRNA(m 5 U) methyltransferase gene...|$|R

Purified deoxyribonucleic acid-like <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> and tenaciously bound <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> fractions both contained poly-adenosine monophosphate sequences (those from {{the latter being}} longer than those from the former); without these poly-adenosine monophosphate sequences their base compositions were the same. The average poly-adenosine monophosphate sequence from purified tenaciously bound <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> was 160 residues long, as measured by gel electrophoresis. However, base hydrolysis and chromatography indicated one 3 ′-nucleoside (adenosine) per 71 nucleotides, giving a chain length of 72 residues. The dominant species in the cytoplasm, as measured by radioactive precursor incorporation, was tenaciously bound <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> whereas deoxyribonucleic acid-like <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> was present in greater amounts in the nucleus.

40|$|Mutant {{strains of}} Escherichia coli K- 12 have been {{isolated}} {{in which the}} synthesis of 3 -deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonic acid- 7 -phosphate (DAHP) synthetase (trp) is partially constitutive. The mutation causing derepression is closely linked to aroH [the structural gene for DAHP synthetase (trp) ] and occurs in a locus designated aroJ. The aroJ mutation is not recessive in an aroJ+/aroJ− diploid strain, as the synthesis of DAHP synthetase (trp) is still derepressed in this strain. On {{the basis of its}} close linkage to aroH and its continued expression in an aroJ+/aroJ− diploid, it is postulated that aroJ is an operator locus controlling the expression of the structural gene aroH. In support of this conclusion, the synthesis of anthranilate synthetase is still normally repressible in aroJ− strains, whereas, in trpR− strains, both DAHP synthetase (trp) and anthranilate synthetase are synthesized constitutively. The synthesis of DAHP synthetase (trp) remains repressible in an operator-constitutive mutant of the tryptophan operon. In two trpS mutants which possess defective tryptophanyl transfer <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> synthetase <b>enzymes,</b> neither DAHP synthetase (trp) nor anthranilate synthetase derepress under conditions in which the defective synthetase causes a decrease in growth rate. On the other hand, an effect of the trpS mutant alleles on the level of anthranilate synthetase has been observed in strains which are derepressed for the synthesis of this enzyme, because of a mutation in the gene trpR. Possible explanations for this effect are presented...|$|R
40|$|A “nuclear fraction” {{prepared}} from Bacillus subtilis was a {{more efficient}} template than purified deoxyribonucleic acid for the synthesis of <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> by exogenously added <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> polymerase isolated from B. subtilis.

The addition of pyridoxal- 5 ′-monophosphate to cultures of strain ilvA 504 growing in excess isoleucine, valine, and leucine resulted in an increased rate of growth and repression of the synthesis of the isoleucine and valine biosynthetic enzymes.

In a recent paper by Koch et al. (1952) these authors state in a footnote that "purines, like phosphorus, do not turn over in the RNA of the infected cell". The apparent inertness of the <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> of the infected cell might be explained in several ways: (1) It is possible that in the growing host the enzymatic pathway leading from precursors such as glycine and inorganic phosphate to <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> is a reversible one and accord-ingly in a state of dynamic equilibrium. If this is the case, isotopic precursors could be incorporated into the <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> without a net increase of the <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid.</b> Incorporation of isotope by such a mechanism could be termed "incorpora-tion by exchange". To explain the lack of incorporation of isotope into the <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> during phage infection, one would have to postulate that there is an inhibition during phage infection of {{one or more of the}} enzymes in this pathway, preventing incorporation of isotope into the <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid.</b> (2) Synthesis and degradation of the <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> of the growing cell could be taking place by different enzymatic pathways, both essentially irreversible.
