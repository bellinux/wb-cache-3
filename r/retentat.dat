Das dazu entwickelte und favorisierte Verfahren zur Verarbeitung des Prozesswassers besteht im ersten Prozessschritt in der größtmöglichen mechanischen Abtrennung der sedimentierbaren Mehlinhaltsstoffe im Zentrifugalfeld von Separatoren oder Dekantern. Das mittels Separatoren geklärte Prozesswasser wird nach Zugabe von α-Amylase mit einem Jet-Kocher aufgekocht, anschließend zentrifugal separiert. Das so thermisch behandelte und geklärte Prozesswasser wird mit Glucoamylase verzuckert. Das verzuckerte Prozesswasser wird mit einem Tellerseparator zentrifugiert, um die während der Verzuckerung koagulierten und flokkulierten Protein-Lipid-Bestandteile zu separieren. Dabei werden von den in dieser Prozessstufe vorhandenen Lipiden und Proteinen mehr als 90 % (Lipide) bzw. ca. 50 % (Proteine) aus dem Prozesswasser entfernt. Das so aufbereitete Prozesswasser wird ultrafiltriert. Die Ultrafiltration des geklärten Prozesswassers erfolgt mit industriellen Membranfiltern aus Polyethersulfon mit einer Trenngrenze von 100. 000 Dalton. Die Zugabe von Protease während der Ultrafiltration erhöht die Filtrations-geschwindigkeit und senkt den Proteingehalt des Endproduktes. Das <b>Retentat</b> wird pasteurisiert und bis auf 25 - 30 % TS durch Eindampfen konzentriert. Das glucosereiche Permeat wird ebenfalls eingedampft (> 50 % TS). Das Permeat-konzentrat erfüllt die an ein Fermentationssubstrat für die Backhefeindustrie zu stellenden Anforderungen. Die Brüdenkondensate aus der Retentat- und Permeatkonzentration können in den Prozess der Stärkegewinnung zurückgeführt werden. Aus dem Retentatkonzentrat wird mittels ethanolischer Fällung ein wasserlösliches Arabinoxylan präzipitiert, das mit einem Ultrarotor zu einem fasrigen Ballaststoff mahlgetrocknet wird. Das in der Abluft der Arabinoxylantrocknung befindliche Ethanol wird mit einem entsprechend ausgestatteten Ultrarotor-System zurückgewonnen. Das aus der Ethanol-aufarbeitung anfallende glucose- und proteinhaltige Konzentrat kann als Vinasseersatz zur Pelletierung von Futtermitteln genutzt werden. Die Wirtschaftlichkeitsbetrachtung für das entwickelte Verfahren basiert auf der Annahme einer Verarbeitung von 20 t Prozesswasser/h und einer Ausbeute an wasserlöslichem Arabinoxylan-Ballaststoffkonzentrat von 100 kg TS/h. Das Ergebnis der Wirtschaftlichkeitsbetrachtung zeigt, dass eine technische Realisierung des Verfahrens weitere Optimierungen des Verfahrens im Hinblick auf Ausbeutesteigerungen insbesondere im Bereich des Hauptprodukts erfordert, um die Wirtschaftlichkeit sicherzustellen. Die Umsetzung eines solchen Verfahrens ist ein erstrebenswertes Ziel, weil durch den Einsatz des zurückgewonnenen Wassers rund ein Drittel des eingesetzten Frischwassers in der Stärkefabrik verbleibt. Objective of {{this work}} was the {{production}} of dietetic effective soluble fibre (water-soluble Arabinoxylan) from the process water of the wheat starch industry and the complex processing {{as well as economic}} utilization of all material streams and products resulting from the processing. The first step of the procedure for the processing of the process water, favored developed in addition of the highest possible mechanical separation of the flour contents materials in the centrifugal field of separators or decanters. The process water, clarified by separators, is boiled up with a jet digester after addition of α-Amylase and afterwards separated centrifugally. The so thermally treated and clarified process water is saccharified with Glucoamylase. The saccharified process water is centrifuged with a self-desludging centrifuges, in order to separate the Protein-Lipid components which are coagulated and flocculated during the saccharification step. More than 90 % (Lipids) of the existing Lipid and approx. 50 % protein from the process water will be removed. The in such a way prepared process water is ultrafiltrated. The ultrafiltration of the clarified process water was done with industrial membrane filters from Polyethersulfon with a cut-off point from 100. 000 Dalton. The addition of Protease during the ultrafiltration increases the filtration speed and lowers the protein content of the final product. The <b>Retentat</b> is pasteurized and concentrated up to 25 - 30 % TS by evaporation. The glucose-rich Permeat is evaporated likewise (> 50 % TS). The Permeat concentrate fulfills the requirements of the fermentation substrate for the yeast industry. The vapor condensates from the <b>Retentat</b> and Permeat concentration can be led back into the process of the starch production. From the <b>Retentat</b> concentrate by means of ethanolic precipitation a water-soluble Arabinoxylan is precipitated, filtered out, dried and ground with an Ultrarotor to a dietetic effective soluble fibre. Ethanol in the exhausted air of the Arabinoxylan drying can be recovers with an accordingly equipped Ultrarotor system. The concentrate resulting from the ethanol processing contains glucose and protein and can be used as Vinasse to pelletizing of animal feeds. View of economy for the developed procedure is based on the processing of 20 t process water/h and a yield at water-soluble Arabinoxylan dietary fibre concentrate of 100 kg of TS/h. The result of view of economy shows that a technical realization of the procedure requires further optimizations of the procedure regarding yield increases in particular within the range of the main product, in order to guarantee economy. The conversion of such a procedure is a worthwhile goal, because by the employment of the recovered water a third of the assigned fresh water remains approximately in the starch factory...|$|E

It has soft or semi-hard texture and a salty, acid taste. There are similar types of Turkish white cheese around the world such as Bulgaria’s Sirene, Romania’s Telamme, Greece’s Feta,Yugoslavia’s  Primonski Sir and Grobniciki  Sir,  Israel’s Brinsa, America’s Queso Blanco and  Pickle  Cheese  and  Egypt’s Domiati  cheese.   Membrane filtration techniques are used in the milk industry for several purposes such as fractionation of milk fat from whole milk, removal of bacteria and spores from milk, standardization or enrichment of protein content of the milk etc. Membrane filtration techniques are readily used in cheese production, since cheese production is actually a kind of concentration (enrichment) process. Ultrafiltration and microfiltration are the major membrane processes employed in the cheese industry. These filtration processes are used to produce cheese from milk retentates. Ultrafiltration has been applied to cheese production over the past 45 years, whereas microfiltration is a more recent technology. Although ultrafiltration offers some benefits in cheese manufacturing such as improvement in hygienic capacity, minimal heating, increased cheese yield, homogeneity {{of the quality of the}} final cheese product, it is observed to have negative impacts on cheese quality due to the enrichment of whey proteins in the ultrafiltrated milk. However, in microfiltration larger membrane pore sizes are used. For this reason, the enrichment of whey proteins in cheese milk is less. Milk is a complex mixture of different components such as fat, protein, lactose, minerals, etc. These components have unique nutritional and functional characteristics. Whey proteins represent approximately 20 % of the milk proteins. In traditional cheese production whey proteins remain in the whey with fat, caseinomacropeptides, rennet, etc. For this reason, purification or concentration of whey proteins is difficult and expensive. Also, whey has low solid content and high biological oxygen demand (BOD), which creates a major disposal problem. On the other hand, the permeate stream obtained after microfiltration of milk is referred to as “ideal whey” since it contains whey proteins that do not contribute to the cheesemaking process. Thus, unlike classical whey, ideal whey has sterile native components with higly functional properties and also no fat in its composition. The presence of fat in whey leads to decreased functional properties and shorter storage life. Moreover, microfiltered whey proteins maintain their biological activity and have a better flavor profile than classical whey. Therefore, ideal whey is a much better raw material for manufacturing high quality whey protein ingredients. The aim of the present study is to investigate the chemical composition and the quality parameters of white brined cheese obtained from pasteurized milk enriched upon microfiltration. For this purpose, two types of microfiltration membranes were used: a polyethersulfone membrane (MP 005) with a pore size of 0. 05 μm, and a polyvilidene fluoride membrane (MV 020) with a pore size of 0. 20 μm. Microfiltration equipment used is a laboratory scale SEPA CF-II membrane test unit equipped with a flat plate. Enrichment factors of 1. 59, 1. 71, 1. 85, and 1. 93 were achieved with the polyethersulfone membrane, whereas the enrichment factor was 1. 24 with the polyvilidene fluoride membrane. Chemical compositions of the permeate and the retentate streams were analyzed with respect to dry matter, protein, fat and ash contents.   White cheese was obtained from the retentate streams enriched upon microfiltration. White cheese obtained directly from pasteurized milk was used as the control sample. Chemical compositions of the white brined cheese samples were analyzed with regard to dry matter, protein, fat, ash, salt contents and acidity. Whey obtained upon cheese making was analyzed with respect to dry matter, protein and ash contents.

40|$|Cet article propose une étude de la rétention du nitrate d'ammonium par une {{membrane}} commerciale de nanofiltration (Nanomax 50). Les effets de la pression, de la concentration et de la vitesse d'écoulement tangentiel ont été étudiés avec le souci d'une meilleure compréhension du mécanisme de transport des ions nitrate et en vue d'une optimisation de la rétention. Le taux de rétention des ions nitrate augmente dans un premier temps avec la pression, atteint un maximum puis diminue. La rétention, pour des pressions élevées, peut cependant être améliorée en augmentant la vitesse d'écoulement tangentiel. La séparation résulterait d'un rapport de différentes forces : une force d'entraînement radial dans le pore (illustrée par l'effet de la pression transmembranaire), une force d'entraînement tangentiel vers le <b>rétentat</b> (illustrée par l'effet de la vitesse d'écoulement tangentiel) et une force de surface traduisant les interactions membrane-soluté (illustrée par l'effet de la concentration). L'équation de Spiegler et Kedem est proposée en première approche de modélisation pour une valeur limite de pression. Many {{water sources}} {{deal with the}} problem of increasing nitrate concentrations above authorised levels for drinking water. In order to minimise this amount of pollution and to achieve high quality of water and reused water in the distribution system, membrane processes are becoming a promising technology. Indeed, they present the major advantages of a small land area requirement, low temperature operation, continuous separation, better effluent quality, little or no sludge production and a large reduction in the quantities of chemical additives. Reverse osmosis has already been used to remove most of the nitrates together with the other solutes, but the disadvantage is that this technique induces a total demineralisation of the treated water. Another possible filtration process, nanofiltration, has been investigated in this study while no extensive research has been carried out on its nitrate removal potential. Theories cannot adequately predict the influence of operating parameters on membrane performance. Consequently, new membranes and modules must be experimentally evaluated for each new application. The main objective {{of this study was to}} provide fundamental data for designing an operation of nanofiltration under various operating conditions such as transmembrane pressure, cross-flow velocity and initial feed concentration for drinking water and water reuse purposes. The retention rate rises with an increase of the applied pressure, reaches a maximum and then decreases. Such a result is quite different from those usually mentioned in the literature where the retention increases and reaches a plateau when the pressure grows. The singular decrease of the retention rate observed in this study could be explained in terms of a concentration polarization phenomenon. However, since the volumetric flux increased linearly with the pressure and remained close to the pure water flux, it might be thought that such an assumption is not valid in the case of this work. Therefore, another hypothesis has to be provided to explain the variation of the retention with transmembrane pressure. As the size of NH 4 + ion (ionic radius= 0. 148 nm) is lower than that of the pore of membrane (diameter= 1 nm), cations can enter the pores where they are partially retained due to surface forces (electrostatic and friction forces). When the pressure increases, these forces remain constant while drag forces increase due to the flux in the pore. At low pressure (∆P < 5 bars), the surface forces are stronger than the drag forces. Therefore, the solute flux remains low while the solvent flux increases with the pressure, leading to an increase in the solute retention. Above a given pressure (≅ 5 bars), the drag forces become higher than the surface forces. Consequently, the retention rate decreases. As can be observed in the obtained results, the retention rate decreased when the feed concentration was increased regardless of the operating pressure. This effect is mainly attributed to the cation shielding of the effective charge of the membrane. This characteristic can be explained by the fact that the electric repulsion becomes less efficient at higher concentration. It has been recognized that the effective charge density of the membrane decreases with an increase in the feed concentration of an ionic solution. Consequently, the retention rate of the co-ion due to charge effect is reduced. It follows that a greater amount of nitrate ions could permeate when feed solutions of higher concentration are applied. The effect of cross-flow velocity on the fluxes is insignificant since the permeate flux depends only on transmembrane pressure. However, the retention performance increases with velocity. The lower the cross-flow velocity, the higher the interaction between the solute and the membrane. Therefore, at low cross-flow rate, the solute amount that enters the membrane pores is high. When the drag forces become stronger than the surface forces, as explained above, the retention sharply decreases. At high cross-flow velocity, the feed circulation transports a large solute amount and therefore, the solute amount that enters the pores is reduced and is less sensitive to operating pressure. In consequence, the sensitivity of the retention to transmembrane pressure is not so marked. It might be thought that for a very high cross-flow velocity, the retention increases and then remains constant. It was demonstrated in this work that nanofiltration can be successfully used to remove nitrates from water. The retention was shown to depend strongly on operating parameters such as feed solution concentration, applied pressure and circulation cross-flow rate. In fact, the retention is mainly determined by the intensity of the solute / membrane interaction. This interaction comes from two main forces: a tangential one due to the feed solute flow (illustrated by the cross-flow velocity effect) and a radial one in the pores due to drag forces (illustrated by the transmembrane pressure effect). Moreover, it was observed that the valence of the associated ions is an important factor that can affect nitrate retention. It can be expected that the optimization of the separation performance will result of the best combination of all these parameters. Therefore, with a view to a future industrial application, it will be necessary to take into consideration the chemical composition of the resource and to adapt the operating conditions to the desired objectives...|$|E
