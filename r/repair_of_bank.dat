30|$|That {{valuable}} {{natural resources}} lie within its boundaries {{is a condition}} hardly unique to Léogâne. Just as elsewhere across Haiti, these ecosystem services represent one of its greatest assets. These, unfortunately, {{have been subject to}} degradation. Therefore, environmental stabilization and resource regeneration are necessary preconditions to the development of energy systems, agricultural improvements, industry and economic development. Stormwater management, flood control, soil stabilization and reforestation are critical prerequisites to the installation of the energy corridor. A program <b>of</b> river stabilization (<b>repair</b> <b>of</b> eroding <b>banks</b> and other flood control measures constructed with local materials) will alleviate hazardous deluges that occur during tropical downpours. New reservoirs located upland will store stormwater for irrigation. Riparian buffering, described below, will help reinvigorate damaged marginal areas, while the introduction of new agriculture, agroforestry, aquaculture practices, and the new rural settlements supporting them, will stabilize the topography and restore hydrological systems.|$|R
5000|$|Lengthsmen were {{specific}} {{workers on}} the English canal system from its inception in the late 18th century, [...] "lengthsmen" [...] being responsible especially for lengths of towpath {{and in the absence}} of a lock-keeper, for locks and their trappings and surroundings. Many lived in isolated cottages which, if close to a lock, might include lock keeper duties, including management of water levels and control of weirs. Lengthsmen were also responsible for <b>repair</b> and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> on their [...] "length", including cutting reeds and vegetation and the treading puddle clay into sections <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> which were weak or suffering from leakage.

25|$|The Commissioners had {{employed}} {{teams of}} gaulters throughout the 19th and early 20th century, who got their {{name from the}} use of an impervious type of clay called gault, which was obtained from Roswell Pits at Ely, and used to <b>repair</b> the <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> the rivers and the cross dyke. The teams consisted of three men, who managed a train of five boats between them, each capable of holding 8 tons of gault. The boats were owned by the Commissioners, but the men were responsible for the provision of a horse, shovels and barrows. In 1886, new terms of employment were negotiated by the Commissioners, as they felt that the wages earned by the men were excessive. In 1920, the Ouse Drainage Board was established, and responsibility for the maintenance <b>of</b> the river <b>banks</b> passed to them, so the Commissioners laid off the men and sold the boats.|$|R
40|$|Summary for non-specialistsThe global {{financial}} crisis {{has led to}} a sharp deterioration of EU countries' public finances. Views are split regarding the most appropriate consolidation strategy to follow, in particular considering: the timing of fiscal consolidation in relation to the path of economic recovery reflecting (a) the trade-off between consolidation and stabilisation; (b) fiscal consolidation in the context <b>of</b> a distressed <b>banking</b> system where the credit channel is hampered and without which economic recovery can hardly take place, (c) the absence of exchange rate adjustment in the euro area which could {{make it more difficult for}} countries with competitiveness problems to achieve successful fiscal consolidation. The existing literature on fiscal consolidations provides only partial evidence on these issues. In this paper our objective is to focus on the above points of discussion drawing on EU (and non-EU OECD) experiences during the period 1970 - 2008. We estimate econometrically the determinants of successful fiscal consolidations and show that: (i) in presence of a systemic financial crisis, the <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> the <b>banking</b> sector is a pre-condition for a fiscal consolidation to succeed in reducing debt levels (ii) even after the banking sector is repaired, fiscal consolidations are usually less successful than in absence of financial crises, although more vigorous fiscal consolidations (i. e. cold shower) tend to yield higher results (iii) current debt dynamics in the EU are very unfavourable and in some cases, coupled with rising debt servicing costs and much deteriorated growth outlook warranting differentiated consolidation strategies across EU countries (iv) We do not find conclusive evidence in support of exchange rates (including real exchange rate) depreciation/devaluation as enhancing the success of fiscal consolidation as their effect appear to be low and insignificant.

40|$|To {{efficiently}} {{protect the}} integrity of genetic information, transcription is connected to nucleotide excision repair (NER), which allows preferential <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> the transcribed DNA strands (TS). As yet, the molecular basis of this connection remains elusive in eukaryotic cells. Here we show that, in haploids, the RAD 26 gene {{is essential for the}} preferential <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> the TS during G 1. However, in G 2 /M phase there is an additional RAD 51 -dependent process that enhances <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> TS. Importantly, the simultaneous deletion of both RAD 26 and RAD 51 led to complete abolishment <b>of</b> strand-specific <b>repair</b> during G 2 /M, indicating that these genes act through two independent but complementary subpathways. In diploids, however, RAD 51 is involved in <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> the TS even in G 1 phase, which unveils the implication of homologous recombination in the preferential <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> the TS.
