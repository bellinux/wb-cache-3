A multiplication of the three terms results in the Q parameter, which can range between 0.001 for an exceptionally poor to 1000 for an exceptionally good rock mass. The numerical values of the class boundaries for the different rock mass qualities are subdivisions of the Q range on a logarithmic scale.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a procedure {{based on the}} use of grey numbers for the calibration (with uncertainty) of pipe roughness in water distribution systems. The pipe roughness uncertainty is represented through the grey number amplitude (or interval). The procedure per se is of a wholly general nature and can be applied for the calibration (with uncertainty) of other parameters or quantities, such as nodal demands. In this paper, for the purpose of roughness calibration, a certain number of nodal head measurements made under different demand conditions is assumed to be available at different locations (nodes); all other topological and geometric characteristics of the system are considered to be known exactly. The general approach to pipe roughness calibration (taking account of uncertainty) focuses on identifying the grey roughness values, which produce grey head values, at the measuring nodes, such as to encompass the observed values grouped {{on the basis of the}} different demand scenarios and, at the same time, have as small an “amplitude” as possible. The proposed procedure was applied to two synthetic case studies and to one real network. The tests on the synthetic case studies show that the proposed procedure is able to solve correctly the inverse problem, i. e. it can identify the known grey <b>roughness</b> <b>numbers</b> even when they overlap; the same applies when the known grey <b>roughness</b> <b>numbers</b> collapse into known white <b>roughness</b> <b>numbers.</b> The test on the real case offers the possibility to highlight the potentials of the procedure when applied within a context where measurement errors and other uncertainties are present. The procedure entails computing times that may become lengthy. However, it is possible to reduce these computing times considerably by replacing the hydraulic simulator – to which a number of calls must be made during the calibration procedure (for objective function evaluation) – with an approximation based on a first- order Taylor series expansion. This approach introduces acceptable approximations within the context of the problem considered...|$|R

The experimental data presented are compared {{on the basis of}} effective <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>number</b> since this parameter is not sensitive to flow conditions downstream of the roughness. The discussion covers the effective <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>number</b> as a function of <b>roughness</b> position Reynolds <b>number,</b> effective size ratio as a function of pressure gradient and distance from vehicle nose, and effect of spanwise roughness position on roughness effectiveness. It is shown that conventional criteria for sizing roughness elements which promote transition in two-dimensional zero-pressure gradient flows are insufficient for high-pressure gradient flows and three-dimensional flows.

40|$|A tiled {{approach}} to rough surface simulation {{is used to}} explore {{the full range of}} <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>numbers,</b> from the limiting case of hydrodynamic smoothness up to fully rough conditions. The surface is based on a scan of a standard grit-blasted comparator, subsequently low-pass filtered and made spatially periodic. High <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>numbers</b> are obtained by increasing the friction Reynolds number of the direct numerical simulations, whereas low <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>numbers</b> are obtained by scaling the surface down and tiling to maintain a constant domain size. In both cases, computational requirements on box size, resolution in wall units and resolution per minimum wavelength of the rough surface are maintained. The resulting roughness function behaviour replicates to good accuracy the experiments of Nikuradse (1933 VDI-Forschungsheft, vol. 361), suggesting that the processed grit-blasted surface can serve as a surrogate for his sand-grain roughness, the precise structure of which is undocumented. The present simulations also document a monotonic departure from hydrodynamic smooth-wall results, which is fitted with a geometric relation, the exponent of which is found to be inconsistent with both the Colebrook formula and an earlier theoretical argument based on low-Reynolds-number drag relations...|$|R
50|$|Q-slope {{utilizes}} similar parameters to the Q-system {{which has}} been used for over 40 years in the design of ground support for tunnels and underground excavations. The first four parameters, RQD (rock quality designation), Jn (joint set number), Jr (joint <b>roughness</b> <b>number)</b> and Ja (joint alteration number) are the same as in the Q-system. However, the frictional resistance pair Jr and Ja can apply, when needed, to individual sides of a potentially unstable wedges. Simply applied orientation factors (0), like (Jr/Ja)1x0.7 for set J1 and (Jr/Ja)2x0.9 for set J2, provide estimates of overall whole-wedge frictional resistance reduction, if appropriate. The Q-system term Jw is replaced with Jwice, and takes into account a wider range of environmental conditions appropriate to rock slopes, which are exposed to the environment indefinitely. The conditions include the extremes of erosive intense rainfall, ice wedging, as may seasonally occur at opposite ends of the rock-type and regional spectrum. There are also slope-relevant SRF (strength reduction factor) categories.|$|E

Tool replacement decisions are dependent on sensing the wear on the tool or predicting its magnitude by empirical models. This study is an attempt to establish a tool replacement strategy that optimizes a selected performance objective.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new extension for k-omega turbulence models {{to account for}} surface roughness for transitionally and fully rough surfaces. It {{is based on the}} equivalent sand grain approach and accounts for theoretical considerations on the log-layer solution for fully rough surfaces. An appropriate behaviour for transitional roughness is achieved by means of wall values for k and omega which depend on the <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>number.</b> In the limit of vanishing roughness, the smooth wall boundary condition is recovered. For the full range of <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>numbers</b> the new <b>roughness</b> modification gives very successful predictions for a variety of flat plate turbulent boundary layer flows and for the pipe flow experiments by Nikuradse. The new method allows for the simulation of flows over rough surfaces at the same grid resolution requirements as for smooth walls. Thereby the extremely fine near-wall mesh resolution required by the Wilcox roughness modification is avoided. Secondly the new roughness modification gives significantly improved predictions in skin friction for transitional <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>numbers</b> compared to the roughness extension by Wilcox. Thirdly, the new roughness extension does not require a modification of the SST k-omega model, whereas a modification is necessary if the roughness extension by Wilcox is used.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} framework {{to model the}} electrokinetic transport in microchannels with random roughness. The three-dimensional microstructure of the rough channel is generated by a random generation-growth method with three statistical parameters to control the number density, the total volume fraction, and the anisotropy characteristics of roughness elements. The governing equations for the electrokinetic transport are solved by a high-efficiency lattice Poisson?Boltzmann method in complex geometries. The effects from the geometric characteristics of roughness on the electrokinetic transport in microchannels are therefore modeled and analyzed. For a given total roughness volume fraction, a higher number density leads to a lower fluctuation because of the random factors. The electroosmotic flow rate increases with the <b>roughness</b> <b>number</b> density nearly logarithmically for a given volume fraction of roughness but decreases with the volume fraction for a given <b>roughness</b> <b>number</b> density. When both the volume fraction and the number density of roughness are given, the electroosmotic flow rate is enhanced by the increase of the characteristic length along the external electric field direction but is reduced by that in the direction across the channel. For a given microstructure of the rough microchannel, the electroosmotic flow rate decreases with the Debye length. It is found that the shape resistance of roughness {{is responsible for the}} flow rate reduction in the rough channel compared to the smooth channel even for very thin double layers, and hence {{plays an important role in}} microchannel electroosmotic flows...|$|E

In agreement with previous experimental observations at low speed, unsteady release of hairpin vortices past the disturbing element is observed at sufficiently high Rek for all Mach numbers, which eventually results in the breakdown to turbulence. A similar vortex organization is found for all flow cases which experience transition, regardless of the Mach number, the main effect of roughness consisting in the generation of streamwise and wall-normal vorticity, with the formation of an unstable detached shear-layer on the top of the element.

The majority of the speckle applications are based on analysis of dependence of scattered light intensity distribution from sizes of the scattereres. We propose a numerical model of speckle formation in reflected light in one-dimension which shows that properties of the scattered light are strongly dependent on the form of the scatterers. In particular, the dependence of number of speckles from the size of the scatterers was investigated for the light reflected from the surface with varying roughness; the single roughness on the surface was assumed to have the form of one-dimensional ‘pyramid’ with the sides having either linear or parabolic descent {{from the top of the}} ‘pyramid’ to the bottom. It was found that for the linear <b>roughness,</b> <b>number</b> of speckles decreased with increase of the roughness size, whereas for the parabolic roughness the number of speckles increased. Results of numerical simulation were compared with experiment investigations of roughness samples (0. 5 - 2. 5 ?m) made of glass and copper. Due to different production processes, the glass samples are likely to have the parabolic roughness and copper samples are likely to have the linear roughness. Experiments show that the dependences of number of speckles also have different slopes, the same as in numerical simulation.

40|$|Understanding the {{correlation}} between the mix proportions, micro structural characteristics, and macro-scale properties of concrete (i. e. the process-structure-properties relationship) is fundamental to achieving a more advanced understanding of how to apply and optimise this abundant engineering material. Although, concrete has been traditionally evaluated by its physico-mechanical and functional properties; development of advanced and effective inspection techniques during the last decade has demonstrated that fundamental macro-level properties of concrete depend, to a great extent, on its properties at the micro- and nano levels. This research was intended to make a quantitative assessment of impact load-induced micro-structural damage in concrete and, more particularly, to investigate the influence of ITZ micro-and nano local properties (as influenced by aggregate characteristics) on the impact load-induced cracking behaviour of concrete. Five different types of concrete mixtures were designed with the same total water cement ratio either by using natural aggregates as reference or by totally replacing the natural coarse aggregate with unconventional aggregates (such as copper slag, blue brick, sintered fly ash and tyre rubber) having significant differences in strength, shape and surface texture, porosity and roughness, and elasticity. A range of advanced techniques including X-ray diffraction, mercury porosimetry, 3 D X-ray computed tomography coupled with digital image analysis, laser surface profilometry, 3 D nanotech vertical scanning interferometry and scanning electron microscopy fitted with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer were used to characterize the aggregates and the concrete micro-structures. Based on the results obtained a possible mechanism for the micro-structural damage in concrete was proposed. Poorer aggregate characteristics alone could be responsible for a greater ITZ deterioration after loading but the results demonstrated that in fact, the aggregate causes a change in the ITZ conditions and it is these altered ITZ conditions that have a major effect on overall mix behaviour and govern the damaging process of concrete under impact loading. It was also concluded that the presence of a weak and porous ITZ has two opposite effects on the failure process. First, the chemical and porosity heterogeneities within the ITZ can cause fluctuations/disordering in the cracking (fracture) path, resulting in an increase in the tortuosity and corresponding fracture energy dissipation. Second, a weak and porous ITZ transfers less stress from the matrix to the aggregate particles. This leads to a lower compressive strength but increased toughness due to micro crack path lengthening and energy dissipation. Finally, the effect of the aggregate on the surface area roughness of the ITZ was established {{for the first time in}} the concrete literature. The <b>roughness</b> <b>number</b> of the area near the ITZ was found to positively correlate with dissipated surface fracture energy. An increase in the <b>roughness</b> <b>number</b> is associated with an increase in the dissipated fracture energy. The significance of this correlation however, lies in the fact that the rougher near – ITZ fraction of the bulk paste is more resistant to cracking at the macro level. Findings from this study will lead to a better understanding of the impact load-induced micro-structural damage phenomena. In addition, the micro-structural data from SEM and X-ray CT obtained during impact and mechanical testing of the concrete mixtures could be used to develop a multi-scale finite element model to simulate and predict the behaviour and fracture damage of concrete subjected to dynamic loading.

In this study, we tested the relevance of three formulations of the chronic detachment term in a simple model for the biomass dynamics of periphyton. Numerical simulations of the periphyton biomass dynamics were performed by using three different descriptors for the flow conditions: the discharge Q, the friction velocity u⁄, and the <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>number</b> k+ = u⁄ks/m (where m is water kinetic viscosity and ks is the Nikuradse equivalent sand roughness). Comparisons of numerical simulation results with experimental data from literature revealed chronic detachment to be better simulated by taking the <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>number</b> as the external variable of detachment. These results support the idea that transport phenomena that occur in the nearbed layer, e. g. chronic detachment of periphyton matter or vertical transport of nutrients and pollutants in submerged aquatic canopies, are not related to a single turbulence descriptor such as the friction velocity u⁄. Its description requires at least two descriptors, here the friction velocity u⁄ and the Nikuradse equivalent sand roughness ks, which depend on the initial form and dimensions of the colonized substratum, and its changes owing to the thickness, resistance, and composition of the epilithic matter...|$|R

40|$|The {{wave age}} {{dependency}} of the nondimensional sea surface roughness (also called the Charnock parameter) is investigated {{with data from}} the new field measurement program at Rødsand in the Danish Baltic Sea. An increasing Charnock parameter with inverse wave age is found, which can be described by a power-law relation. Friction velocity is a common quantity in both the Charnock parameter and wave age. Thus self-correlation effects are unavoidable in the relation between them. The significance of self-correlation is investigated by employing an artificial “dataset” with randomized wave parameters. It is found that self-correlation severely influences the relation. For the Rødsand dataset the difference between real and randomized “data” {{was found to be}} within the measurement uncertainty. By using a small subset of the data {{it was found that the}} importance of self-correlation increases for a narrower range of wave age values. This supports the conclusion of Johnson et al. that because of the scatter and self-correlation problems the coefficients of the power-law relation can only be obtained from the analysis of an aggregated dataset with a wide wave age range combining measurements from several sites. The dependency between wave age and sea roughness has been discussed extensively in the literature with different and sometimes conflicting results. A wide range of coefficients has been found for the power-law relation between the Charnock parameter and wave age for different datasets. It is shown that self-correlation contributes to such differences, since it depends on the range of wave age values present in the datasets. Also, data are often selected for rough flow conditions with the Reynolds <b>roughness</b> <b>number.</b> It is shown that for datasets with large scatter this can lead to misleading results with regard to the relationship between wave age and Charnock parameter.

In a society where a youthful appearance are an object of desire for consumers, and a source of commercial profit for cosmetic companies, this concept has a prominent role. In addition, perceived age is also an indicator of overall health status in elderly people, since old-looking people tend to show higher rates of morbidity and mortality. However, {{there is a lack of}} objective methods for quantifying perceived age. Methods: In order to satisfy the need of objective approaches for estimating perceived age, a novel algorithm was created. The novel algorithm uses supervised mathematical learning techniques and error retropropagation for the creation of an artificial neural network able to learn biophysical and clinically assessed parameters of subjects. The algorithm provides a consistent estimation of an individual&# 39;s perceived age, taking into account a defined set of facial skin phenotypic traits, such as wrinkles and <b>roughness,</b> <b>number</b> of wrinkles, depth of wrinkles, and pigmentation. A nonintervention, epidemiological cross-sectional study of cases and controls was conducted in 120 female volunteers for the diagnosis of perceived age using this novel algorithm. Data collection was performed by clinical assessment of an expert panel and biophysical assessment using the ANTERA 3 D® device. Results and discussion: Employing phenotype data as variables and expert assignments as objective data, the algorithm was found to correctly classify the samples with an accuracy of 92. 04 %. Therefore, we have developed a method for determining the perceived age of a subject in a standardized, consistent manner. Further application of this algorithm is thus a promising approach for the testing and validation of cosmetic treatments and aesthetic surgery, and it also could be used as a screening method for general health status in the population.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of the effectiveness of two-dimensional wire and three-dimensional grandular-type roughnesses for fixing transition on a 27 deg cone at a free-stream Mach number of 2. 20. One height of each type of roughness was investigated over a free-stream Reynolds number per foot range of about 1. 0 x 10 (exp 6) to 7. 0 x 10 (exp 6). The tests were made at an angle of attack of 0 deg and with essentially zero heat transfer. The results indicate that, within the Reynolds number per foot range investigated, both two-dimensional wire and three-dimensional granular types of roughness caused large forward movements of transition at constant Reynolds number per foot; however, the forward movement with increase in Reynolds number per foot was very slow for the two-dimensional wire roughness and transition never reached the roughness location as it did with the three-dimensional granular roughness. An extrapolated value of the <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>number</b> (based on <b>roughness</b> height and flow conditions at {{the outer edge of the}} roughness) for the first appearance of forward movement from the smooth-cone case for the three-dimensional granular roughness was in good agreement with the value of about 600 for the first appearance of turbulent bursts obtained on a similar cone by the hot-wire technique. The range of values of <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>number</b> for which a fully turbulent boundary layer existed in the vicinity of the roughness element was about 4, 500 to 6, 500...|$|R
40|$|This study covers {{pavement}} surface maintenance {{on three}} surface types: rigid, flexible and composite (asphalt overlay on rigid pavement). It addresses 3 main issues as follows: 1) Do routine maintenance activities {{make a difference}} in terms of pavement serviceability? If yes, how much? 2) Are chip and sand seal coating cost-effective? What is their optimal timing? 3) What management criteria should be used as a guide to make seal coating decisions on specific roadways? In resolving Issue # 1, a stratified 2 -stage sample of observational data was used in a statistical before/after comparison. SAS-General Linear Model was used due to its flexibility in treating continuous and class variables. Most activities showed significant effect (either alone or in combination with others) on Pavement Serviceability Ratings or <b>Roughness</b> <b>Numbers.</b> In resolving Issue Hi, Life Cycle Cost Analysis was applied using agency and user costs. Results showed that optimal timing for seal coating is in the PSI range of 3. 0 to 2. 7, dependent on AADT. In resolving Issue # 3, a literature search, telephone interviews and expert opinion survey were used to augment the findings on Issue # 2 in generating a decision tree. The developed tree uses the available data at INDOT, although surface distress related criteria would be superior. The tree helps analyze the likely cause of distress, the preferred solution and a priority ranking in the case of funding shortages. Specific guidelines or the use of chip and sand seals are also provided...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} investigation {{on the effects}} of roughness on heating in delta wing orbiters was conducted on the windward surface of the vehicle. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the feasibility of using parametric relationships obtained from discrete roughness effects on heating in flat plates and cones, to complex shuttle configurations. An attempt was also made to characterize what parameters were needed to influence roughness. Experimental results show that effective <b>roughness</b> Reynolds <b>numbers</b> are {{less than or equal to}} those of flat plates at the same edge Mach <b>number,</b> but, the <b>roughness</b> correlations for plates and cones cannot be applied to the shuttle configuration...|$|R
