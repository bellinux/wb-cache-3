40|$|A {{number of}} air traffic {{management}} decision support tools (DST) are being developed to help air traffic managers and controllers improve capacity, efficiency, and safety in the National Airspace System. Although DST functionality may vary widely, trajectory prediction algorithms {{can be found at}} the core of most DST. A methodology is presented for the automated statistical analysis of trajectory prediction accuracy as a function of phase of flight (level-flight, climb, descent) and look-ahead time. The methodology is focused on improving trajectory prediction algorithm performance for DST applications such as conflict detection and arrival metering. The methodology has been implemented in software and tested with air traffic data. Aggregate trajectory prediction accuracy statistics are computed and displayed in histogram format based on 2, 774 large commercial jet flights from five different days of Fort Worth Center air traffic data. The results show that trajectory prediction anomalies can be detected by examining error distributions for large numbers of trajectory predictions. The ability of the trajectory analysis methodology to detect the effects of subsequent changes to the trajectory prediction algorithm and to aircraft performance model parameters was also demonstrated.

In this paper, a new statistic of centripetal acceleration based on the radial velocity measurement is developed.

25|$|While color {{monitors}} {{had been}} used by several racing video games before (such as Indy 800 and Speed Race Twin), {{it was during this}} period that RGB color graphics became widespread, following the release of Galaxian in 1979. Namco's Rally-X in 1980 featured multi-directional scrolling, and introduced a <b>radar</b> <b>tracking</b> the player <b>position.</b> Sega's Space Tactics that year was a space combat game allowing multi-directional scrolling from a first-person perspective. The following year, Namco's Bosconian allowed the player's ship to freely move across open space that scrolls in all directions. By the early 1980s, scrolling had become popular among arcade video games and would make its way to third-generation consoles, where it would prove nearly as pivotal as the move to 3D graphics on later fifth-generation consoles.|$|R
25|$|Others tried new {{concepts}} and defined new genres. Rapidly evolving hardware allowed {{new kinds of}} games which allowed for different styles of gameplay. In 1980, Namco released Pac-Man, which popularized the maze chase genre, and Rally-X, which featured a <b>radar</b> <b>tracking</b> the player <b>position</b> on the map. Games such as the pioneering 1981 games Donkey Kong and Qix in 1981 introduced new types of games where skill and timing {{are more important than}} shooting as fast as possible, with Nintendo's Donkey Kong in particular setting the template for the platform game genre. Namco's Bosconian in 1981 introduced a free-roaming style of gameplay where the player's ship freely moves across open space, while also including a <b>radar</b> <b>tracking</b> player & enemy positions. Bega's Battle in 1983 introduced a new form of video game storytelling: using brief full-motion video cutscenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages. Other examples of innovative games are Atari Games' Paperboy in 1984 where the goal is to successfully deliver newspapers to customers, and Namco's Phozon where the object is to duplicate a shape shown {{in the middle of the}} screen. The theme of Exidy's Venture is dungeon exploration and treasure-gathering. One innovative game, Q*Bert, played upon the user's sense of depth perception to deliver a novel experience.|$|R
40|$|Command and Control {{system is}} a huge and complex system of systems. For its ability to improve the command and control {{efficiency}} and multiply operational capability, C 2 system investment is always a benchmark for military modernization. However, most of C 2 systems were independently developed, validated and approved as a stand-alone solution to reflect service requirement rather than joint focused. These stovepipe systems not only have an adverse impact on joint or coalition operation but also are fairly difficult to integrate and interoperate effectively with other systems. To promote the integration and interoperability between these stovepipe legacy systems, the paper applies XML standard to redefine the structured <b>radar</b> <b>track</b> and GPS <b>positioning</b> data formats whose original messaging formats are assumedly USMTF and GPRMC. And, we also implement <b>radar</b> <b>tracking</b> data and GPS positioning data generator to simulate air and land targets.

Sensors, GPS and intelligence Web Services including SOAP and WSDL are constructed to provide near real-time static intelligence and dynamic track information services. All relevant C 2 centers may subscribe the necessary services from the providers to work together with their own systems for mission needs.

From this, the firing angles (i. e. the angles w. r. t the laser guns) are calculated, and are corrected at discrete intervals of time (0. 1 s). Simulation results of the proposed concepts have demonstrated successful tracking of the target by the laser beams.

30|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>tracking</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the area of early warning and detection system, whose precision is closely connected with filtering algorithm. With the development of noise jamming technology in radar echo signal, linear filtering becomes more and more difficult to satisfy the demands of <b>radar</b> <b>tracking,</b> while nonlinear filtering can solve problems such as non-Gaussian noises. There exist a lot of nonlinear filtering algorithms at present, owning their particular characteristics. With this in mind, we provide a comprehensive overview of different nonlinear filtering algorithms in <b>radar</b> <b>tracking,</b> including basic ideas and concrete steps of them. For a more clear presentation, we also make comparisons of them from all sides. Through the analyses of different nonlinear data filters, we find that the unscented Kalman data filter (UKF) can achieve better performance than others. Therefore, we will simulate and show the performance of UKF, and performance of the extended Kalman data filter (EKF) under the same condition will be taken as comparison, whose accuracy was not ideal for <b>radar</b> <b>tracking</b> data filtering.|$|R

40|$|A certain {{problem in}} {{nonlinear}} estimation exists in <b>radar</b> <b>tracking.</b> Usually <b>radar</b> detec-tions provide instantaneous position measurements in radar (polar) coordinates at discrete times, while <b>tracks</b> (estimated <b>positions</b> and motions over continuous time) are deter-mined in rectangular coordinates; and the linear Kalman filter (LKF) {{is used as}} the esti-mator. Less common, the LKF is {{used to determine the}} <b>tracks</b> in <b>radar</b> coordinates, which are then converted into rectangular coordinates. Rarely is the extended Kalman filter (EKF) used, where the tracks are directly determined in rectangular coordinates from the radar detections via a local linearization. And so most <b>radar</b> <b>tracks</b> tend to be biased – and their Kalman covariance matrices are inconsistent with the true ones. Of course, some techniques have been proposed for “debiasing ” them and making their mean squared errors “consistent ” with the covariance matrices determined by the tracking filter. It is shown here, however, that the leading one for debiasing the LKF can make the biases worse; and a remedy for that is provided. But the focus is upon the EKF.
