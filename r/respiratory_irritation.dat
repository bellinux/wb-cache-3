As a result, wet cement is strongly caustic (water pH = 13.5) and can easily cause severe skin burns if not promptly washed off with water. Similarly, dry cement powder in contact with mucous membranes can cause severe eye or <b>respiratory</b> <b>irritation.</b> Some trace elements, such as chromium, from impurities naturally present in the raw materials used to produce cement may cause allergic dermatitis. Reducing agents such as ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) are often added to cement to convert the carcinogenic hexavalent chromate (CrO42−) into trivalent chromium (Cr3+), a less toxic chemical species. Cement users need also to wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing.|$|E

This model was validated through a robust series of experiments over two days and two nights in a real swimming pool. The model was found to satisfactorily predict variations over time in the concentrations of the chemical species investigated, including nitrogen trichloride. The work presented constitutes a first step to extend the model at different swimming pools.

40|$|International audienceIn water, {{chlorine}} {{reacts with}} nitrogen-containing compounds to produce disinfection byproducts such as nitrogen trichloride which induces ocular and <b>respiratory</b> <b>irritations</b> in swimming pool workers. A technical solution {{has been used}} to reduce NCl 3 exposure to acceptable levels, by adding a stripping step to the water recycling loop. The pollutants extracted are currently rejected into the atmosphere without treatment. However, the physical properties of NCl 3 could be harnessed to induce its controlled degradation by direct or indirect light. This paper describes the way to transform NCl 3 into oxidizing chlorine by photocatalysis under laboratory conditions. Photocatalytic oxidation efficiently degrades gaseous nitrogen trichloride, producing compounds such as HClO. About 60 % of NCl 3 decomposed was converted into HClO which {{could be used as a}} disinfection compound. A kinetic model is proposed for the photocatalytic process based on a convection/diffusion model. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood model was applied to the chemical part of the mechanism. The apparent quantum yield was also estimated to assess the optimal irradiance for NCl 3 transformation. The results show that photocatalysis performs much better than photolysis alone for NCl 3 removal, i. e. at least 25 times more efficient...|$|R

40|$|Shallow, well-illuminated {{coastal waters}} from {{tropical}} to temperate latitudes are attractive environments for humans. Beaches and coral reefs have provided lodging and food to coastal communities for centuries. Unfortunately, tropical regions traditionally have been threatened by outbreaks of the toxic benthic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus, which {{is associated with}} ciguatera fish poisoning. The ciguatoxins produced by Gambierdiscus bioaccumulate in reef fishes and {{are responsible for the}} most common algal toxin-related illnesses, globally affecting the greatest number of victims and often with significant long-term health effects. Recently, Gambierdiscus has been documented in subtropical and temperate latitudes. Blooms of another benthic and toxic dinoflagellate, Ostreopsis, have become more frequent and intense, especially in temperate waters. Ostreopsis produces palytoxins and analogues, and some outbreaks have been associated with massive benthic faunal damage and <b>respiratory</b> <b>irritations</b> in humans exposed to aerosols. The increased frequency of harmful events and the biogeographic extension of benthic microalgae incentivized the launch of the Global Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms (GEOHAB) Core Research Project on “Benthic Harmful Algal Blooms” in 2010. This article summarizes the main scientific advances and gaps in related knowledge as well as advances the project has made toward managing and mitigating the impacts of benthic HABs on human illnesses and marine resource losses.
