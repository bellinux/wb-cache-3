40|$|Tumors {{occur in}} all {{domestic}} and wild animals. They {{are most often}} diagnosed in dogs and cats, and their numbers increase from year to year. In the recent years, cancer {{is believed to be}} the most frequent cause of pet deaths. A speedy and reliable diagnosis is of paramount importance because it enables the veterinarian to begin therapy and make a prognosis. The objective of an early diagnosis is to enable the detection of neoplastic diseases before the tumor spreads throughout the organism, consequently enabling the timely administration of therapy and providing greater chances for curing the animal. A tumor is diagnosed on the grounds of the anamnesis, clinical picture, and special diagnostic procedures. The most frequently applied diagnostic procedures are laboratory diagnostics, cytology, biopsy and pathohistology, imaging diagnostics (roentgenography and <b>roentgenoscopy,</b> ultrasound diagnostics, endoscopy, computer tomography, magnetic resonance, and scintigraphy) and molecular diagnostics. Each of these methods has its advantages and faults in connection with costs, availability, sensitivity, specificity and quality of anatomic vs functional pictures. Every one of these techniques has its own field of implementation and each one provides different and additional information in connection with the nature and position of the primary lesion and the presence of metastases...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} aimed at {{methodology}} development for collective risk assessment of medical irradiation, basing on results of radiation-hygienic passportization in the Russian Federation regions, i. e. using values of collective effective doses for big groups of medical technologies: photoroentgenography, roentgenography, <b>roentgenoscopy,</b> and computer tomography. Use of the effective dose concept for medical irradiation risk definition involves a number of essential restrictions. Age and sex of the employees and of general population (effective dose concept has been developed for these groups of people) may essentially differ from those in patients. Lifelong risk of stochastic effects occurrence in children is 2 - 3 {{times higher than the}} rating values used in effective dose concept, while for elderly people (about 60 years at irradiation time) it’s 4 - 5 times lower.  The article suggests the algorithm of effective doses values correcting factors assessment for consideration of dependence of radiogenic cancer risk factors on age and sex. This enables to assess more correctly collective risk of radiology and nuclear medicine imaging. Since patients tend to be elderly and their risk factor is below the rating used in the effective dose concept, the values of these correcting factors for most radiology and nuclear medicine imaging are below one. Thus, in most cases, the effective dose concept leads to conservative assessment of medical irradiation collective risk. </p...|$|E
40|$|IN {{spite of}} the loing {{interest}} in tricuspid valve disease, {{review of the literature}} shows a relatively small numl) er of reports about the incidence of functional trictuspid insuifficiency. Coelho 1 fouind tricuspid regurgitation in 20 per cent of 620 patients with mitral valve dis-ease. Earlier, Mackenzie 2 and, later, Miiller and Shillingford 3 claimed that fu. nctional in-competence of the tricuspid valve appears quite oftein, but organic incompetence is rare. 4 Studies of the right atrial pressure-pulse in proved fuinctional tricuispid regurgitation and sinus rhythm are exceedingly scarce. Wood ' stated "good jugular or right atrial pressure pulse tracings in fuinctional tricuspid regurgi-tation and normal sinus rhythm are rare. " This paper presenits a study of the right atrial pressure pulse in six patients having functional tricuspid regurgitation and normal sinuis rhythm. Materials and Methods This study was performed on six patien-ts with rheumatic heart disease. Fouir were women and two were men. Their ages ranged between 16 and 32 years. All were found to be in functional class III. 6 Twelve-lead electrocardiograms and complete <b>roentgenoscopy</b> and roentgenography were ob-tained. Phonocardiograms were recorded from the apex of the heart anid the fourth left intercostal space with a Saniborn twini-beam phonocardio-graph (model 62). All the logarithmic phonocar-diograms were recorded during the inspiratory and the expiratory phases of respiration. Five of th...|$|E
