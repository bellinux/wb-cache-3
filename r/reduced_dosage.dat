Combination of HC/AMB appears to involve the disruption of cell membrane structure that cause rapid leakage of monovalent ions allows the passage of one or both agents. Thus, the synergism effect was observed in this combination.|$|R

40|$|Responsiveness to <b>reduced</b> <b>dosage</b> of {{rituximab}} in Chinese {{patients with}} neuromyelitis optica Objective: To determine {{the effect of}} a lower dose of rituximab in depleting B lymphocytes, main-taining low B-cell counts, and relapse in patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and NMO spec-trum disorders. Methods:We treated 5 Chinese patientswith deterioratingNMOandNMOspectrumdisorders with a 100 -mg IV infusion of rituximab once a week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by additional infusion of the same dosage depending on circulating B-cell repopulation. Results: This <b>reduced</b> <b>dosage</b> of rituximab was sufficient to deplete B cells and maintain low B-cell counts. None of the treated patients experienced relapse, and all patients exhibited stabilized or improved neurologic function during the 1 -year follow-up period. MRI revealed the absence of new lesions, no enhancement in spinal cord and brain, a significant shrinkage of spinal cord segments, and a reduction/disappearance of previous brain lesions. Conclusion: A lower dosage of rituximab may be sufficient in depleting B cells, maintaining low B-cell counts, and preventing disease progression in Chinese patients with NMO.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{investigation}} of gene dosage at 9 p 21. 3 and mutations in BRAF and NRAS, as predictors of relapse and histological markers of poor melanoma prognosis. Formalin-fixed primary melanomas from 74 relapsed and 42 nonrelapsed patients were sequenced for common BRAF and NRAS mutations (N = 71 results) and gene dosage at 9 p 21. 3 including the genes CDKN 2 A (which encodes CDKN 2 A and P 14 ARF), CDKN 2 B (CDKN 2 B), and MTAP was measured using multiplexed ligation-dependant probe amplification (MLPA), (N = 75 results). BRAF/NRAS mutations were detected in 77 % of relapsers and 58 % of nonrelapsers (Fisher's exact P = 0. 17), and did not predict ulceration or mitotic rate. There was no relationship between BRAF/NRAS mutations and gene dosage at 9 p 21. 3. <b>Reduced</b> gene <b>dosage</b> at MTAP showed a borderline association with BRAF mutation (P = 0. 04) and <b>reduced</b> gene <b>dosage</b> at the interferon gene cluster was borderline associated with wild type NRAS (P = 0. 05). <b>Reduced</b> gene <b>dosage</b> in the CDKN 2 A regions coding for CDKN 2 A was {{associated with an increased}} risk of relapse (P = 0. 03). <b>Reduced</b> gene <b>dosage</b> across 9 p 21. 3 was associated with increased tumor thickness, mitotic rate, and ulceration (P = 0. 02, 0. 02, and 0. 002, respectively), specifically in coding regions impacting on CDKN 2 B and P 14 ARF and CDKN 2 A. Loss at MTAP (P = 0. 05) and the interferon gene cluster (P = 0. 03) on 9 p 21 was also associated with tumor ulceration. There was no association between <b>reduced</b> gene <b>dosage</b> at 9 p 21. 3 and subtype or site of tumor. This study presents supportive evidence that CDKN 2 B, P 14 ARF, and CDKN 2 A may all play a tumor suppressor role in melanoma progression. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{shattered}} 1 (shtd 1) mutation disrupts Drosophila compound eye structure. In this report, we {{show that}} the shtd 1 eye defects are due to a failure {{to establish and maintain}} G 1 arrest in the morphogenetic furrow (MF) and a defect in progression through mitosis. The observed cell cycle defects were correlated with an accumulation of cyclin A (CycA) and String (Stg) proteins near the MF. Interestingly, the failure to maintain G 1 arrest in the MF led to the specification of R 8 photoreceptor cells that undergo mitosis, generating R 8 doublets in shtd 1 mutant eye discs. We demonstrate that shtd encodes Apc 1, the largest subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Furthermore, {{we show that}} <b>reducing</b> the <b>dosage</b> of either CycA or stg suppressed the shtd 1 phenotype. While <b>reducing</b> the <b>dosage</b> of CycA is more effective in suppressing the premature S phase entry in the MF, <b>reducing</b> the <b>dosage</b> of stg is more effective in suppressing the progression through mitosis defect. These results indicate the importance of not only G 1 arrest in the MF but also appropriate progression through mitosis for normal eye development during photoreceptor differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Idiopathic {{ulcerative}} colitis primarily affects young adults. Colonic symptoms {{are the most}} annoying. In severe colitis, systemic and extraintestinal inflammatory manifestations can be disabling. Proximal extension of colitis is demonstrated by double-contrast barium enema and total colonoscopy. Bacterial and parasitic colitis must be excluded by appropriate microbiological studies. Colonoscopy is recommended to screen for high-grade dysplasia or neoplasia in cases of chronic diffuse colitis (after seven years). Severe colitis can benefit from hospitalization, parenteral nutritional support, and high doses of corticosteroids that are progressively tapered. Mild or moderate cases or severe cases in remission respond well to rest, low-irritant diets, mild symptomatic medication, oral sulfasalazine, or more recent 5 -acetylsalicylic derivatives. Long-term maintenance with <b>reduced</b> <b>dosages</b> will control more than 80 % of cases...|$|R

40|$|This Experiment was {{arranged}} as a strip-plot {{on the base}} of a completely randomized block design with three replications to study the effect of tillage (whether in day or night or in day by light-proof cover) and application of <b>reduced</b> <b>dosage</b> of imazethapyr and trifluralin on weed control, yield and yield components of chickpea. Main plots consisted of tillage methods and subplots consisted of trifluralin (at doses of 480, 960 and 1440 g ai /ha) and imazethapyr (at doses of 50, 100 and 150 g ai /ha), plus weed free and weedy checks. Results showed weed biomass in day tillage, night tillage and in light-proof cover tillage were respectively 86, 127 and 148 g m- 2. Therefore tillage at night or by light-proof cover in day time showed not enough efficiency in weed control. Weed biomass increased when application dose of herbicides decreased. Chickpea grain yield showed significant differences when different doses of herbicides applied. The minimum and the maximum seed yield were obtained respectively in weed free (by 208 g m- 2) and weedy checks (by 123 g m- 2). <b>Reduced</b> <b>dosage</b> of imazethapyr and trifluralin could control weeds good enough by no significant decrease in chickpea yield.

Numerical simulation conducted in this paper shows that (i) the tumor can be regulated by administering CD 4 + T cells alone in a patient with a strong immune system or who has been diagnosed at an early stage, (ii) immunotherapy with a large amount of an antitumor cytokine can boost the immune system to remit or even to suppress tumor cells completely, and (iii) through polytherapy the tumor can be kept at a smaller size with <b>reduced</b> <b>dosages...</b>|$|R
