5|$|In 1961, he was {{commissioned}} {{to design the}} Catholic-based Nanzan University in Nagoya. It {{was one of the}} largest projects that he would undertake. The campus was orientated on a north–south axis across <b>rolling</b> <b>hills</b> and the eight buildings were arranged to suit the typography and harmonise with the landscape. In-situ concrete is used throughout the scheme and each building has its own concrete form, some with pilotis, others with shells.|$|E

5|$|An {{automatic}} {{traffic monitoring}} and guidance {{system is in}} place along the motorway. It consists of measuring, control and signalling devices located in zones where driving conditions may vary, such as at interchanges, viaducts, bridges, tunnels and zones where fog and strong wind are known to occur. The system uses variable traffic signs to communicate changing driving conditions, possible restrictions and other information to motorway users. The A2 motorway mainly runs through the plains and <b>rolling</b> <b>hills</b> of Hrvatsko Zagorje region, although the northernmost sections of the route traverse rugged terrain, requiring a number of viaducts and long tunnels along the route.|$|E

5|$|Oakwood was {{designed}} by John C.

The plan consisted of roads, man-made lakes, dense vegetation, and <b>rolling</b> <b>hills,</b> covering about , including the modern sections A through Q. Sidney also designed the original superintendent's house and receiving tomb, neither of which exist today. For all Sidney's extensive planning, the first plots were laid out in a seemingly haphazard manner by the first superintendent, Robert Fergusson.|$|E

5|$|Two Rivers is {{the final}} {{checkpoint}} in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route.
