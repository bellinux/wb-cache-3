30|$|Each fuel {{combustion}} experiment lasted for 90  min, {{during which the}} engine <b>rpm</b> <b>changed</b> a bit. Since the change was insignificant, however, {{it was assumed that}} the regular distribution of the engine speed was constant for each fuel over 3600  rpm. Thereafter, T-test was conducted to verify the significance of difference in arithmetic means values of the driving and exhaust characteristics of the measured variables. As for other measurements, to overview general tendency as well as the descriptive statistics for each fuel type, a hypothesis for a further statistical analysis, based on the bivariate correlation, was established.|$|R
30|$|As {{the plate}} is pre-contoured, {{it does not}} seat equally well in all {{patients}} and bending the plate can potentially damage the locking hole screw threads and can also <b>change</b> the <b>screw</b> direction to a certain extent.

To circumvent this problem, plate bending should be done after blocking the screw holes with locking sleeves and bending the plate only in between the screw holes.|$|R

40|$|A bubble {{trapped in}} the liquid {{manifold}} of INTELSAT IV F- 7 spacecraft caused a mass imbalance between the System 1 propellant tanks and a wobble half angle of 0. 38 degree to 0. 48 degree. A maneuver in May 14, 1980 passed the bubble through the axial jet and allowed propellant to redistribute. A 0. 2 <b>rpm</b> <b>change</b> in spin rate was observed with an exponential decay time constant of 6 minutes. In this paper, moment of inertia, tank geometry and hydrodynamics models are derived to match the observed spin rate data. The values of the total mass of the propellant considered were 16, 19 and 20 Kgs with corresponding mass imbalances of 14. 3, 15 and 15. 1 Kgs, respectively.

30|$|More generally, for an {{irregular}}-paced signal model such as Eq.  37 a, {{time warping}} as in Eq.  37 b affects the pacemaker’s rate and, as desired, can convert the irregular pulse-times of occurrence to regular pulse-angles (in {{the case of}} rotating machinery) of occurrence {θ_n}={ 2 π n+θ_∗}; but, Eq.  37 b also reveals that this time warping also affects the time scale of the individual paced pulses or bursts {q_n(t)}={q_n(ψ^- 1 (θ))}{q̃_n(θ)} and the warped pulses {q̃_n(θ)} are no longer identically distributed. Consequently, neither the irregular-paced signal nor the time-warped regular-paced signal are cyclostationary. This is particularly important {{to the study of}} rotating machinery vibrations when the RPM (meaning revolutions per minute or rotations per minute) varies with time too fast to be treated in the data analysis as locally constant (meaning all vibration transients—e.g., from machine faults—have died away before the <b>RPM</b> <b>changes</b> substantially, in which case quasi-static approximations can yield accurate results).|$|R

The lathes were based on the design of the very successful American South Bend Lathe models.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} for machine fault detection from vibration data collected at variable load conditions of a system. Although load variation is a common phenomena in real industry, most of the traditional fault detection techniques fails to take this load variability into account while analyzing vibration data. Plant loads and machine <b>rpm</b> <b>change</b> have a significant influence on the vibration data and to address this fact accurately, amultivariate technique combiningMultiscale PCA (MSPCA) andMultiway PCA (MPCA) is presented here. The methodology takes the powerful data signature extraction feature of Wavelet Transform (WT) and strong fault detection ability of PCA and integrate them with the multiple conditions monitoring ability of MPCA. Another significant feature of this proposed multiscale MPCA technique is that it combines the process variables with the vibration analysis. An advanced simulation system of bearing fault at variable loads is presented and the methodology is used on the acquired simulated data. The results are presented along with a comparison with a conventional technique. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on a DC motor experimental setup...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} thrust-response {{characteristics}} on helicopter handling qualities have until recently remained largely undefined. A multiphase program is being conducted to study, in a generic sense and through ground simulation, {{the effects of}} engine and rotor response characteristics, excess power, and vertical damping on specific maneuvers included in nap-of-the-earth (NOE) operations. This paper describes the most recent of these phases: a simulation in which the effects on handling qualities of rotor inertia and <b>rpm</b> <b>changes</b> were considered. Thrust- and height-response characteristics to step-control inputs are included to document the configurations investigated. Results indicate that with a given engine response and unlimited power, large changes in rotor inertia have little effect on handling qualities for certain low-speed tasks and hover tasks. The effects on handling qualities of requiring the pilot to maintain proper rotor rpm limits were also studied. This investigation revealed that large fluctuations in rotor rpm degrade handling qualities; as a result, continued study {{of the use of}} methods to automate control of rotor rpm is recommended...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} Department of Energy (DOE) {{project is}} to {{increase}} wind turbine efficiency and reliability {{with the use of}} a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system. The LIDAR provides wind speed and direction data that can be used to help mitigate the fatigue stress on the turbine blades and internal components caused by wind gusts, sub-optimal pointing and reactionary speed or <b>RPM</b> <b>changes.</b> This effort will have a significant impact on the operation and maintenance costs of turbines across the industry. During the course of the project, Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) modified and tested a prototype direct detection wind LIDAR instrument; the resulting LIDAR design considered all aspects of wind turbine LIDAR operation from mounting, assembly, and environmental operating conditions to laser safety. Additionally, in co-operation with our partners, the National Renewable Energy Lab and the Colorado School of Mines, progress was made in LIDAR performance modeling as well as LIDAR feed forward control system modeling and simulation. The results of this investigation showed that using LIDAR measurements to change between baseline and extreme event controllers in a switching architecture can reduce damage equivalent loads on blades and tower, and produce higher mean power output due to fewer overspeed events.

40|$|ActiGraph accelerometers are {{a useful}} tool for {{objective}} assessment of physical activity in clinical and epidemiological studies. Several generations of ActiGraph are being used; however, little work has been done to verify that measurements are consistent across generations. This study employed mechanical oscillations to characterize the dynamic response and intermonitor variability of three generations of ActiGraph monitors, from the oldest 7164 (n = 13), 71256 (n = 12), to the newest GT 1 M (n = 12). The response due to independent radius (22. 1 – 60. 4 mm) and frequency (25 – 250 <b>rpm)</b> <b>changes</b> were measured, as well as intermonitor variability within each generation. The 7164 and 71256 have similar relationships between activity counts and radius (P = 0. 229) but were significantly different from the GT 1 M (P < 0. 001). The frequency responses were nonlinear in all three generations. Although the response curve shapes were similar, the differences between generations at various frequencies were significant (P < 0. 017), especially in the extremes of the measurement range. Intermonitor variability was markedly reduced in the GT 1 M compared with the 7164 and 71256. Other measurement differences between generations include decreased peak counts and decreased sensitivity in low-frequency detection in the GT 1 M. The results of this study revealed an improvement of the intermonitor variability by the GT 1 M monitor. However, the reduced sensitivity in low-count ranges in the GT 1 M may not be well suited for monitoring sedentary or light-intensity movements. Furthermore, the algorithms for energy expenditure predictions developed using older 7164 monitors may need to be modified for the GT 1 M...|$|R
