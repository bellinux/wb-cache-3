40|$|The {{putative}} RNA helicase encoded by the Arabidopsis gene At 1 g 32490 is a homolog of {{the yeast}} splicing RNA helicases Prp 2 and Prp 22. We isolated a temperature-sensitive allele (rsw 12) {{of the gene}} in a screen for root <b>radial</b> <b>swelling</b> mutants. Plants containing this allele grown at the restrictive temperature showed weak <b>radial</b> <b>swelling,</b> were stunted with reduced root elongation, and contained reduced levels of cellulose. The role of the protein was further explored by microarray analysis. By using both fold change cutoffs and a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to investigate coexpression of genes, {{we found that the}} <b>radial</b> <b>swelling</b> phenotype was not linked to genes usually associated with primary cell wall biosynthesis. Instead, the mutation has strong effects on expression of secondary cell wall related genes. Many genes potentially associated with secondary walls were present in the most significant WGCNA module, as were genes coding for arabinogalactans and proteins with GPI anchors. The proportion of up-regulated genes that possess introns in rsw 12 was above that expected if splicing was unrelated to the activity of the RNA helicase, suggesting that the helicase does indeed play a role in splicing in Arabidopsis. The phenotype may be due to a change in the expression of one or more genes coding for cell wall proteins...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTwo {{small-scale}} mock-up {{tests were}} carried out on a compacted mixture of bentonite and sand, one with saturation from the bottom only {{and the other with}} saturation from the top and bottom. Swelling pressure was monitored at different positions of the soil sample in both axial and radial directions. Results showed that the two-side saturation accelerates the swelling pressure kinetics by a factor of 4. The <b>radial</b> <b>swelling</b> pressure kinetics depends on the soil swelling, soil collapse, and interaction between the soil layers. Further analysis based on the relative humidity measurements in an infiltration test performed previously showed that the variations of swelling pressure with suction are similar to those found in literature, and that threshold points exist indicating the initiation of soil collapse. These threshold points appeared at higher suction when the soil was farther from the wetting face. The failure of the axial confining elements in the storage galleries was also simulated by releasing the piston and allowing a limited axial swelling of 20 %. The <b>radial</b> <b>swelling</b> pressures decreased sharply upon the piston release and during the free axial swelling. A swelling pressure gradient was found from the bottom to the top with a higher value at the bottom. The density gradient was estimated based on the swelling pressure profile...|$|E

40|$|Although wood {{densification}} by compression improves wood mechanical strength, {{dimensional stability}} {{is often a}} problem due to compression recovery. Alternatively, oil-heat treatment (OHT) improves wood dimensional stability and enhances resistance to biological attack. This study examined combined wood densification and OHT. Large wood veneer 700 × 700 mm specimens prepared with aspen (Populus tremuloides) were densified using heat, steam, and pressure at 160 ºC, 180 ºC, and 200 °C, respectively. OHT at 180 ºC, 200 ºC, and 220 ºC for 1, 2, and 3 h was then applied to the densified veneers. Results show that OHT efficiently improved dimensional stability and reduced compression set recovery. OHT temperature and duration markedly influenced the reduction of compression set recovery: the higher the OHT temperature and duration, the lower the recovery. Less than 5 % recovery was obtained under various OHT conditions, and almost 0 % recovery under some OHT conditions. <b>Radial</b> and tangential <b>swellings</b> of densified veneers were reduced dramatically. Compared to OHT duration, OHT temperature had a pronounced higher impact on <b>radial</b> and tangential <b>swelling.</b> Irreversible swelling (IS) in the compression direction of densified veneers decreased after OHT, particularly with high temperature and long duration, and anti-swelling efficiency (ASE) in the compression direction improved significantly...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that cell elongation is regulated by cortical microtubules, which guide {{the movement of}} cellulose synthase complexes as they secrete cellulose microfibrils into the periplasmic space. Transversely oriented microtubules are predicted to direct the deposition of a parallel array of microfibrils, thus generating a mechanically anisotropic cell wall that will favor elongation and prevent <b>radial</b> <b>swelling.</b> Thus far, support for this model has been most convincingly demonstrated in filamentous algae. We found that in etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls, microtubules and cellulose synthase trajectories are transversely oriented on the outer surface of the epidermis for only a short period during growth and that anisotropic growth continues after this transverse organization is lost. Our data support previous findings that the outer epidermal wall is polylamellate in structure, {{with little or no}} anisotropy. By contrast, we observed perfectly transverse microtubules and microfibrils at the inner face of the epidermis during all stages of cell expansion. Experimental perturbation of cortical microtubule organization preferentially at the inner face led to increased <b>radial</b> <b>swelling.</b> Our study highlights the previously underestimated complexity of cortical microtubule organization in the shoot epidermis and underscores a role for the inner tissues in the regulation of growth anisotropy...|$|E

The system's feedback capability allowed continuous control of a constant tip load, and the attached displacement transducer provided the time course of root elongation. Loads up to 7. 5 g decreased the root elongation rate by 0. 13 mm h- 1 g- 1, but loads 7. 5 to 17. 5 g decreased the growth rate by only 0. 04 mm h- 1 g- 1. Loads higher than 18 g stopped root elongation completely. Measurement of the cross-sectional areas of the root tips indicated that the 18 g load had applied about 0. 98 MPa of axial pressure to the root, thereby exceeding the root's ability to respond with increased turgor pressure.

In dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings, exogenous ethylene treatment triggers an exaggeration of the apical hook, the inhibition of both hypocotyl and root elongation, and <b>radial</b> <b>swelling</b> of the hypocotyl. These features are predominantly based on the differential cell elongation in different cells/tissues mediated by an auxin gradient. Interestingly, the physiological responses regulated by ethylene and auxin crosstalk can be either additive or synergistic, as in primary root and root hair elongation, or antagonistic, as in hypocotyl elongation. This review focuses on the crosstalk of these two hormones at the seedling stage.

40|$|As {{critical}} {{determinants of}} growth anisotropy in plants, cortical microtubules {{are thought to}} constrain the movement of cellulose synthase complexes and thus align newly deposited cellulose microfibrils. We tested this cellulose synthase constraint model using the temperature-sensitive mor 1 - 1 mutant of Arabidopsis. Contrary to predictions, the disruption of cortical microtubules in mor 1 - 1 root epidermal cells led to left-handed root twisting and <b>radial</b> <b>swelling</b> but did not alter the transverse orientation of cellulose microfibrils. We also found that drug-dependent disassembly or hyperstabilization of cortical microtubules did not alter the parallel order of cellulose microfibrils. By measuring cellulose content in mor 1 - 1 seedlings, we verified that cellulose synthesis is not reduced at the restrictive temperature.

Following a complex induction period which lasts about 3 hours, a low, but steady-state growth rate is achieved. Ethylene removal experiments indicate that the gas induces an irreversible change in the cell expansion mode.

If the gas was removed during an intermediate phase, that intermediate rate of growth continued after removal. In other experiments, segments were incubated with intact apical hooks and the induction period was much shorter than with isolated segments. Changes in imino acid metabolism have been correlated with the induction of swelling.

40|$|To {{identify}} {{novel and}} essential {{components of the}} plant membrane trafficking mechanisms, Arabidopsis membrane trafficking mutants from fluorescent protein-based forward genetic screens were characterized. First, four novel glutathione synthase (GSH 2) mutant alleles featured swollen endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -derived bodies that accumulated a soluble secretory marker. Consistent {{with the role of}} GSH 2 in glutathione biosynthesis, the loss-of-function mutant alleles exhibited gamma-glutamylcysteine (γ-EC) hyperaccumulation and glutathione deficiency. The aberrant ER morphology was ascribed to the γ-EC accumulation. Redox-sensitive fluorescent protein revealed that gsh 2 seedlings maintained a reduced cytoplasm at steady state but were more sensitive to oxidative challenge. Second, Mut 21 was a conditional mutant that accumulated a secretory marker in the alkalized apoplast at restrictive temperature (31 ˚C). The mutant was identified as carrying a mutant allele of tuftelin-interacting protein 11 (TFIP 11), which has been implicated in regulating redifferentiation and cell proliferation through a cytokinin signalling pathway. Hence, it was postulated that the changes in response to cytokinin affect auxin-mediated acidification of the apoplast. Third, Mut 43 was a conditional mutant that accumulated a soluble secretory marker in the ER and unidentified punctate structures at restrictive temperature, and exhibited perturbations in ER export of a soluble protein marker. Moreover, the mutant showed severe growth defects and abnormal <b>radial</b> root <b>swelling</b> in the apical elongation zone. A mutation identification method through deep-sequencing of the wild-type siblings in outcrossed heterozygous mutant families was developed and tested in Mut 43. At the time when this thesis was prepared, bioinformatic analysis has assigned Mut 43 to the bottom arm of chromosome two and predicted a 300 kb mapping interval based on the observed bias in single nucleotide polymorphism ratios.

At high magnification, pores are surrounded by a low density halo (< 100 nm) and are coated by a high density wall (< 50 nm) enriched in U or Ca or both. We interpret the spatial link between U, Ca and porosity as evidence for U uptake. Alteration of euxenite crystals into pyrochlore in the rock led to liberation of U and Ca. These elements were transported by fluids through cracks and incorporated within zircon thanks to porosity by a diffusion–reaction process.

The tangential, <b>radial</b> and longitudinal <b>swelling</b> was measured and volumetric swelling of oven-dried samples was determined. The synergic effects of swelling in aqueous solutions were observed. The properties of binary liquid systems have a major influence on the swelling of wood. Microscopy studies of wood samples show that after swelling in water the cells are densely packed and the compound middle lamellae (CML) has arranged in a form of continuous ribbon around the cells. The swelling of wood in ethanol-water mixtures has a dramatic effect on the wood structure through dissolving a main part of lignin from CML and released individual cells at sectioning. Acetone and acetone-water mixtures have an insignificant effect on the cell wall structure and its bonding to the CML.

The first type of device, consisting of naturally derived products, includes the Laminaria tent, which is made from the stems of Laminaria japonica or Laminaria digitata (brown sea weed), and is the type most commonly used. It swells in the presence of liquid and ripens the cervix physically and chemically, by exerting a <b>radial</b> force during <b>swelling,</b> and this outward pressure stimulates the release of F-class prostaglandins, achieving a clinical effect in between 3 and 24  h [16, 17]. The second and third types of osmotic dilators are synthetic ones with the potential advantages of assured sterility, consistency of length and shape, and, theoretically, greater predictability of effect. The second type of device, e.g. Dilapan, is a synthetic hygroscopic polyacrylonitrile (hypan plastic polymer) rod-shaped dilator, acting primarily mechanically and having a notable clinical effect within 2 – 4  h [18]. The third type is Lamicel, a sterile, polyvinyl sponge impregnated with magnesium sulphate, which can reversibly decouple collagen cross-linkages in cervical stroma and increase sensitivity to prostaglandin E 2 [19]. The predominant chemical action with no outward pressure on the cervical wall permits it to be placed into a narrow, stenotic cervix and swell with a minor hourglass effect [20]. These osmotic dilators have been used to ripen the cervix for induced abortion as well as to overcome stenosis in non-pregnant women requiring hysteroscopy [13 – 15, 17 – 19].|$|R

The DRP 1 family of Arabidopsis thaliana has {{five members of}} which DRP 1 A, DRP 1 C, and DRP 1 E are widely expressed. Likely functions of DRP 1 A were identified by studying rsw 9, a null mutant of the Columbia ecotype that grows continuously but with altered morphology. Mutant roots and hypocotyls are short and swollen, features plausibly originating in their cellulose-deficient walls. The reduction in cellulose is specific since non-cellulosic polysaccharides in rsw 9 have more arabinose, xylose, and galactose than those in wild type. Cell plates in rsw 9 roots lack DRP 1 A but still retain DRP 1 E. Abnormally placed and often incomplete cell walls are preceded by abnormally curved cell plates. Notwithstanding these division abnormalities, roots and stems add new cells at wild-type rates and organ elongation slows because rsw 9 cells do not grow as long as wild-type cells. Absence of DRP 1 A reduces endocytotic uptake of FM 4 - 64 into the cytoplasm of root cells and the hypersensitivity of elongation and <b>radial</b> <b>swelling</b> in rsw 9 to the trafficking inhibitor monensin suggests that impaired endocytosis {{may contribute to the}} development of shorter fatter roots, probably by reducing cellulose synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Rhamnogalacturonan (RG) I is a {{branched}} pectic polysaccharide {{in plant}} cell walls. Rhamnogalacturonan lyase (eRGL) from Aspergillus aculeatus {{is able to}} cleave the RG I backbone at specific sites. Transgenic potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants {{were made by the}} introduction of the gene encoding eRGL, {{under the control of the}} granule-bound starch synthase promoter. The eRGL protein was successfully expressed and translated into an active form, demonstrated by eRGL activity in the tuber extracts. The transgenic plants produced tubers with clear morphological alterations, including <b>radial</b> <b>swelling</b> of the periderm cells and development of intercellular spaces in the cortex. Sugar compositional analysis of the isolated cell walls showed a large reduction in galactosyl and arabinosyl residues in transgenic tubers. Immunocytochemical studies using the LM 5 (galactan) and LM 6 (arabinan) antibodies also showed a large reduction in galactan and arabinan side-chains of RG I. Most of the remaining LM 5 epitopes were located in the expanded middle lamella at cell corners of eRGL tubers, which is in contrast to their normal location in the primary wall of wild type tubers. These data suggest that RG I has an important role in anchoring galactans and arabinans at particular regions in the wall and in normal development of the periderm...|$|E
40|$|In plant cells, glycans {{attached}} to asparagine (N) residues of proteins undergo various modifications in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The N-glycan modifications in the Golgi apparatus result in complex N-glycans {{attached to}} membrane proteins, secreted proteins and vacuolar proteins. Recently, we {{have investigated the}} role of complex N-glycans in plants using a series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants affected in complex N-glycan biosynthesis. 1 Several mutant plants including complex glycan 1 (cgl 1) displayed a salt-sensitive phenotype during their root growth, which was associated with <b>radial</b> <b>swelling</b> and loss of apical dominance. Among the proteins whose N-glycans {{are affected by the}} cgl 1 mutation is a membrane anchored β 1, 4 -endoglucanase, KORRIGAN 1 /RADIALLY SWOLLEN 2 (KOR 1 /RSW 2) involved in cellulose biosynthesis. The cgl 1 mutation strongly enhanced the phenotype of a temperature sensitive allele of KOR 1 /RSW 2 (rsw 2 - 1) even at the permissive temperature. This establishes that plant complex N-glycan modification is important for the in vivo function of KOR 1 /RSW 2. Furthermore, rsw 2 - 1 as well as another cellulose biosynthesis mutant rsw 1 - 1 exhibited also a salt-sensitive phenotype at the permissive temperature. Based on these findings, we propose that one of the mechanisms that cause salt-induced root growth arrest is dysfunction of cell wall biosynthesis that induces mitotic arrest in the root apical meristem...|$|E
40|$|N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are {{prevalent}} in desiccated seeds of various plant species, and their levels decline substantially during seed imbibition and germination. Here, seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. were germinated in, and seedlings maintained on, micromolar concentrations of N-lauroylethanolamine (NAE 12 : 0). NAE 12 : 0 inhibited root elongation, increased <b>radial</b> <b>swelling</b> of root tips, and reduced root hair numbers {{in a highly}} selective and concentration-dependent manner. These effects were reversible when seedlings were transferred to NAE-free medium. Older seedlings (14 days old) acclimated to exogenous NAE by increased formation of lateral roots, and generally, these lateral roots did not exhibit the severe symptoms observed in primary roots. Cells of NAE-treated primary roots were swollen and irregular in shape, {{and in many cases}} showed evidence, at the light- and electron-microscope levels, of improper cell wall formation. Microtubule arrangement was disrupted in severely distorted cells close to the root tip, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -localized green fluorescent protein (mGFP 5 -ER) was more abundant, aggregated and distributed differently in NAE-treated root cells, suggesting disruption of proper cell division, endomembrane organization and vesicle trafficking. These results suggest that NAE 12 : 0 likely influences normal cell expansion in roots by interfering with intracellular membrane trafficking to and/or from the cell surface. The rapid metabolism of NAEs during seed imbibition/germination may be a mechanism to remove this endogenous class of lipid mediators to allow for synchronized membrane reorganization associated with cell expansion...|$|E
40|$|The {{anisotropic}} {{growth of}} plant cells depends on cell walls having anisotropic mechanical properties, which are hypothesized to arise from aligned cellulose microfibrils. To test this hypothesis {{and to identify}} genes involved in controlling plant shape, we isolated mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana in which the degree of anisotropic expansion of the root is reduced. We report here the characterization of mutants at two new loci, RADIALLY SWOLLEN 4 (RSW 4) and RSW 7. The <b>radial</b> <b>swelling</b> phenotype is temperature sensitive, being moderate (rsw 7) or negligible (rsw 4) at the permissive temperature, 19 °C, and pronounced at the restrictive temperature, 30 °C. After transfer to 30 °C, the primary root’s elongation rate decreases and diameter increases, with all tissues swelling radially. Swelling is accompanied by ectopic cell production but swelling is not reduced when the extra cell production is eliminated chemically. A double mutant was generated, whose roots swell constitutively and more than either parent. Based on analytical determination of acid-insoluble glucose, the amount of cellulose was normal in rsw 4 and slightly elevated in rsw 7. The orientation of cortical microtubules was examined with immunofluorescence in whole mounts and in semi-thin plastic sections, and the orientation of microfibrils was examined with field-emission scanning electron microscopy and quantitative polarized-light microscopy. In the swollen regions of both mutants, cortical microtubules and cellulose microfibrils are neither depleted nor disoriented. Thus, oriented microtubules and microfibrils themselves are insufficient to limit radial expansion; {{to build a wall}} with high mechanical anisotropy, additional factors are required, supplied in part by RSW 4 and RSW 7...|$|E
