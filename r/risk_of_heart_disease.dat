Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study, revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the beverage is heated.|$|E
5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may lower the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%.

5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) {{are believed to be}} due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect <b>of</b> using {{different}} <b>risk</b> calculation tools on how general practitioners and practice nurses evaluate the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> with clinical data routinely available in patients' records. DESIGN: Subjective estimates <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and results <b>of</b> four different methods <b>of</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> {{were compared with}} each other and a reference standard that had been calculated with the Framingham equation; calculations were based on a sample of patients' records, randomly selected from groups at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> SETTING: General practices in central England. PARTICIPANTS: 18 general practitioners and 18 practice nurses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Agreement <b>of</b> results <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> estimation and risk calculation with reference calculation; agreement of general practitioners with practice nurses; sensitivity and specificity of the different methods <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> calculation to detect patients at high or low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> RESULTS: Only a minority of patients' records contained all <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> factors required for the formal calculation <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> (concentrations <b>of</b> high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were present in only 21 %). Agreement <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> calculations with the reference standard was moderate (kappa= 0. 33 - 0. 65 for practice nurses and 0. 33 to 0. 65 for general practitioners, depending on calculation tool), showing a trend for underestimation <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> Moderate agreement was seen between the risks calculated by general practitioners and practice nurses for the same patients (kappa= 0. 47 to 0. 58). The British charts gave the most sensitive results for <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> (practice nurses 79 %, general practitioners 80 %), and it also gave the most specific results for practice nurses (100 %), whereas the Sheffield table was the most specific method for general practitioners (89 %). CONCLUSIONS: Routine calculation <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in primary care is hampered by poor availability <b>of</b> data on <b>risk</b> factors. General practitioners and practice nurses are able to evaluate the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> with only moderate accuracy.

40|$|Aims The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether use of specific antibiotic drugs decreases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in diabetes mellitus type 2 patients. Methods and Results Data were obtained from the PHARMO Record Linkage System comprising pharmacy records and hospitalizations for all 450 000 residents of eight Dutch cities. In a nested case-control study among diabetes mellitus type patients, 244 cases with a first hospitalization for coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and 686 controls without coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> matched on age, sex, calendar time, and registration date in PHARMO RLS were selected. Use of antibiotic drugs among cases and controls was determined over 3 years prior to the event. Use of fluorquinolones for more than 14 days compared to no use of fluorquinolones was associated with a lower <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> (ORadj= 0. 30 (95 %CI: 0. 12 - 0. 75)). No association between tetracycline, macrolide and lincosamide treatment, or other antibiotic drugs (penicillins, cephalosporines, sulphonamides and trimethoprim), and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> was found.

40|$|Honey {{is rich in}} {{phenolic}} compounds, which act {{as natural}} antioxidants and are becoming increasingly popular because of their potential role in contributing to human health.

In a population-based prospective cohort study, participants were selected from 27 general practices in the north-eastern part of The Netherlands. In 1993, there were 3888 men and women, 57 years and older, who were without prevalent <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> During the 5 -year follow-up period, 287 cases <b>of</b> incident <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> (acute myocardial infarction and/or congestive heart failure) were registered (7 %).

On average, 4 percent of the socio-economic differences were accounted for by the classical coronary risk factors (e. g. smoking, hypertension) compared with 30 percent by the control beliefs. The contribution of the latter was largely independent of the former.
