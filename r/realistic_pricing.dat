40|$|Purpose – Marketers often combine {{products}} in bundles to increase demand. Research {{has shown that}} itemizing the prices of the individual {{products in}} the bundle raises evaluations in some situations. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate how bundle size influences the effect itemizing prices have on bundle evaluation. Design/methodology/approach – We conduct two experiments. In the first, we test the effects of price presentation formats (itemized vs consolidated) and bundle size on consumers’ evaluations of product bundles. In the second experiment, we test the proposed mechanism that itemizing the price leads to a more <b>realistic</b> <b>price</b> expectation which in turn enhances evaluation. We also test whether this effect is stronger for larger bundles. Findings – In Study 1,we find that large, but not small, bundles are evaluated more positive when presented with itemized prices. In Study 2 mediated moderation analysis supports the prediction that price expectation mediates the effect of the price presentation x bundle size interaction on bundle evaluations. The findings show that itemizing prices results in more <b>realistic</b> <b>price</b> expectations and that this effect is stronger for larger bundles. In turn, more <b>realistic</b> <b>price</b> expectations leads to higher evaluation. Research limitations/implications – The implication of this research is that by directing attention to individual items in the bundle, consumers are better able to assess bundle benefits. More research is needed to investigate other potential explanations for the findings in Study 1. Further research should also investigate whether the findings reported here holds in other settings, with other products, and with other types and size of bundles. Practical implications – Managers are recommended to itemize the prices of product bundles, particularly when bundles are large. Originality/value – This article extend our knowledge about the effect itemizing the prices of individual items in a bundle has on consumer evaluation by (1) demonstrating the moderating effect of bundle size, and (2) showing that more <b>realistic</b> <b>price</b> expectation explains these effects...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a novel {{approach}} to electricity price modeling, based on the powerful technique of stochastic time change. This technique allows us to incorporate the characteristic features of electricity prices (such as seasonal volatility, time varying mean reversion and seasonally occurring price spikes) into the model in an elegant and economically justifiable way. The stochastic time change introduces stochastic as well as deterministic (e. g., seasonal) features in the price process’ volatility and in the jump component. We specify the base process as a mean reverting jump diffusion and the time change as an absolutely continuous stochastic process with seasonal component. The activity rate of the stochastic time change {{can be related to}} the factors that influence supply and demand. Here we use the temperature as a proxy for the demand and hence, as the driving factor of the stochastic time change, and show that this choice leads to <b>realistic</b> <b>price</b> paths. We derive properties of the resulting price process and develop the model calibration procedure. We calibrate the model to the historical EEX power prices and apply it to generating <b>realistic</b> <b>price</b> paths by Monte Carlo simulations.

40|$|A {{strategic}} issue facing {{many developing}} economies is {{the maintenance of}} natural resources, which are important in ecological terms {{as well as providing}} income from tourism. This paper presents an analysis of the economic value of marine protected areas in the Seychelles. The contingent valuation method (CVM) is used to determine tourists willingness to pay (WTP) for visits to Seychelles marine national parks, but in addition, attitudinal and motivational data are related to respondents stated economic preferences. 300 interviews were conducted in the Seychelles during June 1998 and both tourists having visited a park and a more general population of tourists were surveyed. The results demonstrate that different economic values are predicted for respondents from different countries who display a range of both consumer and citizen behaviour in constructing their preferences. In addition, significantly different WTP amounts are predicted depending on which particular marine parks are visited. The discussion focuses on exploring how this information may be of use to policy makers in setting a <b>realistic</b> <b>pricing</b> policy for visitors to Marine National Parks in the Seychelles...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose new option pricing models based on class of models with jumps {{contained}} in the Lévy-type based models (NIG-Lévy, Schoutens, 2003, Merton-jump, Merton, 1976 and Duan based model, Duan et al., 2007). By combining these different classes of models with several volatility dynamics of the GARCH type, we aim at {{taking into account the}} dynamics of financial returns in a realistic way. The associated risk neutral dynamics of the time series models is obtained through two different specifications for the pricing kernel: we provide a characterization of the change in the probability measure using the Esscher transform and the Minimal Entropy Martingale Measure. We finally assess empirically the performance of this modelling approach, using a dataset of European options based on the S&P 500 and on the CAC 40 indices. Our results show that models involving jumps and a time varying volatility provide <b>realistic</b> <b>pricing</b> and hedging results for options with different kinds of time to maturities and moneyness.
