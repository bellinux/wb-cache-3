40|$|Abstract The Rashba spin-orbit {{splitting}} of a hydrogenic donor impurity in GaAs/GaAlAs quantum wells is investigated theoretically in {{the framework}} of effective-mass envelope function theory. The Rashba effect near the interface between GaAs and GaAlAs is assumed to be a linear relation with the distance from the quantum well side. We find that the splitting energy of the excited state is larger and less dependent on the position of the impurity than that of the ground state. Our results are useful for the application of Rashba spin-orbit coupling to photoelectric devices. In the framework of effective-mass envelope–function theory, excluding the <b>relativity</b> <b>effect,</b> the electronic states have been studied for a hydrogenic donor impurity in quantum wells (QWs) [1 – 5] and its important application in the photoelectric devices. The <b>relativity</b> <b>effect</b> introduces evidence of Rashba effects in the semiconductor materials. In recent years, spin-dependent phenomena was also proposed using spin field-effect transistor {{based on the fact that}} spin precession can be controlled by an external field due to the spin-orbit interaction [6]. Gvozdić et al. studied efficient switching of Rashba spin splitting in wide modulation-doped quantum wells [7].

40|$|While {{there is}} {{vigorous}} debate {{on whether the}} Anthropocene epoch began in 1800, as originally proposed, less {{attention has been paid}} to the transition from Stage 2 of the existing three stage chronology, in which carbon dioxide emissions accelerated after 1945, to Stage 3, in which after 2015 acceleration is expected to reach criticality, and the Earth System is predicted to pass through an irreversible “tipping point” to a warmer state, unless this is averted by a new planetary stewardship. This paper critically evaluates this chronology and finds (a) that there is insufficient evidence for an imminent irreversible tipping point, and (b) that the international community established a new planetary stewardship in 1992 when it agreed on new conventions on climate change and biodiversity in response to three decades of warnings about global environmental problems. The paper proposes an alternative framework for conceptualizing the transition between Stages 2 and 3 of the Anthropocene. This generates the hypothesis that after the actual carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere has exceeded a critical threshold level, some biophysical processes will change at rates proportional to the difference between the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere and the threshold level, and to the rate of climate change. Evidence is presented which suggests that this new reversible tipping point could have been passed before 1980, when enhanced forest growth was first observed in mature forests in Amazonia. Modelling simulations suggest that this temporal <b>relativity</b> <b>effect</b> could soon be joined by a spatio-temporal <b>relativity</b> <b>effect,</b> as species become committed to extinction and/or form new species assemblages in the 21 st Century when climate zones shift.

Due to the different materials used for {{the main body of the}} satellite and consequently predicted higher temperature of LARES satellite with respect to the other laser ranged satellites, it has been considered important to verify experimentally the behaviour of the Cube Corner Reflectors in simulated space environment. Specifically the goal of this experimental test is to check if the Cube Corner Reflectors will be subjected to temperature gradients that could induce deformations affecting the Far Field Diffraction Pattern and consequently could cause degradation of the laser reflected signal from the satellite Cube Corner Reflectors.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{expanding}} or contracting Kasner universes are unstable {{due to the}} amplification of gravitational waves (GW). As an application of this general <b>relativity</b> <b>effect,</b> we consider a pre-inflationary anisotropic geometry characterized by a Kasner-like expansion, which is driven dynamically towards inflation by a scalar field. We investigate the evolution of linear metric fluctuations around this background, and calculate the amplification of the long-wavelength GW of a certain polarization during the anisotropic expansion (this effect is absent for another GW polarization, and for scalar fluctuations). These GW are superimposed to the usual tensor modes of quantum origin from inflation, and are potentially observable if {{the total number of}} inflationary e-folds exceeds the minimum required to homogenize the observable universe only by a small margin. Their contribution to the temperature anisotropy angular power spectrum decreases with the multipole l as l^(-p), where p depends on the slope of the initial GW power-spectrum. Constraints on the long-wavelength GW can be translated into limits on the total duration of inflation and the initial GW amplitude. The instability of classical GW (and zero-vacuum fluctuations of gravitons) during Kasner-like expansion (or contraction) may have other interesting applications. In particular, if GW become non-linear, they can significantly alter the geometry before the onset of inflation...|$|E
30|$|Generally, an {{incident}} nano-micro-scaled e-beam generates {{an amount of}} local heat, Q, at {{the surface of the}} subject under irradiation, which can be described by Q[*]=[*]P·Δt·γ, where P·is the incident kinetic power, Δt is the time duration, and γ is the converting ratio. Ignoring the <b>relativity</b> <b>effect,</b> roughly P·Δt·γ[*]=[*]I·V·Δt·γ, where I is the beam current, and V is the accelerating voltage. Some heat is expected to dissipate though the substrate, TFTC leads, and radiation. The remaining part causes increment of the local surface temperature that is measurable by the TFTC sensors. That is, Q[*]=[*]Qsubstrate + Qlead + Qradiation + Qsensor, and Qsensor[*]=[*]C·ΔT[*]+[*]λ. Here, Qsubstrate, Qlead, and Qradiation represent thermally dissipated heat through the substrate, sensor leads, and radiation effect, respectively. Qsensor corresponds to the remained heat measured by the sensor, C is the thermal capacity of the sensor junction, ΔT is the increment of local temperature as compared to the cold ends of TFTCs, and λ is the latent heat of phase transition. Our previous studies have shown that, under the irradiation of the same e-beams, the measured output from TFTC sensors made on freestanding Si 3 N 4 window was 10 – 30 times larger than that taken from the same sensors on thick Si wafers [40]. This factor of enhancement indicated that Qsubstrate was much larger than Qsensor.|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} special {{relativity}} {{is used to}} analyze some of the physical phenomena associated with space-based coherent Doppler lidars aimed at Earth and the atmosphere. Two important cases of diffuse scattering and retroreflection by lidar targets are treated. For the case of diffuse scattering, we show that for a coaligned transmitter and receiver on the moving satellite, there is no angle between transmitted and returned radiation. However, the ray that enters the receiver does not correspond to a retroreflected ray by the target. For the retroreflection case there is misalignment between the transmitted ray and the received ray. In addition, the Doppler shift in the frequency {{and the amount of}} tip for the receiver aperture when needed are calculated, The error in estimating wind because of the Doppler shift in the frequency due to special <b>relativity</b> <b>effects</b> is examined. The results are then applied to a proposed space-based pulsed coherent Doppler lidar at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center for wind and aerosol backscatter measurements.

40|$|It {{is known}} [1] that the matrix of the {{hydrogen}} atom, determining the intensities {{of the hydrogen}} series lines and of their fine structure components, essentially depends on the integral [equation (1) ], where the functions χ and χ' are solutions of the Schroedinger equation [2] [equation (2) ]. The symbols µ, e stand for the mass and the charge of the electron; K = h/ 2 π (h Planck's constant). The energy E and the integer k have different values in χ and χ'. These functions {{are supposed to be}} finite for r = 0 and to vanish for r = ∞. Since in the case of elliptic orbits the functions X, X' turn out to be polynomials multiplied by an exponential, the direct evaluation term by term is possible on principle. The numerical computations involved are, however, so lengthy as to make this method almost prohibitive in practice. We give, therefore, in this note a reduction of the integral (1) to a simple and convenient expression. Such a reduction is quite indispensable in the case of hyperbolic orbits. Moreover, the procedure applied has an interest beyond the special case of the Kepler motions, since quite analogous expressions occur in other problems of the quantum theory. In fact, the same method has been used by the author for reducing the intensity expressions of the components in the Stark effect. 3 Only the simple closed Kepler motion, neglecting <b>relativity</b> <b>effect,</b> and spin of the electron, will be considered in the following sections...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that asteroids and comets fall into the Sun. Metal {{pollution}} of white dwarfs and transient spectroscopic signatures of young stars like β-Pic provide growing evidence that extra solar planetesimals can attain extreme orbital eccentricities and fall onto their parent stars. We aim to develop a general, practically implementable, semi-analytical theory of secular eccentricity excitation of small bodies in mean motion resonances with an eccentric planet valid for arbitrary values of the eccentricities and including the short-range force due to General Relativity. Our semi-analytic model for the restricted planar three-body problem does not make use of any series expansion and therefore is valid for any values of eccentricities and semi-major axes ratios. The model is based on the application of the adiabatic principle, which is valid when the precession period of the longitude of pericenter of the planetesimal is much longer than the libration period in the mean motion resonance. This holds down to vanishingly small eccentricities in resonances of order larger than 1. We provide a Mathematica notebook with the implementation of the model allowing direct use to the interested reader. We confirm that the 4 : 1 mean motion resonance with a moderately eccentric planet is the most powerful one to lift the eccentricity of planetesimals from nearly circular orbits to star-grazing ones. However, if the planet is too eccentric, we find that this resonances becomes unable to pump the planetesimal's eccentricity to very high value. The inclusion of the General <b>Relativity</b> <b>effect</b> imposes a condition on the mass of the planet to drive the planetsimals into star-grazing orbits. For a planetesimal at ∼ 1 AU around a solar-mass star (or white dwarf), we find a threshold planetary mass of about 17 Earth masses. We finally derive an analytical formula for this critical mass.
