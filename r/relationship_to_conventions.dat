40|$|Diagrammatic {{reasoning}} comprises {{phenomena that}} range from the so-called &quot;free-rides &quot; (e. g. almost immediate understanding of visually perceived <b>relationships)</b> <b>to</b> <b>conventions</b> about tokens. Such reasoning must involve cognitive processes that are highly perceptual in content. In the domain of mathematical proofs where diagrams have had a long history, {{we have an opportunity}} to investigate in detail and in a controlled setting the various perceptual devices and cognitive processes that facilitate diagrammatically based arguments. This paper continues recent work by examining two kinds of diagrammatic proofs, called Categories 1 and 3 by Jamnik, et. al. 97], the first being one in which generalization of a diagram instance is implied, and the second being one in which an infinite completion is represented by an ellipsis. We provide explanations of why these proofs work, a semantics for ellipses, and conjectures about the underlying cognitive processes that seem to resonate with such proofs. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{representation}} of the sleuth as a 'loner' {{is one of the}} most dominant and durable conventions of crime fiction. Despite this, there is surprisingly limited scholarship on the wider sociological ideas that could be considered as the foundation of the convention. This paper draws together ideas such as Georg Simmel's notion of 'the stranger', Robert Park and John Irwin’s studies of the city, Baudelaire's 'the flaneur', and the anthropological use of liminality and examines their possible <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the <b>convention</b> of the loner...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} ministerial career paths is {{neglected}} in the Canadian political science canon. The existing literature, data and methods {{are for the}} most part descriptive and require updating. This article addresses this deficit by focusing on the topic of ministerial appointments in the Canadian federal parliament. An event history model is developed to estimate the hazard of ministerial appointment for all government party members of Parliament for the period 1935 - 2008. Existing theories and explanations for ministerial appointments and their <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> constitutional <b>conventions</b> and political principles are systematically tested using a series of variables identified in the Canadian and comparative literature. The paper concludes with recommendations for further research and integration with complementary country-specific and comparative research programs in the field of ministerial career paths...|$|R
40|$|As the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) {{nears the}} final stages of {{implementation}} across Member States, it earns greater global recognition. An investigation into the ethos and status of the EU ETS raises interesting spaces to lead a sideline discussion on actual and likely objections by industries which emit greenhouse gases. It would appear that although the EU ETS is a model clean development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), there is reason to question its validity, at least following the recent inclusion of airlines in the EU ETS and with particular respect for its <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the Chicago <b>Convention...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{connection}} between the conventions of the live role-based performance of process drama and the mediated performance of online role-playing video games. Both activities allow participants to ‘become somebody else'. Both deal with the identity shifts possible within imagined environments. This mutability of identity provides a metaphor for considering the episodic nature of inrole performance and out-of-role reflection in both drama and video games. Using the massively multiplayer online role-playing (MMORP) game EverQuest as a case study, this paper examines digital performance and its <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the dramatic <b>conventions</b> of role distance and role protection. It also examines the common learning outcomes that could usefully be explored between process drama and video games...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} is conducted concerning the appropriate {{characterization of the}} Space Shuttle, taking into account appearance, functions, and purpose. It is concluded {{that in terms of}} purely technological criteria, the Shuttle can best be described as an 'aerospace vehicle'. Questions related to the legal characterization of the Shuttle are considered. On the basis of the Shuttle's purpose as the most important criterion, it is suggested that the Shuttle should be considered basically as a 'spacecraft', 'space vehicle', or 'space object'. Attention is given <b>to</b> the Shuttle's <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> multilateral space <b>conventions,</b> the possibility that the Shuttle could be legally defined as an 'aircraft' under certain circumstances, the Shuttle and the Chicago Convention, and the status of Spacelab as only one part of a U.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{representation}} of rape in two successful cable horror programs, FX’s American Horror Story (FX, 2011 -) and AMC’s The Walking Dead (AMC, 2010 -). I first offer a contextual analysis of the American television industry, focusing on the economic specificities of cable television and the brand identities of FX and AMC networks. I argue that {{the building of a}} quality brand within the contemporary television industry demands the valuation of controversial and edgy content, which includes sexual violence. Next, I engage in a textual analysis of American Horror Story: Coven and the fifth season of The Walking Dead. Drawing on narrative theory and film theory on horror, I look critically at the construction of the rape narratives, their visual representation, and their <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the <b>conventions</b> and expectations of the horror genre. Overall, this thesis considers how AHS and TWD relate to rape culture, both as products of a particular industrial context that values rape as controversial—yet desirable—content and as texts that depict rape. While both programs articulate feminist understandings of rape, they also include patriarchal and postfeminist discourses. Moreover, through different representational strategies, both programs represent rape as horror. TWD resists portraying literal rape and thus denies any pleasure in watching rape, whereas AHS incorporates rape into spectacles of violence. By aestheticizing and commodifying rape, AHS represents a tension between challenging rape culture and reaffirming it...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of the unreadable gesture and the <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the <b>conventions</b> of photographic representation forms {{the basis of this}} paper. Rather than home being a geographical location or a familial or cultural grouping, a more essential, foundational notion of belonging is created and maintained through repetition, convention and thus, familiarity. Through the establishment of routine behaviour, the practice of everyday life helps to create and maintain subjectivities through consensus, that comply with the dominant social order. It is proposed however, that periodically the sovereign-self shifts outside these conventions, which can be seen when gesture becomes unreadable; while this gesture can be photographed, the resulting image as a consequence holds a deliberate ambiguity {{that can be used to}} celebrate this unknowable part of human behaviour. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu’s important concept of ‘Habitus’ (1984), this paper will explore notions of the subjective state as home, of desires to locate our social and individual behaviour inside a set of practices which advocate conditions of belonging. There is a direct relationship of the photograph in regards to the temporal, iconic and the indexical, and the experience and readings of the everyday, as both share a fallibility (inadequacy) of proposing definite readings. The images utilise the visual strategies of editorial photography, specifically in terms of narrative, initially appearing in the tradition of the readable sequence and the resolved image. The photographs are scenarios in which the person and their purpose in the place of the image are at odds, this is disrupted further by the incongruous gesture/action, which through composition, framing and the selection of the moment all combine to render the image unreadable, and via the sequencing of multiple images subsequently celebrate the vital force of the unknowable/ unreadable in social/political evolution...|$|R

50|$|Fornieles {{was first}} {{recognized}} for his performance pieces such as Animal House (2011) at the experimental space, Guest Projects in London. Animal House helped refine {{a method that}} Fornieles would repeat in his subsequent works, engaging participants and viewers in sometimes awkward situations. Dorm Daze, grew out of Fornieles' interest in American fraternity culture as a large-scale on-line performance played-out on Facebook, where participants adopted profiles taken from real life American college students. Fornieles work focuses {{on the effect of}} narratives, habits and technology in the formation of social roles and personal identity. He uses performance to re-enact and distort <b>relationships</b> <b>to</b> archetypes and <b>conventions.</b> Each chapter of work is driven by an intense period of research centered on reinterpreting and remodeling the subject under investigation. The Dreamy Awards (2012), was a fictional ceremony initiated to raise questions about the cult of the awards bash. The work was presented at the Serpentine Galleries Park Nights with the participation of over 200 people including actor Zac Efron in a pre-recorded video clip. Other works include, New York New York Happy Happy (NY NY HP HP) (2013) where Fornieles was invited by Rhizome to organize a gala at the New Museum. The event was controversial because Fornieles scripted both actual Museum donors and actors blurring any sense of reality. Modern Family (2014) was a sullen installation where Fornieles explored the breakdown of the family both metaphorically and literally.|$|R
