40|$|ObjectiveThe {{use of the}} Semmes-Weinstein (SW) {{monofilament}} test {{is recommended}} as a screening method for diabetic neuropathy. It offers an important chance to prevent further complications of diabetic foot. We aimed to develop a prototype Robotic Monofilament Inspector {{that can be used}} as a standard machine for screening of diabetic neuropathy. MethodsDevelopment was divided into three parts: computer software, control box, and Robotic Monofilament Inspector. The examiner conducted the SW test (by hand and by robotic inspector), vibration perception threshold, and Toronto Clinical Scoring System without knowledge of patient information. The unpaired t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine the differences between independent groups in terms of continuous outcomes, while the χ 2 test was used to determine categorical outcomes. Agreement between the various diabetic neuropathy tests was measured using the kappa statistic. ResultsThe SW test and vibration perception threshold were more valid tests for neuropathy than the Toronto test. The <b>robotic</b> <b>test</b> was in excellent agreement with the two former tests and appeared to be valid (kappa statistic, 0. 35 - 0. 81). Another indirect evidence for the validity of the <b>robotic</b> <b>test</b> was the finding that diabetic patients with foot ulcers had a higher prevalence of neuropathy (77 % vs. 38 %). This might indicate that the <b>robotic</b> <b>test</b> was more valid than the manual test. ConclusionThe Robotic Monofilament Inspector could be used as a simple screening machine.

Exposure levels may be reduced by different drill and bit designs and drilling methods, but these interventions have not been systematically evaluated. The purpose of this project was to develop a <b>robotic</b> <b>test</b> bench system for measuring handle vibration on drills in order to compare differences in drill designs, power sources, bit designs and drilling methods. The test bench is a departure from the ISO method for measuring drill handle vibration (ISO 28927 - 10), which requires drilling by humans. The test bench system was designed to repeatedly drill into concrete blocks under force control while productivity and handle vibration were measured. Handle vibration levels with different drills and bit sizes were similar to those collected following ISO methods. A new <b>robotic</b> <b>test</b> bench system for measuring handle vibration is presented and validated against ISO methods and demonstrates dynamic properties similar to human drilling.

The influence of the posterior elements and of rim lesions was assessed by testing the joint immediately before and after removal of the posterior elements and after the creation of a 4 x 10 mm rim lesion in the disc. Stiffness of the spinal joint dropped significantly upon removal of the posterior elements, from 0. 81 to 0. 23 Nm/ ° for flexion and from 0. 65 to 0. 40 Nm/ ° for extension. Maximum moments dropped 37 % for flexion and 63 % for extension. The rim lesion caused a further significant stiffness reduction to 0. 21 and 0. 31 Nm/° respectively.

40|$|Abstract—Skid-steered mobile robots {{are widely}} used because of their simple {{mechanism}} and high reliability. Understanding the kinematics and dynamics of such a robotic platform is, how-ever, challenging due to the complex wheel/ground interactions and kinematic constraints. In this paper, we develop a kinematic modeling scheme to analyze the skid-steered mobile robot. Based on {{the analysis of the}} kinematics of the skid-steered mobile robot, we reveal the underlying geometric and kinematic relationships between the wheel slips and locations of the instantaneous rotation centers. As an application example, we also present how to utilize the modeling and analysis for robot positioning and wheel slip esti-mation using only low-cost strapdown inertial measurement units. The robot positioning and wheel slip-estimation scheme is based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) design that incorporates the kine-matic constraints for accuracy enhancement. The performance of the EKF-based positioning and wheel slip-estimation scheme are also presented.

The mechanism incorporates a unique design which mitigates {{many of the issues}} arising from load-cell compliance, common to most other serial and parallel mechanisms for material testing. This was achieved through a non-collocated design which raises additional challenges. Achieving high bandwidth control of the hexapod also presents challenges, and was achieved using a combination of LabVIEW real-time running on a floating-point Intel processor, along with LabVIEW FPGA running on 16 bit Xilinx FPGAs. In this paper the following unique aspects of this hexapod are discussed: the mitigation of load-cell compliance, non-collocated control, implementation of the controller on a real-time platform, and finally technical solutions to solve the complex forward-kinematics solution in real-time.

To focus on careful performance evaluation of the stabilization algorithm, we use a camera mounted on a <b>robotic</b> <b>test</b> platform that can have unknown perturbations in the horizontal plane, a commonly occurring scenario in mobile robotics. We show that the camera can be eectively stabilized using an inertial sensor and a single additional motor, without a joint position sensor. The algorithm uses an adaptive controller based on {{a model of the}} vertebrate Cerebellum for velocity stabilization, with additional drift correction. We have alsodeveloped a resolution adaptive retinal slip algorithm that is robust to motion blur. We evaluated the performance quantitatively using another high speed robot to generate repeatable sequences of large and fast movements that a gaze stabilization system can attempt to counteract. Thanks to the high-accuracy repeatability, we can make a fair comparison of algorithms for gaze stabilization. We show that the resulting system can reduce camera image motion to about one pixel per frame on average even when the platform is rotated at 200 degrees per second. As a practical application, we also demonstrate how the common task of face detection benets from active gaze stabilization. Learnable Camera Motion Model...|$|E
40|$|In robotic {{assisted}} {{beating heart}} surgery, the control architecture for heart motion tracking has stringent requirements {{in terms of}} bandwidth of the motion {{that needs to be}} tracked. In order to achieve sufficient tracking accuracy, feed-forward control algorithms, which rely on estimations of upcoming heart motion, have been proposed in the literature. However, performance of these feed-forward motion control algorithms under heart rhythm variations is an important concern. In their past work, the authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of a receding horizon model predictive control-based algorithm, which used generalized adaptive predictors, under constant and slowly varying heart rate conditions. This paper extends these studies to the case when the heart motion statistics change abruptly and significantly, such as during arrhythmias. A feasibility study is carried out to assess the motion tracking capabilities of the adaptive algorithms in the occurrence of arrhythmia during beating heart surgery. Specifically, the tracking performance of the algorithms is evaluated on prerecorded motion data, which is collected in vivo and includes heart rhythm irregularities.

In the framework of an end-to-end simulation of the final approach to and capture of a tumbling client satellite, the necessary components are developed and the entire chain will be tested and verified. Concerning the on-board system, this involves the robotic arm for grasping the client, a stereo camera for visual servoing mounted on the robotic arm, the rendezvous sensors (CCD camera and LiDAR), and the on-board navigation and control software.

Despite the increase in available robotic platforms and associated enabling technologies such as localisation and communication, there exists a requirement for an a ordable generic testbed that will facilitate entry into the distributed mobile robotic research space. This thesis addresses this shortcoming by presenting the design and validation of a distributed mobile <b>robotic</b> <b>testbed</b> which facilitates research and development. The development and realisation of the closed-loop mobile <b>robotic</b> <b>testbed,</b> complete with oor area, localisation and communications support, is presented. Validation of the testbed is a two-fold process. First performance capability tests in relation to trajectory following, path planning, localisation and real time distributed communication overhead costs illustrate the superiority of a specialised solution such as the MiaBot Pro robotic platform over a generic low-cost solution such as the LEGO Mindstorm NXT robotic alternative. Secondly, the testbed is used to address the current lack of a low-cost empirical solution for researchers in the eld of string stability. Research in this area is still largely based on simulation results due to the prohibitive implementation costs of a real-world test system for string stability.

40|$|Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) are {{biological}} electrical generators or batteries {{that have}} {{shown to be}} able to energise electronic devices solely from the breakdown of organic matter found in wastewater. The generated power from a single unit is currently insufficient to run standard electronics hence alternative strategies are needed for stepping-up their performance to functional levels. This line of work deals with MFC miniaturisation; their proliferation into large stacks; power improvement by using new electrode components and finally a novel method of energy harvesting that will enhance the operation of a self-sustainable robotic platform. A new-design small-MFC design was developed using 3 D printing technology that outperformed a pre-existing MFC of the same volume (6. 25 mL) highlighting the importance of reactor configuration and material selection. Furthermore, improvements were made by the use of a cathode electrode that facilitates a higher rate of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the high surface area carbon nanoparticles coated on the outer layer. Consequently, a 24 -MFC stack was built to simulate a small-scale wastewater treatment system. The MFC units were connected in various arrangements, both fluidically as a series of cascades and electrically in-parallel or in-series, for identifying the best possible configuration for organic content reduction and power output. Results suggest that in-parallel connections allow for higher waste removal and the addition of extra units in a cascade is a possible way to ensure that the organic content of the feedstock is always reduced to below the set or permitted levels for environmental discharge. Finally, a new method of fault-proof energy harvesting in stacks was devised and developed to produce a unique energy autonomous energy harvester without any voltage boosting and efficiencies above 90 %.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) forces in-vivo is instrumental for understanding ACL injury mechanisms and {{for improvement of}} surgical ACL reconstruction. The goal of this thesis was {{to develop and implement}} a non-invasive method to determine the ACL forces under physiological loading using advanced imaging techniques combined with a <b>robotic</b> <b>testing</b> system. First, the in-vivo elongation of the ACL in response to increasing weightbearing was captured by a Dual Fluoroscopic Imaging System (DFIS). Next, the force-elongation curves of the ACL were determined in-situ by the <b>robotic</b> <b>testing</b> system. The in-vivo ACL elongation data were statistically mapped to force-elongation curves and the in-vivo ACL forces were estimated. A gold standard <b>robotic</b> <b>testing</b> protocol was implemented to validate the proposed force estimation method in cadaveric specimens. Moreover, this methodology was extended to the bundles of the ACL - i. e., anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles - to determine the force contribution of each bundle. The data showed that the ACL force is greater at lower flexion angles. Generally, the AM bundle carried greater portion of the tension within the ACL at all flexion angles. The data revealed that the load sharing patterns of the two bundles were complementary. The proposed force estimation method was then generalized to measure the contact pressure distribution of the tibiofemoral cartilage. By knowing the tibiofemoral cartilage deformation data in-vivo, and mapping them to in-vitro material property data, one can determine the in-vivo contact pressure inside the tibiofemoral joint. As the first step of application, the DFIS was employed to investigate the time-dependent responses of the tibiofemoral cartilage under a constant bodyweight load (in-vivo creep). The cartilage contact deformation in the lateral compartment was shown to be greater than that in the medial compartment of the knee. The findings of this work provide insight into the biomechanical role of the ACL during in-vivo activities and can be used as quantitative guidelines for the development of optimized surgical reconstruction techniques. The methodology could have a wide application in determination of in-vivo loading of human musculoskeletal joints. by Ali Hosseini. Thesis (Ph. D.)
