The level of automation of industrial manufacturing systems was measured and interfaced with quality-related cost.

The results indicate that quality <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> increase with increase in the level of automation of industrial machines. However at very high automation levels, quality <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> become significantly lower. Models depicting the relationship between quality-related cost and automation were developed and tested.

5000|$|The above {{example of}} a 2oo3 fault {{tolerant}} system increases both mission reliability as well as safety. However, the [...] "basic" [...] reliability of the system will in this case still be lower than a non redundant (1oo1) or 2oo2 system. Basic reliability engineering covers all failures, including those that might not result in system failure, but do result in additional cost due to: maintenance repair actions; logistics; spare parts etc. For example, replacement or repair of 1 faulty channel in a 2oo3 voting system, (the system is still operating, although with one failed channel it has actually become a 2oo2 system) is contributing to basic unreliability but not mission unreliability. As an example, {{the failure of the}} tail-light of an aircraft will not prevent the plane from flying (and so is not considered a mission failure), but it does need to be remedied (with a <b>related</b> <b>cost,</b> and so does contribute to the basic unreliability levels).|$|E

Apart from costs of medication, other disease <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> such as treatment and follow-up of co-morbidities, doctor visits, blood tests and glucose measurements have not been analyzed in the present paper and may be the further investigated in other studies.

40|$|Generating {{companies}} use {{the maintenance}} cost {{function as the}} sole or main objective for creating the maintenance schedule of power generators. Usually only maintenance activities <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> are considered to derive the cost function.

This paper models various cost components that affect the maintenance activities in deregulated power markets. The costs that we model include direct and indirect maintenance, failures, interruptions, contractual compensation, rescheduling, and market opportunity. The loss of firm’s reputation and selection of loyalty model are also considered using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) within an opportunity cost model. A case study is used to illustrate the modelling activities. The enhanced model is utilised in generator maintenance scheduling cases. The experimental results demonstrate the importance and impact of market <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> in maintenance schedules...|$|R

40|$|A Split System Approach (SSA) based {{methodology}} {{is presented}} to assist in making optimal Preventive Maintenance decisions for serial production lines. The methodology treats a production line as a complex series system with multiple PM actions over multiple intervals. Both risk <b>related</b> <b>cost</b> and maintenance <b>related</b> <b>cost</b> are factored into the methodology as either deterministic or random variables. This SSA based methodology enables Asset Management (AM) decisions to be optimized considering {{a variety of factors}} including failure probability, failure cost, maintenance cost, PM performance, and the type of PM strategy. The application of this new methodology and an evaluation of the effects of these factors on PM decisions are demonstrated using an example. The results of this work show that the performance of a PM strategy can be measured by its Total Expected Cost Index (TECI). The optimal PM interval is dependent on TECI, PM performance and types of PM strategies. These factors are interrelated. Generally it was found that a trade-off between reliability and the number of PM actions needs to be made so that one can minimize Total Expected Cost (TEC) for asset maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Water {{emission}} trading (WET) {{is promising}} in sustainable development strategy. However, low participation impedes its development. We develop an evolutionary game model of two enterprise populations’ dynamics {{and stability in}} the decision-making behavior process. Due to the different perceived value of certain permits, enterprises choose H strategy (bidding for permit) or D strategy (not bidding). External factors are simplified according to three categories: rH-bidding <b>related</b> <b>cost,</b> G-price and F-penalty. Participation increase equals reaching point (H,H) in the model and is treated as an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). We build a system dynamics model on AnyLogic 7. 1. 1 to simulate the aforementioned game and draw four conclusions: (1) to reach ESS more quickly, we need to minimize the bidding <b>related</b> <b>cost</b> rH and price G, but regulate the heavy penalty F; (2) an ESS can be significantly transformed, such as from (D,D) to (H,H) by regulating rH, G and F accordingly; (3) the initial choice of strategy is essential to the final result; (4) if participation seems stable but unsatisfying, it is important to check whether it is a saddle point and adjust external factors accordingly. The findings benefit both water management practice and further research...|$|E
