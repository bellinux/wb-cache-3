25|$|A typeII error (or {{error of}} the second kind) is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis.

25|$|Kurzweil says {{evolutionary}} progress looks smooth, {{but that}} <b>really</b> <b>it</b> {{is divided into}} paradigms, specific methods of solving problems. Each paradigm starts with slow growth, builds to rapid growth, and then levels off. As one paradigm levels off, pressure builds to find or develop a new paradigm. So {{what looks like a}} single smooth curve is really series of smaller S curves. For example Kurzweil notes that when vacuum tubes stopped getting faster, cheaper transistors became popular and continued the overall exponential growth.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{of these}} Clair Brothers-supported dates {{did not have}} a dedicated monitor engineer—monitors were mixed from FOH by Porter, assisted by Jackson. Jackson noticed that Presley's performance was very much dependent on how easily he was able to hear himself from the monitor speakers. Jackson said, [...] "some nights would work well and others would be a total train wreck." [...] He advocated for a separate monitor mixing position {{at the side of the}} stage and after overcoming resistance to the concept was given this dedicated position.

In 1999, when Betty was celebrating 30 years on-screen, Alison Boshoff of the Daily Mail praised the character's never changing style: [...] "for 30 years, one favourite fixture of Coronation Street has remained exactly the same [...] barmaid Betty Turpin. With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back. <b>Really,</b> <b>it</b> has been a wonderful experience and I feel very glad I was able to stick around for so long." ...|$|E

[...] Steven Tyler described Sanchez's performance as [...] "great" [...] while Randy Jackson noted that it was [...] "unbelievable, sensational". James Montgomery of MTV News graded her performance with a B, and called the cover [...] "a bit of an odd choice, and yet also a supremely confident one". He added, [...] "For once, she pulled things back, and maybe suffered a bit for doing so, but there were still plenty of subtly great moments, particularly in the verses.

In this album, I was screaming in a room — just like I was screaming in the song — I was screaming in a room with all my girlfriends, yelling all the shit we really say." [...] Rebecca Thomas of MTV News wrote: [...] "A platinum-blond Keri gyrates, thrusts, licks and gets (way) low as she laces the song with enough saucy language and expletives to make your favorite rapper blush." [...] while Jocelyn Vena the same news division of MTV commented that even though there are several cameo appearances in the mini-move, it is ultimately Hilson's [...] "scantily clad popping and locking that has everyone buzzing." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine called the video [...] "overproduced and under-clothed." ...|$|E
500|$|Tarwater {{was raised}} in a Christian home, but growing up he [...] "sort of went through the motions" [...] and didn't really hold strong beliefs. By college, he had {{abandoned}} any pretense of faith. [...] He later said that [...] "the Olympics had become an idol in my life." [...] After not making the Olympics in 2008, he met Doug Banister who challenged Tarwater to re-examine his worldview. [...] "The 'A-ha' moments were many," [...] Tarwater later recalled. [...] "y the time I had the ability to prayerfully repent and rebuke the stuff in my life, I was finally at a good time in life.... I would say I recommitted my life because I grew up in a Christian home, but <b>really</b> <b>it</b> was the first time where I knew what I was doing and committed my life to Christ." [...] Tarwater credits his Christian faith for helping him get through {{the ups and downs of}} being a competitive swimmer.

500|$|On March 15, 2012, Rihanna {{explained}} her {{collaboration with}} Brown to Ryan Seacrest during his morning show: [...] "The first song that came about was 'Birthday Cake'. I mean, {{we ended up}} recording {{them at the same}} time and executing them together. But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, <b>really,</b> <b>it</b> made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist out right now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent." [...] In March 2012, American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] remix. The following month, Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself, along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses.

500|$|The {{songs for}} Spiritual Machines were written and {{partially}} recorded during {{a year in}} which the band was doing extensive touring of Canada, the United States, and Europe. According to lead singer Maida, the live stage-context inspired the band to [...] "keep it really basic and not try to add too many textures... to not overdo it." [...] and giving the technically inclined record an ironically acoustic feel at times. According to Maida, half of the record was completed before the book and its ideas even entered the equation. During an interview in late 2001, he stated, [...] "... even though it seems quite intrinsic to the record, <b>really,</b> <b>it</b> only represents about four or five songs." [...] While the lyrics of several songs were inspired by the futuristic theories of Kurzweil, they were also written as a response to them, saying that the human spirit would always prevail. [...] "Lyrically, this album is about finding the spirituality within ourselves." [...] This is the case with the opening song, [...] "Right Behind You (Mafia)", which Raine said, [...] ".. not an 'f-you' to Kurzweil. It's like 'I believe [...] what you're saying, but we're going to fight it as well because there is a soul and there is a spirit.'" [...] Following [...] "Mafia" [...] is the song [...] "In Repair", which muses on how the human body can be [...] "repaired," [...] whether through heart surgery or after an accident. This song is countered by the following track, [...] "Life" [...] which, explained Maida, [...] "recognizes the pain our minds can experience." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1958 he {{was second}} {{in the league in}} both wins (17) and ERA (2.68); his seventh two-hitter, a 1–0 win on June 21 against the Baltimore Orioles in which the White Sox scored only an unearned run in the first inning, was {{followed}} by the greatest game of his career. On June 27 against the Senators, he retired the first 26 batters before pinch hitter Ed Fitz Gerald lined Pierce's first pitch down the first base line for an opposite-field double that landed about a foot from the foul line. Pierce then struck out Albie Pearson on three pitches to end the game; only twice did he go to a three-ball count. The lone hit marred what would have been a remarkable accomplishment; not only had no left-hander pitched a perfect game since Lee Richmond in 1880, but only one AL left-hander (Mel Parnell in 1956) pitched even a no-hitter between 1931 and 1962. Although disappointed by the near miss, Pierce praised his teammates for their defensive work, saying, [...] "Give Luis plenty of credit. And Sherm really mixed 'em up beautifully. The big thing is that we won." [...] At a Capitol lunch with several White Sox players during the following year's pennant race, Vice President Richard Nixon told Pierce that he had watched the game on television, saying, [...] "I'm a Washington fan, but that was one night I was rooting for the White Sox." [...] In a 1982 interview, Pierce said, [...] "The book on Fitz Gerald was that he was a fastball hitter on the first ball and liked it inside where he could pull it. So we threw him a curve away and he hit into right for a solid hit. I didn't feel that badly about it, <b>really.</b> <b>It</b> didn't mean that much at the moment. But now ... well, now I wish I had got it. It would have been nice." [...] His streak of 33 consecutive scoreless innings was ended with an unearned run in the seventh inning on July 1.|$|E
