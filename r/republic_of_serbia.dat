5|$|From 1945, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was governed as {{a federal}} socialist state {{comprising}} six newly created republics– Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia. The current border between Serbia and Croatia was defined in 1945 by a Yugoslav federal government commission which assigned areas with a majority Serb population to the Socialist <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia</b> and those with a Croatian majority to the Socialist Republic of Croatia. This left a large Serb minority in Croatian territory.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the age and}} {{location}} of the Golubac Fortress, it is both large and well-preserved. Its placement {{at the head of}} the Iron Gate gorge allowed for easy control of river traffic. It was the last military outpost on that stretch of the Danube river, which caused it to frequently be part of the final line of defense between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, especially during the periods when Serbia was Ottoman-held. The importance of the fortress is further indicated by the attention it received from Sigismund and Murad II, rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities. The Golubac Fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first general {{outline of}} the post-1945 borders of Croatia {{was made by the}} Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia on 24 February 1945. Some issues {{regarding}} the border, such as Baranja, were left unresolved. The newly established Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, a part of the Socialist <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia</b> since April 1945, sought to establish its border with the Socialist Republic of Croatia along the Drava River, thus including Baranja, the Danube and along the Vukovar–Županja line. To counter the claims made by Vojvodina, Croatian authorities staked counterclaims in the areas of Vukovar, Vinkovci, Baranja and in the area of Sombor.|$|E
50|$|Note: The United States {{announced}} on May 21, 1992, {{that it would}} not recognize the Federal <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia, comprising the <b>Republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro, as the successor to the Socialist Federal <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia.|$|R
50|$|The 1992-93 First League of FR Yugoslavia was {{the first}} {{football}} season in the Federal <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia which was composed <b>of</b> the <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro, following {{the breakup of the}} Socialist Federal <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia. FK Partizan were the champions.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Laušević's visible {{opposition}} to the civil wars in Yugoslavia made him a target of ongoing media attacks in the <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro. He was often harassed {{when he went to}} public places.|$|R
5|$|The {{prevalent}} {{opinion is}} that the church was constructed and painted in the early 14th century, which coincides with the lifetimes of the individuals most widely accepted as represented by the figures depicted in the church's frescoes. At the time, the village of Donja Kamenica, along {{with much of the}} Timočka Krajina region, belonged to the Vidin appanage of the Second Bulgarian Empire. However, alternative theories place the construction of the church in the mid-14th century, the mid-15th century or even the 16th century. The church and its frescoes were restored in 1958. The church was declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance in 1982, and it is protected by the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia.</b>|$|E
5|$|YUG, SCG. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia (officially the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929) participated as Yugoslavia (YUG) {{in three}} Games before the Second World War. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also participated using the Yugoslavia designation, {{for all but}} one Games between 1948–1992, and hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later State Union of Serbia and Montenegro), {{consisting}} of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia</b> and the Republic of Montenegro, participated at the Games of 1998 and the Games of 2002 as Yugoslavia (YUG) and at the Games of 2006 as Serbia and Montenegro (SCG). Now ex-republics and ex-province of the Yugoslavia represented by seven successor NOCs, of which all but one {{have participated in the}} Winter Games.|$|E
5|$|Following the Ottoman {{withdrawal}} from Niš in 1878, the tower was roofed over, and in 1892 a chapel was built around it. In 1937, the chapel was renovated. A bust of Sinđelić was added the following year. In 1948, Skull Tower and the chapel enclosing it were declared Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance and {{came under the}} protection of the Socialist <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia.</b> Further renovation of the chapel occurred again in 1989. As of 2013, 54 skulls remain on the tower. The one that is said to belong to Sinđelić is enclosed in a glass container. Seen as a symbol of independence by Serbs, the tower is mentioned in the writings of French Romantic poet Alphonse de Lamartine and English travel writer Alexander William Kinglake. In the two centuries since its construction, it has become a popular tourist attraction, visited by between 30,000 and 50,000 people annually.|$|E
5000|$|On 28 April 1992, the new Federal <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia was established, by the {{remaining}} <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro <b>of</b> the former Socialist Federal <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia. On 22 September 1992, United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/47/1 was adopted, {{by which it}} considered that [...] "the Federal <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia (<b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically {{the membership of the}} former Socialist Federal <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia in the United Nations," [...] and therefore decided that [...] "the Federal <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia (<b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate {{in the work of the}} General Assembly". It did not apply for membership until Slobodan Milošević was ousted from the presidency and was admitted on 1 November 2000 (see the section Former members: Yugoslavia).|$|R
50|$|The {{municipality}} borders Žabǉak Municipality, Bijelo Poǉe Municipality and Mojkovac Municipality in Montenegro, {{as well as}} the <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia</b> and Bosnia and Herzegovina. With a {{total area}} of 1346 km2, it is the third largest municipality in Montenegro.|$|R
50|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Socialist Federal <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia during the 1990s, only the <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro agreed to maintain the Yugoslav state, and established a new constitution for a new Yugoslavia in 1992. With {{the collapse}} of communism across Eastern Europe, the new state followed the wave of democratic change. It abandoned former communist symbolism: the red star was removed from the national flag, and the communist coat of arms was replaced by a white double-headed eagle with the arms <b>of</b> both <b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro within it. The new state also abandoned the collective presidency of the former SFRY and replaced it with the system consisting of a single president, who was initially appointed with the consent <b>of</b> the <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia</b> and Montenegro until 1997 after which the president was democratically elected.|$|R
5|$|The Yugoslav {{government}} of the newly formed FR Yugoslavia (successor to SFR Yugoslavia) ended up having three ideologically-opposed leaders occupying executive positions. From 1992, while Slobodan Milošević {{was the president of}} the Federal <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia,</b> national theorist Dobrica Ćosić was named President of FR Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, Milan Panić, a business magnate based in Newport Beach, California, accepted Milošević's invitation to be Prime Minister. Panić was subsequently elected as Prime Minister in the 1992 Yugoslav parliamentary elections. The United States did not revoke Panić's citizenship even though his occupation of an executive position in the Yugoslav government clearly contradicted the United States Constitution. Nevertheless, Panić would become a person of interest in US diplomatic circles, given his business and residence backgrounds. At a CSCE meeting in Helsinki in July 1992, US Secretary of State James Baker abruptly dismissed Panić's appeal to reduce the sanctions to Yugoslavia, even after an agreement (between Panić, Milošević, and Dušan Mitević) was reached by which Milošević would resign in return for sanction-relief. This ended up severely damaging Panić's unique diplomatic position internationally, as well as his standing in Yugoslavia. The Los Angeles Times published an article which described Panić as a doubtful upholder of potential American-Yugoslavian peacemaking, when in fact, many years later made to be known, Panić was actually invited by Baker in the first place rather than voluntarily coming to Helsinki.|$|E
5|$|YUG, IOP, SCG. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia (officially the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929) participated as Yugoslavia (YUG) in five Games {{before the}} Second World War. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also participated using the Yugoslavia (YUG) designation, for all Games between 1948–1988. Because of United Nations {{sanctions}} in Security Council Resolution 757, athletes from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) competed as Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) at the 1992 Games. They were {{not permitted to}} compete in team sports such as basketball, handball, or water polo, and the Olympic flag was used in medal ceremonies. Athletes from the Republic of Macedonia competed as Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) at the 1992 Games because their NOC had not been formed. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later State Union of Serbia and Montenegro), consisting of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serbia</b> and the Republic of Montenegro, participated at the Games of 1996 and 2000 as Yugoslavia (YUG), and at the Games of 2004 as Serbia and Montenegro (SCG). In 2008 and 2012, the former republics of Yugoslavia were represented by six successor NOCs. In 2016, the autonomous province of Kosovo became the seventh successor NOC.|$|E
