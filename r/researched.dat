Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being <b>researched</b> as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being <b>researched</b> as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being <b>researched,</b> as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease.
