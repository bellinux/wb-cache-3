40|$|Abstract. Amorphous InAsSb {{films and}} {{hydrogenated}} InAsSb films are deposited on substrates of quartz glass and silicon by rf magnetron sputtering technique in different gas ambient. The effect of H addition on structure, optical properties and electrical properties of a-InAsSb is studied. It is {{found that the}} bonded hydrogen content increases with increasing H 2 to Ar flow rate radio(R). When R is 0. 1, Hydrogen addition shifts the optical absorption edge to higher energy, decreases the dark conductivity and improves the photo-sensitivity. However, hydrogen addition produces the crystallization of the film at R> 0. 1. Moreover the optical gap, dark conductivity and photo-sensitivity of the films have a <b>reverse</b> <b>change</b> compared with that in R= 0. These results demonstrate that hydrogen has obvious passivation effects on rf sputtered amorphous InAsSb thin films only at R= 0. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} for magnetic `propeller'-driven outflows which cause a rapidly rotating magnetized star accreting from a disk to spin-down. Energy and angular momentum lost by the star goes into expelling {{most of the}} accreting disk matter. The theory gives an expression for the effective Alfven radius $R_A$ (where the inflowing matter is effectively stopped) which depends on the mass accretion rate, the star's mass and magnetic moment, and the star's rotation rate. The model points to a mechanism for `jumps' between spin-down and spin-up evolution and for the reverse transition, which are changes between two possible equilibrium configurations of the system. In for example the transistion from spin-down to spin-up states the Alfven radius $R_A$ decreases from a value larger than the corotation radius to one which is smaller. In this transistion the `propeller' goes from being ``on'' to being ``off. '' The ratio of the spin-down to spin-up torque (or the ratio for the <b>reverse</b> <b>change)</b> in a jump is shown to be of order unity.

40|$|Cells {{transformed}} by Rous sarcoma virus take up 2 -deoxyglucose {{at a faster}} rate than uninfected cells, under conditions where transformed and nontransformed cells grow at the same rate. In cells infected by a temperature-sensitive mutant, the stimulation of 2 -deoxyglucose uptake is temperature dependent: the increase is observed at the permissive (36 °C), but not at the nonpermissive (41. 5 °) temperature. When infected cells are shifted from the nonpermissive temperature to the premissive temperature, the uptake of 2 -deoxyglucose increases from a rate equal to that of uninfected cells to a rate equal to that of cells infected by the wild-type Schmidt-Ruppin Rous sarcoma virus. The <b>reverse</b> <b>change</b> occurs when the infected cells are shifted from the permissive to the nonpermissive temperature. By the use of cytosine arabinoside, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, it was possible to show that DNA synthesis is neither required for the transformation, which occurs when the infected cells are shifted from the nonpermissive to the permissive temperature, nor for the phenotypic reversion, which occurs in the reverse shift...|$|E
