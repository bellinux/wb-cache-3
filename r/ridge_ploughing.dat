25|$|This is {{a variety}} of <b>ridge</b> <b>plough</b> notable in that the blade points towards the operator. It is used solely by human effort rather than with animal or machine assistance, and is pulled {{backwards}} by the operator, requiring great physical effort. It is particularly used for second breaking of ground, and for potato planting. It is found in Shetland, some western crofts and more rarely Central Scotland. The tool is typically found on small holdings too small or poor to merit use of animals.|$|R

Tillage methods compared during 2006 and 2007 for the early and late seasons on Oxic Tropuldalf at Owo in rainforest zone of Nigeria were manual clearing, manual mounding, ploughing, ploughing plus harrowing and ploughing plus harrowing plus <b>ridging.</b> <b>Ploughing</b> plus harrowing plus ridging produced the highest mean fruit weight (8. 16 t/ha), plant height, tap root length followed by manual mounding (7. 05 t/ha), ploughing plus harrowing (6. 24 t/ha) and ploughing (5. 81 t/ha). The lowest yield (5. 03 t/ha) was produced by manual clearing. The tillage treatments had lower bulk densities and higher leaf N, P, K, Ca and Mg compared with manual clearing. Soil bulk density was negatively correlated with leaf nutrient concentration in both years. Ploughing plus harrowing plus ridging improved nutrient availability and yield of tomato on an Alfisol because of reduced soil bulk density.

Although {{the surface and}} (more recently) {{subsurface}} morphology of scours are well-documented, little is known {{of the effect of}} grain size on the detectability, style and intensity of sub-scour deformation. This investigation macroscopically and microscopically (two-dimensional thin sections) examines suspected ice keel scour in: (i) glaciolacustrine pebbly sandy mud and (ii) fine-grained sands at Scarborough Bluffs, Ontario, Canada. In this investigation, there is an almost identical suite of deformation structures (individual structures and overprinted structural patterns) to those identified in icebergscoured clays from former Glacial Lake Agassiz (Manitoba, Canada); this confirms that deformation in the pebbly sandy mud and fine-grained sands at Scarborough Bluffs is likely to be indicative of ice keel scour. Discrete differences in the detectability, style and intensity of deformation between the Scarborough Bluffs and Glacial Lake Agassiz sediments are probably a function of grain size in response to ice keel scour. This research provides additional information on the types of structures that are associated with sediment deformation by processes of ice keel scour in a variety of grain sizes. This information is particularly valuable to inform palaeoenvironmental reconstruction and offshore engineering in areas where ice keel scour occurs in a variety of grain sizes. It also demonstrates the potential value of micromorphology where, for example, the study of cores is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Archaeological remains {{are very}} often buried under uneven soil of {{agricultural}} fields crossed by rather parallel furrows and <b>ridges.</b> Consequently, <b>ploughing</b> in a magnetic survey might produce a repetitive, quite regular, linear {{noise in the}} data, which could impede optimal recovery of the archaeological magnetic anomalies; depending on the acquisition line orientation, this noise may show as an oblique, vertical or horizontal pattern in the magnetic maps. Several studies have tested and verified methods for oblique ploughing minimization, but, to our knowledge, no procedures regarding the vertical and horizontal types of noise have been published. The present research proposes a procedure to filter each type of ploughing effect through an algorithm working in the wavenumber domain. The procedure produces images with a considerable reduction of the noise in any direction, resulting in enhanced visibility and readability of the archaeological anomalies...|$|R

Major emphasis {{is given to the}} implementation of conservation tillage by using animal drawn rippers, as an alternative to conventional mouldboard ploughing. This simple technology has already proven (by on-station research and on-farm adaptive trials) to be quite successful in being able to establish a good crop stand while requiring little energy. It may provide the best opportunity to reduce the negative effects of drought, and thus improve food security and protect the agricultural base from further degradation. Crops are maize, cotton, sunflower and soybean. Results of this work will be presented with regard to operational (time and energy consumption) and agronomical aspects (soil structure, water availability, crop establishment, yields and weeds). Various tillage systems are being assessed and compared: shallow ripping by oxen, deep (15 - 25 cm) ripping by oxen, ploughing using a common ox-drawn mouldboard <b>plough,</b> <b>ridging</b> after deep ripping (all by oxen), manual hoe or stick planting, manual preparation of basins. Energy input was by far the lowest in shallow ripping, followed by deep ripping. These operations can be carried out rapidly and timely (even before the onset of the rains). The most intensive tillage treatments (mouldboard <b>ploughing,</b> <b>ridging)</b> showed higher yields and caused the lowest weed pressure.

40|$|In 1944 and 1945 {{large areas}} of the Netherlands were {{inundated}} with sea-water. After removing the flood-water the salt and moisture figures of the soil were checked, usually to a depth of 80 cm, for several winters and summers. The drying and salinization (in particular of the <b>plough</b> <b>ridge)</b> of the soil in summer and the rewetting and leaching in winter were studied. The distribution of salt through the soil was governed mainly by downward passage of precipitation and upward capillary transport of soil moisture during summerweather. Irregular distribution in short distances was primarily due to unequal rates of intake. To calculate the downward passage of water through the soil, the loss of salt from a column of soil was divided by salt concentration of the solution leaving the bottom of the column. This concentration was assumed equal to the mean concentration of the lowest part of the column during leaching. Conditions limiting this method were discussed.

40|$|Raindrop impact {{can be a}} major {{contributor}} to particle mobilization for soils and other granular materials. In previous work, water repellent soils, comprised of hydrophobic particles, have been shown to exhibit greater splash erosion losses under multiple drop impact. However, the underlying principle differences in splash behavior between hydrophobic and hydrophilic granular surfaces have not been studied to date. In this study the effects of particle hydrophobicity on splash behaviour by a single water drop impact were examined using high-speed videography. Water drops (4 [*]mm in diameter) were dropped on beds of hydrophilic and hydrophobic glass beads (sieved range: 350 – 400 µm), serving as model soil particles. The drop velocity on impact was 2. 67 [*]m[*]s- 1, which corresponds to ~ 30 % of the terminal velocity of a raindrop of similar size. The resulting impact behaviour was measured in terms of the trajectories of particles ejected from the beds and their final resting positions. The response to the impacting water drop was significantly different between hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles in terms of the distance distribution, the median distance travelled by the particles and number of ejected particles. The greater ejection distances of hydrophobic particles were mainly the result of the higher initial velocities rather than differences in ejecting angles. The higher and longer ejection trajectories for hydrophobic particles, compared with hydrophilic particles, indicate that particle hydrophobicity affects splash erosion from the initial stage of rainfall erosion before a water layer may be formed by accumulating drops. The ~ 10 % increase in average splash distance for hydrophobic particles compared with hydrophilic particles suggests that particle hydrophobicity can result in greater net erosion rate, which would be amplified on sloping surfaces, for example, by <b>ridges</b> in <b>ploughed</b> agricultural soils or hillslopes following vegetation loss by clearing or wildfire...|$|R
40|$|In the {{original}} ridge tillage system as {{practiced in the}} US Corn Belt, ridges are formed during the growing season. Several studies have documented that this can reduce leaching of nutrients and improve fertilizer efficiency. This {{study was conducted to}} determine whether ridges formed in autumn can be used as an alternative to ploughing to reduce N leaching during autumn and winter, and thereby increase growth and N uptake of a subsequent unfertilized crop. A factorial field experiment with tillage and residues as factors was conducted during 1998 - 2000. Tillage treatments were autumn <b>ridging</b> and <b>ploughing.</b> Residue treatments were stubble, stubble+straw and stubble+liquid manure {{in order to create a}} gradient of C/N ratios. From the time of harvest until planting of a subsequent barley crop (Hordeum vulgare L.), inorganic N was determined 11 times in 1998 - 1999 and 10 times in 1999 - 2000 in the 0 - 10, 10 - 30, 30 - 60 and 60 - 90 cm soil layers. Growth and N uptake of barley was quantified 9 times in both 1999 and 2000. Barley grain and straw yields were determined. Ridging resulted in lower levels of inorganic N in the 30 - 90 cm soil layer in November and a significantly higher level of inorganic N in the 0 - 30 cm soil layer in late April, indicating reduced leaching and increased N availability for the subsequent crop. Ridging significantly increased growth, yield and N uptake of barley whereas incorporation of straw generally reduced growth, yield and N uptake. It is concluded that ridging in autumn has a N conserving effect and it is suggested that the potential of ridging in autumn as an alternative to ploughing is further investigated in detailed studies of solute movement, N immobiliza-tion/mineralization and crop performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the advantages}} and disadvantages of targeting soil conservation measures on the basis of off-site water quality goals. The Stratford Avon watershed in Perth County and the Big Creek watershed in Middlesex County, both located in southwestern Ontario, are used as case studies. Targeting criteria, used as proxies for measuring the contribution to offlfarm damage from particular parcels of crop land, are based on the physical characteristics of the parcels. Alternative conservation tillage practices include fall chisel <b>ploughing,</b> <b>ridge</b> planting, no tillage and buffer strips. At each level of the targeting criteria, the reduction in offyarm damage is estimated using the Guelph Model for Evaluating the Effects of Agricultural Management Systems on Erosion and Sedimentation (GAMES). Economic targeting criteria are based on the value of improved water quality under a conservation practice minus the onlfarm costs of adoption of that practice. Targeting conservation policies on the basis of reduction of offlfarm damages can result in greater eficiency in public policy. The authors conclude that further efforts in targeting conservation policies have the potential to improve the cost effectiveness of soil conservation programs if technical and adminis-trative problems can be overcome...|$|R
40|$|In field {{experiments}} on a sandy Psammentic Paleustalf in Niger, {{the effects on}} crop establishment and yield of pearl millet seed size (2. 12 mm), sowing depth (1, 3, 5 or 7 cm) and sowing method (sowing in hills or drilling seeds) with cv. CIVT and 3 / 4 HK (both improved) and Sadoré (local) given pre-sowing tillage (<b>ploughing,</b> <b>ridging,</b> 'sand fighting' or no-tillage) and application of 17 kg P + 40 kg N/ha upon seedling emergence, were observed. Sowing depth of 3 - 5 cm resulted in the highest percentage emergence, the highest shoot DW and most secondary roots. These growth parameters were greater in the > 2. 12 mm seed size category than in the other 2 smaller sizes. The adverse effects of wind erosion were least when sowing in hills; establishment, crop stand survival, and yield were better under hill planting than drilling seed. Pre-sowing tillage increased initial stands and their survival, the latter also depending on fertility. Thus, improving crop yields resulted from better stand survival and higher yields per hill. Application of P and N tripled grain yields. Ridging without prior tillage and ploughing increased grain and stover yields 2 - to 3 -fold. In combination with fertilizer application, 6 -fold yield increases were obtained. It was concluded that if pre-sowing tillage is considered, then, {{in view of the}} time limitations, ridging without prior tillage would be preferable to ploughing, as it is a much faster operation giving equally good results in terms of crop establishment and yiel...|$|R
40|$|Animal-drawn {{mouldboard}} ploughs are more expedient at controlling weeds among crops grown in rows than cultivators or hand labour. In Zimbabwe many smallholder farmers own just {{one piece of}} animal-drawn equipment, a mouldboard plough. To weed their maize and cotton crops they remove the mouldboard and cultivate with just the ploughshare. It means three or four passes {{up and down the}} row, and some hand weeding between plants. That requires some 85 labour hours/hectare, compared to 132 labour hours for just hand weeding. Using a proper cultivator reduces labour requirements to 68 hours/hectare. Research by the Silsoe Research Institute in collaboration with the Department of Research and Specialist Services in Harare Zimbabwe, is showing that even less labour is required if farmers do not remove the mouldboard from their ploughs. Using the complete plough takes 55 labour hours/ hectare, as the plough passes up and down the row just once. Hand weeding is eliminated at first weeding because the action of the <b>plough</b> <b>ridges</b> up the row-crops, smothering weeds around the plants in the process. Weeding with just the plough-share has other disadvantages. Yields seem to be lower than from crops that have been hand weeded or crops weeded with a cultivator.

40|$|AbstractSustaining soil {{productivity}} in agricultural systems presents a fundamental agroecological challenge: nutrient provisioning depends upon aggregate turnover and microbial decomposition {{of organic matter}} (SOM); yet to prevent soil depletion these processes must be balanced by those that restore nutrients and SOM (soil building processes). These nutrient provisioning and soil building processes are inherently in conflict; management practices that create spatial separation between them may enable each to occur effectively within a single growing season, thereby supporting high crop yield while avoiding soil depletion. Soil functional zone management (SFZM), an understudied but increasingly adopted strategy for annual row-crop production, may help meet this agroecological challenge by creating spatial heterogeneity in biophysical conditions between crop rows and inter-rows. However, the process-level effects of this spatial heterogeneity on nutrient provisioning and soil building processes have not been characterised. We assessed the magnitude and spatial distribution of nutrient provisioning and soil building processes in model SFZM (ridge tillage) and conventional tillage (chisel plough) systems in four US states encompassing a major global agricultural production region. For soil building we measured bulk density, aggregation and permanganate oxidisable carbon (POXC); for nutrient provisioning we measured microbial decomposition activity, nutrient mineralisation and plant-available nitrogen. After two years, POXC increased under ridge tillage (0 – 20 cm depth) compared with chisel <b>plough.</b> <b>Ridge</b> tillage also enhanced nutrient provisioning processes in crop rows, increasing plant-available nitrogen in synchrony with maize peak nitrogen demand. Structural equation modelling revealed that improvement in soil building processes under ridge tillage caused rapid enhancement of nutrient provisioning processes in SOM-poor soils. Increases in crop row POXC stimulated microbial decomposition activity, which was associated with increased plant-available nitrogen during the phase of maize peak nitrogen demand. The decimetre-scale spatial heterogeneity created by ridge tillage enables reconciliation of nutrient provisioning and soil building processes in row-crop agroecosystems. In doing so, ridge tillage promotes critical soil processes necessary for increasing the range of ecosystem services provided by intensive production systems. SFZM approaches may have particular value in regions with SOM-poor soils, which would benefit from rapid increases in surface organic carbon. Also, by concentrating and promoting nutrient provisioning processes around crop roots during crop peak nitrogen demand, ridge tillage may enhance nitrogen-use efficiency and reduce current fertiliser requirements...|$|R
