5000|$|Bimelech was foaled at Colonel E. <b>R.</b> Bradley's <b>Idle</b> Hour Stock Farm near Lexington, Kentucky. Colonel Bradley named {{this latest}} La Troienne foal after a friend, John Harris, who {{went by the}} {{nickname}} Abimelech. He dropped the [...] "A" [...] because he gave his horses names that began with a [...] "B". Bimelech was the last colt sired by Bradley's major stallion, Black Toney, and was a full brother to Black Helen, the 1935 Champion three-year-old filly. (Black Toney was also the sire of Hall of Famer Black Gold.) ...|$|R

He embarked on a professional training career in 1937 that would mainly involve operating public stables but also for renowned Kentucky owners, Claiborne and Calumet Farm. In 1966, Forrest won the first two legs of the U.S. Triple Crown races with Kauai King. He repeated the feat two years later in 1968 with Forward Pass [...] who would receive American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse honors.|$|R
5000|$|Busher was bred by Col. Edward <b>R.</b> Bradley's <b>Idle</b> Hour Stock Farm in Kentucky. She was sired by Triple Crown winner War Admiral, {{a son of}} Man o' War. Bradley had {{previously}} avoided using stallions from this sire line due to the reputation many had for being hot-blooded. [...] However, he was convinced to make an exception, in part because War Admiral physically resembled his maternal grandsire, Sweep, a horse that Bradley had long admired. Busher's dam Baby League was by Bubbling Over, winner of the 1926 Kentucky Derby. Baby League was the third foal {{of one of the}} most influential foundation mares of the twentieth century, La Troienne.|$|R
50|$|Black Toney was bred by James R. Keene's Castleton Farm. Keene, whose {{health was}} failing (he died in 1913), sold all his {{holdings}} in 1912 to Colonel Edward <b>R.</b> Bradley's <b>Idle</b> Hour Stock Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. Some confusion occurred over this sale, and Bradley resold {{most of the}} lot, but one of those he kept was a very dark brown yearling he named Black Toney. The price tag for the son of Hall of Famer Peter Pan, whose own sire was another Hall of Famer, Commando, by the great Domino, was $1,600. Black Toney's dam was Belgravia, the best daughter of Hall of Famer Ben Brush. This meant that the almost black yearling with no white markings and a fine head and body {{was a member of}} the last crop bred by Keene from his famous Domino/Ben Brush cross.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{introduces}} a bulk queucing {{system with a}} single server processing groups of customers of a variable size. If upon completion of service the queueing level is at least r the server takes a batch of size r and processes it a random time arbitrarily distributed. If the qucueing level is less than <b>r</b> the server <b>idles</b> until the queue accumulates r customers in total. Then the server capacity is generated by a random number equals the batch size taken for ser-vice which lasts an arbitrarily distributed time dependent on the batch size. The objective of {{the paper is the}} stationary distribution of queueing process which is studied via semi-regenerative techniques. An ergodicity criterion for the process is established and an explicit formula for the generating function of the distribution is obtained...|$|R
5000|$|Fall From Grace is an American {{alternative}} {{rock band}} formed in 2004 in Seattle, Washington. The band {{is best known}} for winning Fuse TV's reality show Bodog Music Battle of the Bands and winning a one million dollar recording contract with Bodog Music. Fall From Grace beat out over 7000 bands; ten of which they toured with for the prize. Those bands included new Bodog artists Boston's Fear Nuttin' Band, Miami's Big Bang Radio, Dallas's Ashmore, Houston's Subversa, Atlanta's The Mood, Minneapolis's Leroy Smokes, Los Angeles's Blaxmyth, Phoenix's <b>Idle</b> <b>Red,</b> San Francisco's Strifer, and Philadelphia's Burn Down All Stars. The band released their first major label album, Sifting Through the Wreckage, in 2008, and toured with Alesana to support the album.

40|$|We present {{modified}} {{sudden death}} test (MSDT) plans {{to address the}} problem of limited testing positions in life tests. A single MSDT involves testing k specimens simultaneously until the rth failure. The traditional sudden death test (SDT) is a special case when r = 1. The complete MSDT plan consists of g single MSDTs run in sequence. When r ? 1, there can be up to <b>r</b> Γ 1 <b>idle</b> test positions at any time. We propose testing "standby" specimens in the idle positions and use simulation to gauge the improvement over the basic MSDT plan. We evaluate test plans with respect to the asymptotic variance of maximum likelihood estimators of quantities of interest, total experiment duration and sample size. In contrast to traditional experimental plans, shorter total testing time and smaller sample sizes are possible under MSDT plans. KEYWORDS: Cornish-Fisher expansions, limited test positions, maximum likelihood methods, modified sudden death test, sudden death test, Type I and Type II cens [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The Post Office Bells(With {{apologies to}} the Poet Laureate)Ring forth, ye bells; begin to chime;Ring in the right, ring out the wrong;We've waited patiently and long;Ring, welcome bells it's nearly time.Ring out this never-ending rain— These floods that compass us about; Ring in a long-protracted drought, Till mud return to dust again.Then, six weeks hence, when things look dry. And thirsty meadows pray for rain, King in the long-lost floods again—But stop before they rise too high.Those carvings dire, that smirk and grin,Ring out, ring 'out without remorse;Ring out the Cyclorama horse;But ring the truer artist in.Ring out the empty fools that hoot To drown great {{speakers}} with their din;Or, if you can't do that, ring in The bludgeon {{and the heavy}} boot.Ring in a Parliament of peace, Ring out false charges, tricks unfair; Ring in obedience to the Chair, Ring out the all night gabbling geese.Ring out the men who try to baulk Those bills the country sorely needs Ring in a session of great deeds, <b>Ring</b> out obstruction, <b>idle</b> talk.Ring out our members' faults (begin With little Parliamentary fibs);Ring out the deficit of Dibbs, But ring a mighty surplus in.Ring out the members' midnight trams, That cost the country such a sum; Ring out the undue taste for rum That fires some legislative lambs.Ring out disunion; jealous blood That fetters young Australia's might; Ring out provincial petty spite; Ring in a broader brotherhood.Ring, mighty bells; make up lost time; Ring all the changes that you know. We want more changes here, I trow, Than you can give: begin to chime.Ring night and day, with clarion clang; Ring in the good; ring out the ill; But don't, as some folk say you will, Ring down the tower in which you hang.Robert Garran Whilst criticism of the carvings continued throughout {{the remainder of the}} construction, completion of the tower progressed smoothly. The finishing stone to the tower was laid in 1885. The press celebrated its completion, hailing [...] "the ornamentation of this façade of the building is in excellent taste, and artistic skill of the highest order has been exercised in carrying the designs." [...] Barnet was however unable to attend the stone laying ceremony for this completion, as he had travelled to Europe to make important notes on art and architecture, continuing research and observations to justify the designs of the Pitt Street carvings.|$|R
