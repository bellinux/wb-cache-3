40|$|Travel routing {{is vital}} for an {{efficient}} delivery {{of public and private}} services and the movement of people and goods. In Ghana, the major nature of travel routing is through the ‘trotro’ system. The trotro system uses an automobile to move people and goods along a prescribed travel route, with locally known stops where people get on and off the vehicle. The trotro system is significant because Ghana's road network and street addressing are imperfectly mapped. Thus, this paper critically evaluates the research challenges and opportunities for the development of an integrated trotro <b>geographic</b> <b>addressing</b> system. The widespread trotro address assignment and the availability of geolocation technology on mobile phones, make the integrated trotro <b>geographic</b> <b>addressing</b> framework an inexpensive and a comprehensive approach.

30|$|To {{accommodate}} such location aware forwarding, we {{introduce a}} hierarchical <b>geographic</b> <b>addressing</b> scheme with support for aggregation, named COST.

Moreover, such location information is disseminated between and stored in Controllers instead of border routers as in BGP or GIRO [14].
