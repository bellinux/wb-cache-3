40|$|Storied pattern, in the {{arrangement}} of both fusiform initials and the rays in cambium of Hippophae rhamnoides, develops in ontogeny relatively quickly and becomes clearly visible in terminal parenchyma of third and fourth annual ring. At first, anticlinal longitudinal divisions and restricted intrusive growth of fusiform initials lead {{to the formation of}} their characteristic horizontal tiers. Then, initiation of secondary rays, taking place rather within such tiers, not between them, makes possible the formation of storied ray pattern. New secondary rays originate most frequently from fusiform initials by their segmentation. This makes the appearance of ray tiers rather quick. However, the high order in the structure of cambium of Hippophae rhamnoides is also due to another, very curious and not known until now mechanism. It operates through limited in its range, thus highly controlled, vertical migration of rays on the cambial surface. This applies to asymmetrically positioned rays either primary, which are often originally sited "out of order" or secondary, initiated off-centre within the existing tiers. Excessively asymmetric rays, lying accidentally on the border between two neighbouring storeys, often undergo splitting and then the derivative rays move toward the centres of the storeys. Ray displacement is due to elimination of one or two of <b>ray</b> <b>initial</b> cells on one edge of the ray and simultaneous, multiple divisions adding new ray cells on the opposite edge...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Developmental {{changes in}} the storage organ of Brassica campestris L. were {{followed}} from {{the organization of the}} embryonic radicle and hypocotyl to the mature storage organ. Three independent primary meristems gave rise to the cortex, the stele, and the root cap-epidermis. The primary development is typical of the Cruciferae. Cambial activity was followed through serial tangential sections of the phloem from four areas of the storage organ; the crown, the hypocotyl, the upper root and the middle root. The anticlinal divisions of the crown's cambium were primarily longitudinal and transverse. The divisions in the hypocotyl, although greatly oblique had fewer 'longitudinal divisions. The cambium of the upper root had fewer longitudinal and greatly oblique anticlinal divisions. The anticlinal divisions of the middle root showed few greatly oblique divisions with most divisions being oblique to slightly oblique. New <b>ray</b> <b>initials</b> originated by transverse divisions of fusiform <b>initials.</b> Both <b>ray</b> and fusiform <b>initials</b> that were lost differentiated into parenchyma cells. Decline of fusiform initials was rare and in no case did <b>ray</b> <b>initials</b> originate in this fashion. As the storage organ expanded, interxylary phloem strands and vascular bundles appeared. Phloem strands differentiated following longitudinal divisions of the axial xylem parenchyma. As the organ enlarged, parenchyma cells surrounding the phloem strand divided, a cambium was formed, and tertiary phloem and xylem were produced. These interxylary vascular bundles formed a network which in the upper hypocotyl united to form a continuous band between the xylem and the pith. In the crown the vascular bundles of the basal leaves are bicolateral and the internal phloem is continuous with that of the interxylary phloem...|$|R

40|$|Vascular {{secondary}} growth {{results from the}} activity of the vascular cambium, which produces secondary phloem and secondary xylem. By means of cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) analysis along aspen stems, several potential regulatory genes involved in the progressive transition from primary to {{secondary growth}} were identified. A total of 83 unique transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) was found to be differentiated between the top and the bottom of the stem. An independent RT-PCR expression analysis validated the cDNA-AFLP profiles for 19 of the TDFs. Among these, seven correspond to new genes encoding putative regulatory proteins. Emphasis was laid upon two genes encoding, respectively, an AP 2 /ERF-like transcription factor (PtaERF 1) and a RING finger protein (PtaRHE 1); their differential expression was further confirmed by reverse northern analysis.

(sub-alpine fir) {{trees of}} {{comparable}} vigor growing in eastern British Columbia were studied {{in order to}} determine the effects of cork bark disease on phellogen and vascular cambium activity. Diseased trees form hard deeply fissured rhytidome several inches thick over large areas of the bole when phellogens that produce large increments of phellem form successively deeper in cortical and secondary phloem tissues. Expansion of the secondary xylem cylinder causes cracks to form in the rhytidome. Non-infested trees and areas above and below infested sites may retain their superficial phellogen for nearly 200 years and possess relatively thin layers of cork with a smooth surface texture. Phellem cells from diseased areas contain numerous fungal hyphae. Those from adjacent smooth bark areas and healthy trees are filled with phenolic compounds but are of different dimensions and lack hyphae. In addition infested areas show denser wood, significantly shorter tracheids, sieve cells and fusiform initials, greater frequency of fusiform initials dividing by anticlinical partitions, higher rate of new fusiform initial loss, and greater number of vertical albuminous cells.

Secondary vascular cambium behaves abnormally on the xylem side, by producing xylem and phloem in succession, resulting {{in the formation of}} interxylary phloem. It has a storied (sitratified) cambium organization, comprising short fusiform and isodiametric <b>ray</b> <b>initials.</b> The fusiform initials show characteristically beaded cell walls due to the presence of primary pit fields and are uninucleate.

In an young branch, however, it is initiated in March-April and reaches the peak in July and then declines till November. It once again showed an upward trend gradually. It appears that the initiation of the combial activity in this tree takes place by a hormone produced in the newly formed leaves, coupled with the high rainfall, enhanced relative humidity, optimum temperature, and short-day conditions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The balsam {{woolly aphid}} (Adelges piceae Ratz.) feeds by {{inserting}} its stylets intra- and intercellularly into the cortex or outer phloem of the true firs. While feeding, the aphid injects into the bark an unknown stimulatory substance which affects the adjacent cortical parenchyma cells, {{the activity of the}} vascular cambium and the differentiation of the xylem. This study examines non-infested, infested, and aphid-aban doned trees of grand fir (Abies grandis [Dougl. ] Lindl.) collected through the year by serial cross, radial, and tangential sections of the cortex, secondary phloem, cambium, and a portion of the xylem. The cortex of grand fir is composed mainly of parenchyma cells filled with resins, tannins, and sometimes crystals. Some of the parenchyma cells differentiate into astrosclereids. After infestation the cortex is characterized by hypertrophy of the nuclei and cortical parenchyma cells. As these cells enlarge into giant cells, there is an increase in density of the cytoplasm. Later a cork cambium is initiated around the pockets of giant cells. Reactivation and cessation of the cambium in infested, non-infested, and aphid-abandoned trees do not differ any more than the natural tree-to-tree variations that are due to location and exposure. The dormant cambium of infested trees maintains a wider radial file of cells in the cambial zone than do the cambiums of non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees. The cambium of infested trees generally produces more cells per year by increases in both periclinal and pseudotransverse divisions spread more or less evenly throughout the year. Pseudotransverse divisions in the non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees are generally limited to {{the latter half of the}} growing season. The sieve cells of the non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees are longer than those of the infested trees, but those of the infested trees are larger in radial width. The tangential widths do not vary. Rays are produced by anticlinal divisions of fusiform initials and by decline of fusiform initials. More declining tiers are noted in infested trees than in non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees. The fusiform initials decline to form one or more <b>ray</b> <b>initials.</b> In the latter case, the segmented initial produces two or more separate <b>ray</b> <b>initials</b> by unequal periclinal divisions and by maturation of some initials in the strand. The phloem rays usually accumulate a greater abundance of resins than do those of non-infested trees. The cambium of infested trees produces more tangential bands of phloem parenchyma cells and fiber sclereids than that of non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees. Traumatic resin ducts are initiated in the differentiating xylem, especially in heavily-infested trees. In the material examined, these were initiated in the spring, but they can occur at any time during the growing season. After prolonged presence of feeding aphids, phloem ray cells develop abnormalities such as dumbbell-shaped nuclei or a binucleate condition. Astrosclereids and resin cells were noted in all categories of trees studied. The astrosclereids were seen in all samples collected, whereas the resin cells appeared only in certain trees of the various categories...|$|R

40|$|The {{length and}} breadth of the cambial {{initials}} and their derivatives have been examined in Polyalthia longifolia, a tropical tree possessing non-storied cambium. Taking the average size of the initials and the elements originating from them, most of the sieve-tube elements {{have been found to}} be slightly shorter in length than the fusiform initials. On the other hand, a few of these are still shorter - almost half of the fusiform initials, due to transverse or somewhat oblique divisions in the sieve element mother cells. The vessel elements are slightly shorter but 5 - 6 times wider than the fusiform initials. The parenchyma strands, in phloem comprising cells storing starch or tannin (pps), in xylem accumulating starch only (ssps), are more or less equal to fusiform initials indicating that the xylem and phloem mother cells forming parenchyma cells have not undergone any major change except for transverse divisions. The individual vessel-associated parenchyma cells (v. a. p. cells) are wider but much shorter in length as compared to the starch-storing parenchyma cells (s. s. p. cells) indicating that more transverse divisions have occured in the strands of the former than those of the latter. Among all the cambial derivatives, the fibers exhibit maximum increase in length, due to intrusive growth.
