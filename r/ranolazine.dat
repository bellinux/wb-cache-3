5000|$|Ventricular myocytes are {{heart muscle}} cells {{found in the}} lower {{chambers}} of the heart. Heart rate {{is dependent on the}} movement of an electrical stimulus through the individual heart cells. This is mediated by the opening of ion channels on cell surfaces. HBI-3000 exerts its effects on the heart by inhibiting multiple ion channels (INa-F, INa-L, ICa-L and IKr), but predominantly the INa-L ion channel [...] By decreasing the ion permeability of these channels, HBI-3000 slightly prolongs APD (due to IKr); however, unlike pure IKr channel blockers, it is self-limited (due to the decreased permeability of INa-L and ICa-L). This is similar to the medications <b>ranolazine</b> and amiodarone. HBI-3000 suppresses early afterdepolarizations (EADs; a change in the normal net flow of ions during repolarization), does not produce any electrical abnormalities, and displays minimally pronounced prolongation of APD during a slow heart rate (i.e. stimulated at a slower frequency). Pronounced prolongation of APD during a slow heart rate can lead to proarrythmias. Overall, HBI-3000 seems to have a low proarrhythmic risk. The effect of HBI-3000 on contractility and cardiac conduction requires further investigation.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether <b>ranolazine</b> therapy improves exercise-induced {{angina pectoris}} and myocardial ischemia compared with placebo or with standard doses of atenolol {{in patients who}} had chronic angina and evaluated the effects on hemodynamics at rest and during exercise. In this trial, 158 patients who had symptom-limited exercise discontinued beta-blocker therapy and were randomized into a double-blind, 3 -period, crossover study of 400 mg of immediate-release <b>ranolazine</b> 3 times daily, 100 mg/day of atenolol, or placebo, each administered for 1 week. Exercise tests were administered {{at the end of}} each treatment period. Therapy with <b>ranolazine</b> or atenolol produced statistically significant improvement in all 3 exercise end points compared with placebo.

40|$|Current therapies those {{alleviate}} angina {{frequency and}} increase the threshold at which demand-induced myocardial ischemic symptoms become evident include drugs (nitrates, β-blockers, calcium antagonists), exercise conditioning, enhanced external counterpulsation, and coronary revascularization. This review will focus on sustained-release <b>ranolazine,</b> a drug that reduces angina symptoms, with a mechanism of action {{different from that of}} currently available pharmacological therapies. Conventional oral dosage formulations are not ideally suited to <b>ranolazine</b> because the solubility of <b>ranolazine</b> is relatively high at the low pH that occurs in the stomach. Furthermore <b>ranolazine</b> also has a relatively short plasma half-life. The high acid solubility property of <b>ranolazine</b> results in rapid drug absorption and clearance, large and undesirable fluctuations in plasma concentration of <b>ranolazine</b> and a short duration of action, necessitating frequent oral administration for adequate treatment. Thus making it into an extended release formulation becomes the sole solution. <b>Ranolazine</b> is used in patients with chronic angina who continue to be symptomatic on β-blockers, calcium antagonists, or nitrates. <b>Ranolazine</b> blocks late inward sodium currents in cardiomyocytes.

40|$|Chronic stable angina is an {{exceedingly}} prevalent condition with tremendous clinical, social, and financial implications. Traditional medical therapy for angina consists of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates. These agents decrease myocardial oxygen demand and ischemia by reducing heart rate, lowering blood pressure, and/or optimizing ventricular loading characteristics. Unique in its mechanism of action, <b>ranolazine</b> {{is the first}} new antianginal agent approved {{for use in the}} US for chronic angina in over 25 years. By inhibiting the late inward sodium current (INa), <b>ranolazine</b> prevents pathologic intracellular calcium accumulation that leads to ischemia, myocardial dysfunction, and electrical instability. <b>Ranolazine</b> has been proven in multiple clinical trials to reduce the symptoms of angina safely and effectively and to improve exercise tolerance in patients with symptomatic coronary heart disease. These benefits occur without reduction in heart rate and blood pressure or increased mortality. Although <b>ranolazine</b> prolongs the QTc, experimental data indicate that <b>ranolazine</b> may actually be antiarrhythmic. In a large acute coronary syndrome clinical trial, <b>ranolazine</b> reduced the incidence of supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and bradycardic events. Additional benefits of <b>ranolazine</b> under investigation include reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin levels and improved left ventricular function. <b>Ranolazine</b> is a proven antianginal medication in patients with symptomatic coronary heart disease, and should be considered as an initial antianginal agent for those with hypotension or bradycardia...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ranolazine</b> {{is a novel}} anti-ischemic {{drug that}} prolongs the QT interval. To {{evaluate}} the potential mechanisms and consequences, we studied: (i) Ranolazine's effects on HERG and IsK currents in Xenopus oocytes with two-electrode voltage clamp; (ii) effects of <b>ranolazine,</b> compared to D-sotalol, on effective refractory period (ERP), QT interval and ventricular rhythm in a dog model of acquired long QT syndrome; and (iii) effects on selected native currents in canine atrial myocytes with whole-cell patch-clamp technique. <b>Ranolazine</b> inhibited HERG and IsK currents with different potencies. HERG was inhibited with an IC 50 of 106 μmol l− 1, whereas the IC 50 for IsK was 1. 7 mmol l− 1. D-Sotalol caused reverse use-dependent ERP and QT interval prolongation, whereas <b>ranolazine</b> produced modest, nonsignificant increases that plateaued at submaximal doses. Neither drug affected QRS duration. D-Sotalol had clear proarrhythmic effects, with all D-sotalol-treated dogs developing torsades de pointes (TdP) ventricular tachyarrhythmias, of which they ultimately died. In contrast, <b>ranolazine</b> did not generate TdP. Effects on IKr and IKs {{were similar to those}} on HERG and IsK. <b>Ranolazine</b> blocked ICa with an IC 50 of ∼ 300 μmol l− 1. INa was unaffected. We conclude that <b>ranolazine</b> inhibits IKr by blocking HERG currents, inhibits ICa at slightly larger concentrations, and has modest and self-limited effects on the QT interval. Unlike D-sotalol, <b>ranolazine</b> does not cause TdP in a dog model. The greater safety of <b>ranolazine</b> may be due to its ability to inhibit ICa at concentrations only slightly larger than those that inhibit IKr, thus producing offsetting effects on repolarization...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE:: The {{antianginal}} <b>ranolazine</b> {{blocks the}} human ether-a-go-go-related gene-based current IKr at therapeutic concentrations and causes QT interval prolongation. Thus, <b>ranolazine</b> is contraindicated {{for patients with}} preexisting long-QT and those with repolarization abnormalities. However, with its preferential targeting of late INa (INaL), patients with disease resulting from increased INaL from inherited defects (eg, long-QT syndrome type 3 or disease-induced electric remodeling (eg, ischemic heart failure) might be exactly the ones to benefit most from the presumed antiarrhythmic properties of <b>ranolazine.</b> OBJECTIVE:: We developed a computational model to predict if therapeutic effects of pharmacological targeting of INaL by <b>ranolazine</b> prevailed over the off-target block of IKr {{in the setting of}} inherited long-QT syndrome type 3 and heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS:: We developed computational models describing the kinetics and the interaction of <b>ranolazine</b> with cardiac Na channels in the setting of normal physiology, long-QT syndrome type 3 -linked ΔKPQ mutation, and heart failure. We then simulated clinically relevant concentrations of <b>ranolazine</b> and predicted the combined effects of Na channel and IKr blockade by both the parent compound <b>ranolazine</b> and its active metabolites, which have shown potent blocking effects in the therapeutically relevant range. Our simulations suggest that <b>ranolazine</b> is effective at normalizing arrhythmia triggers in bradycardia-dependent arrhythmias in long-QT syndrome type 3 as well tachyarrhythmogenic triggers arising from heart failure-induced remodeling. CONCLUSIONS:: Our model predictions suggest that acute targeting of INaL with <b>ranolazine</b> may be an effective therapeutic strategy in diverse arrhythmia-provoking situations that arise from a common pathway of increased pathological INaL. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc...|$|E
