500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war Richardson joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a sub-lieutenant pilot. He had taken flying lessons during the 1930s and had logged 200 hours of flying time, but, though a notoriously <b>reckless</b> <b>driver,</b> he admitted to being a timid pilot. He counted himself lucky to have been accepted, but the Fleet Air Arm was short of pilots. He rose {{to the rank of}} lieutenant-commander. His work was mostly routine administration, probably because of [...] "the large number of planes which seemed to fall to pieces under his control", through which he acquired the nickname [...] "Pranger" [...] Richardson. He served at several bases in the south of England, and in April 1941, at the Royal Naval Air Station, Lee-on-Solent, he was able to welcome Olivier, newly commissioned as a temporary sub-lieutenant. Olivier rapidly eclipsed Richardson's record for pranging.|$|E
500|$|On July 19, 2014, {{police in}} Northwest Virginia {{received}} calls regarding a <b>reckless</b> <b>driver,</b> and then observed a Ford Bronco travelling at high speed. Gonzalez initially tried to flee after troopers {{tried to make}} him pull over; he drove his vehicle off the road into a highway median. After searching his vehicle, police found a sawed-off shotgun, two rifles and four handguns, as well as ammunition and a tomahawk. They also found a map of Washington, D.C. with a circle drawn around the White House. Gonzalez was arrested for eluding police and possessing a sawed-off shotgun. He said he failed to stop because he had an [...] "Iraqi moment": a [...] "flashback" [...] that was triggered by the lights and sirens of the police car. Virginian police informed both the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Secret Service about the arrest. Secret Service agents subsequently interviewed Gonzalez though he was deemed {{not to be a}} threat. On August 25, Secret Service agents approached Gonzalez at the White House fence after noticing a small hatchet in his waistband. Agents searched his car and found two dogs, two more hatchets, camping equipment, and empty gun cases, though no guns or ammunition. Secret Service agents interviewed Gonzalez again; they were aware that he had been interviewed by other agents the previous month. He was still deemed to not be a threat.|$|E
2500|$|Brian's {{death was}} the main focus in the season twelve episode [...] "Life of Brian".

As he is setting it up, Brian is struck by a <b>reckless</b> <b>driver</b> in a hit and run and later succumbs to his injuries at the veterinary clinic. Stewie is unable to rebuild the time machine as he cannot acquire a new power supply. After a month of mourning {{the loss of their}} beloved pet, the family replaces Brian with a new dog, named Vinny. The death of Brian in the episode [...] "Life of Brian" [...] was met with massive opposition and anger from Family Guy fans around the world, many of whom threatened to boycott the show due to Brian's absence. Family Guy's official Facebook and Twitter pages were bombarded with messages and comments from fans demanding that they bring Brian back. Hostile messages were also directed towards Family Guy's producing staff, including the show's creator, Seth MacFarlane. MacFarlane later thanked fans [...] "for caring so much about the canine Griffin, he is overcome with gratitude." [...] Fan petitions sprang up within hours of [...] "Life of Brian"'s first airing, also receiving media attention including most prominently a Change.org petition directed towards Seth MacFarlane, making the petition one of the fastest-growing entertainment-related petitions on the site, attracting over 120,000 signatures.|$|E

50|$|The {{people of}} Karachi use minibuses, coaches, and large buses. They are often cramped and {{filled to the}} brim.

30|$|Further, {{as shown}} in Fig.  18, it is notable that both {{cautious}} and <b>reckless</b> <b>drivers</b> produced outliers. On one hand, through an off-line analysis, {{it is possible to}} notice an opposing behavior in relation to speed. Cautious drivers remained below the speed limit in 75 % of the speed samples while the <b>reckless</b> <b>drivers</b> remained within the speed limit only in 25 % of the samples, {{as shown in}} Fig.  18 (left). On the other hand, by performing an online speed analysis, in particular, the online Z-score algorithm analysis, we noted that sudden changes identified by outliers in cautious drivers’ speed occurred at low speeds, as shown in Fig.  18 (right). Half of the sudden changes occurred in a range between 8 and 43  km/h and 25 % of sudden changes occurred in a range between 43 and 54  km/h. It would be valuable to carry out a study to identify the motivation for this behavior. Moreover, <b>reckless</b> <b>drivers</b> exhibited no sudden changes in speeds lower than 40  km/h, as shown in Fig.  18 (right). However, 50 % of outliers related to speed occurred above 60  km/h. Another point of note is that even considering driving at extremely high speeds (120  km/h), outliers occurred only up until 75  km/h. These data show that speed is appropriate for classifying driver behavior and the online outlier detection approach is a good alternative for classifying drivers as cautious or reckless.|$|R

[...] but candour compels the admission {{that she was a}} somewhat <b>reckless</b> <b>driver.</b> Perhaps it was due to some atavistic tendency. One of her ancestors may have been a Roman charioteer or a coach-racing maniac of the Regency days. At any rate, after a hard morning's work on her new book she felt that her mind needed cooling, and found that the rush of air against her face effected this satisfactorily. The greater the rush, the quicker the cooling. However, as the alert inhabitants of Manhattan Island, a hardy race trained from infancy to dodge taxicabs and ambulance wagons, had always removed themselves from her path with their usual agility, she had never yet had an accident.|$|E
6000|$|And {{truly the}} <b>reckless</b> <b>driver</b> did [...] "go" [...] {{just at that}} moment. He {{came up to the}} corner of the new fence, where the road took a rather abrupt turn, in a style that ensured a capsize. In another second the {{spirited}} horse turned sharp round, the sleigh turned sharp over, and the occupant was pitched out at full length, while a black object, that might have been mistaken for his hat, rose from his side like a rocket, and, flying over him, landed on the snow several yards beyond. A faint shout was heard to float on the breeze as this catastrophe occurred, and the driver was seen to jump up and readjust himself in the cariole; while the other black object proved itself not to be a hat by getting hastily up on a pair of legs, and scrambling back to the seat from which it had been so unceremoniously ejected.|$|E
50|$|Reckless {{driving is}} often {{defined as a}} mental state in which the driver {{displays}} a wanton disregard for {{the rules of the}} road; the driver misjudges common driving procedures, often causing accidents and other damages.

60|$|Beatrice did {{not know}} that her own face was tense and white. The {{accident}} had been unexpected and unnerving. She was shaken by its suddenness and by a dread she could not explain: it was no time for analysis of feelings. She was watching the trail with desperate concentration, wondering whether the wagon and its <b>reckless</b> <b>driver</b> would break out from the trees. In a moment they did appear--the team going downhill at a mad gallop, Harding lashing them with a loop of the reins. There is not often a brake on a prairie wagon, and as the chain that locked the wheels had obviously broken, Harding's intention was plain. He meant to keep the horses ahead of the iron load that would overturn the wagon and mangle the animals if it overtook them. This warranted his furious speed. But the trail was narrow and tortuous, and with the heavy weight spread over a long wheel-base, the wagon was hard to steer. Beatrice realized this, but in spite of her horror she felt a thrill of fierce approval.|$|E

Then, sir, I took my seat on the outside of the coach, and felt that I held our safety in my own hands. For a time I allowed our vehicle to proceed; but when we approached this long slope which stretches before us, and our horses showed signs of increasing impetuosity, I leaned forward, hooked the handle of my umbrella in the ring of the bolt, and with a mighty effort jerked it out. I admit to you, sir, that I had overlooked the fact that the horses were also attached to the end of the pole, but I have often noticed that when we are discreet in judgment and prompt in action we are also fortunate. Thus was I fortunate. The hindermost horses, suddenly released, rushed upon those in front of them, and, in a manner, jumbled up the whole team, which seemed to throw the animals into such terror that they dashed to one side and snapped off the pole, after which they went madly tearing down the road, entirely beyond the control of the two riders. Our coach turned and ran into the side of the road with but a moderate concussion, and as I looked at those flying steeds, with their riders vainly endeavoring to restrain them, I could not, sir, keep down an emotion of pride that I had been instrumental in freeing myself, my daughter, and my traveling companions from their dangerous proximity." ...|$|E

The {{moment that}} we began to go down-hill I {{perceived}} that we were in a position of the greatest danger. The driver was reckless, the boy incompetent, and the horses unmanageable. As my remonstrances and counsels had no effect upon the man, and as you seemed to have no desire to join me in efforts to restrain him to a more prudent rate of speed, I determined to take the affair into my own hands. I knew that the first thing to be done was to rid ourselves of those horses. So long as we were connected with them disaster was imminent. I knew exactly what ought to be done. The horses must be detached from the coach. I had read, sir, of inventions especially intended to detach runaway horses from a vehicle. To all intents and purposes our horses were runaways, or would have become so in a very short time. I now made it my object to free ourselves from those horses. I got out at our first stop and thoroughly examined the carriage attachments.
