5|$|While Madvillainy {{achieved}} only moderate commercial success, {{it still}} {{became one of}} the label's best-selling albums. The album peaked at number 179 on the US Billboard 200, and attracted much attention from media outlets not usually covering hip hop music, including The New Yorker. Madvillainy received <b>rave</b> <b>reviews</b> from most music critics, who praised both DOOM's lyricism and Madlib's production.

5|$|Forging a {{collaboration}} with Scorsese, the two paired {{again for a}} biopic of the eccentric and obsessive American film director and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). Centering on Hughes' life from the late 1920s to 1947, DiCaprio initially developed the project with Michael Mann, who decided against directing it after back-to-back film biographies in Ali and The Insider. The actor eventually pitched John Logan's script to Scorsese, who quickly signed on to direct. The Aviator became a critical and financial success. DiCaprio received <b>rave</b> <b>reviews</b> for his performance and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, also receiving another Academy Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Juster had {{received}} a Ford Foundation grant for a children's book about cities. Unable to make progress on that project, he turned to writing what became The Phantom Tollbooth, his first book. His housemate, Feiffer, a cartoonist, interested himself in the project. Jason Epstein, an editor at Random House, bought the book and published it. The book received <b>rave</b> <b>reviews</b> and has sold in excess of three million copies, far more than expected. It has been adapted into a film, opera, and play, and translated into many languages.|$|E
5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} 12 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 60,000 copies {{in its first}} week.

Aquemini peaked at number two on both the Billboard 200 and the Top R/Hip-Hop charts. Four of the album's tracks had already or would later become singles, although some were limited (promotional) releases and not available commercially.

5|$|The film {{primarily}} {{revolves around}} {{the relationship between a}} father and son, in which the father's excessive concern for his son, and interference in his life, leads to the latter harbouring bitterness towards his overbearing father.

5|$|A {{critical}} and commercial success in 1990, Fear of a Black Planet sold two {{million copies in}} the United States and received <b>rave</b> <b>reviews</b> from critics, many of whom named {{it one of the}} year's best albums. Its immediate success contributed significantly to the popularity of Afrocentric and political subject matter in hip hop and the genre's mainstream resurgence at the time. Since then, it has been viewed as one of hip hop's greatest and most important records, as well as being musically and culturally significant. In 2003, Fear of a Black Planet was ranked number 300 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and in 2005, the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were also}} a Broadway {{production}} in 1903 and international tours. The New York Times gave the show a <b>rave</b> <b>review</b> after its opening night in New York: [...] "It is just possible {{that there have been}} better musical comedies ... but if there have, nobody in the audience could think of them {{at the end of the}} evening.... It was the marvel of ... good looks, good dancing, and good acting working together for the common weal." [...] The paper particularly praised the humour of G. P. Huntley and Maurice Farkoa. The title characters were played in New York by Maggie May, Madge Crichton, and Delia Mason. [...] Another <b>rave</b> <b>review</b> was published in the New York Dramatic Mirror.|$|R

5|$|On February 25, 1969, Pacino {{made his}} Broadway debut in Don Petersen's Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie? at the Belasco Theater {{produced}} by A Heir Huntington Hartford.

Pacino continued performing onstage in the 1970s, winning a second Tony Award for The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel and performing the title role in Richard III. In the 1980s, Pacino again achieved critical success on stage while appearing in David Mamet's American Buffalo, for which Pacino {{was nominated for a}} Drama Desk Award.

5|$|The Princess Theatre opened as a single-screen cinema on March 8, 1915 to <b>rave</b> <b>reviews.</b> It {{had cost}} McKernan CDN$75,000 {{and had taken}} 10 months to build, longer than expected. The theatre opened with 660 seats and the largest live {{performance}} stage in a cinema west of Winnipeg. It {{was at the time}} the only cinema on Edmonton’s south side, and would keep that title until the opening of the Garneau Theatre in 1940. Opening night was a benefit concert for The Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, associated with the 19th Alberta Dragoons, B Squad. The program proudly included newsreels “featuring actual war scenes”. In audience were the Lt. Governor and Mayor W.T. Henry. The house’s first feature film, The Eagle’s Mate starring Mary Pickford, was screened the following night.|$|E
5|$|For {{the part}} of bordello-keeper Fauna, the duo fixed on the famous diva, Helen Traubel. There was {{precedent}} for such casting—former opera star Ezio Pinza had starred as suave Frenchman Emile de Becque in South Pacific, and had received <b>rave</b> <b>reviews</b> for his performance. Traubel, {{in addition to being}} well known for her Wagnerian roles, was also noted for her nightclub singing. In 1953, the new Metropolitan Opera impresario, Rudolf Bing, feeling that she was lowering the tone of the house, declined to renew her contract. Hammerstein had seen Traubel at her first appearance at the Copacabana nightclub in New York, and afterwards had gone backstage to predict to Traubel that she would be coming straight to Broadway. He saw her show again in Las Vegas several months later, and offered her the part. When offered the role, Traubel eagerly accepted, though she later noted that she had never represented herself as much of an actress.|$|E
50|$|Stretch Panic {{received}} mixed reviews. GameGo! magazine {{featured the}} game {{on the cover of}} its first issue, and gave it a <b>rave</b> <b>review,</b> while Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it 4.9/10. In Japan, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 30 out of 40.|$|R

5000|$|The band's debut {{received}} a <b>rave</b> <b>review</b> in Option magazine.

It begs to be listened to throughout." ...|$|R
5|$|Blues harpist Cyril Davies ran the London Skiffle Club at the Roundhouse {{public house}} in London’s Soho, {{which served as}} {{a focal point for}} British skiffle acts. Like guitarist Alexis Korner, he had worked for Chris Barber, playing in the R segment Barber {{introduced}} to his show and as part of the supporting band for visiting US artists. They began to play together as a duo and in 1957, deciding their central interest was blues, they closed the skiffle club and reopened a month later as The London Blues and Barrelhouse Club. It acted as a venue for visiting artists and their own performances. The visit of Muddy Waters in 1958 had a major impact on the duo and on the nature of British R in general. Initially British audiences were shocked by Waters's amplified electric blues, but he was soon playing to ecstatic crowds and receiving <b>rave</b> <b>reviews.</b> Where British blues had often emulated Delta blues and country blues in the emerging British folk revival, Davies and Korner, who had supported Waters on tour, now began to play high-powered electric blues, forming the band Blues Incorporated.|$|E
5|$|Drunken Angel {{is often}} {{considered}} the director's first major work. Although the script, {{like all of}} Kurosawa's occupation-era works, {{had to go through}} forced rewrites due to American censorship, Kurosawa felt that this was the first film in which he was able to express himself freely. A grittily realistic story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster (yakuza) with tuberculosis, it was also the director's first film with Toshiro Mifune, who would proceed to play either the main or a major character in all but one (Ikiru) of the director's next 16 films. While Mifune was not cast as the protagonist in Drunken Angel, his explosive performance as the gangster so dominates the drama that he shifted the focus from the title character, the alcoholic doctor played by Takashi Shimura, who had already appeared in several Kurosawa movies. However, Kurosawa did not want to smother the young actor's immense vitality, and Mifune's rebellious character electrified audiences in much the way that Marlon Brando's defiant stance would startle American film audiences a few years later. The film premiered in Tokyo in April 1948 to <b>rave</b> <b>reviews</b> and was chosen by the prestigious Kinema Junpo critics poll as the best film of its year, the first of three Kurosawa movies to be so honored.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Lansbury {{returned}} to London's West End {{to perform in}} the Royal Shakespeare Company's theatrical production of Edward Albee's All Over at the Aldwych Theatre. She portrayed the mistress of a dying New England millionaire, and although the play's reviews were mixed, Lansbury's acting was widely praised. This was followed by her reluctant involvement in a revival of Mame, which was then touring the United States, after which she {{returned to}} the West End to play the character of Rose in the musical Gypsy. She had initially turned down the role, not wishing to be in the shadow of Ethel Merman, who had portrayed the character in the original Broadway production, but eventually accepted it; when the show started in May 1973, she earned a standing ovation and <b>rave</b> <b>reviews.</b> Settling into a Belgravia flat, she was soon in demand among London society, having dinners held in her honour. Following the culmination of the London run, in 1974 Gypsy went {{on a tour of the}} U.S., and in Chicago Lansbury was awarded the Sarah Siddons Award for her performance. The show eventually reached Broadway, where it ran until January 1975; a critical success, it earned Lansbury her third Tony Award. After several months' break, Gypsy then toured throughout the country again in the summer of 1975.|$|E
