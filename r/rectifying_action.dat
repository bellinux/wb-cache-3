50|$|The {{principle}} of {{operation of a}} metal rectifier is related to modern semiconductor rectifiers (Schottky diodes and p-n diodes), but somewhat more complex. Both selenium and copper oxide are semiconductors, in practice doped by impurities during manufacture. When they are deposited on metals, it would be expected that {{the result is a}} simple metal-semiconductor junction and that the rectification would be a result of a Schottky barrier.However, this is not always the case: the scientist S. Poganski discovered in the 1940s that the best selenium rectifiers were in fact semiconductor-semiconductor junctions between selenium and a thin cadmium selenide layer, generated out of the cadmium-tin metal coating during processing.In any case the result {{is that there is a}} depletion region in the semiconductor, with a built-in electric field, and this provides the <b>rectifying</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E

Recent developments in Australia attempt to assure that those Australian corporations listed on the Australian share market will in the future more fully consider the social consequences of their actions and will implement strategies to avoid the risks which such actions would present.

30|$|In this paper, a new <b>rectifying</b> <b>action</b> was {{introduced}} into various PD^α-type ILC schemes and the tracking performances against the initial state shift were investigated {{for a class}} of fractional order linear systems. The proposed PD^α-type ILC schemes were shown to be an extended form of first- and second-order as well as feedback-based PD^α-type ILC schemes. The tracking performances were analyzed {{in the form of}} the Lebesgue-p norm by the technique of the generalized Young inequality of the convolution integral and fractional integration by parts. These analyses show that effect of the initial state shift can be more effectively controlled in various ways and the tracking performances can be improved according to the proper choice of the learning gains.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, a new <b>rectifying</b> <b>action</b> is {{combined}} into different proportional-α-order-derivative-type iterative learning control algorithms {{for a class}} of fractional order linear time-invariant systems. Unlike the existing fractional order iterative learning control techniques, the proposed algorithms allow the initial state value of a fractional order iterative learning control system at each iteration to shift randomly. By introducing the Lebesgue-p norm and using the method of fractional integration by parts and the generalized Young inequality of convolution integral, the tracking performances {{with respect to the}} initial state shift under the proposed algorithms are analyzed. These analyses show that the tracking errors are incurred by such a shift and improved by tuning the rectifying gain. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.|$|E

The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to consider the initial state shift for a class of fractional order linear systems, and then incorporate a <b>rectifying</b> <b>action</b> into various proportional-α-order-derivative-type ILC algorithms to alleviate the tracking error caused by such a shift. The algorithms include the first- and second-order as well as feedback-based proportional-α-order-derivative-type ILCs. It is also important to note that many new theoretic analysis methods are explored to analyze the tracking performance in the sense of the Lebesgue-p norm.|$|E

Panchanan Chakraborty with his associates backed Subhas in his campaign against the notorious Holwell Monument in Kolkata, as well as in his criticism of the Wartime Congress policy. Once again, along with Subhas Bose and his supporters, Panchanan Chakraborty went to prison in 1940.

50|$|John Maynard Keynes in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money argued {{during the}} Great Depression {{that the loss}} of output by the private sector {{as a result of a}} {{systemic}} shock (the Wall Street Crash of 1929) ought to be filled by government spending. First, he argued that with a lower ‘effective aggregate demand’, or the total amount of spending in the economy (lowered in the Crash), the private sector could subsist on a permanently reduced level of activity and involuntary unemployment, unless there were active intervention. Business lost access to capital, so it had dismissed workers. This meant workers had less to spend as consumers, consumers bought less from business, which because of additionally reduced demand, had found the need to dismiss workers. The downward spiral could only be halted and <b>rectified</b> by external <b>action.</b> Second, people with higher incomes have a lower marginal propensity to consume their incomes. People with lower incomes are inclined to spend their earnings immediately to buy housing, food, transport and so forth, while people with much higher incomes cannot consume everything. They save instead, which means that the velocity of money, meaning the circulation of income through different hands in the economy, is decreased. This lowered the rate of growth. Spending should therefore target public works programmes on a large enough scale to speed up growth to its previous levels.|$|R
50|$|Since CASA {{serves to}} model {{functionality}} {{parts of the}} auditory system, {{it is necessary to}} view parts of the biological auditory system in terms of known physical models. Consisting of three areas, the outer, middle and inner ear, the auditory periphery acts as a complex transducer that converts sound vibrations into action potentials in the auditory nerve. The outer ear consists of the external ear, ear canal and the ear drum. The outer ear, like an acoustic funnel, helps locating the sound source. The ear canal acts as a resonant tube (like an organ pipe) to amplify frequencies between 2-5.5 kHz with a maximum amplification of about 11dB occurring around 4 kHz. As the organ of hearing, the cochlea consists of two membranes, Reissner’s and the basilar membrane. The basilar membrane moves to audio stimuli through the specific stimulus frequency matches the resonant frequency of a particular region of the basilar membrane. The movement the basilar membrane displaces the inner hair cells in one direction, which encodes a half-wave <b>rectified</b> signal of <b>action</b> potentials in the spiral ganglion cells. The axons of these cells make up the auditory nerve, encoding the rectified stimulus. The auditory nerve responses select certain frequencies, similar to the basilar membrane. For lower frequencies, the fibers exhibit “phase locking”. Neurons in higher auditory pathway centers are tuned to specific stimuli features, such as periodicity, sound intensity, amplitude and frequency modulation. There are also neuroanatomical associations of ASA through the posterior cortical areas, including the posterior superior temporal lobes and the posterior cingulate. Studies have found that impairments in ASA and segregation and grouping operations are affected in patients with Alzheimer's disease.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of exploiting motile microorganisms as tiny propellers represents a fascinating {{strategy for the}} transport of colloidal cargoes. However, delivery on target sites usually requires external control fields to steer propellers and trigger cargo release. The need for a constant feedback mechanism prevents the design of compact devices where biopropellers could perform their tasks autonomously. Here we show that properly designed three-dimensional microstructures can define accumulation areas where bacteria spontaneously and efficiently store colloidal beads. The process is stochastic in nature and results from the <b>rectifying</b> <b>action</b> of an asymmetric energy landscape over the fluctuating forces arising from collisions with swimming bacteria. As a result, the concentration of colloids over target areas can be strongly increased or depleted according to the topography of the underlying structures. Besides the significance to technological applications, our experiments pose some important questions regarding the structure of stationary probability distributions in non-equilibrium systems. Colloidal particles undergo perpetual Brownian motion resulting from the stochastic and rapid collisions with solvent molecules. As a result, an ensemble of colloidal particle...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic energy harvesting, i. e., {{capturing}} {{energy from}} ambient microwave signals, may become an essential part in extending the battery lifetime of wearable devices. Here, we present a design of a microwave energy harvester based on a cut-wire metasurface with an integrated PN junction diode. The cut wire with a quasistatic electric-dipole moment is designed to have a resonance at 6. 75 GHz, leading to a substantial cross-section for absorption. The external microwaves create a unidirectional current through the <b>rectifying</b> <b>action</b> of the integrated diode. Using an electrical-circuit model, we design the operating frequency and the resistive load of the cut wire. Subsequently, by optimizing our design using full-wave numerical simulations, we obtain an energy harvesting efficiency of 50 % for incident power densities {{in agreement with the}} typical power density of WiFi signals. Finally, we study the effect of connecting adjacent unit cells of the metasurface in parallel by a thin highly inductive wire and we demonstrate that this allows for the collection of current from all individual cells, while the microwave resonance of the unit cell is not significantly altered, thus solving the wiring problem that arises in many nonlinear metamaterials.

40|$|A {{transient}} {{decrease in}} excitability occurs regularly during the S 1 phase of threshold electrotonus to depolarizing conditioning stimuli for sensory and, less frequently, motor axons. This has {{been attributed to}} the outwardly <b>rectifying</b> <b>action</b> of fast K+ channels, at least in patients with demyelinating diseases. This study investigates the genesis of this notch in healthy axons. Threshold electrotonus was recorded for sensory and motor axons in the median nerve at the wrist in response to test stimuli of different width. The notch occurred more frequently the briefer the test stimulus, and more frequently in sensory studies. In studies on motor axons, the notch decreased in latency and increased in amplitude as the conditioning stimulus increased or the limb was cooled. Low-threshold axons displayed profound changes in strength–duration time constant even though the threshold electrotonus curves contained no detectable notch. When a 1. 0 ms current was added to subthreshold conditioning stimuli to trigger EMG, the notch varied with the timing and intensity of the brief current pulse. This study finds no evidence for an outwardly rectifying deflection due to K+ channels, other than the slow accommodation attributable to slow K+ currents. In normal motor axons, a depolarization-induced notch during the S 1 phase of threshold electrotonus {{is the result of the}} conditioning stimulus exceeding threshold for some axons. The notch is more apparent in sensory axons probably because of the lower slope of the stimulus–response curve and their longer strength–duration time constant rather than a difference in K+ conductances. This may also explain the notch in demyelinating diseases...|$|E

Also, the sample sizes required for establishing control charts are often under discussion depending on the field of study. Of late, the problem of Fuzziness and Randomness often brought into modern manufacturing processes by the shortening product life cycles and diversification (in product designs, raw material supply etc) has compelled researchers to invoke quality control methodologies in their search for high customer satisfaction and better market shares (Guo et al 2006).
