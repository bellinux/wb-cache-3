For instance, the economy can fluctuate, fresh social trends can bring change and new innovations can shift the course of where society is headed. In 1999 Verganti conducted a research of companies’ ability of incorporating flexibility into innovation processes.

He argued that depending on the environment of the industry in which the company operates, different degrees of <b>reaction</b> <b>capabilities</b> were required.

The aim {{of this study is to}} question whether the conclusion Verganti reached in 1999 still holds, or if projects solely relying on reactive capabilities actually can succeed in today’s market. Interviews were conducted with two different project leaders operating projects within the vehicle and computer programming industry respectively.

Chapter 1 provides a general introduction to protein analysis by MS, ion/ion reactions and ion/ion reaction instrumentation, and IMS techniques and IMS instrumentation. Chapter 2 describes the construction and performance of a linear ion trap (LIT) made with primarily commercially available components. The LIT has two ion sources for independent analyte ion and reagent ion formation. The LIT functions as a reaction vessel for gas-phase ion/ion reactions and as a mass spectrometer using mass-selective axial ejection. Initial experiments demonstrate the LIT 2 ̆ 7 s ability to perform both dual polarity storage mode and transmission mode proton transfer ion/ion reactions. Chapter 3 describes the construction and performance of an IT-IMS-q-TOF with three independent ion sources. This instrument is the first MS to combine ion/ion <b>reaction</b> <b>capabilities</b> with IMS-q-TOF analysis.

40|$|Abstract. In {{dynamically}} changing environments, {{the performance of}} a standard evolutionary algorithm deteriorates. This {{is due to the fact}} that the population, which is considered to contain the history of the evolutionary process, does not contain enough information to allow the algorithm to react adequately to changes in the tness landscape. There-fore, we added a simple, global case-based memory to the process to keep track of interesting historical events. Through the introduction of this memory and a storing and replacement scheme we were able to improve the <b>reaction</b> <b>capabilities</b> of an evolutionary algorithm with a periodically changing tness function. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Advanced {{business}} processes are mostly distributed and require highly flexible management capabilities. In such scenarios, process parts often leave their initiator’s direct {{sphere of influence}} – while management requires both monitoring as well as instant <b>reaction</b> <b>capabilities</b> anytime during the overall execution of the process. However, realizing such functions is often difficult, e. g. due to the heterogeneity and temporal disconnectivity of participating execution systems. Therefore, this contribution proposes a two-tier concept for monitoring and controlling distributed processes by representing a process management system as a manageable resource according to the WSDM standard. Based on a minimal shared model of management capabilities it allows to define customized events and processing rules for influencing {{business processes}} executed on a remote (and even on a temporarily disconnected) process management system. Applicability is demonstrated by a scenario-based evaluation on distributed WS-BPEL and XPDL processes. ...|$|R
