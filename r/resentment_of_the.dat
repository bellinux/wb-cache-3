5|$|The Chinese at Rock Springs {{were aware}} of the {{animosity}} and rising racial tension with white miners, but had not taken any precautions, as no prior events indicated there would be any race riots. Underlying the outbreak of violence were racism and <b>resentment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> policies of the Union Pacific Coal Department. Until 1875, the mines in Rock Springs were worked by whites; in that year, a strike occurred, and the strikers were replaced with Chinese strikebreakers less than two weeks after the strike began. The company resumed mining with 50 white miners and 150 Chinese miners in its employ. As more Chinese arrived in Rock Springs, bitterness from the white miners increased. At the time of the massacre, there were about 150 white miners and 331 Chinese miners in Rock Springs.|$|E

5|$|Names {{of three}} poets from the 11th century {{and some of}} their poems are available. Madara Chennaiah, a cobbler turned saint, is {{considered}} by H.S.

Only ten of Chennaiah's poems, expressing his <b>resentment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caste system in metaphors taken from the cobblers' trade, are extant today. Dohara Kakkaiah is the second poet. A dalit by birth, his six available poems are confessional in nature, a theme seen in the later poems of Basavanna. Devara Dasimaiah (or Jedara Dasimaiah, 1040) is better known because a hundred and fifty of his poems are available. Written in a deft and concise language of proverbs and metaphors, his poems encourage monotheistic belief in the god Shiva. Dasimaiah's wife Duggale qualifies as Kannada's first women poet, though only a few of her poems are available.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of one Macedonian incursion, during which border guards are killed, Dumitriu is ordered to round up and execute {{a number of his}} Bulgarian prisoners. Horrified by this random reprisal, Marie-Thérèse strives to have them pardoned and released, but her plea only serves to irritate her husband's {{superiors}}. Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels, whereas they would prefer an extrajudicial killing. The resulting toll on Dumitriu's career means that they are forced to leave Southern Dobruja, shortly before which the captain's colleagues make public their <b>resentment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> couple. The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that, as Hungarians, both women are natural suspects in Romania. It is {{a result of}} this that Dumitriu decides to commit suicide, unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple, and ultimately falling of the stool (which his mare had chewed on) and weeping uncontrollably. This episode, Simon points out, was not present in the original text, and was invented by Pintilie to underline the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive. In what is one of the closing scenes, Marie-Thérèse is stoned by those Bulgarian women whose husbands had been executed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation {{that created a}} predominately Calvinist national kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook; the Reformation severely reduced the powers of bishops, but did not abolish them. In the earlier part of the century, the teachings of first Martin Luther and then John Calvin began to influence Scotland, particularly through Scottish scholars who had visited continental and English universities and who had often trained in the Catholic priesthood. The influence of the English was also more direct, as they supplied books and distributed Bibles and Protestant literature in the Lowlands when they invaded in 1547. Particularly important {{was the work of}} the Lutheran Scot Patrick Hamilton. His execution with other Protestant preachers in 1528, and of the Zwingli-influenced George Wishart in 1546, who was burnt at the stake in St. Andrews on the orders of Cardinal Beaton, did nothing to stem the growth of these ideas. Wishart's supporters, who included a number of Fife lairds, assassinated Beaton soon after and seized St. Andrews Castle, which they held for a year before they were defeated with the help of French forces. The survivors, including chaplain John Knox, were condemned to be galley slaves, helping to create <b>resentment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French and martyrs for the Protestant cause.|$|E
5|$|In 743, {{after the}} death of Caliph Hisham, Walid II {{reconfirmed}} Nasr in his post, but the influential governor of Iraq, Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi, an opponent of Nasr, tried to lure him away from his province by calling him to Iraq. Nasr delayed his departure, stalling for time, and was saved by the murder of Walid in April 744. However, Walid's successor, Yazid III, moved to install a regime dominated by the Yemeni Kalbi tribe. Nasr's position was severely undermined, and the Yemeni faction now hoped to see their leader Juday' al-Kirmani appointed governor in his stead. Indeed, Yazid appointed his favourite, the Kalbi Mansur ibn Jumhur, as governor of Iraq, and he in turn nominated his own brother as Nasr's replacement. Nasr refused to accept this, and was again fortunate in his persistence, for Mansur fell out of favour and was dismissed after only two months. Agitation among the Yemeni faction persisted, amidst rumours that Nasr had intercepted letters appointing al-Kirmani as governor, and a dispute on the payment of stipends to the muqatila. Nasr tried to secure his own position by deposing al-Kirmani from his leadership of the Azd, as well as by trying to win over Azd and Rabi'ah leaders. This led to a general uprising by the Azd and Rabi'ah under al-Kirmani. It is indicative of the lingering intertribal antagonism of the late Umayyad world that the rebellion was launched in the name of revenge for the Muhallabids, an Azd family that had been purged after rebelling in 720, an act which had since become a symbol of Yemeni <b>resentment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Umayyads and their northern Arab-dominated regime.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor {{offences}} that harm private {{interest or}} have a limited social impact, <b>the</b> Criminal Code <b>of</b> 1969 provided <b>the</b> withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial complaint and the settlement by the parties. <b>The</b> draft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romanian Criminal Code, submitted for approval to Parliament, tacitly repeals <b>the</b> institution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> settlement <b>of</b> parties, which, as <b>the</b> founder <b>of</b> Romanian criminal law argued, “may be more useful for restoring legal order and prevent other disturbances that may have stemmed from <b>the</b> lingering <b>resentments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two subjects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> litigation. ”In most modern criminal laws {{we can no longer}} find the explicit settlement by parties, but rather the presumed settlement inferred from the withdrawal or abandonment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criminal complaint. In Romanian criminal law, over time, offences for which settlement was possible have varied from one era to another. In the Sturdza Codex, settlement was possible and considered as mitigating. In the proposed Criminal Code bill of 2004, settlement by the parties also existed. The will to reach a settlement by the parties may be determined by Christian reasons.

40|$|Philosophers {{writing on}} {{forgiveness}} typically defend <b>the</b> <b>Resentment</b> Theory <b>of</b> Forgiveness, <b>the</b> view that forgiveness is <b>the</b> overcoming <b>of</b> <b>resentment.</b> Rarely {{is much more}} said about <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>resentment</b> or how it is overcome when one forgives.

40|$|I examine in {{this paper}} <b>the</b> {{experience}} <b>of</b> "resentment" in Chinese and European ethical thinking, particularly in early Confucian ethics and in Nietzsche's genealogy of ressentiment. Self-cultivation is articulated in the Analects in light of issues <b>of</b> recognition and <b>resentment.</b> In contrast to European discourses <b>of</b> recognition and <b>resentment,</b> <b>the</b> compilers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Analects recognized <b>the</b> pervasiveness <b>of</b> <b>resentment</b> under certain social conditions and the ethical demand to counter it both within oneself and in relation to others. In early Confucian ethics, resentment is understood in a variety <b>of</b> senses. Overcoming <b>resentment</b> in oneself and in others is a primary element of becoming a genuinely exemplary or noble person in the ethical sense; the ignoble person by contrast is fixated {{on his or her}} own limited and self-interested concerns. Whereas contemporary Western ethical theory typically assumes that symmetry and equality are <b>the</b> primary means <b>of</b> overcoming <b>resentment,</b> I examine how <b>the</b> asymmetrical recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> priority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other appears necessary for overcoming resentment in the Analects. Early Confucian ethics integrates a nuanced and realistic moral psychology <b>of</b> <b>resentment</b> and <b>the</b> ethical self-cultivation necessary for dismantling it in promoting a condition of humane benevolence.

40|$|How ought we to {{evaluate}} and respond to expressions <b>of</b> anger and <b>resentment?</b> Can philosophical analysis <b>of</b> <b>resentment</b> as <b>the</b> emotional expression <b>of</b> a moral claim help us to distinguish which resentments ought to be taken seriously? Philosophers have {{tended to focus on}} what I call ‘reasonable’ resentments, presenting a technical, narrow account that limits <b>resentment</b> to <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> recognizable moral claims. In the following paper, I defend three claims about the ethics and politics <b>of</b> <b>resentment.</b> First, if we care about socially just processes of reconciliation, we have good reason to pay attention to <b>the</b> logic <b>of</b> <b>resentments.</b> Second, <b>the</b> account philosophers offer <b>of</b> <b>resentment</b> – its distinctive features, aims, rationality, and gratification – will affect the conclusions we draw about which actual resentments to take seriously, which aspects of resentful claims need addressing, {{and what it means to}} address and repair them. In contesting definitions <b>of</b> <b>resentment,</b> I argue, we do more than simply perform housekeeping in philosophical taxonomies of emotion. Restricting our understanding to essentially ‘moral’ cases may cause us to lose sight <b>of</b> expressly political <b>resentments.</b> 	Instead, I argue, a plausible account <b>of</b> <b>resentment</b> must acknowledge that we resent violations and threats that are not necessarily self-pertaining, may not be expressible as individual, discrete injuries, and cannot always be construed as moral threats. Second, given <b>the</b> dependence <b>of</b> moral judgments on a broader horizon of moral possibility, philosophical standards of ‘reasonable’ or ‘appropriate’ resentment cannot avoid being politically charged. Thus, the widely accepted account <b>of</b> ‘reasonable’ <b>resentment</b> cannot make philosophical sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most interesting and perplexing cases. Ironically, a theoretical measure designed to revalue emotional expressions of moral protest may result in the exclusion and silencing <b>of</b> those with <b>the</b> most reasons to protest...|$|R
