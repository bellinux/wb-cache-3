50|$|An early {{successful}} teleprinter {{was invented}} by Frederick G. Creed. In Glasgow he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (<b>receiving</b> <b>perforator)</b> and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was {{the origin of the}} Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the Daily Mail for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.|$|E
50|$|Working in the company’s {{office in}} Iquique, Chile, he became tired of using {{hand-operated}} Morse keys and Wheatstone tape punches, {{and came up}} with the idea of a typewriter-style machine that would allow the operator to punch Morse code signals onto paper tape simply by pressing the appropriate character key. Creed quit his job and moved to Glasgow, Scotland, where he began work in an old shed. Using an old typewriter bought from the Sauchiehall Street market, he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (<b>receiving</b> <b>perforator)</b> and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals onto paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 Creed & Company, {{founded by}} Frederick G. Creed, entered the {{teleprinter}} field with their Model 1P, a page printer, which was soon superseded by the improved Model 2P. In 1925 Creed acquired the patents for Donald Murray's Murray code, a rationalised Baudot code. The Model 3 tape printer, Creed’s first combined start-stop machine, {{was introduced in}} 1927 for the Post office telegram service. This machine printed received messages directly on to gummed paper tape {{at a rate of}} 65 words per minute. Creed created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (<b>receiving</b> <b>perforator)</b> and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the Daily Mail for daily transmission of the newspaper contents. The Creed Model 7 page printing teleprinter was introduced in 1931 and was used for the inland Telex service. It worked at a speed of 50 baud, about 66 words a minute, using a code based on the Murray code.|$|E
