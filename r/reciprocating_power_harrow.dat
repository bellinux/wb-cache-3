40|$|Farmers try {{to reduce}} steps of soil {{preparation}} by using subsoiler and then following by equipment for soil pulverization such as a rotary tiller and a <b>power</b> <b>harrow</b> which take advantage of using a power take-off of a tractor. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to compare the tilling performances of a rotary tiller and a <b>power</b> <b>harrow</b> applying after subsoiling. The results showed that both the rotary tiller and the <b>power</b> <b>harrow</b> had negative slip, indicating that they generated force to push a tractor. The rotary tiller created negative vertical force to lift up the tractor whereas opposite result was found when using the <b>power</b> <b>harrow.</b> Since working depths were different, vertical forces, torques and PTO powers for two equipment types were significantly different. However, {{no significant differences were found}} for the forward speeds, slips, drawbar pulls and drawbar powers. Comparative analysis showed that two equipment types had significant difference in PTO power to working depth, drawbar power to working depth, PTO power to working area, drawbar power to working area and soil pulverization...|$|R

50|$|A blacksmith's striker is an {{assistant}} (frequently an apprentice), {{whose job it is}} to swing a large sledgehammer in heavy forging operations, as directed by the blacksmith. In practice, the blacksmith holds the hot iron at the anvil (with tongs) in one hand, and indicates where to strike the iron by tapping it with a small hammer in the other hand. The striker then delivers a heavy blow to the indicated spot with a sledgehammer. During the 20th century and into the 21st century, this role has become increasingly unnecessary and automated through the use of trip hammers or <b>reciprocating</b> <b>power</b> hammers.|$|R
40|$|The wear {{resistance}} of rotary plows {{operating in a}} clay loam soil was studied. The degree of damage caused to the soil {{and the amount of}} mass lost by the tools were determined in order to establish correlations between the physical properties of the soil and the wear mechanisms acting on the tribosystem. Field tests were carried out in 12 plots and a randomized experimental design with 4 levels, 3 replicas per level and 2 passes per plot was applied. The levels relate to the tillage implements employed: rotary tiller, rotary <b>power</b> <b>harrow,</b> small motorized rotary tiller and control (unaltered soil). The highest mass losses were measured in rotary tiller and rotary <b>power</b> <b>harrow's</b> tools, while the small motorized rotary tiller's tools showed generally lower levels of damage. It was determined that the effective contact time between tool and soil, the rotating speed and the sudden impact forces are the most significant factors affecting the {{wear resistance}} in field operations. Thirty days after tillage operation the soil samples were taken from each plot at a mean depth of 100 mm in order to determine bulk density, gravimetric moisture content and percentage of aggregates smaller than 5 mm. No significant differences among the values of these properties were found in the experiments. The wear mechanisms acting on the tools' surface are complex and include 2 -body and 3 -body abrasion as well as the presence of sudden impact forces...|$|R
40|$|LectureThe {{dynamics}} (movement) of {{the check}} valves in a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>power</b> pump {{determine whether the}} pump will operate quietly and smoothly, or noisily with pulsation and vibration. Although piping pulsation and vibration are, to a degree, function of the system design, improper pump valve dynamics contribute {{a significant portion of}} the pulsation problems in many installations. Many <b>reciprocating</b> <b>power</b> pumps, operating in industrial installation, have been found to be fitted with suction and discharge valve springs that are too weak. The weak springs do not close the valves soon enough, as the plunger reverses, causing the valves to be slammed onto their seats, creating a noisy pump, hydraulic shocks, and possible damage to the valves and/or seats. The hydraulic shocks can also cause damage to other pump components, the drive train, and to the system. Suction and discharge pipes may vibrate, piping and instruments may be damaged, and pump net positive suction head (NPSH) requirements may be high. To reduce the pulsations and vibrations, owners frequently resort to the installation of pulsation dampening equipment in the piping, when stronger valve springs may have been adequate to produce a quiet, smooth-running pump. Starting with either the maximum valve lift, or the maximum closing impact velocity, simple equations of motion can approximate the displacement (lift), velocity, and acceleration of the valve, all based on crankshaft rotative speed. The maximum lift can then be used to calculate the NPSH required by the pump...|$|R

50|$|The {{steam turbine}} was {{developed}} by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884. His first model was connected to a dynamo that generated 7.5 kW (10 hp) of electricity. The invention of Parson's steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionized marine transport and naval warfare. By the time of Parson's death, his turbine had been adopted for all major world power stations. Unlike earlier steam engines, the turbine produced rotary <b>power</b> rather than <b>reciprocating</b> <b>power</b> which required a crank and heavy flywheel. The large number of stages of the turbine allowed for high efficiency and reduced size by 90%. The turbine's first application was in shipping followed by electric generation in 1903.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a 6 -phase permanent-magnet flux-reversal linear {{machine for}} {{low-speed}} <b>reciprocating</b> <b>power</b> generation is presented. By increasing the phase number, the phase current is reduced {{for the same}} rated power which results in a lower ohmic loss. In addition, the thrust force ripple can be reduced accordingly. By borrowing the transverse-flux concept, the electric loading and the magnetic loading is decoupled and the thrust density can be improved accordingly. The stator of the proposed machine adopts the modular design, and each phase is magnetically decoupled with each other which gives more flexibility and controllability of the generator. Based on the same topology, the proposed machine can be extended to a machine with an arbitrary number of phase to suit different applications. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The {{transmission of the}} power from the pistons to the rails and the behaviour of the locomotive as a vehicle, being able to negotiate curves, points and irregularities in the track, is of paramount importance. Because <b>reciprocating</b> <b>power</b> has to be directly applied to the rail from 0rpm upwards, this creates the problem of adhesion of the driving wheels to the smooth rail surface.

Eighty-four human single-rooted mandibular premolars were hand instrumented using Triple-Flex stainless-steel files (Kerr) up to # 30, weighed in analytical balance and randomly assigned to 4 groups (n= 21). All specimens were mechanically prepared at the working length with # 35 to # 45 Triple-Flex files (Kerr) coupled to a NSK (TEP-E 10 R, Nakanishi Inc.) <b>reciprocating</b> handpiece <b>powered</b> by an electric motor (Endo Plus; VK Driller). Groups 1 to 4 were prepared by a professor of Endodontics, an endodontist, a third-year dental student and a general dentist, respectively. Teeth were reweighed after root canal preparation. The difference between weights was calculated and the means of dentin removal in each group were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test at 5 % significance level. The greatest amount of dentin removal was found in group 4, followed by groups 2, 3 and 1. Group 4 differed statistically from the other groups regarding dentin removal means [p< 0. 001 (group 1); p= 0. 005 (group 2); and p= 0. 001 (group 3) ]. No statistically significant difference was found between groups 1 and 2 (p= 0. 608), 1 and 3 (p= 0. 914) and 2 and 3 (p= 0. 938). In conclusion, although the group prepared by a general dentist differed statistically from the other groups in terms of amount of dentin removal, this difference was clinically irrelevant.

Studies conducted in New Zealand generally suggest low N 2 O emission from pasture; however, there is little information for arable farming systems. This paper evaluates tillage and land use effects on N 2 O emissions using a closed chamber technique at an Ohakea silt loam (Gleyic luvisol) where winter oats (Avena sativa L.) /fodder maize (Zea mays L.) was double-cropped for 5 years. The tillage types included conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, and a permanent pasture (PP) was used as a control. Spatial variability in all treatments showed large inherent variations in N 2 O fluxes (a mean CV = 119 %), which reflected natural soil heterogeneity, and perhaps the measurement technique used rather than the real differences due to the tillage and cropping systems evaluated. On an annualised basis, N 2 O emissions measured from December 1998 to September 1999 from the PP (1. 66 kg N 2 O-N/ha per year or 19 g N 2 O-N/(m 2 h)) were significantly lower than the CT and NT fields averaging at 9. 20 (or 105) and 12. 0 (or 137) kg N 2 O-N/ha per year (org N 2 O-N/(m 2 h)), respectively. However, there were no differences in N 2 O emission rates between the CT and NT treatments. Seedbed preparation using a <b>power</b> <b>harrow</b> which followed within a few days of first ploughing the CT field reduced N 2 O emissions by 65 % within the first hour after power harrowing.
