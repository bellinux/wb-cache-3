5|$|In October 2014 1,308 GCHQ staff {{formed a}} giant <b>red</b> <b>poppy</b> in the Doughnut's central {{courtyard}} {{to mark the}} start of the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal. The poppy was 38m in size with a 28m long stalk. The staff wore red rain ponchos, with the black centre of the poppy formed by the uniforms of Royal Navy personnel. The Doughnut was illuminated with yellow light to mark GCHQ staff's support for Guide Dogs and by a spectrum of colours to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. An annual Community Day is held at the Doughnut to highlight the charitable and volunteer work by GCHQ staff in the local Cheltenham community.|$|E

Since it blooms in spring, there was a day dedicated to the <b>red</b> <b>poppy</b> called the “Lunes de amapolas,“ which is the day after Easter Sunday. However, this tradition ended when poppy cultivation was banned in 1940.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} {{controversy}} in the lead-up to the official opening, {{with a lack of}} forthcoming funds to pay for the projected £700,000 cost of the ceremony. A number of veterans put forward their own money as security for the event, making them liable for the costs if donations did not cover the total. The Ministry of Defence drew criticism for not providing any money, in particular the Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond, who would be attending. A number of veterans had also missed out on applying for tickets in the early stages, although many other parties returned theirs to allow them to attend. Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the memorial on 28 June 2012, unveiling the bronze sculpture. The ceremony was attended by 6,000 veterans and family members of those killed, and the Avro Lancaster of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight dropped <b>red</b> <b>poppy</b> petals over Green Park.|$|E

500|$|... "In Flanders Fields" [...] is {{very popular}} in Canada, where it is a staple of Remembrance Day ceremonies and {{may be the most}} well known {{literary}} piece among English Canadians. It has an official French adaptation, entitled , written by Jean Pariseau and used by the Canadian government in French and bilingual ceremonies. With an excerpted appearance on the ten-dollar bill from 2001 to 2013, the Royal Canadian Mint has released poppy-themed quarters on several occasions. A version minted in 2004 featured a <b>red</b> <b>poppy</b> in the centre and is considered the first multi-coloured circulation coin in the world. To mark the poem's centennial in 2015, a coloured and uncoloured poppy quarter and a [...] "toonie" [...] ($2 coin) were issued as circulation coins, as well as other collector coins. Among its uses in popular culture, the line [...] "to you from failing hands we throw the torch, be yours to hold it high" [...] has served as a motto for the Montreal Canadiens hockey club since 1940.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by [...] "In Flanders Fields", American {{professor}} Moina Michael resolved at the war's {{conclusion in}} 1918 {{to wear a}} <b>red</b> <b>poppy</b> year-round to honour the soldiers {{who had died in}} the war. She also wrote a poem in response called [...] "We Shall Keep the Faith". She distributed silk poppies to her peers and campaigned to have them adopted as an official symbol of remembrance by the American Legion. Madame E. Guérin attended the 1920 convention where the Legion supported Michael's proposal and was inspired to sell poppies in her native France {{to raise money for the}} war's orphans. In 1921, Guérin sent poppy sellers to London ahead of Armistice Day, attracting the attention of Field Marshal Douglas Haig. A co-founder of The Royal British Legion, Haig supported and encouraged the sale. The practice quickly spread throughout the British Empire. The wearing of poppies in the days leading up to Remembrance Day remains popular in many areas of the Commonwealth of Nations, particularly Great Britain, Canada and South Africa and in the days leading up to ANZAC Day in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|On October 21, 2004, the Royal Canadian Mint {{unveiled}} a 25¢ poppy coin.

It is the world's first coloured coin.

2500|$|The Mint states that, {{with normal}} wear and tear, the colour should remain {{for a number}} of years, {{although}} this claim was quickly disproved [...] The colouration compounds are attached to the metal on a specially prepared 'dimpled' section of the coin, and seem to come off easily if deliberately rubbed. The coin will retain its full value even if the <b>red</b> <b>poppy</b> has worn off or been removed; however it is now expected that fully coloured specimens will become collectible in the future.|$|E

In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the Communist regime in the country started to tolerate the Bulgarian [...] "bards", promoting the so-called [...] "political songs", performed usually by one-man bands. A national festival tradition was established, under the title [...] "Alen Mak" [...] (<b>Red</b> <b>Poppy),</b> a symbol with strong Communist meaning in Bulgaria.

2500|$|In 1872 J.T. van der Berg of Utrecht in the Netherlands, {{received}} {{a shipment of}} seeds and plants from a friend in Mexico. The entire shipment was badly rotted {{and appeared to be}} ruined, but van der Berg examined it carefully and found a small piece of root that seemed alive. He planted and carefully tended it; it grew into a plant that he identified as a dahlia. He made cuttings from the plant during the winter of 1872-1873. This was an entirely different type of flower, with a rich, red color and a high degree of doubling. In 1874 van der Berg catalogued it for sale, calling it Dahlia juarezii to honor Mexican President Benito Pablo Juarez, who had died the year before, and described it as [...] "...equal to the beautiful color of the <b>red</b> <b>poppy.</b> Its form is very outstanding and different in every respect of all known dahlia flowers.".|$|E
6000|$|... 9. I {{have in my}} hand a small <b>red</b> <b>poppy</b> which I {{gathered}} on Whit Sunday on the palace of the Cæsars. It is an intensely simple, intensely floral, flower. All silk and flame: a scarlet cup, perfect-edged all round, seen among the wild grass far away, like a burning coal fallen from Heaven's altars. You cannot have a more complete, a more stainless, type of flower absolute; inside and outside, all flower. No sparing of colour anywhere--no outside coarsenesses--no interior secrecies; open as the sunshine that creates it; fine-finished on both sides, down to the extremest point of insertion on its narrow stalk; and robed in the purple of the Cæsars.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more the}} hum of the bee was heard booming over the grass, and from the shadow of the tree there emerged a dainty being whose attire glittered in the moonlight, and whose step was like that of a proud monarch. He was clad in a many-hued coat made of wings of dragon flies, a green vest cut from a downy {{mouse-ear}} leaf, and with buttons of buttercup buds; little knee-breeches of fine-spun silk dyed in the juice of a whinberry, stockings of cobweb, and shoes of shining beetle case; his shirt, which was as white as falling snow, had been cut from convolvulus flowers ere they had opened to the light; and his hat, a gem of a thing fit only for a fairy, was of <b>red</b> <b>poppy,</b> with a waving white feather, and a band of fur from a caterpillar. He led by the hand another personage, equally daintily dressed, but of a higher order of loveliness, with a pale oval face, and dreamy-looking eyes, gleaming like the sea when the moon and stars are bending over its bosom, and the wind is whispering its sad secrets. Her hair was golden, and rippled almost to her exquisite feet, and over it she wore a blue cornflower wreath, with diamond dewdrops here and there amid the leaves. Her dress was of damask rose leaves looped up with myosotis.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Burger King {{introduced}} a commercial in Russia, {{in which a}} Whopper was shown crushing <b>red</b> <b>poppies,</b> and the dialogue [...] "This is a poppy.

[...] However, major Russian broadcasters rejected the ad due to concerns over its possible insinuation that the Whopper was better than drugs, as <b>red</b> <b>poppies</b> {{are in the same}} plant family as the source of heroin. The company refused to comment of the veracity of the networks' claims, and instead posted the advertisement on its YouTube channel, eventually pulling it from that service as well.|$|R
60|$|Their pleasures {{on these}} {{excursions}} were simple enough. A crust {{of bread and}} scrap of meat, with water from the brook or spring, sufficed for their repast. Barnaby's enjoyments were, to walk, and run, and leap, till he was tired; then to lie down in the long grass, or by the growing corn, or {{in the shade of}} some tall tree, looking upward at the light clouds as they floated over the blue surface of the sky, and listening to the lark as she poured out her brilliant song. There were wild-flowers to pluck--the bright <b>red</b> <b>poppy,</b> the gentle harebell, the cowslip, and the rose. There were birds to watch; fish; ants; worms; hares or rabbits, as they darted across the distant pathway in the wood and so were gone: millions of living things to have an interest in, and lie in wait for, and clap hands and shout in memory of, when they had disappeared. In default of these, or when they wearied, there was the merry sunlight to hunt out, as it crept in aslant through leaves and boughs of trees, and hid far down--deep, deep, in hollow places--like a silver pool, where nodding branches seemed to bathe and sport; sweet scents of summer air breathing over fields of beans or clover; the perfume of wet leaves or moss; the life of waving trees, and shadows always changing. When these or any of them tired, or in excess of pleasing tempted him to shut his eyes, there was slumber {{in the midst of all}} these soft delights, with the gentle wind murmuring like music in his ears, and everything around melting into one delicious dream.|$|E
6000|$|... "... And I {{find that}} the Monacha Rosea (Red Rattle is its name, besides [...] the ugly one) is a perennial, {{and several of the}} other draconidæ, [...] foxglove, etc., are biennials, born this year, {{flowering}} and dying next [...] year, and the size of roots is generally proportioned to the life of [...] plants; except when artificial cultivation develops the root specially, [...] as in turnips, etc. Several of the Draconidæ are parasites, and suck [...] the roots of other plants, and have only just enough of their own to [...] catch with. The Yellow Rattle is one; it clings to the roots of the [...] grasses and clovers, and no cultivation will make it thrive without [...] them. My authority for this last fact is Grant Allen; but I have [...] observed for myself that the Yellow Rattle has very small white [...] sucking roots, and no earth sticking to them. The toothworts and broom [...] rapes are Draconidæ, I think, and wholly parasites. Can it be that the [...] Red Rattle is the one member of the family that has 'proper pride, and [...] is self supporting'? the others are mendicant orders. We had what we [...] choose to call the Dorcas flower show yesterday, and we gave, as usual, [...] prizes for wild flower bouquets.
