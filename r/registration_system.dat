African countries should be encouraged to establish expert teams to critically review their national civil <b>registration</b> <b>systems</b> in terms of the legal framework, organisational issues, system design, training needs and quality control issues. Country level expert teams should examine the feasibility of innovative approaches such as sample <b>registration</b> <b>systems</b> and verbal autopsy questionnaires should be used as interim measures to obtain data for policy and planning.

These include the roles of land policy, legislation, flexible tenures, institutions, spatial data infrastructures and capacity building.
