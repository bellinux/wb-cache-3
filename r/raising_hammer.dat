Though uncommon, some of the later items, such as plates, may have started as spun but were then hammered.|$|R

60|$|He {{lifted the}} pistol from the table, {{examining}} its mechanism. He rose and {{walked across the}} room till he stood with {{his back against the}} door, the pistol in his hand, its barrel pointing straight at Marsden's heart. Marsden never moved. Then as the two men faced one another thus, looking into one another's eyes, their ears caught a sound from behind the closed door of the inner room--a sharp, hard, metallic sound as if some one in the room within had <b>raised</b> the <b>hammer</b> of a pistol--a jewelled pistol like the one in Dangerfield's hand.|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} type of forging {{equipment}} is the hammer and anvil. Principles behind the hammer and anvil are still used today in drop-hammer equipment. The principle behind the machine is simple: <b>raise</b> the <b>hammer</b> and drop it or propel it into the workpiece, which rests on the anvil. The main variations between drop-hammers are in the way the hammer is powered; the most common being air and steam hammers. Drop-hammers usually operate in a vertical position. The main reason for this is excess energy (energy that isn't used to deform the workpiece) that isn't released as heat or sound needs to be transmitted to the foundation. Moreover, a large machine base is needed to absorb the impacts.|$|R
50|$|All Greek coins were handmade, {{rather than}} {{machined}} as modern coins are. The {{design for the}} obverse was carved (in incuso) into a block of bronze or possibly iron, called a die. The design of the reverse was carved into a similar punch. A blank disk of gold, silver, or electrum was cast in a mold and then, placed between these two and the punch struck hard with a <b>hammer,</b> <b>raising</b> the design {{on both sides of}} the coin.|$|R

The sculpture {{is an example}} of the socialist realistic style, as well as Art Deco style. The worker holds aloft a hammer and the kolkhoz woman a sickle to form the hammer and sickle symbol.|$|R
5000|$|After {{capturing}} a {{broadcasting station}} {{and using it}} to regroup the Red Faction, Sam and Alec lead the remaining Red Faction and Marauders on a final assault on EDF Central Command. The two groups converge on Mt. Vogel to assemble the machine, however a surprise EDF blitzkrieg led by General Roth wipes out the Marauders guarding the summit end of the accelerator and Vasha along with them. Alec storms the mountain with a modified missile-pod tank, defeating General Roth's army and killing Roth. Sam's plan succeeds and the accelerated Nano Forge is successful in vaporizing the Hydra. As the survivors of Mars celebrate, Sam declares the war over, but Alec responds that the EDF will return, stating [...] "We'll be ready for 'em". Alec and Sam approach the crowds of civilians gathered, and Alec <b>raises</b> his <b>hammer</b> in the air, showing {{the sign of the}} Red Faction and their long-waited victory.|$|R
5000|$|In Tolkien's works, the Dwarves (in {{the form}} of seven patriarchs) were created during the Years of the Trees (also known as the Ages of Darkness), when all of Middle-earth was {{controlled}} {{by the forces of}} Melkor. They were created by the Vala Aulë, in secret from the other Valar, intended to be his children to whom he could teach his crafts. Ilúvatar, however, knew of their creation, despite Aulë's efforts. When confronted by Ilúvatar, Aulë confessed his deed and <b>raised</b> his <b>hammer</b> to destroy his creations. However, Ilúvatar, seeing that they had been made not out of malice or wickedness, stayed Aulë's hand and sanctified the dwarves, though he did not allow them to [...] "awake" [...] before the Elves (whom he had designated as [...] "The Firstborn"). Aulë sealed the seven Fathers of the Dwarves in stone chambers in far-flung regions of Middle-earth to await their awakening.|$|R

On the left can be seen the eagle of Zeus holding a bundle of lightning bolts in his claws. Next to Rhea, three of the immortals fight with a mighty, bull-necked Giant. The first, a goddess, has not been identified; she is followed by Hephaistos, who <b>raises</b> a two-headed <b>hammer</b> aloft. He is followed by another unidentified, kneeling god who thrusts a spear into the body.|$|R
50|$|As {{the hour}} seemed dark for the Empire, Valten finally brought the Everchosen, Archaon, to single combat. In revenge for the steed {{he had lost}} to Chaos artillery, Valten first {{destroyed}} Archaon's daemonic mount, hurling the Chaos Warlord to the ground. <b>Raising</b> the <b>Hammer</b> of Sigmar high for the killing stroke, Archaon quickly unleashed the power within his daemon weapon, impaling Valten. Diverted but not stayed, Valten's blow still opened Archaon's armour and dashed him to the ground. As Valten tried to pull Archaon's blade free, Archaon regained his feet and dealt Valten another mortal blow, carving open his breastplate and sending him onto his back. Seemingly in shock at seeing the mark of Sigmar on Valten's chest, Archaon was charged by Luthor Huss, who landed a series of blows upon the Everchosen, including an almighty {{blow to the head}} that sent him down to one knee. Archaon overcame Huss, however, and hurled him across the battlefield.|$|R
5000|$|Media organizations, {{including}} Newsweek, MSNBC, Reuters, and the Associated Press, {{raised questions}} about and speculated on the similarity between a stance in one of Cho's videos which showed him holding and <b>raising</b> a <b>hammer,</b> and a pose from promotional posters for the South Korean movie Oldboy. Investigators {{found no evidence that}} Cho had ever watched Oldboy, and the professor who made the initial connection to Oldboy has since discounted his theory that Cho was influenced by the movie. The Virginia Tech Review Panel concluded that because of Cho's inability to handle stress and the [...] "frightening prospect" [...] of being [...] "turned out into the world of work, finances, responsibilities, and a family," [...] Cho chose to engage in a fantasy in which [...] "he would be remembered as the savior of the oppressed, the downtrodden, the poor, and the rejected." [...] The panel went further, stating that, [...] "His thought processes were so distorted that he began arguing to himself that his evil plan was actually doing good. His destructive fantasy was now becoming an obsession." ...|$|R
60|$|If Joan {{struggled}} at all, it {{was only}} slightly, when she writhed and slipped, like a snake, to get her arm under his as it clasped her neck. Then she let herself go. He crushed her to him. He bent her backward--tilted her face with hard and eager hand. Like a madman, with hot working lips, he kissed her. She felt blinded--scorched. But her purpose was as swift and sure and wonderful as his passion was wild. The first reach of her groping hand found his gun-belt. Swift as light her hand slipped down. Her fingers touched the cold gun--grasped with thrill on thrill--slipped farther down, strong and sure to <b>raise</b> the <b>hammer.</b> Then with a leaping, strung intensity that matched his own she drew the gun. She raised it while her eyes were shut. She lay passive under his kisses--the devouring kisses of one whose manhood had been denied the sweetness, the glory, the fire, the life of woman's lips. It was a moment in which she met his primitive fury of possession with a woman's primitive fury of profanation. She pressed the gun against his side and pulled the trigger.|$|R
50|$|Pape {{was born}} in Sarstedt, Germany, in 1789. He arrived in Paris in 1811 and secured {{employment}} with Pleyel, whose piano workshops he directed for several years. In 1815, he established his own manufacture of pianos, and almost annually for nearly forty years improved them with new inventions. His first grand pianos followed the English system of Broadwood and Tomkinson, though endowed with mechanical genius {{it was not long}} before he modified, then completely changed their principles of construction. Pape concentrated on defects in square and grand pianos caused by the structural gap between the sounding board and wrest plank allowing the hammers to strike the strings; the solution of placing actions above the strings had been imagined by Marius, then Hildebrand and finally Streicher in Vienna, but instead of levers and counterweights Pape's arrangement used a coil spring to <b>raise</b> the <b>hammers</b> quickly and with almost no effect on touch. This system was very successful in squares but lacked some lightness and delicacy in grand pianos. The variations he introduced in the forms and actions of upright pianos gave his instruments remarkable power.|$|R
