5|$|NY120 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, but only to the portion of its routing north of Westchester Avenue. It was extended south to <b>Rye</b> , then rerouted to follow Westchester Avenue east to Port Chester by the following year. Most of NY120's former routing to <b>Rye</b> became part of New York State Route119A at that time. NY120 was rerouted to serve <b>Rye</b> again in October1960, replacing NY119A.|$|E

5|$|Belarusian cuisine {{consists}} {{mainly of}} vegetables, meat (particularly pork), and bread. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed. Typically, Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest {{meal of the}} day. Wheat and <b>rye</b> breads are consumed in Belarus, but <b>rye</b> is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of bread and salt when greeting a guest or visitor.|$|E

5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the American diet. Starting with the Molasses Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This {{was more than a}} protest against taxation of molasses, the main ingredient in rum production. Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with <b>rye,</b> while the southern colonies preferred corn. <b>Rye</b> was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E
5|$|As {{far back}} as the Iron Age, Welsh folk were using wild cereals to create a coarse bread. By the time the Romans invaded, Celtic skills with bread had progressed to the point that white or brown breads could be produced. The Roman {{invasion}} led to many Welsh people moving to the less hospitable uplands, where the only cereal crops which could be grown were oats, barley and <b>rye.</b> Oat and barley breads were the main breads eaten in Wales up until the 19th century, with <b>rye</b> bread created for medicinal purposes. Oats were used to bulk out meat or meat and vegetable stews, also known as pottage.|$|E

5|$|NY120 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US1 (Boston Post Road) {{in the city}} of <b>Rye.</b> The route proceeds northward along Purchase Street as a two-lane street through the Locust Avenue Business District, intersecting a handful of local streets and serving Rye's station on the Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line. Past the station, the highway passes under the New Haven Line, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line, and I-95 in quick succession ahead of the Purchase Street Business District. The commercial surroundings give way to residential neighborhoods after three blocks as NY120 winds northward through the northern part of <b>Rye</b> to the adjacent village/town of Harrison.|$|E

5|$|NY120 was altered {{again by}} the {{following}} year to follow NY119 east along Westchester Avenue to US1 in Port Chester. Most of NY120's former routing south of Westchester Avenue became part of NY119A, a new route assigned to all of Purchase Street between NY119 and NY120 in Harrison and US1 in <b>Rye.</b> NY120 was realigned once more in October1960 to follow Purchase Street south to <b>Rye,</b> supplanting NY119A. At the same time, NY119 was truncated on its east end to Purchase Street while the portion of Westchester Avenue that had carried NY119 and NY120 between Purchase Street and Port Chester became an extension of NY120A.|$|E
5|$|NY120A {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY120 next to I-287 (the Cross-Westchester Expressway) {{in the village}} of Harrison. Although the route is signed north–south, it initially heads east along Westchester Avenue. East of the freeway overpass, NY120 leaves to the northwest while NY120A continues eastward on the four-lane Westchester Avenue. It serves residential areas until it crosses into <b>Rye</b> Brook, where the street makes a turn to the southeast and soon enters more commercialized neighborhoods. In the center of <b>Rye</b> Brook, the route meets Ridge Street (unsigned County Route54 or CR54). The businesses give way to homes east of the junction, and NY120A passes into the village of Port Chester just three blocks from Ridge Street near an intersection with Bowman Avenue (CR104).|$|E
5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and <b>rye,</b> and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and <b>rye.</b>|$|E
