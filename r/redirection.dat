5|$|If magma were to rise {{towards the}} surface of Nazko, new {{earthquake}} swarms would occur, with {{a significant increase in}} the size and number of earthquakes. An eruption in the Nazko area would probably create a small cinder cone, similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. Immediate hazards related to cinder cone eruptions in the Nazko area would probably be forest fires and, if an eruption column were produced, <b>redirection</b> of nearby air traffic.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd century saw the Danube river {{become the}} {{principal}} artery of trade, eclipsing the Amber Road and other commercial routes. The <b>redirection</b> of investment to the Danubian forts saw the towns along the Amber Road growing slowly, though yet retaining their prosperity.

5|$|Trusts {{where the}} {{doctrine}} is applicable {{are divided into}} two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the <b>redirection</b> of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, {{since there is no}} question of allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds should be subject to cy-près or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined on the facts of each individual case.|$|E

5|$|When {{the first}} section of the Jubilee line was planned in the 1970s, {{the second phase of the}} project was {{intended}} to continue the line eastwards from the terminus at Charing Cross to the City of London, Woolwich and Thamesmead. Westminster station would not have been on this planned route, but the need to provide transport infrastructure for the redevelopment of the London Docklands in east and south-east London led to a <b>redirection</b> of the route to run via Westminster to connect Waterloo and London Bridge stations with the new developments. For the Jubilee Line Extension, the buildings around the station were demolished and the sub-surface station was completely reconstructed together with the erection of a parliamentary office building, Portcullis House, which sits above the station. Both projects were designed by Michael Hopkins & Partners.|$|E
5|$|The U.K. {{government}} attempted several {{measures to}} revive the London foreign exchange market, the most notable of which were implemented on September 5 to extend the previous moratorium through October and allow the Bank of England to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon {{the end of the}} war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid acceptances for currency transactions. By mid-October, the London market began functioning properly as a result of the September measures. The war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the foreign exchange market, such as the London Stock Exchange's prolonged closure, the <b>redirection</b> of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military armaments, and myriad disruptions of freight and mail. The pound sterling enjoyed general stability throughout World War I, in large part due to various steps taken by the U.K. government to influence the pound's value in ways that yet provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies. Such measures included open market interventions on foreign exchange, borrowing in foreign currencies rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities, outbound capital controls, and limited import restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The game retains Portals {{gameplay}} elements, {{and adds}} new features, including tractor beams, laser <b>redirection,</b> bridges made of light, and paint-like 'gels' accelerating the player's speed, allowing the player-character to jump higher or place portals on any surface. In the single-player campaign, the player controls protagonist Chell, awoken from suspended animation after many years, who must navigate the now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the reactivated GLaDOS, a powerful supercomputer. The storyline introduces new characters, including Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). Ellen McLain reprised {{the role of}} GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The National each produced a song for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player cooperative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body (both voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) are each given a portal gun and are required {{to work together to}} solve puzzles. Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an auto-tuning scheme, {{based on a}} fuzzy logic controller (FLC), for a standardized inter-system cell reselection (IS-CR) algorithm in a multi-radio access technology network. FLC modifies IS-CR parameters {{to reduce the number}} of call <b>redirections</b> between technologies during the admission control stage based on network performance indicators. Experience shows that call establishment delay is thus greatly reduced. To validate the proposed scheme, a dynamic system-level simulator comprising GSM and UMTS radio access technologies has been developed. This simulator includes a joint radio resource management (JRRM) entity, whose parameters are tuned by the FLC. FLC tuning capabilities are checked out in an extreme, albeit realistic, scenario, where most traffic is unevenly distributed in space and technologies. Results show that call <b>redirections</b> in the admission control stage can be significantly reduced, while keeping connection quality almost unaltered at the expense of increasing changes between technologies during the cell reselection process.
