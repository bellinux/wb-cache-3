40|$|Increasing herd size often brings major {{challenges}} in maintaining dense swards, especially near cow houses. High-quality, trampling-resistant swards are crucial for grazing management, animal welfare and environmental protection. A field experiment initiated in July 2012 (triplicate plots) at Uppsala, Sweden, is comparing four seed mixtures {{with regard to}} establishment rate, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>trampling</b> and grazing behaviour. The mixtures comprise forage and amenity cultivars of smooth meadow-grass (Poa pratensis) and red fescue (Festuca rubra), with/without inclusions of white clover (Trifolium repens), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea). Degree of ground cover was evaluated by spatial analysis of Unmanned Aircraft System photographs (taken May, July, Sept. 2013, April 2014) and field measurements (plants m- 2) (August 2012, May 2013). Botanical composition was determined in May 2014. The seed mixture with tall fescue (35 % cv. Borneo) established significantly more slowly than other mixtures (P< 0. 05), but by September 2013 had the highest ground cover (70 %) due to {{a high proportion of}} white clover. In May 2014, all four mixtures had sufficient ground cover after winter (~ 86 %). Next, the treatments will be intensively grazed and trampling resistance and grazing behaviour analysed...|$|E
40|$|Tourist traffic {{has been}} {{observed}} to cause changes in vegetation cover, particularly in alpine areas. These changes can be monitored using remote-sensing methods. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} condition of the dominant sward species surrounding the most frequented alpine tourist trails in the Tatra National Park, one of the most visited natural mountain parks in Poland and a UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Reserve. Hyperspectral measurements of interactions between the electromagnetic spectrum and the morphology and physiology of plants were presented. The spectral properties of plants and remote-sensing vegetation indices could be used at a later date for monitoring, for example from the air. The results identified the species' sensitivity and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>trampling</b> and allowed an assessment of their physiological condition. Differences were observed in the conditions of trampled and control plants. The alpine swards in the Tatra National Park were assessed as being in good condition, with only small areas located close to the most popular trails showing damage. The proposed method for analyzing the condition of alpine swards could be a useful tool for the future management of protected areas...|$|E
40|$|Australian flora are {{particularly}} vulnerable to anthropogenic change due {{to high levels of}} diversity and endemism with many species in Western Australia exhibiting small ranges with low numbers and restricted populations. Perhaps considered the least significant of a range of threatening process this work shows that recreational damage via trampling has the capacity to degrade a highly valued tourism resource. We provide data on the impacts of trampling within an international biodiversity hotspot. Using established methodologies we demonstrate that low levels of trampling cause significant damage and that the shrub-dominated communities of three National Parks have a low <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> human <b>trampling</b> disturbance. Measurements taken at selected intervals over a 12 -month period additionally indicate that the vegetation community has a low resilience <b>to</b> human <b>trampling.</b> Further work that can be undertaken in the future includes collecting recovery data following experimental trampling over a longer time frame (e. g. 5 years) and gauging the responses of individual species <b>to</b> <b>trampling</b> damage. Selected sites could also be monitored for the effectiveness of educational strategies and infrastructure placement...|$|R
40|$|Vegetation {{trampling}} {{resulting from}} recreation can adversely impact natural habitats, {{leading to the}} loss of vegetation and the degradation of plant communities. A considerable primary literature exists on this topic, therefore it is important to assess whether this accumulated evidence can be used to reach general conclusions concerning vegetation vulnerability to inform conservation management decisions. Experimental trampling studies on a global scale were retrieved using a systematic review methodology and synthesised using random effects meta-analysis. The relationships between vegetation recovery and each of initial vegetation resistance, trampling intensity, time for recovery, Raunkiaer life-form (perennating bud position), and habitat were tested using random effects multiple meta-regressions and subgroup analyses. The systematic search yielded 304 studies; of these, nine reported relevant randomized controlled experiments, providing 188 vegetation recovery effect sizes for analysis. The synthesis indicated there was significant heterogeneity in the impact of trampling on vegetation recovery. This was related <b>to</b> <b>resistance</b> and recovery time, and the interactions of these variables with Raunkiaer life-form, but was not strongly dependent on the intensity of the trampling experienced. The available evidence suggests that vegetation dominated by hemicryptophytes and geophytes recovers from <b>trampling</b> <b>to</b> a greater extent than vegetation dominated by other life-forms. Variation in effect within the chamaephyte, hemicryptophyte and geophyte life-form sub-groups was also explained by the initial <b>resistance</b> of vegetation <b>to</b> <b>trampling,</b> but not by trampling intensity. Intrinsic properties of plant communities appear {{to be the most important}} factors determining the response of vegetation <b>to</b> <b>trampling</b> disturbance. Specifically, the dominant Raunkiaer life-form of a plant community accounts for more variation in the resilience of communities <b>to</b> <b>trampling</b> than the intensity of the trampling experienced, suggesting that simple assessments based on this trait could guide decisions concerning sustainable access to natural areas. Methodological and reporting limitations must be overcome before more disparate types of evidence can be synthesised; this would enable more reliable extrapolation to non-study situations, and a more comprehensive understanding of how assessments of intrinsic plant traits can be used to underpin conservation management decisions concerning access...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} diploma thesis was {{to analyse}} {{the effect of a}} seeding on a quality of fodder as well as the {{participation}} of added varieties of the clover meadow and other hybrids. Sowing machines with different intensity of the original turf were chosen {{to be added to the}} seeding. These sowing machines were: GP TP [...] 300, SE 2 - 024 and PP [...] 2. The crop yield of dry basis, the content of NL, a fibre and NEL were evalueted. The values were specified with the aid of the method of Spektroscopie in the near infra-red area (NIR Systems 6500). Participation of added species was evalueted by the method of projective dominance. The added varieties of species didn't proved convincing difference in the content of NL of growth, but the content of NL was different with regard to the sequence of mowings (P< 0, 05). The seeding of the clover meadow had a positive influence on the content of NEL in the growth (P< 0, 05). It is recommended to add a variety of Felina to a pasture for horses because it is convenient as a seeding to pastures and it has many advantages like a <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> a <b>trampling</b> or a good hibernation. It provides also good crop yield and thanks to its structure and its content of nutriments it is fitting to feed horses...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{trampling}} trials using {{a standardized}} methodology were undertaken in ten replicate blocks in three vegetation types {{in an urban}} reserve in the subtropics of Australia. In each block different intensities of trampling (controls, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400 and 500 passes) were applied, and vegetation parameters were measured pre trampling, immediately after trampling and two weeks later. A fern understorey had low <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>trampling</b> intensity, with reductions in relative vegetation height and cover with as few as 10 passes. A tussock grass understorey showed moderate resistance with reduction in height at 25 passes and cover at 50 passes. A disturbed grassland dominated by lawn grasses had the highest resistance, with reductions in vegetation height at 100 passes, but cover was affected by as few as 10 passes. The resistance indices (number of passes required to reduce vegetation cover by 50 %) of three vegetation types were 210, 360 and 860 passes respectively. When these values were compared with those for 52 other vegetation types considerable variation was found within life forms, climatic zones and vegetation types indicating that the response of a specific community {{may not always be}} predictable.

40|$|The goal of {{the paper}} is a {{presentation}} of field remote sensing methods for the analysis of the trampled plants of a highly protected mountain meadow ecosystem (M&B UNESCO Reserve {{and one of the most}} important Polish National Parks). The research area covers a core part of the Western Tatras - the GÄ…sienicowa Valley and Kasprowy Wierch summit, which are among the most visited destinations of the Polish Tatras. The research method is based on field hyperspectral measurements, using the ASD FieldSpec 3 spectrometer, on the dominant plant species of alpine swards. Sampling sites were located on trampled areas (next to trails) and reference plots, with the same species, but located more than 10 m from the trail (where the probability of trampling was very low, but the same composition of analysed plants). In each case, homogenous plots with a domination of one plant species were investigated. Based on the hyperspectral measurements, spectral characteristics as well as vegetation indices were analysed with the ANOVA statistical test. This indicated a varied <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>trampling</b> of the studied plant species. The analysis of vegetation indices enabled the selection of those groups which are the most useful for research into mountain vegetation condition: the broadband greenness group; the narrowband greenness group, measuring chlorophyll content and cell structure; and the canopy water content group. The results of the analyses show that vegetation of the High Tatras is characterised by optimal ranges of remote sensing indices. Only plants located nearest to the trails were in a worse condition (chlorophyll and water content was lower for the reference targets). These differences are statistically significant, but the measured values indicate a good condition of vegetation along trampled trails, within the range of optimum plant characteristics...|$|E
30|$|We cannot {{assume that}} the {{ecosystem}} in this study will have any specific responses <b>to</b> <b>trampling</b> since previous studies show rather arbitrary or complex effects from trampling on vascular plants and there are few studies on bryophytes and lichen. However, since alpine heath ecosystem might be vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>trampling</b> in general, but in particular {{those who have a}} high proportion of bryophytes and lichens that are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>trampling,</b> it would seem likely to assume that proximity to trail could induce decreases of the vegetative cover, species richness and diversity of the canopy and understory.|$|R

40|$|In {{semiarid}} drylands {{water shortage}} and trampling by large herbivores are two factors limiting plant growth and distribution. Trampling can strongly affect plant performance, but {{little is known}} about responses of morphological and mechanical traits of woody plants <b>to</b> <b>trampling</b> and their possible interaction with water availability. Seedlings of four shrubs (Caragana intermedia, Cynanchum komarovi, Hedysarum laeve and Hippophae rhamnoides) common in the semiarid Mu Us Sandland were grown at 4 % and 10 % soil water content and exposed <b>to</b> either simulated <b>trampling</b> or not. Growth, morphological and mechanical traits were measured. Trampling decreased vertical height and increased basal diameter and stem <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> bending and rupture (as indicated by the increased minimum bend and break force) in all species. Increasing water availability increased biomass, stem length, basal diameter, leaf thickness and rigidity of stems in all species except C. komarovii. However, there were no interactive effects of trampling and water content on any of these traits among species except for minimum bend force and the ratio between stem <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> rupture and bending. Overall shrub species have a high degree of trampling resistance by morphological and mechanical modifications, and the effects of trampling do not depend on water availability. However, the increasing water availability can also affect trade-off between stem strength and flexibility caused by trampling, which differs among species.
