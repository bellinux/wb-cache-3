40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the timing of an {{investment}} to reduce the emissions of a stock pollutant under environmental uncertainty depends on the specification of uncertainty, on its level, and {{on the presence of}} a lower <b>reflecting</b> <b>barrier</b> for the level of pollutant. When variability increases with the level of stock pollutant and uncertainty is high enough, emissions should be curbed immediately; when uncertainty is small, however, there is no simple irreversibility effect because of the tension between environmental and investment irreversibility. Finally, a lower <b>reflecting</b> <b>barrier</b> may significantly affect the action threshold. These results have implications for global warming...|$|E

40|$|A {{system manager}} {{dynamically}} controls a diffusion process Z {{that lives in}} a finite interval [0,b]. Control {{takes the form of}} a negative drift rate θ that is chosen from a fixed set A of available values. The controlled process evolves according to the differential relationship dZ = dX − θ(Z) dt + dL − dU, where X is a (0,σ) Brownian motion, and L and U are increasing processes that enforce a lower <b>reflecting</b> <b>barrier</b> at Z = 0 and an upper <b>reflecting</b> <b>barrier</b> at Z = b, respectively.

The objective is to minimize long-run average cost. This problem is solved explicitly, which allows one to also solve the following, essentially equivalent formulation: minimize the long-run average cost of control subject to an upper bound constraint on the average rate at which U increases.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a situation in}} which a decision maker chooses between the safe action and the uncertain action infinitely many times. The decision maker knows the payoff for the safe action, but does not know the payoff for the uncertain action which is determined by an unknown probability function. The decision may be influenced by the payoff-irrelevant context in which the current decision problem is to be considered. The context fluctuates according to another unknown probability function. The decision maker is modeled by a Markov learning rule with reflecting barriers which determines a state of mind in every period on the basis of past experiences. We argue that the context-dependence of decision making {{plays an important role in}} finding out the efficient action in the long run, because it causes the decision maker to gather unbiased information at any time. We show that there exists a learning rule according to which the decision maker succeeds to choose the efficient action in the long run irrespective of how payoff-uncertainty and context-uncertainty are specified. We also characterize the class of such efficient learning rules, and argue that it is necessary that the upper <b>reflecting</b> <b>barrier,</b> regarded as the maximal strength of confidence that the uncertain action is more profitable than the safe action, greatly surpasses the negative of the lower <b>reflecting</b> <b>barrier</b> regarded as the minimal strength of confidence. ...|$|E
