50|$|The <b>Roman</b> <b>goose</b> is an Italian {{breed of}} {{domestic}} goose. It {{is said to}} be one of the oldest breeds of goose, bred more than 2000 years ago and originally sacred to the Goddess Juno. In the modern period, it is kept for a range of purposes depending on location. It is a popular exhibition breed in North America, where it is more commonly known as the tufted <b>Roman</b> <b>goose</b> and possesses a crest. In Europe, it is primarily kept as a utility meat breed, while in Australia, they are used for both purposes. Crests are optional in Europe and Australia.|$|E
50|$|Some sources {{list the}} African goose, <b>Roman</b> <b>goose</b> (Tufted Roman), Pomeranian goose (Saddleback Pomeranian), and Chinese goose {{as the best}} breeds for guard duty. The African and Chinese {{are said to be}} loud, and the African both loud and large.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the villus distribution in the caeca of domestic geese based on the fine structure. The caeca of White <b>Roman</b> <b>geese,</b> 14 -week old, were sampled and specimens were detected under photomicroscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results indicated that the villi existed at the proximal caecum. The morphologies of these villi showed finger-like, peak-like or tongue-like shapes. The heights of the villi decreased far from the proximal caecum. No villi were found in the middle and distal caecum. It was obvious that the proximal segment was the main portion for absorbing food nutrients in the caeca. The caecal content particles were small and possessed a viscid character. The large particles filtered out at the proximal caecum just like a mesh. The surface of the middle caecum exhibited parallel ridges with no villi. There were band plicae circular shapes found in the middle caecum under scanning electron microsopy...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{interference}} from nuclear copies of mitochondrial DNA (numts), mtDNA of the white <b>Roman</b> <b>goose</b> (domestic goose) was extracted from liver mitochondria. The mtDNA control region was amplified using a long PCR strategy and then sequenced. Neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum-likelihood approaches were implemented using the 1, 177 bp mtDNA control region sequences to compute the phylogenetic relationships of the domestic goose with other geese. The resulting identity values for the white Roman geese were 99. 1 % (1, 166 / 1, 177) with western graylag geese and 98. 8 % (1, 163 / 1, 177) with eastern graylag geese. In molecular phylogenetic trees, the white <b>Roman</b> <b>goose</b> was grouped in the graylag lineage, indicating that the white <b>Roman</b> <b>goose</b> came from the graylag goose (Anser anser). Thus, the scientific name of the white <b>Roman</b> <b>goose</b> should be Anser anser 'White Roman. '...|$|E
25|$|Changes to the plumage are variable; {{many have}} been {{selected}} to lose dark brown tones of the wild bird. The result is an animal marked, or completely covered in white feathers. Others retain plumage close to the natural; some, such as the modern Toulouse goose look almost identical to the greylag in plumage, differing only in structure. White geese are often preferred as they look better plucked and dressed, with any small down feathers remaining being less conspicuous. From {{the time of the}} <b>Romans,</b> white <b>geese</b> have been held in great esteem.|$|R
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the <b>Roman</b> empire, <b>goose</b> liver {{temporarily}} vanished from European cuisine. Some claim that Gallic farmers preserved the foie gras tradition until the rest of Europe rediscovered it centuries later, but the medieval French peasant's food animals were mainly pig and sheep. Others claim that the tradition was preserved by the Jews, who learned the method of enlarging a goose's liver during the Roman colonisation of Judea or earlier from Egyptians. The Jews carried this culinary knowledge as they migrated farther north and west to Europe.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} stocking density and genetic lines, {{factors that may}} alter the severity and incidence of angel wing (AW), in White <b>Roman</b> <b>geese.</b> Geese (n = 384) from two genetically selected lines (normal- winged line, NL, and angel-winged line, AL, respectively) and one commercial line (CL) were raised in four pens. Following common commercial practice, low-stocking-density (LD), medium-stocking-density, and high-stocking-density treatments were respectively administered to 24, 32, and 40 geese per pen at 0 to 3 weeks (1. 92 m 2 /pen) and 4 to 6 weeks (13. 2 m 2 /pen) of age and to 24, 30, and 36 geese at 7 to 14 weeks (20. 0 m 2 /pen) of age. The results revealed that stocking density mainly affected body weight gain in geese younger than 4 weeks, and that geese subjected to LD had a high body weight at 2 weeks of age. However, the effect of stocking density on the severity score of AW (SSAW) and incidence of AW (IAW) {{did not differ significantly}} among the treatments. Differences were observed among the genetic stocks; that is, SSAW and IAW were significantly higher in AL than in NL and CL. Genetic selection generally aggravates AW, complicating its elimination. To effectively reduce IAW, stocking density, a suspected causal factor, should be lower than that presently applied commercially...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the conversion rate of formic and acetic acids into methane in the gastrointestinal tracts of geese. In experiment 1, two sets of two 4 -month-old male White <b>Roman</b> <b>geese</b> were allocated {{to one of two}} treatment groups. Each set of geese was inoculated either with formic acid or with phosphate buffer solution (PBS). After the acid or the PBS was inoculated into the esophagi of the geese, two birds from each treatment were placed in a respiratory chamber as a measurement unit for 4 h in order to determine methane production rate. In experiment II and III, 6 - and 7 -wk-old male White Roman goslings were used, respectively. Birds were allocated to receive either formic acid or PBS solution injected into the ceca in experiment II. Acetic acid or PBS solution injected into the cecum were used for experiment III. After either the acids or the PBS solution were injected into the cecum, two birds from each treatment were placed in a respiratory chamber as a measurement unit for 3 h; each treatment was repeated 3 times. The results indicated that formic acid inoculated into the oesophagi of geese was quickly converted into methane. Compared with the PBS-injected group, methane production increased by 5. 02 times in the formic acid injected group (4. 32 vs. 0. 86 mg/kg BW/d; p< 0. 05). Acetic acid injected into the ceca did not increase methane production; conversely, it tended to decrease methane production. The present study suggests that formic acid may be converted to methane in the ceca, and that acetic acid may not be a precursor of methane in the ceca of geese...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of spent mushroom compost (SMC) meal on the growth performance and meat characteristics of geese. The SMC extracts contained 2. 49 ± 0. 62 mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry weight (DW) and 1. 08 ± 0. 15 mg quercetin equivalent/g DW of the total phenolic and flavonoid contents. A total of 120 White <b>Roman</b> <b>geese,</b> aged five weeks, were randomly distributed among 12 pens and fed a grower diet ad libitum during the growing period, with each pen containing five males and five females in a completely randomized design. Each treatment comprised three pens (total of 30 geese), including control (corn-soybean meal); supplementation with 5 % SMC meal (5 % SMC); supplementation with 10 % SMC (10 % SMC); and supplementation with 15 % SMC (15 % SMC), for eight weeks. The results revealed that the body weight of the 15 % SMC group was significantly lower than that of the control group at the age of 12 weeks. There were no significant effects among the groups on feed conversion ratio or intake. The malondialdehyde content of the serum in the 15 % SMC group was lower than that of the control group at week 12. There were no significant effects among the groups for blood biochemical parameters in grower geese at week 12. The color values of meats in the SMC groups were higher than those obtained with control group. The flavor and acceptability score of meats in the 5 % SMC group were significantly higher than for the 15 % SMC and control group. Supplementation with SMC at 5 % in the diet has no adverse effects on the growth performance of grower geese. However, SMC meal at 5 % in the diet favorably affects sensory attributes (meat flavor and acceptability) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment {{was to investigate the}} development of gastrointestinal tract and activities of pancreatic enzymes in White <b>Roman</b> <b>geese.</b> Thirty developing embryos at the 22 th, 24 th and 26 th day of incubation and at hatching, and sixteen or eight goslings, half males and half females, at the 1, 3, 7 or 11, 14, 21 and 28 days of age were sampled, respectively. The weights of the yolk, gastrointestinal tract and intestinal length, and the activities of pancreatic enzymes were measured. Residual yolk weight decreased rapidly during late-incubation and was nearly depleted,at 3 days of age. The protein and energy contents in the residual yolk of goslings at 3 days of age were significantly (p < 0. 05) less than those at the late incubation. From 6 days before hatching to 28 days of age, the absolute weights of gizzard, proventriculus, liver, pancreas, small intestine and large intestine in goslings increased by 48, 457, 94, 2334, 89 and 76 times, respectively. The relative weights of proventriculus, gizzard, liver, pancreas, small intestine and large intestine reached peaks at 3, 3, 14, 14, 11 and 11 days of age, respectively, and then decreased gradually. However, the relative lengths of small intestine and large intestine reached peaks at 3 days of age and at hatching, respectively. The activities of pancreatic trypsin and chymotrypsin increased sharply from hatching to 14 day of age, and then decreased gradually until 21 days of age. The activity and specific activity of pancreatic amylase were increased following by age and peaked at 7 to 11 and 21 days of age, respectively. The activity and specific activity of pancreatic lipase reached a plateau from 11 to 28 days of age. These results indicate that the gastrointestinal tract and activities of pancreatic enzymes developed more rapidly than body weight through the early growing period of goslings...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of photoperiods longer than 14 h of light: 10 h of dark (14 L: 10 D) during the rearing period on the age at first egg laying (AFE) and the subsequent reproductive performance in <b>geese.</b> Sixty-six White <b>Roman</b> <b>geese</b> (18 male and 48 female) were divided into three groups and subjected to different lighting schemes, i. e. natural lighting (NAT; 23 degrees 51 'N, 120 degrees 33 'E), 14 L and 18 L. Birds in 14 L and 18 L groups were exposed to 14 L: 10 D or 18 L: 6 D, respectively, beginning at 19 weeks of age and followed by a photoperiod of 10 L: 14 D from 40 weeks of age. The natural photoperiod, including both dawn and dusk was between 11. 5 L: 12. 5 D and 14. 5 L: 9. 5 D. The results showed that the AFE was postponed (P < 0. 05). Average weight of the first three eggs laid and the fertility of these eggs were improved (P < 0. 05) for the geese in 14 L and 18 L groups when compared to those raised under natural lighting conditions. Meanwhile, the duration of laying were shifted from spring to autumn, with the peak laying rate in September and November instead of March. It was concluded that geese exposed to the photoperiod longer than 14 L: I OD for 21 weeks during the rearing period would suppress their AFE. Thereafter, the onset of laying could be induced by being transferred to the photoperiod of 10 L: 14 D. The manipulation of photoperiodic regimes used in this study might have a potential benefit for geese farmers through improved weight and fertility of eggs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

6000|$|Dante, {{besides his}} great poem, {{and a few}} Latin eclogues of no great value, wrote lyrics full of Platonical sentiment, some of which {{anticipated}} the loveliest of Petrarch's; {{and he was the}} author of various prose works, political and philosophical, all more or less masterly for the time in which he lived, and all coadjutors of his poetry in fixing his native tongue. His account of his Early Life (the Vita Nuova) is a most engaging history of a boyish passion, evidently as real and true on his own side as love and truth can be, whatever might be its mistake as to its object. The treatise on the Vernacular Tongue (de Vulgari Eloquio) shews how critically he considered his materials for impressing the world, and what a reader he was of every production of his contemporaries. The Banquet (Convito) is but an abstruse commentary on some of his minor poems; but the book on Monarchy (de Monarchia) is a compound of ability and absurdity, in which his great genius is fairly overborne by the barbarous pedantry of the age. It is an argument to prove that the world must all be governed by one man; that this one man must be the successor of the Roman Emperor--God having manifestly designed the world to be subject for ever to the Roman empire; and lastly, that this Emperor is equally designed by God to be independent of the Pope--spiritually subject to him, indeed, but so far only as a good son is subject to the religious advice of his father; and thus making Church and State happy for ever in the two divided supremacies. And all this assumption of the obsolete and impossible the author gravely proves in all the forms of logic, by arguments drawn from the history of Æneas, and the providential cackle of the <b>Roman</b> <b>geese!</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Geese {{are one of}} {{the most}} ancient poultry species, domesticated about 3000 – 2500 B. C. There are {{currently}} several different goose production techniques, some of them known from time immemorial: 1) force-feeding for fat liver (Egypt, 2686 – 2181 B. C.); 2) selection for extremely large body size, exceeding that of modern Toulouse geese (Egypt, 600 B. C. – 200 A. D.); and 3) feather plucking, introduced by ancient Egyptians and <b>Romans.</b> Commercial <b>goose</b> breeding today is dispersed as almost cosmopolitan. The majority of world goose flocks are concentrated in Asia, predominantly in China. In Europe, especially eastern Europe, we observe plentiful goose breed diversity (Fig. 1). The main goose products are raw and processed foodstuffs (meat, fat liver, and goose fat) and down and feathers for stuffing [...] . Conclusion. Further progress in goose production will depend on new tendencies in world market development and diversification, and will rely on advances in selection and management utilizing goose biological and economic features. Integration of genetic, nutritional, reproductive and management approaches — all of which are necessary for more complete utilization of goose genetic potential and adjustment to specific production systems — will aid sustainable production of a variety of healthy and high-quality goose products...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of monochromic light-emitting diode (LED) light with different color on the growth and reproductive performances of white <b>Roman</b> breeder <b>geese.</b> A randomized complete batch design was utilized for the trial, and the replicate was regarded as one batch. Twenty ganders and fifty-five dames were used in batch 1 (started on 2011 / 6 / 17 and ended on 2012 / 1 / 31), thirty ganders and eighty-four dames were used in batch 2 (started on 2012 / 3 / 23 and ended on 2012 / 10 / 26), and thirty ganders and seventy-two dames were used in batch 3 (started on 2013 / 3 / 12 and ended on 2013 / 12 / 20). Two hundred and ninety-one geese were randomly assigned to 6 rooms in an environmentally controlled house. They were randomly allotted into one of three monochromatic light treatments: Blue, red, or white. The results showed that there was no significant difference in body weight among the three lighting groups at any point throughout the experimental period. However, compared to the blue light group, significantly more eggs were produced by the red and white light groups (p< 0. 05). Furthermore, the laying period of the red light group was significantly longer than that of other two groups (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, our results suggested that red LED-light has the best effect on reproductive performance (i. e. longer laying period and higher total eggs number) at 30 lux light intensity, and is therefore a better choice for the management of breeding geese than blue or white LED-light...|$|R
