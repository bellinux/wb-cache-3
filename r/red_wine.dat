5|$|Conclusions on dietary {{components}} have {{at times}} {{been difficult to}} ascertain as results have differed between population-based studies and randomised controlled trials. There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> is associated with lower risk of AD. There is tentative evidence that caffeine may be protective. A number of foods high in flavonoids such as cocoa, <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> and tea may decrease the risk of AD.|$|E

40|$|In the {{experiment}} {{the influence of}} different storage conditions of annual bottle aging on changes {{in the composition of}} phenolic compounds in white and <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> was observed. Total phenolics, flavanols, anthocyanins and antiradical activity were observed. A higher content of phenolics and a higher antiradical activity were detected in <b>red</b> <b>wines.</b> Higher temperature induces a higher content of phenolics in white <b>wines.</b> In <b>red</b> <b>wines,</b> higher temperature induces a lower content of total phenols. The content of flavanols in white and <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> decreases more at a higher temperature. The decrease of anthocyanins was observed in all <b>red</b> <b>wines.</b> Antiradical activity has increased in white wines with a cork stopper. In <b>red</b> <b>wines,</b> antiradical activity has decreased. The best storage conditions are low temperature and darkness. Classic cork stopper is the best closure for <b>red</b> <b>wines.</b> White wines closed by a screw cap were sensory evaluated more positively, cork stopper induces a higher antiradical activity...|$|R
25|$|When {{the first}} wine labeled as a rosé was {{produced}} {{is not known}} {{but it is very}} likely that many of the earliest <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> made were closer in appearance to today's rosés than they would be to modern <b>red</b> <b>wines.</b> This is because many of the winemaking techniques used to make today's darker, more tannic <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> (such as extended maceration and harder pressing) were not widely practiced in ancient winemaking. Both <b>red</b> and white <b>wine</b> grapes were often pressed soon after harvest, with very little maceration time, by hand, feet or even sack cloth creating juice that was only lightly pigmented.|$|R

5|$|The {{taste of}} the <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> depends on the {{ripeness}} of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone.|$|E
5|$|In 1254 or 1255, Henry III {{received}} an African elephant from Louis IX of France depicted by Matthew Paris in his ‘Chronica Majora’. A wooden structure {{was built to}} house the elephant, 12.2m (40ft) long by 6.1m (20ft) wide. The animal died in 1258, possibly because it was given <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> but also {{perhaps because of the}} cold climate of England.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the grape}} was {{fermented}} and shipped north to Tuscany and Piedmont, {{where it was}} used as a blending grape to enhance the body of thin red wines produced in those areas. When the link between Primitivo and Zinfandel began to emerge, plantings in the region and production of non-blended varietal increased. Today most Italian Primitivo is made as a rustic, highly alcoholic <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> with up to 16% alcohol by volume (ABV). Some Italian winemakers age the wines in new American oak to imitate American-style Zinfandel.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century German horticulturalists devoted many {{efforts to develop}} new Riesling hybrids that would create a more flexible, less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant {{characteristics}} of Riesling. The most notable is the Müller-Thurgau developed in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1882, which is a cross of Riesling and Madeleine Royale (although long believed to be Riesling x Silvaner). Other Riesling/Silvaner crosses include the Palatinate regional favorite Scheurebe and Rieslaner. Kerner, a cross between Riesling and the <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> grape Trollinger is a high quality cross that has recently eclipsed Riesling in plantings.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of <b>red</b> <b>wine),</b> the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E
5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E

40|$|The {{relevance}} of H. pylori to {{the pathogenesis of}} gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcers has been proposed for about the past 25 years; {{the presence of this}} bacterium is now established as the main risk factor in the development of stomach carcinomas and lymphomas.

5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (<b>red)</b> <b>wine</b> with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E
5|$|The apéritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E

5|$|The still wines of {{the area}} were highly prized in Paris under the {{designation}} of vins de la rivière and vins de la montagne- wines {{of the river and}} wines of the mountain in reference to the wooded terrain and the river Marne which carried the wines down to the Seine and into Paris. The region was in competition with Burgundy for the Flemish wine trade and tried to capitalize on Reims' location along the trade route from Beaune. In the 15th century, Pinot noir became heavily planted in the area. The resulting <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> had difficulty comparing well to the richness and coloring of Burgundy wines, despite the addition of elderberries to deepen the color. This led to a greater focus on white wines.|$|E
5|$|The war {{of words}} would {{continue}} for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were {{on the brink of}} civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the health benefits of the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E
5|$|Wine was {{commonly}} {{drunk and}} was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice. According to Galen's dietetics it was considered hot and dry but these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down. Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine in moderation (especially <b>red</b> <b>wine)</b> was, among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good blood and brighten the mood. The quality of wine differed considerably according to vintage, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape pressings. The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes. The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content. Common folk usually {{had to settle for}} a cheap white or rosé from a second or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication. For the poorest (or the most pious), watered-down vinegar (similar to Ancient Roman posca) would often be the only available choice.|$|E
