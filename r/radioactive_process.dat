500|$|A quark of one flavor can {{transform}} into a quark of another flavor {{only through the}} weak interaction, {{one of the four}} fundamental interactions in particle physics. By absorbing or emitting a W boson, any up-type quark (up, charm, and top quarks) can change into any down-type quark (down, strange, and bottom quarks) and vice versa. This flavor transformation mechanism causes the <b>radioactive</b> <b>process</b> of beta decay, in which a neutron (...)

5000|$|Pondcrete is {{a mixture}} of cement and sludge. [...] Its role is to {{immobilize}} hazardous waste and, in some cases, lower-level radioactive waste, in the form of solid material. [...] The material was used by the United States Department of Energy and its contractor, Rockwell International, in an attempt to handle the radioactive waste from contaminated ponds in the Rocky Flats Plant for burial in Nevada desert.Portland cement is mixed with sludge to solidify into “pondcrete” blocks and placed into large, plastic lined boxes. [...] The sludge is taken from solar evaporation ponds which are used to remove moisture from waste materials, therefore reducing their weight. To do this, liquid waste is poured into artificial, shallow ponds. The waste is heated by solar radiation and any moisture is evaporated, leaving behind the waste. These ponds contained low level <b>radioactive</b> <b>process</b> waste as well as sanitary sewage sludge and wastes, which categorize them and the Pondcrete as a mixed waste.|$|E

50|$|Monazite is a rare-earth-element {{phosphate}} mineral, (Ce, La, Nd, Th, Y)PO4. It {{appears in}} a small amount as an accessory mineral in many igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.

50|$|The {{theory is}} that {{monazite}} has high contents of Th (generally 3-15% and up to 25% of its weight) and U (generally hundreds of ppm and up to 5% in concentration).

40|$|International audienceSpent ion {{exchange}} resins (IERs) are <b>radioactive</b> <b>process</b> wastes {{for which there is}} no satisfactory industrial treatment. Supercritical water oxidation offers a viable treatment alternative to destroy the organic structure of resins, used to remove radioactivity. Up to now, studies carried out in supercritical water for IER destruction showed that degradation rates higher than 99 % are difficult to obtain even using a catalyst or a large oxidant excess. In this study, a co-fuel, isopropanol, has been used in order to improve degradation rates by initiating the oxidation reaction and increasing temperature of the reaction medium. Concentrations up to 20 wt% were tested for anionic and cationic resins. Total organic carbon reduction rates higher than 99 % were obtained from this process, without the use of a catalyst. The influence of operating parameters such as IERs feed concentration, nature and counterions of exchanged IERs were also studied...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpent ion {{exchange}} resins are <b>radioactive</b> <b>process</b> wastes {{for which there is}} no satisfactory industrial treatment. Supercritical water oxidation could offer a viable treatment alternative to destroy the organic structure of resins and contain radioactivity. IER degradation experiments were carried out in a continuous supercritical water reactor. Total organic carbon degradation rates in the range of 95 - 98 % were obtained depending on operating conditions. GC-MS chromatography analyses were carried out to determine intermediate products formed during the reaction. Around 50 species were identified for cationic and anionic resins. Degradation of polystyrenic structure leads to the formation of low molecular weight compounds. Benzoic acid, phenol and acetic acid are the main compounds. However, other products are detected in appreciable yields such as phenolic species or heterocycles, for anionic IERs degradation. Intermediates produced by intramolecular rearrangements are also obtained. A radical degradation mechanism is proposed for each resin. In this overall mechanism, several hypotheses are foreseen, according to HOOradical dot radical attack sites...|$|E

Among the most fundamental properties of such exotic nuclides, usually established first, is the half-life, possible radioactive decay modes, and their relative probabilities. When approaching limits of nuclear stability, new decay modes set in. First, beta decays become accompanied by emission of nucleons from highly excited states of daughter nuclei. Second, when the nucleon separation energy becomes negative, nucleons start to be emitted from the ground state.

As reported in the physics education literature, among the learning difficulties encountered by the students figures indeed limiting the validity of the principle of conservation of energy to mechanical and thermodynamic processes. The historical case-study here proposed concerns Bohr-Pauli controversy in late 1920 s to early 1930 s about the continuous beta decay spectra. As it is well known, in order to explain this feature of the beta decay, Bohr suggested a violation of the principle of conservation in <b>radioactive</b> <b>processes.</b> On the contrary, Pauli defended the view that the unobserved portions of energy was carried off by one, or more, very light neutral particles, eventually named neutrinos...|$|R

The effectiveness and accuracy of the methods were achieved as the results obtained rapidly converge after few numbers of iterations. The results obtained show that the mean life time of the radioactive materials decreases with time while the decay constant of the radioactive materials increases with time, also it was observed that, the higher the decay constant of a radioactive material, the faster the rate of conversion. _________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

5000|$|X-rays {{normally}} {{have a lower}} energy than gamma rays, and an older convention was to define the boundary as a wavelength of 10−11 m or a photon energy of 100 keV. That threshold was driven by limitations of older X-ray tubes and low awareness of isomeric transitions. Modern technologies and discoveries have resulted in an overlap between X-ray and gamma energies. In many fields they are functionally identical, differing for terrestrial studies only in origin of the radiation. In astronomy, however, where radiation origin often cannot be reliably determined, the old energy division has been preserved, with X-rays defined as being between about 120 eV and 120 keV, and gamma rays as being of any energy above 100 to 120 keV, regardless of source.
