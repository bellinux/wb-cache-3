5|$|The <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> Glacier National Park are {{the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all {{formed in}} the Alleghanian orogeny. This {{happened}} long after the sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that makes up the park today.|$|E

5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, and feed mainly on fruits and seeds, but may also eat herbs and insects. They build nests of leaves and {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, or under <b>rocks.</b> <b>In</b> Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter size is about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and sucking lice have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{reactions}} led to {{the first}} self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> Western Greenland, remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that during the}} Iron Age people farmed the fields and mined the iron-rich <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the Tunbridge Wells area, and excavations in 1940 and 1957–61 by James Money at High Rocks uncovered {{the remains of a}} defensive hill-fort.
