40|$|The [PSI+] prion causes {{widespread}} <b>readthrough</b> <b>translation</b> and is rare {{in natural}} populations of Saccharomyces, {{despite the fact that}} sex is expected to cause it to spread. Using the recently estimated rate of Saccharomyces outcrossing, we calculate the strength of selection necessary to maintain [PSI+] at levels low enough to be compatible with data. Using the best available parameter estimates, we find selection against [PSI+] to be significant. Inference regarding selection on modifiers of [PSI+] appearance depends on obtaining more precise and accurate estimates of the product of yeast effective population size Ne and the spontaneous rate of [PSI+] appearance m. The ability to form [PSI+] has persisted in yeast {{over a long period of}} evolutionary time, despite a diversity of modifiers that could abolish it. If mNe 1, then selection should favor the spread of [PSI+] resistance modifiers. In this case, rare conditions where [PSI+] is adaptive may permit its persistence in the face of negative selection...|$|E
40|$|Epigenetically {{inherited}} aggregates of {{the yeast}} prion [PSI+] cause genomewide <b>readthrough</b> <b>translation</b> that sometimes increases evolvability in certain harsh environments. The effects {{of natural selection}} on modifiers of [PSI+] appearance {{have been the subject}} of much debate. It seems likely that [PSI+] would be at least mildly deleterious in most environments, but this may be counteracted by its evolvability properties on rare occasions. Indirect selection on modifiers of [PSI+] is predicted to depend primarily on the spontaneous [PSI+] appearance rate, but this critical parameter has not previously been adequately measured. Here we measure this epimutation rate accurately and precisely as 5. 8 × 10 − 7 per generation, using a fluctuation test. We also determine that genetic “mimics” of [PSI+] account for up to 80 % of all phenotypes involving general nonsense suppression. Using previously developed mathematical models, we can now infer that even in the absence of opportunities for adaptation, modifiers of [PSI+] are only weakly deleterious relative to genetic drift. If we assume that the spontaneous [PSI+] appearance rate is at its evolutionary optimum, then opportunities for adaptation are inferred to be rare, such that the [PSI+] system is favored only very weakly overall. But when we account for the observed increase in the [PSI+] appearance rate in response to stress, we infer much higher overall selection in favor of [PSI+] modifiers, suggesting that [PSI+]-forming ability may be a consequence of selection for evolvability...|$|E
40|$|Wild-type soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) has RNAs of 1. 0 L and 0. 5 L, {{designated}} by the relative virion lengths. Two isolates, Lab 1 of 1. 0 L and 0. 35 L, Lab 2 of 1. 0 L and 0. 4 L, were selected by repeated mechanical transfer of wild type virions. This study provides the molecular evidences for two proposed characters of SBWMV: (1) SBWMV has two RNA genomes. (2) The 0. 5 RNA suffers deletion mutation to give 0. 4 L and 0. 35 L RNA. ^ Three properties of SBWMV isolates in Nebraska were compared: (1) viral specific proteins in infected tissue, (2) peptide map of coat protein after chemical cleavage, (3) pattern of RNA deletion mutants. Lack of variation by these criteria of virus from fields shows that many wheat fields in Nebraska are infected with similar strains of SBWMV. ^ Translations of all four RNA species in rabbit reticulocyte lysates revealed that RNA I (1. 0 L RNA) and RNA IIs (0. 5 L, 0. 4 L and 0. 35 L RNA) have different coding sequences and the coat protein gene is located on RNA IIs. The results of sequence of appearance of products, immunoprecipitation and peptide mapping demonstrate <b>readthrough</b> <b>translation</b> strategies of RNA IIs. The results also indicate that the deletion occurred near the 32 ̆ 7 end of 0. 5 L RNA to give 0. 4 or 0. 35 L RNA. ^ Sequence relationships among the SBWMV RNAs were demonstrated by Northern hybridization. Hybridization with cDNA revealed that all three isolates have the same RNA I {{and that there is}} no homology among RNA I and RNA IIs. Homology among RNA IIs of different isolates provides further evidence for the deletion hypothesis. ^ Terminal structures of 0. 5 L and 0. 35 L RNAs were compared. Neither RNA had poly (A) nor oligo (A) at the 32 ̆ 7 end. Neither RNA had detectable genome-linked protein nor cap structure at the 52 ̆ 7 end. The results indicate these two RNAs have similar terminal structures. ...|$|E

50|$|Gag/pol {{translational}} readthrough site (or Retroviral readthrough element) is a cis-regulatory element found in retroviruses. The readthrough site facilitates {{the mechanism of}} <b>translation</b> <b>readthrough</b> of the stop codon at the gag-pol junction producing the gag and pol fusion protein in certain retroviruses.Retroviruses whose gag and pol genes {{are in the same}} reading frame often depend upon approximately 5% read-through of the gag UAG termination codon to form the gag-pol polyprotein. This readthrough is usually dependent on a pseudoknot located eight nucleotides downstream of the stop codon (UAG). Sequence conservation is found in the second pseudoknot loop.|$|R
40|$|Inactivation of {{the yeast}} {{nonsense}}-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway stabilizes nonsense mRNAs and promotes <b>readthrough</b> of premature <b>translation</b> termination codons. Although the latter phenotype {{is thought to}} reflect a direct role of NMD factors in translation termination, its mechanism is unknown. Here we show that the reduced termination efficiency of NMD-deficient cells is attributable to increased expression of the magnesium transporter Alr 1 p and the resulting effects of elevated Mg 2 + levels on termination fidelity. Alr 1 p levels increase because an upstream ORF in ALR 1 mRNA targets the transcript for NMD. Our results demonstrate that NMD, at least in yeast, controls Mg 2 + homeostasis and, consequently, translational fidelity...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{sensitive}} (ts) mutant viruses {{have helped}} elucidate replication processes in many viral systems. Several panels of replication-defective ts mutants in which viral RNA synthesis is abolished at the nonpermissive temperature (RNA-) have been isolated for Mouse Hepatitis Virus, MHV (Robb et al., 1979; Koolen et al., 1983; Martin et al., 1988; Schaad et al., 1990). However, {{no one had}} investigated genetic or phenotypic relationships between these different mutant panels. In order {{to determine how the}} panel of MHV-JHM RNA- ts mutants (Robb et al., 1979) were genetically related to other described MHV RNA- ts mutants, the MHV-JHM mutants were tested for complementation with representatives from two different sets of MHV-A 59 ts mutants (Koolen et al., 1983; Schaad et al., 1990). The three ts mutant panels together were found to comprise eight genetically distinct complementation groups. Of these eight complementation groups, three complementation classes are unique to their particular mutant panel; genetically equivalent mutants were not observed within the other two mutant panels. Two complementation groups were common to all three mutant panels. The three remaining complementation groups overlapped two of the three mutant sets. Mutants MHV-JHM tsA 204 and MHV-A 59 ts 261 were shown to be within one of these overlapping complementation groups. The phenotype of the MHV-JHM mutants within this complementation class has been previously characterized (Leibowitz et al., 1982; Leibowitz et al, 1990). When these mutants were grown at the permissive temperature, then shifted up to the nonpermissive temperature at the start of RNA synthesis, genome-length RNA and leader RNA fragments accumulated, but no subgenomic mRNA was synthesized. MHV-A 59 ts 261 produced leader RNA fragments identical to those observed with MHV-JHM tsA 204. Thus, these two MHV RNA- ts mutants that were genetically equivalent by complementation testing were phenotypically similar as well. Recombination frequencies obtained from crosses of MHV-A 59 ts 261 with several of the gene 1 MHV-A 59 mutants indicated that the causal mutation(s) of MHV-A 59 ts 261 was located near the overlapping junction of ORF 1 a and ORF 1 b, in the 3 ' end of ORF 1 a, or the 5 ' end of ORF 1 b. Sequence analysis of this junction and 1400 nucleotides into the 5 ' end of ORF 1 b of MHV-A 59 ts 261 revealed one nucleotide change from the wildtype MHV-A 59. This substitution at nucleotide 13, 598 (A to G) was a silent mutation in the ORF 1 a reading frame, but resulted in an amino acid change in ORF 1 b gene product (I to V). This amino acid change would be expressed only in the <b>readthrough</b> <b>translation</b> product produced upon successful ribosome frameshifting. A revertant of MHV-A 59 ts 261 (R 2) also retained this guanidine residue, but had a second substitution at nucleotide 14, 475 in ORF 1 b. This mutation results in the substitution of valine for an isoleucine. ^ The data presented here suggest that the mutation in MHV-A 59 ts 261 (nucleotide 13, 598) would be responsible for the MHV-JHM complementation group A phenotype. A second-site reversion at nucleotide 14, 475 may correct this defect in the revertant. Sequencing of gene 1 immediately upstream of nucleotide 13, 296 and downstream of nucleotide 15, 010 must be conducted to test this hypothesis. ...|$|E
40|$|Nonsense {{mutations}} inactivate {{gene function}} {{and are the}} underlying cause of {{a large percentage of}} the individual cases of many genetic disorders. PTC 124 is an orally bioavailable compound that promotes <b>readthrough</b> of premature <b>translation</b> termination codons, suggesting that it may have the potential to treat genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations. Using a mouse model for cystic fibrosis (CF), we show that s. c. injection or oral administration of PTC 124 to Cftr-/- mice expressing a human CFTR-G 542 X transgene suppressed the G 542 X nonsense mutation and restored a significant amount of human (h) CFTR protein and function. Translational readthrough of the premature stop codon was demonstrated in this mouse model in two ways. First, immunofluorescence staining showed that PTC 124 treatment resulted in the appearance of hCFTR protein at the apical surface of intestinal glands in Cftr-/- hCFTR-G 542 X mice. In addition, functional assays demonstrated that PTC 124 treatment restored 24 - 29 % of the average cAMP-stimulated transepithelial chloride currents observed in wild-type mice. These results indicate that PTC 124 can effectively suppress the hCFTR-G 542 X nonsense mutation in vivo. In light of its oral bioavailability, safety toxicology profile in animal studies, and efficacy with other nonsense alleles, PTC 124 has the potential to be an important therapeutic agent for the treatment of inherited diseases caused by nonsense mutations...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} {{endogenous}} SsrA-tagged proteins {{have revealed that}} the tagging could occur at a position corresponding to the normal termination codon. During the study of SsrA-mediated Lacl tagging (Abo et al., EMBO J, 2000 19 : 3762 - 3769), we found that a variant Lacl (Lacl deltaC 1) lacking the last C-terminal amino acid residue is efficiently tagged in a stop codon-dependent manner. SsrA tagging of Lacl deltaC 1 occurred efficiently without Lacl binding to the lac operators at any one of three stop codons. The C-terminal (R) LESG peptide of Lacl deltaC 1 was shown to trigger the SsrA tagging of an unrelated protein (CRP) when fused to its C terminus. Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified fusion proteins revealed that SsrA tagging occurs at a position corresponding to the termination codon. The alteration of the amino acid sequence but not the nucleotide sequence of the C-terminal portion eliminated the tagging. We also showed that the tagging-provoking sequences cause an efficient translational readthrough at UGA but not UAA codons. In addition, we found that C-terminal dipeptides known to induce an efficient <b>translation</b> <b>readthrough</b> could cause an efficient tagging at stop codons. We conclude that the amino acid sequence of nascent polypeptide prior to stop codons is a major determinant for the SsrA tagging at all three stop codons...|$|R
40|$|The mature 109 -amino-acid human platelet-derived {{growth factor}} B (PDGF-B) peptide is derived by {{intracellular}} processing from a 241 -amino-acid precursor synthesized in mammalian cells, with removal of 81 N-terminal and 51 C-terminal amino acids. In {{order to produce}} directly the mature 109 -amino acid PDGF-B peptide as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, a CGA codon at position 110 of a DNA sequence encoding the full-length precursor form of PDGF-B was converted into the translation termination codon TGA by in vitro mutagenesis. Expression of this DNA via a plasmid vector in E. coli resulted in production of two distinct PDGF-B proteins having apparent molecular masses of 15 and 19 kDa, with the latter species predominating. Structural characterization employing N- and C-terminal amino acid sequencing and MS analyses indicated that the 15 kDa protein is the expected 109 -amino-acid PDGF-B, and that the 19 kDa protein represents a C-terminal extended PDGF-B containing 160 amino acids. Characterization of a unique tryptic peptide derived from the 19 kDa protein revealed that this longer form of PDGF-B results from mistranslation of the introduced TGA termination codon at position 110 as tryptophan, with translation subsequently proceeding to the naturally occurring TAG termination codon at position 161. Owing to {{the high rate of}} <b>translation</b> <b>readthrough</b> of TGA codons in this and occasionally other proteins, it appears that the use of TGA as a translation termination codon for proteins to be expressed in E. coli should be avoided when possible...|$|R
40|$|Although substitutive {{therapy in}} {{coagulation}} factor deficiencies has recently evolved towards proteins with extended half-life and reduced risk for complications, {{the quality of}} life of patients would be significantly ameliorated by innovative approaches, based on alternative strategies and able to provide prolonged/permanent expression of therapeutic levels of the defective factor. Among these, rescuing the altered pre-RNA processing/maturation and mRNA translation has received particular attention because it would in principle permit to restore expression of the mutated gene still maintaining its physiological regulation in the competent tissues, especially hepatocytes which efficiently deliver several coagulation proteins. More recently, gene editing approaches permit specific DNA sequence recognition, cleavage and thus repair/correction of mutated genes in the appropriate cells. Here we focus on molecular mechanisms supporting innovative approaches for restoring transcription, maturation and translation of mRNAs in inherited coagulation factor deficiencies: By engineering transcription activator-like effectors fused with an activation domain (TALE-TFs), able to specifically rescue the coagulation factor VII promoter activity impaired by severe disease-causing mutations. In turn, this triggers synthesis of factor VII mRNA and secretion of functional factor VII protein. By engineering the key component of the spliceosome, the small nuclear RNA U 1 (U 1 snRNA), able to prevent exon skipping in mutated factor VII and factor IX pre-mRNA exon-intron junctions. In turn, this triggers synthesis of correct mRNA and secretion of functional factors. By aminoglycoside drugs inducing ribosome <b>readthrough</b> on premature <b>translation</b> termination codons affecting factor VII. This permits synthesis of full length protein with procoagulant function instead of truncated non-functional molecules. Depending on the approach and mutations affecting patients' mRNA, we report in cellular and animal models expression levels ranging from negligible to the rescue of potentially therapeutic amounts of coagulation factor activity. Our data support further studies aimed at evaluating clinical translatability of specific molecules in selected groups of patients...|$|R
