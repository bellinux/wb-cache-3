Berman said [...] "I've <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the criticisms and I understand how some people feel, but [...] and I {{spent a lot of time}} coming up with the idea and a somewhat, I would say, unique ending to a series, especially when you’re ending it prematurely. [...] You never like to disappoint people, but I think it's nonsense to say that it was more a Next Generation episode than an Enterprise episode. The only elements of [...] that were present were there as a sounding board to allow us to look at a mission that took place six years after [...] "Terra Prime"." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Marion McMullen from the Coventry Evening Telegraph, Davies explained that the Gothic elements to the novel gave him inspiration to add dream sequences and fantasies to the script. He told McMullen, [...] "I've been very faithful to the book, {{but one of the}} differences has been writing the scenes showing Catherine's fantasies. Catherine is a great reader of horror fiction – the gothic novel was fairly popular in those days, like a young girl today who would <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> rather steamy romances. In this production, we see some of Catherine's fantasies, some of which are quite steamy for a young girl." [...] Davies admitted that he was proud of his reputation for [...] "sexing up" [...] the novels he had adapted and commented that none of his scenes were gratuitous. He told McMullen that he often looked for excuses to get the characters out of their clothes, as he felt they were always being [...] "buttoned up to the neck". Producer Keith Thompson said Davies had made Northanger Abbey a bit more erotic than the novel and thought the script had [...] "a wonderful cheekiness to it." [...] Davies chose to use a narrator to speak Austen's words and help set the scene {{at the beginning and end}} of the film.|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, in 1562, Marroquin left in {{his will}} some funds to set up a school, the Santo Tomás de Aquino, where [...] Grammar, Arts, Philosophy and Theology would be taught. The {{beneficiaries}} of this pious enterprise would be the children of poor Spaniards, given that they could not travel to cities (like Mexico) where the Royal Universities were. This will has been also interpreted by scholars as the origin of the University of San Carlos. However, the late priest had a clear idea of the difference between a school (i.e., a home for students, with or without classes) and a university (or General Study) where the students earned degrees. About this, historian John Tate Lanning tells that [...] "his will is so well known that there are some scholars that have not even seen it and have already <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things that are not there at all.

6000|$|It is a {{long while}} since I've felt so good for nothing as I do this morning. My very {{wristbands}} curl up in a dog's-eared and disconsolate manner; my little room is all a heap of disorder. I've got a hoarseness and wheezing and sneezing and coughing and choking. I can't speak and I can't think, I'm miserable in bed and useless out of it; {{and it seems to}} me as if I could never venture to open a window or go out of a door any more. I have the dimmest sort of diabolical pleasure in thinking how miserable I shall make Susie by telling her all this; but in other respects I seem entirely devoid of all moral sentiments. I have arrived at this state of things, first by catching cold, and since by trying to [...] "amuse myself" [...] for three days. I tried to read [...] "Pickwick," [...] but found that vulgar,[24] and, besides, I know it all by heart. I sent from town for some chivalric romances, but found them immeasurably stupid. I made Baxter read me the Daily Telegraph, and found that the Home Secretary had been making an absurd speech about art, without any consciousness that such a person as I had ever existed. I <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> games of chess out of Mr. Staunton's handbook, and couldn't understand any of them. I analyzed the Dock Company's bill of charges on a box from Venice, and sent them an examination paper on it. I think that did amuse me a little, but the account doesn't. £1 8s. 6d. for bringing a box two feet square from the Tower Wharf to here! But the worst of all is, that the doctor keeps me shut up here, and I can't get my business done; and now there isn't the least chance of my getting down to Brantwood for Christmas, nor, as far as I can see, for a fortnight after it. There's perhaps a little of the diabolical enjoyment again in that estimate; but really the days do go, more like dew shaken off branches than real sunrisings and settings. But I'll send you word every day now for a little while how things are going on.|$|E
