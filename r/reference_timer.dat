40|$|AAL 2 {{has been}} adopted in ITU-T and ATM Forum to reduce the packing delay for voice trunking. A {{parameter}} called "Timer_CU" is used in AAL 2 to avoid prolonged delay for any packet. However, the AAL 2 documents do not discuss how to set the Timer_CU value. In this paper, we establish a Markov chain model to analyze the AAL 2 packing process. We find that the packing density and link efficiency depend significantly on the Timer CU value. The analysis of this paper gives an algorithm to calculate a <b>reference</b> <b>Timer</b> CU value to achieve desired link efficiency. Simulation results that verify the analysis are also presented...|$|E
50|$|Although it {{does not}} seem {{possible}} for a page to be not referenced yet modified, this happens when a class 3 page has its referenced bit cleared by the timer interrupt. The NRU algorithm picks a random page from the lowest category for removal. So out of the above four pages, the NRU algorithm will replace the not referenced, not modified. Note that this algorithm implies that a modified but not <b>referenced</b> (within last <b>timer</b> interval) page is less important than a not modified page that is intensely referenced.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{integrating}} ADC circuit {{consists of}} an integrator, a switch to select between the voltage to be measured and the <b>reference</b> voltage, a <b>timer</b> that determines how long to integrate the unknown and measures how long the reference integration took, a comparator to detect zero crossing, and a controller. Depending on the implementation, a switch may also be present in parallel with the integrator capacitor to allow the integrator to be reset [...] Inputs to the controller include a clock (used to measure time) and the output of a comparator used to detect when the integrator's output reaches zero.|$|R
40|$|A {{status report}} is {{presented}} {{for a time}} transfer experiment which compares the times of flight in the east-west and west-east directions of short pulses of light sent from a laser coupled to the 48 -inch telescope at the NASA Goddard Optical Research Facility to the U. S. Naval Observatory and reflected back over the same path. The times t and t when each light pulse leaves GORE and returns are measured 1 3 with an event <b>timer</b> <b>referenced</b> to a hydrogen maser. The time t 2 when the pulse is reflected at USNO is measured with a portable event timer and maser combination carried in a heated and air-conditioned truck. Each maser is mintained in a temperature-controlled environment. The portable maser enclosure is supported by pnemtic shock and vibration suppression mounts. The quantity is determined. The apparatus is calibrated by performing correspondin...|$|R
