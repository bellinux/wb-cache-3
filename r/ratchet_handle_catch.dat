5000|$|A ratchet is a {{mechanical}} device that allows continuous linear or rotary motion {{in only one}} direction while preventing motion in the opposite direction. Ratchets are widely used in machinery and tools. Though something of a misnomer, [...] "ratchet" [...] is also often {{used to refer to}} ratcheting socket wrenches, a common tool with a <b>ratcheting</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|R

50|$|Returning {{from the}} called {{function}} will pop the top frame {{off of the}} stack, perhaps leaving a return value. The more general act of popping one or more frames off the stack to resume execution elsewhere in the program is called stack unwinding and must be performed when non-local control structures are used, such as those used for exception handling. In this case, the stack frame of a function contains one or more entries specifying exception handlers. When an exception is thrown, the stack is unwound until a handler is found that is prepared to <b>handle</b> (<b>catch)</b> the type of the thrown exception.|$|R

50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the ratcheting socket wrench, often improperly called a ratchet. A ratcheting socket wrench is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} ratcheting mechanism, which attaches to a socket, which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the ratchet loosens or tightens the bolt or nut attached to the socket. Turned the other direction, the ratchet does not turn the socket but allows the <b>ratchet</b> <b>handle</b> to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This ratcheting action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the ratchet head that allows the user to apply the ratcheting action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving socket wrenches include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|R
5000|$|Some sockets are {{designed}} {{to have the same}} outside diameter and shape within a given set size. Each pass-through socket, within a given socket set, is designed to be used with a [...] "special" [...] ratchet that fits {{on the outside of the}} socket and not to the middle of the socket. By fitting the outside of the socket they allow the bolt or stud to extend through the socket, eliminating the need for a deep socket in some applications. By attaching to the outside of the socket they also allow the socket to be built up to 50% shorter and with 20% less width which is an advantage in some situations. Pass-through sockets and ratchets are built for 1/4", 3/8" [...] and 1/2" [...] sets in both SAE and metric sizes. By using a fine tooth ratchet and socket system that allow a pass-through ratchet to be used as a conventional <b>ratchet</b> <b>handle</b> with interchangeable 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch drives some ratchets can be used with standard sockets. They are built by a number of manufacturers with a variety of trade names. Craftsman Tools call theirs--Max Axess, and also sells GearWrench's Pass-Thru brands. Lowes calls their socket system Xtreme Access, etc.. Ratcheting box end wrenches can often be employed in the same application but will nearly always be significantly wider.|$|R

50|$|In most braces, {{immediately}} {{behind the}} chuck is a three position gear release which allows <b>ratcheting</b> of the <b>handle</b> when in tight spots. Turning the gear {{release from the}} center position allows ratcheting the brace in the direction needed. Turning the gear release fully clockwise lets it remove wood in a clockwise direction with the ratchet action going counter-clockwise. Placing the gear release fully counter-clockwise then allows turning the brace and bit in a counter-clockwise direction, usually to remove the drill bit from the hole. The center position of the gear release prohibits the ratcheting effect.|$|R
40|$|PGV {{proposes that}} the GRP be amended to allow PGV {{to develop and}} operate a 60 MW {{geothermal}} power project consisting ofmultiple power generating units up to 30 geothermal wells drilled within the subject property, brine and steam pipelines, pollution control equipment, steam separators, production and injection wells, associated wellfield equipment, holding ponds, switch yards, office buildings, warehouses, workshops, control buildings, access roads, and auxiliary facilities such as an air compressors, fire protection equipment, etc., all {{in a manner consistent}} with applicable standards and permits. The project will occupy approximately 25 net acres ofsurface area located within the Kapoho Section ofthe Kilauea Lower East Rift Geothermal Resource Subzone. Each drilling site will be engineered to support the drilling equipment and to keep drilling effluent contained on site and separate from any natural drainage. Each wellpad will have drilling mud pits, sumps with gently sloped walls used to temporarily store drilling wastes which typically consist of rock cuttings, waste drilling mud, cement particles, lost-circulation material and other drilling mud additives, and other waste drilling liquids. The high porosity of the volcanic soils and rock in the site area results in rapid downward percolation of rainwater. Berms will be provided to contain possible spills in areas where chemicals are <b>handled.</b> <b>Catch</b> basins, culverts, ditches, and berms will be provided for drainage control. In accordance with the requirements of the Department of Health NSP, geothermal emissions will be vented through an approved abatement device during well/pipeline cleanouts. Noise will be generated during well drilling, construction, and operational phases of the project. However, the sites have been located in agricultural areas away from urban population concentrations. The sites will also be located to take advantage of existing topography and vegetation to muffle or block noise from the drilling operations. ...|$|R
40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) cantilevers {{have proven}} to be very effective mass sensors. The attachment of a small mass to a vibrating cantilever produces a resonance frequency shift that can be monitored, providing the ability to measure mass changes down to a few molecules resolution. Nevertheless, the lack of a practical method to <b>handle</b> the <b>catch</b> and release process required for dynamic weighting of microobjects strongly hindered the application of the technology beyond proof of concept measurements. Here, a method is proposed in which FluidFM hollow cantilevers are exploited to overcome the standard limitations of AFM-based mass sensors, providing high throughput single object weighting with picogram accuracy. The extension of the dynamic models of AFM cantilevers to hollow cantilevers was discussed and the effectiveness of mass weighting in air was validated on test samples...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{final report}} of the project DANTEQ (2010 - 2015). Through this project new {{competence}} and new methods for optimal handling of whitefish onboard with respect to raw material quality and energy efficiency have been developed. The project was divided into four research areas; (1) <b>catch</b> <b>handling,</b> (2) chilling and freezing, (3) energy systems and (4) modelling. The main results are given below: Short time live storage of fish befare killing: When towing times are short and catches are small a survival of 50 - 80 % was found for cod (density of fish in the storage tank varied from 120 to 550 kg/m 3). The fishing depth has influence on survival rate. The stress level of the fish was lower straight after catch than after storage in live holding tanks onboard (not always significant differences). Less blood was found in fillets from live stored fish and fish processed straight after catch compared to commercial processed fish. Electro stunning of fish: Voltage of 40 V DC is enough to achieve satisfactory immobilizing and easier <b>handling</b> of <b>catch</b> in connection with further processing (bleeding/gutting/heading) for cod, haddock and saithe. Three rows of electrodes on the stunner (current load for 4 - 6 seconds) is enough to achieve satisfactory immobilization. Electro stunning of saithe lead to broken backbone and bloodspots on 10 to 40 % of the fish. Freezing of cod: Pre-rigor cod frozen in a magnetic field ((ell Alive System) achieved minimal differences in quality compared to traditional tunnel freezing and freezing in a cold room, in spite of different freezing rates. The mechanism for freezing of fish in magnetic field appeared {{to be similar to}} that of traditional freezing methods. Chilling of cod and haddock: Fish stored in slurry had a different microstructure and different water distribution, measured by low field NMR, than those stored in flake ice. Differences in colour and QIM­score were found for haddock stored under the two conditions. Logging of operational data: Software for acquisition and storage of operational data has been developed. Systems for acquisition and storage of operational data, as well as transfer of the data to an on-shore server, have been installed on-board two trawlers. Software for efficient analysis of operational data has been developed and used to generate operational profiles. Model development: Methods and models for simulating <b>catch</b> <b>handling</b> processes have been developed, along with proof-of-concept software that demonstrates their practical use. Discrete event simulation seems to be a very suitable method for 5 imulating and evaluating fish processing lines, though more work needs to be done with regards to model quality and validation. Acquiring high-quality data about <b>catch</b> <b>handling</b> processes for modelling purposes is difficult and labour-intensive. Future experiments should be designed to focus more on individual processes and less on the whole line, and should aim to keep better track of the "human factors" that add noise and affect the outcome...|$|R
25|$|Factors {{which have}} contributed to {{increasing}} catches of fish include {{an increasing number of}} mechanised and motorised boats, installation of fish aggregating devices which improve the efficiency of fishing activities, and improvements in infrastructure for collecting and <b>handling</b> the fish <b>catch.</b> Of the pelagic species, skipjack tuna has been almost exclusively exploited. The pelagic fisheries may have considerable expansion potential, especially further from the coast, targeting species such as yellowfin. Demersal and reef species can also be exploited at higher levels. At present, development is limited by limited local facilities for storing and transporting fish.|$|R

25|$|For {{individual}} performances, a gymnast manipulates one or {{two pieces}} of apparatus (double rings, stick, clubs, rope) to demonstrate their skill at apparatus <b>handling,</b> throws, and <b>catches</b> {{as well as the}} difficulty of the tumbling. The gymnast must work the entire floor area whilst showing continuous flowing movement. The permitted time for individual events is between 1 minute 15 seconds to 1 minute 30 seconds. During a competition, each individual gymnast performs four separate routines, one for each apparatus. Points are based a 20-point scale. The first 10-point scale measures composition (difficulty) based on technical value, variety, harmony between music and movements and originality, while the execution of performance is a maximum of 10 points. The individual scores of all four routines for each gymnast are then added up to decide the all-around winner.|$|R
