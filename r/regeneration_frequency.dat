40|$|Abstract An {{efficient}} {{system for}} high frequency plant regeneration was established through investigating various {{factors such as}} plant growth regulator combinations, explant types and ages, and addition of AgNO 3 influenced on shoot regene-ration in Brassica juncea L. cv. BARI sarisha- 10. Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 0. 1 mg/L NAA (1 -naphthaleneacetic acid) and 1 mg/L BA (6 -benzyladenine) showed the maximum shoot <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> (56. 67 %) among the different combinations of NAA and BA. Explant type, explant age, and addition of AgNO 3 also significantly affected shoot regeneration. Of the four type of explants (cotyledon, hypocotyl, root, and leaf explants) - cotyledon explants produced the highest shoot <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> and hypocotyls explants produced the highest number of shoots per explant, whereas root explants did not produce any shoot. The cotyledonary explants from Four-day-old seedlings showed the maximum shoot <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> and number of shoots per explant. Shoot <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> increased significantly by adding AgNO 3 to the medium. Two mg/L AgNO 3 appeared to be the best for shoot regeneration with the highest shoot <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> (86. 67 %) and number of shoots per explant (7. 5 shoots). Considerable variation in shoot regeneration from cotyledonay explants was observed within the B. juncea L. genotypes. The shoot <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> ranged from 47. 78 % for cv.

40|$|The {{effects of}} phyA and phyB {{mutations}} on shoot bud regeneration in Arabidopsis thaliana have been studied. The phyB mutant showed a significantly lower frequency of shoot bud regeneration {{than did the}} wild-type, indicating a role for phytochrome B in the regulation of in-vitro shoot bud regeneration. Interestingly, the shoot bud <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> of the phyA mutant was {{not significantly different from}} that of the wild-type in a light and dark, suggesting that phytochrome A may not be involved in the regulation of in-vitro shoot bud regeneration. The effects of gibberellin (GA) were also studied because previously we showed that a reduction in endogenous GA level results in a higher shoot bud <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency.</b> Exogenous paclobutrazol and prohexadione (GA biosynthesis inhibitors) increases, and exogenous GA reduces, the shoot bud <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> in the phyB mutant.

40|$|Cotyledon {{and leaf}} {{segments}} of stem mustard (Brassica juncea var. tsatsai) were cultured on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with various concentrations of different cytokinins [6 -benzyladenine (BA), N-(2 -chloro- 4 -pyridyl) -n-phenylurea (CPPU), 6 -furfurylaminopurine (KT) and thidiazuron (TDZ) ] in combinations with {{different levels of}} ¿-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). The shoot <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> of cotyledon and leaf segment was dependent on the kinds and concentrations of cytokinins used in the medium, while in most cases cotyledon gave high <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> than leaf segment. TDZ {{proved to be the}} best cytokinin to induce shoot from both cotyledon and leaf segments compared to BA, KT and CPPU. The highest frequency of shoot regeneration was 61. 3 ¿ 67. 9 % in cotyledon and 40. 7 ¿ 52. 4 % in leaf segment respectively when 2. 27 or 4. 54 ¿M TDZ was combined with 5. 37 ¿M NAA.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop an}} in vitro {{regeneration}} system {{to increase the}} recovery of Carum copticum L. plantlets {{as a part of}} developing a metabolic engineering program. Methods: The efficacy of different concentrations and combinations of 6 -benzyladenine, indole- 3 -acetic acid and indole butyric acid on direct shoot regeneration and rooting of ajowan from apical bud explants were assessed. All explants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different combinations of 6 -benzyl amino purine (BAP) (0, 2. 2, 4. 4, 8. 8 μmol/L) and indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) (0, 0. 5, 1. 1, 2. 2 μmol/L). Results: The maximum shoot <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> (97. 5 %) and the highest number of shoots produced from apical buds (34 shoots per explant) were obtained on MS medium fortified with BAP (4. 4 μmol/L) and IAA (0. 5 μmol/L). Low shoot <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> was observed in BAP free treatments. The effects of different strengths of MS medium and various concentrations of IAA and indole- 3 -butyric acid on rooting rate, length and average number of roots were also investigated. Application of indole- 3 -butyric acid (6 μmol/L) in full-strength MS medium, was more effective than IAA and resulted in highest shoot <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> with the rooting rate of 100 % and highest mean number of roots per shoot (41. 8). The rooted plantlets were acclimatized successfully in greenhouse conditions with a survival rate of 90 %. Conclusion: In this study, a simple and reliable regeneration and acclimatization protocol for Carum copticum has been presented.

Different preculture media were screened for efficient protection of banana meristems during cryopreservation. Sucrose can be replaced by both fructose and glucose without significantly affecting post-thaw survival. A high BA concentration (100 muM) in the preculture medium results in less material available for cryopreservation, but does not affect cryoprotection. Culture in liquid media significantly improved post-thaw regeneration. The optimized cryopreservation protocol was applied on 36 banana accessions belonging to 8 different genomic groups.

40|$|Abstract Reciprocal {{differences}} {{persist in}} nature because of the unequal contribution of cytoplasmic determinants from male and female gametes to the zygote. The inheritance of genetic differences {{is an important factor}} that influences various traits, including somatic embryogenesis and regeneration in vitro. In this report, we estimate the cytoplasmic and maternal effects in pearl millet and their adequacy in describing the observed reciprocal differences based on an in depth study of the parents, F 2 s and reciprocal backcross progenies needed for fitting genetical models. Our study revealed that of the two characters examined, embryogenic callus quantity and <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency,</b> the former showed a greater proportion of cytoplasmic nuclear interaction whereas the latter showed a greater role of nuclear factors. Additive-maternal effects influenced total callus quantity and dominance-maternal effects influenced total callus quantity, embryogenic callus quantity and <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency.</b> Dwarfing was associated with the production of large quantities of embryogenic callus that had visually recognizable characteristics. The phenotypic nature of dwarf parents (green dwarf with long narrow leaves) with a genetic basis for a given character controlled by nuclear and cytoplasmic determinants can be exploited for other breeding programs...|$|E

Lancaster inbreds of Ukrainian selection DК 267, DК 6080 and DК 298 and lines PLS 61, A 188 and Chi 31 of foreign selection which represented eponymous heterotic groups were selected for into the research. For callusogenesis induction immature embryos of 1. 0 – 1. 5 mm in length were planted on a modified N 6 medium with 30 g/l sucrose. For regeneration the 30 -day callus tissue was transplanted to a modified MS medium containing 20 g/l sucrose and various PAS: 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP) (0. 1 mg/l) or indolylbutyric acid (IBA) (1. 0 mg/l), or cefotaxime (CT) (150  mg/l). Morphogenesis and plant regeneration were obtained in callus tissue by organogenesis through the formation of leaf-like structures or shoots only without roots (hemmogenesis) and by embryogenesis through the development of embryos with the cooperative laying of the apexes of the shoot and the root. The predominant type of in vitro morphogenesis in both groups of genotypes was organogenesis. A tendency to increasing the embryogenesis level among Lancaster inbreds in comparison with the other investigated groups was observed. A certain tendency to increase the level of embryogenesis on a medium for regeneration with IBA, compared to other PAS, was marked. So, for the Lancaster group the embryogenesis level on the medium with IBA was 33. 3 %, while for the other investigated genotypes it was about 10. 3 %. <b>Regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> was 45. 8 plantlets/ 100 calli for Lancaster inbred DК 298, 42. 2  plantlets/ 100 calli for DК 267 and 5. 6 plantlets/ 100 calli for DК 6080. <b>Regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> of inbred PLS 61 was 204. 0 plantlets/ 100  calli, 100. 0 plantlets/ 100 calli for Chi 31 and 11. 1 plantlets/ 100 calli for А 188. Observed reductions in capacityfor plant regeneration of Lancaster inbreds may have been due to their pedigree. These inbreds belong to the commercial heterotic group that was not specially selected for increased regenerative ability, unlike the model inbreds of other heterotic groups. Overall, the level of <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> in the Lancaster group was 44. 8  plantlets/ 100 calli on the medium under BAP, 41. 4 plantlets/ 100 calli under IBA, and 20. 7 plantlets/ 100 calli with CT.

Anther culture {{has become one of the}} most frequent and well-established methods for the induction of haploid embryogenesis and regeneration in barley. Anther culture is easily reproduced and workable for a wide range of genotypes. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal pre-treatment for barley anther culture. Three pre-treatments, 0. 3 M Mannitol, 0. 7 M Mannitol and a cold treatment with a moist cloth (CMC), were studied. The results suggest that CMC is the optimal pre-treatment to use for green plant regeneration. Anthers treated with CMC showed a higher response percentage than that of 0. 7 M Mannitol and 0. 3 M Mannitol. CMC also induced a significantly higher callus formation and green plant <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequencies</b> than 0. 7 M Mannitol and 0. 3 M Mannitol. Further research has to be conducted to further optimize green plant yields per treatment as well as reduce the number of albinos regenerated through barley anther culture...|$|R
40|$|High {{frequency}} {{somatic embryogenesis}} {{can be obtained}} over a 7 - 8 month culture period when using current routing coffee tree micropropagation protocols. To reduce this response time and improve the embryo formation yield, eight different media were tested for primary culture. These media differed from the classically used ones by their mineral nitrogen and plant growth regulator concentrations. An increase from 0. 66 to 0. 75 in the NO 3 /NO 3 +NH 4 ratio and a 2 -fold lower plant growth regulator concentration in the primary culture medium led to substantial improvements in terms of rapidity and embryo/plantlet <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Embryo development time was reduced by up to 3 months with a 5 -fold {{increase in the number}} of formed embryos. These results were obtained for the two cultivated coffee tree species, Coffea canephora and C. arabica, and for a wild one, C. heterocalyx, but not for a second wild species, C. sp. Moloundou showing a species-specific response. The new conditions described in this paper led to a substantial enhancement that should be particularly helpful for clonal propagation and genetic engineering of cultivated coffee plants...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA new {{and rapid}} {{protocol}} for optimum callus production and complete plant regeneration has been assessed in Malaysian upland rice (Oryza sativa) cv. Panderas. The effect of {{plant growth regulator}} (PGR) on the <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> of Malaysian upland rice (cv. Panderas) was investigated. Mature seeds were used as a starting material for callus induction experiment using various concentrations of 2, 4 -D and NAA. Optimal callus induction frequency at 90 % was obtained on MS media containing 2, 4 -D (3 mgL− 1) and NAA (2 mgL− 1) after 6 weeks while no significant difference was seen on tryptophan and glutamine parameters. Embryogenic callus was recorded as compact, globular and light yellowish in color. The embryogenic callus morphology was further confirmed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. For regeneration, induced calli were treated with various concentrations of Kin (0. 5 – 1. 5 mgL− 1), BAP, NAA and 0. 5 mgL− 1 of TDZ. The result showed that the maximum <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequency</b> (100 %) was achieved on MS medium containing BAP (0. 5 mgL− 1), Kin (1. 5 mgL− 1), NAA (0. 5 mgL− 1) and TDZ (0. 5 mgL− 1) within four weeks. Developed shoots were successfully rooted on half strength MS free hormone medium and later transferred into a pot containing soil for acclimatization. This cutting-edge finding is unique over the other existing publishable data due to the good regeneration response by producing {{a large number of}} shoots...|$|E

40|$|Two methods {{designed}} to parameterize mesoscale processes in a three-dimensional numerical cloud model via boundary layer momentum and heat flux are presented and {{compared to the}} commonly used technique of an initial perturbation placed within the model initial condition. The flux techniques use a continuously reinforced convergent low-level wind or thermal field to produce upward vertical motion {{on the order of}} 10 s of cm s- 1, by which deep moist convection can be initiated. The sensitivity of the convective response to the strength and size of the forcing is tested in numerical simulations using a conditionally unstable environment with weak unidirectional shear. Precipitation-free simulations using the momentum and heat flux techniques are compared to comparable simulations performed using the traditional “initiating bubble ” method. The three methods tested produced an initial convective response, but only the momentum and heat flux methods were able to produce sustained deep convection. Cell <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequencies</b> varied from 8 to over 20 minutes, depending on the forcing magnitude, location with respect to the surface, and geometric shape. The momentum flux forcing scheme produced the most consistent series of convective cells during the 90 minute simulations. 22...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} for efficient transformation of Streptomyces ambofaciens and Streptomyces fradiae protoplasts with plasmid DNA was developed. Transformation frequencies with S. fradiae protoplasts were {{strongly influenced by}} the temperatures for cell growth, protoplast formation, and protoplast <b>regeneration.</b> Transformation <b>frequencies</b> for both species were also influenced by the culture age before protoplast formation, the source and concentration of polyethylene glycol, the transformation-inducing agent, the concentration of protoplasts used in the transformation procedure, {{and the number of}} protoplasts added to <b>regeneration</b> plates. Transformation <b>frequencies</b> were substantially higher for both species when calf thymus DNA and protamine sulfate were added to the transformation mix. With S. fradiae, transformation frequencies were much lower with plasmid DNA prepared from other species than with the same plasmids prepared from S. fradiae, suggesting that S. fradiae expresses restriction and modification. With the modified transformation procedures using DNA prepared from homologous hosts, S. ambofaciens and S. fradiae are now transformed routinely at frequencies of 10 (6) to 10 (7) transformants per micrograms of plasmid DNA...|$|R
40|$|This report {{highlights}} {{the first successful}} cryopreservation of in vitro shoot tips of Cleome rosea, achieved by the vitrification technique using aluminum cryo-plates (V cryo-plate). The effects on survival and recovery of C. rosea shoot tips of different plant vitrification solutions (PVS 2 and PVS 3), light intensity (standard and dim light), and 6 -benzyladenine (BA) supplementation (0. 10, 0. 25, or 0. 50 mg L- 1 for 1 or 3 wk) in the recovery medium were investigated. Cryopreserved shoot tips showed high <b>regeneration</b> <b>frequencies</b> when treated with PVS 2 and PVS 3, reaching survival frequencies of 97 and 70 %, respectively. When placed onto medium without growth regulators, recovery of cryopreserved shoot tips did not exceed 33 % (obtained with PVS 2) or 23 % (PVS 3). Supplementation of recovery medium with 0. 5 mg L- 1 BA for 3 wk increased both survival and recovery to 100 % after cryopreservation following treatment with either PVS 2 or PVS 3. These values were maintained even when shoot tips were cultured {{in the presence of}} 0. 10 mg L- 1 BA for 1 wk. Maintenance under dim light resulted in better phenotypic characteristics of plants produced from cryopreserved shoot tips...|$|R
