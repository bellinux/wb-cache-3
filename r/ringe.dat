40|$|Background: Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) of the Beaufort Sea enter {{hyperphagia}} {{in spring}} and gain fat reserves to survive periods of low prey availability. We collected information on seals killed by polar bears (n = 650) and hunting attempts on <b>ringed</b> seal (Pusa hispida) lairs (n = 1396) observed from a helicopter during polar bear mark-recapture studies in the eastern Beaufort Sea in spring in 1985 – 2011. We investigated how temporal shifts in <b>ringed</b> seal reproduction affect kill composition and the intraspecific vulnerabilities of <b>ringed</b> seals to polar bear predation. Principal Findings: Polar bears primarily preyed on <b>ringed</b> seals (90. 2 %) while bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) only comprised 9. 8 % of the kills, but 33 % of the biomass. Adults comprised 43. 6 % (150 / 344) of the <b>ringed</b> seals killed, while their pups comprised 38. 4 % (132 / 344). Juvenile <b>ringed</b> seals were killed at the lowest proportion, comprising 18. 0 % (62 / 344) of the <b>ringed</b> seal kills. The proportion of <b>ringed</b> seal pups was highest between 2007 – 2011, in association with high <b>ringed</b> seal productivity. Half of the adult <b>ringed</b> seal kills were $ 21 years (60 / 121), and kill rates of adults increased following the peak of parturition.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a model of}} <b>ringed</b> accretion disk, made up by several rings rotating around a supermassive Kerr black hole attractor. Each toroid of the <b>ringed</b> disk is governed by the General Relativity hydrodynamic Boyer condition of equilibrium configurations of rotating perfect fluids. Properties of the tori can be then determined by an appropriately defined effective potential reflecting the background Kerr geometry and the centrifugal effects. The <b>ringed</b> disks could be created in various regimes during the evolution of matter configurations around supermassive black holes. Therefore, both corotating and counterrotating rings {{have to be considered}} as being a constituent of the <b>ringed</b> disk. We provide constraints on the model parameters for the existence and stability of various <b>ringed</b> configurations and discuss occurrence of accretion onto the Kerr black hole and possible launching of jets from the <b>ringed</b> disk. We demonstrate that various <b>ringed</b> disks can be characterized by a maximum number of rings.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{estimates of}} annual survival rates of tawny owls (Strix aluco) <b>ringed</b> in southern Finland from several different sampling methods: recoveries of birds <b>ringed</b> as young; recaptures of birds <b>ringed</b> as young; recoveries of birds <b>ringed</b> as adults {{as well as}} young; combined recoveries and recaptures of birds <b>ringed</b> as young, and combined recoveries and recaptures of birds <b>ringed</b> as adults and young. From 1979 to 1998, 18 040 young owls were <b>ringed,</b> of which 983 were recaptured as breeders in subsequent years during this period, and 1764 were recovered dead at various locations. In addition, 1751 owls were <b>ringed</b> as adults, of which 612 were later recaptured and 199 were recovered dead. First-year survival rates estimated using only recoveries of birds <b>ringed</b> as young averaged 48 %, while apparent survival rates estimated using only recaptures from birds <b>ringed</b> as young averaged 10 - 13 %. Use of combined recapture-recovery models, or supplementary information from recoveries of birds <b>ringed</b> as adults, produced survival estimates of 30 - 37 %. Survival estimates from young-recoveries-only models were biased high, because of violation of the assumption of constant recovery rates with age: birds dying in their first-year were one-third {{less likely to be}} found and reported than older birds. In contrast, recaptures-only models confounded emigration with mortality. Despite these differences in mean values, annual fluctuations in estimated first-year survival rates were similar with all models. Estimates of adult survival rates were similar with all models, while those for second-year birds were similar for all models except recaptures-only. These results highlight the potential biases associated with analysing either recaptures or recoveries alone of birds <b>ringed</b> as young, and the benefits of using combined data. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ringed</b> seals are the {{smallest}} and most abundant {{member of the}} seal family {{that live in the}} Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions. The average life span of a <b>ringed</b> seal is 40 years, with a diet based mainly on Arctic cod and planktonic crustaceans. Typically about 5 ft long, the <b>ringed</b> seal is known to be solitary with their main predator being polar bears. Recently, however, the biggest predator to <b>ringed</b> seals has been the changing temperature in the Arctic and the detrimental changes to sea ice that follow. With declines in snowpack and sea ice due to warming ocean and atmospheric temperatures, survival has become tougher for <b>ringed</b> seals in the Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions. Yet <b>ringed</b> seals are also potentially projected to thrive due to warming, considering the early extinction of their predators. Climate change is sure to change the fate of all <b>ringed</b> seals in the coming years for better or worse.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ringed</b> seal {{is a very}} {{important}} link in the food chain, separating primary producers from primary predators. Historically the <b>ringed</b> seal was the most abundant of any other seals in the Arctic, yet this species has had its share of population slumps. First there was over-harvesting of the <b>ringed</b> seal, drastically dropping numbers from about 200,000 in 1900 to only 4,000 in the 1970s. Secondly, pollution from organocholrides due to DDT and other residues caused many Arctic marine mammals including the <b>ringed</b> seal to become sterile. Sterility still affects many marine mammals living in the Arctic, being a mechanism of bioaccumulation within the Arctic food web. The <b>ringed</b> seal is not fragile considering their past, yet climate change will have the greatest population effect on the <b>ringed</b> seals thus far due to anthropogenic causes.|$|R
50|$|The {{future of}} <b>ringed</b> seal {{populations in the}} Arctic and Sub Arctic is uncertain, but two main {{projections}} surface based around habitat and predators. The first projection focuses on the direct {{effects of climate change}} on sea-ice and the limited environment that it will provide the <b>ringed</b> seal with. The majority of past research has been focused around this main idea of quicker melting sea ice leading to lower <b>ringed</b> seal populations from lack of breeding areas. Yet what most research has not also taken into account is the quick drop in polar bear populations. As the main predator to <b>ringed</b> seals, the polar bear’s extinction in the coming years will allow for <b>ringed</b> seal populations to flourish. In the end, <b>ringed</b> seals are estimated to thrive with no polar bears present in the Arctic and Sub Arctic. Although this predator factor is involved with more recent research, it does not necessarily mean this will be the outcome, considering the uncertainty in such projections. Overall, <b>ringed</b> seals populations will fluctuate regardless of each potential outcome and climate change is certain to affect not only the <b>ringed</b> seal but all Arctic and Sub Arctic animal populations.|$|R
