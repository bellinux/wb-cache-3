5|$|Preventing Aβ {{aggregation}} is {{a promising}} method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a literature review article. In 2008, Folding@home simulated {{the dynamics of}} Aβ aggregation in atomic detail over timescales {{of the order of}} tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate Aβ folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> to identify a beta hairpin that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure. The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.|$|E
5|$|The FEFAP field surveys, {{excavations}} and exhumations spanned {{more than}} 10years. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> from King William Island and Beechey Island artefacts and human remains {{showed that the}} Beechey Island crew had most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, which was suggested by the evidence of Pott's disease discovered in Braine. Toxicological reports pointed to lead poisoning as a likely contributing factor. Blade cut marks found on bones {{from some of the}} crew were seen as signs of cannibalism. Evidence suggested that a combination of cold, starvation and disease including scurvy, pneumonia and tuberculosis, all made worse by lead poisoning, killed everyone in the Franklin party.|$|E
25|$|Family {{members may}} have a genetic {{tendency}} for stroke or share a lifestyle that contributes to stroke. Higher levels of Von Willebrand factor are more common amongst {{people who have had}} ischemic stroke for the first time. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> found that the only significant genetic factor was the person's blood type. Having had a stroke in the past greatly increases one's risk of future strokes.|$|E

25|$|While the {{majority}} of exposures {{have been shown to}} come through the diet, accidental ingestion can also be considered a source of exposure. One study conducted in Japan tested plastic baby books to look for possible leaching into saliva when babies chew on them. While the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> have yet to be replicated, it gives reason to question whether exposure can also occur in infants through ingestion by chewing on certain books or toys.|$|E
25|$|Rowntree {{investigated}} {{poverty in}} York, {{inspired by the}} work of his father Joseph Rowntree and the work of Charles Booth in London. He carried out a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working class home. This amounted to the detailed study of 11,560 families or 46,754 individuals. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> were published in 1901 in his book Poverty, A Study of Town Life.|$|E
25|$|Attempts to {{find its}} closest {{relatives}} have demonstrated with special clarity that molecular phylogenetics is not a sure-fire, problem-free method of determining systematic relationships. One study placed it in Saxifragales, but not at any particular position within that order. Doubts have been expressed about the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> Another study placed Cynomorium in Rosales based on analysis of the two invert repeat regions of the chloroplast genome, which evolve at one fifth {{the rate of the}} two single copy regions.|$|E

30|$|In {{a similar}} vein, the results {{revealed}} that input enhancement brought about improvements in the participants’ explicit knowledge of the target structures compared to the control group. The <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> demonstrated that enhanced input had positive and facilitative effect on improving explicit knowledge of target passive voice. The <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is in conflict with White (1998) and Erturk (2013) studies who found that input enhancement {{did not lead to}} the expected noticing of the target aspect in their studies.|$|R

25|$|The {{researchers}} found the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{to match their}} initial hypothesis that the gambler's fallacy could in fact be countered {{by the use of}} the hot hand and people's attention to the person who was actively flipping the coin. It {{is important to note that}} this counteraction of the gambler's fallacy only happened if the person tossing the coin remained the same. This study shed light on the idea that the gambler's and hot hand fallacies at times fight for dominance when people try to make predictions about the same event.|$|E
25|$|Between January 1992 and November 1994, 11 tigers were captured, {{fitted with}} radio-collars and {{monitored}} {{for more than}} 15 months in the eastern slopes of the Sikhote-Alin mountain range. <b>Results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> indicate that their distribution is closely associated with distribution of wapiti, while distribution of wild boar was not such a strong predictor for tiger distribution. Although they prey on both Siberian roe deer and sika deer, overlap of these ungulates with tigers was low. Distribution of moose was poorly associated with tiger distribution. The distribution of preferred habitat of key prey species was an accurate predictor of tiger distribution.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} shows that when music therapy is {{used in conjunction with}} traditional therapy, it improves rates of recovery and emotional and social deficits resulting from stroke. A study by Jeong & Kim examined the impact of music therapy when combined with traditional stroke therapy in a community-based rehabilitation program. Thirty-three stroke survivors were randomized into one of two groups: the experimental group, which combined rhythmic music and specialized rehabilitation movement for eight weeks; and a control group that sought and received traditional therapy. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> showed that participants in the experimental group gained not only more flexibility and wider range of motion, but an increased frequency and quality of social interactions and positive mood.|$|E
30|$|The <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{is similar}} with the {{findings}} of previous studies on adoption (Bekele and Drake 2003; Ketema and Bauer 2012; Guteta and Abegaz 2015 a).|$|R
30|$|Another <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is the {{demonstration}} of a no or negligible impact of OC on [tCho]. In fact, the median [tCho] observed in the OC group falls {{within the range of}} values obtained for the nOC group. This finding is in line with another <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> that is, the lack of a clear correlation between [tCho] and hormonal levels, apart from some sporadic correlations. In practice, OC impacts on the hormonal status but changes in hormonal levels do not produce significant variations in [tCho].|$|R

25|$|One {{study done}} by Simon Vermeier used neuroimaging to {{investigate}} serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 dogs with Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{to measure the}} serotonin 2A receptor availability. When compared to the 15 non-compulsive dogs used as a control group, the dogs with CCD {{were found to have}} lower receptor availability as well as lower subcortical perfusion and hypothalamic availability. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> provide evidence that there are imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in dogs. Similarities between other studies about human OCD provide construct validity for this study, which suggests that the research will be valid and useful in continuing to investigate brain activity and drug treatment in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{researchers}} from the School of Human Communication Sciences at La Trobe University in Bundoora, Victoria (Australia) noted that, after undergoing five voice therapy sessions targeted at lip spreading and forward tongue carriage, ten transfeminine individuals demonstrated a general increase in the formant frequency values F1, F2, and F3 {{as well as the}} fundamental frequency value F0. In increasing these frequency values, it was possible for these transfeminine individuals to more closely approximate the vocal frequency of cisgender women. The particular type of therapy used was oral resonance therapy, and the generally positive <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> suggest that it could be used for this purpose on a regular basis for those with the means and desire to increase the frequency of their voice.|$|E
25|$|The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{show that}} the {{earliest}} age at which children can discriminate well-formed from ill-formed sentences, as well as correct these, is at 6 years. During the critical period between 4 and 6 years old, {{there is a significant}} increase in the accuracy of grammaticality judgments, since metalinguistic skill is in critical development; the judgment relies on the psycholinguistic ability of the child to access their internalized grammar and to compute whether it can or cannot generate the target sentence. This ability to judge the grammaticality of sentences seems to develop in children well after basic grammar skills have been established, and is related to early reading acquisition—acquisitionists generally believe that the ability to make grammaticality judgments is a measure of syntactic awareness.|$|E

50|$|As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> five SNPs were {{obtained}} in four loci {{significantly associated with}} the disease, which {{may be related to}} the following genes: EXOC2, PVT1, NCOA1 and HLA-B.|$|R
25|$|The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{indicate}} that the taxi drivers' (experts') recall of streets was higher in both the route order condition and the map order condition than in the two random conditions. This indicates that the experts {{were able to use}} their prelearned spatial knowledge to organize the information {{in such a way that}} they surpassed STM and WM capacity limitations. The organization strategy that the drivers employed is known as chunking. Additionally, the comments made by the experts during the procedure point towards their use of route knowledge in completing the task. To ensure that it was in fact spatial information that they were encoding, the researchers also presented lists in alphabetical order and semantic categories. However, the researchers found that it was in fact spatial information that the experts were chunking, allowing them to surpass the limitations of both visuo-spatial STM and WM.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study of}} the Amerindian ancestry of Argentines was headed by Argentine {{geneticist}} Daniel Corach of the University of Buenos Aires. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> in which DNA from 320 individuals in 9 Argentine provinces was examined showed that 56% of these individuals {{had at least one}} Amerindian ancestor. Another study on African ancestry was also conducted by the University of Buenos Aires in the city of La Plata. In this study 4.3% of the 500 study participants were shown to have some degree of African ancestry. Nevertheless, it must be said here that this type of genetic studies -meant only to search for specific lineages in the mtDNA or in the Y-Chromosome, which do not recombine- may be misleading. For example, a person with seven European great-grandparents and only one Amerindian/Mestizo great-grandparent will be included in that 56%, although his/her phenotype will most probably be Caucasian.|$|E
500|$|A report {{published}} in June 2011, prepared by Ricardo {{in collaboration with}} experts from the UK's Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership, found that hybrid electric cars, plug-in hybrids and all-electric cars generate more carbon emissions during their production than current conventional vehicles, but still have a lower overall carbon footprint over the full life cycle. The higher carbon footprint during production of electric drive vehicles is due mainly {{to the production of}} batteries. As an example, 43 percent of production emissions for a mid-size electric car are generated from the battery production, while for standard mid-sized gasolineinternal combustion engine vehicle, around 75% of the embedded carbon emissions during production comes from the steel used in the vehicle glider.
