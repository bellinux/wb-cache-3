25|$|The United States Radium Corporation was a company, {{most notorious}} for its {{operations}} between the years 1917 to 1926 in Orange, New Jersey, in the United States {{that led to}} stronger worker protection laws. After initial success in developing a glow-in-the-dark <b>radioactive</b> <b>paint,</b> the company was subject to several lawsuits in the late 1920s {{in the wake of}} severe illnesses and deaths of workers (the Radium Girls) who had ingested radioactive material. The workers had been told that the paint was harmless. During World War I and World War II, the company produced luminous watches and gauges for the United States Army for use by soldiers.|$|E
50|$|Undark was a {{trade name}} for {{luminous}} paint {{made with a}} mixture of radioactive radium and zinc sulfide, as produced by the U.S. Radium Corporation between 1917 and 1938. It was used primarily in watch and clock dials. The people working in the industry who applied the <b>radioactive</b> <b>paint</b> became known as the Radium Girls, because many of them became ill and some died from exposure to the radiation emitted by the radium contained within the product. The product was the direct cause of Radium jaw in the dial painters. Undark was also available as a kit for general consumer use and marketed as glow-in-the-dark paint.|$|E
50|$|Her first position, in 1917, {{was with}} the Radium Luminous Material Corporation of Orange, New Jersey. Luckily she {{was not one of}} the Radium Girls, workers who became ill from {{exposure}} to <b>radioactive</b> <b>paints.</b> Wall's job was to chemically analyse ores and measure the concentration of radium extracted from them. Her reports made clear that chemists at the plant routinely used protective laboratory equipment and procedures which were not utilized by dial painters. She later testified and wrote about her work at the plant.|$|R
25|$|Clocks, watches, and {{instruments}} {{dating from the}} first half of the 20th century, often in military applications, may have been <b>painted</b> with <b>radioactive</b> luminous <b>paint.</b> They are usually no longer luminous; however, this is not due to radioactive decay of the radium (which has a half-life of 1600 years) but to the fluorescence of the zinc sulfide fluorescent medium being worn out by the radiation from the radium. The appearance of an often thick layer of green or yellowish brown paint in devices from this period suggests a radioactive hazard. The radiation dose from an intact device is relatively low and usually not an acute risk; but the paint is dangerous if released and inhaled or ingested.|$|R
50|$|Although old radium dials may {{no longer}} produce light, this is {{frequently}} due to {{the breakdown of the}} crystal structure of zinc sulfide rather than the radioactive decay of the radium, which has a half-life of about 1600 years, so even very old radium dials remain <b>radioactive.</b> Radium <b>paint</b> can be ingested by inhaling flaking paint particles. The alpha particles emitted by the radium, which is taken up in bone, will kill off surrounding bone tissue, resulting in a condition loosely referred to as radium jaw. Inhaled or ingested particles may deposit a high local dose with a risk of lung or gastrointestinal cancer due to the radiation dose. The risks are hard to quantify due to the variable levels of radium in the paint and the quantity ingested or inhaled. Care should be taken in handling these materials especially where the paint is damaged.|$|R
