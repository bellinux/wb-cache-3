5|$|When {{animals are}} faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the {{discounting}} of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging. Discounting can also be related to the <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivity</b> acts as a function of delay discounting. In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.|$|E

40|$|Measuring {{risks in}} asset {{portfolios}} {{has been one}} of the central topics in the financial industry. Since the introduction of coherent risk measures, studies on risk measurement have flourished and measures beyond value-at-risk, such as expected shortfall, have been adopted by academics and practitioners. However, the complexity of financial products makes it very difficult and time consuming to perform the numerical tasks necessary to compute these risk measures. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic kriging metamodelbased method for efficient estimation of <b>risks</b> and their <b>sensitivities.</b> In particular, this method uses gradient estimators of assets in a portfolio and gives the best linear unbiased predictor of the <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivities</b> with minimum mean squared error. Numerical comparisons of the proposed method with two other stochastic kriging based approaches demonstrate the promising role that the proposed method can play in the estimation of financial risk. ...|$|R

We analyzed a large panel of 784 deposit-taking institutions in Japan during the period from the 1992 financial year to the 2002 financial year. Our estimates indicate that depositors rightly appreciated the difference between healthy banks and risky banks, and that depositors of larger institutions are more sensitive to the bank risks than those of smaller institutions. We further argue that the estimated <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of depositors are large enough to discipline the deposit-taking institutions. Copyright 2009 The Authors.

The optimal wholesale price of one supplier is first increasing and then decreasing with the <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the two retailers if the substitutability is sufficiently low, otherwise decreasing with the <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The expected equilibrium order quantity of one retailer is often increasing with his <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> We also study the effects of the wholesale prices and the service investment efficiencies on the retail price-service level decisions of the retailers.

40|$|Hedging {{methods to}} {{mitigate}} the exposure of variable annuity products to market risks require the calculation of market <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivities</b> (or "Greeks"). The complex, path-dependent nature of these products means these sensitivities typically must be estimated by Monte Carlo simulation.

As well as requiring multiple valuations, such approaches can be unreliable for higher order Greeks, e. g., gamma. In this article we investigate alternative estimators implemented within an advanced economic scenario generator model, incorporating stochastic interest-rates and stochastic equity volatility.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{usefulness}} of screening for risk factors, we derived arithmetic relationships between screening parameters (sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value PPV) and risk factor frequency, disease frequency and relative risk. We evaluated these relationships in the special case of genetic markers and disease susceptibility. It can be shown {{that even in the}} face of very large relative <b>risks,</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and positive predictive value are affected by the relative magnitude of disease and genetic marker frequencies. When the genetic marker is less frequent than the disease, PPV increases with increasing relative <b>risk</b> but <b>sensitivity</b> remains low. When the genetic marker is more frequent than the disease, sensitivity increases with increasing relative risk but PPV remains low. When marker and disease frequencies are equal, both PPV and sensitivity increase with increasing relative risks, but very high relative risks (greater than 100) have to be obtained for rare diseases. Depending on the goals of the screening program, these relationships can be used to predict the relative magnitudes of false positives (low PPV) and false negatives (low sensitivity). This approach can be generalized to evaluate nongenetic risk factors in screening programs as well...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{vertical}} {{variations in}} ocean circulation, larval Northeast Arctic cod Gadus morhua may influence their own drift routes by migrating vertically. By coupling a larval individual-based model {{and a general}} circulation model, we simulated larval vertical positioning according to simple rules based on individual <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> This enabled us to investigate how larval growth, survival and horizontal distribution vary between individuals following different rules. Immediate depth selection follows from the rules, with implications for environmental exposure and instantaneous growth rates. The behavioural rules had long-term and large-scale consequences, since vertical positioning influences the drift trajectory of the larva, and thereby the physical environment the larva experiences along its way. Two alternative rule formulations were explored, each containing {{the full range of}} strategies, from maximising immediate growth to maximising immediate survival. Fitness was defined as accumulated survival probability up to 18 mm for larvae released at 2 important spawning grounds in the Lofoten area. Both rules gave better fitness than for individuals drifting at fixed depths. The most successful individuals performed active vertical migration and had an intermediate <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> When <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was allowed to change with ontogeny, larvae that first emphasised growth and then changed to intermediate <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivity</b> were the most successful ones, although improvements were minor compared to fixed sensitivities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple yet powerful simulation-based approach for approximating {{the values of}} prices and Greeks (ie, derivatives {{with respect to the}} underlying spot prices, such as delta, gamma, etc) for American-style options. This approach is primarily based upon the least squares Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm and is thus termed the modified LSM (MLSM) algorithm. The key to this approach is that with initial asset prices randomly generated from a carefully chosen distribution, we obtain a regression equation for the initial value function, which can be differentiated analytically to generate estimates for the Greeks. Our approach is intuitive, easy to apply, computationally efficient and, most importantly, provides a unified framework for estimating <b>risk</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the option price to underlying spot prices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique with a series of increasingly complex but realistic examples. ...|$|R

Consistent with the earlier results, we report that the time variation in risk premium accounts for most of the predictability. However, the results also show a sizable positive interaction between the beta and the risk premium which seems to increase for smaller companies. ...|$|R
