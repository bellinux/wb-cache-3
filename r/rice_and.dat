5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the ruff’s diet consists almost exclusively {{of the adults}} and larva of terrestrial and aquatic insects such as beetles and flies.

Migrating birds in Italy varied their diet according to what was available at each stopover site. Green aquatic plant material, spilt <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> maize, flies and beetles were found, along with varying amounts of grit. On the main wintering grounds in West Africa, rice is a favoured food during the later part of the season as the ricefields dry out.|$|E

5|$|In China, <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> millet were domesticated by 8,000 BC, {{followed}} by mung, soy and azuki beans.

In New Guinea, ancient Papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around 7,000 BC, domesticating sugarcane and taro. In the Indus Valley from the eighth millennium BC onwards at Mehrgarh, 2-row and 6-row barley were cultivated, along with einkorn, emmer, and durum wheats, and dates. In the earliest levels of Merhgarh, wild game such as gazelle, swamp deer, blackbuck, chital, wild ass, wild goat, wild sheep, boar, and nilgai were all hunted for food. These are successively replaced by domesticated sheep, goats, and humped zebu cattle {{by the fifth}} millennium BC, indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.|$|E

The paper also investigated the physical characteristic of local sand, <b>rice</b> hull <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> hull ash as filter media for water treatment, to investigate the filtration performance or features of local sands, <b>rice</b> hull <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> hull ash, and; to compare the filtration features of these three materials with existing standards [...] The abilities of the local sand, <b>rice</b> hull ash <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> hull to remove turbidity are found to be 21 %, 58 % and 53 %, while E.

But for the local sand both the turbidity and E. coli removal rates were 58 % and 65 % respectively. Significant difference was established among these three materials using one way ANOVA at 95 % confidence level. A further statistical analysis using least Square Deviation (LSD) and Dunnett statistic indicates that there is no significant difference in performance between <b>rice</b> hull <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> hull ask, except between local sand and the other filter media considered...|$|R
