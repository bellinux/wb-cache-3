40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the enhancement of the visual feedback for the teleoperator of an all-terrain fast mobile robot. Indeed, remote control trials have shown inferior mobility performances (as speed, accuracy) in relation to direct driving of the same vehicles. Our goal of improving these performances for an operational application needs notably an better visual perception. This article deals with the first step of this goal. Studies showed notably that the teleoperator needs a large field of view. We decide {{to take advantage of the}} <b>rough</b> <b>movement</b> of the camera induced by the robot motion on unstructured ground. We use this environment sweep of the camera to dynamically build an image mosaic which is a way for extending the operator field of view using one camera. The image mosaic is made of the successive video images aligned together to display an coherent and stable environment in spite of the camera motion. The correct alignement is realized using an iterative multiresolution method and points of interest matching. - to reduce the data rate involved between the robot and the control-and-command station,- to reduce costs by using shelf equipment in exploiting at the best their resources,- the robot moves in an all-terrain unstructured environment, which induces a <b>rough</b> <b>movement</b> of the camera. The result of this visual feedback to the operator can be a loss of spatial orientation and motion sickness, wich deteriorates performance even more. According to the foregoing, this first approach consists in exploiting one camera and taking advantage of the camera movement induced by the robot motion on allterrain ground. The camera field of view which scans the environment will be used to extend the field of view displayed to the teleoperator by dynamically compiling an image mosaic. This latter will consist of all the images broadcasted by the robot which are arranged in a coincident way so as to display a coherent environment. ...|$|R

40|$|Three {{advanced}} natural interaction modalities for {{mobile robot}} guidance in an indoor environment were developed and compared using two tasks and quantitative metrics to measure performance and workload. The first interaction modality {{is based on}} direct physical interaction requiring the human user to push the robot in order to displace it. The second and third interaction modalities exploit a 3 -D vision-based human-skeleton tracking allowing the user to guide the robot by either walking {{in front of it}} or by pointing toward a desired location. In the first task, {{the participants were asked to}} guide the robot between different rooms in a simulated physical apartment requiring <b>rough</b> <b>movement</b> of the robot through designated areas. The second task evaluated robot guidance in the same environment through a set of waypoints, which required accurate movements. The three interaction modalities were implemented on a generic differential drive mobile platform equipped with a pan-tilt system and a Kinect camera. Task completion time and accuracy were used as metrics to assess the users' performance, while the NASA-TLX questionnaire was used to evaluate the users' workload. A study with 24 participants indicated that choice of interaction modality had significant effect on completion time (F(2, 61) = 84. 874, p < 0. 001), accuracy (F(2, 29) = 4. 937, p = 0. 016), and workload (F(2, 68) = 11. 948, p < 0. 001). The direct physical interaction required less time, provided more accuracy and less workload than the two contactless interaction modalities. Between the two contactless interaction modalities, the person-following interaction modality was systematically better than the pointing-control one: The participants completed the tasks faster with less workload.

40|$|This article {{describes}} a class project of cyber-driver, i. e. an android robot controlling a mobile platform. This project {{can be used}} both to teach high-school students in programming, hardware design and foundations of robotic science by solving some important and scientifically interesting tasks. Despite the great number of modern android robotics systems, their software controlling systems often have serious issues. Such actions as <b>rough</b> terrain <b>movement</b> or stairs climbing can be performed simply and accurately by both humans and animals but not by biosimilar robots. The traditional systems in these cases demand many complex and precise settings to perform such movements and nevertheless they remain very vulnerable to random factors. In robotic perception models the situation is similar: casual human tasks as image recognition or scene analysis need complex algorithms and huge computer resources if performed by robots. Biologically-inspired models can improve matters in robotic science. Human movement copying is often used for solving this problem in practice {{but it does not}} allow copying considerable aspects of movement controlling in nervous system. Both controlling quality and testing quality for the aforementioned tasks can be essentially improved if the robot uses techniques similar to central motor programs of human. This project helps students to study this important domain. Besides, robotic perception can imitate biological systems more closely. Such biologically-inspired perception models give structure to computer vision systems and allow developing these systems quicker. The cyber-driver project is an example of biologically-inspired educational system. The system proposed consists of android robot that can manipulate levers, wheels and buttons, and mobile robotic platform. Educational robotic platform YARP- 3 allows easy modification of constructing arms and grippers encouraging students’ creativity. The software of the robot can automatically perform some of the driver’s tasks (indicators recognition, obstacle avoiding and movement without collisions). The project uses some key features of robotic science, which are interdisciplinarity and competitive spirit, to improve students’ experience. The project’s architecture allows modifications in both mathematical and practical aspects of the result system’s description. Besides that, some extra suggestions about project-based inquiry in robotics are made.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Dislocation of the {{proximal}} tibiofibular joint {{is a rare}} injury. It occurs during a sports activity that includes <b>rough</b> twisting <b>movements</b> of the bent knee. The role of {{the proximal}} tibiofibular joint is to reduce torsional loads to the ankle, to distribute the bending moment of the outer side of tibia, and transfer the vertical load while standing. In the literature there is no larger series; only several cases of the proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation treated by different methods have been published so far. Case Report. A 23 -year-old male soccer player sustained an injury after he had joined the game without previous warming-up. He fell on his right side because of a sudden change of direction while his foot was fixed to the base. He felt a severe pain and had a sensation as if something had snapped in his right knee. Pain and swelling {{at the head of}} fibula were found by physical examination, which, however, did not reveal any pain, swelling and instability of the ankle or peroneal nerve palsy. The x-ray showed anterolateral dislocation of the proximal tibiofibular joint, Ogden type II. Since manual reposition in general anesthesia failed, open reduction internal fixation was performed and proximal tibiofibular joint was transfixed with a screw. After the wound closure, the above-the-knee plaster cast was applied. The screw was extracted six weeks later, full weight bearing was allowed and he started with physical therapy. Four months after the injury he returned to sports activities. On the follow- up one year after the injury he had the full range of motion of the knee, no complains, and continued with active soccer playing. X-ray showed no signs of arthrosis of the proximal tibiofibular joint. Conclusion. The proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation may be the cause of the chronic pain of the knee so it has {{to be taken into account}} when making differential diagnosis in case of the pain at the lateral side of the knee. The key for making the accurate diagnosis is the technically correct X-ray of the injured knee compared with the opposite one, showing the displacement of fibular head. If manual reposition fails, open reduction internal fixation and screw transfixation of the proximal tibiofibular joint allow good results and fast return to sport activities...|$|R
30|$|Remote-controlled mobile robots {{are useful}} for searching around and inside {{buildings}} that have collapsed in a disaster. In a disaster area, to avoid the risk of secondary disasters, it is preferable to immediately deploy remote-controlled mobile robots {{instead of waiting for}} first responders such as firefighters. Disaster response robots should have high mobility on <b>rough</b> terrain. The <b>movement</b> mechanism of a crawler-type robot with sub-crawlers has been applied to many disaster response robots in order to realize high mobility [1]. However, its use complicates robot operation because the operator must actively control each sub-crawler by estimating the attitude or state of the robot based on camera images and sensor information. Therefore, because of the multiple degrees of freedom involved, operators must be well trained to achieve high mobility by using remote control. A semi-autonomous control system for crawler robots has been studied to realize both high mobility and simple operation [2],[3]. This study focused on a crawler robot with passive sub-crawlers to realize simple operation with multiple degrees of freedom. Passive sub-crawlers can adapt to unknown rough terrain. We developed a crawler-type mobile robot for conducting search operations around a disaster area. Passive sub-crawlers called “Scotta I” were adopted for this robot. In a crawler robot with passive sub-crawlers, it is only necessary to control the movement direction and driving speed, unlike in the case of controlling active sub-crawlers. However, posture control is impossible in passive sub-crawlers because the operator cannot actively control each sub-crawler, and a robot with passive sub-crawlers cannot recover from a situation in which it is stuck. A robot with passive sub-crawlers is extremely simple, but it is essential for the operator to possess considerable skill when selecting a route. The operator must select a traversable route for unknown rough terrain using only the information obtained from camera images and sensor data from the robot.|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} human–animal {{interactions}} {{is an important}} factor contributing to animal welfare and productivity. Reducing stress during routine husbandry procedures is likely to improve animal welfare. We examined how the type of early handling of calves affected responses to two common husbandry procedures, ear-tagging and disbudding. Forty Holstein–Friesian calves (n = 20 /treatment) were exposed to one of two handling treatments daily from 1 to 5 weeks of age: (1) positive (n = 20), involving gentle handling (soft voices, slow movements, patting), and (2) negative (n = 20), involving rough handling (<b>rough</b> voices, rapid <b>movements,</b> pushing). Heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) and behaviour (activity, tail flicking) were measured before and after ear-tagging and disbudding (2 days apart). Cortisol was measured at − 20 (baseline), 20 and 40 min relative to disbudding time. There were no significant treatment differences in HR, RR or behaviour in response to either procedure. However, the following changes occurred across both treatment groups. HR increased after disbudding (by 14. 7 ± 4. 0 and 18. 6 ± 3. 8 bpm, positive and negative, respectively; mean ± s. e. m.) and ear-tagging (by 8. 7 ± 3. 1 and 10. 3 ± 3. 0 bpm, positive and negative, respectively). After disbudding, there was an increase in RR (by 8. 2 ± 3. 4 and 9. 3 ± 3. 4 breaths/min, positive and negative, respectively), overall activity (by 9. 4 ± 1. 2 and 9. 9 ± 1. 3 frequency/min, positive and negative, respectively) and tail flicking (by 13. 2 ± 2. 8 and 11. 2 ± 3. 0 frequency/min, positive and negative, respectively), and cortisol increased from baseline at 20 min post procedure (by 10. 3 ± 1. 1 and 12. 3 ± 1. 1 nmol/l positive and negative, respectively). Although we recorded significant changes in calf responses during ear-tagging and disbudding, the type of prior handling had no effect on responses. The effects of handling may have been overridden by the degree of pain and/or stress associated with the procedures. Further research is warranted to understand the welfare impact and interaction between previous handling and responses to husbandry procedures...|$|R
