5|$|The {{remedies}} {{available in}} Singapore administrative law are the prerogative orders – the mandatory order (formerly known as mandamus), prohibiting order (prohibition), quashing order (certiorari), and order for review of detention (habeas corpus) – and the declaration, {{a form of}} equitable remedy. In Singapore, administrative law is the branch of law that enables a person to challenge an exercise of power by {{the executive branch of}} the Government. The challenge is carried out by applying to the High Court for judicial review. The Court's power to <b>review</b> <b>a</b> law or an official act of a government official is part of its supervisory jurisdiction, and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade.|$|E
5|$|The speech made Breckinridge {{a target}} of Whigs, Young Americans, and Douglas supporters. Humphrey Marshall, a Kentucky Whig who {{supported}} incumbent President Millard Fillmore, attacked Breckinridge for claiming Fillmore had not fully disclosed his views on slavery. Illinois' William Alexander Richardson, a Douglas backer, tried to distance Douglas from Sanders' attacks on Butler, but Breckinridge showed that Douglas endorsed the Democratic <b>Review</b> <b>a</b> month after it printed its first anti-Butler article. Finally, Breckinridge's cousin, California's Edward C. Marshall, charged that Butler would name Breckinridge Attorney General {{in exchange for his}} support and revived the charge that Breckinridge broke party ranks, supporting Zachary Taylor for president. Breckinridge ably defended himself, but Sanders continued to attack him and Butler, claiming Butler would name Breckinridge as his running mate, even though Breckinridge was too young to qualify as vice president.|$|E

Hall's performance."; Season five has 100% positive <b>reviews,</b> <b>a</b> score of 7.5 out of 10, and the consensus: [...] "Dexter continues to improve as it enters its fifth season, successfully blending dark, gory intrigue with enough character development to keep things interesting."; Season six has 54% positive <b>reviews,</b> <b>a</b> score of 6.8 out of 10, and the consensus: [...] "Dexter's sixth season certainly retreads well-worn themes, but Michael C. Hall's sly, cheeky performance is worth sticking around for."; Season seven has 80% positive <b>reviews,</b> <b>a</b> score of 7.8 out of 10, and the consensus: [...] "Season seven represents a return to form for Dexter, characterized by a riveting storyline {{and a willingness to}} take some risks."; Season eight has 60% positive <b>reviews,</b> <b>a</b> score of 6.5 out of 10, and the final consensus: [...] "In its final season, Dexter holds on to much of season seven's momentum and finishes on a strong note, even if the inevitable conclusion feels somewhat anticlimactic." ...|$|R

Fearful that the work might be challenged as defamatory or not in the public domain, Houston Grand Opera obtained insurance to cover such an eventuality. Before its stage premiere, the opera was presented in concert form in May 1987 in San Francisco, with intermission discussions led by Adams.

5|$|Eldred did {{not have}} a troop board of <b>review,</b> <b>a</b> review by the adult troop leaders to ensure eligibility. Instead, Eldred had a {{thorough}} National Board of Review consisting of West, Baden-Powell, Ernest Thompson Seton, Daniel Carter Beard, Arthur R. Forbush, and Wilbert E. Longfellow, who wrote in the Handbook for Boys on life-saving and swimming. At the time there had still not been a council-level system for Eagle Scouts boards of review. Largely due to delays caused by Baden-Powell's visit, the National Court of Honor did not convene until March 29, 1912. A press announcement was released on or about April 10, 1912, leading to a century of confusion wherein it was believed Eldred's Board of Review had been held in April. West informed Eldred of his Eagle award in a letter dated August 21, 1912. Another reason for the delays was that the Boy Scouts of America felt no one would ever earn the Eagle Scout award and at the time of Eldred's Board of Review, the Eagle Scout medal had not yet been designed. This letter also informed Eldred of the delay in the medal, caused {{by the fact that the}} design of the Eagle Scout medal had not been finalized. Eldred was presented Eagle Scout on Labor Day, September 2, 1912, becoming the first to earn Scouting's highest rank, just two years after the founding of the BSA itself.|$|E
