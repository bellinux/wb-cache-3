5|$|The current {{economic}} climate {{in the country}} has affected many Icelandic businesses and citizens. With the creation of Nýi Landsbanki, the new organisation which replaces the old Landsbanki, around 300 employees will lose their jobs due to a radical restructuring of the organisation which is intended to minimise the bank's international operations. Similar job losses are expected at Glitnir and Kaupthing The job losses can {{be compared with the}} 2,136 <b>registered</b> <b>unemployed</b> and 495 advertised vacancies in Iceland at the end of August 2008.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 AFFCO {{closed the}} Waitara {{works with the}} {{consequent}} severe loss of employment in the town. The shutdown followed the closure of a Swanndri clothing factory, a small-scale but locally significant Subaru car assembly plant and a wool scouring plant. The number of <b>registered</b> <b>unemployed</b> in the town rose from 700 to 1000, helping to boost the unemployment rate for the Taranaki region, which includes New Plymouth and Waitara, to 9.8 percent, compared with {{the national average of}} 6.7 percent.|$|E
25|$|Müller’s SPD {{government}} eventually fell as {{a result}} of the catastrophic effects of the Great Depression. Müller’s government, an ideologically diverse “Grand Coalition” representing five parties ranging from the left to the right, was unable to develop effective counter-measures to tackle the catastrophic effects of the economic crisis, as characterised by the massive rise in the numbers of <b>registered</b> <b>unemployed.</b> In 1928–29, 2.5million were estimated to be unemployed, a figure that reached over 3million by the following winter. A major problem facing Müller’s government was a deficit in the Reich budget, which the government spending more than it was receiving. This situation was made worse by the inadequacy of the unemployment scheme which was unable to pay out enough benefits to the rising numbers of unemployed, forcing the government to make contributions to the scheme (which in turn worsened the budget deficit). The coalition was badly divided on this issue, with the SPD wishing to raise the level of contributions to the scheme while safeguarding both those in work and those out of work as much as possible. The right-wing parties, by contrast, wished to reduce unemployment benefits while lightening the tax burden. Unable to garner enough support in the Reichstag to pass laws, Müller turned to Hindenburg for support, wishing him to grant him the use of the emergency powers under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution so that he did not have to rely on support from the Reichstag.|$|E
30|$|Insured {{people who}} are <b>registered</b> as <b>unemployed</b> and who have been insured for at least 12  months during the 36  months (until 2006, during 24  months) prior to <b>registering</b> as <b>unemployed,</b> {{have the right to}} receive {{unemployment}} insurance benefits. The amount of benefit paid depends on the recipient’s previous salary and it decreases the longer the unemployment spell lasts (Health, Labour… 2008).|$|R
50|$|Pôle emploi (in English {{employment}} centre) is a French {{governmental agency}} which <b>registers</b> <b>unemployed</b> people, helps them find jobs and {{provides them with}} financial aid. The agency was created in 2009, resulting from the merger between the ANPE and the UNEDIC (or Unédic). The agency employs 45,000 civil servants. The merger had been expected {{for a very long}} time, for the two agencies had been created more than forty years before.|$|R
30|$|The {{process of}} <b>registering</b> as <b>unemployed</b> is quite {{complicated}} {{in terms of}} the legislation and social guarantees for unemployment 2, and the level of unemployment allowances is very low.|$|R
2500|$|To get {{unemployment}} benefits in Poland, {{one has to}} register with the appropriate government office and demonstrate [...] "the lack of the possibility to be employed or to be professionally activated {{within the field of}} activities proposed by the said office, have worked for a total of at least 365 days in the period of 18 months before registering with the said government office." [...] In March 2014 it was reported that 13.6% of the <b>registered</b> <b>unemployed</b> were eligible for the {{unemployment benefits}}.|$|E
2500|$|Cluj has, after Bucharest, {{the largest}} number of {{companies}} in the country (over 32,000 firms in 2014) and ranks third after net average earning, with 1,890 lei in December 2013 (Bucharest has 2,474 lei, and Ilfov 2,138 lei); it is almost 5% higher than the national average. Great investors in automotive industry, but also in IT have increased the average salary of employees, but these wage increases have led to an increase in the cost of living, reflected, for example, through higher rents than in surrounding counties. In Cluj companies work over 150,000 people, and after their turnover, the county ranks fifth in the Romanian business hierarchy, with €8 billion in 2012, after Bucharest (€81.9 billion), Ilfov (€13.6 billion), Argeș (€9.1 billion) and Timiș (€8.7 billion). The number of <b>registered</b> <b>unemployed</b> at the end of June 2014 was 9,744 people, and the unemployment rate, calculated on the working population, is 2.8%, being 0.6% lower than the unemployment rate in June 2013. In 2015, GDP per capita is +30% more than national average.|$|E
2500|$|Unemployment {{originated}} in Poland {{in the late}} 19th century, and appeared {{as a result of}} industrialization. In Russian-ruled Congress Poland, the 1904 onset of war with Japan caused a depression that deepened with the following year's revolution. Meanwhile, efforts by the government to shift industry to Russia proper led to long-term industrial recession. Massive unemployment of factory workers ensued, in turn prompting both urban and rural Poles to emigrate. In the Second Polish Republic (1918–1939), unemployment was among the worst problems of the economy, particularly during the Great Depression (1929–1934). The number of <b>registered</b> <b>unemployed</b> jumped from 185,000 in 1928 to 466,000 in 1936; in 1932, there were 240,000 unemployed industrial workers, or one-third of the total in that field. Not only industrial workers but also members of the intelligentsia were affected. Official statistics for the period only account for non-farm wage and salary earners who registered as unemployed with a labor exchange. Thus, government data account for just part of the actual number of jobless. One scholar calculated a non-farm wage-earner unemployment rate of 13% for 1929 and 25% for 1931, estimating a [...] "substantially higher" [...] figure for 1938, given natural increase in the urban population and migration from rural areas.|$|E
50|$|In November 2008, the {{official}} unemployment rate increased by 0.4 percent to 2.3 (Previously 1.9% in September), the State Statistics Committee {{said that as}} of December 1 (2008), it <b>registered</b> 640,000 <b>unemployed</b> people.|$|R

2500|$|Mair {{extensively}} reshuffled his cabinet, {{announcing the}} new ministry on 16 August. Among the appointments included Athol Richardson as Colonial Treasurer, Lewis Martin took up Spooner's former roles of Public Works and Local Government {{and the relatively}} new Vernon Treatt as Minister for Justice. Faced {{with a population of}} 53,000 <b>registered</b> <b>unemployed,</b> on 30 August Mair made plans to combat youth unemployment by providing generous pension schemes for coalminers and introducing compulsory retirement at age 60, thereby halving the unemployment rate. Despite attempts to reassure business speculation over the outbreak of war, on 3 September 1939 the Second World War erupted. At the cabinet meeting the next day, Mair, both of his sons having enlisted, reaffirmed the need to support Britain and the Allies. Mair personally also took on this responsibility by contributing £4000 in war loans. In December, Mair's Government refused to register refugee German doctors and Mair later criticised Prime Minister Robert Menzies for not acting to [...] intern enemy aliens. When Parliament returned in March 1940, the Opposition Leader, William McKell, moved a censure motion on the government, citing its ineffectiveness to act on unemployment and housing. Mair responded by tearing apart their arguments in a one-hour and a half long speech.|$|E
