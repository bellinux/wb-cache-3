50|$|The <b>rex</b> <b>sole,</b> Glyptocephalus zachirus, is a {{flatfish}} of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. Locally, {{it may also be}} known as a witch or threadfin sole (due to the filamentous pelvic fin on the eyed surface). It is a demersal fish that lives in temperate waters on sand or mud bottoms at depths of up to 900 m, though it is most commonly found between 61 and 500 m. Its native habitat is the northern Pacific, from Baja California in Mexico up the coasts of the United States, British Columbia and Alaska, across the Bering Sea to the coast of Russia and the Sea of Japan. It is slow-growing, reaching up to 60 cm in length (though its average length is 36 cm), and it can weigh up to 2.0 kg. Maximum reported lifespan is 24 years.|$|E

25|$|As {{the event}} {{took place during}} the revolutionary period, it was quite {{difficult}} to make out who the perpetrator(s) was (were), making ill-conceived accusations rather prevalent. Many elements of the revolutionary bloc laid blame on Mohammad Reza Shah, the now deposed monarch of Iran, and SAVAK (Sazeman-e Ettelaat va Amniyat-e Keshvar), the country’s domestic security and intelligence service. Although sufficient evidence was never brought forth to facilitate such claims, the labeling would have far-reaching implications on the subsequent direction of the revolutionary movement. The circumstances in which the fire was set did not aid in the shah’s pleas of innocence either. The timing and the location of the incident (an impoverished district of Abadan) did not coincide with preceding patterns of protestation, which raised the level of suspicion. It was also believed that the shah specifically targeted Cinema <b>Rex</b> for the <b>sole</b> purpose of killing political dissidents who had gathered to watch a controversial anti-government film called Gavaznha (The Deer) starring well-known actor Behrouz Vossoughi.|$|R
40|$|We examine {{patterns}} of occurrence of associated dinosaur specimens (n = 343) from the North American Upper Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation and equivalent beds, by comparing their relative abundance in sandstone and mudstone. Ceratopsians preferentially occur in mudstone, whereas hadrosaurs {{and the small}} ornithopod Thescelosaurus show a strong association with sandstone. By contrast, the giant carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex shows no preferred association with either lithology. These lithologies are used {{as an indicator of}} environment of deposition, with sandstone generally representing river environments, and finer grained sediments typically representing floodplain environments. Given these {{patterns of}} occurrence, we argue that spatial niche partitioning helped reduce competition for resources between the herbivorous dinosaurs. Within coastal lowlands ceratopsians preferred habitats farther away from rivers, whereas hadrosaurs and Thescelosaurus preferred habitats in close proximity to rivers, and T. <b>rex,</b> the ecosystem's <b>sole</b> large carnivore, inhabited both palaeoenvironments. Spatial partitioning of the environment helps explain how several species of large herbivorous dinosaurs coexisted. This study emphasizes that different lithologies can preserve dramatically dissimilar vertebrate assemblages, even when deposited in close proximity and within a narrow window of time. The lithology in which fossils are preserved should be recorded as these data can provide unique insights into the palaeoecology of the animals they preserve...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rex</b> <b>sole</b> (Glyptocephalus zachirus) {{have a wide}} {{distribution}} throughout the North Pacific, ranging from central Baja California to the western Bering Sea. Although <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> are an important species in the commercial trawl fisheries off the U. S. West Coast, knowledge of their reproductive biology is limited to one study off the Oregon coast where ovaries were analyzed with gross anatomical methods. This study was initiated to determine reproductive and growth parameters specific to <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) stock. Female <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> (n= 594) ranging in total length from 166 to 552 mm were collected opportunistically around Kodiak Island, Alaska, from February 2000 to October 2001. All ovaries were analyzed by using standard histological criteria to determine the maturity stage. Year-round sampling of <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> ovaries confirmed that <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> are batch spawners and have a protracted spawning season in the GOA that lasts at least eight months, from October to May; {{the duration of the}} spawning season and the months of spawning activity are different from those previously estimated. Female <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> in the GOA had an estimated length at 50 % maturity (ML 50) of 352 mm, which is greater than the previously estimated ML 50 at southern latitudes. The maximum age of collected female <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> was 29 years, and the estimated age at 50 % maturity (MA 50) in the GOA was 5. 1 years. The von Bertalanffy growth model for <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> in the GOA was significantly different from the previously estimated model for <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> off the Oregon coast. This study indicated that there are higher growth rates for <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> in the GOA than off the Oregon coast and that there are differences in length at maturity and similarity in age at maturity between the two regions...|$|E

40|$|Whole-gear {{efficiency}} (the {{proportion of}} fish passing between the otter doors of a bottom trawl that are subsequently captured) was estimated from data collected during experiments {{to measure the}} herding efficiency of bridles and doors, the capture efficiency of the net, {{and the length of}} the bridles sufficiently close to the seafloor to elicit a herding response. The experiments were focused on four species of flatfish: arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon), <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> (Glyptocephalus zachirus), and Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). Whole-gear efficiency varied with fish length and reached maximum values between 40 % and 50 % for arrowtooth flounder, flathead sole, and <b>rex</b> <b>sole.</b> For Dover sole, however, whole-gear efficiency declined from a maximum of 33 % over the length range sampled. Such efficiency estimates can be used to determine catchability, which, in turn, can be used to improve the accuracy of stock assessment models when the time series of a survey is short...|$|E
40|$|We compare {{results of}} bottom trawl surveys off Washington, Oregon, and California in 1977, 1980, 1983, and 1986 to discern trends in {{population}} abundance, distribution, and biology. Catch {{per unit of}} effort, area-swept biomass estimates, and age and length compositions for 12 commercially important west coast groundfishes are presented to illustrate trends over the lO-year period. We discuss the precision, accuracy, and statistical significance of observed trends in abundance estimates. The influence of water temperature {{on the distribution of}} groundfishes is also briefly examined. Abundance estimates of canary rockfish, Sebastes pinniger, and yellowtail rockfish, S. Jlavidus, declined during the study period; greater declines were observed in Pacific ocean perch, S. alutus, lingcod, Ophiodon elongatus, and arrowtooth flounder, Atheresthes stomias. Biomass estimates of Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, and English, <b>rex,</b> and Dover <b>soles</b> (Pleuronectes vetulus, Errex zachirus, and Microstomus pacificus) increased, while bocaccio, S. paucispinis, and chilipepper, S. goodei, were stable. Sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, biomass estimates increased markedly from 1977 to 1980 and declined moderately thereafter. Precision was lowest for rockfishes, lingcod, and sablefish; it was highest for flatfishes because they were uniformly distributed. The accuracy of survey estimates could be gauged only for yellowtail and canary rockfish and sablefish. All fishery-based analyses produced much larger estimates of abundance than bottom trawl surveys-indicative of the true catchability of survey trawls. Population trends from all analyses compared well except in canary rockfish, the species that presents the greatest challenge to obtaining reasonable precision and one that casts doubts on the usefulness of bottom trawl surveys for estimating its abundance.

The grate was located ahead of the trawl codend to direct halibut toward an escape opening while allowing target species to pass through toward the codend. In an experimental fishery, the escape rate of halibut was estimated at 94 %, while 72 % of the Dover sole, Microstomas pacificus, 67 % of the <b>rex</b> <b>sole,</b> Glyptocephalus zachirus, and 79 % of the flathead sole, Hippoglossoides elassodon, were retained...|$|E
40|$|Reprinted from Fishery bulletin, Vol. 75 (1), pages 173 - 183. Dover and <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> larvae attain an {{exceptionally}} large size {{and have a}} long pelagic life. Dover sole larvae (9 - 65 mm standard length) were collected in mid-water trawls and plankton nets during all months of the year. Judging from growth of larvae and occurrence in bottom trawls of recently metamorphosed juveniles, Dover sole are pelagic during {{their first year of}} life. Large larvae (50 - 65 mm standard length) are probably pelagic for over a year and few apparently are recruited to benthic populations. Dover sole larvae were most common in oceanic waters beyond the continental slope and in the upper 50 m of the water column. The <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> larvae captured were 5 - 89 mm long. Average size and stage of development of larvae increased from March through February, and juveniles were common on the bottom during winter on the outer shelf. Thus the pelagic phase usually lasts about a year. Both rex and Dover sole may utilize the outer continental shelf-upper slope region for a nursery during early benthic life. Petrale sole larvae (10 - 22 mm standard length) were rare. They were collected only from March to June and appear to have a pelagic life of about 6 mo. Age-group 0 juveniles, uncommon in bottom trawl collections, were only captured on the inner continental shelf in the fall...|$|E
40|$|We report Phrixocephalus cincinnatus, a pennellid copepod infecting {{the eyes}} of flatfishes, from a single {{specimen}} of <b>rex</b> <b>sole,</b> Glyptocephalus zachirus, for the first time. In the typical host, the arrowtooth flounder, Atherestes stomias, the parasite occurred commonly in sampled populations from the Broughton Archipelago in British Columbia, infected primarily the right eye of the flounder, and on only one occasion presented more than two parasites per eye. The copepod attached to the choroid layer and ramified throughout the posterior compartment of the eye, resulting in the disruption of the retina and probably impairing host vision. Inflammation and hyperplasia progressed to necrosis and proliferation of connective tissue, resulting in the total destruction of the eye...|$|E

The feeding {{habits of}} the Dover sole and <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> (mainly juveniles) and of slender sole and Pacific sanddab were {{investigated}} at seven stations on the continental shelf off central Oregon. Dover sole had a catholic diet, feeding on a large variety of infaunal and epifaunal invertebrates. The composition of the diet varied among stations of different depth and sediment type indicating opportunistic feeding. Pelecypoda {{were the most important}} prey on a weight basis at the shallow station (74 m) of well-sorted sand where they were the dominant macrofaunal invertebrate.

40|$|Information is {{summarized}} on juvenile salmonid distribution, size, condition, growth, stock origin, {{and species}} and environmental associations from June and August 2000 GLOBEC cruises with {{particular emphasis on}} differences related to the regions {{north and south of}} Cape Blanco off Southern Oregon. Juvenile salmon were more abundant during the August cruise as compared to the June cruise and were mainly distributed northward from Cape Blanco. There were distinct differences in distribution patterns between salmon species: chinook salmon were found close inshore in cooler water all along the coast and coho salmon were rarely found south of Cape Blanco. Distance offshore and temperature were the dominant explanatory variables related to coho and chinook salmon distribution. The nekton assemblages differed significantly between cruises. The June cruise was dominated by juvenile rockfishes, <b>rex</b> <b>sole,</b> and sablefish, which were almost completely absent in August. The forage fish community during June comprised Pacific herring and whitebait smelt north of Cape Blanco and surf smelt south of Cape Blanco. The fish community in August was dominated by Pacific sardines and highly migratory pelagic species. Estimated growth rates of juvenile coho salmon were higher in the GLOBEC study area than in areas farther north. An unusually high percentage of coho salmon in the study area were precocious males. Significant differences in growth and condition of juvenile coho salmon indicated different oceanographic environments north and south of Cape Blanco. The condition index was higher in juvenile coho salmon to the north but {{no significant differences were found}} for yearling chinook salmon. Genetic mixed stock analysis indicated that during June, most of the Chinook salmon in our sample originated from rivers along the central coast of Oregon. In August, chinook salmon sampled south of Cape Blanco were largely from southern Oregon and northern California; whereas most chinook salmon north of Cape Blanco were from the Central Valley in California...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Demographic {{characteristics}} of juvenile Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus) {{were examined in}} relation to physical and biotic factors to develop a hypothesis explaining annual variations in recruitment. Surveys were conducted along the Oregon continental shelf at depths between 50 - 400 m bimonthly during 1989 and annually (in March) between 1990 and 1993. To determine settlement timing, growth, and mortality, daily growth increments were validated, as was position of the first post-settlement annulus. A method of estimating precision of otolith elemental composition with the electron microprobe was developed; otolith microstructure and microchemistry were used to identify a landmark associated with settlement. Mean density of 0 -group settlers varied annually, with 1989 and 1990 high, 1991 and 1992 low, and 1993 intermediate. 0 -group abundance was correlated with fall offshore divergence one year before settlement and with southward geostrophic velocity during the summer before settlement. These conditions {{may be related to}} production of prey available to pelagic larvae. Density of 0 -group Dover sole was highest between 100 - 119 m, but deeper areas were also utilized in years of highest abundance. Density was not correlated with spawning stock biomass or density of older juveniles. It was correlated with <b>rex</b> <b>sole</b> (Glyptocephalus [Errex] zachirus) density. Growth rate was positively correlated with mean April-October upwelling and was not related to density or mortality of Dover sole. First-year mortality was positively correlated with early settlement of 0 -group larvae, possibly due to an advantage of settling and migrating to the primary nursery area well in advance of the spring transition. A multiple regression model predicting density of 1 -group Dover sole from three physical environmental factors was applied to an independent time series of Dover sole "age- 5 " recruitment estimates (Turnock and Methot 1992). The model was a poor predictor of annual recruitment to fisheries but a good predictor of trends based on five-year running averages. Results suggest that multi-year trends in Dover sole recruitment to fisheries can be explained by a small set of density-independent physical factors...|$|E
40|$|Reprinted from Fishery bulletin, Vol. 76 (3), page 629 - 640. Demersal fishes were sampled {{at seven}} {{stations}} located inshore of Heceta Bank, on Oregon's continental shelf, over a 2 -yr period with a 3 -m beam trawl designed to catch small fiatfishes. Two general assemblages of fishes were recognized: a shallow water 74 - 102 m), sandy-bottom association where Pacific sanddab, Citharichthys sordidus,was numerically the dominant species, and a deeper (148 - 195 m) assemblage, generally on mud, where the slender sole, Lyopsetta exilis, predominated. <b>Rex</b> <b>sole,</b> Glyptocephalus zachirus, was usually {{the second most}} common species at all stations. Dover sole, Microstomus pacificus, ranked fourth to sixth by numbers and composed the largest biomass (wet preserved weight) at three stations. Species diversity was lowest at the shallowest station where sediments were well-sorted, fine sands that contained only 0. l' 1 organic carbon. The biomass of all fishes captured ranged from 0. 9 to 2. 4 gm - 2 These values are low compared with estimates made by others off Oregon and Washington using commercial-sized otter trawls. presumably because of avoidance of the small beam trawl by large fishes. An analysis of variance of the catches of all fishes combined, of Dover, rex, and slender soles, and of Pacific sanddab revealed few significant effects of sediment, depth or season. Sediment type had a significant effect on the catches of slender sole [...] largest catches were on a clayey-silt bottom. Catches of sanddab were inversely related to depth of water. Depth-season interactions were significant for all species combined and for rex and Dover soles, numbers were higher at the deepwater stations during winter than summer, indicating seasonal bathymetric movements. Annual variations were marked total catches and catches of most species were larger for unknown reasons during 1968 and 1969 than 1970. Based on length-frequency data, age-group 0 -(50 mm standard length(rex sole were found in high proportions at the deepest stations on {{the outer edge of the}} continental shelf.
