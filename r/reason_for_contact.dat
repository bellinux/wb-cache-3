40|$|Risk {{factors for}} Schistosoma mansoni {{infection}} were identified using a 1 : 1 matched case-control design. The work {{was conducted in}} the municipality of Pedro de Toledo, São Paulo State, Brazil, {{an area where the}} snail host is Biomphalaria tenagophila. Information on water contact patterns, knowledge, attitudes and practices (kap), socioeconomic and sanitary conditions were obtained by mean of questionnaires. The crude odds ratio estimates and the adjusted odds ratio estimates using the logistic regression model are presented. Most of the examined individuals admitted recent water contacts (90. 6 % of the cases). The most frequent <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>contact</b> was swimming, playing and fishing and the preferential site of contact was the river. According to the logistic regression technique, the main risk factors for infection were: a) water contact through swimming, playing and fishing; b) fording; c) bad hygiene. We concluded that recreational activities are the main reasons for schistosomiasis transmission in Pedro de Toledo and leisure alternatives should be offered to the local population...|$|E

40|$|In a {{study of}} {{occupational}} illness reported to a regional poison control center and to gauge the center's outreach and services, we did follow-up interviews of 301 case contacts over a 6 -month period. We ascertained referral routes, <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>contacting</b> the poison control center, and awareness of the center's function. For 122 cases a nonphysician was the initial poison control center contact. Of the nonphysician contacts, 41 had already consulted a health care provider and been referred to the poison control center for assistance. Of the 70 persons with exposure, only 21 had been aware before their exposures that poison control center services might include occupational chemical illness consultation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Contact {{with general}} {{practice}} out-of-hours services increases with socioeconomic deprivation. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this association are unclear but may include variations in access to daytime services or differences in morbidity. AIM: To identify the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>contact</b> with the Glasgow Emergency Medical Service (GEMS) {{in relation to}} patient sociodemographic characteristics {{and the nature of}} the presenting problem. METHOD: All contacts with GEMS over a one-week period (n = 3193) in October 1996 were identified and a random 1 : 2 sample were sent a postal questionnaire investigating their <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>contacting</b> the service. Sociodemographic data and presenting problems were extracted from the service contact sheet. Data were analysed using correspondence analysis. RESULTS: Correspondence analysis identified two factors characterised as 'perceived problems with daytime services' and 'perceived urgency'. Scores on the former dimension were significantly associated with age (P < 0. 0001), gender (P < 0. 0001), socioeconomic category (P < 0. 0001), and presenting problem (P = 0. 015) and scores were higher in adults, in males, among the non-affluent (particularly those resident in deprived areas), and in those presenting with a musculoskeletal problem. Scores on the latter dimension were significantly associated with age (P < 0. 0001) and presenting problem (P < 0. 0001). Scores tended to increase after childhood and for each of the five most frequent categories of presenting problem relative to other symptoms.

40|$|Background: Partners {{of cancer}} {{patients}} experience psychological distress and impaired physical health. This may affect their GP use, both {{in number of}} contacts and <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>contact.</b> Research question: Is GP use of partners of cancer patients altered in the period around the diagnosis? Methods: We included partners of 1, 288 breast cancer, 705 prostate cancer, 649 colorectal cancer and 429 lung cancer patients. Patients were diagnosed between January 2001 and December 2009 and were alive at least 2 years after the diagnosis. Based on their electronic medical files, we determined the number of GP contacts and health problems of partners between 6 months before and 24 months after diagnosis, compared to baseline (18 - 6 months before diagnosis). Results: Partners’ overall GP use {{in the six months}} before and after diagnosis was similar to baseline. Between 6 and 24 months after diagnosis, the number of GP contacts was increased in partners of breast, prostate and colorectal cancer patients (31 %(p= 0. 001), 26 %(p= 0. 001) and 19 %(p= 0. 042)) ...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} Bordetella pertussis as a {{cause of}} persistent cough in adults, we examined 201 patients who had a cough for 2 ± 12 weeks and no pulmonary disease. We obtained the following at presentation: medical history, chest radiograph, respiratory function measurement, naso-pharyngeal aspirate for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nasopharyngeal swab specimen for culture, and a blood sample (acute serum). Four weeks later a second blood sample (con-valescent serum) was obtained. Control sera were obtained from 164 age-matched healthy blood donors with no history of cough during the previous 12 weeks. Four patients were B. pertussis culture±positive; 11 (including the culture-positive patients) were B. pertussis PCR±positive; and 33, including 10 of the 11 PCR-positive patients, had serological evidence of recent B. pertussis infection. Pertussis-positive and-negative patients could not be discrim-inated by a history of cough. We conclude that B. pertussis infection is a common cause of persistent cough in adults. This is of concern, because these patients may be B. pertussis reservoirs from which transmission may occur to infants, in whom the disease can be devas-tating.

40|$|Background: Fever {{is common}} in {{children}} and often self-limiting, nevertheless antibiotics are fre-quently prescribed. We determined how often antibiotics were prescribed in children presenting with fever at a family physicians ’ out-of-hours service and established the children’s signs and symptoms related to antibiotic prescriptions. Patients: Children aged 3 months to 6 years with fever as the main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>contact.</b> Results: Of the 443 included children, 322 children had a face-to-face contact at the out-of-hours service. Of these, 117 (36. 3 %) were prescribed antibiotics, that is, 26. 5 % of the total study population. Concerned parents (OR, 2. 02; 95 % CI, 1. 06 – 3. 58), ill appearance (3. 26; 1. 30 – 8. 20), earache resulting in altered behavioral or sleeping patterns (2. 59; 1. 06 – 6. 30), signs of throat infection (2. 37; 1. 35 – 4. 15), and decreased urine production (2. 00; 1. 17 – 3. 41) were positively associated with antibiotic pre-scription. A negative association was found for age 3 to 6 months (0. 17; 0. 03 – 0. 74) and temperature (0. 52; 0. 37 – 0. 71). Conclusions: Antibiotics were prescribed in 1 out of 4 febrile children whose parents contacted the out-of-hours service. Items associated with antibiotic prescription {{provide insight into the}} family physi-cians ’ decision-making process when assessing children with fever. These can be used as targets for strategies to diminish antibiotic prescription. (J Am Board Fam Med 2012; 25 : 810 – 818. ...|$|E

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Method: Patients given the diagnosis of 'dementia' in the period 2006 - 2011 were selected from patient records of GP practices participating in the NIVEL Primary Care Database; data were also collected from the patients' partners. Patients and their partners were compared with a reference group. The number of GP contacts from 2 years before until 1 year after diagnosis were analysed. Results: There were data on 823 patients with dementia and 184 partners. People with dementia had more frequent GP contacts from 4 months before diagnosis until 8 months thereafter. The mean number of GP contacts was 21. 5 for people with dementia versus 17. 4 for people without dementia in the total 3 -year period. <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> more frequent <b>contact</b> were depression, abrasions/scratches/blisters and memory/concentration/orientation disorders before diagnosis. After diagnosis, memory/concentration/orientation disorders and general decline were more common <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>contact</b> than in the reference group. The frequency of GP <b>contacts</b> <b>for</b> partners was not significantly higher. Conclusion: People with dementia have more contact with their GP than people without dementia. From 1. 5 years before diagnosis they visit the GP with specific complaints more often. Their partners also have regular contact with their GP, especially in the year after diagnosis.

40|$|Background: Self-harm {{in young}} people is a common <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>contact</b> with {{clinical}} services. However, there is little research focusing on parents’ perspectives of care following self-harm. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore parents’ experiences of treatment and support for the young person and for themselves. Methods: A qualitative design was used to explore parents’ perspectives. Semi-structured narrative interviews were conducted across the UK with 37 parents of young people who had self-harmed. Thematic analysis was undertaken to identify themes relating to how parents experienced the help and treatment received. Results: Parents reported differing reactions to contact with helping services. Many found these helpful, particularly in keeping the young person safe, developing a trusting relationship with the young person, encouraging skills in managing self-harm and giving them an opportunity to talk about and find solutions to their difficulties. They spoke about the importance of practical help including prompt access to care, the right intensity of care, practical strategies and information and support. Some aspects of services were perceived as unhelpful, particularly a judgmental approach by professionals, lack of early access to treatment, inadequate support, or failure to listen to the perspective of parents. Conclusions: Parents’ views highlight the need for clinicians to consider carefully the perspective of parents, involving them wherever possible and providing practical help and support, including written information. The need for training of clinicians in communicating with young people and parents following self-harm is also highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} aimed to {{describe}} contact {{made by the}} elderly to Sweden's nationwide medical helpline, Healthcare Guide 1177 by Phone (HGP). Other objectives were to study potential gender differences and the association between different HGP referral levels and acute visits to hospital-based emergency departments and acute visits to primary care centres. Design: De-identified data from recorded calls to HGP was extracted for analysis (n= 7477 for the oldest age group). Information about acute visits to emergency departments and to primary care reception was extracted from the patient administration system. Setting: Vasterbotten County, Sweden. Subjects: Patients over 80 years. Main outcome measures: Calling and visiting frequencies for different age {{groups as well as}} reasons for contact and individual recommendations. Results: The utilisation rate of the telephone advice service for the oldest age group was high, with an incidence rate of 533 per 1000 person-years. Women had a 1. 17 times higher incidence rate compared with men. The most common <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>contact</b> was drug-related questions (17 % of all contacts). Calls that were recommended to care by a medical specialist correlated with total emergency department visits (r= 0. 30, p< 0. 05) and calls that were given advice correlated with acute primary healthcare visits (r= 0. 38, p= 0. 005). Conclusion: The high utilisation of the telephone advice service by the elderly gives the telephone advice service a unique ability to function as a gatekeeper to further healthcare. Our data suggest that with the telephone advice service's present guidelines, a significant proportion of all calls are being directed to further medical help. The high frequency of drug-related questions raises concerns about the elderly's medication regimens...|$|E

40|$|While {{there has}} been a growing body of {{research}} into the experiences of adopted people who approach agencies seeking information or contact with birth relatives, little is known about those formerly in care who access agency records. The findings here, reported by Derek Kirton, Erica Peltier and Elizabeth Webb, derive from a file analysis relating to adults previously in the care of The Children's Society who had sought access to their care records. The aim of the study was to find out more about the care careers of this group and their <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>contacting</b> the Society. By comparison with their adopted counterparts, those formerly in care tend to access records later in life and are more evenly balanced in terms of gender.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an endogenous growth {{model in which}} language is an engine of growth. Language is an input into production and exchange: agents who can communicate easily are able to produce and consume more. At the same time, economic interaction among agents affects the evolution of language. The model can match a key stylized fact of historical linguistics—a global increase, followed by decline, in linguistic diversity. In addition, the model generates the endogenous creation and destruction of distinct linguistic groups. Etymologists are uncertain of the exact derivation of the term “pidgin. ” Possibilities include {{that it is a}} Chinese corruption of either the English or the Portuguese term for business, that it derives from the Hebrew word for exchange or trade, or that it comes from the Chinese characters “pei, ts’in”,meaning “paying money ” (Malmkjær, 1991). Etymologists think it very likely, in other words, that there is a link between economic activity and the development of pidgin languages. More generally, since languages evolve and change in part because of interaction among different language groups, and since production and exchange are a major <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>contact</b> among groups, it is natural to believe that economic activity has influenced the development and adaptation of languages throughout history. At the same time, there is evidence that language use affects economic activity. Cross-sectional analyses of economic growth have found that, other things equal, growth is higher in countries where a “major ” language is spoken (Hall and Jones, 1999), and that growth is lower in countries {{with a high degree of}} linguistic diversity (Tamura, 1996). Gravity models of trade find that countries wit...|$|E

Method In the Youth and Mental Health Study {{a representative sample of}} 2432 junior high school students (mean age 14. 9 years, SD = 0. 6) from two counties in Central Norway were screened with the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). A subset of 345 of these adolescents (72. 5 % girls), 220 high scorers (MFQ = > 26), 74 middle scorers (MFQ 7 - 25), and 50 low scorers (MFQ Results Almost one in four subjects (23 %) had life-time depression. Prevalences of current Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Dysthymia and "Double depression" were 2. 6 %, 1. 0 % and 0. 6 %, respectively, and for Depression NOS 6. 3 %. All depressive disorders were characterized by long duration of episodes with large variations, and for any depressive disorder onset before 12 years of age.

40|$|PURPOSE: To analyse {{the type}} of {{enquiries}} to a drug information service in Germany, available exclusively for patients. METHODS: Sociodemographic characteristics of the patients who used the service, number and kind of drugs taken, existing diseases, <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> enquiry as well as type of answers provided were recorded. For the present evaluation we analysed all enquiries to the service from August 2001 to January 2007. RESULTS: A total of 5587 enquiries were received. 5013 enquiries from 4091 patients were available for further analysis in detail. The patient group using the service most frequently were women between 61 and 70 years (23. 3 %). 1457 enquiries (29. 1 %) were made by patients who had contacted the information service once or several times before. The group of drugs most often asked about were cardiovascular drugs (33. 4 %), followed by drugs for the nervous system (16. 2 %) and for the alimentary tract and metabolism (12. 4 %). On average, each patient had questions about 2. 6 (median 1; 1 - 22) drugs simultaneously. Common <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>contacting</b> the service were adverse drug reactions (22. 1 %), the need for general information about the drug (19. 9 %), information about therapy (12. 4 %) and drug interactions (10. 2 %).

Part of their mandate is to give advice and guide hospital clinicians in ethically challenging situations. We wanted to find out if clinicians who had used CEC in situations regarding individual patients found it useful and worthwhile doing. Material and methods: The local CECs were asked to forward a questionnaire to all clinicians who had discussed an individual patient case in a CEC during the foregoing 18 months. The survey was anonymous. 43 out of 86 questionnaires (50 %) were returned. Results: Most clinicians gave several <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>contacting</b> CEC, most common was the wish to get a broad discussion of the case. They found the deliberation to be very useful in this case. Ethical challenges related to foregoing of medical treatment for seriously ill patients (56 %), relative`s will (40 %) and patient autonomy (37 %) were most frequently discussed. CEC gave an advice in 50 % of the cases, and 38 % of the deliberations had practical consequences, for example foregoing of medical treatment in six cases. Interpretation: CEC discussions influence complicated decision-making processes. The committee-work is mostly evaluated as useful, and the deliberations often have practical consequences.

40|$|Aims: This study set out {{to examine}} whether women victimized by {{domestic}} violence {{in a given year}} subsequently have more health problems measured by amount of hospital contacts due to disease than non-victimized women. Methods: A case control study was carried out, based on data in the Danish National Patient Register, which covers all hospital contacts, identified by the unique citizen number. Three age groups were included: 15 – 19, 20 – 29, and 30 – 49 years. Cases were women with any hospital contact as a result of intentional injuries, defined as domestic violence, in 1995, and controls were women with all other reasons for hospital contact in 1995. The Nordic Classification of External Causes of Injuries classified <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>contact,</b> place of occurrence, and mechanism of injury. Domestic violence was defined as intentional injury by blunt force and occurring in a residential area. The rate of subsequent hospital contacts because of any disease, induced abortions, gynaecological diseases, and mental illness among cases and controls in 1996 – 98 was compared. Results: 1, 815 women victimized by domestic violence and 388, 366 controls were identified. In the entire period, the victims of violence presented significantly more health problems than the controls, as measured by hospital contacts due to any disease. The rate of contacts due to induced abortions, gynaecological diseases, and mental illness was significantly higher among the victims in all three age groups in the first year following the identified violence. In the entire period, victims of violence aged 20 – 49 presented a significantly higher rate of contacts due to mental illness, and victims aged 20 – 29 years a higher rate of induced abortions.

40|$|Stationary {{electrical}} connections and contacts, such as power connections, are commonly applied in electric power systems used for generation, {{transmission and distribution}} of electric energy. Several different degradation mechanisms can increase the contact resistance and might therefore reduce the power connection’s lifetime. The degradation by film development {{as a result of}} chemical reactions is often considered as a <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>contact</b> failure. In this research work, the impact of film development produced by chemical reactions, such as oxidation, on the long-term behavior of stationary {{electrical connections}} and contacts was studied with crossed rods. Analytical, numerical and experimental methods were applied. Typical material systems for electric power systems were considered in this study: Cu-ETP (CW 004 A) bare, silver-, nickel- or tin-coated, Al 99. 5 (EN AW- 1050 A) and AlMgSi 0. 5 (EN AW- 6060). By applying numerical methods, the mechanical stress distribution was determined within a circular contact point. The initial contact resistance and the plastic deformed area of the considered material systems was measured in experimental tests. The film’s impact was further determined through comparative experimental studies in air (standard atmosphere) and N 2 (inert gas). During the experimental tests on perpendicularly crossed rods, other degradation mechanisms such as force reduction were suppressed. The film’s impact within the formation phase was studied on copper rods in an oven at 200 °C for 1000 h. Moreover, the dependency on different environments at 90 °C (laboratory, botanical garden and outdoor) was tested for 12000 h. Additional long-term tests over 12000 h were conducted at 200 °C. The contact resistance was determined dependent on time. Furthermore, the plastic deformed area was ascertained by microscopy. It was found that the time dependent film development caused by chemical reactions such as oxidation might possibly not result in a significant degradation of stationary electrical contacts with circular contact points and a constant force. Supplementary studies were performed at 200 °C for 1000 h with perpendicularly crossed rods at low forces (3. 5 N) as well as analytical assessment of radial and axial film growth on circular contact points. The measured long-term behavior of perpendicularly crossed rods was similar for low and high forces. In order to study the long-term behavior of power connections operated in areas with harsh environmental conditions, experimental field tests on bolted busbar joints were conducted in desert and tropical rainforest environments. For over two and a half years, long-term field tests investigating bolted busbar joints made of Cu-ETP, Al 99. 5 (EN-AW- 1350 A) or AlMgSi 0. 5 (EN AW- 6060) either with or without coating (silver, tin or nickel) were conducted in Belém (Brazil), Ismailia (Egypt) and Dresden (Germany) ...|$|E
40|$|The rising {{number of}} {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) survivors {{is likely to}} impose a burden on healthcare systems. Effective resource allocation between primary and hospital care to ensure ongoing high-quality care is under discussion. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the current role of GPs during follow-up care of CRC. This study explores the primary healthcare use of patients 2 - 6 years after CRC treatment. Annual rates of face-to-face contacts, prescribed medication and referrals were compared between CRC patients and age, gender and GP matched controls in a historical prospective study. <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>contacts</b> and prescribed medication were compared based on International Classification of Primary Care and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System codes, respectively. Negative binomial regression models and non-parametric test were used. Patients showed significantly more face-to-face contacts in the 2 nd (63 %), 3 rd (32 %) and 6 th (23 %) year, more drug prescriptions in the 2 nd, 3 rd and 6 th year, and more referrals in the 2 nd and 5 th year after diagnosis. Differences in contacts and medication were related to the alimentary tract, blood and blood-forming organs, and psychological problems. This study suggests that GPs already play a substantial role during CRC follow-up and that there may be scope for formal services to be incorporated into the current model of GP care...|$|R

He managed to free Astra and every other child in Hell, but at the cost of the First returning to power; also, as part of the scheme, John's worst attributes were given separate existence as [...] "Demon Constantine" [...] which meant he himself could not go to Hell. As part of an attempt to regain his nastier edge, he used Ellie, and this led to her taking out a revenge scheme in 1998 that forced him to turn to the First for help; Ellie ended up in Hell and several of John's oldest friends left him. John, being tired of all this, contacted God. God appears and the two converse in a campfire. John then tells him his <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>contacting</b> Him. He warns God that if his soul is ever sent to Hell, he would easily take over, and do nasty things such as unleashing the demons and locking away Hell so that the damned cannot enter and have no resting place. John blackmails God to do his bidding, and that's to keep his soul away from Hell. God, knowing of John's abilities, does so. But warns him of what will come next.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{transfer}} {{of patients with}} chronic schizophrenia from large mental hospitals into the community has {{had an impact on}} the role of the general practitioner in the effective delivery of primary care services to these patients. AIM. A study was undertaken to assess the care available in general practice for patients with schizophrenia, the attitudes of general practitioners and patients to the care provided and the factors influencing patients' use of services. METHOD. Eighty three patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 26 doctors in 13 London practices registered on the VAMP research bank took part in a series of structured and semi-structured interviews. This was followed by a systematic examination of the patients' case notes. RESULTS. Only 14 patients (17 %) had no active symptoms according to the present state examination interview and 52 (63 %) were currently taking antipsychotic medication. Fifty three patients were in contact with a psychiatrist. Approximately one quarter of patients were visited by a community psychiatric nurse; in 18 of these 19 cases, the main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>contact</b> was reported to be for administration of medication by depot injection. In all but one case, patients seeing a community psychiatric nurse were also being seen by a psychiatrist. Sixteen doctors reported having had a consultation in the previous month with a patient's relative, friend or member of hostel staff. There were considerable differences between patients and their doctors in their attitudes to the use of services. Of the 26 general practitioners, 23 were enthusiastic about the possibility of introducing shared care records. Of the 54 patients in contact with a mental health professional, only 18 favoured the use of shared care records. Most of the doctors (19, 73 %) reported they would welcome a psychiatric liaison service in their practice; 40 % of 53 patients said they would not. Patients receiving antipsychotic drugs and patients registered with inner city practices attended their general practitioners more frequently than those not taking antipsychotic medication and those registered with suburban practices. Use of antipsychotic medication (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 8. 2, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 2 to 30. 7, P < 0. 01), male sex (OR 5. 8, 95 % CI 1. 5 to 22. 1, P < 0. 01) and active symptoms on the present state examination (OR 4. 1, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 17. 5, P = 0. 06) were all predictive of current contact with mental health professionals. CONCLUSION. Family doctors were closely involved with the care of patients with schizophrenia and their relatives and were eager for increased liaison with secondary care services. Although patients were more resistant than doctors to management innovations this may reflect lack of familiarity with changes in community services. Greater input is needed by mental health professionals, particularly community psychiatric nurses, and some consideration of the burden of care in inner city practices is necessary in health service planning...|$|E

40|$|Twenty-four hour {{access is}} {{accepted}} as a gold standard for palliative care service delivery, yet minimal data exist to justify {{the cost of this}} initiative to health care planners and policy makers. Further, there is scant information concerning optimal and efficient methods for delivering after-hours palliative care advice and support, particularly in regional and rural settings. This article reports on an evaluation of a local after-hours telephone support service in regional Australia. A centralized after-hours telephone support service was provided by generalist nurses at a Multipurpose Service in a rural community. A mixed-method evaluation, including semistructured interviews, was undertaken after 20 months of operation. During the period March 31, 2005 until November 15, 2006, 357 patients were registered as part of the Mid North Coast Rural Palliative Care Program. Ten percent of patients or their caregivers accessed the After-Hours Telephone Support Service, representing 55 occasions of service. The most common <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>contacting</b> the service was for reassurance surrounding medication usage, symptom management, and anxiety. This experience demonstrates proof of concept that acceptable palliative care advice can be provided by generalist nurses in a cost-efficient manner. Common patterns emerged in utilization that can assist in service planning and staffing formulae. There is also a need to investigate mechanisms of interfacing with larger scale call centers, to explore the differences within generic and disease-specific approaches, and assess the appropriateness of after-hours telephone support with different cultural groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of commercial websites provide users {{the ability to}} contact them via dedicated contact pages. In these pages, users are typically requested to provide their names, email addresses, and <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>contacting</b> the website. This effectively makes contact pages a gateway from being anonymous or pseudonymous, i. e., identified via stateful and stateless identifiers, to being eponymous. As such, the environment where users provide their personally identifiable information (PII) has to be trusted and free from intentional and unintentional information leaks. In this paper, {{we report on the}} first large-scale study of PII leakage via contact pages of the 100, 000 most popular sites of the web. We develop a reliable methodology for identifying and interacting with contact forms as well as techniques that allow us to discover the leakage of PII towards thirdparties, even when that information is obfuscated. Using these methods, we witness the leakage of PII towards third-parties {{in a wide range of}} ways, including the leakage through third-party form submissions, third-party scripts that collect PII information from a first-party page, and unintended leakage through a browser’s Referer header. To recover the lost control of users over their PII, we design and develop Formlock, a browser extension that warns the user when contact forms are using PII-leaking practices, and provides the ability to comprehensively lock-down a form so that a user’s details cannot be, neither accidentally, nor intentionally, leaked to third partie...|$|R
