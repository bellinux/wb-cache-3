40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of <b>repeated</b> <b>ties</b> in the high-tech pharmaceutical biotechnology industry, a sector that {{is characterized by a}} strong dual market structure. Our most important finding is that previous ties in pairs of large pharmaceutical companies and small biotechnology firms {{have a negative effect on}} their subsequent partnering. An explanation for this result is found in the context of understanding the specifics of large-small coalitions in a high-tech dual market structure. Unlike what is known about <b>repeated</b> <b>ties</b> in many other industries, this high-tech dual market structure indicates that R 2 ̆ 6 amp;D partnerships between a small number of very large companies and a large group of dependent, small firms are not characterized by mutual dependence, similarity, or equality...|$|R

A conventional tie over dressing with silk sutures, is a useful method of securing the graft to raw area. Refixation is difficult when <b>repeated</b> <b>tie</b> over dressings are needed. We assessed a low cost <b>repeated</b> <b>tie</b> over dressing method using sterile sample collection containers and silk suture threads in eight patients. After the graft is applied on the bed, tie-over stitches are taken, and paraffin gauze is applied over with adequate padding; the tie over sutures are passed through the container and the lid is tightened over it to complete the dressing. The lid can be unscrewed easily at any time to inspect the graft and can be easily reapplied in the outpatient department. The skin graft take in all the patients was complete without any seroma or hematoma. A novel and low-cost tie over dressing that enables simple fixation of the dressing, to maintain proper position of grafts that require repeated fixation is reported here...|$|R

30|$|The {{interest}} in implementation of PROs specifically in oncology care is {{exemplified by the}} number of recent reviews on PRO clinical applications and their impact on health outcomes [31 – 34]. All of the recent oncology reviews provide some insights on gaps in existing evidence of PRO use in clinical practice related to both challenges in implementation and PRO use impact. For example, Howell identified that more attention needs to be paid to complexity of implementation and interpretation [32]. King and colleagues [33] found a scarcity of studies reporting data on actions and medical decisions [33]. Two others—Chen [31] and Kotronoulas [34]—examined PRO intervention evidence and identified weak signals specific to changes in patient management and improved health outcomes [31, 34]. While these reviews identified important evidence gaps, none of them used an existing implementation framework to organize findings or focused on a review of publications reporting on the actual implementation of PRO in real-world settings beyond the context of a feasibility study or intervention trial. The current review makes a unique contribution to the field, by summarizing currently existing evidence using an implementation framework based on the user’s guide for the implementation of PROs in clinical practice recently developed by the International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL) [35]. The guide includes recommendations for the following implementation elements: (1) identifying the goals for collecting PROs in clinical practice and which key patient outcomes or barriers need attention; (2) considering group of patients and the care settings; (3) determining which questionnaire(s) to use (e.g., whether to use generic or disease-specific questionnaires, profile or preference-based measures, single or multi-item scales, and static or dynamic questionnaires); (4) choosing how often a patient should complete the questionnaires and whether it should be one-time completion or <b>repeated,</b> <b>tied</b> to clinic visits, or a way to monitor patients between visits; (5) deciding how the PRO will be administered and scored; (6) identifying interpretation benchmarks for the PRO score and how scores requiring follow-up will be determined; (7) developing strategies for when the PRO results will be presented and discussed with the patient (such as during or after the visit), how the results will be presented (e.g., numeric, graphical, one-time results or trends over time), and who will see the PRO score reports; (8) determining what will be done to respond to issues identified by the PROs and follow-up; and (9) evaluating the impact and value of the PRO interventions on the practice and patient [35]. While previous publications have discussed various considerations and potential applications of PROs in clinical practice [36 – 38], the ISOQOL PRO Implementation Guide is most recent and provides specific implementation guidance developed by subject matter experts and endorsed by a professional organization.|$|R

This shows that Senegalese migrants’ cross-border engagement is largely motivated by a desire to return to Senegal eventually. A logic of accumulation at origin may thus dominate a logic of integration at destination (Van Nieuwenhuyze, 2008); both of these logics, however, are potentially blocked by lack of secure legal status: migrants without “papers” are both directly blocked from transnational participation via legal exclusion from border crossing, and indirectly blocked by physical caging in the destination and the concomitant withering of social ties. Legal status is thus of key importance in keeping open the door to returns to the homeland.|$|R

50|$|As it {{can still}} be an {{advantage}} or disadvantage {{to be the first}} dealer, there are some standard methods for determining who is the first dealer. A common method is by cutting, which works as follows. One player shuffles the deck and places it on the table. Each player lifts a packet of cards from the top, reveals its bottom card, and returns it to the deck. The player who reveals the highest (or lowest) card becomes dealer. In case of a tie, the process is <b>repeated</b> by the <b>tied</b> players. For some games such as whist this process of cutting is part of the official rules, and the hierarchy of cards for the purpose of cutting (which need not be the same as that used otherwise in the game) is also specified. But in general any method can be used, such as tossing a coin in case of a two-player game, drawing cards until one player draws an ace, or rolling dice.|$|R

40|$|To promote pretrial efficiency, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has {{transferred}} 36 {{percent of}} the entire federal courts’ civil caseload to transferee judges for coordinated handling. Transferee judges then pick plaintiffs’ attorneys to lead and manage those cases, and the same attorneys appear in proceeding after proceeding. While past studies have considered repeat play on the plaintiffs’ side, the current study is the first comprehensive empirical investigation of repeat play on both sides. We found robust evidence of repeat play among both plaintiff and defense attorneys and, using social-network analysis, established that a cohesive multidistrict-litigation leadership network exists. That there are repeat players in multidistrict litigation matters considerably. Lead lawyers control the litigation, dominate negotiations, and design settlements. To consider repeat players’ influence, we examined the publicly available nonclass settlements these attorneys negotiated, looking for provisions that one might argue principally benefit the attorneys, and not one-shot plaintiffs. By conditioning the deal on achieving a certain claimant-participation rate and shifting the deal-making entities from plaintiffs and defendants to lead lawyers and defendants, <b>repeat</b> players <b>tied</b> all plaintiffs’ attorneys’ financial interests to defendants’ ability to achieve closure. Over a 22 -year span, we were unable to find any publicly available nonclass settlement that didn’t feature at least one closure provision (which benefits the defendant), and likewise found that nearly all settlements contained some provision that increased lead lawyers’ fees. Based on the limited settlements available to us, we found reason to be concerned that when repeat players influence the practices and norms that govern multidistrict proceedings — when they “play for rules,” so to speak — the practices they develop may principally benefit them at the expense of one-shot plaintiffs...|$|R
