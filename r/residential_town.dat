5|$|Originally an {{agricultural}} area noted for dairy farming, domestic spinning and weaving {{led to a}} considerable silk and, in the 20th century, cotton industry. Leigh also exploited the underlying coal measures particularly after the town {{was connected to the}} canals and railways. Leigh had an important engineering base. The legacy of Leigh's industrial past {{can be seen in the}} remaining red brick mills– some of which are listed buildings– although it is now a mainly <b>residential</b> <b>town,</b> with Edwardian and Victorian terraced housing packed around the town centre. Leigh's present-day economy is based largely on the retail sector.|$|E
25|$|Historically in Lancashire, Westhoughton {{was once}} a centre for coal mining, cotton-spinning and textile manufacture. Today it is {{predominantly}} a <b>residential</b> <b>town</b> {{with a population of}} 24,974 at the 2011 Census, having increased from 23,056 in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Godalming is {{regarded}} as an expensive <b>residential</b> <b>town,</b> partly due to its visual appeal, favourable transport links and high proportion of private housing. In recent years it has been ranked the UK's third most desirable property hotspot, and voted the fourth best area of the UK in which to live. The borough of Waverley, which includes Godalming, was judged in 2013 to have the highest {{quality of life in}} Great Britain, and in 2016 to be the most prosperous place in the UK.|$|E

Upon crossing NY31F, and thus the town line, NY153 becomes South Washington Street. The route acts as the main thoroughfare through the town, carrying approximately 10,000 vehicles per day between NY31F and West Commercial Street (unsigned NY940U). At West Commercial Street, commuters destined for I-490 are instructed to turn left to gain access via exit24, located at the west end of Commercial Street.|$|E
25|$|King's {{government}} {{greatly expanded}} {{the role of}} the National Research Council of Canada during the war, moving into full-scale research in nuclear physics and commercial use of nuclear power in the following years. King, with C. D. Howe acting as point man, moved the nuclear group from Montreal to Chalk River, Ontario in 1944, with the establishment of Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories and the <b>residential</b> <b>town</b> of Deep River, Ontario. Canada became a world leader in this field, with the NRX reactor becoming operational in 1947; at the time, NRX was the only operational nuclear reactor outside the United States.|$|E
25|$|Tin Shui Wai was {{originally}} {{an area with}} numerous fish ponds, but was developed as a <b>residential</b> <b>town</b> in 1991-1994. With the increase of internal commuter traffic demand, an LRT spur was built north of Hung Shui Kiu Stop that opened in 1993, with four stops serving the initial housing areas of the town. The area was further developed {{in the next few}} years and the line was extended by two stops: Chestwood and Tin Shui Wai Terminus in 1995 (Tin Shui Wai Terminus was renamed Tin Wing after the opening of West Rail Line). Two LRT routes were established, route 720 to Yau Oi and route 721 to Yuen Long.|$|E

25|$|MD 210 becomes six lanes again, {{crosses the}} quad-carriageway Beltway, and completes the Beltway access with several ramps {{connecting}} {{with the local}} lanes of the southbound Beltway. MD 210 continues north as a four-lane divided highway through the town of Forest Heights; the frontage road on the southbound {{side of the highway}} is Sachem Drive. At {{the north end of the}} <b>residential</b> <b>town,</b> the state highway meets the northern end of the northernmost Maryland segment of Livingston Road. Southbound MD 210 gains a third lane and the highway continues through a commercial area. The state highway becomes undivided just south of its terminus at the District of Columbia boundary at Southern Avenue. The highway continues north as South Capitol Street through Bellevue and Anacostia. Just north of the intersection, the Washington segment of Livingston Road splits to the north.|$|E
25|$|In 1691, Louvois {{instructed}} his marshals {{to destroy}} those towns which were {{to serve as}} winter quarters for imperial troops, explicitly including Pforzheim, and then continue to Wuerttemberg for further destructions. After the French troops had crossed the Rhine river {{under the command of}} Marshal Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges at Philippsburg on 3 August 1691, they assaulted the Margraves' <b>residential</b> <b>town</b> of Durlach and 1,200 cavalry men, 300 dragoons and 1,200 infantry men advanced toward Pforzheim where they arrived in the morning on 9 August and surrounded the town. When the approximately 200 imperial soldiers under the command of Captain Zickwolf and other men in the town refused to surrender, the siege began. After shelling the town during the day and the following night, the resistance of the town broke down and on 10 August in the morning the French forced the town gates open, occupied and looted it (although with little success, as there was not much left to be taken away). On 12 August, the French moved on, this time refraining from setting houses on fire. The fortification had again been damaged, though (the White Tower, the Auer Bridge Gate, the Upper Mill and the Nonnen Mill were burnt down). The French also stole all church bells, except for one minor one.|$|E
25|$|In early April as the Allied {{forces and}} notably the French Army {{advanced}} toward Pforzheim, the local German military commander gave orders {{to destroy the}} electric power generating plant and those gas and water supply lines that were still working, but citizens succeeded in persuading the staff sergeant {{in charge of the}} operation to refrain from this absurd endeavor {{in the face of the}} imminent and inevitable surrender of the German military. Likewise, orders were issued for the destruction of those bridges that had remained unscathed (some of the bridges had been destroyed by air strikes even before and after 23 February), and this could not be prevented. Only the Iron (Railway) Bridge in Weißenstein ward was saved by stout-hearted citizens who, during an unguarded moment, pulled off the fuze wiring from the explosive devices, which had already been installed, and dropped it into Nagold river. Soon after that on 8 April, French troops (an armored vehicle unit) moved into Pforzheim from the northwest and were able to occupy the area north of Enz river, but the area south of the Enz river was defended by a German infantry unit using artillery. Fighting was especially fierce in Broetzingen. The French army units (including an Algerian and Moroccan unit) suffered heavy losses; among the dead was the commander of the army unit, Capitaine Dorance. The advance of the French army came to a halt temporarily, but with the support of fighterbomber aircraft and due to the bad condition of the defenders (which included many old men and young boys who had been drafted into the Volkssturm) the French troops finally succeeded and on 18 April took possession of the vast rubble field which once was the proud <b>residential</b> <b>town</b> of the Baden Margraves.|$|E

500|$|Past NY153, NY96 {{exits the}} village of Pittsford and becomes East Avenue, a name the route retains to its {{terminus}} in downtown Rochester. It proceeds northward through the heavily <b>residential</b> <b>town,</b> passing by Nazareth College and meeting the western terminus of NY31F (Fairport Road) at a junction adjacent to the campus of St. John Fisher College. East Avenue, and likewise NY96, takes on the northwesterly, four-lane alignment set by Fairport Road and begins to parallel the routing of I-490 once more as both enter the town of Brighton. Not far to the northwest of the town line, NY96 meets Elmwood and Linden Avenues, the latter carrying NY441. About [...] to the northwest, NY96 intersects Penfield Road, the pre-expressway alignment of NY441. One block from this point is Clover Street, which carries NY65 south of East Avenue.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} the King took the throne, the city of Hanover was a densely packed <b>residential</b> <b>town,</b> and did not rise to the grand style of many German capitals. [...] Once the {{political}} crises of {{the first years of}} his reign had subsided, he set out to remedy this state of affairs. Ernest's support led to gas lighting in the city streets of Hanover, up-to-date sanitation {{and the development of a}} new residential quarter. [...] He had the plans altered in 1841, after Queen Frederica's death, to leave standing the Altes Palais, where the two had lived since arriving in Hanover. Ernest's interest in and support of the railroads led to Hanover becoming a major rail junction, much to the nation's benefit. However, when court architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves in 1837 proposed the building of an opera house in Hanover, the King initially refused, calling the proposal [...] "this utterly absurd idea of building a court theatre in the middle of this green field". The King finally gave his consent in 1844, and the opera house opened in 1852, a year after the King's death.|$|E

500|$|In {{the city}} of Brighton and Hove, on the English Channel coast of Southeast England, more than 40 former places of worship—many with {{considerable}} architectural or townscape merit—have been demolished, for reasons ranging from declining congregations {{to the use of}} unsafe building materials. [...] Brighton and Hove was granted city status in 2000 after being designated a unitary authority three years earlier through the merger of the fashionable, long-established seaside resort of Brighton and the mostly Victorian <b>residential</b> <b>town</b> of Hove. [...] In both towns, and in surrounding villages and suburbs, a wide range of Christian churches were established—mostly in the 19th and early 20th centuries. [...] More than 150 of these survive (although not all are still in religious use), but demolition and the redevelopment of sites for residential and commercial use has been happening since the 1920s. [...] Postwar trends of declining church attendance and increasing demands for land accelerated the closure and destruction of church buildings: many demolitions were carried out in the 1950s and 1960s, and five churches were lost in 1965 alone. [...] Although most of these buildings dated from the urban area's strongest period of growth in the 19th century, some newer churches have also been lost: one survived just 20 years.|$|E
