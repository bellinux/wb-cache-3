50|$|Fault {{detection}} for a {{horde of}} industrial robots experiences similar difficulties as lack of fault detection models and dynamic operating condition. Industrial robots are crucial in automotive manufacturing and perform different tasks as welding, material handling, painting, etc. In this scenario, <b>robotic</b> <b>maintenance</b> becomes critical to ensure continuous production and avoid downtime. Historically, the fault detection models for all the industrial robots are trained similarly. Critical model parameters like training samples, components, and alarming limits are set {{the same for all}} the units regardless of their different functionalities. Even though these identical fault detection models can effectively identify faults sometimes, numerous false alarms discourage users from trusting the reliability of the system. However, within a machine network, industrial robots with similar tasks or working regimes can be group together; the abnormal units in a cluster can then be prioritized for maintenance via training based or instantaneous comparison. This peer to peer comparison methodology inside a machine network could improve the fault detection accuracy significantly.|$|E

In this paper, we tried to significantly improve the speech recognition rates under non-stationary noise environments. First, 298 Navy acronyms have been selected for automatic speech recognition. Data sets were collected under 4 types of noisy environments: factory, buccaneer jet, babble noise in a canteen, and destroyer. Within each noisy environment, 4 levels (5 dB, 15 dB, 25 dB, and clean) of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) were introduced to corrupt the speech. Second, a new algorithm to estimate speech or no speech regions has been developed, implemented, and evaluated. Third, extensive simulations were carried out. It was found that the combination of the new algorithm, the proper selection of language model and a customized training of the speech recognizer based on clean speech yielded very high recognition rates, which are between 80 % and 90 % for the four different noisy conditions. Fourth, extensive comparative studies have also been carried out. Keywords—non-stationary; speech recognition; voice commands I...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objective: The {{costs to}} perform a {{hysterectomy}} are widely variable. Our objective was to determine hysterectomy costs by route and whether tra-ditionally open surgeons lower costs when performing laparoscopy versus robotics. Methods: Hysterectomy costs including subcategories were collected from 2011 to 2013. Costs were skewed, so 2 statistical transformations were performed. Costs were compared by surgeon classification (open, laparoscopic, or robotic) and surgery route. Results: A total of 4, 871 hysterectomies were performed: 34. 2 % open, 50. 7 % laparoscopic, and 15. 1 % robotic. Lapa-roscopic hysterectomy had the lowest total costs (P. 001). By cost subcategory, laparoscopic hysterectomy was lower than robotic hysterectomy in 6 and higher in 1. When performing robotic hysterectomy, open and robotic surgeon costs were similar. With laparoscopic hysterec-tomy, open surgeons had higher costs than laparoscopic surgeons for 1 of 2 statistical transformations (P. 007). Open surgeons had lower costs performing laparoscopic hysterectomy than robotic hysterectomy with <b>robotic</b> <b>maintenance</b> and depreciation included (P. 001) but similar costs if these variables were excluded.

An evident and classical solution is the use of the tele-operation and tele-robotics.

The use of virtual reality techniques with the tele-operation can be the solution for an effective remote maintenance and diagnosis.

This thesis continues on the same topic, with special focus on camera-based mapping and navigation in conjunction with automated maintenance, and automated maintenance in general. The objective of this thesis is to implement one or more functionalities based on camera-based sensors in a mobile autonomous robot. This is accomplished by acquiring knowledge of existing solutions and future requirements within automated maintenance. A mobile robot prototype has been configured to run ROS (Robot Operating System), a middleware framework that is suited {{to the development of}} robotic systems. The system uses RTAB-Map (Real-Time Appearance Based Mapping) to survey the surroundings and a built navigation stack in ROS to navigate autonomously against easy targets in the map. The method uses a Kinect for Xbox 360 as the main sensor and a 2 D laser scanner to the surveying and odometry. It is also developed functional concepts for two support functions, an Android application for remote control over Bluetooth and a remote central (OCS) developed in Qt. Remote Central is a skeletal implementation that is able to remotely control the robot via WiFi, as well as to display video from the robot's camera. Test results, obtained from both live and simulated trials, indicate that the robot is able to form 3 D and 2 D map of the surroundings. The method has weaknesses that are related to the ability to find visual features. Laser Based odometry can be tricked when the environment is changing, and when there are few unique features. Further testing has demonstrated that the robot can navigate autonomously, but there is still room for improvement. Better results can be achieved with a new movable platform and further tuning of the system. In conclusion, ROS works well as a development tools for robots, and the current system is suitable for further development.

40|$|The {{industrial}} {{world is}} in constant demand for faster, cheaper and higher quality manufacturing. Robot utilisation and automation has evolved to become a necessary asset to master {{in order to stay}} competitive in the global market. With the growing dependency on robots, unexpected downtime and brakedowns can cause devastating loss of revenue. Consequently, this has lead to an increased importance for an accurate condition based way of performing <b>robotic</b> <b>maintenance.</b> As of writing, robots are predominantly maintained through time dependent maintenance. Part replacement is based on statistical models where maintenance is performed without taking the actual robot condition into consideration. As a result an overall level of uncertainty is ensued, where lacking the ability to properly diagnose the robot, also leads to superﬂuous repairs. Because of the costly impact this has on production, a condition based maintenance approach to robots would yield increased reliability at a lower cost of maintenance. This research focuses on trying to monitor vibrations in a robot, so as to infer about wear and to provide a ﬁrst step in vibration based Robot Condition Monitoring. This research has been of multidisciplinary nature where robotics, tribology, mechanical component, signal analysis and diagnosis theory have overlapped in several areas throughout the project. The research has provided a vibration baseline and trends of the theoretical bearing defect frequencies for a hypocycloid gearbox installed on an ABB IRB 6600 robot. The gearbox was not worn to a level that a severe gearbox degradation was irrefutably detectable and analysable. Accelerometers normally used on wind turbines were used for the project, and are believed to be suﬃciently successful in capturing bearing related signals to accredit it for continued use at the preliminary stages of Robot Condition Monitoring development. A worn RV 410 F hypocycloid gearbox, was dismantled and analysed. Bearings found inside indicate high degrees of moisture corrosion and extensive surface wear. These ﬁndings had decisive roles in what future work recommendations where presented. Areas with great potential are condition monitoring through the use of Acoustic Emission and lubrication analysis. Further recommendations include investigating signal analysis techniques such as cepstrum pre-whitening and discrete wavelet transforms...|$|E

This study {{is made in the}} frame of the project "Greenhouse Module for Space System", led by the EDEN (Evolution Design of Environmentally-closed Nutrition- Sources) group of DLR Bremen for the ESA MELiSSA (Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative) project. This greenhouse module is one of the producer compartments of the MELiSSA loop, a regenerative closed system based on micro-organisms and higher plants to recycle organic wastes of the crew, revitalize the atmosphere, recycle water, and produce food. The greenhouse concepts are based on the required plant growth volumes for sustaining a crew of six on the Moon for two years. Three different concepts for external configuration are presented together with examples of how they can be outfitted internally with growth accommodations and supporting functional areas as well as space for accommodating subsystems. The greenhouse structures are composed of rigid, rigid deployable and flexible deployable components in different configurations, optimizing volume and mass, in three concepts demonstrating the principal differences between the structural concepts. The greenhouse subsystems are estimated based on currently available off-the shelf systems and the greenhouse operations consider both human and <b>robotic</b> greenhouse <b>maintenance</b> and are reflected in the architectural solutions.

METHODS: Consecutive women undergoing radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy as a sole procedure between January 2001 and February 2012 were included. We compared OR times, hospital stay, procedure specific costs, blood transfusions and cost for readmissions and re-interventions until three months after surgery for 231 women operated who received either an open (n= 51) or a robot-assisted laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (n= 180). The hospital internal charges and purchase costs were used for estimation. The specific robotic cost {{was based on an}} investment depreciation time of seven years, with 400 operations performed annually, costs for <b>maintenance,</b> <b>robotic</b> instruments, robot-specific assistant's instruments and robot draping. RESULTS: The estimated mean costs for an open radical hysterectomy was $ 12, 986, for the first 30 robotic radical hysterectomies was $ 18, 382, and for the last 30 was $ 12, 759, with a break even in cost after 90 robotic procedures. The specific robot costs ($ 3469) was, for the last robot cohort, compensated mainly by an average of 22 min shorter OR time and 4. 9 days shorter hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Given 400 robot operations annually, and only after a substantial implementation period, it is feasible to perform robot-assisted radical hysterectomy at an equal hospital cost compared with open surgery...|$|R
40|$|Recent work in dynamic graph {{algorithms}} {{has led to}} efficient algorithms for dynamic {{undirected graph}} problems such as connectivity. However, no efficient algorithms are known for the dynamic versions of fundamental directed graph problems like strong connectivity and transitive closure, {{as well as some}} undirected graph problems such as maximum matchings and cuts. We provide some explanation for this lack of success by presenting quadratic lower bounds on the certificate complexity of the seemingly difficult problems, in contrast to the known linear certificate complexity for the problems which have efficient dynamic algorithms. A direct outcome of our lower bounds is the demonstration that a generic technique for designing efficient dynamic graph algorithms, viz., sparsification, will not apply to the difficult problems. More generally, it is our belief that the boundary between tractable and intractable dynamic graph problems can be demarcated in terms of certificate complexity. In many applications of dynamic (di) graph problems, a certain form of lookahead is available. Specifically, we consider the problems of assembly planning in <b>robotics</b> and the <b>maintenance</b> of relations in databases. These give rise to dynamic strong connectivity and dynamic transitive closure problems, respectively. We explain why it is reasonable, and indeed natural and desirable, to assume that lookahead is available in these two applications. Exploiting lookahead to circumvent their inherent complexity, we obtain efficient fully-dynamic algorithms for strong connectivity and transitive closure...|$|R
