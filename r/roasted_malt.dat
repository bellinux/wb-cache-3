5|$|FES is {{the oldest}} variant of Guinness that is still available, {{although}} its ingredients and production methods have varied over time. In 1824, it had an original gravity (OG) of 1082. After a peak in strength in 1840, when the beer had an OG of 1098, by 1860, the beer was reduced to its current standard strength of around 1075 OG. FES was originally brewed with pale and brown malts. Black malt was used from 1819, and by 1828 its use had entirely replaced brown malt. In 1883, the beer was produced with 85 per cent pale malt, 10 per cent amber malt and 5 per cent <b>roasted</b> <b>malt.</b> From 1929 – 1930 onwards, Guinness switched from using <b>roasted</b> <b>malt</b> in the beer's production to roasted barley. Amber malt continued {{to be added to}} the grist until 1940. Flaked barley was introduced in the early 1950s, and the hopping rate was decreased.|$|E
25|$|The peatiness, or {{degree of}} peat flavour, of a whisky, is {{calculated}} in ppm of phenol. Normal Highland whiskies have a peat level {{of up to}} 30 ppm, and the whiskies on Islay usually have up to 50 ppm. In rare types like the Octomore, the whisky can have more than 100 ppm of phenol. Scotch Ales can also use peat <b>roasted</b> <b>malt,</b> imparting a similar smoked flavor.|$|E

50|$|Sharp's Original (4.4% abv) (occasionally {{known as}} Sharp's Own) {{was the first}} beer brewed commercially at Sharp's Brewery, gyle no. 00001 in July 1994.

40|$|Compounds {{possessing}} antioxidant activity play {{a crucial}} role in delaying or preventing lipid oxidation in foods and beverages during processing and storage. Such reactions lead to loss of product quality, especially as a consequence of off-flavor formation. The aim of this study was to determine the antioxidant activity of kilned (standard) and <b>roasted</b> (speciality) <b>malts</b> in relation to phenolic compounds, sugars, amino acids, and color [assessed as European Brewing Convention units (degrees EBC) and absorbance at 420 nm]. The concentrations of sugars and amino acids decreased with the intensity of the applied heat treatment, and this was attributed to the extent of the Maillard reaction, as well as sugar caramelization, in the highly <b>roasted</b> <b>malts.</b> Proline, followed by glutamine, was the most abundant free amino/imino acid in the malt samples, except those that were highly roasted, and maltose was the most abundant sugar in all malts. Levels of total phenolic compounds decreased with heat treatment. Catechin and ferulic acid were the most abundant phenolic compounds in the majority of the malts, and amounts were highest in the kilned samples. In highly <b>roasted</b> <b>malts,</b> degradation products of ferulic acid were identified. Antioxidant activity increased with the intensity of heating, in parallel with color formation, and was significantly higher for <b>roasted</b> <b>malts</b> compared to kilned malts. In kilned malts, phenolic compounds were the main identified contributors to antioxidant activity, with Maillard reaction products also playing a role. In <b>roasted</b> <b>malts,</b> Maillard reaction products were responsible for the majority of the antioxidant activity...|$|R

25|$|The {{invention}} of the drum roaster in 1817 by Daniel Wheeler allowed {{for the creation of}} very dark, <b>roasted</b> <b>malts,</b> contributing to the flavour of porters and stouts. Its development was prompted by a British law of 1816 forbidding the use of any ingredients other than malt and hops. Porter brewers, employing a predominantly pale malt grist, urgently needed a legal colourant. Wheeler's patent malt was the solution.|$|R
50|$|Many dunkels have a {{distinctive}} malty flavour {{that comes from}} a special brewing technique called decoction mashing. Most commonly, dunkel beers are dark lagers, but the term is also used to refer to dark wheat beers such as Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel. Dunkel weizen is another term used to refer to dark wheat beers, which are fruity and sweet with more dark, <b>roasted</b> <b>malts</b> than their lighter counterpart, the hefeweizen.|$|R
5000|$|Stout {{is a dark}} beer {{made using}} <b>roasted</b> <b>malt</b> or roasted barley, hops, water and yeast. Stouts were {{traditionally}} the generic term for the strongest or stoutest porters, typically 7% or 8%, produced by a brewery. There {{are a number of}} variations including Baltic porter, milk stout, and imperial stout; the most common variation is dry stout, exemplified by Guinness Draught, the world's best selling stout.|$|E
50|$|Typified by Rodenbach, the eponymous {{brand that}} started this type {{over a century}} ago, this beer's {{distinguishing}} features from a technical viewpoint are a specially <b>roasted</b> <b>malt,</b> fermentation by a mixture of several 'ordinary' top-fermenting yeasts and a lactobacillus culture (the same type of bacteria yoghurt is made with) and maturation in oak. The result is a mildly strong 'drinking' beer with a deep reddish-brown colour and a distinctly acidic, sour yet fruity and mouthy taste. This style {{is closely related to}} Oud bruin.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Hari {{wrote about}} the use of class IV caramel color in Newcastle Brown Ale on her blog and put public {{pressure}} on them to drop this ingredient. In January 2015, Heineken announced that they will stop adding class IV caramel color to their Newcastle Brown Ale, and will instead color it naturally with the same <b>roasted</b> <b>malt</b> they had previously used. Heineken's announcement came just prior to the release of her book, The Food Babe Way (February 10, 2015), that devotes a chapter to the ingredients—including caramel coloring—in some beers, wines, and liquors.|$|E

5000|$|In 1603, Hugh Plat {{suggested}} that coal might be charred {{in a manner}} analogous to the way charcoal is produced from wood. This process was not employed until 1642, when coke was used for <b>roasting</b> <b>malt</b> in Derbyshire; previously, brewers had used wood, as uncoked coal cannot be used in brewing because its sulfurous fumes would impart a foul taste to the beer. It was considered an improvement in quality, and brought about an [...] "alteration which all England admired"—the coke process allowed for a lighter <b>roast</b> of the <b>malt,</b> leading {{to the creation of}} what {{by the end of the}} 17th century was called pale ale.|$|R
50|$|Although beers using {{naturally}} dried malt {{would have}} been pale-coloured, by the 17th century most malts in Europe {{would have been}} dried over a fire, resulting in a dark coloured beer. When coke started {{to be used for}} <b>roasting</b> <b>malt</b> in 1642, the resulting lighter coloured beers became very popular. By 1703 the term pale ale was starting to be used, though the beer it described was a lightly hopped ale, very different from more bitter modern versions.|$|R
