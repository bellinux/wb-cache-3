40|$|Airborne {{emissions}} from hot asphalt contain mixtures of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), including several carcinogens. We investigated urinary biomarkers of three PAHs, namely naphthalene (Nap), phenanthrene (Phe), and pyrene (Pyr) in 20 road-paving workers exposed to hot asphalt and in 6 <b>road</b> <b>milling</b> workers who were not using hot asphalt (reference group). Our analysis included baseline urine samples as well as postshift, bedtime, and morning samples collected over three consecutive days. We measured unmetabolized Nap (U-Nap) and Phe (U-Phe) {{as well as the}} monohydroxylated metabolites of Nap (OH-Nap), Phe (OH-Phe), and Pyr (OH-Pyr) in each urine sample. In baseline samples, no significant differences in bio-marker levels were observed between pavers and millers, suggesting similar background expo-sures. In postshift, bedtime, and morning urine samples, the high pairwise correlations observed between levels of all biomarkers suggest common exposure sources. Among pavers, levels of all biomarkers were significantly elevated in postshift samples, indicating rapid uptake and elimination of PAHs following exposure to hot asphalt (biomarker levels were not elevated among millers). Results from linear mixed-effects models of levels of U-Nap, U-Phe, OH-Phe, and OH-Pyr across pavers showed significant effects of work assignments with roller operator...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhy not {{to apply}} {{know-how}} gained in asphalt milling to the mining of hard rock? In the mid 70 s, this idea triggered {{the development of}} a new, economically efficient opencast mining method known as Surface Miner Technology. What followed was an unparalleled success story, and it was headed by Wirtgen as the driving force behind it right from the start. 1980 marked the birth of the new and innovative surface mining process – Wirtgen developed a prototype based on <b>road</b> <b>milling</b> machines, the 3000 SM Surface Miner. Market entry was accomplished in 1983 when the first machine, a 1900 SM Surface Miner, was sold. In keeping with market requirements, Wirtgen continued to develop different machines for different applications and performance rates. Economically opencast mining of useful minerals is becoming increasingly difficult, because in many existing and also newly developed deposits the amount of useful minerals is decreasing as a result of complex geology. In rock operations, machines are needed for highly precise levelling work under restricted space conditions. Our patent remedy in both cases is mechanical exploitation by means of surface mining. This innovative technology takes account of an increasing demand for economically efficient and environmentally gentle solutions. As technology and market leader, Wirtgen is pressing ahead passionately with this method. Our know-how will enable us to successfully master all of the even more demanding challenges lying ahead. Cutting, crushing and loading the mining material in a single operational step is much more efficient than conventional mining methods...|$|E
