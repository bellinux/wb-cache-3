Yet, establishing a consistent coordinate system shared by a display and a tracker {{is a necessary}} first step for many virtual reality applications. We present a new approach for registering a tracker's and a display's coordinate system that has simple instructions, can be completed in under a minute, and does not involve understanding or manipulating any underlying linear algebra. A related technique for <b>registering</b> tracked stereo <b>glasses</b> given an arbitrarily mounted head-tracker is also presented...|$|R

5000|$|A verrophone ("glass-euphonium") is {{a musical}} instrument, invented in 1983 by Sascha Reckert, which, [...] "uses tuned glass tubes," [...] open {{at one end}} and {{arranged}} in various sizes (usually in a chromatic scale, arranged from large to small, like the pipes of a pipe organ). The sound is made by rubbing one end of {{one or more of the}} glass tubes, or also by striking them or rubbing them with a special mallet. The tubes are close together so that chords can be played by rubbing more than one at the same time. The instrument carries more acoustical volume than the glass harmonica and some other glass instruments and generally has a range from G3 to F6 (which can be extended in the higher <b>register</b> with wine <b>glasses,</b> giving it a range up to D7). Every piece composed originally for glass harmonica can be played on the verrophone.|$|R
40|$|The {{assumption}} that the isotopic ratios of anatectic melts generated in response to crust-magma interaction are equivalent to the bulk source rock from which they are derived was tested experimentally via dehydration melting of a Proterozoic biotite granite. Heating of the coarse-grained granite at 1250 Â°C for durations of 1 to 48 h produced extreme disequilibrium among simultaneously generated mafic and felsic melts (quenched to glass) and whole-rock 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. In-situ microdrill Sr isotopic analyses across gradational contacts between mafic (high- 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) and felsic (low- 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) <b>glass</b> <b>register</b> significant isotopic and chemical heterogeneity on the submillimetre scale. Our experiments suggest that {{during the early stages}} of wall-rock melting, when the rate of heating may exceed melting rates, isotopic equilibrium may not be maintained, thus producing contaminant liquids having isotopic compositions different from the bulk source rock. If isotopic equilibrium is not attained during partial melting in the crust, current geochemical models of open-system magmatic processes may require modification...|$|R
40|$|Bioactive glasses {{have been}} shown to stimulate osteogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. However, the {{molecular}} mechanisms underlying this process are still poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the behaviour of osteoblast-like cells (MG 63), cultured in the presence of bioglass particles. Three types of granules were used: 45 S 5 <b>registered</b> bioactive <b>glass,</b> 45 S 5 registered granules preincubated in tris buffer and 60 S non-reactive glass, used as control. Phase contrast microscopy permitted step-by-step visualization of cell cultures in contact with the particles. Ultrastructural observations of undecalcified sections revealed direct contacts of the cells and an electron-dense layer located at the periphery of the material. Protein synthesis was evaluated biochemically and showed a gradual increase throughout the culture time in the three types of cultures. Alkaline phosphatase was detected in situ, in clusters of packed cells either in contact with the material or in the background cell layer. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the main osteoblastic markers showed that gene expression was maintained in all three cultures. The fact that osteocalcin was not detected, supports the fact that the MG 63 cell line is composed of less differentiated osteogenic cells rather than mature osteoblasts. We also demonstrated {{for the first time in}} this cell line, the expression of Msx- 2, Dlx- 3 and Dlx- 7 homeogenes, known to regulate in vivo foetal skeletogenesis as well as adult skeletal regeneration. However, no significant differences could be recognised in the expression pattern of bone markers between the three types of cultures. Yet these preliminary results indicate that bioactive glasses provided a suitable environment for the growth and proliferation of osteoblasts in vitro, since no drastic changes in phenotype expression of pre-osteoblasts was noted...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} glass {{strength}} {{arises from the}} increasingly spread use of the material in building. Due to its high transparency, glass has been always used as closure element, {{but in recent years}} a tendency of using it for structural purpose is growing rapidly. In addition, glass provides challenging solutions for conservation of archaeological heritage. These reasons require a deep investigation on failure mechanisms of glass and above all on its resistance to tensile stress. Since 1920, linear elastic fracture mechanics allowed understanding the reasons of the low tensile strength values <b>registered</b> in <b>glass.</b> It seems that {{this is due to the}} propagation, even very slow, of surface microdefects induced by manufacturing processes. Later, physical theories empirically founded further investigated on the processes of rupture in glass, observing that microdefects may evolve up to structural failure not only for a stress increase but also as consequence of chemical-physical interaction with surrounding environment. Most of prediction models which aim at evaluating a glass element lifetime are based on empirical laws. The parameters of those theories are related to the influence of environment but their values are provided by the literature only within limited ranges. However, the influence of environmental variables is complex and not secondary. In addition, in recent years, glass is being used in building even in non favorable climatic conditions. This latter is a challenging aim, considering the high aesthetic qualities of glass. For these reasons, the present thesis considered necessary to investigate on the microphysics and chemistry which determine the phenomenon of environmental corrosion, and this allowed identifying the physical variables which play the most influent role. Secondarily, an expression of failure time as explicit function of environmental variables is provided, focusing on temperature and relative humidity. Through parameter calibration, on the basis of four-point beam-bending tests, a lifetime curve is obtained for a given environment. This work arises on the one hand from a physical interest and it shows a scientific coherence, considering the strong influence of environmental variables, and on the other hand it is strictly connected to design purposes, since glass is being used in increasingly disparate climatic conditions. For this latter reason, to be able to express failure time as function of environment becomes a non negligible need...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis was to investigate different mechanical and chemical pre-treatments which can dramatically change the properties of native cellulose and add alternative routes to structure formation. Ball milled cellulose, which had a reduced crystallinity, degree of polymerisation and degradation temperature, was rehydrated in excess water resulting in recrystallisation. Fully amorphous samples recrystallised to the more thermodynamically stable type II polymorphic crystal structure. Flash differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which allows thermal transitions to be scanned at much higher rates than conventional DSC, was able to <b>register</b> a <b>glass</b> transition temperature for amorphous cellulose. The next stage of the study focussed on the production of freeze dried galactomannan foams. Cellulose fibres provided reinforcement to the foams. The level of reinforcement was related to fibre content, size, crystallinity and surface roughness. Microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) provided the greatest reinforcement due to its much higher surface area and fibrillated structure. Extrusion {{was found to be}} a useful alternative to homogenisation for the production of MFC and to create foams using alternative processing to the freeze drying routes. A novel molten salt hydrate, LiCl/urea/water, was found to swell native cellulose and reduce its crystallinity. A weak gel-like structure was formed at ambient temperature. Micro DSC results showed that this structure was melted out at 60 oC but the process was reversible indicating hydrophilic to hydrophobic conformational changes {{on the surface of the}} cellulose fibres, although these were likely to be dependent on the celluloses having a low degree of polymerisation. In these solvent conditions starch granules were eroded from the outside rather than being swollen as has been found for some ionic liquids and underwent total dissolution in LiCl/urea/water. Fenugreek and xyloglucan, which are both highly branched, were found to increase in viscosity in LiCl/urea/water relative to water, possibly due to the breakage of all intramolecular associations whereas the viscosity of konjac which is predominantly unbranched did not change. Locust bean gum (LBG) had a lower viscosity in LiCl/urea/water compared to water due to the disruption of aggregates. Confocal microscopy showed that fenugreek and LBG are able to bind to cellulose in water, however, the conformational change of fenugreek in these solvent conditions inhibited it from binding to cellulose in LiCl/urea/water whereas conformational change allowed xyloglucan to bind to cellulose in LiCl/urea/water whilst it was unable to bind in water. Konjac did not bind to cellulose in either solvent system. The pre-treatments shown in this work will enable the creation of novel cellulose composites...|$|R
