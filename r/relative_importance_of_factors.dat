Over the decades up to the year 2000, the Brazilian states have experienced a relevant capital deepening process, which account for income per work catching-up. However, the TFP gaps in relation to the reference state remain almost stable and their reduction is fundamental to the maintenance of the Brazilians states income per worker catching-up process. The conclusions remain similar when the analysis is conducted by means of distinct proxies of physical capital. When considering the human capital qualitative aspect, we noticed a greater human capital gap among the Brazilian states in relation to São Paulo State and, as a consequence, a reduction in the TFP relative gap...|$|R
