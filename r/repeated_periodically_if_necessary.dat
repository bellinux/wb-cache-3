30|$|We note that, {{to elude}} masking effects due to {{significant}} {{variation of the}} frequencies, {{it is expected that}} the estimation of the frequencies would be <b>repeated</b> <b>periodically.</b> <b>If</b> the deviation between the values obtained was greater than a fixed threshold, the frequencies are updated and the analysis restarts with these new values. We also note that a different choice is required for the damping factors in the Prony and ESPRIT methods. The damping factors, in fact, are able to take into account temporal variations of the amplitudes of the spectral components and to link two consecutive sliding windows smoothly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{owners manual}} for the cloth bag {{equipped}} machines {{recommended that the}} cloth bag be emptied after cleaning had been finished, to avoid dirt and bacteria from setting in the fibers of the bag, and preparing the machine for the next time. The cloth bag can be laundered <b>periodically,</b> <b>if</b> <b>necessary.</b> Starting with the Tradition model, an internal, disposable paper bag was introduced optionally {{in addition to the}} cotton cloth bag, so that customers could decide which method they preferred. The disposable paper bag offered the convenience of storing the cleaner when finished, and not requiring that the bag be emptied every time. When the Generation 3 was introduced in 1990, the only method of dirt collection was the disposable paper bag, and was later labeled [...] "Micron Magic" [...] with the Model G4, which can trap particles larger than three microns, while the cotton cloth bag traps any remaining particles that pass through. Starting with the Ultimate G Diamond Edition, the disposable paper bag was upgraded to HEPA standards.|$|R
