40|$|Building on and {{extending}} prior research, we propose a comprehensive framework which posits that {{free cash flow}} moderates the impact of corporate governance on financial diversification. We argue that because it increases CEO perceived <b>risk,</b> <b>alignment</b> devices increase rather than decrease financial diversification. In a sample of 59 publicly traded French corporations during 2000 - 2006, we show that financial diversification negatively impacts shareholder return and firm value. We obtain support for several of our hypotheses: at high levels of free cash flow, CEO variable compensation increases financial diversification, whereas chairman/CEO non-duality reduces it. In contrast, independent directors increase financial diversification at low values of free cash flow (although weakly). We also find that ownership concentration only reduces financial diversification when free cash flow is low. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

First and follow-up visits for breast cancer genetic counselling of 96 counselees of a Dutch genetics center were videotaped (2008 - 2010). Counselees completed questionnaires before counselling (T 1), after the follow-up visit (T 2) and one year after the follow-up visit (T 3). Consultations were rated with the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS). Counselee participation was measured as the percentage of counselee utterances, the percentage of counselee questions and the interactivity (number of turns per minute). Follow-up visits had higher levels of counselee participation than first visits as assessed by the percentage of counselee talk, the interactivity and counselee questions. More counselee talk in the follow-up visit was related to higher achievement of the preferred role (T 2) and higher perceived personal control (T 3). Higher interactivity in the follow-up visit was related to lower achievement of the preferred role in decision making and lower information recall (T 2). There were no significant associations with the percentage of questions asked and none of the participation measures was related to knowledge, <b>risk</b> perception <b>alignment</b> and perceived personal control (T 2). In line with the interviewing admonishment 'talk less and listen more', the only assessment of counselee participation associated to better outcomes is the percentage of counselee talk. High interactivity might be associated with lower recall in breast cancer genetic counselees who are generally highly educated. However, this study was limited by a small sample size and a heterogeneous group of counselees. Research is needed on the interactions causing interactivity and its relationships with involvement in decision making and recall. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

Requirements have proven particularly sticky in this as it is often the case that they can not be fully implemented when time and resources are limited introducing additional risk to the project. A practical approach to mitigating this <b>risk</b> in <b>alignment</b> with the WinWin development approach is to have the critical stakeholders for the project collaboratively negotiate requirements into priority bins which then are scheduled into an appropriate incremental development life cycle. We have constructed a system called the Distributed Collaboration Priorities Tool (DCPT) to assist in collaborative prioritization of development items. DCPT offers a structurally guided approach to collaborative prioritization much in the spirit of USC’s WinWin requirements capture and negotiation system. In this paper, we will discuss the prioritization models implemented within DCPT via an actual prioritization of new WinWin system features.

The resulting analysis model consists of both a direct and an indirect type of social cyber contract between governments, citizens and corporations, within and between sovereign nations. To show its effectiveness, the proposed social cyber contract model is validated through an illustrated case examining various constitutional rights to privacy, their embedding in the national cyber strategies and how their differences could cause potential barriers for alignment across sovereignties.

This study assessed {{the effects of a}} website with tailored information and a blank sheet to fill in questions (question prompt; QP), at 1 week and 1 year post-counseling. Methods: Consecutive counselees were randomized to the usual care group (UC) or the intervention group (UC + website + QP). Counselees completed questionnaires pre- and post-counseling and 1 year follow-up. We conducted multilevel regression analyses corrected for time. Results: Intervention group counselees (n = 103) were more satisfied about their final visit (b =. 35; CI:. 06 –. 65; P =. 02; n = 156) than UC group counselees (n = 94). Intervention group counselees also reported more positive experiences with the counseling (b =. 32; CI:. 06 –. 59; P =. 02; n = 188) and higher perceived personal control 1 year post-counseling (b =. 51; CI:. 18 –. 84; P =. 002; n = 193).

The capacity to transfer risk knowledge affects all stakeholders {{and understanding of the}} risk knowledge about the enterprise’s value is a key requirement in order to identify protection strategies for business sustainability. There are various factors that affect this capacity for transferring and understanding. Previous work has established that {{there is a difference between}} the influence of KM variables on Risk Control and on the perceived value of ERM. Communication among groups appears as a significant variable in improving Risk Control but only as a weak factor in improving the perceived value of ERM. However, the ERM mandate requires for its implementation a clear understanding, of risk management (RM) policies, actions and results, and the use of the integral view of RM as a governance and compliance program to support the value driven management of the organization. Furthermore, ERM implementation demands better capabilities for unification of the criteria of <b>risk</b> analysis, <b>alignment</b> of policies and protection guidelines across the organization. These capabilities can be affected by risk knowledge sharing between the RM group and the Board of Directors and other executives in the organization. This research presents an exploratory analysis of risk knowledge transfer variables used in risk management practice. A survey to risk management executives from 65 firms in various industries was undertaken and 108 answers were analyzed.

The current NHTSA analysis is the most thorough investigation of this issue to date. LBNL's assessment of the analysis indicates that the estimated effect of mass reduction on risk is smaller than in the previous studies, and statistically non-significant for all but the lightest cars. The effects three recent trends in vehicle designs and technologies have on societal fatality risk per VMT are estimated, and whether these changes might affect the relationship between vehicle mass and fatality risk in the future. Side airbags are found to reduce fatality risk in cars, but not necessarily light trucks or CUVs/minivans, struck in the side by another light-duty vehicle; reducing the number of fatalities in cars struck in the side is predicted to reduce the estimated detrimental effect of footprint reduction, but increase the detrimental effect of mass reduction, in cars on societal fatality <b>risk.</b> Better <b>alignment</b> of light truck bumpers with those of other vehicles appears to result in a statistically significant reduction in risk imposed on car occupants; however, reducing this type of fatality will likely have little impact on the estimated effect of mass or footprint reduction on risk. Finally, shifting light truck drivers into safer, car-based vehicles, such as sedans, CUVs, and minivans, would result in larger reductions in societal fatalities than expected from even substantial reductions in the masses of light trucks.

40|$|Social {{enterprises}} {{apply the}} best of business for the pursuit of social or environmental mission while also generating revenues. Globally, nearly 1, 3 billion people lack access to electricity, as well as another billion having access to only low quality and infrequent electricity. Off-grid renewable energy, like solar, will increasingly have {{a key role in}} the solution of the energy access issue. The pioneer gap in off-grid renewable energy consists of financing (or funding) gaps and capacity gaps, to do with both the early stage of the enterprises in question, as well as the early stage of the whole industry. The gaps are emphasised by specific characteristics of off-grid renewable energy business models and the requirements of operating in bottom-of-the-pyramid markets. The marketing perspective to fundraising is chosen to uncover the possible role enterprises themselves have in bridging the pioneer gap. The purpose of this thesis is to study how social enterprises operating in off-grid renewable energy in Africa utilise marketing activities in their investor relations in bridging the pioneer gap. This main research question is divided into the following sub-questions:  How does the pioneer gap affect fundraising for these enterprises?  How are the funding needs for these enterprises characterised?  How do these enterprises build trust in their investor relations? The theoretic framework is built on relationship marketing and investor relations, with an emphasis on creation of trust. The research is conducted as a thematical case study. Primary data is gathered via semi-structured interviews with six solar energy companies and two accelerators. According to the findings, the main components affecting trust-creation are diminished information asymmetry and perceived <b>risk,</b> mission <b>alignment</b> as well as a personal fit or relationship with the investor. Therefore, an enterprise can utilise e. g. the following marketing activities in their investor relations to bridge the pioneer gap: ensuring investor material, the enterprise story and presenting of them is clear, concise and complete to “package” the enterprise as an investment; taking investor needs and motivations into account as well as utilising existing investors as ambassadors...|$|R

To find out whether this immunogenetic control could be connected with the antigen binding and presentation function of the α 1 domain of class II molecules, we have sequenced the exon 2 of the four DRα EcoRI and six of the seven DQα PvulI restriction fragment length polymorphism alleles identified, and deduced the encoded amino acid sequences. We found no amino acid polymorphism among DRα alleles, indicating that the α 1 domain of the DRα chain does not condition wart regression or cancer development. In contrast, 27 of the 82 amino acids of the DQα 1 domain were found variable, defining five amino acid sequence alleles. The restriction fragment length polymorphism allele linked to regression and another allele not linked to regression share the same at domain, indicating that wart regression is rather conditioned by a closely linked gene. The most divergent DQα 1 allele, how- ever, was that associated with a higher <b>risk</b> of cancer. <b>Alignment</b> of rabbit and human DQα exon 2 alleles disclosed that amino acid charge variations occur at positions assumed to be important for peptide binding in humans.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Throughout the years, organisations {{were known}} for only {{reporting}} on their financial position, {{but due to}} stakeholders becoming more informed about the sustainability crisis, organisations realised the importance of moving away from only reporting on financial information and are now also including information {{about the impact of}} their activities on the society and environment in which they operate in sustainability reports. King II stipulated that organisations should produce a sustainability report during their reporting period, while King III recommends integrated reporting. Integrated reporting suggests that both the annual and sustainability report should be published at the same time. As a result, King III places a lot of emphasis on the <b>alignment</b> <b>risk,</b> performance, strategy and sustainability. This allows the integrated report to supply all stakeholders with forward looking information, as well as strategic direction. The purpose for this research is to evaluate the extent to which organisation in the banking industry disclose information about their strategy. Information were gathered and analysed to determine where aspects of strategy are disclosed at an above average to excellent level or whether strategy disclosure were lacking or below average. This study specifically focussed on information disclosed in the 2010 annual and sustainability reports of organisations in the banking industry such as Absa, Investec, Nedbank, Standard Bank and FirstRand.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{emergence}} of the long-term climate target to hold the increase in global average temperature below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This ‘two degrees target’ is shown to be the product of efforts to embed climate science, ‘cost-effective’ GHG control, and national sovereignty in a long-term climate goal, and that it became a foundation for work to align the financial sector with the transition to a lowcarbon economy. This thesis investigates how this target envisages an apparently simple and manageable future for addressing climate change, and comes to orient the strategies of diverse and distributed actors towards a common vision. The empirical core of this thesis is a participant observation of a United Nations and Greenhouse Gas Protocol standard-setting project, which is supplemented by semi-structured interviews and documentary analysis. This thesis studies four interrelated instruments, the two degrees target, the carbon budget, investment roadmaps and an emergent carbon accounting standard. It focuses on the work involved in assembling and adjusting these instruments, attending to the efforts to produce coherent and stable linkages between ideas of climate governance and the local specifics of the financial sector. This thesis shows how a carbon-constrained future with financial sector implications was envisaged. It also traces how ideas stemming from the two degrees target shifted the development of finance-specific carbon accounting practices away from greenhouse gas data and towards metrics for managing <b>risk</b> and monitoring <b>alignment</b> with investment roadmaps. This thesis, as a whole, contributes to our understanding of carbon accounting as a practice that embeds diverse modes of climate governance and coordinates action across multiple entities. It shows the processes through which an apparently simple vision for addressing climate change began to orient diverse and distributed efforts towards financing the transition to a low-carbon economy...|$|R

Put differently, this “raise-up” bridges the valley of death and enables the corporate to exploit radical innovations. “Raise-ups” are created to exploit a unique market opportunity that the corporate faces and consists {{of a team of}} entrepreneurs and corporate specialists. Accenture supports these immature, high potential teams in their development by offering support on all risk factors to more easily bridge the “valley of death”. Building “raise-ups” is a unique model that is executed by Accenture between corporate clients and start-ups. It combines start-up and corporate characteristics to jointly create new radical value. “Raise-ups” provide competitive advantage, low financial and implementation <b>risk,</b> improved corporate <b>alignment,</b> and a proposition platform that is ready for scale up. The knowledge that is generated through this research from a theoretical perspective is translated into a practical solution for Accenture. To structure this approach from theory to practice, a process is defined that consists of the phases that a “raise-up” goes through: scout, develop and deploy. This process is supported through the creation of a Joint Innovation Foundry, where the “raise-up” tackles problems such as overcoming the corporate hug of death, creating a corporate landing zone, and the transition from open to closed innovation. Afterwards, an implementation model is designed to support the integration of knowledge by identifying building blocks that should be developed and capabilities that should be adopted. This thesis report aims to provide Accenture with a new perspective on value creation by advising the organisation on capability development towards the front end of new product development.

40|$|Today {{the extent}} and value of {{electronic}} data is constantly growing. Dealing across the internet depends on how secure consumers believe their personal data are. And therefore, information security becomes essential to any business with any form of web strategy, from simple business-to-consumer, or business-to-business {{to the use of}} extranets, e-mail and instants messaging. It matters too any organization that depends on computers for its daily existence. This master thesis has its focus on Information Security Governance. The goal of this thesis was to study different Information Security processes within the five objectives for Information Security Governance in order to identify which processes that organizations should prioritize in order to reduce negative consequences on the data, information and software of a business from security incidents. By surveying IT experts, it was possible to gather their relative opinion regarding the relationship between Information Security Governance processes and security incidents. By studying the five desired objectives for Information Security Governance, Strategic <b>Alignment,</b> <b>Risk</b> Management, Resource Management, Performance Measurement and Value Delivery the result indicated that some processes within Performance Measurements have a difference in relation to other processes. For those processes a conclusion can be made that they are not as important as the processes which they were compared to. A reason for this can be that the processes within performance measurement are different {{in such a way that}} they measure an incident after it has actually happened. While other processes within the objectives for ISG are processes which needs to be fulfilled in order to prevent that an incident happens. This could obviously explain why the expert‟s choose to value the processes within performance measurement less important compared to other processes. However, this conclusion cannot be generalized, since the total amount of completed responses where less than expected. More respondents would have made the result more reliable. The majority of the respondents were academicals and their opinion and experience may be different from the IT experts within the industry, which have a better understanding of how it actually works in reality within an organization...|$|R
