50|$|Having no {{political}} champion in Ottawa, with no support from HQ Militia District No.6 in Halifax, and thus {{no chance of}} active service, on 24 January 1917, the much reduced 105th Bn was amalgamated with the 104th Battalion, CEF. It having earlier come to England, from New Brunswick, and after a change of command, the CO of the 105th, Lt-Col Ings assumed command. The new 104th (NB) Battalion, was quickly absorbed into the 13th Canadian Reserve Battalion, CEF, it only having been organized on 20 January 1917 (as authorized in OMFC Canadian <b>Routine</b> <b>Order</b> 271 of 20 January 1917). When reinforced and again designated for service in France, the 104th (NB) Battalion {{was assigned to the}} 15 Brigade, 5th Canadian Division, on 13 February 1917. Remaining in England, seeing the 5th Division 'officially' disbanded in April 1918, the 104th was finally broken up and, its remaining Islanders, absorbed by the 13th Reserve Battalion.|$|E
50|$|In August 1916, {{individual}} battalions of the Canadian Corps {{were ordered}} to wear a distinguishing patch to better provide command and control in battle. Battalions were represented {{by a series of}} coloured geometric patches that corresponded to their seniority within the brigades of the overseas divisions of the corps. These shapes were sewn over top of a rectangle 3 in wide by 2 in tall which was also colour coded by division, and worn on the upper rear of each soldier's uniform jacket and greatcoat, just below the collar. The location was quickly moved from the collar to the sleeve. The 3rd Division was originally ordered to wear white patches, followed ten days later by an order changing the colour to black and the location. In May 1917, the commander of the 3rd Division published a <b>routine</b> <b>order</b> stating that, because the black patches were too difficult to see, French grey was to be worn instead.|$|E
5000|$|Constitution {{was built}} {{in an era when}} a ship's {{expected}} service life was 10 to 15 years—and she was 31 years old when she was mothballed. Secretary of the Navy John Branch made a <b>routine</b> <b>order</b> for surveys of ships in the reserve fleet, and commandant of the Charlestown Navy Yard Charles Morris estimated a repair cost of over $157,000 for Constitution. On 14 September 1830, an article appeared in the Boston Advertiser which erroneously claimed that the Navy intended to scrap Constitution. Two days later, Oliver Wendell Holmes' poem [...] "Old Ironsides" [...] was published in the same paper and later all over the country, igniting public indignation and inciting efforts to save [...] "Old Ironsides" [...] from the scrap yard. Secretary Branch approved the costs, and Constitution began a leisurely repair period while awaiting completion of the dry dock then under construction at the yard. In contrast to the efforts to save Constitution, another round of surveys in 1834 found her sister ship Congress unfit for repair; she was unceremoniously broken up in 1835.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the castle}} was taken, the wounded Hentzi {{was found in}} the {{hospital}} he was taken, by the Hungarian officer, Lieutenant János Rónay, where the Austrian commander was declared prisoner. Chief medical officer Moritz Bartl told to the Hungarian officer, that Hentzi's wound is fatal, and cannot be saved. Rónay behaved kindly towards him, but when Hentzi wanted to shake hands with him, he refused, saying that he respects him as an excellent general, but he will not shake his hand, because of the bombardment of Pest. [...] Hentzi replied that his cannons could destroy the whole Pest, but he didn't, he just shot in the buildings which he had the orders to do it. As we showed before, Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Welden's orders to Hentzi contained nothing about the destruction of Pest, he allowing him to bombard the city from the Eastern bank of the Danube, only in exceptional situations, when the civilians would behave towards the castle in an unacceptable manner, which they did not. [...] Than Lieutenant Rónay transported Hentzi to the Hungarian headquarters, but while headed to the destination, on the Dísz Square, the people recognized Hentzi, and wanted to harm him because of what he did to Pest, and only the strong opposition of Lieutenant Rónay saved the wounded general from being lynched. Around this event had born the legend of Artúr Görgei defending the dead body of Hentzi against the enraged mob, about which in those times many depictions had been drawn. Arriving to the destination many Hungarian officers (Gen. József Nagysándor, Col. Lajos Asbóth, and in the end Görgei himself) visited Hentzi, behaved kindly towards him, but when they asked, what is his wish, he replied that he wants to dye. When asked why he wants this, he replied that he knows that if he will recover, Görgei will hang him, remembering the threat of the Hungarian general in his letter to him, demanding the surrender of the castle, if he will bombard Pest, or blow the Chain Bridge. Görgei indeed did not forgot his promise made in 4 May, declaring in that day to Lieutenant-Colonel Bódog Bátori Sulcz, that he will hang Hentzi in the next day if he will recover, saying that the Austrian general does not deserve to be named as hero. In the evening the health condition of Hentzi became critical, and Rónay sent for a priest, but seemingly they did not found any, maybe because no priest wanted to give him the extreme unction. Hentzi died at 22 May 1 o'clock in the morning. His and Col. Alnoch's bodies were put in two unpainted coffins, and sent to the graveyard, under the escort of a Huszár squad, {{in order to protect the}} bodies from the populations anger. In 1852 the emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria ordered a monument destined to Heinrich Hentzi, who deserved this not because the senseless damages caused to the capital cities, which in October 1918 was finally dismantled.The chivalry of the Hungarian officers was not shared by all of their soldiers. Görgei wrote in his <b>routine</b> <b>order</b> nr. 755/v, that after the capture of Buda Castle, some of the Hungarian soldiers, robbed the houses of the residents of the castle, confiscating valuable objects from them, but also the properties of the state and archives. This is why he orders that in 24 hours, all the robbed objects to be returned, or else those who do not respond to this order, will be judged before the court-martial.Although General Mór Perczel accused Artúr Görgei of intentionally delaying the occupation of the Buda Castle, wanting with this to give time to the Austrian troops from around Vienna and Pozsony, to recover, wanting to convince the Hungarian government from Debrecen, to cite Görgei before the court-martial, the liberation of the castle created a huge satisfaction among the Hungarians, which convinced Prime Minister Bertalan Szemere to award Görgei with the First Class Military Order of Merit and the rank of Lieutenant General. But when he was visited by the delegation from the Government to invest him with the order and the promotion in rank, Görgei refused, saying that he do not deserve these and he do not agree with the rank and order hunger of many of the soldiers and officers, this is not compatible with the Republican political program of Prime Minister Szemere, and by refusing these distinctions, he wants to show an example to his subordinates. The leaders of the Government's delegation, Senator Zsigmond Bernáth and Deputy Gábor Kazinczy saluted the decision of Görgei. Görgei, in his meeting with the two politicians told them, that after the capture of Buda, planned to make a coup d'état, and force with his army the withdrawal of the Declaration of the Hungarian Independence, thinking that this political act of the Hungarian Parliament makes impossible any kind of compromise with the imperial Government from Vienna and the emperor, because he taught that after the threat of the Russian intervention became more and more clear, the only hope for Hungary to save at least a part of the Hungarian autonomy and achievements of the Hungarian revolution from 15 March 1848, was an agreement with the emperor. But when he heard from Bernáth and Kazinczy, that they share his opinions and that in the Hungarian parliament is a party, called the Peace Part (Békepárt) which wants an agreement with emperor Franz Joseph I., he renounced to his plan about the coup, and declared that he hopes a political, [...] "constitutional" [...] solution for this problem.After receiving the news about the capture of Buda, on 22 May, governor Lajos Kossuth and prime minister Bertalan Szemere published Görgei's report about this victory, with a postscript, in which they wrote: [...] "You crowned your campaign, you conducted so far with the capture of the ancient Castle of Buda. You gave back to the Motherland its capital, to the National Assembly and to the Govern their seat. Furthermore, through this victory, you urged or rather made possible, that our national independence to be recognized by Europe." [...] On 23 May, Kázmér Batthyány the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary wrote a letter to Ferenc Pulszky, the delegate of the Hungarian Szemere Government to London, that after the liberation of Buda, he is sure that the European nations, who were reluctant until than, to accept Hungary's declaration of the independence, as a [...] "fait accompli", would open their diplomatic relations with Hungary. Thus the Hungarian politicians believed that the conquest of Buda will prevent Russia to intervene in the conflict between Hungary and the Habsburg Empire, because the European countries will accept Hungary as an independent state. But the later events had shown that these hopes were groundless, and the European nations looked away when in June 200 000 Russian soldiers crossed the Hungarian border in order to crush the Hungarian independence. On the other hand, after the mod of April and in May 1849, during the victorious Spring Campaign of the Hungarian Revolutionary Army, the imperial commanders and politicians had a constant fear of a Hungarian attack against Vienna, feeling that they could not repulse such an attack, if the Russian intervention will not begin in time. About Görgei's plans the imperial intelligence had no clear informations, but the correspondence of the political and military leaders show that they taught that if the Hungarian army would have cross the Austrian border, without the help of the Russian armies, they would have no chance to repulse it. The imperial reports show a constant concern, which lasted several weeks, about a Hungarian attack against Austria, which would be helped by the revolutionary forces from Vienna and the Austrian provinces. [...] For example, a letter of Prime Minister Schwarzenberg shows that the people of Vienna is again in revolutionary mood, and when Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz, the former high commander of the imperial forces in Hungary, after his dismissal because of his defeats on the Hungarian front, when he returned to Prague, the people gathered and shoot in front of him: [...] "Long live Kossuth!" [...] This constant fear of the imperial commanders and politicians also show the talent of General Ernő Poeltenberg the commander of the Hungarian commander of the Hungarian VII. Corps, numbering around 12 000 soldiers, who with his demonstration maneuvers, not only kept at bay the numerically much superior (more than 50 000) imperial troops, but also made them to believe that his troops are capable to start a successful advancement against the Austrian Hereditary Provinces. Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Welden, the high commander of the imperial forces from Hungary, wrote to Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, the Minister-President of the Austrian Empire, urging the Russian intervention, writing that the revolutions from Italy and Germany could reignite if the Hungarian military successes continue, and the Hungarian Revolution will not be put down immediately. Schwarzenberg wrote in 1 May, that the first Russian troops, consisting of 85 000 soldiers, already entered the Austrian province of Galicia and took position in the vicinity of the Hungarian border, waiting for further orders. But as shown before (Towards Vienna or to Buda?), before and during the Siege of Buda, the Hungarian army was in an important numerical inferiority towards the imperial forces gathered around Pozsony and Vienna, so the fears of the Habsburg commandment were groundless.|$|E

40|$|Background to the {{academic}} research. Hilton College is an all boys private school in the Kwa-Zulu Natal Midlands. Since the beginning of 2012 boys have been permitted to carry their phones during the school day, (Thomson, 2012). Wireless internet access was also extended across the campus to allow boys and staff to bring their own devices to class and {{have access to the}} internet (Machlachlan, 2012). In the past, communication between staff and boys was either verbal or {{through the use of a}} daily notice, called the Daily <b>Routine</b> <b>Order</b> (DRO). The DRO is placed at the dining room tables each day and boys are expected to check for any notices that may pertain to them. These notices are emailed to a secretary who prints them out and places them in the dining room each day at lunch. 2. Objectives to the research. This research sought to establish whether current communication methods were effective or whether the prevalence of mobile phones and wireless devices had presented the school with a more effective method. It was important therefore, to investigate what devices were on campus, how those devices were used and when they were used. In addition to this, the research sought to establish communication preference among staff and boys. 3. Research Methodology. The research was conducted through the use of a qualitative survey that was conducted among both staff and boys. Staff and boys were surveyed to establish generation, device prevalence, device usage and device preference. This data was collected using an anonymous qualitative survey that was administered through the use of Google docs in the school labs. 187 Boys in 3 grades 8 and 9 participated in the survey along with 18 staff members. The data was then analysed and compared to data from similar research that had been conducted elsewhere in the world. Because of significant age differences between boys and staff it was critical to establish whether device usage among staff and boys was tied to their generation. Of particular interest were the device behaviours associated with the Millennial generation, who were born between 1982 - 2002 (Strauss 2005 : 10). This generational ‘benchmark’ allowed the researcher to compare the Hilton College cohort to those whose device behaviours and usage had occurred and been discussed in generational research elsewhere. It also allowed for certain assumptions to be made about staff and boys based on their generational profile. 4. Findings It was found that staff and boys exhibited communication traits that were consistent with their generation and consistent with other research in this field. It was also found that staff and boys preferred mobile and digital forms of communication over verbal announcements and the DRO system. For this reason, it was recommended that the Hilton College establish a system that took advantage of technology to improve on communication. Various recommendations were given by the researcher that took advantage of current technologies. These included the use of SMS, Instant Messaging, Social Networks and email. It was also recommended that the school consider prescribing devices that allow for communication between staff and boys...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to confirm the conformance rate of the actual usage of the clinical pathway (CP) using Electronic Health Record (EHR) log data in a tertiary general university hospital to improve the CP by reflecting realworld care processes. Methods: We analyzed the application and matching rates of clinicians’ orders with predefined CP order sets based on data from 164 inpatients who received appendectomies out of all patients who were hospitalized from August 2013 to June 2014. We collected EHR log data on patient information, medication orders, operation performed, diagnosis, transfer, and CP order sets. The data were statistically analyzed. Results: The average value of the actual application rate of the prescribed CP order ranged from 0. 75 to 0. 89. The application rate decreased when the order date was factored in along with the order code and type. Among CP pre-operation, intra-operation, post-operation, <b>routine,</b> and discharge <b>orders,</b> orders pertaining to operations had higher application rates than other types of <b>orders.</b> <b>Routine</b> <b>orders</b> and discharge orders had lower application rates. Conclusions: This analysis of the application and matching rates of CP orders suggests that it is possible to improve these rates by updating the existing CP <b>order</b> sets for <b>routine</b> discharge <b>orders</b> to reflect data-driven evidence. This study shows that it is possible to improve the application and matching rates of the CP using EHR log data. However, further research should be performed to analyze the effects of these rates on care outcomes. © 2015 The Korean Society of Medical Informaticsopen 0...|$|R

Our study is motivated by {{the experiences of the}} semiconductor and LCD industries, we investigate the impact of reciprocity in the dyadic supply chain. A notable characteristic in the above technology industries is the alternating possession of bargaining power caused by cyclical demand. We incorporate a reciprocal game in a dyadic supply channel over two periods. We investigate how a supplier is influenced and protects himself during the oversupply period by anticipating the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s reciprocal behavior. Our results show that a supplier 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of a buyer 2 ̆ 7 s reciprocal behavior can mitigate double marginalization and can even fully coordinate the channel. This implies that even without a costly mechanism to resolve the double marginalization, appropriate consideration of the counterpart will increase channel efficiency. ^ In the second essay, we consider a firm that manages a portfolio of customers placing orders that need replacement parts. The firm has both long-term and short-term customers. A long-term customer places both <b>routine</b> <b>orders</b> for <b>routine</b> maintenance and urgent orders due to emergency with a low margin for the firm and a short-term customer places urgent orders with a high margin for the firm. <b>Routine</b> <b>orders</b> provide stable loads and generate efficiency. Considering the increase in efficiency by <b>routine</b> <b>orders,</b> there is a trade-off between the efficiency and profitability of the order portfolio. Motivated by data provided by the company, we build an analytical model to support optimal decision making. We identify the impact of an additional urgent order to the cost embedded in the future operations. Finally, we model the mixed integer program to support the company 2 ̆ 7 s capacity plan. We conclude with in sights provided to the firm and managerial insights for optimal customer order portfolios. ^ In the third essay, we focus on the economic benefit of profound technology projects as milestones are achieved.

The project we use replaces the current aluminum (Al) alloy with Al-cerium (Ce) alloy in an engine block and an engine head to increase the operational efficiency of the vehicle. We can expect higher fuel efficiency as well as a lower cost of production. The Ce-Al alloy development project by the Critical Material Institute (CMI) announces an achievement level at every milestone. The model keeps track of two goals, efficiency improvement and production cost reduction. Based on the progress about those two R 2 ̆ 6 D tracks, the research question involves when to add capacity for production to maximize profits and how to adjust the R 2 ̆ 6 D strategy to maximize benefit. The problem is modeled in a Bayesian update and a stochastic dynamic program. Insights from the model were used to estimate the economic benefit for CMI and suggestion for improvement. ...|$|R
