5|$|The {{study of}} phase {{transition}} {{and the critical}} behavior of observables, termed critical phenomena, was a major field {{of interest in the}} 1960s. Leo Kadanoff, Benjamin Widom and Michael Fisher developed the ideas of critical exponents and widom scaling. These ideas were unified by Kenneth G. Wilson in 1972, under the formalism of the <b>renormalization</b> group in the context of quantum field theory.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{condensed}} matter physics {{involves the}} use of theoretical models to understand properties of states of matter. These include models to study the electronic properties of solids, such as the Drude model, the Band structure and the density functional theory. Theoretical models have also been developed to study the physics of phase transitions, such as the Ginzburg–Landau theory, critical exponents and the use of mathematical methods of quantum field theory and the <b>renormalization</b> group. Modern theoretical studies involve the use of numerical computation of electronic structure and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, topological phases, and gauge symmetries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} there is a {{bijection}} between the <b>renormalizations</b> and proper completely invariant closed sets of expanding Lorenz map, which enable us to distinguish periodic and non-periodic <b>renormalizations.</b> Based on the properties of periodic orbit of minimal period, the minimal completely invariant closed set is constructed. Topological characterizations of the <b>renormalizations</b> and α-limit sets are obtained via consecutive <b>renormalizations.</b> Some properties of periodic <b>renormalizations</b> are collected in Appendix. 1...|$|R
40|$|Let f be an {{orientation}} preserving homeomorphisms on the circle with several break points, that is, its derivative Df has jump discontinuities at these points. We study Rauzy-Veech <b>renormalizations</b> of piecewise smooth circle homeomorphisms, by considering such maps as generalized interval exchange maps with genus one. Suppose that Df is absolutely continuous on the each interval of continuity and DDf∈L_p for some p> 1. We prove that, under certain combinatorial assumptions on f, <b>renormalizations</b> R^n(f) are approximated by piecewise Möbus functions in C^ 1 +L_ 1 -norm, that means, R^n(f) are approximated in C^ 1 -norm and D^ 2 R^n(f) are approximated in L_ 1 -norm. In particular, if f has trivial product of size of breaks, then the <b>renormalizations</b> are approximated by piecewise affine interval exchange maps. Comment: 28 page...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that strong {{fluctuations}} preclude a hydrodynamic description of transport phenomena in helimagnets, such as MnSi, at T> 0. This breakdown of hydrodynamics {{is analogous to}} the one in chiral liquid crystals. Mode-mode coupling effects lead to infinite <b>renormalizations</b> of various transport coefficients, and the actual macroscopic description is nonlocal. At T= 0 these effects are weakened due to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, and the <b>renormalizations</b> remain finite. Observable consequences of these results, as manifested in the neutron scattering cross-section, are discussedComment: 4 pp., 1 eps figur...|$|R
25|$|<b>Renormalization</b> concepts, {{especially}} the <b>renormalization</b> group methods in quantum theories and statistical mechanics, {{have a long}} history and a very broad scope. The concepts of <b>renormalization</b> that appear useful in theories quantized in the front form of dynamics are essentially of two types, as in other areas of theoretical physics. The two types of concepts are associated with two types of theoretical tasks involved in applications of a theory. One task is to calculate observables (values of operationally defined quantities) in a theory that is unambiguously defined. The other task is to define a theory unambiguously. This is explained below.|$|E

40|$|We {{realize a}} {{dynamical}} decomposition for a post-critically finite rational map which admits a combinatorial decomposition. We split the Riemann sphere into two completely invariant subsets. One is {{a subset of}} the Julia set consisting of uncountably many Jordan curve components. Most of them are wandering. The other consists of components that are pullbacks of finitely many <b>renormalizations,</b> together with possibly uncountably many points. The quotient action on the decomposed pieces is encoded by a dendrite dynamical system. We also introduce a surgery procedure to produce post-critically finite rational maps with wandering Jordan curves and prescribed <b>renormalizations.</b> Comment: 49 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{quantum field}} {{theories}} require regularizations and infinite <b>renormalizations</b> due to ultraviolet divergences in their loop calculations. Furthermore, perturbation series in theories like QED are not convergent series, but are asymptotic series in their interaction couplings. We propose to apply neutrix calculus, developed by van der Corput and Hadamard {{in connection with}} asymptotic series, to tackle divergent integrals, yielding finite <b>renormalizations</b> for the parameters in quantum field theories.

25|$|The {{essence of}} {{asymptotic}} safety is {{the observation that}} nontrivial <b>renormalization</b> group fixed points {{can be used to}} generalize the procedure of perturbative <b>renormalization.</b> In an asymptotically safe theory the couplings {{do not need to be}} small or tend to zero in the high energy limit but rather tend to finite values: they approach a nontrivial UV fixed point. The running of the coupling constants, i.e. their scale dependence described by the <b>renormalization</b> group (RG), is thus special in its UV limit in the sense that all their dimensionless combinations remain finite. This suffices to avoid unphysical divergences, e.g. in scattering amplitudes. The requirement of a UV fixed point restricts the form of the bare action and the values of the bare coupling constants, which become predictions of the asymptotic safety program rather than inputs.|$|E

25|$|Summing {{over all}} {{possible}} oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity.
