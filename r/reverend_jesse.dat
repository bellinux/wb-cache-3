25|$|On December 21, 2007 Julia Carson's casket {{was taken}} to the Indiana Statehouse in {{downtown}} Indianapolis by horse-drawn military caisson. Carson became the ninth Hoosier to lie in repose at the Statehouse Rotunda. An early-morning service was held in the statehouse where Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels and Carson's grandson, City-County Councilman André Carson, gave remarks. Thousands of Hoosiers paid last respects to Carson by visiting the casket and attending an evening ceremony held in the Statehouse, including the <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Jackson, Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson (D), former U.S. Representative Andrew Jacobs, Jr., D-Ind., U.S. Representative Brad Ellsworth, D-Indiana, U.S. Representative Baron Hill, D-Indiana, U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, U.S. Representative Diane Watson, D-California, and former Gary, Indiana mayor Richard Hatcher.

25|$|Despite poor showings in the Iowa caucus (1.6%) and the New Hampshire primary (8%), Brown soon {{managed to}} win narrow {{victories}} in Maine, Colorado, Nevada, and Vermont, {{but he continued}} {{to be considered a}} small threat for much of the campaign. It was not until shortly after Super Tuesday, when the field had been narrowed to Brown, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, and front-runner then-Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, that Brown began to emerge as a major contender {{in the eyes of the}} press. On March 17, Brown forced Tsongas from the race when he received a strong third-place showing in the Illinois primary and then defeated the senator for second place in the Michigan primary by a wide margin. Exactly one week later, he cemented his position as a major threat to Clinton when he eked out a narrow win in the bitterly fought Connecticut primary. As the press focused on the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, which were both to be held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a gaffe: He announced to an audience of various leaders of New York City's Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider the <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Jackson as a vice-presidential candidate. Jackson, who had made a pair of anti-semitic comments about Jews in general, and New York City's Jews in particular, while running for president in 1984, was still mistrusted within the Jewish community. Jackson also had ties to Louis Farrakhan, infamous for his own anti-semitic statements, and with Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Brown's polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly to Bill Clinton in Wisconsin (37%–34%), and dramatically in New York (41%–26%).|$|E
500|$|Several {{days before}} the ceremony, activist group Rainbow Coalition, led by <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Jackson, planned a protest {{regarding}} African Americans and other racial minorities in the film industry. The group was voicing its objections to unflattering portrayals of minorities in film and television {{and the fact that}} minorities were underemployed in the entertainment industry. Jackson further pointed out the disparity in racial minorities in Hollywood by noting that Best Live Action Short Film nominee Dianne Houston was the only African American nominated that year. Although the group initially planned to demonstrate outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, an agreement between Jackson and producer Jones caused the protest to be moved adjacent to the broadcast facilities of the local ABC affiliate KABC-TV. Nevertheless, Jones remarked that the Academy Awards were not the appropriate venue for such protest declaring [...] "Why should the movie business be different from anything else in America? It's a problem that permeates everything in the country. Every facet of America discriminates." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hero" [...] {{has been}} covered several times through live performances, {{as well as}} {{recorded}} studio versions. Additionally, since its debut, it has achieved strong media attention. In 2009, prior to the election results, Barack Obama's wife Michelle played him the song to give him strength and inner support. A source close to Carey claimed that hearing the song's use {{meant a lot to}} her, saying [...] "She was blown away when she heard. She is so honoured to have played her part in such an occasion."

In 1994, Japanese singer Miho Nakayama released the song as a single with Japanese lyrics written by herself and became a big hit. American Idol season 5 contestant Heather Cox performed the song during the top 20 performances week, only to be voted off that night {{for not being able to}} successfully carry the song. Similarly, season 7 contestant Brooke White performed the song during the Mariah Carey themed week, while season 8 contestant Danny Gokey performed the song in the top 36 performances. season 10 contestant Karen Rodriguez performed the song in both English and Spanish versions in the top 24 performances, making it into the top 13 the following night. Japanese-American singer Yuna Ito included her rendition of [...] "Hero" [...] on her compilation album Love -Singles Best 2005–2010. Barbadian R singer Rihanna sang [...] "Hero" [...] during a live talent show at her high school in Barbados when she was 15. Soon after, she was signed by Jay-Z to Def Jam. The X Factor winner Melanie Amaro performed the song during the first season of the show, as a song chosen for her by the public. In 2013, Dami Im recorded a version for her album Dami Im. The album was #1 in Australia.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Jackson—who, {{prior to}} Obama's {{campaign}}, had come closer {{than any other}} African American to winning a major party's presidential nomination—said that the Obama campaign {{had been on the}} verge of being derailed by racial fear stemming from Wright's comments and previous remarks by Clinton supporter Geraldine Ferraro that Obama would not have come so far had he been white.

2500|$|Kronfield's remarks {{set off a}} wave of {{controversy}} when word of them reached the media in November. The <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Jackson became personally involved, publicly stating that PolyGram, based in the Netherlands, had [...] "a pattern of race and sex exclusion." [...] Jackson met with PolyGram chairman Alain Levy and several other executives, who issued a public apology for Kronfield's statement, and replaced Kronfield as president with Motown Records' chairman Clarence Avant. By {{the end of the}} month, Dru Hill had settled with Island Records, with the agreement that they would remain on the label.|$|E
2500|$|On June 12, 1806, Hanks married Thomas Lincoln at {{the home}} of Richard Berry in Beechland by <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Head.

2500|$|The first Presbyterian {{congregation}} in Redmond was organized in 1906, {{one year after}} the city was founded. [...] The church was established by <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> C. George under the authority and guidance of an existing Presbytery in Pendleton, Oregon. [...] The Pendleton Presbytery had sent Reverend George to Central Oregon in 1905 to minister to the Tumalo community fifteen miles southwest of Redmond.

Jones produced the highly successful The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (discovering Will Smith), UPN's In the House, and FOX's Madtv which ran for 14 seasons. In the early 1990s, Jones started a huge, ongoing project called [...] "The Evolution of Black Music."

2500|$|In May 2005, a {{controversy}} arose over comments Fox made {{during a meeting}} with Texas business people in which he said, [...] "There {{is no doubt that}} Mexicans, filled with dignity, willingness and ability to work, are doing jobs that not even blacks want to do there in the United States." [...] This angered African-Americans in the United States, prompting many black leaders to demand an apology from Fox. Reverend Al Sharpton requested a formal apology from Fox to the African-American community and called for an economic boycott of Mexican products until an apology was received. [...] Sharpton, along with many African-Americans felt that Fox's comments were insensitive and racist. <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Jackson, during a news conference concerning Fox's statement about African-Americans, said that he felt that the comments were, [...] "unwitting, unnecessary and inappropriate," [...] and added that [...] " [...] statement had the impact of being inciting and divisive." ...|$|E
2500|$|As co-owner, Bell {{undertook}} {{an ambitious}} program to make Stax {{not only a}} major recording company, but also a prominent force in the black community. [...] He began signing many more artists to the label, Frederick Knight and The Soul Children among them. For the first time, many of the label's acts began frequently recording at outside studios (such as Ardent Studios in Memphis and at recording studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama) and working with outside producers, signaling an end of the signature Stax sound. [...] Bell even created a comedy subsidiary label, Partee Records, which released albums {{from the likes of}} Richard Pryor and Moms Mabley; and he made a bid for the white pop market by signing Big Star and licensing albums by Terry Manning, the UK progressive rock band Skin Alley, and Lena Zavaroni. In addition, Bell became heavily involved with various causes in the African-American community, and was a close friend of the <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Jackson and a financial supporter of his Operation PUSH.|$|E
2500|$|Simon surged {{ahead in}} Iowa in October, and was, by December, the clear front-runner in that state. [...] However, in February 1988, Simon {{narrowly}} lost the Iowa caucus to Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri, and {{finished third in}} the New Hampshire primary the following week, with weak showings in Minnesota and South Dakota a week later. Out of money and momentum, Simon largely skipped the key Southern [...] "Super Tuesday" [...] primaries on March 8, concentrating on his home state a week later, where key local Democrats were running as Simon delegates on the delegate selection ballot, and wanted to attend the Democratic National Convention regardless of Simon's slim chance of winning the nomination. Simon won the Illinois primary, and decided to make a final effort in the Wisconsin Primary in early April, but dropped out after he finished behind Governor of Massachusetts Michael Dukakis, <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Jackson, and Tennessee Senator Albert Gore. Simon endorsed Dukakis, who won the Democratic nomination in July, with Jackson the last active challenger.|$|E
2500|$|He {{made his}} {{opinions}} on political matters known. On July 4, 1976 {{he started the}} New World Patriotism Day celebrations which were conducted on Independence Day in major cities across America. In 1984, Mohammed went against the mainstream African American political establishment and opposed <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Jackson's run for the Democratic nomination for President. In 1985, to protest the Chicago probate court handling of an American Muslim Mission case, he organized a [...] "Walk for Justice" [...] that drew 500,000 participants. On December 23, 1989 he spoke at the Annual Conference of the Islamic Committee for Palestine on {{the plight of the}} Palestinians. In 1990, Mohammed supported and endorsed Neil Hartigan for Governor of Illinois. He gave his support to the peacemaking and humanitarian efforts of Bishop Samuel Ruiz. On September 10, 1990 he participated in the international conference on the [...] "Current Situation in the Gulf", where he made his opposition to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a matter of public record. On behalf of the Muslim American Community, he donated $85,000 to Nelson Mandela to aid his efforts to end apartheid in South Africa during a personal meeting in Oakland, California on June 30, 1990. On September 11, 2001, he denounced the terrorist attacks as un-Islamic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary season}} began with U.S. Senator Tom Harkin winning his native Iowa as expected. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts won the New Hampshire primary on February 18, but Clinton's second-place finish, helped by his speech {{labeling}} himself [...] "The Comeback Kid," [...] energized his campaign. Jerry Brown won the Maine caucus and Bob Kerrey won South Dakota. Clinton {{won his first}} primary in Georgia. Tsongas won the Utah and Maryland primaries and a caucus in Washington. Harkin won caucuses in Idaho and Minnesota while Jerry Brown won Colorado. Bob Kerrey dropped out two days later. Clinton won the South Carolina and Wyoming primaries and Tsongas won Arizona. Harkin dropped out. Jerry Brown won the Nevada caucus. Clinton swept {{nearly all of the}} Super Tuesday primaries on March 10 making him the solid front runner. Clinton won the Michigan and Illinois primaries. Tsongas dropped out after finishing 3rd in Michigan. Jerry Brown, however, began to pick up steam, aided by using a 1–800 number to receive funding from small donors. Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut, Vermont and Alaska. As the race moved to the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, Brown had taken the lead in polls in both states. Then he made a serious gaffe by announcing to an audience of New York City's Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Jackson as a Vice Presidential candidate. Clinton won dramatically in New York (41%–26%) and closely in Wisconsin (37%–34%). Clinton then proceeded to win a long streak of primaries leading up to Jerry Brown's home state of California. Clinton won this primary 48% to 41% and secured the delegates needed to clinch the nomination.|$|E
