25|$|Some {{opponents of}} <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning</b> have {{concerns}} that technology {{is not yet}} developed enough to be safe - for example, {{the position of the}} American Association for the Advancement of Science , while others emphasize that <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning</b> could be prone to abuse (leading to the generation of humans whose organs and tissues would be harvested), and have concerns about how cloned individuals could integrate with families and with society at large.|$|E
25|$|Two {{commonly}} discussed {{types of}} theoretical human cloning are therapeutic cloning and <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning.</b> Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells {{from a human}} for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, as of 2014. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are somatic-cell nuclear transfer and, more recently, pluripotent stem cell induction. <b>Reproductive</b> <b>cloning</b> would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.|$|E
40|$|A 27 {{year old}}  clonal seed orchard of teak (Tectona grandis L. f) in Padangan, East Java {{comprising}} 24 clones, was evaluated for fertility, offspring diversity, and genetic drift. Flower and fruit productions {{were used to}} assess clone fertility in the orchard. Fertility variation measured as ‘sibling coefficient’ was found to be 1, 62, having high genetic diversity (0, 97) and low coancestry (0, 03). The clones varied in fertility in which,   25 % of the most fertile clones in the orchard contributed to 47, 5 % of flower and fruit yields. Effective population size in the orchard was 15, indicating that 15 of the clones contributed effectively to seed yield. Separating on the amounts of seeds that can be collected, individual collection, and proportional mixing of seed per clone might be useful in restricting over representation of highly <b>reproductive</b> <b>clones</b> thereby increasing genetic diversity in the seed crop. Another way to improve seed yield in the orchard is by increasing the effective population size. Thinning or prunning on highly <b>reproductive</b> <b>clones</b> might be useful in increasing effective population size...|$|R

25|$|This {{technique}} {{is currently the}} basis for cloning animals (such as the famous Dolly the sheep), and has been theoretically proposed as a possible way to clone humans. Using SCNT in <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning</b> has proven difficult with limited success. High fetal and neonatal death make the process very inefficient. Resulting cloned offspring are also plagued with development and imprinting disorders in non-human species. For these reasons, along with moral and ethical objections, <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning</b> in humans is proscribed in more than 30 countries. Most researchers believe that {{in the foreseeable future}} it will not be possible to use the current cloning technique to produce a human clone that will develop to term. It remains a possibility, though critical adjustments will be required to overcome current limitations during early embryonic development in human SCNT.|$|E
25|$|On January 14, 2001 the British {{government}} passed The Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Research Purposes) Regulations 2001 {{to amend}} the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 by extending allowable reasons for embryo research to permit research around stem cells and cell nuclear replacement, thus allowing therapeutic cloning. However, on November 15, 2001, a pro-life group won a High Court legal challenge, which struck down the regulation and effectively left all forms of cloning unregulated in the UK. Their hope was that Parliament would fill this gap by passing prohibitive legislation. Parliament was quick to pass the Human <b>Reproductive</b> <b>Cloning</b> Act 2001 which explicitly prohibited <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning.</b> The remaining gap with regard to therapeutic cloning was closed when the appeals courts reversed the previous decision of the High Court.|$|E
25|$|In bioethics, {{the ethics}} of cloning refers {{to a variety of}} ethical {{positions}} regarding the practice and possibilities of cloning, especially human cloning. While many of these views are religious in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by secular perspectives as well.

At the same time, many of the arguments for banning both forms of cloning are based on ignorance, myths, and speculation. It is extremely important to distinguish between <b>reproductive</b> and nonreproductive <b>cloning,</b> and it is equally important to distinguish among the various rationales for banning each.

25|$|One {{concern is}} that blastula {{creation}} in SCNT-based human stem cell research {{will lead to the}} <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning</b> of humans. Both processes use the same first step: the creation of a nuclear transferred embryo, most likely via SCNT. Those who hold this concern often advocate for strong regulation of SCNT to preclude implantation of any derived products for the intention of human reproduction, or its prohibition.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} no federal {{laws in the}} United States which ban cloning completely, and any such laws would raise difficult constitutional questions similar to {{the issues raised by}} abortion. Fifteen American states (Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Iowa, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, North Dakota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Florida, Georgia, and Virginia) ban <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning</b> and three states (Arizona, Maryland, and Missouri) prohibit use of public funds for such activities.|$|E
25|$|Organism cloning (also called <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning)</b> {{refers to}} the {{procedure}} of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants (see vegetative reproduction) and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There {{is a lot of}} ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation, has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.|$|E

50|$|Due to the Christian right's views {{regarding}} {{ethics and}} to an extent due to negative views of eugenics common to most ideologies in North America, it {{has worked for the}} regulation and restriction of certain applications of biotechnology.

The Christian right supports research with adult stem cells, amniotic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells which don't utilise cells from human embryos, as they view the harvesting of biological material from an embryo lacking the ability to give permission as an assault on a living being.|$|R
40|$|Clone structure, growth characteristics, and {{reproductive}} behaviour of individual ramets and clones were investigated over a three year period for Geonoma congesta, an abundant understory palm of the Atlantic lowland forest in Costa Rica. The 0. 6 ha study area contained 123 clones. Mean clone size was 7. 1 ramets; only 3 % of the clones sampled had > 20 ramets. Within a clone, new ramets are produced sporadically, 1 - 4 ramets at a time. Ramet mortality is {{often associated with}} physical damage from falling trees, lianas, and branches. Less than 30 % of the ramets with stems were erect. Ramets produced on average 10. 1 new leaves and abscised 9. 7 leaves in three years. Rates of leaf production and leaf abscission did not vary significantly among ramet stage classes. Stem elongation was greatest in shorter, younger ramets. In taller, older ramets, leaf size and number decreased over the study period. <b>Reproductive</b> <b>clones</b> comprised 64 % of the clones in 1986, whereas only 24 % of individual ramets reproduced. Ramets thast reproduced every year had significantly larger leaves and substantially greater crown leaf area than the other reproductive classes. Stage clases with the greatest frequency of reproduction exhibited the greatest decrease in both crown size and leaf size. Indidivual ramets live an average of 60 - 70 yr; clones may persist for ≥ 100 yr. The growth form of G. congesta ensures that clones persist despite a high incidence of ramet mortality and damage. At least one ramet within a clone is likely to reproduce every year, although individual ramets may not reproduce every year. Patterns of growth and reproduction are consistent with the hypothesis that the growth of young, deeply shaded sprouts is supplemented by production from older, taller stems. -from Autho...|$|R
25|$|On December 13, 2001, the United Nations General Assembly began elaborating an {{international}} convention against the <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning</b> of humans.

Costa Rica proposed the adoption of {{an international}} convention to ban all forms of human cloning. Unable to reach a consensus on a binding convention, in March 2005 a non-binding United Nations Declaration on Human Cloning, calling for the ban {{of all forms of}} human cloning contrary to human dignity, was adopted.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009, the US Congress voted {{whether to}} ban all human cloning, both {{reproductive}} and therapeutic (see Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act). Each time, {{divisions in the}} Senate, or an eventual veto from the sitting President (President George W. Bush in 2005 and 2007), over therapeutic cloning prevented either competing proposal (a ban on both forms or on <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning</b> only) from being passed into law. On March 10, 2010 a bill (HR 4808) was introduced with a section banning federal funding for human cloning. Such a law, if passed, would not have prevented research from occurring in private institutions (such as universities) that have both private and federal funding. However, the 2010 law was not passed.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the moral, ethical and legal aspects of <b>reproductive</b> human <b>cloning.</b> After examining {{the facts about}} cloning, this thesis tackles the difficult question of whether humans should be cloned. This is explored through an in-depth analysis of the moral and ethical acceptability of human cloning. The author concludes that human cloning should never be attempted and that consequently such a practice should be permanently prohibited by a legal norm. This thesis then surveys national legislation and international law {{to see if there}} presently exists a prohibition of human cloning. This thesis then examines possible future legal action regarding human cloning and suggests a legislative scheme. Finally, possible constitutional challenges to future Canadian legislation prohibiting human cloning are analyzed. This analysis focuses on the right to liberty and the right to security of the person entrenched in section 7 and the right to equality embodied in section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The author concludes that such challenges would likely be unsuccessful...|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} somatic cell nuclear {{transplant}} involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, {{known as the}} ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a somatic cell, referring to {{the cells of the}} human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a somatic cell and an unnucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the 'empty' ovum. After being inserted into the egg, the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell. The ovum, now containing the somatic cell's nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone). Stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning {{or in the case of}} <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning</b> the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term.|$|E
500|$|In the {{scientific}} community, <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning</b> refers {{only to the}} creation of a genetically identical living thing.

500|$|As {{opposed to}} the {{scientific}} definition of <b>reproductive</b> <b>cloning</b> which is simply {{the creation of a}} genetically identical living thing, Raëlians seek to both genetically clone individuals, rapidly accelerate growth of the clone to adulthood through a process like guided self-assembly of rapidly expanded cells or even nanotechnology and then transfer the mind and personality of the donor into the clone.
