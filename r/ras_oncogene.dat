40|$|Transplacental {{exposure}} of rats {{to a single}} dose of the direct acting carcinogen methylnitrosourea (MNU) results in the induction {{of a variety of}} neoplasias of neuroectodermal, epithelial, and mesenchymal origin. Molecular analysis of the oncogenes present in these tumors revealed a striking degree of tissue specificity. neu oncogenes were found to be reproducibly activated in tumors derived from the peripheral nervous system (PNS), but not in those arising from the central nervous system (CNS). No <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> were found in either PNS- or CNS-derived tumors. However, Ha-ras oncogenes were detected in each of three mammary carcinomas and Ki-ras oncogenes were present in each of five kidney mesenchymal tumors. These results illustrate that phenotypic expression of activated oncogenes in vivo is not a random process and suggest that normal developmental programs may {{play an important role in}} modulating the activation of specific oncogenes by chemical carcinogens. PCR analysis revealed that each of the <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> detected in these transplacentally induced tumors became activated by the same G [...] A transition in the second base of codon 12. Since G [...] A transitions are the preferred mutations induced by MNU, it is likely that these <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> may have been directly targeted by MNU during embryonic development...|$|R

Southern and Northern experiments in concert with tumorigenicity assays show that the malignant transformation of these cells by mutant <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> is a gradual but reversible process {{that depends on the}} relative abundance of oncogene sequences and their corresponding transcripts.

To verify {{the role played}} by N-ras in thyroid carcinogenesis, we generated transgenic mice in which a human N-ras(Gln 61 Lys) oncogene (Tg-N-ras) was expressed in the thyroid follicular cells. Tg-N-ras mice developed thyroid follicular neoplasms; 11 % developed follicular adenomas and approximately 40 % developed invasive follicular carcinomas, in some cases with a mixed papillary/follicular morphology. About 25 % of the Tg-N-ras carcinomas displayed large, poorly differentiated areas, featuring vascular invasion and forming lung, bone or liver distant metastases. N-ras(Gln 61 Lys) expression in cultured PC Cl 3 thyrocytes induced thyroid-stimulating hormone-independent proliferation and genomic instability with micronuclei formation and centrosome amplification.

Point mutations represent a well-defined target for antisense oligonucleotides that can specifically suppress the translation of the targeted mutant mRNA. We show that the stability and cellular disponibility of antisense oligonucleotides can be markedly improved by adsorption to polyalkylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles. Nanoparticle-adsorbed antisense oligonucleotides directed to a point mutation (G [...] >U) in codon 12 of the Ha-ras mRNA selectively inhibited the proliferation of cells expressing the point-mutated Ha-ras gene at a concentration 100 times lower than free oligonucleotides. In addition they markedly inhibited Ha-ras-dependent tumor growth in nude mice after subcutaneous injection. These experiments show that inhibition of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> by antisense oligonucleotides can block tumor development even though ras oncogenic activation might be an early event in tumor progression...|$|R

40|$|Background: Chromium {{carcinogenicity}} and mutagenicity are {{no longer}} disputed. However, although chromium has various genetic effects that induce cancer, its mechanism of inducing lung cancer in humans is still not fully understood. p 53, a tumor suppressor gene, {{was found to be}} infrequently mutated in samples of lung cancer in workers with long occupational exposure to chromium, suggesting other cancer-related genes to be targeted in such tumors. Methods: To assess the contribution of the <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> in the pathogenesis of chromate-related lung cancer, we studied point mutations at the critical positions of codons 12, 13, and 61 of the Ha-ras and Ki-ras oncogenes in 38 lung cancer samples derived from Japanese patients who worked in the chromate industry for long periods. We used both radioactive isotope and non-radioisotope PCR-SSCP techniques. Results: The results of this study demonstrated that activation of ras genes due to point mutations in chromate-related lung cancer is a rare event.

40|$|Activation of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> {{is found}} in human cancers; overall it is {{observed}} in 15 % of all neoplasms. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the extent of involvement of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> in osteosarcoma. Tumor samples from a series of 49 pediatric patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma and treated at our institution were evaluated. Paraffin-embedded tumor samples from diagnostic biopsies, from tumor en bloc resection tissue after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and samples from metastases were examined in search of point mutations in H, K, and N-ras genes at codons 12 and 61 by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), slot-blotting, and radioactive labeled specific DNA probes. A total of 92 archival samples were studied. No point mutations activating these genes were found. These findings suggest that the activation by point mutations at codons 12 and 61 of the H, K, and N-ras genes does not play a role in the pathogenesis of human osteosarcoma. Since no point mutations in codons 12 and 61 were detected, it was not possible to establish any correlation between the ras genes and clinical or histologic finding...|$|R

Marked common decreases {{in the content}} of GD 3 ganglioside and the increase of its metabolic precursor GM 3 were bound in BALB/ 3 T 3 cell lines transformed by either K- or H- <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes.</b> Moreover, a common decrease or loss in the contents of "A " series ganglio-tetraose gangliosides such as GM,a and GDia was also found in all transformed cell lines, indicating that the alteration of cellular glycosphingolipids by <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> apparently does not depend on the type of ras-concogenes (K- and H-ras).

40|$|The {{frequency}} of ras (H-, K-, and N-ras) and c-myc oncogenes {{was investigated in}} multiple myeloma (MM). By means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) /oligonucleotide hybridization method, DNA from 56 tumor biopsies was analyzed {{for the presence of}} activating mutations involving codons 12 and 61 of the H-, K-, and N-ras genes and codon 13 of the N-ras gene. Mutations, involving the N- or K-ras genes, were detected in 18 of 56 (32 %) cases of which 12 / 43 (27 %) were at diagnosis and 6 / 13 (46 %) were after treatment. In some cases, multiple mutations affecting different ras alleles were detected. Direct nucleotide sequence analysis of PCR products indicated that a more heterogeneous nature of the base pair changes than previously shown for other tumors along with a preferential involvement of N-ras codon 61. The heterogeneity of MM cases with respect to the presence of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> prompted an analysis of possible correlations with different clinico- pathologic characteristics of MM from which a correlation between the presence of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> and a partial or complete lack of response to therapy emerged. The {{frequency of}} activating rearrangements or mutations of the c-myc gene were studied by Southern blot analysis and PCR sequencing, respectively. However, contrary to previous reports involving mostly MM cell lines, no structural alterations of the c-myc gene were found. These results indicate that ras, but not c-myc, oncogenes are activated in vivo in MM cells, representing the first oncogene alteration that has been associated at appreciable frequency with this type of malignancy. While the mechanism of occurrence and biological role of ras activation in MM remains to be elucidated, the preliminary correlations observed in this study between the presence of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> and poor therapeutic response suggest that further investigations of the possible prognostic significance of these alterations are necessary...|$|R
40|$|Activated <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> {{have been}} {{detected}} {{in a variety of}} human malignancies. Activation of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> usually occurs by point mutations within specific codons of the H-ras, N-ras, and K-ras genes. For the present study, DNA was isolated from 30 basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and 12 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). After amplification of genomic DNA by using the polymerase chain reaction, the occurrence of point mutations was investigated with 32 P-labeled synthetic oligonucleotides. These probes are complementary to the known point-mutated nucleotide sequences of the ras genes. In four out of the 30 BCC studied, point mutations were detected at codon 12 of the K-ras gene and at codon 61 of the H-ras gene. The K-ras mutations involve glycine to cysteine and glycine to asparagine amino acid changes. The mutation at codon 61 of the H-ras gene is consistent with a replacement of glutamine by histidine. In one SCC, a point mutation was detected at codon 12 of the K-ras gene, involving a glycine to cysteine substitution in the gene product. These findings demonstrate that mutational activation of ras genes takes place in skin carcinomas, but the rate at which these mutations occur seems to be relatively low...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} functional {{relationships between}} oncogenes and growth factors, {{we compared the}} effects of transfected myc and <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> on the responsiveness of Fischer rat 3 T 3 cells to three growth factors: epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Control cells did not grow in soft agar under any conditions. ras-Transfected cells grew in soft agar under all conditions tested and were insensitive to the stimulatory effects of exogenous growth factors. These cells secreted elevated levels of both EGF-like factors and TGF-beta, suggesting {{that the lack of}} responsiveness of these cells to exogenous growth factors arose from autocrine stimulation. myc-Transfected cells displayed conditional anchorage-independent growth: they formed numerous colonies in soft agar in the presence of EGF but relatively few colonies in the presence of PDGF or TGF-beta. Secretion of EGF-like factors and TGF-beta by these cells was not elevated above that of control cells. These results suggest a model for the mechanism of cooperation between myc and <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> in which ras-like genes induce growth factor production, while myc-like genes increase the responsiveness of cells to these factors...|$|R

40|$|Transformation with <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> {{results in}} {{increased}} radiation sur vival in many {{but not all}} cells. In addition, prenyltransferase inhibitors which inhibit ras proteins by blocking posttranslational modification radiosensitize cells with oncogenic ras. These findings suggest that oncogenic ras contributes to intrinsic radiation resistance. However, because introduction of <b>ras</b> <b>oncogenes</b> does not increase radiation survival in all cells and because prenyltransferase inhibitors target molecules other than ras, these studies left the conclusion that ras increases the intrinsic radi ation resistance of tumor cells in doubt. Here we show that genetic inactivation of K- or N-ras oncogenes in human tumor cells (DLD- 1 and HT 1080, respectively) leads to increased radiosensitivity. Reintroduction of the activated N-ras gene into the HT 1080 line, having lost its mutant allele, resulted in increased radiation resistance. This study lends further support to the hypothesis that expression of activated ras can contribute to intrinsic radiation resistance in human tumor cells and extends this finding to the K- and N- members of the ras family. These findings support the development of strategies that target ras for inactivation {{in the treatment of}} cancer...|$|R

50|$|NF-1 is a {{microdeletion}} syndrome {{caused by}} a mutation of a gene located on chromosomal segment 17q11.2 on the long arm of chromosome 17 which encodes a protein known as neurofibromin (not {{to be confused with}} the disorder itself) which plays a role in cell signaling. The Neurofibromin 1 gene is a negative regulator of the <b>Ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> signal transduction pathway. It stimulates the GTPase activity of Ras. It shows greater affinity for RAS p21 protein activator 1, but lower specific activity. The mRNA for this gene is subject to RNA editing (CGA->UGA->Arg1306Term) resulting in premature translation termination.

50|$|Downward's {{research}} investigates cancer biology. His {{work on the}} Ras GTPase {{has made}} seminal contributions {{to our understanding of}} how cellular signal transduction pathways are subverted in oncogenic transformation. His work provided the first demonstration that Guanosine triphosphate-loading on Ras, which is commonly mutationally activated in human tumours, is normally regulated in response to extracellular factors; he went on to characterise growth factor receptor complexes mediating Ras nucleotide exchange, and to demonstrate that GTP-bound Ras binds to and activates the RAF kinase, which controls the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Julian was first to demonstrate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is also a Ras effector, important in regulation of apoptosis. He showed that transformation by Ras requires interaction with multiple effectors, which contribute differentially to cell cycle progression, cytoskeletal regulation and apoptosis. His work has established that both cell matrix and cell-cell interaction activate the PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway, and thereby prevent programmed cell death, and that it is activation of this pathway by oncogenic Ras that allows anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells. Most recently he has focused on identifying unique weaknesses of cancer cells expressing the activated <b>Ras</b> <b>oncogene</b> using a combination of large-scale functional genomics and pre-clinical models of lung cancer.|$|E
50|$|The E6/E7 {{proteins}} inactivate two tumor suppressor proteins, p53 (inactivated by E6) and pRb (inactivated by E7).The viral oncogenes E6 and E7 {{are thought}} to modify the cell cycle so as to retain the differentiating host keratinocyte {{in a state that}} is favourable to the amplification of viral genome replication and consequent late gene expression. E6 in association with host E6-associated protein, which has ubiquitin ligase activity, acts to ubiquitinate p53, leading to its proteosomal degradation. E7 (in oncogenic HPVs) acts as the primary transforming protein. E7 competes for retinoblastoma protein (pRb) binding, freeing the transcription factor E2F to transactivate its targets, thus pushing the cell cycle forward. All HPV can induce transient proliferation, but only strains 16 and 18 can immortalize cell lines in vitro. It has also been shown that HPV 16 and 18 cannot immortalize primary rat cells alone; there needs to be activation of the <b>ras</b> <b>oncogene.</b> In the upper layers of the host epithelium, the late genes L1 and L2 are transcribed/translated and serve as structural proteins that encapsidate the amplified viral genomes. Once the genome is encapsidated, the capsid appears to undergo a redox-dependent assembly/maturation event, which is tied to a natural redox gradient that spans both suprabasal and cornified epithelial tissue layers. This assembly/maturation event stabilizes virions, and increases their specific infectivity. Virions can then be sloughed off in the dead squames of the host epithelium and the viral lifecycle continues. A 2010 study has found that E6 and E7 are involved in beta-catenin nuclear accumulation and activation of Wnt signaling in HPV-induced cancers.|$|E
