In contrast to earlier works, {{we assume that the}} inventory on the producing stage is depleted at discrete time intervals, and analyse the effect of a variable production rate on the inventory build-up and the total costs of the system. We develop formal models for the case of equal- and unequal-sized batch shipments and propose solution procedures for the models. In a numerical study, we illustrated that deviating from the “design production rate” of a production system may <b>reduce</b> <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>costs</b> and thus lead to lower total costs...|$|E
40|$|The MIDAS {{system that}} we have {{developed}} is an automated supply chain management system based on the Service Oriented Architecture and Web Services. MIDAS provides a loosely-coupled distributed environment that allows customers, manufacturers, and suppliers to cooperate over the Internet and World Wide Web. It aims to <b>reduce</b> <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>costs</b> and logistics administration costs, yielding a more efficient supply chain, by supporting just-in-time manufacturing. It eliminates, or substantially reduces, human intervention on both the customer/manufacturer side and the manufacturer/supplier side. It allows a manufacturer to select, dynamically from the MIDAS Registry, suppliers of components, based on the price, availability, and delivery time of those components. A manufacturer can use one of several strategies to aggregate customers ’ orders before it processes them and to accumulate suppliers ’ quotes before it decides on a particular supplier. The use of a Service Oriented Architecture, such as MIDAS, can substantially improve the efficiency of a supply chain. ...|$|E
40|$|Serial {{production}} lines {{are widely used}} in production systems. Balancing the capacities {{of a group of}} machines and connecting them by a common transfer mechanism constitutes a transfer line. Generally, the term transfer line represents a synchronized serial production line where the output from each production stage is equal to the output of the line. Because the stages are tightly linked together, loss of production due to breakdowns or defective items at any stage can temporarily stop the entire line. Consequently, transfer lines often have low efficiences. However, efficiency can be increased by adding safety inventories to decouple the stages. This paper presents a model and procedures for determining the safety inventories needed at each stage to assure that a prespecified transfer line efficiency is met and that the minimum amount of safety inventory is used. To <b>reduce</b> <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>costs,</b> larger inventories are arranged near the beginning of the line where the unit costs are lower than {{at the end of the}} line. Examples illustrate a solution procedure which is applicable to large transfer lines and can accommodate any theoretical or empirical probability distribution for breakdowns and production of defective items. transfer lines safety inventory inventory control machine breakdowns...|$|E

But in uncertain environment, when the lead-time of acquisition is highly variable, {{we have to keep}} safety stock of such items. Kanban is one of the Major elements of Lean manufacturing System. It supports the Just-In-Time Manufacturing. There are various types of production control techniques including Kanban control, which authorized the production on pull basis.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyses}} {{the choice}} between different transport modes, based {{on the concept of}} total logistics costs. Not only the cost of transportation itself is considered, but also all the other costs that arise in the supply chain, such as the costs of goods handling, the <b>costs</b> of <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying,</b> etc. In a first case-study, based on real-market data, {{the choice between}} road haulage and inland navigation is analysed for an annual volume of 55. 000 tonnes of bulk goods. In this case-study the trade-off between transport <b>costs</b> and <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>costs</b> is shown: inland navigation has lower transport <b>costs,</b> but its <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>costs</b> are higher. Due {{to the fact that the}} bulk goods considered have a low value, leading to low <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>costs,</b> inland navigation turns out to be the cheapest transport mode from the viewpoint of total logistics costs. It is shown that for goods with a significantly higher value (and thus larger <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>costs),</b> the difference in total logistics costs between both transport modes becomes very small. In a second case-study, a comparison is made between rail transport, inland navigation and road haulage for a volume of 80. 000 tonnes of bulk goods per year. Both rail transport and inland navigation require precarriage and/or oncarriage by truck, as well as goods handling. This increases the transport costs of both modes considerably. As a result, road haulage turns out to be the cheapest transport mode from the viewpoint of the total logistics costs. However, when a larger ship type can be deployed than the one currently used, the balance turns in favour of inland navigation...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} tasks in a job shop manufacturing environment is to balance schedule and capacity in an ongoing basis. MRP systems are commonly used for scheduling, although their inability to deal with capacity constraints adequately is a severe drawback. In this study, we show that material requirements planning can be done more effectively in a job shop environment using a resource constrained project scheduling model. The proposed model augments MRP models by incorporating capacity constraints and using variable lead time lengths. The efficacy of this approach is tested on MRP systems by comparing the <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>costs</b> and resource allocation of the solutions obtained by the proposed model to those obtained by using a traditional MRP model.

This study explores the relationship between component-level resilience and system-level resilience {{with the aim of}} identifying policies which foster system-level resilience in situations where existing incentives might undermine it. We use an abstract model of interacting specialized resource users and producers which can be parameterized to represent specific real systems. We want to understand how features, such as stockpiles, influence system versus component resilience. Systems are subject to perturbations of varying intensity and frequency. For our study, we create a simplified economy in which an <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>cost</b> is imposed to incentivize smaller inventories and examine how components with varying inventory levels compete in environments subject to periods of resource scarcity.

40|$|In a {{production}} environment, quality levels vary owing to various operational constraints. In an operational environment, the total relevant cost includes (i) production time cost, (ii) manufacturing facility setup <b>cost</b> and (iii) <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>cost.</b> Production time cost {{relates to the}} time for which a manufacturing facility runs. Setup cost {{is concerned with the}} expenditure incurred in arranging a facility to produce certain item. This is irrespective of the production quantity in one setup. <b>Inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>cost</b> is estimated on the basis of an average inventory held in the system. Additionally a shortage cost is also incorporated in cases where the shortages are allowed. Variation in the quality level will affect the costs. Sometimes a decision has to be taken by either manufacturer or supplier to allow for high quality defects. These should be on the basis of certain principles/policies. Modifications are often made in the design of products so that the quality problems are less. Such design/development project costs the company and a decision is to be taken whether it is justified. The present paper develops certain policies which will be useful in supporting the decisions related to quality level. A strategic framework concerning supplier categorization/selection is also discussed. Few relevant propositions are further developed after providing a basic structure for their generation.

40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} environmental concerns, {{costs of}} raw materials, and stricter government regulations {{have resulted in}} companies striving to reduce their waste materials. An earlier approach adopted was the recycling of materials such as waste paper, glass and metals. However, recycled products typically lose {{a portion of their}} added values. Different waste reduction options such as direct reuse, repair, refurbishing, cannibalization, and remanufacturing were studied to overcome this drawback. Remanufacture recaptures the value added to materials when a product was first manufactured. In the aerospace industry, where safety and performance are the overriding concerns and repairs are highly regulated, it could be perceived that remanufacturing has minimal appeal. However, the very low design tolerance of manufactured components results in a high percentage of defects. Due to the high price of raw materials, remanufacturing and components saving through “transforming” could be applied in imperfect production systems {{to reduce the amount of}} scrap materials. In this thesis, a general model is first proposed for a closed-loop supply chain network which includes the following processes: repairs, remanufacturing and transforming of selected defective components and end-of-life products, and cannibalization. A mixed integer linear programming formulation is developed to investigate the effect of various factors on profit, <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>cost,</b> and number of scrap components. Uncertainty in demand and lead-time is one of the major issues in any manufacturing supply chain. Uncertainty is incorporated into an extended model through the scenario-analysis approach and outsourcing is considered as an option for remanufacturing of the customer owned components. Demand of final products is assumed to be deterministic. The defect rate of disassembled components, however, is considered to be variable which makes the demand for spares to be variable. The lead-time of in-house remanufacturing of the customer owned components is also considered to be variable. Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effect of capacity, <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>cost,</b> outsourcing cost, lead-time, and defect rate variation on profit and amount of scraps. The <b>inventory</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>cost</b> variations have direct effect on the inventory turnover ratio. The maximum capacity of the outsourced company and process costs per unit have significant effect on the profitability. Maintaining a long-term relationship with third-party service providers, designing the components with a longer life cycle, and transforming and remanufacturing of defective components directly impact the profitability over the life cycle of a product. ...|$|R
