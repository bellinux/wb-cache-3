500|$|Hooper {{reportedly}} {{hoped that}} the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) would give the complete, uncut <b>release</b> <b>print</b> a [...] "PG" [...] rating due to its minimal amount of visible gore.

In San Francisco, cinema-goers walked out of theaters in disgust and, in February 1976, two theaters in Ottawa, Canada, were advised by local police to withdraw the film lest they face morality charges.|$|E

500|$|Hall's {{approach}} {{was to create}} peaceful compositions that evoked classicism, to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events and allow audiences {{to take in the}} action. Hall and Mendes first discussed the intended mood of a scene, but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary. In most cases, Hall first lit the scene's subject by [...] "painting in" [...] the blacks and whites, before adding fill light, which he reflected from beadboard or white card on the ceiling. This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill. Hall shot American Beauty in a [...] in the Super 35 format, using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 35mm film stock. He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal-filled pool in its overhead shot, creating a frame around Angela within. He shot the whole film at the same T-stop (T1.9); given his preference for shooting that wide, Hall favored high-speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects. He used Panavision Platinum cameras with the company's Primo series of prime and zoom lenses. Hall employed Kodak Vision 200T 5274 and EXR 5248 stock for scenes with daylight effects. He had difficulty adjusting to Kodak's newly introduced Vision <b>release</b> <b>print</b> stock, which, combined with his contrast-heavy lighting style, created a look with too much contrast. Hall contacted Kodak, who sent him a batch of 5279 that was 5% lower in contrast. Hall used a 1/8inch Tiffen Black ProMist filter for almost every scene, which he said in retrospect {{may not have been the}} best choice, as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its anamorphic <b>release</b> <b>print</b> led to a slight amount of degradation; therefore, the diffusion from the filter was not required. When he saw the film in a theater, Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter, the diffusion from the Super 35–anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{completion}} of The Return of the King, Weta Workshop and Weta Digital, supervised by Taylor, Rivers, and Joe Lettieri, started pre-production on King Kong. Jackson brought back most of the crew he had on The Lord of the Rings series, including cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, production designer Grant Major, art directors Simon Bright and Dan Hennah, conceptual designer Alan Lee, and editor Jamie Selkirk. Jackson, Walsh and Boyens began to write a new script in late October 2003. Jackson acknowledged that he was highly unsatisfied with the original 1996 script. [...] "That was actually just Fran and Peter very hurriedly getting something down on paper", Boyens explained. [...] "It was more one of many possible ways the story could go." [...] The writers were adamant to base the new script on the 1933 film, rather than the 1996 script. They also included scenes that were either uncompleted or entirely omitted from James Ashmore Creelman's original script in the cutting room floor. In the scene where Kong shakes the surviving sailors pursuing Ann and himself from a log into the ravine, it was originally the intention of directors Merian Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack to feature giant spiders emerging from the rock to devour their bodies. This was cut from the original <b>release</b> <b>print,</b> and remains known to Kong fans only via a rare still that appeared in Famous Monsters of Filmland. Jackson included this scene and elaborated upon it. Jackson, Walsh and Boyens also cited Delos W. Lovelace's 1932 novelization of King Kong as inspiration, which included the character Lumpy (Andy Serkis). To make the relationship between Ann Darrow and Kong plausible, the writers studied hours of gorilla footage. Jackson also optioned Early Havoc, a memoir written by vaudeville performer June Havoc to help Walsh and Boyens flesh out Ann Darrow's characterization. Carl Denham was intentionally modeled after and inspired by Orson Welles. Their new draft was finished in February 2004.|$|E

As a consequence, the film has never been officially released on video or DVD in the U.S., however bootleg DVD-Rs, made from a 35mm anamorphic [...] "E-K" [...] <b>release</b> <b>print,</b> circulate among collectors, preserving 115 minutes of the original 138-minute whole.|$|E

Monte Carlo (1930) was another highly regarded Lubitsch classic, with British musical star Jack Buchanan as a count who disguises himself as a hairdresser to woo a scatterbrained countess (Macdonald). MacDonald introduced [...] "Beyond the Blue Horizon" [...] which she recorded three times during her career.|$|E
2500|$|Hopper {{was unable}} to {{capitalize}} on his Easy Rider success for several years. In 1970 he filmed The Last Movie, cowritten by Stewart Stern and photographed by Laszlo Kovacs in Peru, and completed production in 1971. It won the prestigious CIDALC Award at that year's Venice Film Festival, but Universal Studios leaders expected a blockbuster like Easy Rider, and {{did not like the}} film or give it an enthusiastic release, while American film audiences found it confounding - as convoluted as an abstract painting. On viewing the first <b>release</b> <b>print,</b> fresh from the lab, in his screening room at Universal, MCA founder Jules Stein rose from his chair and said, [...] "I just don't understand this younger generation." [...] During the tumultuous editing process, Hopper ensconced himself at the Mabel Dodge Luhan House in Taos, New Mexico, which he had purchased in 1970, for almost an entire year. In between contesting Fonda's rights to the majority of the residual profits from Easy Rider, he married Michelle Phillips in October 1970.|$|E

2500|$|The editing {{of the car}} chase by Frank P. Keller likely won Keller {{the editing}} Oscar for 1968, and has been {{included}} in lists of the [...] "Best Editing Sequences of All-Time". Paul Monaco has written, [...] "The most compelling street footage of 1968, however, appeared in an entirely contrived sequence, with nary a hint of documentary feel about it – the car chase {{through the streets of}} San Francisco in Bullitt, created from footage shot over nearly five weeks. Billy Fraker, the cinematographer for the film, attributed the success of the chase sequence primarily to the work of the editor, Frank P. Keller. At the time, Keller was credited with cutting the piece in such a superb manner that he made the city of San Francisco a [...] "character" [...] in the film." [...] The editing of the scene was not without difficulties; Ralph Rosenblum wrote in 1979 that [...] "those who care about such things may know that during the filming of the climactic chase scene in Bullitt, an out-of-control car filled with dummies tripped a wire which prematurely sent a costly set up in flames, and that editor Frank Keller salvaged the near-catastrophe with a clever and unusual juxtaposition of images that made the explosion appear to go off on time." [...] This chase scene has also been cited by critics as groundbreaking in its realism and originality. In the <b>release</b> <b>print</b> and the print shown for many years, a scene in which the Charger actually hits the camera causing a red flare on screen, which many feel added to the realism, was edited out on DVD prints to the disappointment of many fans.|$|E
