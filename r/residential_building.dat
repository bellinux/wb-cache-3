5|$|Other {{downtown}} projects {{include the}} renovation of the Old Post Office, which started in 1998 and was completed in 2006. The Old Post Office and seven adjacent buildings had been vacant since the early 1990s; as of 2010 this complex included a variety of tenants, including {{a branch of the}} St. Louis Public Library, a branch of Webster University, the St. Louis Business Journal, and a variety of government offices. The renovation of the Old Post Office spurred development of an adjacent plaza, which is linked to a new $80 million <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> called Roberts Tower, the first new residential construction in downtown St. Louis since the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The Cummer Museum {{acquired}} the Barnett {{building in the}} early 1990s, remodeling the first floor into the museum’s education center, Art Connections, and using the second floor for administrative offices. The two buildings were connected by the Barnett Concourse, and two more major galleries were added. This expansion was completed in 1992. In early 2002, the museum {{acquired the}} adjacent Woman's Club of Jacksonville, a Tudor-style <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> which {{would serve as a}} space for programs and events for the museum.

5|$|The Helix has {{traditionally}} been known for offering {{a panoramic view of}} the New York skyline. While local zoning laws prohibit the construction of high-rise buildings that would obstruct sight-lines from higher points in town, as of June 2013 construction of a new <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> partially blocked the view from the lower portion of the roadway. As of 2015, the Helix is considered by the PANYNJ to have a working life-span of ten years. Alternatives to its replacement include tunnels under the Palisades directly to the Lincoln Tunnel portals.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1921 and spurred {{a new wave}} of {{development}} in South Jacksonville. New subdivisions were platted in Oklahoma and Villa Alexandria, including South Shores, Alexandria Place, River Oaks, and the original San Marco development, while the old Red Bank plantation became South Riverside and Colonial Manor. The 1857 the Red Bank Plantation House became a residence in the Colonial Manor neighborhood that grew around it; it is Jacksonville's second oldest <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> still in use. The bridge triggered economic development in South Jacksonville as well, though it greatly reduced the ferry business, which disappeared entirely within twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The scheme has {{attracted}} criticism from various sources, and certain aspects and proposals {{have been particularly}} controversial. A planned 42-storey hotel and <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> on one block—which {{was not in the}} original plan and for which planning permission was later denied—was opposed by many local people and politicians, and was eventually rejected by a government minister on appeal. The decision to allow a large supermarket branch to be built {{in the middle of the}} development was also unpopular. A campaign group was formed to co-ordinate and raise the awareness of people's concerns.|$|E
40|$|The {{serviceability}} and comfortability of {{a building}} edifice are functions of its facilities and materials of construction. The level of facilities and quality of materials determine the degree of comfort, satisfaction and comfortability the users of <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> will enjoy. The study assessed the level of facilities and materials specification of <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> in Nigeria. Data were collected through questionnaire administered on the users of <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> in the study area. The study {{found out that the}} facilities available in most of the <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> are water closet and ceiling fan. Moreover, materials mostly used in construction were asbestos ceiling board, emulsion paint, floor screed among others. The study concluded that <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> in the study area were built with the basic facilities and materials for construction. The study therefore recommends the need for both the government and private players in housing to formulate policy to enforce a minimum standard of facilities and materials specification in <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> as essential need of man. This will eliminate the possibility of environmental challenges such as water and household-waste pollutions which could arise from non-availability of basic facilities and thereby improve the living conditions of the users...|$|R

5|$|P Associates {{received}} {{final approval}} from the city zoning board and the historical commission in August 1999, but continued to seek more financing, which {{it was able to}} secure from Corus Bank of Chicago in September 2001. To develop the tower, now called The St. James, P Associates formed the St. James Associates Joint Venture with Clark Realty Capital LLC and Lend Lease Real Estate Investments, which represented an undisclosed client. With financial backing from its partners and tax breaks for new residential construction passed in 2000, construction began on November 28, 2001. BACE Construction (Philadelphia based) was awarded the construction of the project. Philadelphia had not seen any residential high-rise development since the 1980s, and The St. James {{was one of the first}} to begin construction in the city, preceded only by the 16-story Residences at the Dockside, which broke ground in 2000. It became the largest <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> in the city.|$|E

5|$|Grayanotoxin {{is named}} after him. William Hooker named the genus Grayia after Gray. The Asa Gray Award, awarded by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists, was {{established}} in 1984 to honor a living botanist for career achievements. Gray has two namesake buildings at Harvard University: the Asa Gray House, which is a National Historic Landmark, and the Gray Herbarium. A <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> {{is named after}} him on the Stony Brook University campus. Two mountain peaks are named after him: Gray Peak in New York and Grays Peak in Colorado. The latter is near Torreys Peak, named after his mentor and friend John Torrey. In 2011 the US Postal Service released an Asa Gray first-class postage stamp {{as part of its}} American Scientists series, along with Melvin Calvin, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, and Severo Ochoa. This was the third volume of this series. It features Shortia galacifolia, a flowering plant that fascinated Gray. A street named after Asa Gray is home to the University Commons of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Asa Gray Park in Lake Helen, Florida, is named in his honor.|$|E

5|$|Structure C8 is a {{residential}} compound that was accessed from the alley {{running to the}} East Plaza from behind Pyramid C1. The entrance opened onto the alley from a patio situated in the southern portion of the compound. This patio was surrounded on the east, west and north sides by rooms, with the alley to the south. It was floored with stucco and Structure C8 was the only stuccoed <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> {{in the whole of}} the city. The north range of rooms backed directly onto the ravine immediately to the north of Group C; the lower portion of the walls of the west room and of half of the north room still stand. The west room was square while the north room was narrow and probably extended the entire width of the patio. Wear marks in the stucco floor indicate that a door once accessed the north room from the west. The workmanship of Structure C8 was of very high quality and indicates that it was the residence of a member of the city's elite. Its proximity to the large pyramid-temple C1 has led archaeologist Henri Lehmann to speculate that it was once the house of the high priest.|$|E
5|$|The Wirgman Building was {{an early}} 19th-century Federal-style {{commercial}} and <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> located on East Main Street (U.S. Route 50) in Romney, West Virginia. Following its completion around 1825 {{to serve as the}} Romney branch office for the Bank of the Valley of Virginia, the Wirgman Building at various times served as a location for every subsequent bank established in Romney, to include the Bank of Romney and the First National Bank of Romney. During the American Civil War, the building was used as a military prison. For a time, the Wirgman Building's second floor housed the offices and printing plant of the Hampshire Review newspaper. By 1937, the ground floor of the Wirgman Building housed office and mercantile space, and the second floor was divided into apartments. After the Wirgman Building sustained damage in a fire in 1964, it was demolished in 1965 {{to make way for the}} construction of the new Bank of Romney headquarters building. Prior to its demolition, the Wirgman Building was photographed and documented by the National Park Service's Historic American Buildings Survey in 1937.|$|E
