25|$|Limpkins in Florida were {{examined}} for parasites, which included trematodes, nematodes and biting lice. Two biting lice species were found, Laemobothrion cubense and Rallicola funebris. The trematode Prionosoma serratum {{was found in}} the intestines of some birds, this species may enter the bird after first infecting apple snails (this {{has been shown to be}} the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> for a closely related trematode to infect snail kites). Nematodes Amidostomum acutum and Strongyloides sp. are also ingested and live in the gut.|$|E
2500|$|S. schenckii most {{commonly}} enters the body through minor trauma that compromises the skin barrier. It is this <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> coupled with its presence on roses that give sporotrichosis its common name of [...] "rose-handler's disease" [...] or [...] "rose thorn disease".

2500|$|Sporothrix schenckii is {{a fungus}} {{that can be}} found world-wide in the environment. The species is present in soil as well as in and on living and decomposing plant {{material}} such as peat moss. It can infect humans as well as animals and is the causative agent of sporotrichosis, commonly known as [...] "rose handler's disease". The most common <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> is the introduction of spores to the body through a cut or puncture wound in the skin. Infection commonly occurs in otherwise healthy individuals but is rarely life-threatening and can be treated with antifungals. In the environment it is found growing as filamentous hyphae. In host tissue it is found as a yeast. The transition between the hyphal and yeast forms is temperature dependent making S. schenckii a thermally dimorphic fungus.|$|E
40|$|Objectives—To {{examine whether}} {{cochlear}} implantation {{increases the risk}} of meningitis in the absence of other risk factors, and to understand the pathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis post cochlear implantation. Study Design and Setting — A quantitative threshold model in rats was established to examine how the presence of a cochlear implant and surgical insertion trauma alter the risk of pneumococcal meningitis post implantation from all potential <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> from the upper respiratory mucosa to the meninges. Results—The presence of a cochlear implant reduced the threshold of bacteria required to cause pneumococcal meningitis from all <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> (hematogenous, the middle ear and inner ear) in healthy animals. Mild electrode insertion trauma did not alter the threshold <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> Conclusion—Our animal model has demonstrated that cochlear implantation is an independent risk factor for pneumococcal meningitis. The presence of a foreign body such as a cochlear implant {{increases the risk of}} pneumococcal meningitis regardless <b>of</b> the <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> bacterial <b>infection.</b> Significance—Early detection and treatment <b>of</b> pneumococcal <b>infection</b> such as otitis media may be required in implant recipients as the experimental data suggest that the cochlear implantation leads to a reduction of threshold for meningitis...|$|R

40|$|Randomly bred {{guinea pigs}} were {{infected}} with Listeria monocytogenes using the intracardial, intravenous and intraperitoneal <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> Doses <b>of</b> Listeria ranged from 5 to 1, 000 x the 50 % lethal dose {{based on the}} 50 % lethal dose for intracardially injected Listeria. A complete necropsy was performed on all animals that died after infection. Gross and microscopic examination of tissues revealed major pathological features which include myocarditis, edema and congestion with interstitial pneumonitis present in the lungs, and fatty hepatic changes with focal necrosis. For all or {{a majority of the}} animals, large numbers of Listeria were likewise recovered from these organs and from lymph nodes, spleen, kidneys, and adrenal gland tissue. <b>Of</b> the three <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> used, guinea pigs were most susceptible to Listeria injected via the intracardial route. The relatively high lethal dose of listeric for the quinea pig, however, suggests that the organism is a low-grade pathogen for this species...|$|R
30|$|Syphilis is a multisystem {{bacterial}} infection {{caused by the}} spirochete Treponema pallidum [1]. It is primarily a sexually transmitted disease; however, contacts with an infected lesion and blood transmission are also potential <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> The classic clinical course of acquired syphilis is divided into four stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary syphilis [2]. The eye can be affected in any stage <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and virtually all ocular tissues can be affected.|$|R

40|$|Arenaviruses {{present an}} {{emerging}} health threat in agrarian areas of Africa and South America; however, the natural <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> arenaviral <b>infections</b> are not clearly understood. Our previous studies with {{lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus}} (LCMV), the prototype arenavirus, implicate oral and intragastric routes as natural <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> Our studies raised many questions about the primary site <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> dissemination after gastric infection. In this report, we use in situ hybridization to detect LCMV in various organs at different time points (0 to 96 hours). After gastric inoculation, the gastric mucosa is the initial site <b>of</b> viral <b>infection,</b> followed by <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> the spleen and liver, then ileum and last, lung, kidney, brain, and esophagus. Furthermore, our observations suggest that virus is disseminated lymphatically rather than by a hematogenous route. Infectious center assays using mononuclear cells from stomach, blood, and spleen of mice infected by the gastric route confirmed active infection with LCMV {{and the presence of}} mononuclear cells producing infectious virus in these tissues. This is the first identification of gastric epithelia as a primary site <b>of</b> virus <b>infection...</b>|$|R

40|$|Trypanosoma cruzi is an {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite {{capable of}} infecting through mucosal surfaces. Our laboratory has previously elucidated the anatomical <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> after both conjunctival and gastric challenge in mice. We {{have shown that}} chronically infected mice develop strong immune responses capable of protecting against subsequent rechallenge with virulent parasites through gastric, conjunctival, and systemic <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> We have also shown that intranasal immunizations with the unique T. cruzi trans-sialidase (TS) antigen protect against gastric and systemic T. cruzi challenge. In the current work we have investigated the ability of purified TS adjuvanted with CpG-containing oligonucleotides to induce immunity against conjunctival T. cruzi challenge. We confirm that intranasal vaccinations with TS plus CpG induce TS-specific T-cell and secretory IgA responses. TS-specific secretory IgA was detectable in the tears of vaccinated mice, the initial body fluid that contacts the parasite during infectious conjunctival exposures. We further show that intranasal vaccinations with TS plus CpG protect against conjunctival T. cruzi challenge, limiting local parasite replication {{at the site of}} mucosal invasion and systemic parasite dissemination. We also provide the first direct evidence that mucosal antibodies induced by intranasal TS vaccination can inhibit parasite invasion...|$|R
