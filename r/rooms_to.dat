5|$|In 1907, John Clark Udall oversaw {{construction}} of a north wing, {{increasing the number of}} <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> 150. In 1909, Udall oversaw a 72-room seven-story west wing, further increasing the <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> 221. In Germany, it was advertised in January 1909 that the management of the Briarcliff Lodge and its architect Guy King planned to construct the platform to launch and dock airships, to cost $100,000. The platform would extend over the whole roof, and the tracks for the airship launch would be on an incline 105 meters long. The plans also included the purchase of a searchlight to guide the airships. A mooring mast for docking airships was constructed on top of the west wing, however no record exists of it having been used. The mooring mast nonetheless was the first built for docking airships.|$|E

The other players lose {{the ability to control}} their men-at-arms, with their men staying in their <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> defend themselves. If the new king dies, the King's Guard will return to being neutral and the other princes regain their men.|$|E
5|$|The Valley Ho competed {{favorably with}} the Safari Hotel, erected {{about the same}} time east of Scottsdale Fashion Square. Both hotels offered premium hospitality, and helped Scottsdale expand its public image. With the Valley Ho an {{immediate}} financial success, in 1958 Varney designed and built two more wings of guest <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> the northwest of the original complex. The same materials and style were employed on the expansion buildings, but instead of single exterior corridors with <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> one side, the added wings loaded central corridors with rooms on both sides. Another Scottsdale landmark hotel, the Mountain Shadows Resort, opened the following year, in 1959. These three tourist havens reflected a desired cosmopolitan and exotic feel on Scottsdale.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the Clifton Maybank corridor, built in the 18th century from stone obtained from another house then undergoing alteration, allowed the principal ground- and first-floor <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> have some privacy from the servants' areas and linked the two staircases. It also allowed the house to be turned around by creating a new entrance façade facing west.|$|E

50|$|A long gallery has the {{appearance}} of a spacious corridor, but it was designed as a <b>room</b> <b>to</b> be used in its own right, not as a means of passing from one <b>room</b> <b>to</b> another. In the 16th century, the seemingly obvious concept of the corridor had not been introduced to British domestic architecture; rooms were entered from outside or by passing from one <b>room</b> <b>to</b> another.|$|R

5|$|By 1932, the Vassar {{population}} had outgrown the Alumnae Gymnasium {{and a new}} facility, the Helen Kenyon Hall of Physical Education, was built. Kenyon featured a new indoor pool (which, at , made {{it one of the}} United States' largest indoor swimming pools), as well as tennis, squash, and handball courts. Consequently, in 1933, the Alumnae Gymnasium was renamed Ely Hall after its early benefactor. In that same year, the building underwent minor renovation to convert some of the building's back <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> an outpatient clinic, nurses' quarters, and doctors' offices.|$|E
5|$|Christie's {{originally}} {{estimated the}} house contents at {{in excess of}} 10,000 items, but by 2008 a total of 30,000 items had been listed including: William Butterfield designed silver; original print books by Pugin and Ruskin; an unexploded Second World War bomb; a jewel-encrusted chalice; a roll of 19th-century flock wallpaper; and a coconut with carved face and hair. By 2013 the inventory had risen to 47,154 items, with still more <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> unpack and catalog.|$|E

5|$|Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine (1635–1708) oversaw a {{substantial}} remodelling {{of the house}} in 1684, and much of the existing south facade dates from that time. The end bays were heightened, and the central porch was rebuilt with stone quoins and pilasters, a balustraded top and a small tower and cupola. A plan from 1684 shows the hall in the house's centre, with service <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> the west and the main parlour to the east. On the first floor, the dining room was over the hall, the main bedchamber over the kitchen, and a lady's chamber over the porch.|$|E
5|$|Internally, Salvin knocked through {{existing}} <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> {{create the}} Outer Hall, a new gallery {{on the first}} floor, a billiard room, a new library and a drawing room. Much of the wooden 17th-century panelling in the parlour and the hall had to be stripped out {{as part of the}} renovations. As part of his work, Salvin appears to have used a number of rolled wrought-iron beams to span the resulting structural gaps in the building, an advanced use of that technology for the time. The house was refurnished with newly bought 16th and 17th-century artwork, two brass Italian cannons and a stuffed polar bear.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 1940, {{during the}} Blitz bombing {{campaign}} against Britain, {{it was decided}} to increase the protection of the Cabinet War Rooms by the installation of a massive layer of concrete known as 'the Slab'. Up to 5 feet (1.5 metres) thick, the Slab was progressively extended and by spring 1941 the increased protection had enabled the Cabinet War <b>Rooms</b> <b>to</b> expand to three times their original size. While the usage of many of the War Rooms' individual rooms changed {{over the course of the}} war, the facility included dormitories for staff, private bedrooms for military officers and senior ministers, and rooms for typists or telephone switchboard operators.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} of the palace's many <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> be {{completed}} was the main dining room, built from 1830 to 1834. The principal central wing of the mansion was constructed from 1831 to 1837. Between 1841 and 1842, a billiard room was constructed adjoining the dining room. From 1838 through to 1844, the guest wing, the east wing, towers, the service wing, and the front entrance were completed. The final wing built of the mansion was the library wing; this was under construction from 1842 to 1844. The remaining four years of building works were spent on the palace's interior decoration.|$|E
5|$|The current {{building}} sits on {{reclaimed land}} first {{occupied by the}} Marine Parade Community Centre, which {{was built in the}} early 1980s and later renamed to Marine Parade Community Club. In March 1995, the People's Association (PA) announced plans to spend S$9.56 million to upgrade 54 community centres and clubs that were over ten years old, adding facilities such as lifts, dance studios, karaoke rooms and multi-purpose air-conditioned activities <b>rooms,</b> <b>to</b> make community centres more user-friendly, with open concept offices and reception areas.|$|E
5|$|The ground floor, {{accessed}} {{directly from}} the outside courtyard, led into a portcullis-protected, vaulted passage, eleven feet wide and extending {{the depth of the}} building. On either side of the passage were two vaulted rooms. The room nearest the entrance on the right was a guardroom or the porter's room, which housed a well; the back-right room, with a garderobe located in the south west turret (accessed via a passage running along the south wall), was for an official. The other two <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> the left were used to house staff or storage.|$|E

5|$|The library, {{the last}} of the palace's <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> be completed, is based on Sir Walter Scott's own library, {{revealing}} the personal friendship that Blore had with Scott. Inside, the library features about 6,000 literary and musical works of the 18th and 19th centuries. The interior's woodwork, including the doors, panelling, and ceilings, is made out of oak. The walls are adorned in cloth, with designs made by Dutch, Flemish, French, and Italian painters. The palace's Gothic fireplaces are made out of polished diabase.|$|E
5|$|After the Inhuman leader Jiaying {{refuses to}} risk {{anyone else to}} rescue Campbell, Raina {{receives}} a vision of Skye saving him, and convinces Gordon to take Skye to the Playground, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s base. Coulson reforms his original S.H.I.E.L.D. team of May, Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, and they fly to the Arctic in their old mobile command base, a plane called the Bus. Their approach is detected by Hydra, who shoot down the Bus with missiles, but the team escape in a quinjet and infiltrate the base with Bakshi's help. Coulson, May, and Fitz break into the base's control <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> steal information about Hydra leader Wolfgang von Strucker's primary headquarters in the small Eastern European nation of Sokovia, while Skye, Ward, Bakshi, and Simmons rescue Peterson and Campbell. During the rescue, Simmons attempts to kill Ward as she once promised she would, but Bakshi {{gets in the way}} and Simmons murders him instead, and Ward flees after sparing Simmons' life.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} at Morley Memorial Junior School he was taught by Roger Waters' mother, Mary. Later, in 1957, he {{attended}} Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (with Waters). His father {{died of cancer}} on 11 December 1961, {{less than a month}} before Barrett's 16th birthday. Also on this day, Barrett had left the entry in his diary blank. By this time, his brothers and sisters had left home and his mother decided to rent out <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> lodgers. Eager to help her son recover from his grief, Barrett's mother encouraged the band in which he played, Geoff Mott and The Mottoes, a band which Barrett formed, to perform in their front room. Roger Waters and Syd Barrett were childhood friends, and Waters often visited such gigs. At one point, Waters even organised a gig, a CND benefit at Friends Meeting House on 11 March 1962, but shortly afterwards Geoff Mott joined the Boston Crabs, and the Mottoes broke up.|$|E
