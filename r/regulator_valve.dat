500|$|The {{introduction}} of Nos.A876A880 into service allowed No.A822 {{to be withdrawn}} for rebuilding with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear in August 1931. Other modifications included moving the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> from the smokebox to a new Nclass-type dome to ease access during routine maintenance {{and the addition of}} a front footstep behind the bufferbeam. Despite the opportunity to upgrade to the [...] tender attached to the new class members, No.A822 retained its smaller-capacity [...] flat-sided Ashford tender. The result of the various modifications was a heavier locomotive, although it now benefited from upgraded track on the Eastern section and the interchange of standardised parts that reduced the time needed to complete repairs. The rebuilt locomotive emerged from Ashford works as No.1822 in October 1931. Although the N1s displayed little overall improvement over the Nclass, they proved ideal for the gauge-restricted Hastings route, where their narrower profile allowed them to operate through narrow bridges and tunnels, and their power enabled them to haul heavier trains than the predominant ex-SECR 4-4-0 and 0-6-0s.|$|E

Steel fireboxes were used as well as [...] "Owens" [...] patent poppet <b>valve</b> and balanced <b>regulator</b> <b>valves.</b> As was usual for short-journey locomotives they were not fitted with superheating, as short journeys allow little time for the superheater elements to reach working temperature.|$|R
50|$|An M.L.S. multiple-valve {{regulator}} superheater header was fitted, {{arranged with}} the <b>regulator</b> <b>valves</b> located on its saturated steam side. The regulator spindle {{passed through the}} smokebox side and the operating rods were led along the left-hand side of the boiler to the cab. Steam was fed to the superheater header through a 7 in diameter internal steam pipe from a standpipe in the shallow dome. As an experiment, two of the engines were equipped with patent steam driers, fitted in the dome.|$|R
500|$|Maunsell and Holcroft {{completed}} {{plans for}} a new 3-cylinder locomotive in 1919. Designated N1, the new design was an attempt to increase the operational flexibility and power of the SECR 2-6-0 without substantially increasing axle loading. Holcroft's previous employment as an engineer involved with the GWR's 4300class meant that the N1 used the same Churchward features as the Nclass to aid standardisation and the manufacture of parts. These included the use of long-travel valves for free running at speed, right-hand drive in the cab and [...] driving wheels. The retention of the 2-6-0 wheel arrangement meant ample accommodation for the Nclass' tapered boiler with Belpaire firebox. As with the Nclass, detail design on the N1 was left to another of Maunsell's assistants, James Clayton, who brought functional Midland Railway influences to the design: the loading gauge-friendly shape of the cab, the tender and the large-diameter smokebox. The smokebox housed a large superheater, <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> and snifting (anti-vacuum) valves. [...] The N1 also retained Walschaerts valve gear on both outside cylinders.|$|E
2500|$|The J class also {{featured}} {{a number of}} other design advances over the K class. It had a larger grate, enabling grate sections to be compatible with those of the N class and permitting an increase in firebox volume sufficient to allow two arch tubes to be installed. Another innovation was the use of a <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> incorporating a centrifugal steam separator (to draw away any water and thus provide the driest steam), rather than the simpler (though extremely reliable) D <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> used in the K class. The J class {{also featured}} [...] substantially redesigned cylinder porting to improve steam flow and efficiency. The innovative SCOA-P type driving wheel centre developed for the Victorian Railways R class was adapted for the [...] diameter J class drivers.|$|E
2500|$|On an {{oxyacetylene}} torch system {{there will be}} three types of valves, the tank valve, the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve,</b> and the torch valve. There will be a set of these three valves for each gas. The gas in the tanks or cylinders is at high pressure. Oxygen cylinders are generally filled to approximately 2200 psi. The regulator converts the high pressure gas to a low pressure stream suitable for welding. [...] Acetylene cylinders must be maintained in an upright position to prevent the internal acetone and acetylene from separating in the filler material.|$|E

2500|$|The steam {{generated}} in the boiler fills the space above {{the water in the}} partially filled boiler. Its maximum working pressure is limited by spring-loaded safety valves. It is then collected either in a perforated tube fitted above the water level or by a dome that often houses the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve,</b> or throttle, the purpose of which is to control the amount of steam leaving the boiler. The steam then either travels directly along and down a steam pipe to the engine unit or may first pass into the wet header of a superheater, the role of the latter being to improve thermal efficiency and eliminate water droplets suspended in the [...] "saturated steam", the state in which it leaves the boiler. On leaving the superheater, the steam exits the dry header of the superheater and passes down a steam pipe, entering the steam chests adjacent to the cylinders of a reciprocating engine. Inside each steam chest is a sliding valve that distributes the steam via ports that connect the steam chest {{to the ends of the}} cylinder space. The role of the valves is twofold: admission of each fresh dose of steam, and exhaust of the used steam once it has done its work.|$|E

5000|$|To {{start the}} engine, the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> V was opened and steam {{admitted}} into the cylinder from the boiler, filling the space beneath the piston.

50|$|All modern {{pressure}} cookers {{will have}} a pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> and a pressure relief valve as a safety mechanism to prevent explosion {{in the event that}} the pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> fails to adequately release pressure. Some older models lack a safety release valve. Most home cooking models are built to maintain a low and high pressure setting. These settings are usually between 7 and 15 PSI. Almost all home cooking units will employ a very simple single-stage pressure regulator. Older models will simply use a small weight on top of an opening that will jiggle to allow excess pressure to escape. Newer models usually incorporate a spring-loaded valve that lifts and allows pressure to escape as pressure in the vessel rises. Some pressure cookers {{will have a}} quick release setting on the pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> that will, essentially, lower the spring tension to allow the pressure to escape at a quick, but still safe rate. Commercial kitchens also use pressure cookers, in some case using oil based pressure cookers to quickly deep fry fast food. In this case, {{and in the case of}} cooking at home, pressurized vessels can be used to cook food much more rapidly than it would take to cook large amounts of food without pressure. Pressure vessels of this sort can also be used to sterilize small batches of equipment and in home canning operations.|$|E
