50|$|The Latin American wars of Independence that {{occurred}} {{in the early nineteenth}} century in Latin America also led to a literary <b>movement</b> termed <b>Resistance</b> Literature. Writers were turning towards ideas and themes such as revolution, nationalism, and independence, showing their resistance towards imperialistic nations such as the United States. Cultural independence was a feeling that spread across Latin America during this time, and many writers began to depict themes in their works like individualism and pride in Latin American culture. While Resistance Literature as a whole first emerged during seventeenth century in Latin America, it rose in popularity in the form of resistance against the United States and other imperialist nations in the nineteenth century. Resistance literature was used as an attempt for Latin American writers to describe the journey towards Latin American identity, and was closely tied with the Modernismo literary <b>movement.</b> <b>Resistance</b> literature <b>warned</b> against the economic power of imperialist nations.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Resistance</b> <b>movements</b> {{can include}} any {{irregular}} armed force that rises up against an enforced or established authority, government, or administration. This frequently includes groups that consider {{themselves to be}} resisting tyranny. Some <b>resistance</b> <b>movements</b> are underground organizations engaged in a struggle for national liberation in a country under military occupation or totalitarian domination. Tactics of <b>resistance</b> <b>movements</b> against a constituted authority range from nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience, to industrial sabotage and guerrilla warfare, or even conventional warfare if the <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> is strong enough. Any government facing violent acts from a <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> usually condemns such acts as terrorism, even when such attacks target only the military or security forces. Resistance during World War II was mainly dedicated to fighting the Axis occupiers. Germany itself also had an anti-Nazi German <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> in this period. Although the United Kingdom did not suffer invasion in World War II, preparations were made for a British <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> {{in the event of}} a German invasion (see Auxiliary Units) ...|$|R

50|$|In 2011 the Finnish <b>Resistance</b> <b>Movement</b> also invited {{members of}} CasaPound to a seminar in Helsinki. This shows an {{ability of the}} European nationalists to {{organize}} beyond ideological differences. The Finnish <b>Resistance</b> <b>Movement</b> represents national socialism. The Finnish Security Intelligence Service researched the connections of the Finnish <b>Resistance</b> <b>Movement</b> to CasaPound after the Gianluca Casseri shootings.|$|R

50|$|In October 1944 the Greek {{mainland}} was {{liberated from}} the Germans and Italians and the occupiers left Greece. (The Germans held out another {{year at the}} Greek islands). The Greeks who had fought against the occupying forces were organized in the <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> ELAS, who was a Communist-led, but where {{a wide spectrum of}} Greeks from different political colors were represented. There was an other <b>resistance</b> <b>movement,</b> EDES, also that was a nationalist <b>resistance</b> <b>movement.</b> The British and the Russians supported the <b>resistance</b> <b>movement.</b> There were also Greeks who supported the occupiers the so-called collaborators.|$|R

50|$|The first <b>resistance</b> <b>movements</b> {{were created}} {{as early as}} in late 1939 in {{occupied}} Poland. As the war progressed {{and the number of}} Nazi-occupied territories grew, so did the number and strength of <b>resistance</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Some {{definitions}} of <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> have proved controversial. According to Joint Publication 1-02, the United States Department of Defense defines a <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> as [...] "an organized effort by {{some portion of}} the civil population of a country to resist the legally established government or an occupying power and to disrupt civil order and stability". In strict military terminology, a <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> is simply that; it seeks to resist (change) the policies of a government or occupying power. This may be accomplished through violent or non-violent means. In this view, a <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> is specifically limited to changing the nature of current power, not to overthrow it; and the correct military term for removing or overthrowing a government is an insurgency. However, in reality many <b>resistance</b> <b>movements</b> have aimed to displace a particular ruler, especially if that ruler has gained or retained power illegally.|$|R
50|$|During the {{independence}} movement, {{the rest of}} the world viewed Korea's <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> as a racial anti-imperialist, anti-militarist rebellion, and an anti-Japanese <b>resistance</b> <b>movement.</b> Koreans, however, saw the movement as a step to free Korea from the Japanese military rule.|$|R
50|$|However, other {{occupied}} countries, such as Norway, Poland and France, {{had no such}} {{requirements to}} forcibly provide troops to the Wehrmacht, and their <b>resistance</b> <b>movements</b> had virtually the entire male populace of those countries, to call upon. Also, even the extremely few men, untouched by conscription in Austria, who might make up a <b>resistance</b> <b>movement,</b> would certainly know that they would probably be killing fellow Austrians, forced into German service, with each and every <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> attack.|$|R

5000|$|In all {{occupied}} countries <b>resistance</b> <b>movements</b> sprang up. [...] The Germans {{tried to}} infiltrate and suppress them, {{but after the}} war they emerged as political actors.

50|$|The Partisans were a major Yugoslav <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> {{against the}} Axis {{occupation}} and partition of Yugoslavia. Initially the Partisans were in rivalry with the Chetniks {{over control of}} the <b>resistance</b> <b>movement.</b> However, the Partisans were recognized by both the Eastern and Western Allies as the primary <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> in 1943. After that, their strength increased rapidly, from 100,000 at the beginning of 1943 to over 648,000 in September 1944. In 1945 they were transformed into Yugoslav army, organized in 4 field armies with 800,000 fighters.|$|R

50|$|<b>Resistance</b> <b>movements</b> during World War II {{occurred}} in every occupied country {{by a variety}} of means, ranging from non-cooperation, disinformation and propaganda, to hiding crashed pilots and even to outright warfare and the recapturing of towns.

50|$|The <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> against Axis {{occupation}} {{was started}} in summer of 1941 by the communists. The resistance in Banat and Bačka was soon defeated, while resistance in Syrmia had more success. The Syrmian <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> grew into a popular uprising, and a large liberated territory (that included about 40 villages) was established in Syrmia. On liberated territory, a partisan authority was organized, which included mass anti-fascist organizations, publishing activity, and education. The experiences of the <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> in Syrmia were transferred to Banat and Bačka {{in the summer of}} 1944; before the Soviet Red Army arrived in October 1944, Vojvodina already had its new institutions of people's administration. The liberation movement was organized into 18 Vojvodinian brigades divided into 3 squadrons. 15,000 fighters of the <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> were killed during the liberation struggle.|$|R
