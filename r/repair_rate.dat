The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> and the associated costs increase significantly. Technically, durability can be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it deteriorates. After so many hours of use, the filament of a light bulb burns up and the bulb must be replaced. Repair is impossible.

5000|$|The {{traditional}} surgical {{approach to}} a mitral valve repair is a full or partial sternotomy, in which the surgeon cuts through the breastbone {{at the center of}} the chest to access the heart. There are minimally invasive (port access) options available pioneered by Hugo Vanerman in Belgium. The minimally invasive approach does not involve cutting the breastbone, but instead uses multiple incisions in the side of the chest and the leg. Cardiac surgeons are not unanimous about the relative merits of sternotomy versus the minimally invasive approach. The minimally invasive approach can produce a less prominent scar, is beneficial for very obese patients, and may allow the patient to return to their normal activity sooner than a sternotomy. But some cardiac surgeons argue that unless performed by the most experienced cardiac centers, minimally invasive surgery can involve a longer time on a bypass machine, a lower <b>repair</b> <b>rate,</b> and higher (although still low) risk of stroke. One cardiac surgery professor said, [...] "I think the only benefit is for cosmesis for the patient and the benefit is for marketing and growing our practices for ourselves because it’s a good way to grow one's practice." ...|$|E

50|$|Paddy Arnold, {{landlord}} of Oxwich Leisure Park, near Swansea, claimed Britton, {{the tenant}} with 42 others, should pay service repairs at 10% increases every year, as their contract expressly stated. Britton {{and others had}} leases for holiday chalets for 99 years from 1974. Each lease said it was granted ‘upon terms similar in all respects’ to other leases, and clause 3 said tenants should repair the chalets, for each other’s benefit. Clause 4(8) put a covenant on the lessors that covenants were the same. For a first group of leases, clause 3(2) said a lessee should pay ‘a proportionate part of the expenses’ for repairs and services, at £90 a year, increasing at a three-year compound rate of 10%. But in a second group, it said the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> should be increased by 10% every year. Those tenants claimed in 2011 that, with the annual service charge over £2700 (compared to the first group that was still paying £282 a year), their clause 3(2) should be reinterpreted as requiring a variable sum in fair proportion {{to the cost of}} the services, and a specified sum no more than a capped maximum. Arnold brought proceedings under CPR Part 8 to declare clause 3(2) required what it said.|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} parameters, namely {{breakdown}} rate (α) and <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> (β), on the queue {{length of the}} system have been demonstrated in Figs.  1 and 2. It is noticed that the breakdown rate and <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> {{are supposed to have}} contradictory effect on the queue length of the system which is very true. It is clear from Fig.  1 a–c that the queue length increases as the breakdown rate increases from 0.008 to 0.01  U for all the service time distributions. The maximum number of customers or queue length is observed in the case 1 (c) when the service time is supposed to be gamma distributed. On the other hand, in Fig.  2 wherein graphs are plotted for different values of <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> β (0.6, 0.8 and 1), LS decreases with an increase in the <b>repair</b> <b>rate.</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that an increase in breakdown rate forces the customers to accumulate in the system due to the non-working condition of the server and hence increases the queue length. However, an increase in the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> helps in the fast recovery of the server and thus reduces the number of customers in the system.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{occupational}} exposure to styrene on frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and binucleated cells with micronuclei and on single-strand break levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes was studied in 86 reinforced plastic workers and 42 control individuals (including 16 maintenance workers with intermittent, low-dose exposure). In these individuals, the irradiationspecific DNA <b>repair</b> <b>rates</b> and the <b>repair</b> <b>rates</b> of 8 -oxoguanines were investigated. We assessed the exposure {{by measuring the}} concentrations of styrene in air and in blood and of mandelic acid, phenylglyoxylic acid, 4 -vinyl phenol conjugates and regioisomeric phenyl hydroxyethyl mercapturic acids in urine. All these parameters correlated with one another. No clear relationship {{was found between the}} styrene exposure and the frequencies of chromosomal aberrations. Binucleated cells with micronuclei were moderately related to the parameters of styrene exposure. We found a negative correlation between all exposure parameters and single-strand breaks. The positive correlation between exposure parameters and DNA <b>repair</b> <b>rates</b> suggests that particular DNA repair pathways may be induced by styrene exposure.

40|$|International audienceThere is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} that stress-induced DNA damage may be responsible for cell lethality, cancer proneness and/or immune reaction. However, statistical features of their <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> remain poorly documented. In order to interpret the shape of the radiation-induced DNA damage repair curves with a minimum of biological assumptions, we introduced the concept of repair probability, specific to any individual radiation-induced DNA damage, whatever its biochemical type. We strengthened the apparent paradox that the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> of a population of DNA damage is time-dependent even if the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> of the individual DNA damage is constant. Hence, the existing models, based on a dual approach of the DNA repair may be insufficient for describing the DNA <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> over a large range of repair times. Since the repair probability of DNA damage cannot be assessed individually, the measurement of the DNA <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> is assumed to consist in determining the instantaneous mean of all repair probabilities. The relevance of this model was examined with different endpoints: cell species, genotypes, radiation type and chromatin condensation. The Euler's Gamma function was shown to provide the distribution the most consistent with such hypotheses. Furthermore, formulas, deduced from the Gamma distribution, were found to be compatible with our previous model, empirically defined but based on a variable repair half-time...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDNA is a key-target for {{genotoxic}} stress. Hence, {{the knowledge}} of induction and <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> of DNA damage are crucial to describe and predict the impact of stress situations. Unfortunately, DNA damage induction and repair rates are generally assessed separately whereas they act either concomitantly or transiently in living organisms. Furthermore, the interplay of induction and repair raises the question whether DNA repair adapts to respond to different amounts of DNA damage. In a previous report, we proposed a stochastic interpretation of the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> of the major radiation-induced DNA damage. We provided evidence that the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> of individual DNA damage is time-independent whereas that of a population of DNA damage is time-dependent (Foray, N., Charvet, A. -M., Duchemin, D., Favaudon, V., Lavalette, D., 2005. The <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> of radiation-induced DNA damage: a stochastic interpretation based on the gamma function. J. Theor. Biol. 236, 448 - 458). Here, to better describe situations in which DNA damage induction and repair occur together, our biostatistical model was modified {{by the introduction of}} a DNA damage induction parameter. Theoretical and experimental data were compared and discussed by taking concrete experimental situations: X-rays irradiation at different dose-rates, internal irradiation with radioactive compound, contamination with heavy metal and detection of DNA damage by immunofluorescence. By assuming that DNA <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> is invariant whatever the amount of DNA damage, our model provides good prediction of experimental data suggesting its relevance for the description of complex situations of co-toxicities...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With {{the growth}} of memory {{capacity}} and density, test cost and yield improvement are becoming more important. In the case of embedded memories for systems-on-a-chip (SOC), built-in redundancy analysis (BIRA) is widely used {{as a solution to}} solve quality and yield issues by replacing faulty cells with extra good cells. However, previous BIRA approaches focused mainly on em-bedded memories rather than commodity memories. Many BIRA approaches require extra hardware overhead to achieve the op-timal <b>repair</b> <b>rate,</b> which means that 100 % of solution detection is guaranteed for intrinsically repairable dies, or they suffer a loss of <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> to minimize the hardware overhead. In order to achieve both low area overhead and optimal <b>repair</b> <b>rate,</b> a novel BIRA approach is proposed and it builds a line-based searching tree. The proposed BIRA minimizes the storage capacity requirements to store faulty address information by dropping all unnecessary faulty addresses for inherently repairable die. The proposed BIRA analyzes redundancies quickly and efficiently with optimal <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> by using a selected fail count comparison algorithm. Experi-mental results show that the proposed BIRA achieves optimal re-pair rate, fast analysis speed, and nearly optimal repair solutions with a relatively small area overhead.

40|$|Abstract: Business {{facilities}} among domestic architectures have rapidly {{been constructed}} along with domestic economic development. It {{is an important}} facility taking the second largest proportion next to apartment buildings among current 31 building types of fire department classification of 2012 year for urban architectures. The expected service life of business facilities is 15 years, but 70 % of those in urban areas have surpassed the 15 year service life as of the present 2014. Thus, the demand for urgent rehabilitation of such facilities is constantly increasing due to the aging and performance deterioration of the facilities’main finishing materials. Especially, the business facilities are being used for the lease of company office or private office, and such problems as aging and performance deterioration of the facilities could cause less competitive edge for leasing and real estate value depreciation for the O&M (Operation & Management) agent and the owner, respectively. Therefore, an effective planned rehabilitation as a preventive measure according to the standardized <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> {{by the number of}} years after the construction is in need in order to prevent the aging and performance deterioration of the facilities(La et al. 2001). Nonetheless, domestic repair/rehabilitation standards based on the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> are mainly limited to apartment buildings and pubic institutions, resulting in impractical application of such standards to business facilities. It has been investigated and analyzed that annual <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> data for each finishing material are required for examination of the applicability of the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> standard for the purpose of establishment of a repair plan. Hence, this study aimed at developing a <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> computation model for finishin...|$|E

Failure {{times of the}} operating machines {{are assumed to be}} exponentially distributed with parameter lambda. Repair times of the first essential repair and the second optional repair are assumed to follow exponential distributions. A failed machine may leave the system either after the first essential repair with probability (1 -theta), or select to repair for second optional repair with probability theta (0 <=theta <= 1) at the completion of the first essential repair. We obtain the steady-state solutions through matrix-analytic method. A cost model is derived to determine the optimal number of the repairmen, the optimal values of the first essential <b>repair</b> <b>rate,</b> and the second optional <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> while maintaining the system availability at a specified level.

40|$|This {{article we}} study the {{statistical}} inferences of an availability system with imperfect coverage. The time-to-failure and time-to-repair {{of the active}} and standby components {{are assumed to be}} exponential and general distribution, respectively. Assume that the coverage factor is the same for an active-component failure as that for a standby-component failure. Firstly, we propose a consistent and asymptotically normal (CAN) estimator of availability for such repairable system. Based on the CAN estimator of the system availability, interval estimation and testing (hypothesis) are performed. To implement the simulation inference for the system availability, we adopt two repair-time distributions, such as lognormal and Weibull distribution, in which three types of Weibull distribution are considered according to the shape parameter. The component holds the decreasing <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> (DRR), constant <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> (CRR), and increasing <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> (IRR) if 1, = 1, and 1, respectively.

40|$|The {{rates at}} which lesions are removed by DNA repair can vary widely {{throughout}} the genome, with {{important implications for}} genomic stability. To study this, we measured the distribution of nucleotide excision <b>repair</b> (NER) <b>rates</b> for UV-induced lesions throughout the budding yeast genome. By plotting these <b>repair</b> <b>rates</b> in relation to genes and their associated flanking sequences, we reveal that, in normal cells, genomic <b>repair</b> <b>rates</b> display a distinctive pattern, suggesting that DNA repair is highly organized within the genome. Furthermore, by comparing genome-wide DNA <b>repair</b> <b>rates</b> in wild-type cells and cells defective in the global genome–NER (GG-NER) subpathway, we establish how this alters the distribution of NER rates throughout the genome. We also examined the genomic locations of GG-NER factor binding to chromatin before and after UV irradiation, revealing that GG-NER is organized and initiated from specific genomic locations. At these sites, chromatin occupancy of the histone acetyl-transferase Gcn 5 {{is controlled by the}} GG-NER complex, which regulates histone H 3 acetylation and chromatin structure, thereby promoting efficient DNA repair of UV-induced lesions. Chromatin remodeling during the GG-NER process is therefore organized into these genomic domains. Importantly, loss of Gcn 5 significantly alters the genomic distribution of NER rates; this has implications for the effects of chromatin modifiers on the distribution of mutations that arise throughout the genome...|$|R
