At what would be the graduation ceremony, Andrew shocks the drivers by appearing to destroy Dale's driving license; but reveals that what he actually destroyed was just a copy, and hands the <b>real</b> <b>license</b> over to Danny, who agrees to drive Dale back home. This, therefore, sets the stage for an all-male finale (the first-ever instance of such in the show's history), as Andrew announces that one of either Kevin, Michael or Sly will be Canada's Worst Driver Ever.|$|E

40|$|A {{vehicle license}} plate {{recognition}} system extracts plate {{information from a}} digital image through image processing technology. License plate extraction (LPE) is the premise and key concept of license plate recognition systems. In China, two-row license plates are yellow and dirty. Thus, a novel license plate extraction method based on CIELab color space is proposed in this paper. The method involves transforming a digital image from RGB color space to CIELab color space and using the b and a channels of CIELab color space to obtain the yellow areas of the digital image. Morphological operations are implemented to filter out noise and identify the license plate candidate areas. Lastly, texture features are utilized to locate the <b>real</b> <b>license</b> plate areas. Experiments indicate that the proposed method makes full use of digital image information to rapidly extract two-row license plate areas in a complicated environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Automatic {{license plate}} {{recognition}} (ALPR) {{is a pattern}} recognition application of great importance for access, traffic surveillance and law enforcement. Therefore many studies are concentrated on creating new algorithms or improving their performance. Many authors have presented algorithms {{that are based on}} individual methods such as skeleton features, neural networks or template matching for recognizing the license plate symbols. In this paper we present a novel approach for decisional fusion of several recognition methods, as well as new classification features. The classification results are proven to be significantly better than those obtained for each method considered individually. For better results, syntax corrections are also considered. Several trainable and non-trainable decisional fusion rules have been taken into account, evidencing each of the classification methods at their best. Experimental results are shown, the results being very encouraging by obtaining a symbol good recognition rate (GRC) of more than 99. 4 % on a <b>real</b> <b>license</b> plate database...|$|E
