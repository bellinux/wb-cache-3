The inventor could be his physician friend Santorio Santorio or another person of the learned circle in Venice of which they were members. Devices employing both heat and pressure were common during Galileo's time, used for fountains, nursing, or bleeding in medicine. The device was built from a small vase filled with water, attached to a thin vertically <b>rising</b> <b>pipe,</b> with a large empty glass ball at the top.

A pressure-resistant <b>rising</b> <b>pipe</b> (1) e. g. steel pipe, opens out into the aquarium tank, and produces an increased hydrostatic pressure in the aquarium tank by a liquid column located in the <b>rising</b> <b>pipe.</b> The aquarium tank is arranged in an underground mine e. g. coal mine. The <b>rising</b> <b>pipe</b> is upwardly extended over an earth surface for increasing hydrostatic pressure in the aquarium tank. A suction pump (22) is attached at a purge valve (21). USE - Aquarium i. e. deep sea aquarium, for accommodation and survey of a marine animal i. e. fish, in an underground mine i. e. coal mine. Can {{also be used for}} a public zoo. ADVANTAGE - The pressure-resistant <b>rising</b> <b>pipe</b> opens out into the aquarium tank and produces increased hydrostatic pressure in the aquarium tank by liquid column located in the <b>rising</b> <b>pipe,</b> thus separating function of pressurization from the aquarium tank, optimizing the aquarium tank and the pipe, avoiding extension of the aquarium tank over a large height difference, reducing manufacturing cost of the aquarium, and tempering the aquarium simply with small vertical extension as temperature-limited water movements are intensively reduced due to the small vertical extension. The aquarium is designed such that hydrostatic pressure in the aquarium is determined by height of the liquid column in the pipe, thus providing a small cross section for the pipe, reducing operational risk, and allowing small amount of liquid to leak during leakage or breaking of the pipe...|$|E

50|$|One {{key feature}} when {{preventing}} flash-gas is {{the diameter of}} the piping. If the pipes are too thin and long, loss of pressure and friction tend to occur. If the evaporator is too high above the receiver, the <b>rising</b> <b>pipes</b> produce a small amount of vacuum at the topmost portion, making the fluid to undergo ebullition and produce flash-gas. On the contrary, a refrigerant column that creates weight and pressure may reduce the chances of finding flash-gas. If the evaporator is a plate exchanger placed below the level of the receiver, the pressure will not allow the refrigerant to boil easily.|$|R

40|$|Nitrate (NO 3 -) is {{commonly}} dosed in sewer systems to reduce sulfide (H 2 S) and methane (CH 4) produced in anaerobic <b>rising</b> main <b>pipes.</b> However, anoxic conditions along the whole <b>rising</b> <b>pipes</b> are difficult and costly to maintain since nitrate is added at the upstream {{sections of the}} sewer. In this study we tested {{the effects of the}} Downstream Nitrate Dosage strategy (DND) in anaerobic pipes in a specially designed laboratory-scale systems that mimics a real rising main. Effectiveness of the strategy was assessed on H 2 S and CH 4 abatement on the effluent of the lab sewer system. A combination of process (Normal Functioning monitoring and batch tests) and molecular (by 454 -pyrosequencing) methods were used to investigate the impacts and microbial activities related to the nitrate addition. Results showed a complete abatement of H 2 S generated, with a fraction transformed to elemental sulfur (S 0). Methane discharged was reduced to 50 % while nitrate was added, due to the CH 4 oxidation in the anoxic conditions established {{at the end of the}} pipe. Both sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities resumed upon cessation of NO 3 - dosage. An increase of microorganisms of the genera Simplicispira, Comamonas, Azonexus and Thauera was detected during nitrate addition. Regarding anoxic methane oxidation, only one Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) was identified, which is likely related with this metabolism.

The test samples were divided two groups, one is the metal corrugated sheet with heat pipe, and the other is the metal corrugated sheet only.

The results shown the temperature risen of the sheet with heat pipe was faster than that of the sheet without heat pipe. In addition, the bigger of the temperature difference between hot water temperature and ambient temperature, the quicker of the temperature risen for the metal corrugated sheet, and the temperature of the metal corrugated sheet were homogenous as well.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is much {{uncertainty}} about the future impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases. Such uncertainty reflects the difficulties in modelling the complex interactions between disease, climatic and socioeconomic determinants. We used a comprehensive panel dataset from Mexico covering 23 years of province-specific dengue reports across nine climatic regions to estimate the impact of weather on dengue, accounting {{for the effects of}} non-climatic factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a Generalized Additive Model, we estimated statistically significant effects of weather and access to piped water on dengue. The effects of weather were highly nonlinear. Minimum temperature (Tmin) had almost no effect on dengue incidence below 5 °C, but Tmin values above 18 °C showed a rapidly increasing effect. Maximum temperature above 20 °C also showed an increasing effect on dengue incidence with a peak around 32 °C, after which the effect declined. There is also an increasing effect of precipitation as it rose to about 550 mm, beyond which such effect declines. <b>Rising</b> access to <b>piped</b> water was related to increasing dengue incidence. We used our model estimations to project the potential impact of climate change on dengue incidence under three emission scenarios by 2030, 2050, and 2080. An increase of up to 40 % in dengue incidence by 2080 was estimated under climate change while holding the other driving factors constant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that weather significantly influences dengue incidence in Mexico and that such relationships are highly nonlinear. These findings highlight the importance of using flexible model specifications when analysing weather-health interactions. Climate change may contribute to an increase in dengue incidence. <b>Rising</b> access to <b>piped</b> water may aggravate dengue incidence if it leads to increased domestic water storage.
