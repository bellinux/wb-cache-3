2500|$|When he {{was still}} an infant, his parents moved to nearby Royston, where he was raised. By most accounts, he became fascinated with {{baseball}} as a child, and {{decided he wanted to}} play professional ball one day; his father was vehemently opposed to this idea, but by his teen years, he was trying out for area teams. He played his first years in organized baseball for the Royston <b>Rompers,</b> the semi-pro Royston Reds, and the Augusta Tourists of the South Atlantic League who released him after only two days. He then tried out for the Anniston Steelers of the semipro Tennessee–Alabama League, with his father's stern admonition ringing in his ears: [...] "Don't come home a failure!" [...] After joining the Steelers for a monthly salary of $50, Cobb promoted himself by sending several postcards written about his talents under different aliases to Grantland Rice, the sports editor of the Atlanta Journal. Eventually, Rice wrote a small note in the Journal that a [...] "young fellow named Cobb seems to be showing an unusual lot of talent." [...] After about three months, Cobb returned to the Tourists and finished the season hitting [...]237 in 35 games. In August 1905, the management of the Tourists sold Cobb to the American League's Detroit Tigers for US$750 (equivalent to approximately $ in today's funds).|$|E

Then she went to work and ironed Jims's little <b>rompers.</b> Rilla scolded her gently for it when she herself came in to do it.|$|E

60|$|The only grown-up daughters at home, Ethelberta and Picotee, {{with their}} brother Joey, were sitting near her; the two {{youngest}} children, Georgina and Myrtle, {{who had been}} strutting {{in and out of}} the room, and otherwise endeavouring to walk, talk, and speak like the gentleman just gone away, were packed off to bed. Emmeline, of that transitional age which causes its exponent to look wistfully at the sitters when romping and at the <b>rompers</b> when sitting, uncertain whether her position in the household is that of child or woman, was idling in a corner. The two absent brothers and two absent sisters--eldest members of the family--completed the round ten whom Mrs. Chickerel with thoughtless readiness had presented to a crowded world, to cost Ethelberta many wakeful hours at night while she revolved schemes how they might be decently maintained.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was no}} {{easy thing}} for me to think seriously of {{anything}} in the hamlet; for I was in some way, my dear children, though I say it myself, a favourite with the young and with the old, so that I could not walk ten paces without some greeting or address. There were my own brothers trailing behind me, Baker Mitford's children tugging at my skirts, and the millwright's two little maidens one on either hand. Then, when I had persuaded these young <b>rompers</b> to leave me, out came Dame Fullarton the widow, with a sad tale about how her grindstone had fallen out of its frame, and neither she nor her household could lift it in again. That matter I set straight and proceeded on my way; but I could not pass the sign of the Wheatsheaf without John Lockarby, Reuben's father, plunging out at me and insisting upon my coming in with him for a morning cup.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rompers</b> {{appeared}} in the United States of America in the early 1900s. They were popular as playwear for younger children because people thought they were ideal for movement. <b>Rompers</b> were {{in many ways the}} first modern casual clothes for children. They were light and loose fitting, a major change from the much more restrictive clothing children wore during the 19th Century Victorian era. Styles and conventions varied from country to country. In France they were, for many years, only for boys. While primarily a play garment, some French children wore dressy <b>rompers.</b> Their popularity peaked in the 1950s when they were used by children as playwear and by women as leisure- and beachwear. Thereafter the garment has continued to be used by infants and toddlers; however, it has become less common among older girls and women, although never disappearing entirely.|$|E

5000|$|Pucker! marks another stylistic {{deviation}} for the band. According to Terry <b>Rompers</b> of Trouser Press, {{the album}} is mostly a [...] "mild-mannered version" [...] of the band's ska roots, [...] "clinging to the familiar peppy keyboard, bass, guitar and snare syncopation of ska," [...] but also adding giddy elements from new wave music and power pop. The sound of the album {{has been compared to}} [...] "the Yachts, perhaps, or the Go-Go's" [...] discovering [...] "some old Skatalites records." [...] <b>Rompers</b> described the album as containing a [...] "harmlessly bizarre blend of elements" [...] that helped distance the album from its predecessor, while Martin C. Strong saw the album as an attempt to broaden the band's horizons. In his overall review of the band's discography, <b>Rompers</b> said of the new direction taken by the band on Pucker!: [...] "The same mob made The Happy Album made Pucker!, but you'd never know it from the catchy chorus of 'My Perfect World,' which leads it off, or the cornball pot-centric version of Bob Dylan's 'Rainy Day Women #12 & 35' that curls up near the end." ...|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of its release, <b>Rompers</b> was never ported to a home video game console, nor was given an {{official}} North American release, possibly due to one of the enemies, Fumajime Pyokorin, being involved in drug use, and the Japanese voice samples; the game's soundtrack was released in two compilation discs known as Namco Video Game Graffiti Volume 5, and Namco Video Game Graffiti Volume 6, which included soundtracks for other Namco games as well. The first official home conversion for the game was in Namco Museum Encore, the series' only Japanese-exclusive installment (which also featured Wonder Momo and was released on the Sony PlayStation) - and in 2009, <b>Rompers</b> went on to appear on the Nintendo Wii's Japanese Virtual Console market.|$|E
