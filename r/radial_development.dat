They were awarded a development contract to continue work on two designs, which {{would later become}} the 109-002 and 109-003 when the RLM officially started supporting jet development. The -002 used an advanced contra-rotating compressor for added efficiency, while the -003 used a simpler compressor/stator system that remains in use in modern designs today. The -002 proved to be too complex and work on it soon ended, but the -003 showed definite promise and eventually became the BMW 003.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} radial and axial flow regime {{development}} in adiabatic upward air–water two-phase flow in a vertical annulus has been investigated. Local flow regimes {{have been identified}} using conductivity probes and neural networks techniques. The inner and outer diameters of the annulus are 19. 1 mm and 38. 1 mm, respectively. The equivalent hydraulic diameter of the flow channel, DH, is 19. 0 mm and the total length is 4. 37 m. The flow regime map includes 1080 local flow regimes identifications in 72 flow conditions within a range of 0. 01 m/s < 〈jg〉 < 30 m/s and 0. 2 m/s < 〈jf〉 < 3. 5 m/s where 〈jg〉 and 〈jf〉 are, respectively, superficial gas and liquid velocities. The local flow regime has been classified into four categories: bubbly, cap–slug, churn-turbulent and annular flows. In order to study the radial and axial development of flow regime the measurements have been performed at five radial locations. The three axial positions correspond to z/DH = 52, 149 and 230, where z represents the axial position. The flow regime indicator has been chosen as some statistical parameters of local bubble chord length distributions and self-organized neural networks {{have been used as}} mapping system. This information has been also used to compare the results given by the existing flow regime transition models. The local flow regime is characterized basically by the void fraction and bubble chord length. The <b>radial</b> <b>development</b> of flow regime shows partial and complete local flow regime combinations. The <b>radial</b> <b>development</b> is controlled by axial location and superficial liquid velocity. The radial flow regime transition is always initiated {{in the center of the}} flow channel and it is propagated towards the channel boundaries. The axial development of flow regime is observed in all the flow maps and it is governed by superficial liquid velocity and radial location. The prediction results of the models are compared for each flow regime transition...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn the {{three-dimensional}} boundary layer {{produced by a}} rotating disk, the experimentally well-documented sharp transition from laminar to turbulent flow is shown to coincide with secondary absolute instability of the naturally selected primary nonlinear crossflow vortices. Fully saturated primary finite-amplitude waves and the associated nonlinear dispersion relation are first numerically computed using a local parallel flow approximation. Exploiting the slow <b>radial</b> <b>development</b> of the basic flow, the naturally selected primary self-sustained flow structure is then derived by asymptotic analysis. In this state, outwards spiralling nonlinear vortices are initiated at the critical radius where primary absolute instability first occurs. A subsequent secondary stability analysis reveals {{that as soon as}} the primary nonlinear waves come into existence they are already absolutely unstable with respect to secondary perturbations. Secondary disturbances growing in time at fixed radial locations continuously perturb the primary vortices, thus triggering the direct route to turbulence prevailing in this configuration...|$|E

Pre-processing is performed to adjust the orientation of the primary leaf in the image using a Fourier Transform. A Wavelet Transform is then applied to partially remove low frequency information or background in the image. Subsequently, the diseased regions of the primary leaf are segmented out as blobs using Otsu’s thresholding. The disease blobs are normalised and then radially partitioned into sub-regions (using a Radial Pyramid) representing <b>radial</b> <b>development</b> of many diseases. Finally, global features are computed for different pyramid layers and combined to create a feature descriptor for training a linear SVM classifier. The system is evaluated by classifying three types of wheat leaf disease: non-diseased, Yellow Rust and Septoria.

40|$|SummarySchwann cells (SCs) myelinate {{peripheral}} neurons {{to promote}} the rapid conduction of action potentials, {{and the process of}} myelination is known to be regulated by signals from axons to SCs. Given that SC mitochondria are one of the potential regulators of myelination, we investigated whether SC mitochondria are regulated by axonal signaling. Here, we show a purinergic mechanism that sends information from neurons to SC mitochondria during myelination. Our results show that electrical stimulation of rat sciatic nerve increases extracellular ATP levels enough to activate purinergic receptors. Indeed, electrical stimulation of sciatic nerves induces Ca 2 + increases in the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix of surrounding SCs via purinergic receptor activation. Chronic suppression of this pathway during active myelination suppressed the longitudinal and <b>radial</b> <b>development</b> of myelinating SCs and caused hypomyelination. These results demonstrate a neuron-to-SC mitochondria signaling, which is likely to have an important role in proper myelination...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the global {{evolution of the}} viscous stage of a turbulent protoplanetary disk. The time-dependent <b>radial</b> <b>development</b> of the nebula is calculated {{with the help of}} analytical one-zone models of the vertical structure that relate optical properties of grains to turbulent viscosity. Special attention is given to possible growth of dust particles that cause significant opacity and hence viscosity changes. In the framework of a simple two component model for the dust size population we follow the evolution of the total surface density of the disk. Assuming that grain growth is especially rapid in the main condensation regions (e. g. due to enhanced sticking probabilities) we find significant surface density enhancements in these radially confined regions. Moreover a lower turbulence strength in these regions (e. g. caused by the suppression of thermal convection) leads to a further increase in the density. Possible consequences for planet formation are briefly outlined. (orig.)

30|$|To {{examine the}} {{differences}} between juvenile and mature wood, 12 aged sample trees from two areas of Nagano Prefecture were harvested; and the <b>radial</b> <b>development</b> of tracheid length, the ring density, and {{the relation of the}} radial growth rate (observed by ring width) with some selected indices of ring structure were investigated. The results proved that the radial variation of tracheid length with ring number can be described by a logarithmic formula, and both plantations reached the demarcation of juvenile and mature wood at age 18. With the segmented regression method, we also analyzed radial variation of mean density and found that the demarcation of juvenile and mature wood was at age 15 for sample trees from Saku and at age 21 for those from Yabuhara. By using the results of estimates from juvenile and mature wood based on ring density, we found that high growth rates resulted when producing lower-density wood during the juvenile period, but these rates did not occur during the mature period. The basic reason for this phenomenon is the variation in patterns of earlywood and latewood in juvenile and mature wood, respectively. This result advised us that when managing plantations of Japanese larch it is necessary to take different measurements at different growth periods.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA small polar lobe forms at {{the first}} and second {{cleavage}} divisions in the gastropod mollusc Crepidula fornicata. These lobes normally fuse with the blastomeres that give rise to the D quadrant at the two- and four-cell stages (cells ultimately generating the 4 d mesentoblast and D quadrant organizer). Significantly, removal of the small polar lobe had no noticeable effect on subsequent development of the veliger larva. The behavior of the polar lobe and characteristic early cell shape changes involving protrusion of the 3 D macromere at the 24 -cell suggest that the D quadrant is specified prior to the sixth cleavage division. On the other hand, blastomere deletion experiments indicate that the D quadrant is not determined until the time of formation of the 4 d blastomere (mesentoblast). In fact, embryos can undergo regulation to form normal-appearing larvae if the prospective D blastomere or 3 D macromere is removed. Removal of the 4 d mesentoblast leads to highly disorganized, <b>radial</b> <b>development.</b> Removal of the first quartet micromeres at the 8 -cell stage also leads to the development of radialized larvae. These findings indicate that the embryos of C. fornicata follow the mode of development exhibited by equal-cleaving spiralians, which involves conditional specification of the D quadrant organizer via inductive interactions, presumably from the first quartet micromeres...|$|E

40|$|The radial glial cells {{serve as}} neural {{progenitors}} {{and as a}} migratory guide for newborn neurons in the developing cerebral cortex. These functions require appropriate organization and proliferation of the polarized radial glial scaffold. Here, we demonstrate in mice that the myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate protein (MARCKS), a prominent cellular substrate for PKC, modulates radial glial placement and expansion. Loss of MARCKS results in ectopic collection of mitotically active radial progenitors away from the ventricular zone (VZ) in the upper cerebral wall. Apical restriction of key polarity complexes [CDC 42, β-catenin (CTNNB 1), N-cadherin (CDH 2), myosin IIB (MYOIIB), aPKCζ, LGL, PAR 3, pericentrin, PROM 1] is lost. Furthermore, the radial glial scaffold in Marcks null cortex is compromised, with discontinuous, non-radial processes apparent throughout the cerebral wall and deformed, bulbous, unbranched end-feet at the basal ends. Further, the density of radial processes within the cerebral cortex is reduced. These deficits in <b>radial</b> glial <b>development</b> culminate in aberrant positioning of neurons and disrupted cortical lamination. Genetic rescue experiments demonstrate, surprisingly, that phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC is not essential {{for the role of}} MARCKS in <b>radial</b> glial cell <b>development.</b> By contrast, the myristoylation domain of MARCKS needed for membrane association is essential for MARCKS function in radial glia.
