5|$|In 1976, a {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Tintin and the Picaros, Hergé told the journalist Numa Sadoul that he was contemplating the next adventure of Tintin—setting an entire story in an airport lounge. This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set the story in the world of modern art. During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly interested in this subject, and decided to incorporate his love of avant-garde artwork into the new story. Being a <b>regular</b> <b>at</b> Brussels' art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art scene when producing the story. Given his age, and the length of time that it was taking him to produce each Adventure, British literary critic Michael Farr suggested that Hergé likely knew that this would be his final installment in the series.|$|E

Blaine also saw the public regularly, and Guiteau became a <b>regular</b> <b>at</b> these sessions. Blaine, who {{had no intention of}} giving Guiteau a position he was unqualified for and had not earned, simply stated that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship, which required Senate confirmation. Once the New York senators had resigned, and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector, Guiteau pressed his claim, and Blaine told him he would not receive the position.|$|E
