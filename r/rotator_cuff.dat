5|$|Nova {{struggled}} at {{the beginning}} of the 2012 season, recording a 5.60 ERA through May, but decreased it to 3.92 by the All-Star break. During an interleague game against the Atlanta Braves on June 11, 2012, Nova got his first career base hit off of Randall Delgado in a 3–0 win. Nova was not very effective after the All-Star break, pitching to a 2–5 record with a 6.40 ERA in 10 starts, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> inflammation. Due to his struggles late in the season, the Yankees decided to demote Nova to the bullpen for the postseason roster until the team lost in the 2012 ALCS to the Detroit Tigers.

Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41. With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the team's poor 2003 record, Johnson {{retained}} Edwards as head coach and extended his contract through 2007. With a healthy Pennington at quarterback, the Jets began their season at 5–0 {{for the first time}} and then lost two of their next three games. During the team's second meeting with the Bills, Pennington suffered a tear in his <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> that caused him to miss three starts. Pennington returned in a 29–7 rout of the Houston Texans. The team struggled toward the end of the regular season, winning only one of its final four games. Despite a final-game loss to the St. Louis Rams, the Jets reached the playoffs. The team traveled to San Diego to play the Chargers in the wild card round and upset them 23–20 on a Doug Brien field goal in overtime. The win sent the Jets to the divisional round against the 15–1 Pittsburgh Steelers. The Jets again took their opponent to overtime, as Brien missed a field goal with two minutes remaining and the score tied. He missed a second field goal in overtime. Pittsburgh kicker Jeff Reed proved more accurate, and the Steelers beat the Jets, 20–17.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{his strong}} finish in 2012, Kendrick entered spring {{training}} assured of {{a spot in}} the Phillies' Opening Day starting rotation {{for the first time in}} five years and spent his first full season exclusively a member of the major league starting rotation. His 2013 season took the opposite trajectory of his 2012 campaign; he held a 4–1 record with a 2.47 ERA in his first eight starts, while he posted a 6–12 record with a 5.65 ERA in his final 22 starts. Some suggested that because Kendrick is a contact pitcher (i.e., he focuses on getting outs via batters hitting the ball rather than striking out), his career-worst batting average on balls in play indicated horrendous defense was the primary reason for his downturn, not necessarily poor pitching. However, both were likely contributing factors. On September 18, he was scratched from his scheduled start due to right <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> tendinitis, which may have contributed to his poor pitching down the stretch. It was the first time in Kendrick's career he missed a start due to injury. He had initially planned on making his next start, but the Phillies announced on September 20 that Kendrick had been shut down for the remainder of the season after receiving a second opinion on the injury. The team placed him on the disabled list for his first career stint and Zach Miner took his spot in the rotation. Overall, he posted 10–13 with a 4.70 ERA in 182 innings pitched.|$|E
25|$|A <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> tear can {{be caused}} by the {{weakening}} of the <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> tendons.

25|$|Tendinitis is {{inflammation}} (redness, soreness, and swelling) of a tendon. In tendinitis of the shoulder, the <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> and/or biceps tendon become inflamed, usually as {{a result}} of being pinched by surrounding structures. The injury may vary from mild inflammation to involvement of most of the <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff.</b> When the <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> tendon becomes inflamed and thickened, it may get trapped under the acromion.

As {{a result of}} repetitive microtrauma {{in the setting of}} a degenerative <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> tendon, inflammatory mediators alter the local environment, and oxidative stress induces tenocyte apoptosis causing further <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> tendon degeneration. A neural theory also exists that suggests neural overstimulation leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and may also contribute to tendon degeneration.|$|E

In preparing this talk, I’ve been reflecting on the changes that have affected my career since I attended my first Academy meeting back in 1975. That meeting was also here in San Francisco. It was my first year in practice; I had a two-year-old daughter. Now I have three children; they’re all grown, they’re all through college, and they’re all contributing to society in very positive ways. I remember the meeting in 1975 clearly. I remember being impressed by the depth and breadth of the science and being very proud to be a member of the Academy. Not long ago, I came across the program from 1975. As impressive as the science was, the strides we’ve made since then are nothing less than astounding.

CTS has been chosen as the sentinel health event for upper limb musculoskeletal disorders within the work-related musculoskeletal disorders epidemiologic surveillance program, implemented in 2002 in the French Pays de la Loire region. This program combines several complementary components to describe the epidemiologic state of CTS: incidence rates and the proportion of cases that might be attributable to work in the general population, prevalence rates among the workers. The average 12 -month incidence of surgical CTS was 2. 7 in 1, 000 women and 1. 2 in 1, 000 men in the Maine-et-Loire area. Prevalence rates of CTS estimated in a sample of workers from the whole region were 4. 0 % in women and 2. 4 % in men, after shoulder <b>cuff</b> <b>rotator</b> syndrome.

25|$|The tendons of the <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff,</b> not the muscles, {{are most}} {{commonly}} involved, {{and of the}} four, the supraspinatus is most frequently affected, as it passes below the acromion.

Even though the supraspinatus is the most commonly injured muscle of the four muscles in the <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff,</b> the other three muscles that comprise the <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff,</b> the infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis, may also be injured.|$|E
