5|$|Although Tingting passed about 400km (250mi) to the {{northeast}} of Guam, torrential rains from a monsoonal feeder band produced record-breaking <b>rainfall.</b> In the span of 24hours, 554.99mm (21.85in) of rain fell on Guam, shattering both the record for highest single day <b>rainfall</b> and the monthly <b>rainfall</b> for June at 80.26mm (3.16in) and 371.09mm (14.61in) respectively. Most of the northern areas of the island received more than 510mm (20in) of rain but the southern areas of Guam reported much lower totals. At Anderson Air Force Base, a total of 287.78mm (11.33in) of rain was recorded over a 30-hour span. Rota recorded much less <b>rainfall</b> than Guam, having 145.28mm (5.72in) during 24hours and a storm total of 221.99mm (8.75in). No <b>rainfall</b> was recorded on both Tinian and Pagan Island {{due to the lack}} of observations. On Saipan, a total of 197.61mm (7.78in) was measured.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Helene recurving away from the United States East Coast, damage in the United States outside of the Carolinas was less severe. In Virginia, damage was {{relatively}} minor. A peak gust of 56mph (90km/h) was reported in Norfolk. In Hampton Roads, damage was minor, and was confined to downed utility wires and marginal infrastructural damage. Although <b>rainfall</b> was primarily concentrated in the Carolinas, 1,434official rain gauges measured precipitation in coastal areas from South Carolina to Maine. Precipitation was further increased by a frontal zone to the hurricane's north. In the Mid-Atlantic States, <b>rainfall</b> peaked at 5.29in (134.4mm) in Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Outside of Pennsylvania or the Carolinas, no weather station reported <b>rainfall</b> exceeding 5in (125mm). In the New England region, <b>rainfall</b> peaked at 4.11in (104.4mm) in Hyannis, Massachusetts. Elsewhere in Massachusetts, <b>rainfall</b> totals ranging from 1–4in (25–100mm) caused minor flooding and road washouts. The minor floods led to several automotive accidents. Other states in New England reported <b>rainfall</b> peaks of at least 1in (25mm), with the lowest peak occurring at a weather station in Machias, Maine, which reported 1.16in (29.5mm) of <b>rainfall.</b>|$|E
5|$|As an extratropical cyclone, Charley brought heavy <b>rainfall</b> {{and strong}} winds to Ireland and the United Kingdom, causing at least 11deaths. In Ireland, the <b>rainfall</b> set records for 24-hour totals, {{including}} {{an accumulation of}} more than 7.8in (200mm) which set {{the record for the}} greatest daily <b>rainfall</b> total in the country. In the country, the <b>rainfall</b> caused widespread flooding, causing two rivers to exceed their banks. In the Dublin area, 451buildings were flooded, some up to a depth of 8ft (2.4m). In the United Kingdom, the storm flooded rivers and brought down trees and power lines.|$|E
30|$|Figure  1 {{illustrates}} {{in detail}} the statistics represented by the functional form of logarithm, and {{the correlations between the}} <b>rainfalls</b> and the land property lawsuits. The pattern of <b>rainfalls,</b> which is showed on the top panel of Fig.  1, is more stable, and there exists a weakly positive correlation between the <b>rainfalls</b> and the land property lawsuits on the bottom panel of Fig.  1. This preliminary evidence indicates that <b>rainfalls</b> might affect the numbers of lawsuit and excluded the possible impacts from some extreme samples. In the panel B of Table  1, the variable of land property lawsuits is negatively associated to the average police. The results based on the correlations suggest that <b>rainfalls</b> may bring fewer impacts on land disputes. To further investigate the effects of <b>rainfalls</b> on the lawsuits, in the next section we applies ordinary least squares (OLS) and two stage least squares (2 SLS) to assess whether <b>rainfalls</b> are significant.|$|R
30|$|The {{influences}} {{about the}} land-property lawsuits in relations to <b>rainfalls</b> from the regression analysis: it shows no significant influences. An {{interesting thing is}} that, when we use temperature and evaporation as the instrument variables of <b>rainfalls,</b> we find that there exists a negative significant influence on quantities of land-property lawsuit. Which means that increase amount of <b>rainfalls</b> will show significant decreasing the quantity of land lawsuit cases. Therefore, the amount of <b>rainfalls</b> has direct or indirect influences {{on the value of}} lands. The empirical results from this article extend the ones from the past literature. Miguel et al. (2004), Ciccone (2011), Brückner and Ciccone (2011) studied the causal relationships of civic wars, economic shock, and democracy when the volatility of <b>rainfalls</b> becomes more and more unstable. In this article, we focus on an issue between <b>rainfalls</b> and property rights, and the evidences shows that a huge shock in values of lands closely depends on <b>rainfalls</b> in Taiwan from 1920 to 1940.|$|R

5|$|As an extratropical low {{combined}} with a frontal system, Bonnie continued to produce moderate <b>rainfall</b> in Canada, peaking at 3.5inches (90mm) in Edmundston, New Brunswick.

5|$|August 12, 2004- The {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Bonnie produce heavy <b>rainfall</b> of over 3inches (76mm). The <b>rainfall</b> leads to flooded rivers and roads, forcing {{the evacuation of}} 100people in Delaware City.|$|E

30|$|The {{contribution}} of Brückner and Ciccone (2011) {{is that the}} <b>rainfalls</b> variable is a key factor which triggers democratic institutions in sub-Saharan regions with relatively scarce <b>rainfalls.</b> In other words, their results demonstrate that the lawsuit changes may be triggered by natural environment shocks. A negative shock from <b>rainfalls</b> will significantly reduce the land disputes if we can follow the arguments discussed by Brückner and Ciccone (2011), but, following our results, we find that a rainfall-abundant country will also decrease its social disputes or conflicts as long as <b>rainfalls</b> are more stable. However, in our considerations, we find that <b>rainfalls</b> have important roles {{in the process of}} economic development, especially in the economy which is based on agriculture as the mainstay such like Taiwan in the periods of Japanese colonial rule.|$|R
50|$|Atmospheric {{precipitation}} {{also plays}} a role of abundance water in Nerodimka river. The average of <b>rainfalls</b> for every month is 73.3 mm. Months with the most <b>rainfalls</b> are April-May, 105.6 mm, while at least August with 42.2 mm.|$|R

30|$|The {{economic}} outputs {{in agricultural}} societies highly depend on <b>rainfalls.</b> When {{the amount of}} <b>rainfalls</b> is not changing rapidly, the economic outputs will stably grow and then promote an increase in population. In most situations, the growth rate from the agricultural lands is always lower than that from the population, and in turn people would care about their own land property so {{that more and more}} disputes from land lawsuits occur in these countries. Therefore, if fluctuations of <b>rainfalls</b> maintain to be more stable, the number of land lawsuits may be decreased.|$|R

5|$|Beginning around September10, heavy <b>rainfall</b> {{occurred}} sporadically {{in southern}} Mexico and into Central America, {{influenced by a}} broader storm system related to Hurricane Floyd.

5|$|Harvey caused minor {{flooding}} in south Florida because {{of light to}} relatively heavy <b>rainfall</b> in {{that portion of the}} state and at least 34houses and businesses in southern Florida were flooded.

Throughout the rest of the United States, impact was limited, confined to light <b>rainfall</b> in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Heavy <b>rainfall</b> was reported in Atlantic Canada and Harvey became the wettest tropical cyclone on record in that country.

5|$|Hurricane Charley {{affected}} {{at least}} ten U.S. states, resulting in five total deaths and $15 million in damage (1986 USD). The precursor disturbance to Charley brought <b>rainfall</b> to much of Florida, including a total of 8.61 inches (219 millimetres) in Steinhatchee; that <b>rainfall</b> maxima was the greatest total associated with Charley within the United States. The system also produced light to moderate <b>rainfall</b> across Georgia and South Carolina, which proved beneficial as the region was in a major drought. However, its heaviest <b>rainfall</b> remained over open waters.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Irene also {{produced}} heavy <b>rainfall</b> in southeastern Virginia {{of up to}} 12inches (305mm) in Chesapeake. The <b>rainfall</b> resulted in widespread street flooding, with some locations reporting flooding of up to 4feet (1.2m) deep.|$|E
