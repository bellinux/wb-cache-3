25|$|This {{means that}} any {{citizen of the}} canton may <b>request</b> <b>service</b> and {{official}} documents such as ballots in their language of choice, that all three languages {{may be used in}} court, and that a member of the cantonal parliament is free to use any of the three languages. Since 1991, all official texts of the cantonal parliament must be translated into Romansh and offices of the cantonal government must include signage in all three languages. In practice, the role of Romansh within the cantonal administration is limited and often symbolic and the working language is mainly German. This is usually justified by cantonal officials on the grounds that all Romansh speakers are perfectly bilingual and able to understand and speak German. Up until the 1980s it was usually seen as a provocation when a deputy in the cantonal parliament used Romansh during a speech.|$|E
25|$|This {{standard}} defines an Alert# {{signal that}} is used by an eSPI slave to <b>request</b> <b>service</b> from the master. In a performance-oriented design or a design with only one eSPI slave, each eSPI slave will have its Alert# pin connected to an Alert# pin on the eSPI master that is dedicated to each slave, allowing the eSPI master to grant low-latency service because the eSPI master will know which eSPI slave needs service and will not need to poll all of the slaves to determine which device needs service. In a budget design with more than one eSPI slave, all of the Alert# pins of the slaves are connected to one Alert# pin on the eSPI master in a wired-OR connection, which will require the master to poll all the slaves to determine which ones need service when the Alert# signal is pulled low by one or more peripherals that need service. Only after all of the devices are serviced will the Alert# signal be pulled high due to none of the eSPI slaves needing service and therefore pulling the Alert# signal low.|$|E

50|$|The {{processor}} reserves {{low memory}} addresses for two-word vectors that give a program counter and processor status word {{with which to}} begin a service routine. When an I/O device interrupts a program, it places the address of its vector on the bus to indicate which service routine should take control. The lowest vectors are service routines to handle various types of trap. Traps occur on some program errors, such {{as an attempt to}} execute an undefined instruction; and also when the program executes an instruction such as BPT, EMT, IOT, or TRAP to <b>request</b> <b>service</b> from the operating system.|$|E

50|$|The {{process begins}} when a {{shepherding}} group identifies {{a hospital in}} need and contacts IMEC to <b>request</b> <b>service.</b> IMEC’s assessment volunteers have many {{years of experience in}} working with hospitals in the developing world. IMEC and the sponsoring humanitarian organization work with hospital personnel to assess the hospital’s needs and to create a plan for its rejuvenation. The plan lists only the needed types of medical support - maternity, surgical, dental, eye care, etc. - and IMEC uses that plan {{to begin the process of}} equipment acquisition and preparation. Shepherding groups are often established humanitarian organizations, church groups, or in-country health system willing to support a project over a three- to five-year period.|$|E

50|$|The IATA {{airport code}} of Viracopos is VCP and the {{specific}} city code of Campinas is CPQ. Sometimes both codes are used as one {{although there is a}} distinction between them in airline reservation systems: VCP, together with CGH (Congonhas) and GRU (Guarulhos), is part of the multiple airport system set around the city of São Paulo (code SAO). An airline that files services with the code VCP has flights displayed when passengers or travel agents <b>request</b> <b>service</b> from São Paulo, whereas flights filed with the code CPQ are displayed as service from Campinas, not São Paulo. A similar example is New York City (NYC), in which the airport codes LGA (LaGuardia Airport), JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport), and EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport) are used for the same city, although the latter is located in a different city and state.|$|E
