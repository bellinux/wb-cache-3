Recombinational repair {{was found to}} be a common feature of the DNA repair repertoire of at least 6 genera of enterobacteria. This conclusion is based on observations of (i) damage-induced synthesis of RecA-like proteins, (ii) nucleotide hybridization between E. coli recA sequences and some chromosomal DNAs, and (iii) recA-negative complementation by plasmids showing SOS-inducible expression of truncated E. coli <b>recA</b> <b>genes.</b> The mechanism of DNA damage-induced gene expression is therefore sufficiently conserved to allow non-E. coli regulatory elements to govern expression of these cloned truncated E. coli <b>recA</b> <b>genes.</b> In contrast, the process of mutagenic repair, which uses umuC+ umuD+ gene products in E. coli, appeared less widespread. Little ultraviolet light-induced mutagenesis to rifampicin resistance was detected outside the genus Escherichia, and even within the genus induced mutagenesis was detected in only 3 out of 6 species.

50|$|The {{evolution}} of meiosis from transformation happened as eukaryotes evolved through endosymbiosis between an anaerobic host cell, {{most likely to}} be an archaeon and an internalized aerobic bacterium, {{most likely to be}} a descendant of α-proteobacterium, a likely ancestor of extant mitochondria. A genomic analysis on 630 orthologous groups hints a close evolutionary relationship between alpha-proteobacterial and eukaryotic proteins, suggesting there was indeed genetic transfer and, therefore, transformation between the two cells. Furthermore, in extant organisms, the <b>RecA</b> <b>gene</b> orthologs which are crucial for meiotic recombination have a high sequence similarity to that of the <b>RecA</b> <b>gene</b> in proteobacteria or cyanobacteria.

The multimers comprised tandem repeats of monomer plasmid DNA. Treatment of purified plasmid DNA with exonuclease III revealed the presence of free double-chain ends in the molecules. Determination of the size of multimeric DNA, by pulse field gel electrophoresis, revealed that the bulk of the DNA was in the range 50 - 240 kb, representing approximately 5 - 24 unit lengths of monomeric plasmid DNA. We provide a conceptual framework for Red-system-promoted formation and enhanced accumulation of plasmid linear multimers in lon mutants of E. coli...|$|R
