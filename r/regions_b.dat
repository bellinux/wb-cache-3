In addition, it is defined as having a distinctly different structure or consistency than the horizon(s) above and the horizon(s) below.

5000|$|Brassica elongata, the {{elongated}} mustard or long-stalked rape, is {{a species}} of the mustard plant that is native to parts of Central Europe, Eastern Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, the Caucasus, Morocco and parts of Central Asia. Through plant invasion this species has become naturalized in {{many other parts of}} the world. Some of these naturalized regions include South Africa, North Western Europe, Australia and North America. Given the wide range of climate and ecological conditions of these <b>regions,</b> <b>B.</b> elongata has been able to disrupt the ecosystems of their native plant habitats and has been label as an invasive species in many of its naturalized zones. In North America, this species is often found as a roadside weed in the southwestern states, particularly in the state of Nevada. Studies allude that the Cruciferae might have migrated through the Bering land bridge from what is now Central Asia. Commonly known as the long-stalked rape or as [...] in German, this species is a close cousin to Brassica napus (rapeseed) and a secondary genetic relative to B. oleracea (kale). As a close genetic species of the rapeseed, the long-stalked rape {{has one of the highest}} counts of accumulated polyunsaturated linoleic and linolenic acid. Both compounds are heavily used to manufacture vegetable oils. Brassica elongata has the propagative potential of turning into a horticultural product from what is currently a noxious weed.|$|E

The literacy rate among youth is higher as compared to many other districts and as a result there are plenty of Doctors, Engineers, MBAs, Lawyers, Chartered Accountants, and in other professions. There are some of students who are studying in prestigious institutes of London (United Kingdom), Australia, USA, Singapore and other gulf countries.Apart as professionals, mostly youths are interested in government jobs because of village's culture and ambient. Defense (Indian Army) is one of the most adorable and honored jobs in Khuri. Once the secondary is finished, goals are automatically decided which leads patriotism and love for country. There would be at least one person from each family in defense as an average. Lt. Col. Govind Singh Shekhawat has been awarded with the prestigious Vir chakra previously.

However, in region D, advertising is socially harmful (k is small) and a mixed duopoly undertakes more advertising than a private one. Thus, privatisation is the optimal policy.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} clarify the focal {{mechanisms}} in the deep part of <b>Region</b> <b>B,</b> we divided <b>Region</b> <b>B</b> into two subregions, Regions B- 1 and B- 2, based on the focal mechanism distribution shown in Figs. 5 (a)–(c). Using the same procedure for Region A, we estimated the reference focal mechanism (Reference mechanism B) for the earthquakes in Region B- 2. Figure 4 (b) and Table 1 show Reference mechanism B and its fault parameters for the nodal planes, respectively. Reference mechanism B is a focal mechanism having a nodal plane dipping to the WNW-ESE direction, which is classified as a thrust type mechanism according {{to the definition of}} Frohlich (1992). A number of the earthquakes in <b>Region</b> <b>B</b> have focal mechanisms with small Kagan angles from Reference mechanism B (Figs. 5 (d)–(f)).
