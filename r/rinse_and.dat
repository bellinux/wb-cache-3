500|$|... "What Love Is Made Of" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by British recording artist Katy B. Written by Katy alongside Goldon Warren, who also produced it under the name Geeneus, the track was released as a standalone single via digital retailers on 8 July 2013 by <b>Rinse</b> <b>and</b> Columbia Records. It was composed after Katy had been listening to dance genres. The theme conveyed in the lyrics is love while musically, the song {{has been described as}} a [...] "trance-y" [...] and [...] "rave-y" [...] dance song with its production containing synthesizers and piano. Katy later decided to not include it in Little Red (2014).|$|E
500|$|In April 2011, Katy {{released}} her debut album, entitled On a Mission, by <b>Rinse</b> <b>and</b> Columbia Records. Exploring dubstep-based musical genres, it garnered critical praise, including being {{nominated for the}} Mercury Prize. In the UK, it was a commercial success, peaking at number 2 in the UK. Following that release, was the extended play (EP) Danger, which was available online in December 2012. During an interview with Billboard held in March 2013, Katy revealed that her sophomore studio album was nearly done. Katy revealed to MTV UK website District MTV that she felt inspired to record [...] "What Love Is Made Of" [...] by hearing dance music. She then got a bassline which made her [...] "want to dance", and included it in the track. She also told the website that she wrote the song about the [...] "feeling of love, what one person can give to you that someone else can't".|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gamma {{irradiation}} {{has been}} widely used for sterilization of bone allografts. However, gamma irradiation alters proteins. This is favorable when it reduces immunogenicity, but is undesirable when osteoinductive proteins are damaged. Although the effect of gamma irradiation on BMPs has been studied, the effect of irradiation {{on the process of}} incorporation of morselized bone chips remains unclear. We studied the effects of sterilization by gamma irradiation on the incorporation of impacted morselized allografts. METHODS: Bone chambers with impacted allografts, rinsed impacted allografts, allografts that were <b>rinsed</b> <b>and</b> subsequently irradiated, and an empty control were implanted in proximal medial tibiae of goats. Incorporation was evaluated using histology and histomorphometry. RESULTS: Histology revealed evidence of bone graft incorporation, which proceeded in a similar way in unprocessed, <b>rinsed,</b> <b>and</b> both <b>rinsed</b> <b>and</b> irradiated bone grafts. After 12 weeks, no difference in bone and tissue ingrowth was found between the unprocessed, the <b>rinsed,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>rinsed</b> <b>and</b> subsequently irradiated allografts. The amount of unresorbed graft remnant was highest in the unprocessed bone grafts. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that sterilization with gamma irradiation does not influence the incorporation of impacted rinsed bone allografts...|$|R

In a {{previous}} study, we {{have suggested that}} the salivary ATP swab test provides a simple and valid method to establish oral hygiene. (The assessment of oral hygiene with the ATP detection test : A comparative study of tooth brushing and garglerelated variation using the salivary ATP swab test) The purpose of the current study is to assess oral hygiene before and after tooth-brushing followed by either <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling three times with 150 mL tap water or twice with 150 mL saline. Saliva ATP values were 4. 12 and 2. 98 times higher than the baseline after first <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling with tap water and saline, respectively. In addition, after second <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling either with tap water or saline, the ATP values were close to those of the saliva before tooth-brushing. Moreover, after third <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling with tap water, the ATP value was lower prior to tooth-brushing. Significant difference was found in comparing the mean ATP values in saliva. First <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling with saline increased ATP values, whereas, the second <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling decreased ATP values to below the pre-rinsing baseline, although the difference was not statistically significant. Thus, the saliva was contaminated by tooth-brushing, however, it was considered possible that rinsing off with more than 300 mL liquid can remove debris stagnant in the oral cavity...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of multiple decontamination procedures for salivary contamination after curing of a universal adhesive on dentin bond strength according to its etch modes. Materials and Methods Forty-two extracted bovine incisors were trimmed by exposing the labial dentin surfaces and embedded in cylindrical molds. A universal adhesive (All-Bond Universal, Bisco) was used. The teeth were randomly divided into groups according to etch mode and decontamination procedure. The adhesive was applied according to the manufacturer's instructions for a given etch mode. With the exception of the control groups, the cured adhesive was contaminated with saliva for 20 sec. In the self-etch group, the teeth were divided into three groups: control, decontamination with <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> drying, <b>and</b> decontamination with <b>rinsing,</b> drying, <b>and</b> adhesive. In the etch-and-rinse group, the teeth were divided into four groups: control, decontamination with <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> drying, decontamination with <b>rinsing,</b> drying, <b>and</b> adhesive, <b>and</b> decontamination with <b>rinsing,</b> drying, re-etching, <b>and</b> reapplication of adhesive. A composite resin (Filtek Z 350 XT, 3 M ESPE) was used for filling and was cured on the treated surfaces. Shear bond strength was measured, and failure modes were evaluated. The data were subjected to one-way analysis of variation and Tukey's HSD test. Results The etch-and-rinse subgroup that was decontaminated by <b>rinse,</b> drying, re-etching, <b>and</b> reapplication of adhesive showed a significantly higher bond strength. Conclusions When salivary contamination occurs after curing of the universal adhesive, additional etching improves the bond strength to dentin...|$|R
