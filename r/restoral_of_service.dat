[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 In Air Trafﬁc Control (ATC), communications outages {{may lead to}} immediate loss of communications or radar contact with aircraft. In the short term, there may be safety related issues as important services including power systems, ATC, or communications for ﬁrst responders during a disaster may be out <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial damage from airline delays and cancellations may occur in the long term. This highlights {{the different types of}} impact that may occur after a disaster or other geographic event. The question is How do we evaluate and improve the ability of a mission-critical network to perform its mission during geographically correlated failures? To answer this question, we consider several large and small networks, including a multi-layer ATC Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) network known as SWIM. This research presents a number of tools to analyze and mitigate both long and short term geographic vulnerabilities in mission critical networks. To provide context for the tools, a disaster planning approach is presented that focuses on Resiliency Evaluation, Provisioning Demands, Topology Design, and Mitigation of Vulnerabilities. In the Resilience Evaluation, we propose a novel metric known as the Network Impact Resilience (NIR) metric and a reduced state based algorithm to compute the NIR known as the Self-Pruning Network State Generation (SP-NSG) algorithm. These tools not only evaluate the resiliency of a network with a variety of possible network tests, but they also identify geographic vulnerabilities. Related to the Demand Provisioning and Mitigation of Vulnerabilities, we present methods that focus on provisioning in preparation for rerouting of demands immediately following an event based on Service Level Agreements (SLA) and fast rerouting of demands around geographic vulnerabilities using Multi-Topology Routing (MTR). The Topology Design area focuses on adding nodes to improve topologies to be more resistant to geographic vulnerabilities. Additionally, a set of network performance tools are proposed for use with mission critical networks that can model at least up to 2 nd order network delay statistics. The ﬁrst is an extension of the Queueing Network Analyzer (QNA) to model multi-layer networks (and speciﬁcally SOA networks). The second is a network decomposition tool based on Linear Algebraic Queueing Theory (LAQT). This is one of the ﬁrst extensive uses of LAQT for network modeling. Beneﬁts, results, and limitations of both methods are described.

The preparatory tasks are (1) determination of a time de-warping function or its equivalent time-warping compensation function and (2) use of that determined function to increase the degree of cyclostationarity thereby rendering it more amenable to cyclostationarity exploitation techniques that are well known to be effective for various types of statistical inference and decision objectives, particularly in situations where the signal of interest present in the data is masked by noise and/or interfering signals also present in the data.|$|R

P 53 and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) have been reported to control the functionality of PI 3 K/AKT signaling. In this study we evaluated whether reintroducing P 53 using non-viral gene transfer enhances PTEN-mediated inhibition of PI 3 K/AKT signaling by cetuximab in PC 3 prostate adenocarcinoma cell line bearing p 53 and pten mutations. Signaling phosphoproteins expression was analyzed using Bio-Plex phosphoprotein array and western blot.

40|$|Summary: Using in vivo microcomputed {{tomography}} (micro-CT), {{we found}} in parathyroid hormone (PTH) -treated osteopenic rats linear increases in cortical and trabecular, due to increased trabecular thickness and number, bone mass. Bone was formed in cavities, leading to <b>restoral</b> <b>of</b> nearly cleaved trabeculae. For the first time, effects in PTH-treated rats were analyzed longitudinally. Introduction: Our aims were to over time (1) determine changes in trabecular thickness and number after PTH, (2) compare responses to PTH between the meta- and epiphysis, (3) determine effects of PTH on mineralization and mechanical properties, (4) determine locations of new bone formation due to PTH on a microlevel, and (5) determine the predictive value of bone structural properties for gain in bone mass after PTH. Methods: Adult rats were divided into ovariectomy (OVX; n = 8), SHAM-OVX (n = 8), and OVX and PTH treatment (n = 9). Between weeks 8 and 14, PTH rats received daily subcutaneous PTH injections (60 µg/kg/day). At weeks 0, 8, 10, 12, and 14, in vivo micro-CT scans were made of the proximal and diaphyseal tibia. After sacrifice, all tibiae were tested in three-point bending. Results: PTH increased bone volume fraction linearly over time in meta- and epiphysis, accompanied by increased trabecular thickness in both and increased trabecular number only in the latter one. CT-estimated mineralization increased in trabecular and remained constant in cortical bone. Ultimate load and energy were increased and ultimate displacement and stiffness unaltered compared to SHAM rats. For those trabeculae analyzed, bone was formed initially on places where it was most beneficial for increasing their strength and later on to all surfaces. © 2009 The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Telecommunication {{networks}} are evolving {{to become more}} reliable, but many networks remain vulnerable to widespread systemic failures. Reliability of individual components has improved and some networks can achieve availabilities {{on the order of}} 0. 99999. However, the routing technologies used by these networks, like Open Shortest Path First and Border Gateway Protocol can create system-wide vulnerabilities. Some of the vulnerabilities include widespread outages such as earthquakes and floods, unintentional device mis-configurations, and hacker attacks. One of the leading-edge architectures to address system-wide outages is the use of a dual-core backbone, which uses two independent long-haul cores to connect the network’s sites. The network is designed to tolerate the failure of a single core and leave the network fully functional. This work presents an OPNET simulation model of a dual-core architecture. This model predicts the <b>restoral</b> time <b>of</b> various network outages for different device configuration options and different topology options. ...|$|R

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> from a user {{perspective}} of a transportation facility or service is a fundamental concept of the Highway Capacity Manual. In determining quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> an arterial, six levels <b>of</b> <b>service</b> thresholds are defined in the Highway Capacity Manual based on average through vehicle speed. In fact, the arterial level <b>of</b> <b>service</b> {{is not so much}} describing the quality <b>of</b> transportation <b>service</b> provided by the facility, as much as the quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> provided to through motorized vehicles (i. e., automobile users). Although this quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> concept does address the primary mode of travel, it does not address the quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> the arterial provides to other major potential modes: transit, pedestrian and bicycle. Proposed levels <b>of</b> <b>service</b> in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual for pedestrians and bicyclists are essentially based on how crowded the respective modal facilities are. However, recent research on pedestrian and bicycle quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> indicate that the most important factors are lateral separation of the mode from motorized vehicles, and motorized vehicle volume, speed, and type. For scheduled fixed route bus users the most important factors for quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> along an arterial are frequency of transit vehicles (headways and hours <b>of</b> <b>service)</b> and pedestrian access.
