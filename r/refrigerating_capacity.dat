40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a dynamic modeling of a single-effect absorption chiller working with LiBreH 2 O solution {{used in a}} solar cooling installation operating without any backup systems (hot or cold). In this case, the absorption machine is powered only by a solar collector field. Given the highly variable nature of solar radiation and the building loads, {{the range of the}} three source temperatures of the chiller can vary widely since there is no backup system. These fluctuating source temperatures mean that the chiller does not operate in steady state phase during the day. The dynamic modeling of the absorption chiller is therefore very important to predict its performance, taking into account both the transient and steady state phases. The numerical model presented in this paper is based on the mass and energy balances of each component, equations of state and equations of heat transfers. In the first part, this article presents the dynamic modeling of a LiBr/H 2 O absorption chiller. Then, experimental validation elements are proposed to validate pressures and temperatures of the chiller.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} systematically {{the effects of}} different wheel speeds (10 - 30 m/s) on the structural, microstructural, magnetic, and magnetocaloric properties of as-spun and annealed Ni-Co-Mn-Sn ribbons. The ribbons comprised a mixture of austenite with L 2 (1) cubic structure and non-modulated martensite with L 1 (0) tetragonal structure. Both as-spun and annealed ribbons showed {{an increase in the}} reverse martensitic transformation temperature (T-m,) and a decrease in the thermal hysteresis (T-hys) when the wheel speed was increased from 10 m/s to 25 m/s. Unexpectedly, the T-m decreased and the T-hys increased in the ribbons prepared with a wheel speed of 30 m/s. This finding may be attributed to the appearance of the gamma-precipitated phase, which was lacking in the other samples. The martensitic transformation with a large magnetocaloric effect can be tailored in a wide temperature range, i. e., 30 K for the as-spun ribbons and 33 K for the annealed ribbons. The as-spun ribbons prepared at 15 m/s and annealed ribbons prepared at 25 m/s achieved large effective <b>refrigerating</b> <b>capacities</b> of 48. 8 and 47. 8 J/kg, respectively, in the field change of 0 - 1 T.

GouldEquipment {{to store}} foods at proper {{temperatures}} {{is critical to}} serving safe and nutritious meals in schools yet {{little is known about}} the amount or the adequacy of refrigerated storage in school nutrition programs. The purposes of this study were to identify the types and capacity of refrigeration equipment used in schools, determine the perceived adequacy of <b>refrigerated</b> storage <b>capacity</b> to meet new meal pattern requirements, and examine differences in adequacy and capacity. A modified Delphi technique, site observations, pilot study, and electronic survey were used for data collection. School nutrition directors in the USDA/FNS Southwest Region (N= 2392) served as the population. Respondents provided an inventory of refrigeration equipment for one of the schools in their district and information about perceived adequacy of refrigerated storage, barriers to purchasing refrigeration equipment, resources used to develop specifications, and practices to compensate for inadequate refrigerated storage in their program. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, independent sample t-tests, regression, and ANOVA. Over a third of directors indicated that refrigerated equipment was inadequate to meet new meal pattern requirements. Directors with more experience rated adequacy higher than directors with less experience. Milk coolers (n= 212, 88. 3 %) and walk-in freezers (n= 180, 75. 0 %) were the types of refrigeration equipment found most often in schools.

40|$|Eco-friendly non-CFC {{refrigerants}} {{were introduced}} in the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration industry {{during the last few}} years to reduce damage to the stratospheric ozone layer. The HFC refrigerant R- 134 a, which has zero Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP), is being used extensively as a replacement for R- 12 and also in some centrifugal chillers as a replacement for R- 11. However, the disadvantage of R- 134 a is its comparatively high global warming potential (GWP). Owing to energy crisis and also to reduce the indirect warming impact resulting from electrical energy usage, the new refrigeration systems should be operated at the lowest possible condensing temperatures. In view of this, several active and passive techniques for augmentation of condensation heat transfer and reduction of condensation temperature are gaining increasing attention. Passive augmentation methods are more popular than active ones. To this end, micro-finned tubes of various geometrical shapes are being explored for compact heat exchangers in the refrigeration industry as the best choice. Towards understanding the enhancement in condensation heat transfer coefficients in micro-finned tubes, a test facility has been fabricated to measure the condensing coefficients for R- 134 a refrigerant. Condensation experiments have been conducted on single plain and finned tubes of outer diameter 19 mm with a refrigerant saturation temperature of 400 C and tube wall temperatures 350 C, 320 C, 300 C and 280 C respectively. Water is used as the cooling medium inside the tubes with the flow rate varying from 180 lph to 600 lph. The condensing coefficient typically ranged from 0. 9 – 1. 4 kW/(m 2 K) for plain tubes and from 4. 2 to 5. 8 kW/(m 2 K) for the finned tubes. The results of the plain v tube are found to compare favourably with the Nusselt’s theory, leading to a validation of the experimental procedure. Upon comparing the results of finned and plain tubes, it is found that provision of fins result in an enhancement factor of 3. 6 to 4. 6 in the condensation heat transfer coefficients. This level of enhancement is larger than that resulting from the enhanced surface area of the finned tube surface, suggesting that, apart from the extended area, the surface tension forces {{play an important role in}} the augmentation process by driving the condensate from the fin crests to the valleys in between the fins. The measured augmentation factors have also been cross-checked using the Wilson plot method. Detailed error analysis has been performed to quantify the uncertainty in the condensation heat transfer coefficient. The performance of a bank of tubes has been determined based on the measurements carried out on practical condensers of two large chillers with <b>refrigerating</b> <b>capacities</b> of 500 TR and 550 TR.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{experimental and}} numerical investigation of ejection refrigeration system dedicated for short time storage of food products for local retail market, especially in rural areas. This work {{was sponsored by}} US Dept. of Agriculture under Phase I SBIR program. This novel method does not use electricity and is cleaner for the environment than other refrigeration techniques. One of the crucial problems of the retail market of perishable foodstuff {{is a lack of}} efficient and appropriate <b>refrigerated</b> storage <b>capacity.</b> The existing technology in most cases uses conventional refrigeration systems that consume a large amount of electricity, they are expensive as well as use harmful working substances (usually artificial GHG gases that have high greenhouse warming potential in comparison with most of the natural substances). In addition, ensuring required storage conditions in terms of the stability of the product temperature and humidity may be a challenge for most of the existing short time storage refrigerators. Â Responding to these challenges we developed an ejector based refrigeration system that 1) utilizes solar or waste heat (below 100 C temperature) as a main source of energy, 2) eliminates the mechanical compressor, which is a main user of electricity and the main contributor to maintenance and reliability issues in cooling systems and 3) operates without any ozone depletion effects and any greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, when used with natural refrigerants. Until recently, ejector use in refrigeration systems was considered as controversial because most of the research conducted inÂ the past has yielded only theoretical results without visible, commercial products. The main issue was a relatively low value of coefficient of performance (COP) in comparison with classical compression systems. Selection of the working fluid for the refrigeration or air-conditioning system is the crucial problem because the system efficiency is strongly influenced by the thermodynamic properties of the refrigerant. We found that the maximum efficiency can be achieved with natural refrigerants, of which isobutane {{is by far the most}} favorable. However, primarily due to its flammable nature, isobutane is not currently allowed in commercial systems in USA and Canada although it has been used for many years in all domestic refrigerators in Germany and other EU countries where appropriate safety precautions and regulations were developed. For US market, we identified two other environmentally friendly equivalents to isobutane: R 245 fa and R 1234 ze both with zero ozone depletion potential. The research described here had overcome another limitation - a lack of appropriate methods for the design of ejector geometry. Such methodology was developed and tested in a variety of thermodynamic cycles for cooling, heating and heat pumps. The test stand and the experimental results of investigation for isobutane as a working fluid along with CFD modelling results are shown and discussed in the paper in details. ...|$|R
