Unlike cooked mode {{it works with}} single {{characters}} at a time, rather than forcing a wait for a whole line and then feeding the line in all at once. Unlike <b>raw</b> <b>mode,</b> keystrokes like abort (usually Control-C) are still processed by the terminal and will interrupt the process.|$|E

And indeed, since emacs had to use this <b>raw</b> <b>mode,</b> which implies a context switch at the reception of each character typed, it was constantly swapping when the computers hadn't enough memory to keep emacs and all the other programs in core.|$|E

5000|$|When a disc {{image of}} a CD-ROM is created, {{this can be done}} in either [...] "raw" [...] mode (extracting 2,352 bytes per sector, {{independent}} of the internal structure), or obtaining only the sector's useful data (2,048/2,336/2,352/2,324 bytes depending on the CD-ROM mode). The file size of a disc image created in <b>raw</b> <b>mode</b> is always a multiple of 2,352 bytes (the size of a block). Disc image formats that store raw CD-ROM sectors include CCD/IMG, CUE/BIN, and MDS/MDF. The size of a disc image created from the data in the sectors will depend on the type of sectors it is using. For example, if a CD-ROM mode 1 image is created by extracting only each sector's data, its size will be a multiple of 2,048; this is usually the case for ISO disc images.|$|E

40|$|Venus is a non-magnetized {{planet that}} {{possesses}} a dense atmosphere. These characteristics {{are common to}} Mars and Titan and form the fundamental basis for categorizing celestial bodies {{in terms of how}} the solar wind interact to their upper atmospheres. ENA imaging has been considered as a powerful tool to remotely study a celestial object’s interaction with the space plasma environment. Studies have shown that ENA imaging can be used to diagnose plasma processes in the global scale such as characterization of solar wind interaction processes with non-magnetized planets. In this study, the <b>raw</b> <b>mode</b> data from Neutral Particle Detector (NPD) on-board the Venus Express was used. By using Time-of-flight (TOF) data, the peak of TOF within the range of 100 - 600 ns was mapped to a global figure of Venus. The corresponding maximum of the count rate and Half-Width-Half-Maximum were also mapped for analysis. Results show the various features that can be characterized by their respective energies and count rates, i. e. the dependence of the TOF measurements on the space and time in the vicinity of Venus. These energies agree with the theoretical values if the source signals are ENAs in origin...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{protection}} and the security of data transited within computer networks represent a real challenge for developers of computer applications and network administrators. The Intrusion Detection System and Intrusion Prevention System are the reliable techniques for a Good security. Any detected intrusion is based on data collection. So, the collection of an important and significant traffic on the monitored systems is an interesting feature. Thus, the first task of Intrusion Detection System and Intrusion Prevention System is to collect information’s basis to treat and analyze them, and to make accurate decisions. Network analysis {{can be used to}} improve networks performances and their security, {{but it can also be}} used for malicious tasks. Our main goal in this article is to design a reliable and powerful network sniffer, called PcapSockS, based on pcap language and sockets, able to intercept traffic in three modes: connected, connectionless and <b>raw</b> <b>mode.</b> We start with the performances assessment performed on a list of most expanded and most recently used network sniffers. The study will be completed by a classification of these sniffers related to computer security objectives based on parameters library (libpcap/winpcap or libnet), filtering, availability, software or hardware, alert and real time. The PcapSockS provides a nice performance integrating reliable sniffing mechanisms that allow a supervision taking into account some low and high-level protocols for TCP and UDP network communications...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the first {{contiguous}} high-resolution spectra of the Earth's polarisation observed by a satellite instrument. The {{measurements of the}} Stokes fraction Q/I are performed by the spectrometer GOME- 2 onboard the MetOp-A satellite. Polarisation measurements by GOME- 2 are performed by onboard polarisation measurement devices (PMDs) and the high-resolution measurements discussed in this paper are taken in the special "PMD RAW" mode of operation. The spectral resolution of these PMD RAW polarisation measurements varies from 3 nm in the ultraviolet (UV) to 35 nm in the near-infrared wavelength range. We first compare measurements of the polarisation from cloud-free scenes with radiative transfer calculations {{for a number of}} cases. We find good agreement but also a spectral discrepancy at 800 nm, which we attribute to remaining imperfections in the calibration key data. Secondly, we study the polarisation of scenes with special scattering geometries that normally lead to near-zero Q/I. The GOME- 2 polarisation spectra indeed show this behaviour and confirm the existence of the small discrepancy found earlier. Thirdly, we study the Earth polarisation for a variety of scenes. This provides a blueprint of Q/I over land and sea surfaces for various degrees of cloud cover. Fourthly, we compare the spectral dependence of measurements of Q/I in the UV with the generalised distribution function proposed by Schutgens and Stammes (2002) to describe the shape of the UV polarisation spectrum. The GOME- 2 data confirm that these functions match the spectral behaviour captured by the GOME- 2 PMD <b>RAW</b> <b>mode...</b>|$|E
