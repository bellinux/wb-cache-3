5000|$|The Humber Sceptre MK I, {{introduced}} in 1963, was a luxury car {{based on the}} Hillman Super Minx. It featured a unique roof, glass and upper/rear bodywork not shared with the Super Minx or the related Singer Vogue. The Sceptre was originally intended as a four-door replacement for the Sunbeam Rapier, but was launched as a Humber, while the Rapier continued in production with little modification until 1967. This resulted in the Sceptre being more sporty in character than traditional Humbers. The Sceptre was positioned {{at the top of}} the mid-range Rootes Group cars, above the Hillman Super Minx and Singer Vogue. It featured similar twin headlight styling to the Vogue and a more powerful [...] version of the [...] Minx engine. The high level of equipment included disc front brakes, overdrive, screen washers, <b>reversing</b> <b>lamp,</b> rev counter and a full range of instruments. Automatic transmission was made available later. A MK IA was {{introduced in}} 1964. [...] Whilst the Super Minx and Vogue received revised six light styling in 1964, the Sceptre body continued unchanged until 1965 when it was replaced by the MK II. Production of the MK I and IA models totaled 17,011 units.|$|E
50|$|The 2001 and 2002 models {{follow a}} recent trend among cars {{intended}} to be sold in many markets, in that their rear lamps are asymmetric, with the fog <b>lamp</b> and <b>reverse</b> <b>lamp</b> occupying complementary spots on the driver's side and passenger side respectively; consequently, the rear lamps differ between left- and right-hand drive examples.|$|R
50|$|Both {{variants}} {{started with}} a wheelbase of 2425 mm, but from 1964 the wheelbase of Fiat 1500 was increased to 2505 mm. This longer version was called the 1500 C and also received three more horsepower (for a total of 75) and various other detail differences, including power brakes and bigger taillights with built-in <b>reverse</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vehicles are {{equipped}} {{with a variety of}} lights and reflectors to mark their presence, position, width, length, and direction of travel as well as to convey the driver's intent and actions to other drivers. These include the vehicle's headlamps, front and rear position lamps, side marker lights and reflectors, turn signals, stop (brake) <b>lamps,</b> and <b>reversing</b> <b>lamps.</b> School buses and Semi-trailer trucks in North America are required to bear retroreflective strips outlining their side and rear perimeters for greater conspicuity at night.|$|R

50|$|For 1992, the LeBaron sedan {{was split}} into three trim levels: base, LX and Landau. The new entry model {{eliminated}} the previously standard V6 engine and landau vinyl roof while the Landau model still included the landau roof as standard. The LX, available one year only, offered standard V6 but no landau roof. For 1993, the LeBaron sedan received new rear lights, which incorporated the <b>reversing</b> <b>lamps</b> previously {{located in the}} bumper fascia. Also that year, the lineup was reduced to two trim levels with the entry model now labeled LE.|$|R
5000|$|The 1970 models got {{completely}} new {{front and rear}} styling that included expensive-to-make loop bumpers front and rear. In the front, the new bumper enclosed a new diecast grille and the headlamps. At the rear, the double-loop bumper enclosed the taillamps. <b>Reversing</b> <b>lamps</b> were moved up into the endcaps that terminated the quarter panels, in slotted body-color housings.The designers chose to emphasize {{the length of the}} hood this year, which meant that the redesigned front end grew by three inches. However, the new rear end was four inches (102 mm) shorter.|$|R
5000|$|The Perdana V6 {{was given}} a major {{facelift}} in January 26, 2003. It received a new front grille similar to the alfa romeo, front and rear bumpers, 16-inch alloy rims, tail lights and <b>reverse</b> <b>lamps</b> which were repositioned to the boot. Interior-wise, it featured a new steering wheel, redesigned leather seats and new aluminium-effect trim panels. The mechanical aspects of the car remained unchanged. From 2005 onwards, the Perdana V6 was offered with a new cream coloured interior option and more alluring nine-spoke 16" [...] rims. This iteration remained on sale up until early 2010.|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, the Lincoln Town Car would undergo several {{exterior}} revisions. For 1985, {{the model}} was given a mid-cycle facelift. In addition to (slightly) improving its aerodynamics, the design was intended to visually shorten the car (though length was essentially unchanged). The front and rear bumpers were redesigned, better integrating them into the bodywork. The rear fascia was redesigned; distinguished by redesigned taillamps, the trunklid was better integrated with the rear fenders. For 1986, to meet federal regulations, a center brake light was added in the rear window. For 1988, the grille was updated with a brushed-metal panel between the taillamps, which now featured the <b>reverse</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R

25|$|These are {{required}} to produce white light by U.S. and international UN Regulations. However, some countries have at various times permitted amber reversing lights. In Australia and New Zealand, for example, vehicle manufacturers were faced {{with the task of}} localising American cars originally equipped with combination red brake/turn signal <b>lamps</b> and white <b>reversing</b> lights. Those countries' regulations permitted the amber rear turn signals to burn steadily as reversing lights, so automakers and importers were able to combine the (mandatorily amber) rear turn signal and (optionally amber) reversing light function, and so comply with the regulations without the need for additional lighting devices. Both countries presently require white reversing lights, so the combination amber turn/reverse light is no longer permitted on new vehicles. The U.S. state of Washington presently permits <b>reversing</b> <b>lamps</b> to emit white or amber light.|$|R
5000|$|Fender and hood {{stampings}} {{were similar}} to the 1960-'61 items, but neither identical nor interchangeable. At the rear, the cat's-eye tail lamps were deleted. A wraparound stainless trim {{was applied to the}} tailfins, below which were placed round tail lamps set into stamped aluminum bezels. These occupied the space formerly available for optional <b>reversing</b> <b>lamps,</b> which for 1962 flanked the license plate below the rear bumper. The spare-tire stamping was eliminated from the deck lid, which was now a smooth stamping with a small central ridge at its trailing edge. On V200 deck lids, a large round emblem surrounded an oblong block-letter [...] "VALIANT" [...] callout on a black field. Similar block-letter/black-field callouts were placed on each front fender. On the Signet, the deck lid was adorned with a smaller round emblem surrounding the red-and-blue stylised-V Valiant logo.|$|R
5000|$|Cadillac {{celebrated its}} Golden Anniversary in 1952. Changes were minimal - and mostly in back where the <b>reverse</b> <b>lamps</b> were now {{integral}} with the fin-mounted tail lamps, and the [...] "Fleetwood" [...] script {{returned to the}} trunk lid. In addition, the rear exhaust outlets were now {{in the form of}} two wide horizontal slots on the outer edges of the rear bumper. Also new for 1952 were winged crest emblems, mounted on the grille extensions below the headlights. With the addition of a down-draft carburetor, the 331 cuin L engine now produced [...] A revised automatic transmission was standard on Sixty Special, while power steering was offered at extra cost. Sales fell to 16,110 units, while the price and weight both rose, to $4,269 and 4,258 lb shipping weight. Cadillac won Motor Trend's [...] "Car of the Year" [...] again in 1952.|$|R
30|$|To detect Zika virus {{more rapidly}} and accurately, we {{developed}} a novel method that utilized a real-time fluorescence reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique. The NS 5 gene was amplified {{by a set of}} six specific primers that recognized six distinct sequences. The amplification process, including 60  min of thermostatic reaction with Bst DNA polymerase following real-time fluorescence reverse transcriptase using genomic Zika virus standard strain (MR 766), was conducted through fluorescent signaling. Among the six pairs of primers that we designate here, NS 5 was the most efficient with a high sensitivity of up to 3.3  ng/μl and reproducible specificity on eight pathogen samples that were used as negative controls. The real-time fluorescence <b>reverse</b> transcription <b>LAMP</b> detection process can be completed within 35  min. Our study demonstrated that real-time fluorescence <b>reverse</b> transcription <b>LAMP</b> could be highly beneficial and convenient clinical application to detect Zika virus due to its high specificity and stability.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{typically}} include headlamps {{and tail}} lights. Headlamps are white or selective yellow lights {{placed in the}} front of the vehicle, designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible. Many manufactures are turning to LED headlights as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional headlamps. Tail and brake lights are red and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle's direction of travel to following drivers. White rear-facing <b>reversing</b> <b>lamps</b> indicate that the vehicle's transmission has been placed in the reverse gear, warning anyone behind the vehicle that it is moving backwards, or about to do so. Flashing turn signals on the front, side, and rear of the vehicle indicate an intended change of position or direction. In the late 1950s, some automakers began to use electroluminescent technology to backlight their cars' speedometers and other gauges or to draw attention to logos or other decorative elements.|$|R
5000|$|The SE5 {{came with}} the same 3.0-litre Ford Essex engine used in the SE4a/b. This gave the SE5 a claimed top speed of over 120 mph. A Borg-Warner {{automatic}} transmission was added as an option in 1970 and by 1971, overdrive on the 4-speed manual was offered. In 1972 several improvements {{were included in the}} upgrade to SE5A, including a boost in power. The extra 7 hp (5 kW) and maximum engine speed raised performance quite a bit and the GTE was now capable of 0 - 60 mph in 8.5 seconds and top speed was raised to 121 mph. The SE5's flat dashboard also gave way to a curved and moulded plastic one. The SE5A can be recognised from a SE5 at the rear by the <b>reverse</b> <b>lamps</b> which are below the bumper on the earlier model and are incorporated into the rear clusters on the later version (these were also carried over onto the SE6 and later). Badging changes included changing the [...] "SCIMITAR" [...] lettering from a narrow type-style to a fatter one.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1992, the {{exterior}} {{was given a}} minor update with a new grille and slightly redesigned tail lamp lenses (distinguished by a [...] "checkerboard" [...] pattern) for 1993 models. As with the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis, the Town Car received a larger update for the 1995 model year in late 1994. This facelift is best distinguished by the deletion of the fixed quarter glass in the rear doors along with the redesign of the side mirrors (enlarged and changed to body-color). Although the bumper largely remained unchanged, the front fascia is updated as the headlamp clusters are changed to a clear-lens design and separated from the grille. The grille was redesigned, returning to the 1990-1992 design in a surround fitting closer to the body. The rear fascia saw the trim between the tail lamps redesigned, featuring additional running lights, while the <b>reverse</b> <b>lamps</b> were moved from the outer edges of the reflector panel to the center, beneath the lid lock cover (similar to the 1985 - 1987 models).|$|R
5000|$|To warn {{adjacent}} vehicle {{operators and}} pedestrians of a vehicle's rearward motion, {{and to provide}} illumination to the rear when backing up, each vehicle must be equipped {{with one or two}} rear-mounted, rear-facing reversing (or [...] "backup") lamps.These are required to produce white light by U.S. and international UN Regulations.

5000|$|The next upgrade was {{presented}} at the London Motor Show in October 1966. Besides receiving the larger 1275 cc engine (which disappointed enthusiasts by being in a lower state of tune than that of the Mini-Cooper 'S'), the Mark IV and its cousin the Mark III MG Midget had several changes which were more than cosmetic. Most notable is the change from a removable convertible top, which had to be stowed in the boot, to a permanently affixed, folding top of greatly improved design, which was much easier to use. Separate brake and clutch master cylinders were fitted, as car manufacturers' thoughts began to turn to making their products safer. On US market versions the larger engine sacrificed some of its performance from 1968 on, through the use of smog pumps and other modifications to comply with federal emission control requirements. 1969 was the final year the Sprite was exported to the US. At the same time <b>reversing</b> <b>lamps</b> were made a standard fitment and the cars' electrical system was switched to negative earth and powered by an alternator rather than a dynamo. This was also the first year that reclining seats were fitted.|$|R
5000|$|Visually, the 1991 EB Falcon {{remained}} {{nearly identical}} to its predecessor, including carrying over the 3.9-litre Ford straight-six engine and four-speed M85LE automatic. The most noticeable changes were {{the transfer of the}} Ford emblem from the tip of the bonnet to the grille and a full-length applique bridging the gap between the tail lights, featuring <b>reversing</b> <b>lamps</b> {{on both sides of the}} rear number plate. Additionally, the C-pillars air vents were removed. The return of the V8 engine since its demise in the Ford Falcon (XE) of 1982 was welcomed by the motoring press, however, the 5.0-litre Windsor unit did not reappear in the utility variants until the [...] "EF-shaped" [...] XH series of 1996. The V8 was paired to the four-speed M95LE automatic transmission. There were also changes to the front suspension geometry, giving the EB a much better level of grip and steering feel. With the new model, Ford re-introduced the sports orientated GT specification level, an exclusive 250 unit run celebrating the 25th anniversary of the first original Falcon GT. The first XR6 and XR8 sports models appeared in the EB Series.|$|R
5000|$|The Diablo SV was {{introduced}} in 1995 at the Geneva Auto Show, reviving the super veloce title first used on the Miura SV. The SV {{was based on the}} standard Diablo and thus lacked the four-wheel drive of the VT. A notable feature of the SV was an increase in horsepower to , which, paired with the two-wheel drive layout, could increase the likelihood of loss of traction during hard driving. Interestingly, despite its higher power output, the SV was priced as the entry-level model in the Diablo range, falling below the standard Diablo by a small margin. An adjustable rear spoiler was installed as standard equipment and could be color-matched to the car body or formed from carbon fiber. Other exterior changes included black tail lamp surrounds, repositioned rear fog and <b>reverse</b> <b>lamps</b> as on the SE30, dual front foglamps (rather than the quad style found on all previous models), an extra set of front brake cooling ducts, a ducted engine lid similar to that installed on the Diablo SE30 Jota, and optional [...] "SV" [...] decals for the sides of the car. The SV also featured larger diameter front brakes (340 mm) and a corresponding increase in front wheel size to 18 inches.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, in {{relation}} to the Camaro, the Firebird received a mid-cycle refresh for 1998 model year. Major changes included a new hood and front fascia with dual intakes, retracting quad halogen headlights, circular turnsignal and fog lamps, a front license plate pocket, lower fender air vents, unified-style lower door raised lettering for each trim level, and a new [...] "honeycomb" [...] rear light panel, with circular <b>reverse</b> <b>lamps.</b> In the dashboard, [...] "next generation" [...] reduced-force dual airbags became standard. As before, the Formula and Trans Am again received a close derivative of the Corvette's 5.7 L V8, the LS1 of the C5 Corvette, as the LT1 (and LT4) V8s were discontinued. The LS1 Firebirds were also equipped with an aluminum driveshaft, replacing the previous steel version, while all Firebird trim levels gained four-wheel disc brakes with dual-piston front calipers and larger rotors at each wheel, complete with a solenoid-based Bosch anti-lock system. The Formula convertible was no longer offered. Beginning in 1998 for 1999 models, a standard 16.8-gallon non-metallic fuel tank increased potential traveling range. GM's ASR traction control system was extended to the V6-powered Firebirds, and all LS1 (V8) and Y87 (V6) Firebirds also received a Zexel/Torsen II slip-reduction rear axle. An electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) system replaced the old hydraulic proportioning valve for improved brake performance. An enhanced sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) recorded vehicle speed, engine rpm, throttle position and brake use in the last five seconds prior to airbag deployment. In 1999, a Hurst shifter for variants with the 6-speed manual and a power steering cooler became options for LS1 Firebirds. In 2000, the WS6 performance package was available exclusively for 2001 model year Trans Am coupe and convertible variants. For 2002, more convenience items such as power mirrors and power antenna became standard equipment, while cassette stereos were phased out.|$|R
50|$|It {{was well}} {{equipped}} with leather and nylon upholstery for its bench {{front and rear}} seats and woven pile carpet. A heater was fitted as standard. The radio remained an option on the home market. Other options included fog <b>lamps,</b> <b>reversing</b> light, locking filler cap and external mirrors. In {{order to keep the}} front floor clear to seat six people the handbrake lever was mounted under the dashboard and the gearchange lever was column mounted. The car could be ordered painted in either single or two tone colours.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Executive" [...] was an {{upmarket}} {{version and}} had the highest specification offered by Ford to UK customers in the 1960s. Automatic transmission (the Zodiac's four-speed manual box with overdrive being also available as a 'no cost' option) along with power steering and a sunroof were standard equipment. Other standard features included; fully reclining front seats, Walnut fascia, full instrumentation, carpeting throughout, <b>reversing</b> lights, fog <b>lamps,</b> front inertia reel safety belts, and a radio. The Executive was distinguishable from other models by exterior trim and name badges {{on the front and}} rear.|$|R
5000|$|Following the [...] "merger" [...] with Leyland, the new company's board bore {{an uncanny}} {{resemblance}} to the senior management team that had hitherto headed up the Leyland half of the partnership, so comments of the management team on the profitability of the former BMC elements need to be viewed with caution. However, following a review of company records undertaken {{with the support of}} the new board, author Graham Turner stated that at the time of the merger, 16 versions of the Mini were being produced, yielding an average profit of just £16 per car, while every Morris Minor sold lost the group £9 and every Austin Westminster sold lost £17. This helps to explain why the Westminster and Minor were among the early casualties of the merger, as well as the introduction of the Mini Clubman, capable of being built for less, but sold for more than a standard Mini thanks to simplified ("modernised") front panels. Even the UK's best seller, the Austin/Morris 1100, had to be subjected to an emergency cost-reduction programme which removed about £10 from the cost of each car, applying changes that included the omission of lead sealing from body joints (£2.40 per car), removing provision for optional <b>reversing</b> <b>lamps</b> (£0.10) and [...] "changes in body finish" [...] (£0.75). Rebuilding the Cowley plant to include [...] "new automated body building facilities" [...] saved £2.00 in transport costs per car for bodies that no longer needed to be transported from the corporation's Swindon plant and in the longer term further transport costs were saved by concentrating assembly of the model at a single plant, rather than splitting it between plants at Cowley and Longbridge. Because of the high proportion of auto-production costs represented by fixed costs that needed to be allocated over a planned production volume, and the use in the 1960s of investment appraisal criteria that were ill-suited to accounting for volume fluctuations and the rapidly changing value of the UK currency in the 1960s, the precise figures quoted may be open to challenge, but the new management's diagnosis that BMC's profitability was insufficient to fund support and new model investment to cover its disparate range of brands and models was hard to refute.|$|R
40|$|Rapid and {{sensitive}} diagnostic methods based on isothermal amplification are ideal substitutes for PCR in out-of-lab settings. However, there are bottlenecks {{in terms of}} establishing low-cost and user-friendly readout methods for isothermal amplification schemes. Combining the high amplification efficiency of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with an optomagnetic' nanoparticle-based readout system, we demonstrate ultrasensitive and rapid detection of Newcastle disease virus RNA. Biotinylated amplicons of <b>LAMP</b> and <b>reverse</b> transcription <b>LAMP</b> (RT-LAMP) bind to streptavidin-coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) resulting in a dramatical increase in the hydrodynamic size of the MNPs. This increase was measured by an optomagnetic readout system and provided quantitative information {{on the amount of}} LAMP target sequence. Our assay resulted in a limit of detection of 10 aM of target sequence with a total assay time of 30 min. The assay has also been tested on clinical samples (vaccine and tissue specimens) with a performance comparable to real-time RT-PCR By changing the LAMP primers, this strategy can serve as a general method for the detection of other DNA/RNA targets with high specificity and sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella's {{success at}} proliferating intracellularly and causing disease {{depends on the}} {{translocation}} of a major virulence protein, SifA, into the host cell. SifA recruits membranes enriched in lysosome associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP 1) and is needed for growth of Salmonella induced filaments (Sifs) and the Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV). It directly binds a host protein called SKIP (SifA and kinesin interacting protein) which is critical for membrane stability and motor dynamics at the SCV. SifA also contains a WxxxE motif, predictive of G protein mimicry in bacterial effectors, but whether and how it mimics the action of a host G protein is not known. We show that SKIP's pleckstrin homology domain, which directly binds SifA, also binds to the late endosomal GTPase Rab 9. Knockdown studies suggest that both SKIP and Rab 9 function to maintain peripheral LAMP 1 distribution in cells. The Rab 9 :SKIP interaction is GTP-dependent and is inhibited by SifA binding to the SKIP pleckstrin homology domain, suggesting that SifA may be a Rab 9 antagonist. SifA:SKIP binding is significantly tighter than Rab 9 :SKIP binding and may thus allow SifA to bring SKIP to the SCV via SKIP's Rab 9 -binding site. Rab 9 can measurably <b>reverse</b> SifA-dependent <b>LAMP</b> 1 recruitment and the perinuclear location of the SCV in cells. Importantly, binding to SKIP requires SifA residues W 197 and E 201 of the conserved WxxxE signature sequence, leading to the speculation that bacterial G protein mimicry may result in G protein antagonism...|$|R
40|$|Loop-mediated {{isothermal}} amplification (LAMP) is {{a molecular}} method that amplifies DNA under isothermal conditions. It {{relies on the}} use of 4 different primers recognizing 6 regions of the template sequence and {{on the use of}} a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity (Notomi et al., 2000). The addition of two loop primers allows the reaction time to be of one hour only (Nagamine et al., 2002). The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a <b>reverse</b> transcription <b>LAMP</b> assay for an easy and inexpensive detection of feline Coronavirus (FCoV). Six primers binding the conserved 3 ’UTR region of the FCoV were designed with the Primer Explorer software. Thirty-two samples of RNA (11 feces, 8 effusions, 9 blood samples and 4 tissues) on which a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the 3 ’UTR region was performed were used. The reaction was carried out in 25 μL reaction volume and the mixture was incubated in a thermocycler at 63 °C for 1 hour followed by 10 minutes at 80 °C. LAMP products were visualized under UV after electrophoresis migration on a 1. 5 % agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide, where they produce a ladder-like pattern if positive. Results where compared with those obtained on standard PCR. Sensitivity and specificity were respectively 60 % and 100 % on feces, 40 % and 100 % on effusions, 25 % and 100 % on blood, and 100 % and 100 % on tissues. The overall sensitivity and specificity of this method were of 57. 1 % and 100 %, thus limiting a clinical application of this method, except for tissues...|$|R
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} {{is a powerful}} tool for ultraviolet (UV) reactor performance evaluation, since it allows the reactor configuration optimization by comparing the performance indicator [e. g., reduction equivalent dose (RED) ] of various UV reactors. In this study, a new performance indicator independent of the microbial UV dose-response curve, namely particle minimum UV dose (D-min), was introduced, and its feasibility was evaluated in the configuration optimization of 3 -lamp UV reactors for water disinfection. Results indicate that the D-min could serve {{as an alternative to the}} RED in characterizing the UV reactor performance. In general, reactors with a normal (NOR) lamp position pattern (i. e., with one lamp on the top and two at the bottom) had larger D-min values (110 - 193 mW cm(- 2)) than those with a <b>reverse</b> (REV) <b>lamp</b> position pattern (i. e., with two lamps on the top and one at the bottom) (98 - 160 mW cm(- 2)). The largest D-min (193 mW cm(- 2)) was obtained in an UV reactor with a lamp relative distance (i. e., the ratio of the distance between the lamp and reactor axes to the reactor radius) of 0. 4 and an inlet internal diameter of 75 mm, which could be ascribed to a well-mixed flow resulting from an optimal dispersion of the influent flow by the lamp array. The maximum disinfection flow rate of the UV reactor with the optimal configuration was elevated by 47 - 100 % compared to those of the non-optimally designed reactors, which led to an energy saving efficiency of 32 - 50 %.

5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could be reversed. Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to the mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. <b>Reverse</b> thrust warning <b>lamps,</b> which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|R
