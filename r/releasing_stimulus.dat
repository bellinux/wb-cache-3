5000|$|Ralph Frenken {{has argued}} against Karp’s {{recommendation}} {{of the use of}} tight swaddling and the concept of a [...] "calming reflex." [...] The criticism is that the effect of swaddling is not based on reflexes because (1) a <b>releasing</b> <b>stimulus</b> is missing, because swaddling most probably works by the decrease of proprioceptive and tactile stimulation and (2) the reflex response is missing, because any reflex always consists of a movement released by muscles. The child does not move but falls asleep by swaddling. Additionally, no known reflex alters the state of consciousness, but swaddling obvioulsly does. Lactation and breastfeeding expert, Nancy Mohrbacher, collected several scientific studies which demonstrated negative aspects of swaddling on newborn infants.|$|E

This variation is often functional, identifying groups or specific actions on a variety of organizational levels.

40|$|Abstract Three {{hypotheses}} {{have attempted}} to explain the phenomenon of contagious yawning.

This set of experiments sought to distinguish between these hypotheses by examining conta-gious yawning in a species that is unlikely to show nonconscious mimicry and empathy but does respond to social stimuli: the red-footed tortoise Geochelone carbonaria. A demonstrator tortoise was conditioned to yawn when presented with a red square-shaped stimulus. Observer tortoises were exposed to three conditions: observation of conditioned yawn, non demonstra-tion control, and stimulus only control.

40|$|Biogenic amines have {{widespread}} {{effects on}} numerous behaviors, but their natural functions are often unclear. We investigated {{the role of}} octopamine (OA), the invertebrate analogue of noradrenaline, on initiation and maintenance of aggression in male crickets of different social status. The key-releasing stimulus for aggression is antennal fencing between males, a behavior occurring naturally on initial contact. We show that mechanical antennal stimulation (AS) alone is sufficient to initiate an aggressive response (mandible threat display). The efficacy of AS was augmented in winners of a previous fight, but unaffected in losers. The efficacy of AS was not, however, influenced by OA receptor (OAR) agonists or antagonists, regardless of social status. Additional experiments indicate that the efficacy of AS is also not influenced by dopamine (DA) or serotonin (5 HT). In addition to initiating an aggressive response, prior AS enhanced aggression exhibited in subsequent fights, whereby AS with a male antenna was now necessary, indicating a role for male contact pheromones. This priming effect of male-AS on subsequent aggression was dependent on OA since it was blocked by OAR-antagonists, and enhanced by OAR-agonists. Together our data reveal that neither OA, DA nor 5 HT are required for initiating aggression in crickets, nor do these amines influence {{the efficacy of the}} natural <b>releasing</b> <b>stimulus</b> to initiate aggression. OA’s natural function is restricted to promoting escalation and maintenance of aggression once initiated, and this can be invoked by numerous experiences, including prior contact with a male antenna as shown here...|$|E

The results indicate that serotonin can be released from central nerve endings by two mechanisms, differentially affected by the blockade of the membrane carrier system: the characteristics of the Ca(2 +) -dependent release are compatible with an exocytotic mechanism, whereas the release induced by lack of Na(+) or by phenylethylamines and tryptamine appears to occur by outward transport mediated by the membrane carrier...|$|R

40|$|Hatchery supplementation {{of declining}} fish populations {{is used for}} {{increasing}} year-class strength, particularly when fish are released with knowledge of local predators. The ability of young-of-the-year lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) to avoid predation, {{as well as their}} vulnerability to predation, remains undocumented. The objective of my thesis was to determine: 1) whether hatchery-reared, predator-naive juvenile sturgeon would respond to alarm cues from injured conspecific cues, a reliable indicator of predation risk in other fishes; and 2) if sturgeon would learn to identify unknown predators through a Pavlovian-like conditioning with conspecific alarm cues. Releaser-induced recognition learning is a variant of Pavlovian learning in which recognition of a previously neutral stimulus is acquired through the experience of pairing a behaviourally active <b>releasing</b> <b>stimulus</b> and a novel stimulus. Sturgeon were initially conditioned using a behaviourally active stimulus of sturgeon alarm cue, paired with a behaviourally neutral stimulus of novel northern pike (Esox lucius) odour, or were pseudo-conditioned with distilled water paired with pike odour. Following conditioning, sturgeon were tested for recognition of the predator odour 24 hours later. The first population of fish (Rainy River) showed a dramatic antipredator response to alarm cues from the skin of conspecifics, but failed to exhibit learning of a novel predator through conditioning with alarm cues obtained from the skin of conspecifics. However, when Rainy River fish were conditioned with alarm cues from the whole body of conspecifics, they showed strong learning of the predator. Conditioning Wolf River fish to recognize predators with whole body extract had no effect on response to predator odours. However, when the fish were conditioned multiple times there was evidence of predator learning. These results highlight potential opportunities and limitation to life-skill training of artificially reared sturgeon for future conservation initiatives...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} further {{insight into the}} {{regeneration}} process of the periodontium. To achieve this purpose, two research strategies were used. First, the transplantation of PDL derived cells was investigated in an animal model. Second, a more fundamental approach was followed, i. e. developing in vitro model systems to understand the influence of mechano-topographical stimuli on PDL cell behaviour. The results from the in vivo cell implantation study suggest that the transplantation of PDL cells can favour periodontal regeneration in an indirect manner. It is indicated that PDL cells promote the osteogenic process by <b>releasing</b> <b>stimulus</b> factors, which affect the surrounding osteogenic cells. These paracrine effects are considered as a critical consequence, through which PDL cells induce superior tissue regeneration. In addition, the higher expression of gap-junctions in the implanted areas may be indicative of a more intense exchange of small messenger biomolecules between implanted PDL cells and surrounding host cells. In {{view of the fact}} that periodontium is a highly ordered tissue complex, and constantly under mechanical stimulus, we hypothesized that the mechano-topographical stimuli will take as much part in the reconstruction process as the mediating factors. Using our controlled 3 D tissue culture model, we demonstrated that PDL cells realigned upon mechanical stimuli. The cells tended to shift their orientation always in favour of mechanical loading, even when they were cultured on a nano-patterned substrate surface to which the cells usually adapt their morphology at static condition. It is clear that current tissue engineering strategies holds promise to achieve full regeneration. However, before it is feasible for clinical application, a thorough understanding of underlying cellular processes in periodontal regeneration is required. The development of advanced cell culture systems, closely mimicking multiple aspects of the local environment of the tissue, can play an important role in achieving such understanding...|$|E

In the present study, the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis of adult female mice selected for paw preference (left-handers vs. right-handers) was assessed by measuring both adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone plasma levels, as well as the in vitro responses of hypothalamus and adrenocortical cells to various hormone <b>releasing</b> <b>stimuli.</b> The results reported here showed no difference in the activity of the HPA axis between left- and right-handed mice, suggesting that this neuroendocrine axis is not implicated in the association between functional brain asymmetry and immune reactivity.

The study was repeated after 2 weeks of increased sodium intake (200 mEq/day). Under basal conditions, EDLF- 1 by RRA and I-Oua were similar in adrenalectomized patients and in controls and were not significantly modified by saline infusion. After 15 days of high sodium intake, basal plasma EDLF- 1 and I-Oua were not significantly different from prediet levels, both in adrenalectomized patients and controls and were likewise unaffected by saline loading. Saline infusion, by contrast, significantly (P ≤. 05) suppressed hematocrit and PRA and increased ANP both in controls and in patients, either before or after prolonged high dietary sodium. Plasma aldosterone (ALD) was similarly reduced (P <. 001) in controls and, as expected, was undetectable in adrenalectomized patients. Our data indicate that in adrenalectomized patients circulating levels of EDLF- 1 and I-Oua {{are similar to those of}} controls and that, in both groups, acute saline loading before and after sodium repletion does not influence circulating levels of these compounds.

Salusin-β was abundantly present in the plasma of healthy volunteers, ranging from 1. 9 to 6. 6 nmol/L.

40|$|SummarySingle {{mechanically}} skinned extensor digitorum longus (EDL) rat fibres {{were used}} as a model to study the influence of functional t-tubules on the properties of RyR 1 in adult skeletal muscle. Fibres were superfused with solutions approximating to the intracellular milieu. Following skinning, the t-tubules re-seal and repolarise, allowing the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + release to be activated by field stimulation. However, in the present study, some fibres exhibited localised regions where depolarisation-induced SR Ca 2 + release was absent, due to failure of the t-tubules to re-seal. When these fibres were exposed to caffeine to directly activate RyR 1, regions with re-sealed t-tubules exhibited greater sensitivity to submaximal (2 – 5 mM) levels of caffeine (n= 8), while the response to a supramaximal SR Ca 2 + <b>release</b> <b>stimulus</b> was uniform (n= 8, p< 0. 05). This difference in RyR 1 sensitivity was unaffected by sustained depolarisation of the t-tubule network. However, after saponin permeabilization of the t-tubules or withdrawal of Ca 2 + from the t-tubules before skinning, the difference in agonist sensitivity was abolished. These results suggest that in adult skeletal muscle fibres, {{the presence of a}} functional t-tubule network increases the sensitivity of RyR 1 to agonists via a mechanism that involves binding of Ca 2 + to an extracellular regulatory site...|$|R

The antitumoral effect of [I- 131]MIBG is closely related to the intracellular level of the radiopharmaceutical compound, which is dependent on uptake and storage/release mechanisms. While MIBG uptake is well characterised, storage and release mechanisms are still controversial. In order to better characterise [I- 125]MIBG release mechanisms, we studied the basal and stimulated efflux of [I- 125]MIBG in the human NE cell line, SH-SY 5 Y, preloaded with 0. 1 mu M [I- 125]MIBG for 1 h. We found that [I- 125]MIBG basal efflux is highly temperature-dependent, that [I- 125]MIBG release, induced by cell depolarisatlon with high potassium, is mainly calcium-independent, and induced by exchange with cold MIBG or noradrenaline, inversion of the sodium gradient across the cell membrane by veratridine or by substitution of sodium chloride with equimolar concentration of lithium chloride. The exposure of NE cells to imipramine, an Uptake- 1 inhibitor, also produces a net stimulatory effect on [I- 125]MIBG release. However, when used in association with other <b>releasing</b> <b>stimuli,</b> such as higher levels of intracellular sodium or external agonists, imipramine abolishes the consequent increase of [I- 125]MIBG release. Our findings suggest that stimulated [I- 125]MIBG release is mediated by a carrier, most probably the uptake carrier working in a reverse mode, while a minimal fraction of[I- 125]MIBG is released by an exocytotic mechanism. ...|$|R
40|$|Some {{aspects of}} {{lateralization}} are widespread. This is clear for {{the association between}} left-eye (LE) use and readiness to respond intensely to <b>releasing</b> <b>stimuli</b> presented by others, which {{has been found in}} representatives of all major groups of tetrapods and in fishes. In the chick, this behavioural asymmetry is linked developmentally to greater ability to sustain response against distracting stimuli with right-eye (RE) use, in that both reverse with the reversal of the normal RE exposure to light. In the zebrafish, the same two asymmetries (normally) have similar associations with the LE and the RE, and both also reverse together (owing to epithalamic reversal). Here, we show that light exposure early in development is needed in zebrafish to generate both asymmetries. Dark development largely abolishes both the enhanced abilities, confirming their linkage. Resemblance to the chick is increased by the survival in the chick, after dark development, of higher ability to assess familiarity of complex stimuli when using the LE. A somewhat similar ability survives in dark-developed zebrafish. Here, LE use causes lesser reliance on a single recent experience than on longer term past experience in the assessment of novelty. Such resemblances between a fish and a bird suggest that we should look not only for resemblances between different groups of vertebrates in the most common overall pattern of lateralization, but also for possible resemblances in the nature of inter-individual variation and {{in the way in which}} it is generated during development...|$|R

Pairs of seals that had never met previously were given intravenous injections of 0. 41 µg kg− 1 oxytocin or saline and were observed for 1 h post-manipulation. The dose was designed to mimic endogenous oxytocin concentrations during the observation period, {{and is one of the}} lowest doses used to manipulate behaviour to date.
