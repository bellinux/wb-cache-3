40|$|RATIONALE: Formoterol is {{approved}} as asthma rescue medication in many countries. The exact {{duration of the}} airway vs. <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> of formoterol compared with another rescue medication, salbutamol, has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the duration of airway bronchodilatory <b>effects</b> vs. <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> of inhaled formoterol and salbutamol in asthmatic patients. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with stable and reversible asthma were given single doses of formoterol dry-powder inhaler (OxisTurbuhaler) 2 x 9 microg (lower dose; LD) and 6 x 9 microg (higher dose; HD), salbutamol (VentolinDiskhaler) 3 x 400 microg (LD) and 9 x 400 microg (HD), and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Airway and <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> were assessed by forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), serum potassium, blood pressure, corrected QT-interval (QTc), and palpitation and tremor scores. Time with clinically relevant bronchodilation (FEV 1 increase 12 %) without clinically relevant markers of <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> (serum potassium suppression 0. 2 mmol/L, QTc-prolongation 20 ms, or heart rate increase 8 beats per minute) was evaluated. RESULTS: Bronchodilation was maintained for 24 h with both formoterol doses and for 7 - 11 h with salbutamol. Maximum bronchodilation and <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> were similar after formoterol and salbutamol, except for statistically significantly larger maximum heart rate and palpitation and tremor scores after salbutamol. Systemic responses were similarly brief for formoterol and salbutamol (7 h). CONCLUSIONS: The airway effects of inhaled formoterol are of long duration, whereas the <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> are of a similarly short duration as salbutamol. Thus, the time with clinically relevant bronchodilation without <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> is substantially longer after formoterol than after salbutamol...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the liquidity impact of an operational disruption preventing a major {{participant in the}} Swiss large-value payment system Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) from inputting any payments from a certain time onward {{until the end of}} the settlement day. We use simulation methods – employing the BoF-PSS 2 simulator developed by the Bank of Finland – to analyse the size and determining factors of the <b>systemic</b> <b>effect.</b> Our simulations show significant <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> in SIC. In terms of payment values, a daily average of 22 % – or 36 billion Swiss francs – would not be settled due to liquidity being trapped on the account of the disrupted participant. However, in terms of the number of payments, the <b>systemic</b> <b>effect</b> is much smaller. As SIC is linked to a variety of other payment and securities settlement systems, these <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> might spread and liquidity interdependencies can arise. The size of the <b>systemic</b> <b>effect</b> is driven – amongst others – by the input behaviour of participants and the liquidity levels in the system. The SIC fee structure encourages early input of payment orders, which, in combination with centrally operated queues, can act as a shock absorber limiting potential liquidity sinks.

40|$|The {{reason why}} {{metabolic}} rate often scales allometrically (disproportionately) with body mass has been debated for decades. A critical question concerns whether metabolic scaling is controlled intrinsically at the intracellular level or systemically at the organismal level. Recently, {{the relative importance}} of these effects has been tested by examining the metabolic rates of cultured dermal fibroblast and skeletal muscle cells in relation to donor body mass of a variety of birds and mammals. The lack of a relationship between in vitro cellular metabolic rates and body mass suggests that <b>systemic</b> <b>effects,</b> not intrinsic cellular effects are responsible for allometric metabolic scaling observed in whole organisms. Influential resource-transport network theory claims that the most important <b>systemic</b> <b>effect</b> involved is body-size related resource-supply limits to metabolizing cells. However, comparisons of in vitro cellular metabolic rates with scaling relationships for in vivo (basal) metabolic rates suggest that other <b>systemic</b> <b>effects,</b> such as body-size dependent biological regulation and tissue composition may also have major, perhaps more important <b>effects.</b> Furthermore, <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> must ultimately act at the cellular level, for example, by induced variation in the function, structure and intracellular densities of mitochondria.

Tattersfield The {{contribution of}} the swallowed fraction of an inhaled dose of salmeterol to it <b>systemic</b> <b>effects.</b> J. A. Bennett, T. W. Harrison, A. E. Tattersfield. #ERS Journals Ltd 1999. ABSTRACT: Salmeterol is approximately eight times as potent as salbutamol for sys-temic effects. This may be because the drug is eight times more potent on receptors or there may be differences in systemic bioavailability. The <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> of salbuta-mol are limited by its fairly high first-pass metabolism, but the oral bioavailability of salmeterol is unknown. The {{contribution of the}} swallowed fraction of an inhaled dose of salmeterol to its <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> were analysed in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Twelve healthy subjects were given inhaled salmeterol 400 mg, inhaled salmeterol 400 mg plus oral activated charcoal or inhaled placebo plus oral activated charcoal on three separate days. Cardiac frequency (fC), Q±T interval corrected for heart rate (QTc), plasma potassium and glucose concentrations were measured for 4 h following the inhaled drug. Salmeterol with and without oral charcoal produced significant changes for all measures compared to placebo. The magnitude of effect following salmeterol alone was significantly greater than that following salmeterol plus charcoal for fC and glu-cose (mean (95 % confidence interval) differences 8 (2 ± 13) beats. min- 1, 0. 59 (0. 04, 1. 13) mmol. L- 1, respectively) and nonsignificantly greater for QTc interval and potas-sium concentration. The differences between salmeterol given with and without charcoal suggest that 28 ± 36 % of the systemic response to salmeterol administered from a metered-dose inhaler are due to drug absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, most of the <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> are due to the inhaled fraction of the drug...|$|R

In this study, we used a recombinant form of phospholipase D (rLiD 1) and evaluated its direct and <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> on the contractility of papillary muscles and in the left intra ventricular pressure of isolated perfused hearts, respectively. In papillary muscle directly exposed to rLiD 1 no effects on force, maximum speed of contraction (df/dtmax) or relaxation (df/dtmin) were observed. In isolated perfused heart, the peak of systolic pressure and the rate of relaxation (dP/dtmin) were reduced in animals treated with rLiD 1. However, the maximum speed of pressure developed during contraction (dP/dtmax) was unaffected. These data suggest that rLiD 1 did not affect directly the excitation contraction coupling or the contractility of the myocardium but its <b>systemic</b> <b>effect</b> can induce reduction in the cardiac performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{expanding}} use of inhaled and intranasal glucocorticoid (Gc) {{preparations for}} treatment of mildto-moderate asthma and allergic rhinitis has {{in the last decade}} greatly increased the number of adults and children chronically exposed to exogenous glucocorticoids. In general, current topical glucocorticoid therapies appear to be well tolerated. However, clinical impressions exist that the response to glucocorticoid therapy varies between individuals, and that there may be individual differences in glucocorticoid sensitivity. We investigated the regulation and functional limitation of the hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in a normal healthy population, and assessed possible markers of tissue-specific glucocorticoid sensitivity. The first study (I) addressed the question whether topical glucocorticoids administrated intranasally affected specific glucocorticoid receptor regulated genes in circulating lymphocytes, as well as affected the HPA axis as measured by 24 -hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) and serum cortisol. Serum osteocalcin was also measured. We found effects on all measured parameters, which were receptordependent and <b>reversible,</b> indicating <b>systemic</b> <b>effects</b> within a biological and physiological range. Although the HPA axis was suppressed, the adrenal response remained intact as indicated by insulin tolerance test. Expression levels of GR and MTIIa mRNA in nasal mucosa were evaluated in the second study (II) and found to be potential tissue-specific markers of glucocorticoid sensitivity, exhibiting differences in patterns of response between individuals. To provide basic information concerning the normal functional state of the HPA axis in relation to pubertal development, growth and gender, we investigated in the third study (III) the basal serum cortisol circadian rhythm in a group of 238 healthy normal boys and girls with an age-range between 2. 2 and 18. 5 years. The study provided evidence of a large inter- individual variability and intraindividual stability of serum cortisol levels. No correlation was found between cortisol and age, gender, weight, height, body composition or pubertal stage. In the fourth study (IV), we evaluated the suitability of the low-dose 0. 2 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and the low-dose adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) stimulation test in assessing individual feedback sensitivity of the HPA axis. We found that both tests adequately differentiated individual response patterns, and provided evidence that the HPA axis has an intrinsic activity that appears to be set for a given individual. In the fifth study (V), we found an inversed correlation between the magnitude of cortisol response to ACTH stimulation and basal cortisol concentrations, indicating an enhanced cortisol response associated with lower basal cortisol concentrations and/or a blunter or subsensitive response associated with higher basal cortisol concentrations. In summary, within the normal healthy population there are differential neuroendocrine responsesto stimulation and suppression that may lead to or be derived from differences in glucocorticoid negative feedback sensitivity. Evaluations of tissue-specific GR regulation linked with 14 PA axis activity may be a way to further explore Gc sensitivity in the human and the pathophysiology of inflammatory disease. A better knowledge of the covariance between central regulatory mechanisms and tissue-specific responses may be contributive to the optimal treatment of inflammatory disorders, {{as well as in the}} selection of agents, doses, and/or schedules for individual therapies...|$|R
