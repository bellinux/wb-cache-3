50|$|An ambush defence is one {{in which}} defence {{evidence}} - notably from expert witnesses - has not been adduced in advance to the prosecuting authorities, leading to their inability to rebut it. The term is used in United Kingdom jurisprudence. Since 1987, the possibility of the ambush defence has been much reduced by The Crown Court (Advance Notice of Expert Evidence) Rules 1987, made under section 81 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which in essence require the defence to provide the prosecution with copies of expert witness reports in sufficient time for the prosecution to consider the nature of and if necessary prepare <b>rebuttal</b> <b>evidence</b> opposing the report.|$|E
50|$|In law, {{special rules}} apply to {{rebuttal}}; <b>rebuttal</b> <b>evidence</b> or rebuttal witnesses must be confined {{solely to the}} subject matter of the evidence rebutted. New evidence on other subjects may not be brought in rebuttal. However, rebuttal is one of the few vehicles whereby a party may introduce surprise evidence or witnesses. The basic process is as follows: both sides of a controversy are obliged to declare in advance of trial what witnesses they plan to call, and what each witness is expected to testify to. When either a plaintiff (or prosecutor) or defendant brings direct evidence or testimony which was not anticipated, the other side may be granted a specific opportunity to rebut it. In rebuttal, the rebutting party may generally bring witnesses and evidence which were never before declared, so long as they serve to rebut the prior evidence.|$|E

40|$|Part I of this Article delineates a {{defendant}} 2 ̆ 7 s right to present voluntariness and credibility evidence against {{his or her}} confession. This section analyzes the basic constitutional framework of how {{a defendant}} can present this evidence and describes the traditional safeguards against false confessions. This background information provides a context for the overarching issue of expert testimony admissibility. Part II provides {{a basic understanding of}} differences between the psychiatric (medical model) and psychological (social model) approach to false confessions. It then examines the types of false confession defenses used by defendants and the interrogation techniques challenged by defendants. Part III reviews the general rules of expert witness admissibility under the Frye, Daubert, and Kumho Tire tests. The question of expert witness admissibility hinges somewhat on how narrowly a jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s expert witness rules are interpreted. Part IV then looks at a cross-section of state and federal cases dealing with the admissibility of false confession testimony. In this section, jurisdictions are divided into four categories based on whether they allow or suppress such evidence. Some of these decisions also involve the scope of rebuttal. <b>Rebuttal</b> <b>evidence</b> is of particular importance because few courts (and fewer articles) have analyzed the issue. Finally, Part V presents a hypothetical scenario, providing analytic context for the entire Article. As a conclusion, this section also details what is required to ensure a fair and impartial trial...|$|E
40|$|Presumptions have an {{important}} role in antitrust jurisprudence. This article suggests that a careful formulation of the relevant presumptions and associated evidentiary rebuttal burdens can provide the “enquiry meet for the case” across a large array of narrow categories of conduct confronted in antitrust to create a type of “meta” rule of reason. The article begins this project by using decision theory to analyze the types and properties of antitrust presumptions and evidentiary rebuttal burdens and the relationship between them. Depending on the category of conduct and market structure conditions, antitrust presumptions lie along a continuum from conclusive (irrebuttable) anticompetitive, to rebuttable anticompetitive, to competitively neutral, and on to rebuttable procompetitive and conclusive (irrebuttable) procompetitive presumptions. A key source of these presumptions is the likely competitive effects inferred from market conditions. Other sources are policy-based [...] deterrence policy concerns and overarching policies involving the goals and premises of antitrust jurisprudence. <b>Rebuttal</b> <b>evidence</b> can either undermine the facts on which the presumptions are based or can provide other evidence to offset the competitive effects likely implied by the presumption. The evidentiary burden to rebut a presumption depends on the strength of the presumption and the availability and reliability of further case-specific evidence. These twin determinants can be combined and understood through the lens of Bayesian decision theory to explain how “the quality of proof required should vary with the circumstances. ” The stronger the presumption and less reliable the case-specific evidence in signaling whether the conduct is anticompetitive versus procompetitive, the more difficult it will be for the disfavored party to satisfy the evidentiary burden to rebut the presumption. The evidentiary rebuttal burden generally is a burden of production, but also can involve the burden of persuasion, as with the original Philadelphia National Bank structural presumption, or typical procompetitive presumptions. If a presumption is rebutted with sufficient offsetting evidence to avoid an initial judgment, the presumption generally continues to carry some weakened weight in the post-rebuttal phase of the decision process. That is, a thumb remains on the scale. However, if the presumption is undermined, it is discredited and it carries no weight in the post-rebuttal decision process. The article uses this methodology to analyze various antitrust presumptions. It also analyzes the, burden-shifting rule of reason and suggests that the elements should not be rigidly sequenced in the decision process. The article also begins the project of reviewing, revising and refining existing antitrust presumptions with proposed revisions and refinements in a number of areas. The article invites other commentators to join the project by criticizing these proposals and suggesting others. These presumptions then could be applied by appellate courts and relied upon by lower court, litigants and business planners...|$|E
40|$|This case {{involves}} allegations regarding {{fraudulent use}} of a credit card and identity theft. Appellant Michael Jezdik (“Jezdik”) and the victim in this case, Anna Behran (“Behran”), met in Las Vegas in early 1997. They enjoyed a brief romantic relationship but soon parted ways. Approximately three years later, however, Jezdik and Behran rekindled their friendship. Behran told Jezdik {{that she wanted to}} purchase a home but {{did not know how to}} do so. Jezdik offered to help Behran complete an online mortgage application at his residence. Behran agreed. Throughout the mortgage applicatiosn process, Jezdik acquired access to Behran’s social security number and other confidential information. Approximately one month after Jezdik assisted Behran with her mortgage application, Citibank received an online application for a MasterCard naming Behran as the primary cardholder and Jezdik as the secondary cardholder. As the primary cardholder, the credit card application required Behran’s social security number and date of birth. The application, however, provided Jezdik’s address and stated that Behran was employed by Southwest Advertising, Jezdik’s employer. At trial, Behran denied any responsibility for the credit card application. She also testified that she never authorized Jezdik to use her personal information to apply for a credit card, never used Jezdik’s address to receive mail, and never worked for Southwest Advertising. Citibank approved the application and sent two cards to Jezdik’s address. Citibank’s statements went unpaid. Upon discovering the credit card account in her name, Behran testified that she directed Citibank to close the account. As part of the ensuing fraud investigation, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Detective John Woosnam (“Woosnam”) contacted Citibank and learned that Citibank lost money on the account. Woosnam obtained copies of three credit card receipts and billing statements revealing seventeen purchases made during a two-week period. At trial, Woosnam made a lay comparison of Jezdik’s signature on a copy of a voluntary statement with the signature on the Citibank receipts. While not an expert, Woosnam testified that in his opinion, the signatures were the same. 2 At trial, Jezdik theorized that Behran opened the credit card account and used his address and computer to complete the application in his absence. Jezdik testified that he and Behran had renewed their romantic relationship and that Behran had complete access to his residence. Additionally, Jezdik testified that he and Behran were indeed coworkers at Southwest Advertising. In an attempt to establish Jezdik’s credibility and good character, Jezdik’s attorney asked him during direct examination “Have you ever been accused of anything prior to these current charges?” 3 Jezdik answered “No. ” Later, in the jury’s absence, the State argued that Jezdik’s “no accusation” testimony “opened the door” to specific <b>rebuttal</b> <b>evidence</b> regarding misconduct similar to that alleged in this case. 4 The district court agreed with the state and allowed two rebuttal witnesses to testify. A Detective Olewinski testified regarding an unrelated ongoing investigation of Jezdik. The other witness was Jezdik’s father-in-law, who testified that Jezdik once admitted to using his personal information to open a credit card account without his knowledge or consent. The jury found Jezdik guilty on one count of obtaining and using the personal identification of another, three counts of fraudulent {{use of a}} credit card and two counts of burglary. Jezdik appealed. On appeal Jezdik contends that Detective Olewinski’s and his father-in-law’s testimony constitutes improper character evidence under NRS 48. 045 and inappropriate impeachment evidence under NRS 50. 085. The State argues, however, that neither NRS 48. 045 nor NRS 50. 085 applies because the State elicited the testimony to rebut Jezdik’s own testimony on direct examination...|$|E
