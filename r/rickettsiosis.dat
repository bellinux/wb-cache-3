5000|$|An eschar ( [...] ; Greek: eschara) is a slough or {{piece of}} dead tissue that is cast {{off from the}} surface of the skin, {{particularly}} after a burn injury, but also seen in gangrene, ulcer, fungal infections, necrotizing spider bite wounds, spotted fevers and exposure to cutaneous anthrax. The term [...] "eschar" [...] is not interchangeable with [...] "scab". An eschar contains necrotic tissue, whereas a scab is composed of dried blood and exudate.Black eschars are most commonly attributed to anthrax, which may be contracted through herd animal exposure, but can also be obtained from Pasteurella multocida exposure in cats and rabbits. A newly identified human rickettsial infection, R. parkeri <b>rickettsiosis,</b> can be differentiated from Rocky Mountain spotted fever by the presence of an eschar at the site of inoculation. Eschar is sometimes called a black wound because the wound is covered with thick, dry, black necrotic tissue.|$|E

40|$|This study {{proposed}} {{the use of}} satellite hyperspectral imagery to support tick-borne infectious diseases surveillance based on monitoring the variation in amplifier hosts food sources. To verify this strategy, we used the data of the human <b>rickettsiosis</b> occurrences in southeastern Brazil, region in which the emergence of this disease {{is associated with the}} rising capybara population. Spatio-temporal analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations was used to identify risk areas of human <b>rickettsiosis</b> and hyperspectral moderate-resolution imagery was used to identify the increment and expansion of sugarcane crops, main food source of capybaras. In general, a pixel abundance associated with increment of sugarcane crops was detected in risk areas of human <b>rickettsiosis.</b> Thus, the hypothesis that there is a spatio-temporal relationship between the occurrence of human <b>rickettsiosis</b> and the sugarcane crops increment was verified. Therefore, due to the difficulty of monitoring locally the distribution of infectious agents, vectors and animal host's, satellite hyperspectral imagery {{can be used as a}} complementary tool for the surveillance of tick-borne infectious diseases and potentially of other vector-borne diseases...|$|E

The likely vector for these 2 infections was identified as the Amblyomma triste tick, a Neotropical species only recently recognized in the United States. Identification of R. parkeri <b>rickettsiosis</b> in southern Arizona demonstrates a need for local ecologic and epidemiologic assessments to better understand geographic distribution and define public health risk.

Using this test system, we found that five human serum samples obtained from patients clinically diagnosed as having sennetsu <b>rickettsiosis</b> were positive for anti-E. sennetsu antibodies. In addition, 29 % of the serum samples obtained from 200 patients having a fever of unknown origin and residing in various regions of Malaysia were also serologically positive. All sera from apparently healthy individuals were negative in the test. Dogs inoculated with cell culture-adapted E. sennetsu developed a significant specific antibody titer to E. sennetsu, and the organism was subsequently isolated from their blood.

40|$|Brazilian {{spotted fever}} (BSF) <b>rickettsiosis</b> {{is the most}} common and {{recognized}} of the human rickettsioses in Brazil. It is difficult to establish the diagnosis of human <b>rickettsiosis</b> infection by routine microbiologic methods, creating a false idea that Rickettsia and Ehrlichia infections are rare and without importance. New tick-borne diseases, like Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis (HGA) and Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (HME), have been described in many countries. These diseases can present symptoms similar to rickettsioses of the spotted fever group, and they are transmitted by ixodid ticks. The first two suspected cases of human ehrlichiosis in Brazil were first considered to be cases of BSF.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} the first Brazilian case of mild <b>Rickettsiosis,</b> complicated by knee monoarthri- tis, in young adult {{bitten by a}} tick on his left leg in Camburi zone, located in São Sebastião municipality, southern coastal region of the State of São Paulo, in the Atlantic rainforest region, Brazil. The patient developed inoculation eschar at the tick bite site associated with enlarged lymph nodes in the left groin, fever, polyarthralgia, headache and macular rash. Twenty days after tick bite episode, he displayed monoarthritis in his right knee. The diag- nosis of mild <b>Rickettsiosis</b> was established by sequential immunological analysis in serum and synovial fluid, using the indirect immunofluorescence (IF) assay for antibodies reactive with Rickettsia parkeri and Rickettsia rickettsii. The mild <b>Rickettsiosis</b> is an emerging zoonosis, that must be investigated by physicians, including rheumatologists, in patients that pre- sent macular rash, fever and eventually arthritis, after visiting the southern coastal Atlan- tic rainforest region in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria of {{the genus}} Rickettsia are obligate {{intracellular}} organisms primarily associated with invertebrate hosts, such as ticks, mites, fleas, lice, leeches, and insects. A few Rickettsia species are capable of infecting vertebrates including humans, to whom they are vectored mostly by ticks (Weinert et al., 2009). In 2005, there was the first reported case of spotted fever group (SFG) <b>rickettsiosis</b> in Rio Grande do Sul, in a patient from Cerro Largo municipality who developed headache, arthralgia, generalized body aches, nasal secretion, and fever 20 days after a tick bite on his back. Since only one serum sample was collected from this patient (during the acute phase), which reacted positively (titer> 64) against R. rickettsii antigens by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), this case was regarded as probable. In 2007, there was the first laboratory-confirmed case of SFG <b>rickettsiosis</b> in Rio Grande do Sul, in another patient from the same area, who developed general symptoms similar to the first case, with no fatality. The case was serologically confirmed by IFA on paired serum samples using R. rickettsii antigens; acute serum was non-reactive whereas convalescent serum gave a titer of 128 (unpublished data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health). Based on these cases, an epidemiological study that evaluated rickettsial infection in domestic animals (considered to be sentinels for <b>rickettsiosis)</b> and asymptomatic humans was performed in the rural area of Cero Largo, where the two cases of SFG <b>rickettsiosis</b> had occurred...|$|E

Serological antibody-absorption tests with purified antigens of R. parkeri and Rickettsia rickettsii, associated with immunofluorescence assay indicated that the patients in two cases were infected by R. parkeri.

Data used to create maps providing tick vector locations was gathered from unpublished and published literature sources that had previously identified the tick vector. Data regarding the number of probable and confirmed cases, age, gender, race, ethnicity, seasonality, exposure, and clinical presentation was gathered from two surveillance systems used by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. Results show that the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis, has been moving and expanding over time, and is now found in 23 Kansas counties.
