500|$|Five C-47s of the 375th Troop Carrier Group {{carrying}} the gunners of the 2/4th Field Regiment {{took off from}} Ward's Airfield after the main force and landed at Tsili Tsili. After {{an hour on the}} ground, they set out for Nadzab. Most jumped from the first two aircraft. The next three aircraft dropped equipment, including the dismantled guns. The [...] "pushers out" [...] followed when the aircraft made a second pass over the drop. One Australian injured his shoulder in the drop. The gunners then had to locate and assemble their guns in the tall grass. Enough parts were found to assemble one gun and have it <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing</b> within {{two and a half hours}} of dropping, although to maintain surprise they did not carry out registration fire until morning. It took three days to find the missing parts and assemble the other gun. At 1515, two B-17s dropped 192 boxes of ammunition. Their dropping was accurate, but some boxes of ammunition tore away from their parachutes.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{discovered}} that a round {{had been placed in}} the chamber and the breech was almost closed at the moment that Sgt Owens came through the fire port. Over 150 rounds of high-explosive shells were stacked and <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing.</b> The enemy had counted heavily on this weapon to stop the Marine landing. They made several determined but fruitless efforts to recapture the piece. Maj Gen Allen H. Turnage, Commanding General of the 3rd Marine Division, said, [...] "Among many brave acts on the beachhead of Bougainville, no other single act saved the lives of more of his comrades or served to contribute so much {{to the success of the}} landings." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once pumped and <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing,</b> a small {{pulse of}} laser light is {{fed into the}} beamlines. The Nd:glass disks each dump {{additional}} power into the beam as it passes through them. After passing {{through a number of}} amplifiers the light pulse is [...] "cleaned up" [...] in a spatial filter before being fed into another series of amplifiers. At each stage additional optics were used to increase the diameter of the beam and allow the use of larger and larger amplifier disks. In total, Nova contained fifteen amplifiers and five filters of increasing size in the beamlines, with an option to add an additional amplifier on the last stage, although it is not clear if these were used in practice.|$|E

Pull up every fuse, and fix fresh detonators to all the charges. Change every man in that gang, and never leave this spot except when the section boss replaces you, until we're <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing.</b> Thank Heaven that {{will be in a}} few more days, and my nerves may hold out that long. I've hardly had an hour's sleep in the last week, Tom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a rum looking weapon {{you have}} got there, Bathurst," [...] Wilson said, as, after {{carrying}} down the spare guns and placing them <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing,</b> they lay down in their positions on the sandbags. The weapon was a native one, and was a short mace, composed of a bar of iron about fifteen inches long, with a knob of the same metal, studded with spikes. The bar was covered with leather to break the jar, and had a loop to put the hand through at the end.|$|E
50|$|Blowing her {{ballast tanks}} only {{attracted}} the attention of the attackers, which began dropping depth charges again, and the U-boat was still stuck. The crew had to run {{from one end of the}} U-boat to the other while the engines ran at full power in order to break the grip of the mud before the U-boat finally began to surface. All torpedo tubes were loaded and <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing,</b> and all guns were manned when U-371, with her batteries practically exhausted, surfaced and ran for safety.|$|R

60|$|Albert assented, and, returning, they {{informed}} the council {{that they were}} ready to undertake the charge of keeping thirty men-at-arms each, always in readiness for service, and for fighting the pirates by land or water. Returning home, preparations were speedily made, and the men enrolled and drilled. A watch-tower was raised on an eminence that was visible from both castles, and a look-out place also erected {{at the mouth of the}} Medway. This was some sixty feet high. A great cresset was placed at the summit <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing,</b> and an arrangement made with the tenants, on whose land it stood, that a man should be on watch night and day. His duty would be to keep a vigilant eye on the river, and to light the beacon if any suspicions vessels were seen coming up. The smoke by day or the fire at night could be seen at both castles, and by a pre-arranged system signals could then be exchanged between Edgar and Albert by means of the watch-tower on the hill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Kurfurst Max Joseph {{being dead}} (30th December, 1777), Privy Councillor Johann Euchar von Obermayr, {{favorite}} and factotum Minister of the Deceased, opened the Chatoulle [Princely Safe, or Case of Preciosities]; took from it the Act, which already lay prepared, for Homaging and solemn Instalment of Karl Theodor Kur-Pfalz, as heir of Baiern; with immediate intent {{to execute the}} same. Euchar orders strict closure of the Town-gates; the Soldiery to draw out, and beset all streets,--especially that street where Imperial Majesty's Ambassador lives: 'Rank close with your backs to that House,' orders Euchar; 'and the instant anybody stirs to come out, sound your drums, and, at the same instant, let the rearmost rank of you, without looking round [for one would not give offence, unless imperative] smite the butts of their muskets to the ground' (<b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing,</b> IF imperative). Nobody, I think, stirred out from that Austrian Excellency's House; in any case, Obermayr completed his Act without the least protest or trouble from anybody; and Karl Theodor, almost to his terror [for he meant to sell, and satisfy Austria, by no means to resist or fight, the paltry old creature, careful of self and skin only], saw himself solemnly secured by all forms of law in all the Lands of the Deceased. [Fischer, Geschichte Friedrichs des Zweiten (Halle, 1787), ii. 358.] ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{too much}} duty to be done, to render all secure, to suffer us to waste much time in mere sympathy. All the top-mast rigging, backstays, &c., had {{to be set up}} afresh, and gangs were sent about this duty, forward and aft. The blood was washed from the decks, and a portion of the crew got along the top-gallant-masts, and pointed them. The topsails were all close-reefed, the courses hauled up, the spanker and jib taken in, and the ship hove-to. It wanted but two hours of sunset when Mr. Marble had got things to his mind. We had crossed royal-yards, and had {{everything}} set that would draw, from the trucks down. The launch was in the water towing astern; the ship was then about a mile from the southern passage into the bay, towards which she was steering with the wind very much as it had been since an hour after sunrise, though slightly falling. Our guns were loose, and the crew was at quarters. Even I did not know what the new captain intended to do, for he had given his orders in the manner of one whose mind was too immovably made up, to admit of consultation. The larboard battery was manned, and orders had been given to see the guns on that side levelled and <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing.</b> As the ship brushed past the island, in entering the bay, the whole of this broadside was delivered in among its bushes and trees. We heard a few yells, in reply, that satisfied us the grape had told, and that Marble had not miscalculated the position of some of his enemies, at least.|$|E
50|$|Simultaneously, Araneda's {{men began}} an intense {{shelling}} against the Peruvians. The soldiers {{ran to the}} windows to shoot from there.

5000|$|In nuclear warfighting strategy, weapons kept at delayed launch status {{are at risk}} {{of being}} {{destroyed}} in their silos {{in the event of a}} nuclear first strike by an adversary. Even if weapons survive a first strike, a nation's command and control system may collapse by the time they are <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing.</b> A 1993 analysis of future improvements in U.S. command and control predicted the United States government might only be able to continue operating for a few hours after an initial attack and would be unable to manage a [...] "protracted" [...] nuclear war, rendering surviving weapons kept in delayed launch status useless.|$|R

60|$|Catiline {{met some}} of his colleagues the same night. They were the very men who as Senators had been present at his confusion, and to them he {{declared}} his purpose of going. There was nothing {{to be done in the}} city by him. The Consul was not to be reached. Catiline himself was too closely watched for personal action. He would join the army at Fæsulæ and then return and burn the city. His friends, Lentulus, Cethegus, and the others, were to remain and be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>fire</b> and slaughter as soon as Catiline with his army should appear before the walls. He went, and Cicero had been so far successful.|$|R

50|$|In March 1900, {{the fort}} was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> {{installation}} of the initial armaments. Sixteen artillery pieces, shipped from the armory at Columbus, Ohio, arrived from Tacoma by barge. A special tramway was constructed to haul the heavy artillery pieces from the dock area to top of the bluff. In March 1901 the guns were moved to their assigned positions and mounted in the batteries, <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> test <b>firing.</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{with most}} semi-automatics, the pistol is readied for firing by pulling back and {{releasing}} the slide, which inserts a cartridge {{into the chamber}} and cocks the pistol.

50|$|The main {{role of the}} Bastion-P is {{to engage}} surface ships {{including}} carrier battle groups, convoys, and landing craft. A typical battery is composed of 1-2 command and control vehicles based on the Kamaz 43101 6×6 truck, one support vehicle, four launcher vehicles based on the MZKT-7930 8×8 chassis each operated by a 3-man crew and holding two missiles, and four loader vehicles; launcher vehicles can be located up to 25 km away from the C2 vehicles. Upon halting, missiles can be <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing</b> within five minutes, and both fired in 2-5 second intervals. The mobile launcher can remain on active standby {{over a period of}} 3-5 days, or up to 30 days when accompanied by a combat duty support vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The {{legs are}} then locked {{in place with}} locking pins. The {{carriage}} is lowered via the hydraulic jack so that the legs touch the ground; integral stakes are then hammered into the ground.

50|$|The {{history of}} the M/16 {{can be traced to}} a letter from the Norwegian Ministry of Defence dated 17 December 1915. After initial design work had been carried out, it was decided to {{manufacture}} one prototype and 12 production weapons. The detailed design work took longer than anticipated, and {{with the end of the}} war, any urgency seemed to leave the project. As a result, the prototype was not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> test <b>firing</b> until 20 May 1920.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{an article}} on an NRA website, other {{concerns}} are that smart guns may make a firearm more likely to fail when needed for self-defense. [...] "Batteries go dead, temperature or moisture can harm electronics and many 'smart gun' designs, such as Armatix's iP1, require that a person wear a watch, bracelet, or other device." [...] Smart guns may also take considerable time to be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing</b> from a [...] "cold start." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1944, {{a hunter}} on {{military}} leave, United States Army Master Sgt. Francis V. Brahler (1907-2001), then at Peterson Field, accidentally found Fluhmann's long-forgotten cave-cabin. Brahler entered {{through a window}} and found Fluhmann's possessions undisturbed and in excellent condition. The body was {{near the center of}} the cabin, as were remains of the dog. The Marlin rifle, <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>firing,</b> was also there. The burial site of the skeleton is unknown. The mystery of what happened to the rancher continues.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the leg, teams made their way at Edificio Copan and found Bloco F where they got their next clue, the Roadblock asking [...] "Who's <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> a <b>fire</b> drill?" [...] One team member had to climb one of three {{stairwells}} on the building's fire escape. Once at the top, they would put on a harness and rappel 400 ft down the building to receive their next clue. The order which they arrived at the top determined the order of descent.|$|R
60|$|Jonas went {{up towards}} the fire. The hearth was very large, and formed of great, flat stones. On {{one side of}} it was a large heap of wood, which Jonas had {{prepared}} the night before, to be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> his <b>fire.</b> On the other side was a black cat asleep, with her chin upon her paws. When the cat heard Jonas coming, she rose up, stretched out her fore paws, and then began to purr, rubbing her cheeks against the bottom of the settle.|$|R
50|$|At {{this time}} these {{printers}} use printers using PZT crystals as micro-pumps to eject the droplets from the nozzles. The crystals deform {{to generate a}} “shock wave” in the fluid inks which in turn ejects a drop from the nozzle.
