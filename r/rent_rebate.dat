50|$|The {{traditional}} {{view of the}} Land War in Ireland {{has been}} of the displacement of a Protestant Ascendancy class and the often absentee landlords. The former ascendancy {{had been on the}} decline since the Great Hunger of the late 1840s, and for them the problem was that previously agreed rents could not be paid after the slump in prices from 1874; some allowed generous <b>rent</b> <b>rebates</b> while others stuck to the agreements and enforced their property rights. Some were already owed rent and many had mortgaged their property and needed the rents to pay the mortgage costs. Many new landlords since the famine were Irish Catholics, but were still associated with the Ascendancy because of their wealth. A survey of the 4,000 largest Irish landlords in 1872 revealed that 29% lived outside Ireland. By then, 43% of all proprietors were Roman Catholics, though the richest owners were mostly Anglicans.|$|R
40|$|Do low-income {{households}} in receipt {{of a public}} housing <b>rent</b> <b>rebate</b> or of private sector rent assistance have enough for an adequate standard of living after paying rents? How have housing and related expenditure for low-income households changed since the mid seventies? This paper summarises a study which uses unit record data from the ABS Household Expenditures Survey (HES) {{to answer these questions}} as well as to provide other housing expenditure analysis such as long term trends in home ownership, the debt levels of low income renters, and their perception of their general well being. The major part of the paper is however concerned with evaluating the effects of rent subsidies on tenant well-being. In public housing over the last three or so decades there has been a progressive move from a residual rent model in public housing (which assumes rents should set at what is left after a household's other costs are paid for) to a rent-first model (i. e. rent is taken out before other expenditures). What does the move from one rent setting model in social housing to another mean for public tenants and how has rent assistance helped private renters? To answer these questions the study used the Social Policy Research Centre (SPRC) indicative budget standard for Australia to determine whether, and to what degree, households fell below the budget standard even after receiving rent subsidy. The findings challenge the notion that income-related measures of affordability are an appropriate benchmark for designing affordability policies...|$|E

50|$|Between 1973 and 1977, the country's {{economic}} situation turned ugly. The government's budget deficit increased tenfold, inflation approached 10 percent, {{the unemployment rate}} doubled, and the current account went from positive to negative - the latter a critical problem {{in a country that}} rises or falls on foreign trade. Despite economic difficulties, however, the government was able to enact a wide range of progressive social reforms, such as significant increases in welfare payments, the indexation of benefits and the minimum wage to contractual private sector wage developments, a system of <b>rent</b> <b>rebates</b> (1975), and a universal work incapacity insurance scheme (1976). The Primary Education Act of October 1974 gave more freedom to school heads regarding the programming of the curriculum, and an Act of June 1974 made supplementary benefits available to unemployed persons who accepted lower paid- work. In addition, a law of June 1976 enabled employees aged sixty, two years after the first date of receipt of benefits (WWV scheme), to continue receiving them until the age of sixty-five. The purpose of this legislation was to improve the financial circumstances of older employees who are unemployed for a long time. In August 1976, job protection was introduced during pregnancy and for 12 weeks following childbirth. The number of years of full compulsory education were increased, and an Act on equal pay in the private sector was introduced. In addition, investments were carried out in social services, such as home care services for families.|$|R
5000|$|The Protection from Eviction Act 1964 outlawed the {{eviction}} of tenants {{without a}} court order, {{and according to}} Colin Crouch and Martin Wolf, did much [...] "to stem {{the rising tide of}} homelessness," [...] especially in London. The Rent Act 1965 extended security of tenure, introduced registration of rents, and protection from eviction for private tenants, making illegal the harassment of tenants. This legislation was attributed to fall in number of homeless families taken into welfare accommodation each year in the LCC area, from 2,000 in 1962-64 to 1,300 in 1965 and 1,500 in 1966. The Leasehold Reform Act 1967 was passed in order to enable holders of long leases to purchase the freehold of their homes. This legislation provided about one million leaseholders with the right to purchase the freehold of their homes. Controls were introduced over increases in the rents of council accommodation, a new Rent Act 1965 froze the rent for most unfurnished accommodation in the private sector while providing tenants with greater security of tenure and protection against harassment, and a system was introduced whereby independent arbitrators had the power to fix fair rents. In addition, the First Wilson government encouraged the introduction of discretionary local authority <b>rent</b> <b>rebates</b> to assist with housing costs, and also initiated the possibility of paying rates by instalments. In November 1969, legislation was passed by the government limiting rent rises following anti-eviction protests.|$|R

As a means of combating sex discrimination within the social security system, the Act provided that in future married women would receive the same level of personal sickness or unemployment benefit. The Housing Finance Act 1974 increased aid to local authorities for slum clearance, introduced a system of [...] "fair rents" [...] in public and private sector unfurnished accommodation, and introduced <b>rent</b> <b>rebates</b> for council tenants. The Housing Act 1974 improved the Renovation Grants scheme, provided increased levels of aid to housing associations (which emerged as a popular alternative to council housing for people seeking to rent a home), and extended the role of the Housing Corporation. The Rent Act 1974 extended security of tenure to tenants of furnished properties and allowed access to rent tribunals. The Community Land Act 1975 allowed for the taking into public control of development land, while the Child Benefits Act 1975 introduced an extra payment for lone parents. A Resource Allocation Working Party (RAWP) was also set up to produce a formula for a more equitable distribution of health care expenditure. Anthony Crosland, while serving as a minister during Wilson's second government, made a decision to reform the level of Rate Support Grant, introducing a standard level of relief across the country to benefit poorer urban areas.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{development}} and outcomes of housing and social security policies designed to make rent affordable to tenants in Great Britain. The primary research questions are first. How has policy changed and Why. and, second. How much have these changes cost, and to whom. The period studied is between 1945 and 1986. Policy development is analyzed through historical examination of documentary archives and published sources. Three themes are used to explore the evolution of policy. First, the development of housing policy is approached by examining the changing priorities between the aims of making rent affordable, the constraint of public spending and of tenure preference. Second, social security policy is analyzed to establish the role of rent in selective and universal benefit strategies. Third, the role of central and local government relations is explored to establish whether the role of rents and subsidies has been one characterised by conflicting aims between these two levels of government. The outcomes of policy are analyzed through secondary analysis of published government data, and through computerised secondary analysis of Family Expenditure Survey machine-readable data. The changing household composition and incomes of rented households is analyzed and compared between tenures. Model rented households are compared over time to assess the changing value of means tested <b>rent</b> <b>rebates.</b> FES samples from 1971, 1976, 1981 and 1986 are examined to establish how the affordability of rent has changed according to three criteria. First, a comparison is made of rent {{as a proportion of}} net household incomes, both with and without means tested rent subsidies. Second, rent is compared to equivalent household net income, with an examination of those who pay high and low proportions of income on rent in the top and bottom quintiles of tenant income distribution. Third, disposable household income, having paid rent, is examined in relation to equivalent supplementary benefit levels. The last outcomes discussed are those associated with public expenditure. Spending on rent support is examined to establish its changing value in real terms. Explanations are examined for changing trends in spending, and the distribution of spending examined between programmes, between central and local government, and between local authority and private landlords...|$|R

No Australian family was expected to pay more than a fifth of their weekly income in <b>rent,</b> so <b>rebates</b> were introduced and still exist today. During the late 1940s, the Commission had thousands of workers under contract or on day labour teams working to build brick, timber and fibro houses for Queenslanders to rent. At the same time, it converted ex-wartime barracks into temporary accommodation for families in need. The camps provided rustic and sometimes unsuitable accommodation - they were army barracks converted into small flats. Bath and laundry facilities were communal. The communities held boxing and cricket matches, and dances. For kids, camp life meant a constant supply of playmates.|$|R

40|$|In {{a context}} of tight housing affordability, {{increasing}} numbers of Victorians are turning to public housing to meet their housing needs. In Victorian social housing, public housing continues to provide {{the largest number of}} long-term tenancies for people in housing need. And it is apparent that the long-term financial viability of public housing needs to be addressed through reforms to the Commonwealth funding model and by finding alternative ways to attract non-government investment in social housing. This report makes 81 recommendations.   These include: Advocating for Commonwealth funding of the difference between market <b>rent</b> and concessional (<b>rebated)</b> <b>rents</b> on the basis that it is a community service obligation – to bring public housing into line with other corporatised government services that provide concessions to consumers, such as electricity and water supply. Improving support for individuals and families on early housing waiting lists – in particular, educational and social support for children in these circumstances. Developing a workforce strategy to build the capacity of workers in the public housing sector to respond to the complex and changing needs of public housing tenants. Considering an external body to handle complaints for public housing tenants. Ongoing commitment to strategies for sustaining tenancies and continued funding for Neighbourhood Renewal programs. A long-term, targeted increase to the supply of Victorian social housing to achieve a progressive target of 5 per cent of total housing stock by 2030 Amending the Planning and Environment Act 1987 to include as an objective a need to support the development and retention of affordable housing Increasing the supply and distribution of new affordable housing, which may include private and social housing, by amending Victorian Planning Provisions to allow for the use of ‘inclusionary zoning’.   Image: report cover / Matt Clare, Mono Desig...|$|R
