40|$|Traditional {{discretionary}} access control, without data alteration operators, applied {{directly on}} ontologies {{can result in}} revealing unintended information because ontologies contain meta-information about objects. As an alternative we provide a constraint logic programming based policy language that can extract, remove or desensitize sensitive concepts in ontologies prior <b>to</b> <b>requested</b> <b>disclosures.</b> Our policies are stratified Horn clauses with constructive negation, and our constraint system uses a finitary system of ZF sets developed by Dovier et al. - and consequently, admits a threevalued Kripke-Kleene semantics. Consequently, it is suitable for safeguarding meta-information stored on the Semantic web using OWL. We show how our three-valued semantics faithfully represents traditional OWL semantics...|$|R

2500|$|SEC is {{specifically}} authorized to issue [...] "point-of-sale disclosure" [...] rules when retail investors purchase investment products or services; these disclosures include concise information on costs, risks, and conflicts of interest. This authorization follows up the SEC's failure to implement proposed point-of-sale disclosure rules in 2004 and 2005; These proposed rules generated opposition {{because they were}} perceived as burdensome to broker-dealers. For example, they would require oral disclosures for telephone transactions, were not satisfied by cheap internet or email disclosures, and could allow the customer <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>disclosures</b> specific <b>to</b> the amount of their investment. In determining the disclosure rules, the Act authorizes the SEC to do [...] "investor testing" [...] and rely on experts to study financial literacy among retail investors.|$|R
