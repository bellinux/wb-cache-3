40|$|Marine {{reserves}} {{have been}} suggested as an important tool for rockfish management and conservation in the northeast Pacific Ocean. One issue confronting effective reserve design {{is to ensure that}} larvae <b>released</b> within <b>a</b> <b>reserve</b> system are not lost through dispersal but actually con-tribute to the population within the reserve areas and beyond. As a first attempt to address this issue for marine reserves in the Aleutian Islands (AI) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA), we modified the particle-tracking module of a three-dimensional circulation model for the northeast Pacific to incorporate simple larval behaviors such as diel vertical migration. We used the model to simulate dispersal of rockfish larvae during peak months of larval <b>release</b> from <b>a</b> suite of potential reserve locations in the AI and GOA. Because larval behavioral patterns are unknown for most rockfish species, we incorporated several alternative behavioral models in the simulations. We also addressed intra- and interannual variation in dispersal by repeating the simulations with larval release occurring during several different months for two different years. Model results indicate that retention of larvae near release sites is greatest for sites in the AI and least for sites in the GOA. However, we regard these results as preliminary and as a demonstration of the modeling approach rather than as an actual basis for selecting reserve areas. 252 Stockhausen and Hermann—Modeling Larval Dispersion of Rockfis...|$|R
25|$|Most {{cylinder}} valves {{are currently}} of the K-valve type, {{which is a}} simple manually operated screw-down on-off valve. In the mid-1960s, J-valves were widespread. J-valves contain a spring-operated valve that is restricts or shuts off flow when tank pressure falls to 300-500 psi, causing breathing resistance and warning the diver {{that he or she}} is dangerously low on air. The reserve air is <b>released</b> by pulling <b>a</b> <b>reserve</b> lever on the valve. J-valves fell out of favor with the introduction of pressure gauges, which allow divers to keep track of their air underwater, especially as the valve-type is vulnerable to accidental release of reserve air and increases the cost and servicing of the valve. J-valves are occasionally still used when work is done in visibility so poor that the pressure gauge cannot be seen, even with a light.|$|R

40|$|Cocaine {{primarily}} exerts its behavioral effects {{by enhancing}} dopaminergic neurotransmission, amplifying dopamine-encoded sensorimotor integration. The presumed mechanism for {{this effect is}} inhibition of the dopamine transporter, which blocks dopamine uptake and prolongs the duration of dopamine in the extracellular space. However, there is growing evidence that cocaine can also augment dopamine release. Here, we directly monitored the actions of cocaine on dopamine release by using electrochemical detection to measure extracellular dopamine in the striatum of anesthetized mice. Cocaine enhanced the levels of striatal dopamine produced by electrical stimulation of dopaminergic neurons. Even after pretreatment with �-methyl-p-tyrosine, which depletes the readily releasable pool of dopamine, cocaine was still capable of elevating dopamine levels. This suggests that cocaine enhances dopamine <b>release</b> by mobilizing <b>a</b> <b>reserve</b> pool of dopamine-containing synaptic vesicles. To test this hypothesis, we examined electrically evoked dopamine release in synapsin I/II/III triple knock-out mice, which have impaired synaptic vesicle reserve pools. Knock-out of synapsins greatly reduced the ability of cocaine to enhance dopamine release with long stimulus trains or after depletion of the newly synthesized pool. We therefore conclude that cocaine enhances dopamine release and does so by mobilizing <b>a</b> synapsin-dependent <b>reserve</b> pool of dopamine-containin...|$|R
