The analysis provides insight into which variables are significant predictors of performance at work.

40|$|Applications in {{distributed}} environments must {{scale to}} {{an increasing number}} of concurrently active application instances. Today’s application servers spend a significant amount of resources on reliably managing state for these instances, turning them into data management servers instead of process servers. The goal of the Demaq project is to overcome the limitations of these systems using a novel programming model for applications based on asynchronous messaging (e. g. Web Services). A crucial aspect of our approach is the representation of state. Messages do not only represent requests and <b>replies</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> and from an application, but retained messages are also used to model the application instance state. This contrasts with most of today’s application servers where two separate data models, languages and stores are used for requests and state. In Demaq, a single, highly efficient, reliable message store is used both for requests and instance state, and a single declarative language specifies message flow and state management. This extends data independence to the whole application stack, thereby improving both developer productivity and - as experimental results confirm - application scalability and performance...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION This study {{analyzes}} the gender {{dynamics of the}} American Library Association’s SCHOLCOMM listserv {{in order to determine}} the accuracy of concerns expressed by participants in early 2016 regarding an overrepresentation of male voices on the listserv. METHODS Utilizing the SCHOLCOMM listserv archive, openly available online, the authors analyzed metadata related to individual messages in order to create a comprehensive list of participants, which was then analyzed to determine gender identity. The authors utilized this information to correlate the frequency of new messages and <b>replies</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the list with the gender identity of participants. RESULTS While men represented 35 % of the SCHOLCOMM list’s participants, they contributed over half of the messages sent to the listserv and two-thirds of those sent as replies on existing message threads. DISCUSSION The opinion of several SCHOLCOMM participants that male voices were overrepresented in listserv discussions proved to be true. The gender identity breakdown of those most active on the list may also influence the perceptions and/or behaviors of other listserv participants, however, and should be investigated further. CONCLUSION While this study substantiates the opinion of several listserv participants that male SCHOLCOMM participants account for a disproportionately large amount of listserv discussion, we argue that the dynamics of the listserv can and should be changed in order to better represent the participant population...|$|E
40|$|Objectives – This study {{evaluates the}} level to which virtual (asynchronous e-mail) {{reference}} services adhere to professional guidelines. Specifically, it addresses {{the following research}} questions: 1) To what extent do virtual reference services adhere to the American Library Association (ALA) Reference and User Services Association (RUSA) and the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) guidelines? 2) How does the level of adherence to RUSA or IFLA guidelines vary based on request type, user name, and institution? 3) Is there a correlation between outcome measures of reference transactions (accuracy, completeness, and satisfaction) {{and the level of}} adherence to RUSA or IFLA guidelines? Design – Unobtrusive evaluation of researcher-generated queries. Setting – Fifty-four academic libraries in North America. Subjects – A total of 324 queries were sent to the 54 libraries, with each library receiving six different types of requests from six different user names. Methods – Researchers developed two coding schemes for the guidelines (34 codes and 12 attributes for the RUSA guidelines and 33 codes and 10 attributes for the IFLA guidelines). Each of the six user names used represented an ethnic and/or religious group identity: Mary Anderson (Caucasian, Christian), Moshe Cohen (Caucasian, Jewish), Ahmed Ibrahim (Arab), Latoya Johnson (African American), Rosa Manuz (Hispanic), and Chang Su (Asian). The six request types were designed so that three would be answered (questions 1 - 3) and three would be out of scope and not answered (questions 4 - 6). The following queries were sent, individualized for each institution: 1) Dissertation query; 2) Sports team query; 3) Population query; 4) Subject query; 5) Article query; 6) Request for a PDF copy. The 324 queries were uploaded into NVivo 2 software, and all e-mail transactions were coded and analyzed. Main Results – Analysis of the 324 transactions from 54 libraries showed the following results: 1) Low levels of adherence to both sets of guidelines; 2) Varied levels of adherence based on request types and user names on both sets of guidelines; 3) Variation in institutional rank according to different sets of guidelines; 4) No correlation between user satisfaction and adherence to either set of guidelines. Conclusion – This study suggests that higher levels of virtual reference service effectiveness could be achieved by automatically integrating some less observed behaviours (e. g., thank you notes) into <b>replies</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> users and by increasing librarians’ awareness of professional guidelines through training and detailed institutional policies. The authors also suggest that librarians should be aware of their tendencies to react differently to different user groups, and that administrators can facilitate this by providing diversity workshops...|$|E

At that time Thibaut was widening his research interest in Byzantine Chant and neumatic notation, to include Slavonic Chant Tradition, first Russian Chant and later that of the Balkan peoples as well.
