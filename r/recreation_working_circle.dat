40|$|Avoiding and {{extinguishing}} {{forest fire}} {{is one of}} the important jobs in the area of forest protection. Under the concept of Prevention is better than cure, finding effective ways to avoid forest fire is essential to reduce and minimize the destruction and lost by forest fire. Therefore the basic fundamental effective ways to avoid forest fire in the area of building up database of all records of forest fires and classificated of potential forest fire risk rating. This study is using Da-Pu <b>working</b> <b>circle</b> as the fields of study, integrated digital photogrammetry and GIS technique to build the geological database of forest fire;using the Analysis of Hierarchical Process (AHP) to construct the framework that reflect the causes of forest fire and calculations of the relative weight value of each causing factor. Furthermore, the techniques provided by GIS on the spatial overlapping method is employed to divide into sectors that the potential forest fire risk rating in Da-Pu <b>working</b> <b>circle.</b> The results are as followed: 1. During the years of 1994 - 1999, the major causes of forest fires in the Da-pu <b>working</b> <b>circle</b> are human-cause. Incendiarism is the main cause. Hunting and improper managing a fire follow as the major factors. 2. Building the geological database of forest fire is fundamental to Prevention of forest fire. The digital photogremmetry can provide the relating forest fire basic information needed for the study including vector, image and DTM these important inputs. Combining this data inputs and information is the basis for constructing the framework and related methods of this study. 3. Through the result of AHP method, the relative weighting value for the first layer of the analysis is 45. 1 % environment related factors and 54. 9 % human related factors. The second layer of analysis point out that improper management of camping fire taking the majority of the causes 33. 0 %. Followed by incendiarism (21. 9 %), weather related factors (20. 3 %), plantation related (12. 3 %), topographic (8. 0 %) and soil related factors (4. 5 %). The above numbers all indicating that human-cause is the main cause of forest fire. 4. this study, using spatial overlapping analytical method in the GIS together with the relative weight value given by the AHP method, calculate and analyze various graphs against and overlapping each other, the result list and categorize the potential risk rating of forest fires happening into five levels including: Slight danger level(4. 61 %);Cautious level (47. 00 %);Alarming level (33. 04 %); Dangerous level (13. 59 %) and Extremely dangerous level (1. 76 %). 5. The levels of potential forest fires happening categorized in this study have been proven right against the past six years (1994 - 1999) records of forest fire. Both the records and the result of the study indicate that 94 % of time when an area is in the sector of Alarming level, Dangerous level and extremely dangerous level forest fire had happened. Not only has this proven the validity of this study but more so in the value of every day use. 6. The geological information system has the functions of spatial analysis, combining graphs and information gathered. It will provide more precise detailed information needed in the area of forest fire management in the future. If combined with more quantitative information in the structure, it will further enhance the effectiveness of the system. This study has already categorized the potential levels in the Da-Pu <b>working</b> <b>circle</b> using digital photogrammetry, GIS technique and AHP method. The result can be provided as reference for the potential forest fire risk rating in Da-Pu <b>working</b> <b>circle.</b> However as for the building of the forest fire records database is a long-term process, it need further in depth investigation. 森林火災的防救為森林保護之重要工作，基於「預防勝於治療」之理念，有效的預防森林火災，才能避免林火造成的破壞與損失，所以建立森林火災資料庫及劃分潛在森林火災危險等級，實為森林防火之基本工作。 本研究以大埔事業區為範圍，應用數值航測與GIS技術，建立森林火災地理資料庫；利用分析階層程序法建立影響森林火災發生因子之階層架構並計算各影響因子的相對權重；再應用GIS所提供之空間套疊分析功能，劃分大埔事業區潛在森林火災之危險等級。所得之結果如下： 一、 民國 83 - 88 年間，大埔事業區森林火災發生的原因多屬人為因子，其中以蓄意縱火為主要原因，其次為狩獵，再其次為引火不慎。 二、 森林火災地理資料庫的建立，為防範森林火災的基礎。而數值航測製圖因可提供森林火災相關的基本資料，包括向量圖形、影像及DTM等重要空間資訊，此亦為本研究建構相關模式的基礎資料。 三、 經由AHP法問卷分析結果，第一階層環境因素之相對權重值為 45. 1 %，而人為因素則佔 54. 9 %。第二階層之權重值，以使用不慎(33. 0 %) 所佔權重最高，其次依序是蓄意方面(21. 9 %) ，氣候方面(20. 3 %) 、植物方面(12. 3 %) 、地形方面(8. 0 %) 、土壤方面(4. 5 %) 。顯示人為因素為造成森林火災的主因。 四、 本研究應用GIS軟體之空間套疊分析功能，配合AHP法所求得之相對權重，進行計算及多圖層套疊分析，將潛在森林火災危險等級劃分為五級，包括I：輕微級(4. 61 %) 、II：注意級(47. 00 %) 、III：警告級(33. 04 %) 、IV：危險級(13. 59 %) 、V：極危險級(1. 76 %) 。 五、 本研究所建立之潛在森林火災危險等級，經近六年(83 - 88 年) 的森林火災資料驗證結果，顯示在第III級(含) 以上之發生機率達 94 %，可證實本模式除理論基礎外，更具有實用價值。 六、 地理資訊系統因具有空間分析及整合圖形與屬性資料的功能，可提供精確、詳實的資料，在未來森林火災管理上，如整合更豐富的資料結構，將可提高其效用。 本研究應用航測與GIS技術，配合AHP法，劃分大埔事業區森林火災危險等級，將可提供大埔事業區森林火災防範之參考，唯森林火災資料庫的建立，為一長期性的工作，仍有待後續深入的研究。圖目錄 [...] - IV 表目錄 [...] - VI 中文摘要 [...] - 1 英文摘要 [...] - 3 壹、 前言 [...] 6 貳、 前人研究 [...] 8 一、 森林火災之探討 [...] 8 (一) 森林火災的意義與等級 [...] - 8 (二) 森林火災之燃燒狀態 [...] - 8 (三) 影響森林火災發生的因素 [...] - 13 (四) 森林火災相關問題之探討 [...] - 13 二、 地理資訊系統之應用 [...] 16 (一) 地理資訊系統之定義 [...] - 16 (二) 地理資訊系統在森林經營上之應用 [...] - 17 三、 航測製圖 [...] - 19 (一) 航測製圖之意義及發展 [...] - 19 (二) 航測製圖的應用 [...] - 22 (三) GIS 與航測之關係 [...] - 23 四、 分析階層程序（AHP）法 [...] - 24 (一) AHP法之緣起 [...] 24 (二) AHP法之理論基礎 [...] 25 (三) AHP法之應用 [...] 27 參、 研究材料與方法 [...] 28 一、 研究地區概況 [...] 28 (一) 大埔事業區地理位置 [...] - 28 (二) 氣候、氣溫、降雨 [...] - 29 (三) 植物分佈 [...] - 30 二、 研究設備及材料 [...] 31 (一) 研究設備 [...] - 31 (二) 研究材料 [...] - 31 三、 研究流程及假設 [...] 34 (一) 研究流程 [...] - 34 (二) 研究假設 [...] - 34 四、研究方法 [...] - 36 (一) 森林火災現況分析 [...] - 36 (二) 各類主題圖之建立 [...] - 36 (三) 地理資訊系統資料庫建立 [...] - 38 (四) 影響森林火災發生因素之篩選 [...] - 39 (五) 問卷設計及調查 [...] - 39 (六) 潛在森林火災危險等級區之劃分 [...] - 48 肆、 結果與討論 [...] 50 一、 大埔事業區歷年森林火災分析 [...] 50 (一) 森林火災統計分析 [...] - 50 (二) 大埔事業區森林巡護現況 [...] - 54 二、 大埔事業區地理資料庫之建立 [...] 55 (一) 地種分類 [...] - 55 (二) 地形資料分析 [...] - 56 (三) 主要林型分佈 [...] - 59 (四) 土壤性質與濕度 [...] - 62 (五) 公共設施分佈 [...] - 64 (六) 氣象資料分析 [...] - 67 (七) 水系分佈 [...] - 71 (八) 影像資料之建立 [...] - 72 三、 影響森林火災發生因素之篩選 [...] 73 (一) 影響森林火災發生因素之羅列 [...] - 73 (二) 森林火災重要影響因子之選取 [...] - 77 四、 問卷調查結果及相對權重之分析 [...] 81 (一) 問卷調查結果 [...] - 81 (二) 相對權重之分析 [...] - 82 五、 潛在森林火災危險等級之劃分 [...] 85 (一) 確立森林火災發生因子之評估準則 [...] - 85 (二) 環域分析 [...] - 88 (三) 套疊分析 [...] - 90 六、 討論 [...] 93 伍、結論與建議 [...] - 95 陸、引用文獻 [...] - 98 附錄 [...] - 10...|$|R

Objective Overview and analysis of cross-border health-related activities in the Euregios. Methods The EU-funded project "EUREGIO" carried out a systematic inventory analysis of cross-border health projects. It is based on written surveys among 53 Interreg IIIA secretariats, 67 Euregios and 328 project bodies. The responses of 122 health projects were considered. Results 37 Euregios or similar cross-border structures established health-relevant <b>working</b> groups, <b>working</b> <b>circles,</b> forums or projects. The cross-border health projects cover a wide spectrum of issues, e. g., education and training, patient care, prevention, and disaster control. Target groups were in most cases medical personnel, patients or decision-making bodies. Four official criteria for cooperation (joint project development, implementation, staffing and financing) are met by the great majority of projects. However, the survey shows a lack of information, publication and evaluation. Conclusions Cross-border cooperation in health is underrepresented in many regions. The project results point to great potentials which should be further developed both in terms of quantitative and qualitative aspects.
