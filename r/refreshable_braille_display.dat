50|$|As of 2011, {{the school}} has an {{enrollment}} of sixty-seven students served by nineteen teachers, forming a student/teacher ratio of 3.5.

40|$|<b>Refreshable</b> <b>Braille</b> {{can help}} {{visually}} impaired persons {{benefit from the}} growing advances in computer technology. The development of such displays in a full screen form is a great challenge due {{to the need to}} pack many actuators in small area without interferences. In recent years, various displays using actuators such as piezoelectric stacks have become available in commercial form but most of them are limited to one line Braille code. Researchers in the field of electroactive polymers (EAP) investigated methods of using these materials to form full screen displays. This manuscript reviews {{the state of the art}} of producing <b>refreshable</b> <b>Braille</b> <b>displays</b> using EAP-based actuators. ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>refreshable</b> <b>braille</b> <b>display</b> or braille {{terminal}} is an electro-mechanical device for displaying braille characters, usually {{by means of}} round-tipped pins raised through holes in a flat surface.

Deafblind computer users may also use refreshable braille displays.|$|E
50|$|Any human sense {{can be used}} as a {{computer}} to human modality.

50|$|Several {{institutions}} {{which produce}} Braille materials distribute BRF files.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} developing a portable Braille device which would allow visually impaired individuals to read electronic documents by actuating Braille text on a finger. Braille books tend to be bulky in size due to the minimum size requirements for each Braille cell. E-books can be read in <b>Braille</b> using <b>refreshable</b> <b>Braille</b> <b>displays</b> connected to a computer. However, the <b>refreshable</b> <b>Braille</b> <b>displays</b> are expensive, bulky and are not portable. These factors restrict {{blind and visually impaired}} individuals from accessing much of the literature which is not available in Braille. The proposed device overcomes the problem of carrying bulky Braille books by allowing multiple E-books to be saved in a portable memory device. Translating text to Braille pattern gives the blind access to non-Braille literature. The single Braille cell design reduces the bulk of the device allowing it to be portable and reducing the cost. A prototype was developed to prove Braille could be read by actuating Braille characters on a finger. The device read text from an SD card, translated it into Braille characters and actuated the Braille pattern which blind volunteers were able to read. The investigation confirmed the feasibility of the Electronic Braille document reader. It also proved the theory that Braille could be read from a single Braille cell by the patterns actuating on a finger instead of the finger sliding across an already formed Braille pattern...|$|R
50|$|Access {{technology}} such as screen readers, screen magnifiers and <b>refreshable</b> <b>Braille</b> <b>displays</b> {{enable the}} blind to use mainstream computer applications and mobile phones. The availability of assistive technology is increasing, accompanied by concerted efforts {{to ensure the}} accessibility of information technology to all potential users, including the blind. Later versions of Microsoft Windows include an Accessibility Wizard & Magnifier for those with partial vision, and Microsoft Narrator, a simple screen reader. Linux distributions (as live CDs) for the blind include Oralux and Adriane Knoppix, the latter developed in part by Adriane Knopper who has a visual impairment. Mac OS also comes with a built-in screen reader, called VoiceOver.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} is conducted into portable Braille devices {{which would allow}} visually impaired individuals to read electronic documents. Consumer research conducted on the existing Braille devices has identified {{the need for a}} portable and flexible E-books reader. This poster describes the design and development of an electronic device that will enable reading of any electronic text document through a single Braille cell. Braille books tend to be bulky in size due to the minimum size requirements for each Braille cell. Ebooks can be read in <b>Braille</b> using <b>refreshable</b> <b>Braille</b> <b>displays</b> connected to a computer. However, the <b>refreshable</b> <b>Braille</b> <b>displays</b> are expensive, bulky and are not portable. These factors restrict blind and visually impaired individuals from accessing much of the literature which isn’t available in Braille. Our design of a novel Electronic Braille Document Reader will overcome the problem of carrying bulky Braille books by allowing multiple e-books to be saved in a portable memory device. By convert text from ASCII into Braille patterns, it will give an access to books which were never published in Braille. The single Braille cell design reduces the bulk of the device allowing it to be portable. An additional benefit of the device is that it can be integrated into a glove and worn thus giving the user freedom to carry on with other tasks while reading. Our investigation has confirmed the feasibility of the Electronic Braille document reader built around a microcontroller system. Portable Electronic Braille Document Reader will provide substantial benefits to blind and visually impaired individuals, and overcome the limitations of Braille books...|$|R
