5|$|So far {{during this}} period, Leeds has seen much development, {{particularly}} in the city centre, most notably the highrise developments such as Bridgewater Place, the developments around Clarence Dock, K2 (albeit a conversion from an older building) {{as well as many}} developments incorporating student accommodation. The 2002 redevelopment of Leeds railway station incorporated a notable steel and glass <b>roof</b> <b>covering</b> the main platform hall and providing panoramic views to the south west from the mezzanine level.|$|E
5|$|The oblique <b>roof</b> <b>covering</b> {{the eastern}} {{facade of the}} Chiayi Station {{features}} a high-tech image. The generator room is decorated with horizontal shutters that reflect a minimalist style. The columns and truss system in the station imitate trees; as they extend toward {{the outside of the}} building, the artificial elements are integrated into nature. When night falls, the ceiling is lit with thousands of lights over the truss system, resembling a starry night over the branches of a forest.|$|E
5|$|The Mahamuni Temple or Pagoda is {{a complex}} of {{structures}} located along a road from Mandalay leading to the southwest. It was originally located on A brick paved road which was constructed from the Royal Palace of King Bodawpaya to the eastern gate of the temple, although only remnants of this road can still be seen. A major teaching monastery of some 400 monks of the Thudhamma Nikaya (order), is one among the many monasteries which are adjacent to the Pagoda. The temple has a central shrine and is framed by an extensive grass lawn. The arcades leading to the main shrine have many kiosks, selling religious paraphernalia such as incense, candles, rosaries, flowers, robes, sandals etc., and various restaurants and tea shops. The sanctum sanctorum, where the large Mahamuni image is deified, is a small chamber and has a <b>roof</b> <b>covering</b> made up of seven pyatthat meaning tiered roofs (derivative of the Sanskrit word prasada). The ceiling has an ornate mosaic covering. The arcades are supported by 252 gilded and carved columns adorned with fine frescoes.|$|E

25|$|The <b>roof</b> <b>covering,</b> {{known as}} s'chach in Hebrew, must consist of {{something}} that grew from the earth but is currently disconnected from it. Palm leaves, bamboo sticks, pine branches, wood and the like can all be used for s'chach, unless they were processed previously for a different use.|$|E
25|$|When {{used as a}} fully {{supported}} <b>roof</b> <b>covering,</b> copper is half the weight (including substrate) of lead and {{only a quarter of}} tiled roofs. This generally provides savings in supporting structure and materials costs. Copper cladding offers additional opportunities to reduce the weight of copper structures (For more details, see: Copper cladding and Wall cladding).|$|E
25|$|Copper {{has played}} a role in {{architecture}} for thousands of years. For example, in ancient Egypt, massive doors to the temple of Amen-Re at Karnak were clad with copper. In the 3rd Century B.C., copper roof shingles were installed atop of the Lowa Maha Paya Temple in Sri Lanka. And the Romans used copper as <b>roof</b> <b>covering</b> for the Pantheon in 27B.C.|$|E

25|$|The station {{building}} {{which stood}} from 1913 to 1971 {{was designed by}} Carl Michalsen, of Ekman, Smith & Michaelsen. The wooden panel building as a gabled roof. On the platform side it had a pillar-supported <b>roof</b> <b>covering</b> part of the platform. The ground floor featured a waiting room, a ticket sales office, a post office and a cargo handling facility. The upper two stories {{were used for the}} line's administration.|$|E
25|$|Manchester Victoria station – Manchester's second station after Piccadilly – it {{has been}} rated {{as one of the}} worst {{stations}} in the United Kingdom and known for its damaged roof since 1996. The station has been undergoing a modernisation program since 2013. A new ETFE <b>roof</b> <b>covering</b> the whole station is being constructed at a cost of £20 million while historical elements of the interior such as the tiled wall are being cleaned and preserved.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1952 the {{architect}} Fritz Berndt began the reconstructions, accomplished by architect Günter Behrmann until 1959. The structures were simplified, the rose window {{was replaced by}} three biforium windows, while the main tower now bears a steep saddle roof. The gable towards Seestraße was simplified due to the new simple saddle <b>roof,</b> <b>covering</b> the main nave, the side naves carry catslide roofs, thus the nave to Antwerpener Straße lost its spire lights. The church was re-inaugurated {{on the occasion of}} the feast of Evangelical New Year (so-called First Sunday of Advent) on 29 November 1959.|$|E

25|$|Wesley Church {{is built}} of {{load-bearing}} brick laid in Flemish bond in the Victorian academic gothic style and features a landmark spire, steeply pitched roofs, parapeted gables, label (hood) moulds and wall buttressing. The church {{has a strong}} verticality of form emphasised by tall lancet windows with plate tracery to the east facade. Angle buttresses divide the nave wall into five bays and the major windows have stucco label moulds above them. The bricks of the building, fired at uncertain temperatures in wood-burning kilns, show a range of mellow tones and, laid in Flemish bond, create a chequerboard effect on the walls, which provides a decorative element to {{the walls of the}} building. The spire is 35 metres high with a weathercock on top; it is surrounded by four smaller spires at its base which are capped by metal finials. The north-east tower replicates these smaller spires above the gable. The roof structure is of hand-sawn timber and the <b>roof</b> <b>covering</b> was originally shingles, but at some point the Church was re-roofed in clay tiles.|$|E
25|$|On 18 May 1945 Berlin's {{provisional}} city council, newly {{installed by}} the Soviet occupational power, had appointed Grüber as advisor for ecclesiastical affairs. This {{earned him a}} bilingual Russian-German certificate, issued on 21 May, to spare him from the usual robbery of bikes by Soviet soldiers, {{so that he could}} move at all in the city, with all the transportation system having collapsed, and an exemption from the curfew valid for Germans, issued on 9 July. On 15 July 1945 Dibelius appointed Grüber as Provost of St. Mary's and St. Nicholas' Church in Berlin and invested him on 8 August in a ceremony in St. Mary's Church, only partially cleared from the debris. Thus his time as pastor in Kaulsdorf ended. In 1946 the congregation commissioned the construction of a simple tent <b>roof,</b> <b>covering</b> the tower stump. Grüber's organisation for the relief of the survivors, today named Evangelical Relief Centre for the formerly Racially Persecuted, found later new premises in West Berlin's locality of Zehlendorf, so the Grübers moved there in 1949.|$|E
25|$|Dyson also {{produced}} buildings with arced forms. The Lencioni house (1985) in Sanger, California, produced a particularly unique two story oval form {{that was also}} widely recognized. Appearing in popular magazines, professional journals, architectural yearbooks, and most recently in a college textbook, the composition was cited by important critics such as Bruno Zevi as a superior expression of organic architectural principles. In the award-winning Tuxford-Barrett residence (1987) in Richland Center, Wisconsin, curvilinear massing was refined {{through the development of}} two successive schemes. Unfolding in shape from a natural resonance with the slope of the hillside, the curvature of the earth-enclosed foundation wall embraced an interior space divided into living, working, and sleeping areas. A terrace extruded by the use of earth from the construction excavation extended the living space into an arboreal setting of trees rooted down grade of the building. This house was also lauded by Bruno Zevi in the same article where he extolled the Lencioni house design. Two unbuilt house designs by Dyson used similar oval pod forms. The plan for the Carlson residence (1981) in Van Nuys, California, occupied an exceptionally steep building site with an integrated system of cantilevered pods. The Millerton house project (1984) in Madera County, California, for a similarly difficult site grouped the pods with a connecting bridge over a rocky cleft and also responded to an environmentally exposed position by incorporating a Teflon <b>roof</b> <b>covering</b> supported by a steel frame for thermal regulation. Dyson further developed a curvilinear form for the Glynns Restaurant (1984) in Fresno, California, that incorporated round light tower elements which would evolve and feature significantly in later projects.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Wentworth, a Salem Councilman, {{introduced}} {{an order that}} would have required all new or replacement <b>roof</b> <b>coverings</b> to be non-combustible. He argued that this was as important as buying new engines or hiring new firemen. After a big fire, many {{of the working class}} would have to live in tents, he warned.|$|R

500|$|The Sunol Water Temple {{is located}} at 505 Paloma Way in Sunol, California. Designed by Willis Polk, the 59 foot high {{classical}} pavilion {{is made up of}} twelve concrete Corinthian columns and a concrete ring girder that supports the conical wood and tile roof. Inside the temple, water originally from the Pleasanton well fields and Arroyo de la Laguna flowed into a white tiled cistern before plunging into a deeper water channel carrying water from the filter galleries to the Niles Aqueduct in Niles Canyon and across San Francisco Bay near the Dumbarton Bridge. [...] The <b>roof</b> <b>covering</b> the cistern has paintings depicting Native American maidens carrying water vessels. The temple {{is open to the public}} Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.|$|E
500|$|Of the ten tornadoes in Florida, {{three were}} spawned in the {{southern}} portions of the state. In The Acreage, an EF-1 tornado caused minor to moderate roof damage to several homes, mainly {{in the form of}} shingles and <b>roof</b> <b>covering</b> torn off. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped near the trunk, along with several branches falling; this resulted in broken windows in several homes. At one home, the garage door was damaged, causing the door to blow in, which in turn led to the roof being damaged above the garage. An 85-year-old woman was injured after being struck by a falling branch of an oak tree, which broke through her bedroom window. A few vehicles were moved from their original locations, while a [...] boat was flipped on its side. Another tornado in Belle Glade damaged an awning and downed trees and several power lines. Further south, a tornado touched down in Broward County and entered Palm Beach County before lifting back up; it resulted in no damage.|$|E
50|$|For bitumen-based <b>roof</b> <b>coverings</b> {{maintenance}} {{also includes}} keeping the tar paper covered with gravel, an older method, currently being replaced with bituminous roofing membranes and the like, {{which must be}} 'glued' in place so wind and waves do not move it causing scouring and more bare spots. The glue can be any exterior grade glue like driveway coating.|$|R

500|$|The {{north-eastern}} end of {{the ground}} {{was known as the}} [...] "Galloway End". It was intersected by a railway loop leading to the Galloway boilerworks. One part of the terracing was known as the [...] "Boys Stand". [...] This was a separate structure, slightly removed {{from the rest of the}} ground and positioned behind the railway loop line which transported boilers from Galloways Boiler Works. The opposing end, known as the [...] "Stone Yard Stand" [...] or [...] "Hotel End", was another part of the ground with an irregular shape. It consisted of a mixture of seats and terracing, and became the most important seating area in the period following the Main Stand fire. The fourth side was a simple terrace, with a <b>roof</b> <b>covering</b> three-quarters of its length. It had a larger capacity than the other parts of the ground, and was therefore known as [...] "The Popular Side". Part of the terrace stood back-to-back with a row of houses on Bennett Street; though the ground was named Hyde Road, its proximity to Bennett Street meant that for some supporters the names Hyde Road and Bennett Street were synonymous.|$|E
500|$|The {{basic premise}} of the episode {{is similar to the}} film Cocktail. Several {{references}} are made to the sitcom Cheers. Collette the waitress is a parody of Cheers character Diane Chambers, and the [...] "theme sequence" [...] for Flaming Moe's, is a direct parody of the famous Cheers theme. Barney Gumble is given a Norm Peterson entrance. Aerosmith sings [...] "Walk This Way" [...] in Moe's Tavern and [...] "Young Lust" [...] during the closing credits. When Homer reveals the secret of the [...] "Flaming Moe", the scene has many parallels to The Phantom of the Opera including Homer standing high up in the <b>roof,</b> <b>covering</b> half of his face. The scene in which Professor Frink analyzes a [...] "Flaming Moe" [...] is an homage to The Nutty Professor. The scene where Bart runs away from Lisa and her friends makes reference to the Alfred Hitchcock film North by Northwest. Lionel Hutz says that a drink can not be copyrighted, citing the [...] "Frank Wallbanger case of '78". This refers to the Harvey Wallbanger cocktail. Near the end of the episode, several bars with names similar to [...] "Flaming Moe's" [...] can be seen. This parodies Ray's Pizza in New York City where dozens of individual establishments have similar names.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} success of Toronto FC led MLSE {{to undertake a}} major renovation of BMO Field. [...] Under a two phase process, the stadium's capacity was increased from 21,566 to 30,000 by May 2015, and a canopy <b>roof</b> <b>covering</b> most permanent seating areas was added and the pitch lengthened to accommodate a Canadian football field by May 2016. The renovations were originally budgeted to cost $120 million, but ended up at $150 million in total. In exchange for a $10 million contribution to the project by the City of Toronto, which owns the stadium, they receive rent from MLSE, while MLSE's management and naming rights agreements for the stadium, which were set to expire in 2027, were extended by 10 years. The province of Ontario also contributed $10 million to the financing. [...] The City insisted that the renovations allow the Argonauts, who had to vacate their current home the Rogers Centre, to move in. [...] The sale of the Argos in May 2015 to a new ownership group consisting of MLSE owners Bell and Tanenbaum was accompanied by an announcement that they had reached an agreement with MLSE to relocate to the stadium for the 2016 season. The Argos contributed $10 million to {{the conversion of the}} field to make it CFL compatible, which was matched by MLSE. MLSE financed the rest of the project, and was responsible for cost overruns. [...] The renovated stadium can be temporarily expanded to a capacity of roughly 40,000 for big events. The Argos purchase agreement called for two Grey Cups to played at BMO Field, the first being the 104th Grey Cup in 2016, and the stadium was chosen to host rugby sevens at the 2015 Pan-Am games and the 2017 NHL Centennial Classic.|$|E
50|$|Roofs {{are most}} often covered with {{shingles}} made of asphalt, fiberglass and small gravel coating, but {{a wide range of}} materials are used. Molten tar is often used to waterproof flatter roofs, but newer materials include rubber and synthetic materials.

40|$|Traditional stone roofs {{had been}} used in western alpine area for centuries, and they still {{characterize}} the identity of the local environment. Actual use of historical housing requests them to be as efficient as modern one, why ancient roofs are often replaced with new coverings, realized with modern products and materials (i. e. small industrial elements, such as tiles). The paper describes the water tightness of <b>roof</b> <b>coverings</b> and illustrates the principal constructive elements which influence the behaviour of traditional stone roofing. The report discusses the results of wind driven rain experimental tests carried out by means of a closed wind tunnel on stone roofs made of gneiss slates, built diagonally according to a traditional technique which is very common at the moment in the area taken into consideration. Particular attention is paid to the project criteria and construction techniques which can easily be applied to improve the water tightness.
