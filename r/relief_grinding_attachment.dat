Chamfering and deburring operations are necessary for many industrial products {{in order to keep}} the edges from being damaged and also to remove sharp edges. The other advantages of chamfering and deburring are high quality finish of the product, safer material handling, increased personal safety. Conventional methods used for these operations consume major machine setting time and also requires skill.

50|$|The {{accessory}} is {{fitted to}} the tool by some mechanism which allows that accessory to be rapidly rotated {{back and forth}} (oscillated). This creates friction with the sanding attachments or rapid cutting motions with the saw and grinding attachments.The narrow angle of oscillation allows for precise control over the tool as it does not kick like a rotating tool can. The angle of oscillation creates increasing friction further {{from the center of}} the tool as these areas travel a greater distance. The increased friction is particularly apparent with the triangular sanding and <b>grinding</b> <b>attachments</b> which allow the operator to reach into corners and confined spaces, a feature unique to this type of power tool. The saw blade attachments use the angle of oscillation in the same way.|$|R

Metal removal rate and surface finish are the important output responses in the production with respect to quantity and quality respectively. The Experiments have been designed by using Taguchi and conducted on Center Lathe Machine model GH- 1440 K of Everest make with <b>grinding</b> <b>attachment</b> with L 9 Orthogonal array with input machining variables as type of fluid, work piece speed, feed rate and depth of cut. Empirical models are developed using design of experiments and response surface methodology. The adequacy of the developed model has been tested with ANOVA and Regression Analysis. The results reveal that type of fluid, feed rate, depth of cut and work piece speed influence predominantly on the output responses metal removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (Ra).

40|$|A new {{theoretical}} method {{which is}} used to define conditions of reducing the machinery cost price has been proposed. This method is based on functional interconnection between the major heads of expenditure. It has been analytically proved that the machining cost price, depending on production efficiency has its extremum (minimum) specified by the cutting tool wear rate. This fact made it possible to determine the optimal conditions of machining according to the criterion of the least cost price. By means of diamond grinding new conditions necessary for machining cost price reducing have been determined. They are maintenance of the optimal cutting <b>relief</b> of <b>grinding</b> wheel working face, that ensures its fast cutting capability and increase in product efficiency. The influence of dimensionless coefficient that determines the dulling degree of a single-point diamond on machining cost price has been demonstrated. Knowing this coefficient, it is possible to compare different variants of grinding in a scientifically grounded way and choose the best one according to the criterion of the least machining cost price...|$|R

So a novel mathematical model of relief surface curve about corner radius end mill, which is verified with a five-axis computer numerical control (CNC) grinding machine and simulated based on a system CAM, is derived and presented in the paper. According to the proposed tool coordinates system and the mechanical coordinate of the machine, the relative motion between the cup wheel and the tool is determined. In order to obtain an accurate relief curve when machining, the model of a cup wheel edge is also introduced. The coordinates of grinding point when <b>grinding</b> <b>relief</b> surface are calculated. With the input data of the corner radius end geometry, wheels geometry, wheel setting and machine setting, the NC code is generated automatically from the program. Then the code is used to simulate in 3 Dimension before actual machining. Finally, the NC code will be used for machining in the CNC grinding machine. The roundness of the round corner in the final product is very well, means this model is effective...|$|R
40|$|Stable {{fixation}} of implants such as {{artificial teeth}} {{depends on the}} direct apposition of bone to the implanted material. While endosseous implants were traditionally allowed to "osseointegrate" over several months without carrying load, clinical and experimental data show that prostheses with roughened surfaces allow successful integration when subject to earlier loading and more challenging implant sites. However, to design implant surfaces for an optimal biological response requires {{an understanding of the}} mechanism by which roughened surfaces promote osseointegration. Research into this mechanism has, to date, focussed primarily on the response of osteoblastic cells to surface topography in vitro. While these have demonstrated some consistent trends in cell behaviour, the fundamental means by which cells sense and respond to roughness remain unclear. It has been suggested that cell responses to changes in topography may relate to differences in the proteins adsorbed from serum (in vitro). While experimental evidence indirectly suggests that physical features can affect protein adsorption, few studies have examined this with respect to surface roughness, particularly as a mediator of cell responses. To address this issue, cell culture and protein adsorption experiments were conducted on a limited range of surface textures. Titanium samples were ground to produce morphologically similar surfaces with three grades of roughness. A duplicate set of specimens were heated at 600 °C for one hour, with the aim of masking potential variations in physicochemical properties with differing degrees of <b>grinding.</b> Osteoblast <b>attachment</b> and proliferation studies were conducted over a short time-frame of 48 hours or less, to highlight the effects of proteins adsorbed from serum rather than secreted by adherent cells. Gel electrophoresis provided a profile of the proteins adsorbed to each surface after 15 minutes, corresponding to the time by which the cells had settled onto the surface. Finally, confocal microscopy was used to examine cell morphology on each surface, and to visualize specific interactions between cellular structures and adsorbed adhesion-mediating proteins. Although the effects were inconsistent, attachment assays showed some indications that fewer cells attached in the first 90 minutes as roughness increased. This inverse cell number-roughness trend was significant at 48 hours; however, the variability in attachment assays prevented reliable separation of attachment and proliferation rate effects. While the reduction in cell number with increasing roughness is consistent with previous reports, it is typically observed at later time points, and thus may be increasingly confounded by contact inhibition and differentiation. Thermal oxidation of the titanium did not impact on osteoblast responses to roughness, although it significantly slowed cell proliferation. The latter result was unexpected on the basis of previous reports. One-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed no significant differences in the composition of adsorbed layers with variations in roughness. However, as expected on account of wettability changes, the heat-treatment did correspond to significant changes in the adsorption profile. While this was not a highly sensitive analysis, it suggests that the cell responses to roughness changes were not governed by broadscale differences in the proteins initially available to adhering cells. In addition to the composition of the adsorbed layer, the distribution of proteins may also vary with topography. The immunofluorescence methods were not sufficiently sensitive to reveal the distribution of adsorbed adhesion proteins (vitronectin and fibronectin). However, the lack of clear labelling does suggest an absence of large accumulations due to specific topographic features. Further work is required to address this issue conclusively. Observations of cell morphology were consistent with widely-reported contact guidance phenomena on grooved surfaces, with elongation and alignment (with topography) increasing with groove depth. Cell elongation was also enhanced on the more hydrophilic, heat-treated titanium, but this effect diminished over time. Although increased elongation at 90 minutes corresponded to lower cell numbers at 48 hours, no causal relationship has yet been established...|$|R
