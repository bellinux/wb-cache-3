An 18. 3 m 4 -seam trawl was netting a considerable quantity of off-bottom fishes. Shrimps predominated in the catches of the 29. 26 m trawl.

40|$|Species composition, {{abundance}} and distribution {{patterns of the}} family Portunidae in the Curuçá estuary in the northeastern portion {{of the state of}} Pará (northern Brazil) were studied bimonthly from July 2003 to July 2004. Samples were taken with a <b>wing</b> <b>trawl</b> net during the day at ebb tide during last quarter moon. A total of 427 individuals were collected, comprising three species: Callinectes bocourti, Callinectes danae and Callinectes ornatus. C. danae was the dominant species (56 %). C. bocourti demonstrated a preference for the rainy season and C. ornatus preferred the dry season. C. danae was present in both seasons. The results indicate that variation in salinity and pH related to season (dry and rainy) are considered determinant factors for the distribution of C. bocourti and C. ornatus...|$|R

It was also found that the four seams net can be developed into a combination trawl for the effective exploitation of both prawns and fish along the coasts off Kakinada...|$|R
40|$|After {{analyzing}} theoretically {{the mechanical}} {{characteristics of a}} sixseam trawl and a four-seam trawl, a series of experiments of both models was conducted in a ferro circulating water tank to compare their relative merits. The comparison of their important performance such as the spread of wings, elevation of headline and total resistance of nets was carried out theoretically as well as experimentally. Since no remarkable difference of the spread of <b>wings</b> of both <b>trawls</b> could be noted even though the <b>wing</b> of four-seam <b>trawl</b> was longer {{than that of the}} six-seam trawl, the conclusion could be drawn that the greater total resistance of the six-seam trawl nets than that of the four-seam trawl nets is much affected by higher elevation of its headline...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} comparing acoustic and bottom-trawl surveys was conducted on Atlantic redfish (Sebastes spp.) {{on the edge of}} the Green and Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Canada. Redfish were on or near bottom by day and migrated vertically in the water column at night. In an attempt to account for biases attributable to the presence of fish in the near-bottom dead zone (DZ), a correction factor was applied based on density values measured within the first few metres above the detected bottom. Acoustic densities within increasing range increments above the bottom were compared with densities estimated from the trawl catch. Swept area was calculated using both the <b>trawl's</b> <b>wing</b> spread and door spread as proxies for the minimum and maximum fishing widths. Uncorrected acoustic densities were significantly higher during the night than during the day. No significant day/night differences for the entire water column were observed after DZ corrections. Close agreement between acoustic and trawl densities was obtained by integrating within the first 10 to 20 m off the bottom, with or without the DZ corrections, for both day and night experiments, but regression slopes differed. Trawl catchability appeared to be density-dependent at night, being higher at lower fish densities. Daytime acoustic estimates were more variable than those made at night, as indicated by consecutive passes of several transects and CVs of density (means of 131 % during day, 35 % at night). We conclude that acoustic measurements made at night provide the most reliable and least variable density estimates, and make recommendations for surveys...|$|R
40|$|Unobserved mortalities of nontarget {{species are}} among the most troubling and {{difficult}} issues associated with fishing, especially when those species are targeted by other fisheries. Of such concern are mortalities of crab species of the Bering Sea, which are exposed to bottom trawling from groundfish fisheries. Uncertainty in the management of these fisheries has been exacerbated by unknown mortality rates for crabs struck by trawls. In this study, the mortality rates for 3 species of commercially important crabs—red king crab, (Paralithodes camtschaticus), snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and southern Tanner crab (C. bairdi) —that encounter different components of bottom trawls were estimated through capture of crabs behind the bottom trawl and by evaluation of immediate and delayed mortalities. We used a reflex action mortality predictor to predict delayed mortalities. Estimated mortality rates varied by species and by the part of the trawl gear encountered. Red king crab were more vulnerable than snow or southern Tanner crabs. Crabs were more likely to die after encountering the footrope than the sweeps of the trawl, and higher death rates were noted for the side sections of the footrope than for the center footrope section. Mortality rates were ≤ 16 %, except for red king crab that passed under the <b>trawl</b> <b>wings</b> (32 %). Herding devices (sweeps) can expand greatly the area of seafloor from which flatfishes are captured, and they subject crabs in that additional area to lower (4 – 9 %) mortality rates. Raising sweep cables off of the seafloor reduced red king crab mortality rates from 10 % to 4 %...|$|R
40|$|The average catch {{per unit}} of swept area (CPUE) from bottom trawl surveys by {{research}} vessels are used as an index of abundance for the demersal fish resources of the Thai waters of the Andaman Sea. The surveys are carried out under the assumption of constant swept area and catch efficiency. However, preliminary investigations showed that the geometry varied by depth and based on other studies {{it is likely that}} this may affect CPUE. To reduce the variability in trawl geometry by depth, the constrictor rope technique was applied. The length of the rope (6 m) and its position (between the warps; 100 ahead of the trawl doors) were based on trials without rope at the shallowest depth trawled during the routine surveys (20 m). Using the constrictor rope at deeper depths gave similar trawl geometry as obtained at the reference depth of 20 m. When the trawl was fished with the constrictor rope 75 m depth, the mean door distance was reduced by 23 % compared to the door distance obtained for hauls without a constrictor <b>rope.</b> Similarly, <b>wing</b> distance was reduced by 18 % and the angle of the sweep/bridles was reduced from 20. 3 to 15 degrees (26 % reduction). The vertical trawl opening was increased marginally (0. 12 m; 6. 5 %) Despite the difference in trawl geometry, catch rates and catch composition did not differ significantly between the hauls made with and without the constrictor rope. The reason for this is unclear, but it is suggested that the larger area swept when no rope is used is offset by increased escape below the fishing line due to the trawl being overspread. Observations by underwater video cameras in the net mouth area during hauls at shallow depth and without constrictor rope, indicated proper bottom contact of the fishing line. It is therefore suggested that the trawl will have similar bottom contact at all depths when the constrictor rope is used. However, this needs to be verified. Observations of fish showed that fish took up position slightly in front of the fishing line, swimming in the direction of towing. Except for a few rays, no fish were observed to escape below the fishing line. Observations of trawl's fish lock showed that this did not function as intended as fish were observed to swim forward out of the codend during haul back of the trawl. v Sections of gillnet panels mounted to the outside of the top panel of the trawl, showed only marked escape during one haul and only close to the codend. The catch is this haul was approximately an order of magnitude higher than in the remaining hauls, suggesting a density dependent escape...|$|R
