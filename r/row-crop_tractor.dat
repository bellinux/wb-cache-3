2500|$|The Model WC was {{a tractor}} made by Allis-Chalmers from 1933 to 1948.

50|$|Many early <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractors</b> had a {{tricycle}} {{design with}} two closely spaced front tires, {{and some even}} had a single front tire. This made it dangerous to operate {{on the side of}} a steep hill; as a result, many farmers died from tractor rollovers. Also, early <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractors</b> had no rollover protection system (ROPS), meaning if the tractor flipped back, the operator could be crushed. Sweden was the first country which passed legislation requiring ROPS, in 1959.|$|R

5000|$|A {{general-purpose}} or <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractor</b> is tailored {{specifically to}} the growing of crops grown in rows, and most especially to cultivating these crops. These tractors are universal machines, capable of both primary tillage and cultivation of a crop.

50|$|From 1949 {{the plant}} made the DT-54 diesel tractor, the main {{ploughing}} tractor used in agriculture until 1962. From 1954 to 1972 the plant also produced a wheel-type <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractor</b> with a tractive force of 0.6 tons-force. In 1962 the T-74 ploughing tractor went into production. The plant produced its millionth tractor in 1967. During the ninth five-year plan (1971-75) the T-150K was introduced.The Soviet era factory {{was awarded the}} Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1948, another Order of Lenin in 1967, and the Order of Georgi Dimitrov in 1975.|$|E
50|$|The International 544 and 656 <b>Row-Crop</b> <b>tractors</b> {{were a bit}} of {{an anomaly}} until International dropped the Farmall brand, in that they {{combined}} some of the customary features of a Farmall (such as an adjustable wheel width) with a utility tractor.|$|R
2500|$|Like other <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractors</b> {{from various}} makers, the WC could be ordered in both {{tricycle}} (narrow tread) and wide tread (that is, wide front track) versions, with the tricycle configuration {{by far the}} most popular. The tractor could be ordered as [...] "air front", meaning rubber tires in front and steel wheels in back.|$|R
50|$|By the 1950s, Vermeer {{introduced}} two new products, {{a portable}} PTO-powered hammermill designed to eliminate flat belts and pulleys and a self-propelled irrigation system that distributes water in large circles over crops. The Vermeer Pow-R Drive met with almost immediate success...thousands were sold. Through these early years, other small farm equipment items, {{such as a}} wagon end-gate seeder and wheel cleaner for <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractors</b> were designed and manufactured.|$|R
50|$|The NAA is also {{slightly}} larger than its predecessors: four inches longer, four inches higher and 100 pounds heavier at 2,840 pounds.For 1954, The NAA was carried over, sans the Golden Jubilee badging (which is popular with collectors today), with only a gear ratio change. In late 1954, Ford introduced its three-digit number series tractors, which further improved upon the NAA. The 600 incorporated improved brakes and wheel seals {{as well as an}} ASAE standard PTO. The 700 was a <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractor</b> that could be ordered with either a tricycle or wide front end.|$|E
50|$|The Model B was Allis-Chalmers' second-generation <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractor.</b> It was small, light, and versatile. The {{combination}} of an excellent tractor and effective marketing helped the B {{to become a}} commercial success. Allis's marketing department had experience with such challenges as convincing doubting farmers {{of the benefits of}} pneumatic tires. Early sales literature for the Allis Chalmers B was devoted to convincing the farmer that the new B required less work to maintain than horses. It was also armed with government-supplied facts and statistics along with Allis's own research proving that the new B cost less to both buy and operate than horses.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractor</b> {{category}} evolved {{rather than}} appearing overnight, but the International Harvester (IH) Farmall is often considered the [...] "first" [...] tractor of the category. Some earlier tractors of the 1910s and 1920s approached the form factor from the heavier side, as did motorized cultivators from the lighter side, but the Farmall brought {{all of the}} salient features together into one package, with a capable distribution network to ensure its commercial success. In the new form factor that the Farmall popularized, the cultivator was mounted in the front so it was easily visible. Additionally, the tractor had a narrow front end; the front tires were spaced very closely and angled in towards the bottom. The back wheels straddled two rows, and the unit could cultivate four rows at once.|$|E
5000|$|Farmalls were {{general-purpose}} tractors. Their origins were as <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractors,</b> {{a category}} that they helped establish {{and in which}} they long held a large market share. During the decades of Farmall production (1920s to 1970s), most Farmalls were built for row-crop work, but many orchard, fairway, and other variants were also built. Most Farmalls were all-purpose tractors that were affordable for small to medium-sized family farms and could do enough of the tasks needed on the farm {{that the need for}} hired hands was reduced and the need for horses or mules was eliminated. Thus Farmall was a prominent brand in the 20th-century trend toward the mechanization of agriculture in the US.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} thirties, Allis-Chalmers tractor {{division}} manager Harry Merritt studied the farm census figures {{and discovered that}} of the nearly seven million farms in America, some four million were of 100 acre or less. Furthermore, the million or so tractors at work on American farms were nearly all on the larger ones. Although the Fordson tractor and then the first-generation <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractors,</b> including the Farmall, Allis-Chalmers's own Model WC, and others, had been gaining significant market penetration and making mechanised agriculture ever more popular, Merritt {{concluded that there was}} a need for four million small, inexpensive tractors to fill the needs of the small farmers still using horses. Merritt set out to build the tractor that would finally put the horse out to pasture.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{benefit of}} the three-point hitch system is to {{transfer}} the weight and resistance of an implement to the drive wheels of the tractor. This gives the tractor more usable traction than it would otherwise have, given the same power, weight, and fuel consumption. For example, when the Ford 9N introduced Harry Ferguson's three-point hitch design to American production-model tractors in 1939, it was a light and affordable tractor competing principally with <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractors</b> such as Farmalls that {{did not yet have}} three-point hitches. At 2500 lb, the 9N could plow more than 12 acre in a normal day pulling two 14 in plows, outperforming the tractive performance of the heavier and more expensive Farmall F-30 model. The hitch's utility and simplicity have since made it an industry standard.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Allis 6-12 and the Moline Universal ended {{production}} in 1923. By then, {{not only had}} an economic recession and resulting tractor price war damaged such companies' finances, but also, the tractor market was evolving. Going forward, newer four-wheel designs (such as the Farmall), which would become {{what we now call}} the <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractor</b> category, would be the focus of the light farm tractor market. Two-wheel tractors would continue to have a place in agriculture both in the U.S. and around the world, but they would no longer compete in the same market segment as the larger four-wheel row-crop designs. However, the Allis-Chalmers Model G, introduced two decades later, was an interesting design that in some respects echoed the concept of the 6-12, albeit now [...] "facing the other way", with the implement leading and the motorized drive unit now pushing rather than pulling.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Farmall {{is widely}} viewed as the first tractor to combine a set of traits that would define the <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractor</b> category, although competition in the category came quickly. Although {{it was not the}} first tractor to have any one of these traits, it was early in bringing the winning combination to market. The traits included (a) 'tricycle' [...] (a single front wheel or narrowly spaced pair), high ground clearance, quickly adjustable axle track, excellent visibility all around and under the machine, and light weight; (b) sufficient power for plowing and harrowing, and a belt pulley for belt work; and (c) all at low cost, with a familiar brand and an extensive distribution and service network. The first group of traits allowed for more nimble maneuvering and accurate cultivation than most other tractors of the day; additionally, because of the second group, the Farmall could also, like previous tractors, perform all the other duties a farmer would have previously achieved using a team of horses. A tractor could yield lower overall operating costs than horses {{as long as it was}} priced right and reliable (and its fuel supply as well). The Farmall, mass-produced with the same low-cost-and-high-value ethos as the Ford Model T or Fordson tractor, could meet that requirement. The Farmall was thus similar to a Fordson in its capabilities and affordability, but with better cultivating ability.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1920, as IH's motor {{cultivator}} died, {{a team of}} IH engineers was {{experimenting with}} an all-purpose tractor, replacing the horse in every job including cultivating. By 1923, they settled on a configuration, and their informal name for the project, the [...] "Farmall", {{was selected as the}} product's official name. As IH management was concerned that the new high-riding, tricycle design—a rather -looking thing to eyes of the early 1920s—might turn off customers, the Farmall was initially released only in Texas, in order to minimize potential embarrassment if the design proved to be unsuccessful. However, the new tractor did its many jobs well and hence sold well, and by 1926, IH was ready for large-scale production at its new Farmall Works plant in Rock Island, Illinois. Although the Farmall never reached the per-year production numbers of the Fordson during the 1920s, it was the tractor that prevented the Fordson from completely owning the market on small, lightweight, mass-produced, affordable tractors for the small or medium family farm. Its narrow-front tricycle design, high ground clearance to clear crop plants while cultivating (helped by a portal axle gearset), power take-off (a feature on which IH was an early leader), and standard mounting points for cultivators and other implements on the tractor's frame (a Farmall first) gave it some competitive advantages over the Fordson, especially for row crops, and it became the favorite <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractor</b> of America, outselling all other competitors (such as John Deere's).|$|E
5000|$|The Allis 6-12 {{entered the}} market {{at a time when}} the {{mechanization}} of agriculture was underway but was far from complete. Tractors had not yet managed to completely replace the horse team for all farm tasks. The product category of <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractors</b> as we know them today had not yet been developed, and the Allis 6-12 had a very attractive value proposition. Unfortunately that proposition was also suspiciously similar to that of the Moline Universal tractor, which had been on the market for about 2 years before the Allis 6-12 appeared. Moline Plow considered the Allis 6-12 a patent-infringing copy. The late 1910s were a period when various two-wheeled and three-wheeled tractors were on the U.S. market. Moline Plow had by no means invented such configurations. However, the Allis 6-12 was especially similar to the Moline Universal, lending credibility to Moline Plow's assertion that it was a copy.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, in North America {{during the}} 1910s, {{tractors}} were evolving away from traction engine-sized monsters toward smaller, lighter, more affordable machines. The Fordson tractor especially had made tractors affordable and practical for small and medium family farms {{for the first}} time in history. Cultivating was somewhat of an afterthought in the Fordson's design, which reflected the fact that even just bringing practical motorized tractive power alone to this market segment was in itself a milestone. This left an opportunity for others to pursue better motorized cultivating. Between 1915 and 1920, various inventors and farm implement companies experimented with a class of machines referred to as motor cultivators, which were simply modified horse-drawn shank-type cultivators with motors added for self-propulsion. This class of machines found limited market success. But by 1921 International Harvester had combined motorized cultivating with the other tasks of tractors (tractive power and belt work) to create the Farmall, the general-purpose tractor tailored to cultivating that basically invented the category of <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|These {{structures}} were first required by legislation in Sweden in 1959. Before they were required, some farmers died when their tractors rolled {{on top of}} them. <b>Row-crop</b> <b>tractors,</b> before ROPS, were particularly dangerous because of their 'tricycle' design with the two front wheels spaced close together and angled inward toward the ground. Some farmers were killed by rollovers while operating tractors along [...] slopes. Others have been killed while attempting to tow or pull an excessive load from above axle height, or when cold weather caused the tires to freeze to the ground, in both cases causing the tractor to pivot around the rear axle. ROPS were first required in the United States in 1986, but this requirement did not retroactively apply to tractors produced before this year; therefore, adoption of ROPS has been incomplete in the farming community. To combat this problem, CROPS (cost-effective roll-over protection structures) {{have been developed to}} encourage farmers to retrofit older tractors.|$|R
5000|$|The first tractor of {{the series}} was the 9N, the first tractor to have both three-point hitch and a rear power {{take-off}} (PTO). The 9N was first demonstrated in Dearborn, Michigan on June 29, 1939. Its model name reflected a model-naming system using the last digit of the year of introduction and a letter for product type, with [...] "N" [...] for tractors (hence 9N). Like the Farmall, {{it was designed to}} be a general-purpose <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractor</b> for use on smaller farms. An extremely simple tractor, the 9N was fitted with the Ferguson system three-point hitch, a three-speed transmission, and featured footpegs instead of running boards. The 9N's relatively tall and wide-spaced front wheel design resulted in somewhat sluggish steering and reduced maneuverability compared to competing machines such as John Deere's Models A and B, and the Farmall [...] "Letter series". The 9N had variable front track, a valuable feature for row-crop cultivation, via front half-axles that could be slid in and out and pinned in place. It also had variable rear track via the reversible offset of the rear wheel design (flipping the rear wheels around 180°, moving the formerly inboard side to the outboard side, widened the rear track). Uniquely, the exhaust was routed underneath the tractor, much like an automobile. All 9N tractors were painted dark grey. This tractor has a rear PTO, which could be used to drive three-point or towed implements. The Ferguson hitch was designed to solve some of the problems found in the earlier Fordson tractors, such as flipping over if the plow hit an obstruction. The upper link also would adjust the hydraulic lift to use the drag of the plow to improve traction. This was known as draft control.|$|E
5000|$|To {{the extent}} that {{cultivating}} is done commercially today (such as in truck farming), it is usually powered by <b>tractors,</b> especially <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractors.</b> Industrial cultivators can vary greatly in size and shape, from 10 ft to 80 ft wide. Many are equipped with hydraulic wings that fold up to make road travel easier and safer. Different types are used for preparation of fields before planting, and for the control of weeds between row crops. The cultivator may be an implement trailed after the tractor via a drawbar; mounted on the three-point hitch; or mounted on a frame beneath the tractor. Active cultivator implements are driven by a power take-off shaft. While most cultivator are considered a secondary tillage implement, active cultivators are commonly used for primary tillage in lighter soils instead of plowing. The largest versions available are about 6 m wide, and require a tractor with an excess of [...] (PTO) to drive them.|$|R

2500|$|Development of new Fordson/Ford {{tractors}} in the U.S. remained mostly inactive {{for about}} 10 {{years after the}} end of U.S. production, although Ford did experiment with a number of designs during the 1930s. Most of them never left the drawing board, which was intentional; Henry Ford was interested in continuing R (and continued paying Ford engineers to work on it), although he wasn't going to put any models into production until all conditions (design, market) were right for commercial success. A Fordson row-crop model, essentially a [...] "Fordson version of the Farmall" [...] with tricycle design and high clearance, was prototyped at Dearborn in 1930-1931 but waited until 1936 to be produced, when Ford Ltd of Britain produced it as the Fordson All-Around. (It was not without precedent, for the aftermarket had presaged it, although not with the high clearance; in 1939, Ford filed a patent for raising and lowering the clearance on the fly.) The idea of variable front track for <b>row-crop</b> <b>tractors</b> was also considered at Ford during this era. Achieving it via pivoting cantilevered wheel mounts was one of the options, although Ford never put that method into production (it later reached production in the form of the Avery Ro-Trak in 1938). The thought devoted to the topic paid off later, when the Ford 9N achieved it with another, simpler method. Between 1928 and 1932, Henry Ford's attention became consumed mostly by the development and introduction of his company's first V8 engine, which was introduced by Ford on March 31, 1932 and was an immediate success in Ford cars and trucks. Experimental V8-powered tractor prototypes were built, but no production occurred.|$|R
40|$|Numerous advancements in {{machinery}} {{performance on}} <b>row-crop</b> agricultural <b>tractors</b> {{have been made}} in recent years. Currently, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) only tests predetermined points (E. g., max. power, max. torque) for drawbar and hydraulic power. This method of testing has been used for many years with the tractor at a steady state which is usually not typical of row-crop operations. A data acquisition system (DAQ) was designed that records implement energy consumption (E. g., drawbar loading, PTO power, and hydraulic power). The system used a LabVIEW program and a compact data acquisition system (cDAQ) to record data from instrumentation outputting drawbar, PTO, and hydraulic loads. Data were then collected and verified in accordance with OECD standards at the Nebraska Tractor Test Lab (NTTL), an official OECD testing facility. Requirements of the system were: implementation of the system on multiple machines with minor alterations, minimally invasive to the factory design of the tractor, and equivalent data compared to those recorded by the NTTL testing devices and procedures. Manufacturers’ calibration information along with standardized testing equipment used to tune NTTL testing devices were used to verify that the system would perform according to OECD guidelines. The collection methodology included hydraulic testing at steady state in accordance to OECD Code 2. The hydraulic system was verified with varying curvatures near the sensors that provided data within a 1 percent error of the actual hydraulic power. Another test included calibration of a strain instrumented drawbar within 100 lbf of a dynamic load...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation {{of recent}} {{advances}} in tire technologies such as advanced deflection agricultural tires (Firestone IF and VF) and precision tire inflation technologies on soil compaction, traction, fuel economy and crop yield responses are important. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the effects of field and transport (road) tire inflation pressure settings of <b>row-crop</b> agricultural <b>tractor</b> and planter tires on soil compaction. A randomized complete block design experiment was conducted at the Iowa State University farm at Boone, Iowa for two tire inflation pressure levels on Dual Front (Firestone IF 420 / 85 R 34) and Dual Rear (Firestone IF 480 / 80 R 50) tires on a John Deere 8310 R MFWD tractor, and transport tires (Super single 445 / 50 R 22. 5) on a John Deere DB 60 planter. Soil compaction was measured using Stress State Transducers (SSTs) buried at 15 -cm and 30 -cm depths beneath the untrafficked soil surface. The soil cone index depth profile was measured at tire-centerline, tire-edge and 20 cm laterally outboard of the tire edge before and after tractor-planter tire passes. Peak Octahedral Normal Stress (ONS) and the corresponding Octahedral Shear Stress (OSS) values in soil were calculated from the SST data. The peak ONS and corresponding OSS values from the road tire inflation pressure settings were statistically higher (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 05) than the field tire inflation pressure settings. The maximum ONS was observed at 15 cm soil depth from the road tire inflation pressure setting of the rear tractor tires (179 kPa tire inflation pressure and 33 kN load per tire). The ONS from the front tractor tires (138 kPa tire inflation pressure and 17 kN load per tire) and planter transportation tires (620 kPa tire inflation pressure and 16. 5 kN load per tire) were similar. Cone index data also showed significant differences, comparing before and after tires passes, at the tire-centerline. The peak cone index values for the 0 to 100 mm soil depth range were 1. 3 MPa and 1. 2 MPa from the road and field tire inflation pressure settings, respectively...|$|R
