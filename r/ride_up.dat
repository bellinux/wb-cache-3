5|$|The {{game has}} three playable {{character}}s; Lilac, Carol, and Milla. Melee attacks {{that can be}} used on enemies, and each character has a unique array of moves which allow them to traverse the environment in different ways. Lilac can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an air dash, allowing her to bounce off walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. By picking up gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> vertical walls. Milla can throw gelatinous cubes and put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap her ears to reach high areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{vanguard of}} the Crusader army {{consisted}} of the Knights Templar under Robert de Sablé. They were followed by three units composed of Richard's own subjects, the Angevins and Bretons, then the Poitevins including Guy of Lusignan, titular King of Jerusalem, and lastly the English and Normans who had charge of the great standard mounted on its waggon. The next seven corps were {{made up of the}} French, the Flemmings, the barons of Outremer and small contingents of crusaders from other lands. Forming the rearguard were the Knights Hospitaller led by Garnier de Nablus. The twelve corps were organised into five larger formations, though their precise distribution is unknown. Additionally, a small troop, under the leadership of Henry II of Champagne, was detached to scout towards the hills, and a squadron of picked knights under King Richard and Hugh of Burgundy, the leader of the French contingent, was detailed to <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> and down the column checking on Saladin's movements and ensuring that their own ranks were kept in order.|$|E

Later that day, while at a party to celebrate his wife Mimi Fariña's twenty-first birthday, Fariña saw a guest with a motorcycle, who later gave Fariña a <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> Carmel Valley Road, heading east toward the rural Cachagua area of Carmel Valley.|$|E
25|$|For {{at least}} {{ten years after the}} wreck, the imprint of Jones' engine was clearly visible in the {{embankment}} {{on the east side of}} the tracks about two-tenths of a mile north of Tucker's Creek, which is where the marker was located. The imprint of the headlight, boiler and the spokes of the wheels could be seen and people would <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> on handcars to view the traces of the famous wreck. Corn that was scattered by the wreck grew for years afterward in the surrounding fields.|$|E
25|$|The smaller {{diameter}} of the tube train {{in relation to the}} tunnel allowed the first car to <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> over the hydraulic buffers, with the second coach driving under the first, leading to significant damage at this end. The leading driving car buckled at three points into a V shape and was crushed to less than half its length between the wall and the weight of the train piling up behind it. The third car was damaged at both ends, more significantly at the leading end as it rode over the second car. Forty-two passengers and the driver died and 74 passengers were treated in hospital for their injuries.|$|E

25|$|He {{followed}} the Tour {{with a strong}} victory in the Clásica de San Sebastián, leading out the sprint and holding off Alexandr Kolobnev and Davide Rebellin. Later, at the Vuelta a España, he started strong, winning the second stage and wearing the general classification leader on the third one. He was among {{the leaders in the}} first week. However, he lost around two minutes on a very wet stage to Saunces and any chance of a podium finish. However, he ended up in fourth position overall at the end with some strong performances including an impressive <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> the Angliru, where he was only bettered by Alberto Contador and then a good performance in the mountain time-trial. Before the participation at the UCI Road World Championships at Varese, he was mathematically proclaimed the UCI ProTour winner, being his second win in the four editions of the competition.|$|E
25|$|The 4th Light Horse Brigade was {{to act as}} the {{northern}} flank guard to prevent German and Ottoman forces moving from the east {{to the west bank}} of the Jordan River, while the 3rd Light Horse Brigade with six guns of the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Artillery Battery advanced up the road from Jisr ed Damieh to capture Es Salt. If the 4th Light Horse Brigade were unable to capture the crossing they were to be deployed in such a way as cover and block this important route from Nablus and Beisan to Es Salt. At the same time as the two light horse brigades moved north on the eastern bank of the Jordan River, the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade was to move up the western bank to cover the Umm esh Shert crossing south of Jisr ed Damieh. The 1st Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades, the Australian Mounted Division headquarters and two mountain batteries were to <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> the Umm esh Shert track to Es Salt.|$|E
25|$|The wood {{used for}} the {{planking}} varies depending on where in the ship it is laid and what structural purpose it serves: The inner layer is Scots pine while the 6-inch skin is made of pitch pine, Honduras mahogany or oak. The outer hull is made of English Elm and Greenheart. Oak beams run across the hull forming three decks - the lower deck beams are 11inches (27.9cm) square in cross-section and are placed less than three feet (0.9m) apart along the ship's length. Seven transverse bulkheads, also of wood, provide additional strength and ensured that any flooding caused by ice damage would not flood the entire ship. To prevent damage from ice floes or crushing the two-blade propeller could be hoisted {{out of the way}} and the rudder could be easily detached and stored aboard. Iron-shod bows were severely raked so that when ramming the ice they would <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> over the margin and crush the ice with deadweight. The coal bunkers on each side contained a steel tank, each of which could hold 60 tons of fresh water. On the long ocean trip to and from New Zealand these tanks could hold additional coal but for the Antarctic voyage the extra water capacity was more important. The metal tanks also contributed to the strength of the lower hull around the boiler and engine spaces.|$|E
5|$|Of course, {{the angle}} of the terrain can {{influence}} all of the calculations above. All else remaining equal, the risk of pitching over the front end is reduced when <b>riding</b> <b>up</b> hill and increased when riding down hill. The possibility of performing a wheelie increases when <b>riding</b> <b>up</b> hill, and is a major factor in motorcycle hillclimbing competitions.|$|R

25|$|Sir Launfal {{has gone}} to his room, but his faerie {{mistress}} does not appear and Sir Launfal soon realises why. Tryamour will no longer come {{to him when he}} wishes for her since he has given away her existence. Soon, her gifts have disappeared or changed. Now he is brought to trial. Since the jury of his peers all know that the Queen is more likely to have propositioned Launfal than the other way around, they believe Launfal's version of the encounter. However, for his insult he is given a year and a fortnight to produce the beautiful lady as proof of his boast; Guenevere says she is willing to be blinded if he manages to produce such a woman. As the day of the proof progresses, the Queen presses for him to be executed while others express doubt, particularly when two parties of gorgeous women <b>ride</b> <b>up.</b> Finally Tryamour arrives and exculpates Launfal on both counts. She breathes on Guenevere and blinds her. Gyfre, now visible, brings his horse Blaunchard, and Tryamour, Launfal, and her ladies ride away to the island of Olyroun, which in Marie de France's twelfth-century version of the tale is Avalon. Once a year, on a certain day, Sir Launfal returns and his horse may be heard neighing and a knight may joust with him, although he was never seen again in Arthur's land.|$|E
25|$|In 1561, Kenshin and Shingen {{fought the}} biggest battle they would fight, the fourth battle of Kawanakajima. Kenshin used an ingenious tactic: a special {{formation}} where {{the soldiers in}} the front would switch with their comrades in the rear, {{as those in the}} frontline became tired or wounded. This allowed the tired soldiers to take a break, while the soldiers who had not seen action would fight on the front lines. This was extremely effective and because of this Kenshin nearly defeated Shingen. In Kōyō Gunkan there {{is one of the most}} famous instances of single combat in samurai history; during this battle, Kenshin managed to <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> to Shingen and slashed at him with his sword. Shingen fended off the blows with his iron war fan or tessen. Kenshin failed to finish Shingen off before a Takeda retainer drove him away. Shingen made a counter-attack and the Uesugi army retreated. The result of the fourth battle of Kawanakajima is still uncertain. Many scholars are divided on who the actual victor was, if the battle was actually decisive enough to even declare one, thus is generally considered a draw. It is considered to be the largest casualty battle in the Sengoku period, with loss of estimated 72 percent of Kenshin's army and 62 percent of Shingen's army, but Shingen also lost two of his most important generals during the battle, namely his advisor Yamamoto Kansuke and younger brother Takeda Nobushige. Some more conservative estimates place the casualties around 20 percent.|$|E
500|$|The Roman main charge {{would likely}} have been preceded by harassing attacks by the light cavalry. The mounted archers would execute what the Romans knew as the [...] "Parthian attack": <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> to within range of the enemy, loose a volley of arrows, then hastily retreat, using the arrow {{distance}} to escape pursuit. This could be repeated several times, causing significant casualties and, ideally, enticing the enemy into a premature and disorganised charge. However, in this case, the German cavalry would have been prevented from charging as their interspersed infantry support {{would not have been}} able to keep up—most likely, they awaited the Roman cavalry at the halt, or moved forward slowly.|$|E

500|$|Located {{at the end}} of {{pleasure}} gardens called Beckford's Ride which ran from his house in Lansdown Crescent all the way north to the tower at the top of Lansdown Hill, Beckford used the monument as both a library and a retreat. He also made it his habit to <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> to the tower to view the progress of gardens and works then walk back down to Lansdown Crescent for breakfast. From the top of the tower, with a strong spyglass, Beckford could make out shipping in the Bristol Channel. Beckford wished that he had built the tower forty feet higher and admitted: [...] "such as it is, it is a famous landmark for drunken farmers on their way home from market".|$|E
500|$|With Annie, it is different. The two of {{them have}} fun making a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. He met her playing tennis doubles with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk led her to offer him first a <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> town and then {{a glass of wine}} on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild {{exchange}} of trivial personal data is revealed in [...] "mental subtitles" [...] as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annie's singing audition for a night club ("It Had to be You"). He suggests they kiss first {{to get it out of}} the way. After their lovemaking that night, Alvy is [...] "a wreck", while she relaxes with a joint.|$|E
500|$|Simpson in his {{adolescence}} {{was described}} as fearsome in descent by fellow Scala Wheelers club member George Shaw, who explained that if Simpson dropped behind on a climb, {{he would come back}} on the descent. Simpson's risk-taking on descents was evident throughout his career, crashing in four out of the seven Tours de France he competed in. Track rider Norman Sheil recalled: [...] "When racing on a banked velodrome, Simpson would sometimes <b>ride</b> <b>up</b> the advertising boards {{at the top of the}} bankings, Wall of Death-style, to please the crowds." [...] Simpson's death was attributed to his unwillingness to admit defeat ascending Mont Ventoux. He described a near-death experience during a race in 1964, the Trofeo Baracchi two-man time trial, to Vin Denson, who recalled: [...] "He said he felt peace of mind and wasn't afraid to die. He said he would have been happy dying." ...|$|E
