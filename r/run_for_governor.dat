5|$|In 2002, {{plagued by}} {{political}} missteps and personal scandals, {{the administration of}} Republican Acting Governor of Massachusetts Jane Swift appeared vulnerable, and many Republicans viewed her as unable to win a general election. Prominent party figures– {{as well as the}} White House– wanted Romney to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> and the opportunity appealed to him for reasons including its national visibility. A poll by the Boston Herald showed Republicans favoring Romney over Swift by more than 50percentage points. On March 19, 2002, Swift announced she would not seek her party's nomination, and hours later Romney declared his candidacy, for which he would face no opposition in the primary. In June 2002, the Massachusetts Democratic Party challenged Romney's eligibility to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor,</b> noting that state law required seven years' consecutive residence and that Romney had filed his state tax returns as a Utah resident in 1999 and 2000. In response, the bipartisan Massachusetts State Ballot Law Commission unanimously ruled that he had maintained sufficient financial and personal ties to Massachusetts and was, therefore, an eligible candidate.|$|E
5|$|Morrow's first {{political}} experience {{was working in}} his uncle William O. Bradley's gubernatorial campaign in 1895. In 1899, Republican gubernatorial candidate William S. Taylor offered to make Morrow his Secretary of State in exchange for Bradley's support in the election; Bradley refused. Despite the encouragement of friends, Morrow declined to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> in 1911.|$|E

5|$|Buckner had a keen {{interest}} in politics and friends had been urging him to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate these terms, he instructed a friend to withdraw his name from consideration if it was presented. In 1868, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that nominated Horatio Seymour for president. Though Buckner had favored George H. Pendleton, he loyally supported the party's nominee throughout the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Daley {{took control}} of the Chicago Public School system in 1995 and {{appointed}} Paul Vallas. When Vallas left the post to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor,</b> Daley chose the relatively obscure Arne Duncan, who later became the U.S. Secretary of Education under Barack Obama, to lead the district. On March 19, 1997, the Chicago City Council adopted the Domestic Partners Ordinance, which made employee benefits available to same-sex partners of City employees. Daley said it was an issue of fairness.|$|E
5|$|Daniels' {{decision}} to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Governor</b> of Indiana led {{to most of}} the rest of Republican field of candidates to drop out of the race. The only challenger who did not do so was conservative activist and lobbyist Eric Miller. Miller worked for the Phoenix Group, a Christian rights defense group. Daniels' campaign platform centered on cutting the state budget and privatizing public agencies. He won the primary with 67% of the vote.|$|E
50|$|In {{his bid for}} {{re-election}} in 1978, Thomson lost to Democrat Hugh Gallen. Thomson considered running for the presidency in 1980, but instead <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor,</b> again losing to Gallen.

5|$|Ford seriously {{considered}} leaving the Senate and {{running for governor}} again in 1983 and 1991, but decided against it both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in the Senate and desire to become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Greenup {{resigned}} his circuit judgeship on June 5, 1804, to {{make another}} <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor.</b> Immensely popular, he ran unopposed, and served as governor from September 4, 1804 to September 1, 1808. During Greenup's administration, the state chartered the Bank of Kentucky and the Ohio Canal Company; Greenup became {{a director of the}} former in 1807. Despite his popularity, however, he was unable to pass much of his proposed agenda, which included provision of public education and reforms to the militia, courts, revenue system, and penal system.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, Knott left Congress {{and made}} a {{successful}} <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor.</b> He secured major reforms in education, but was stymied in his pursuit of tax reform. After his term as governor, he was a delegate to the state's constitutional convention in 1891. In 1892, he became a professor at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky and helped organized the college's law school in 1894.

5|$|In March 2003, Huntsman {{resigned}} {{his post}} in the Bush administration. In mid-August, three-term incumbent Governor Mike Leavitt, whom Huntsman strongly supported, {{decided not to run}} for re-election in order to become the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Bush administration. Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Governor</b> of Utah. In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66–34%. In November 2004, Huntsman was elected governor with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr. In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, The Boston Globe first {{reported}} that Wolf was considering {{not running for}} re-election. Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed that he would remain in office, but would not seek re-election in 2016. Wolf's political aspirations were prodded shortly after handily winning re-election in 2014, though {{he said he was}} more focused on serving his constituents than considering future office. After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 in order to focus on a <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> in 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company.|$|E
5|$|Madison's {{political}} experience before becoming governor {{consisted of a}} twenty-year tenure as state auditor. Although his military service made him extremely popular in Kentucky, he sought no higher office until the citizens insisted he <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> in 1816. James Johnson, his only challenger in the race, dropped out early due to Madison's overwhelming popularity, and Madison was elected without opposition. A few weeks later, {{he became the first}} Kentucky governor to die in office. Opponents of his lieutenant governor, Gabriel Slaughter, mounted a popular but unsuccessful challenge to Slaughter's succeeding Madison in office.|$|E

5|$|Orozco, who {{saw himself}} as being {{instrumental}} in Madero's victory over Díaz, was merely appointed as a commander of the rurales in Chihuahua, which increased his resentment. When he tried to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> of the state, Madero supported his opponent, Abraham González and eventually pressured Orozco {{to drop out of}} the race. When, in the aftermath of the Plan of Ayala, Madero ordered Orozco to lead federal troops to suppress Zapata, Orozco refused. In March 1912, Orozco issued his Plan of Empacadora and formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero.|$|E

He works with Turner Network Television (TNT) alongside of Shaquille O'Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson as a studio pundit for its coverage of NBA games and is a spokesman for CDW. In addition, Barkley has written several books and has shown an interest in politics; in October 2008, {{he announced that he}} would <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Governor</b> of Alabama in 2014, but he changed his mind in 2010.|$|E
5|$|After {{service in}} World War I and {{a law degree}} from Yale, Dilworth practiced law in Philadelphia. He and Clark were allies in the anti-corruption reform effort that had swept the city four years earlier. Dilworth had run for mayor unsuccessfully in 1947, with Clark as his {{campaign}} manager. In 1949, he was elected City Treasurer. He resigned that post to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> in 1950, but was defeated by Republican John S. Fine. Democratic party leaders had intended Dilworth to be their candidate for mayor again in 1951, but when Clark announced his candidacy, Dilworth agreed to run for district attorney instead. He won, taking just shy of 58% of the vote. In the primary election in May, Dilworth easily defeated his underfunded opponent, William A. Paschall, a local meat dealer.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of the {{nomination}} speech, Howe and Roosevelt planned that the latter would <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Governor</b> of New York in 1932 and President in 1936. However, Governor Smith was named the Democratic presidential candidate in 1928, and persuaded the state convention to draft Roosevelt. Howe predicted disaster, feeling that a Republican challenger was sure to beat Roosevelt in what was expected to be nationally a Republican year. Though Howe remained Roosevelt's unofficial campaign manager, he was technically subordinate to a state campaign manager selected by Smith, as well as Smith's personal campaign manager, Belle Moskowitz, with whom Howe frequently clashed. In the fall election, Roosevelt won the governorship by a small margin, though Smith was defeated by Herbert Hoover both nationally and in New York State.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his gubernatorial term, Isaac Shelby {{retired from}} public life but he was called back into {{politics}} by the impending War of 1812. Kentuckians urged Shelby to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> again and lead them through the anticipated conflict. He was elected easily, and at the request of General William Henry Harrison, commanded troops from Kentucky at the Battle of the Thames. After the war, he declined President James Monroe's offer to become Secretary of War. In his last act of public service, Shelby and Andrew Jackson acted as commissioners to negotiate the Jackson Purchase from the Chickasaw Indian tribe. Isaac Shelby died, at his estate in Lincoln County, Kentucky, on July 18, 1826.|$|E
