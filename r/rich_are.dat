25|$|The mines {{that made}} Guanajuato <b>rich</b> <b>are</b> inside and {{just outside the}} city proper. A number of these mines gave rise to small {{communities}} with their own churches; these still exist with other institutions such as museums. The best known mines gave their names {{to a number of}} the city’s oldest neighborhoods such as Cata, Rayas y Mellado, La Pastita, San Luisito and Valenciana. Some of these mines {{are open to the public}} for tours. The first significant mine was called San Barnabe, which brought thousands of adventurers to Guanajuato and led to the discovery of other mineral deposits. This mine functioned from the 16th century until 1928. The remains of this mine can still be found in the small village of La Luz just outside the city.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers have {{commented on}} {{themes of the}} episode; topics of {{discussion}} included the relationship between parents and children, class relations, the scene in which Logan attacks the perpetrator in Veronica's sex tape case, and the final scene {{in relation to the}} overall moral of the series. According to Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club, the episode contained a role reversal between Veronica and Keith, with Keith violating the law. He noted the scene in which Keith erases the surveillance tapes of Veronica as illustrating the theme that [...] "the two aren't so different after all." [...] Roger Holland of PopMatters thought that the episode demonstrated that Veronica and Keith's relationship was the central component of the show: [...] "it was all about Veronica and Keith. And beyond that, about parents, children, and the myriad ways they can fuck each other up." [...] Stephanie Zacharek, writing for Salon, thought that the final scenes of [...] "The Bitch Is Back" [...] "cement the dour reality, posited {{at the very beginning of}} the series, that the <b>rich</b> ... <b>are</b> always going to be the ones in charge." ...|$|E

Having begun with a scathing criticism of the corrupting effects of money and misguided servile attitudes towards the wealthy, Clement discusses the implications of [...] The <b>rich</b> <b>are</b> either unconvinced {{by the promise of}} eternal life, or unaware of the conflict between the possession of material and spiritual wealth, and the good Christian has a duty to guide them towards a better life through the Gospel. Jesus' words are not to be taken literally — we should seek the supercelestial [...] meaning in which the true route to salvation is revealed. The holding of material wealth in itself is not a wrong, {{as long as it is}} used charitably, but men should be careful not to let their wealth dominate their spirit. It is more important to give up sinful passions than external wealth. If the rich man is to be saved, all he must do is to follow the two commandments, and while material wealth is of no value to God, it can be used to alleviate the suffering of our neighbor.|$|E
500|$|In general, {{the world}} of these early volumes is a [...] " [...] and ... divided place." [...] In these early titles, the boys are cynical about human nature, an {{attitude}} apparently justified when the police, whom they have repeatedly helped, throw them into jail on slim evidence in The Great Airport Mystery (1930). The police and authority figures in general come off poorly in these books, {{so much so that}} at one point Edward Stratemeyer wrote McFarlane to reprimand him for [...] "grievous lack of respect for officers of the law." [...] The Hardys are less affluent than earlier Stratemeyer characters; they eagerly accept cash rewards largely to finance college educations, and, with their parents, strive to please their Aunt Gertrude, because she possesses a small fortune. The <b>rich</b> <b>are</b> portrayed as greedy and selfish. This view of the world reflects McFarlane's relative [...] "lack [...] sympathy with the American power structure." [...] In his autobiography, McFarlane described his rationale for writing the books this way, writing: [...] "I had my own thoughts about teaching youngsters that obedience to authority is somehow sacred.... Would civilization crumble if kids got the notion that the people who ran the world were sometimes stupid, occasionally wrong and even corrupt at times?" ...|$|E

After {{the chaos of the}} 90s, {{highlighted}} by Yeltsin's attack on the Russian parliament with tanks in 1993 and the collapse of almost every bank in 1998, Putin has delivered political calm and a 7% annual rate of growth. Inequalities have increased and many of the new <b>rich</b> <b>are</b> grotesquely crass and cruel, but not all the Kremlin's vast revenues from oil and gas have gone into private pockets or are being hoarded in the government's [...] "stabilisation fund". Enough has gone into modernising schools and hospitals so that people notice a difference. Overall living standards are up.

It is not merely that the slaves are thieves and runaways, wine-bibbers and gluttons - the <b>rich</b> <b>are</b> worse (iv. 3). It is their harshness and greed that drive the poor to join the Bagaudae and fly for shelter to the barbarian invaders (v. 5 and 6). Everywhere the taxes are heaped upon the needy, while the rich, who have the apportioning of the impost, escape comparatively free (v. 7). The great towns are wholly given up to the abominations of the circus and the theatre, where decency is wholly set at nought, and Minerva, Mars, Neptune and the old gods are still worshipped (vi. 11; cf- vi. 2 and viii. 2).|$|E

2500|$|In May 2017, {{new data}} sets from the economists Piketty, Saez, and Gabriel Zucman of University of California, Berkeley {{demonstrate}} that inequality runs {{much deeper than}} previous data indicated. The share of incomes {{for those in the}} bottom half of the U.S. population stagnated and declined during the years 1980 to 2014 from 20% in 1980 to 12% in 2014. By contrast, the top 1% share of income grew from 12% in 1980 to 20% in 2014. The top 1% now makes on average 81 times more than the bottom 50% of adults, where as in 1981 they made 27 times more. Pretax incomes for the top 0.001% surged 636% during the years 1980 to 2014. The economists also note that the growth of inequality during the 1970s to the 1990s can be attributed to wage growth among top earners, but the ever-widening gap has been [...] "a capital-driven phenomenon since the late 1990s." [...] They posit that [...] "the working <b>rich</b> <b>are</b> either turning into or being replaced by rentiers." ...|$|E
