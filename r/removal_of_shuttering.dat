50|$|Damage {{can occur}} during the casting and de-shuttering processes. For instance, {{the corners of}} beams can be damaged during the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>shuttering</b> because they are less {{effectively}} compacted by means of vibration (improved by using form-vibrators). Other physical damage {{can be caused by}} the use of steel shuttering without base plates. The steel shuttering pinches the top surface of a concrete slab due to the weight of the next slab being constructed.|$|E
5000|$|A matter-wave beam {{stopped by}} an {{absorbing}} shutter exhibits an oscillatory density profile during its propagation after <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shutter.</b> Whenever this propagation is accurately {{described by the}} time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation, the transient wave functions resemble the solutions that appear for the intensity of light subject to Fresnel diffraction by a straight edge. For this reason, the transient phenomenon was dubbed diffraction in time and has since then been recognised as ubiquitous in quantum dynamics.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house is}} a square two-story structure, {{measuring}} approximately 50 ft on each side, and topped with a hip roof; its brick walls rest on a stone foundation with a basement. [...] At the time of construction, the house included multiple chimneys, but with one exception these have all been removed. Other changes {{since the time of}} construction have included the replacement of multiple doors and the addition of a wing in the rear and a small stone porch on the southern side. With the exception <b>of</b> the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>shutters</b> from the windows, the Main Street front of the house differs little from its state when built. Inside, many original features remain, including walnut panelling and two cherry fireplaces. The most prominent original feature is the spiral staircase, which climbs from the first floor to a skylight above the second floor. Lawrence's original dining room and kitchen were damaged by a fire; soon after new owners purchased the house in 1947, the rooms were completely reworked and converted into a storage room for the rear wing.|$|R
2500|$|The {{religious}} {{census of}} Sussex in 1851 recorded that the [...] "Rehoboth Calvinistic Baptist Chapel" [...] had 500 sittings, {{all of which}} were free; and attendances at morning and afternoon services were given as 235 and 300 respectively. [...] Attendances declined in the 20th century, and in 1986 conversion to a house was suggested. [...] This happened soon afterwards, and the building is still in residential use. [...] Some changes have been made, such as the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> original <b>shutters</b> on the south-facing windows. [...] The chapel's registration for the solemnisation of marriages was formally cancelled by the General Register Office in March 1980.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{algorithm}} for efficient <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> rolling <b>shutter</b> distortions in uncalibrated streaming videos. Our proposed method is calibration free {{as it does}} not need any knowledge of the camera used, nor does it require calibration using specially recorded calibration sequences. Our algorithm can perform rolling shutter removal under varying focal lengths, as in videos from CMOS cameras equipped with an optical zoom. We evaluate our approach across {{a broad range of}} cameras and video sequences demonstrating robustness, scaleability, and repeatability. We also conducted a user study, which demonstrates preference for the output of our algorithm over other state-of-the art methods. Our algorithm is computationally efficient, easy to parallelize, and robust to challenging artifacts introduced by various cameras with differing technologies. 1. ...|$|R

Other 18th-century changes include the lengthening of the spits in the kitchen chimney so that they could be turned on the outside wall, the making of two new closets in the Jury Chamber under the Music Loft and the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the outside <b>shutters</b> and their being placed inside.|$|R
