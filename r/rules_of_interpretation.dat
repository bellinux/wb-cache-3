25|$|The {{formative}} {{period of}} Islamic jurisprudence stretches {{back to the}} time of the early Muslim communities. In this period, jurists were more concerned with pragmatic issues of authority and teaching than with theory. Progress in theory began to develop with the coming of the early Muslim jurist Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i (767–820), who codified the basic principles of Islamic jurisprudence in his book ar-Risālah. The book details the four roots of law (Qur'an, Sunnah, ijma, and qiyas) while specifying that the primary Islamic texts (the Qur'an and the hadith) must be understood according to objective <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> derived from scientific study of the Arabic language.|$|E

2500|$|Conservative Jewish thinkers {{take the}} {{position}} that halakha can and should evolve to meet the changing reality of Jewish life. Conservative Judaism, therefore, views that traditional Jewish legal codes must be viewed {{through the lens of}} academic criticism. [...] As Solomon Schechter noted, [...] "however great the literary value of a code may be, it does not invest it with infallibility, nor does it exempt it from the student or the rabbi who makes use of it from the duty of examining each paragraph on its own merits, and subjecting it to the same <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> that were always applied to Tradition".|$|E
2500|$|The {{in-depth}} study of Mishneh Torah underwent a revival in Lithuanian Judaism {{in the late}} 19th century. The Lithuanians did not {{use it as a}} source book on practical halakha, as they followed the Ashkenazi authorities such as Moses Isserles and the Aruch ha-Shulchan. [...] Instead they used it as a guide to Talmudic interpretation and methodology. [...] Given the fact that the Mishneh Torah entirely omits these topics, this reading seems paradoxical and against the grain. [...] Their method was to compare the Talmudic source material with Maimonides' final decision, in order to reconstruct the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> that must have been used to get from one to the other.|$|E

50|$|The golden <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation,</b> {{together}} with the principles reflected in Delmas, has in recent years endured much criticism.

60|$|In {{order that}} the same <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> should be {{considered}} applicable to the Constitution of the Society and {{to that of the}} United States, we must attribute to the former a solemnity and importance which involve a palpable absurdity. To claim for it the verbal accuracy and the legal wariness of a mere contract is equally at war with common sense and the facts of the case; and even were it not so, the party to a bond who should attempt to escape its ethical obligation by a legal quibble of construction would be put in coventry by all honest men. In point of fact, the Constitution was simply the minutes of an agreement among certain gentlemen, to define the limits within which they would accept trust funds, and the objects for which they should expend them.|$|E
6000|$|The {{immediate}} effect of such judgment {{will be the}} decision of the question whether the men of the nineteenth century are to adopt the demonology of the men of the first century as divinely revealed truth, or to reject it as degrading falsity. The reverend Principal of King's College has delivered his judgment in perfectly clear and candid terms. Two years since, Dr. Wace said that he believed the story as it stands; and consequently he holds, as a part of divine revelation, that the spiritual world comprises devils, who, under certain circumstances, may enter men and be transferred from them to four-footed beasts. For the distinguished Anglican divine and Biblical scholar that {{is part and parcel of}} the teachings respecting the spiritual world which we owe to the founder of Christianity. It is an inseparable part of that Christian orthodoxy which, if a man rejects, he is to be considered and called an [...] "infidel." [...] According to the ordinary <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> of language, Mr. Gladstone must hold the same view.|$|E
60|$|And meanwhile--as {{was to be}} {{expected}} from a generation which abhors torture, labours for the reformation of criminals, and even doubts whether it should not abolish capital punishment--a shaking of the heavens is abroad, of which we shall hear more and more, as the years roll on--a general inclination to ask whether Holy Scripture really endorses the Middle-age notions of future punishment in endless torment? Men are writing and speaking on this matter, not merely with ability and learning, but with a piety, and reverence for Scripture which (rightly or wrongly employed) must, and will, command attention. They are saying that it is not those who deny these notions who disregard the letter of Scripture, but those who assert them; that they are distorting the plain literal text, in order to make Scripture fit the writings of Dante and Milton, when they translate into 'endless torments after death,' such phrases as the outer darkness, the undying worm, the Gehenna of fire--which manifestly (say these men), if judged by fair <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation,</b> refer to this life, and specially to the fate of the Jewish nation: or when they tell us that eternal death means really eternal life, only in torments. We demand, they say, not a looser, but a stricter; not a more metaphoric, but a more literal; not a more careless, but a more reverent interpretation of Scripture; and whether this demand be right or wrong, it will not pass unheard.|$|E
