Based on five-years experiences with LC-Finingtechnology in Slovnaft refinery Bratislava the authors described existing technical and operational measures,which had been realised in the past. In the prepared steps of activities, they proposed to utilise also solventdeasphalting technology for decreasing of coking in the equipment of <b>residual</b> <b>hydrocracking</b> units.

30|$|The {{upgrading}} {{of heavy}} crude oil residues to more valuable light and middle distillates is becoming increasingly important for the global refining industry because {{of the decline in}} conventional, light crude oil sources [1]. The hydrogenolysis is defined as the transformation of large hydrocarbon molecules (high boiling point) into smaller molecules (low boiling point) in the presence of hydrogen. In residue hydrotreatment, this transformation occurs due to the breaking of carbon–carbon bonds or the removal of large atoms that is bonded to two unconnected pieces of hydrocarbon and has been used as one of the techniques for the upgrading of crude residues. For most of hydrotreating catalysts, the conversion rate is primarily a function of operating temperature, pressure and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) [2]. It is generally used to process heavy oil cuts. The process is tailored to various needs of refineries to maximize middle distillates, gasoline, LPG and similar products [3]. Kinetic model has a significant effect on process optimization, unit design and catalyst selection. Mathematical models for a trickle bed catalytic reactor can be complex due to many microscopic and macroscopic effects occurring inside the reactor, including flow patterns of both phases, size and shape of a catalyst particle, wetting of the catalyst pores with liquid phase, pressure drop, intraparticle gradients, thermal effects and, of course, kinetics on the catalyst surface [4]. Laxminarasimhan et al. [5] described a five-parameter continuous model for hydrocracking of heavy petroleum feedstocks that was subsequently used by Khorasheh et al. [6, 7] and Ashouri et al. [8] to describe the kinetics of hydrocracking, HDS, and HDN processes of bitumen. Today, {{there are two types of}} kinetic models available, detailed molecular models and lumped empirical models. The detailed molecular model is very accurate because it takes into account all possible reactions and mechanisms. Although the predictive power of detailed molecular models is much better than that of lumped empirical models, but their application to heavy feedstocks is very rare due to the complexity of the mixture. However, the available analytical techniques are incapable to identify the detailed molecular level of heavy feedstocks [9]. There are other types of modeling used to determine reactor performance such as hybrid modeling which is a first-principles model (FPM) based on the pseudo-component approach coupled with neural network(s) in different hybrid architectures [10], Combination of Genetic Algorithm and Sequential Quadratic Programming which based on genetic algorithm and sequential quadratic programming to determine the significant reactions and their corresponding rate constants [11], and some used kinetics to extract information about yield [12] and other model of hydrocracking reactor [13]. The lumped kinetic models are commonly used in modeling the hydrocracking of heavy feedstocks such as atmospheric vacuum resides. The lumped kinetic models have been classified into two types: discrete lumped models and continues lumped models. Specifying the chemical reactions involved in <b>residual</b> <b>hydrocracking</b> and the actual composition of the products is a complicated task. Therefore, the liquid product of residual upgrading is normally divided into several product lumps that are based on true boiling point temperature [14]. This is one approach to simplify the problem which considers the partition of the components into a few equivalent classes called lumps or lumping technique, and then assume each class as an independent entity [15]. The accuracy and the predictive power of discrete lumping models mainly depend on the number of lumps. As the amount of lumps increases, the predicted accuracy improves. Increasing the number of lumps, however, will complicate the model by increasing the number of model parameters [16]. Although numerous researchers published about lumping model for some oils and residues [3, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], there is a lack of models for predicting kinetic parameters of atmospheric crude oil residue with a flexibility of operating pressure along with the absence of experimental data. The proposed model will estimate the optimal conditions of the five lumps, naphtha, kerosene, light gasoil, heavy gasoil and lowest residue with low content of impurities.|$|E
