We estimate that only about 10 % of nearby early-type galaxies contain cores. Furthermore, we show that there is a genuine population of fast <b>rotators</b> with cores.

40|$|Two-dimensional stellar {{kinematics}} of 48 representative elliptical (E) and lenticular (S 0) galaxies {{obtained with}} the SAURON integral-field spectrograph reveal that early-type galaxies appear in two broad flavours, {{depending on whether}} they exhibit clear large-scale rotation or not. We define a new parameter lambda(R) equivalent to /, which involves luminosity-weighted averages over the full two-dimensional kinematic field as a proxy to quantify the observed projected stellar angular momentum per unit mass. We {{use it as a}} basis for a new kinematic classification: early-type galaxies are separated into slow and fast <b>rotators,</b> depending on whether they have lambda(R) values within their effective radius R(e) below or above 0. 1, respectively. Slow and fast <b>rotators</b> are shown to be physically distinct classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be the consequence of a biased viewing angle. Fast <b>rotators</b> tend to be relatively low-luminosity galaxies with M(B) greater than or similar to- 20. 5. Slow <b>rotators</b> tend to be brighter and more massive galaxies, but are still spread over a wide range of absolute magnitude. Three slow <b>rotators</b> of our sample, among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero rotation. Remarkably, all other slow <b>rotators</b> (besides the atypical case of NGC 4550) contain a large kpc-scale kinematically decoupled core (KDC). All fast <b>rotators</b> (except one galaxy with well-known irregular shells) show well-aligned photometric and kinemetric axes, and small velocity twists, in contrast with most slow <b>rotators</b> which exhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists. These results are supported by a supplement of 18 additional early-type galaxies observed with SAURON. In a companion paper (Paper X), we also show that fast and slow <b>rotators</b> are distinct classes in terms of their orbital distribution. We suggest that gas is a key ingredient in the formation and evolution of fast <b>rotators,</b> and that the slowest <b>rotators</b> are the extreme evolutionary end point reached deep in gravitational potential wells where dissipationless mergers had {{a major role in the}} evolution, and for which most of the baryonic angular momentum was expelled outwards. Detailed numerical simulations in a cosmological context are required to understand how to form large-scale KDCs within slow <b>rotators,</b> and more generally to explain the distribution of lambda(R) values within early-type galaxies and the distinction between fast and slow <b>rotators...</b>|$|R

40|$|For early-type galaxies, {{the ability}} to sustain a corona of hot, X-ray {{emitting}} gas could have {{played a key role}} in quenching their star-formation history. Yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gas around these galaxies. By combining photometric and spectroscopic measurements for the early-type galaxies observed during the Atlas 3 D integral-field survey with measurements of their X-ray luminosity based on X-ray data of both low and high spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. Specifically, whereas slow <b>rotators</b> generally have X-ray halos with luminosity L_X,gas and temperature T values that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission is sustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by the stellar-mass loss material, fast <b>rotators</b> tend to display L_X,gas values that fall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar T values that do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case of slow <b>rotators.</b> Considering that fast <b>rotators</b> are likely to be intrinsically flatter than slow <b>rotators,</b> and that the few L_X,gas-deficient slow <b>rotators</b> also happen to be relatively flat, the observed L_X,gas deficiency in these objects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a harder time in retaining their hot gas. We discuss the implications that a different hot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-produced gaseous material, considering in particular how the L_X,gas deficiency of fast <b>rotators</b> would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss material into new stars than slow <b>rotators.</b> This is consistent with the finding that molecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast <b>rotators</b> in the Atlas 3 D sample, and that fast <b>rotators</b> tend to dustier than slow <b>rotators.</b> [Abridged]Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publications on MNRAS.

40|$|We {{analysed}} two-dimensional maps of 48 early-type galaxies {{obtained with}} the SAURON and OASIS integral-field spectrographs using kinemetry, a generalization of surface photometry {{to the higher}} order moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD). The maps analysed include: reconstructed image, mean velocity, velocity dispersion, h 3 and h 4 Gauss-Hermite moments. Kinemetry is a good method to recognize structures otherwise missed by using surface photometry, such as embedded discs and kinematic subcomponents. In the SAURON sample, we find that 31 per cent of early-type galaxies are single component systems. 91 per cent of the multicomponents systems have two kinematic subcomponents, the rest having three. In addition, 29 per cent of galaxies have kinematically decoupled components, nuclear components with significant kinematic twists. We differentiate between slow and fast <b>rotators</b> using velocity maps only and find that fast-rotating galaxies contain discs with a large range in mass fractions to the main body. Specifically, {{we find that the}} velocity maps of fast <b>rotators</b> closely resemble those of inclined discs, except in the transition regions between kinematic subcomponents. This deviation is measured with the kinemetric k 5 /k 1 ratio, which is large and noisy in slow <b>rotators</b> and about 2 per cent in fast <b>rotators.</b> In terms of E/S 0 classification, this means that 74 per cent of Es and 92 per cent of S 0 s have components with disc-like kinematics. We suggest that differences in k 5 /k 1 values for the fast and slow <b>rotators</b> arise from their different intrinsic structure which is reflected on the velocity maps. For the majority of fast <b>rotators,</b> the kinematic axial ratios are equal to or less than their photometric axial ratios, contrary to what is predicted with isotropic Jeans models viewed at different inclinations. The position angles of fast <b>rotators</b> are constant, while they vary abruptly in slow <b>rotators.</b> Velocity dispersion maps of face-on galaxies have shapes similar to the distribution of light. Velocity dispersion maps of the edge-on fast <b>rotators</b> and all slow <b>rotators</b> show differences which can only be partially explained with isotropic models and, in the case of fast <b>rotators,</b> often require additional cold components. We constructed local (bin-by-bin) h 3 -V/σ and h 4 -V/σ diagrams from SAURON observations. We confirm the classical anticorrelation of h 3 and V/σ, but we also find that h 3 is almost zero in some objects or even weakly correlated with V/σ. The distribution of h 4 for fast and slow <b>rotators</b> is mildly positive on average. In general, fast <b>rotators</b> contain flattened components characterized by a disc-like rotation.

However, there are systematic deviations between modeled and observed temperatures in Saturn's shadow depending on solar phase angle, and these deviations indicate that the apparent thermal inertia increases with solar phase angle. This dependence {{is likely to be}} explained if large slowly spinning particles have lower thermal inertia values than those for small fast spinning particles because the thermal emission of slow <b>rotators</b> is relatively stronger than that of fast <b>rotators</b> at low phase and vise versa. Additional parameter fits, which assume that slow and fast <b>rotators</b> have different thermal inertia values, show the derived thermal inertia values of slow (fast) <b>rotators</b> to be 8 (77), 8 (27), 9 (34), 5 (55) Jm^- 2 K^- 1 s^- 1 / 2 for the A, B, and C rings, and the Cassini division, respectively. The values for fast <b>rotators</b> are still much smaller than those for solid ice with no porosity.

By combining homogeneously derived photometric and spectroscopic measurements for the early-type galaxies observed as part of the ATLAS 3 D integral field survey with measurements of their X-ray luminosity based on X-ray data of both low and high spatial resolution (for 47 and 19 objects, respectively) we conclude that the hot gas content of early-type galaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. Specifically, whereas slow <b>rotators</b> generally have X-ray haloes with luminosity LX, gas and temperature T values that are well in line with what is expected if the hot gas emission is sustained by the thermalization of the kinetic energy carried by the stellar mass loss material, fast <b>rotators</b> tend to display LX, gas values that fall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar T values that do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy (traced by the stellar velocity dispersion) as observed in the case of slow <b>rotators.</b> Such a discrepancy between the hot gas content of slow and fast <b>rotators</b> would appear to reduce, or even disappear, for large values of the dynamical mass (above ˜ 3 × 1011 M⊙), with younger fast <b>rotators</b> displaying also somewhat larger LX, gas values possibly owing to the additional energy input from recent supernovae explosions. Considering that fast <b>rotators</b> are likely to be intrinsically flatter than slow <b>rotators,</b> and that the few LX, gas-deficient slow <b>rotators</b> also happen to be relatively flat, the observed LX, gas deficiency in these objects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a harder time in retaining their hot gas, although we suggest that the degree of rotational support could further hamper the efficiency with which the kinetic energy of the stellar mass loss material is thermalized in the hot gas. We discuss the implications that a different hot gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally produced gaseous material, considering in particular how the LX, gas deficiency of fast <b>rotators</b> would make them more capable to recycle the stellar mass loss material into new stars than slow <b>rotators.</b> This would be consistent with the finding that molecular gas and young stellar populations are detected only in fast <b>rotators</b> across the entire ATLAS 3 D sample, and that fast <b>rotators</b> tend to have a larger specific dust mass content than slow <b>rotators...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{keep the}} spin tune in the spin depolarizing {{resonance}} free region {{is required for}} accelerating polarized protons to high energy. In RHIC, two snakes are located at {{the opposite side of}} each accelerator. They are configured to yield a spin tune of 1 / 2. Two pairs of spin <b>rotators</b> are located at either side of two detectors in each ring in RHIC to provide longitudinal polarization for the experiments. Since the spin rotation from vertical to longitudinal is localized between the two <b>rotators,</b> the spin <b>rotators</b> do not change the spin tune. However, due to the imperfection of the orbits around the snakes and <b>rotators,</b> the spin tune can be shifted. This note presents the impact of the horizontal orbital angle between the two snakes on the spin tune, as well as the effect of the vertical orbital angle between two <b>rotators</b> at either side of the collision point on the spin tune...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} stellar {{kinematics}} of 39 dwarf early-type galaxies (dEs) in the Virgo Cluster. Based {{on the specific}} stellar angular momentum &# 0955;Re and the ellipticity, we find 11 slow <b>rotators</b> and 28 fast <b>rotators.</b> The fast <b>rotators</b> in the outer parts of the Virgo Cluster rotate significantly faster than fast <b>rotators</b> in the inner parts of the cluster. Moreover, 10 out of the 11 slow <b>rotators</b> {{are located in the}} inner 3 &# 0176; (D < 1 Mpc) of the cluster. The fast <b>rotators</b> contain subtle disk-like structures that are visible in high-pass filtered optical images, while the slow <b>rotators</b> do not exhibit these structures. In addition, two of the dEs have kinematically decoupled cores and four more have emission partially filling in the Balmer absorption lines. These properties suggest that Virgo Cluster dEs may have originated from late-type star-forming galaxies that were transformed by the environment after their infall into the cluster. The correlation between &# 0955;Re and the clustercentric distance can be explained by a scenario where low luminosity star-forming galaxies fall into the cluster, their gas is rapidly removed by ram-pressure stripping, although some of it can be retained in their core, their star formation is quenched but their stellar kinematics are preserved. After {{a long time in the}} cluster and several passes through its center, the galaxies are heated up and transformed into slow rotating dEs...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} census of the {{apparent}} stellar angular momentum within one effective radius of a volume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the nearby Universe, using the integral-field spectroscopy obtained {{in the course of}} the ATLAS 3 D project. We exploit the λR parameter (previously used via a constant threshold value of 0. 1) to characterize the existence of two families of ETGs: slow <b>rotators</b> which exhibit complex stellar velocity fields and often include stellar kinematically distinct cores, and fast <b>rotators</b> which have regular velocity fields. Our complete sample of 260 ETGs leads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow <b>rotators</b> which now includes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity ɛ. It separates the two classes significantly better than the previous prescription and better than a criterion based on V/σ: slow <b>rotators</b> and fast <b>rotators</b> have λR lower and larger than ?, respectively, where kFS= 0. 31 for measurements made within an effective radius Re. We show that the vast majority of ETGs are fast rotators: these have the regular stellar rotation, with aligned photometric and kinematic axes (Paper II of this series), include discs and often bars and represent 86 ± 2 per cent (224 / 260) of all ETGs in the volume-limited ATLAS 3 D sample. Fast <b>rotators</b> span the full range of apparent ellipticities from ɛ= 0 to 0. 85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsic ellipticities from about 0. 35 to 0. 85, the most flattened having morphologies consistent with spiral galaxies. Only a small fraction of ETGs are slow <b>rotators</b> representing 14 ± 2 per cent (36 / 260) of the ATLAS 3 D sample of ETGs. Of all slow <b>rotators,</b> 11 per cent (4 / 36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like components and are rather low-mass objects (Mdyn 1010. 5 M⊙), and often (17 / 32) exhibit kinematically distinct cores. Slow <b>rotators</b> dominate the high-mass end of ETGs in the ATLAS 3 D sample, with only about one-fourth of galaxies with masses above 1011. 5 M⊙ being fast <b>rotators.</b> We show that the a 4 parameter which quantifies the isophote's disciness or boxiness does not seem to be simply related to the observed kinematics, while our new criterion based on λR and ɛ is nearly independent of the viewing angles. We further demonstrate that the classification of ETGs into ellipticals and lenticulars is misleading. Slow and fast <b>rotators</b> tend to be classified as ellipticals and lenticulars, respectively, but the contamination is strong enough to affect results solely based on such a scheme: 20 per cent of all fast <b>rotators</b> are classified as ellipticals, and more importantly 66 per cent of all ellipticals in the ATLAS 3 D sample are fast <b>rotators.</b> Fast and slow <b>rotators</b> illustrate the variety of complex processes shaping galactic systems, such as secular evolution, disc instabilities, interaction and merging, gas accretion, stripping and harassment, forming a sequence from high to low (stellar) baryonic angular momentum. Massive slow <b>rotators</b> represent the extreme instances within the red sequence of galaxies which might have suffered from significant merging without being able to rebuild a fast-rotating component within one effective radius. We therefore argue for a shift in the paradigm for ETGs, where the vast majority of ETGs are galaxies consistent with nearly oblate systems (with or without bars) and where only a small fraction of them (less than 12 per cent) have central (mildly) triaxial structures...|$|R
