60|$|It {{was with}} such {{feelings}} that I eyed {{the approach of}} the new coach, lately established on our road, and known by the name of the Somerset, which, to say truth, possesses some interest for me, even when it conveys no such important information. The distant tremulous sound of its wheels was heard just as I gained the summit of the gentle ascent, called the Goslin-brae, from which you command an extensive view down the valley of the river Gander. The public road, which comes up the side of that stream, and crosses it at a bridge {{about a quarter of a}} mile from the place where I was standing, runs partly through enclosures and plantations, and partly through open pasture land. It is a childish amusement perhaps,--but my life has been spent with children, and why should not my pleasures be like theirs?--childish as it is then, I must own I have had great pleasure in watching {{the approach of the}} carriage, where the openings of the <b>road</b> <b>permit</b> it to be seen. The gay glancing of the equipage, its diminished and toy-like appearance at a distance, contrasted with the rapidity of its motion, its appearance and disappearance at intervals, and the progressively increasing sounds that announce its nearer approach, have all to the idle and listless spectator, who has nothing more important to attend to, something of awakening interest. The ridicule may attach to me, which is flung upon many an honest citizen, who watches from the window of his villa the passage of the stage-coach; but it is a very natural source of amusement notwithstanding, and many of those who join in the laugh are perhaps not unused to resort to it in secret.|$|E

5000|$|The German-language MTV Central has two {{adaptations of}} the show called Pimp My Fahrrad (English: [...] "Pimp My Bicycle") and Pimp My Whatever. On Pimp My Fahrrad http://www.mtv.de/shows/428-pimp-my-ride, the bike shop Elbcoast Psycles redoes almost the entire bicycle, usually leaving only the frame intact. While the show {{could be seen as}} a parody of the American original, it is also a loving tribute, using all the {{elements}} of the American show with a bicycle twist (Germany's safety guidelines are among the strictest in the world, and getting a <b>road</b> <b>permit</b> for thoroughly customized vehicles borders on the impossible. Similar rules apply in most of continental Europe). It is hosted by German actor Oliver Korittke. In Pimp My Whatever http://www.mtv.de/shows/428-pimp-my-ride ElbCoast Psychos return once more to pimp anything from a bathroom and a doghouse to a birthday party or even someone's brother. Pimp My Whatever is hosted by MTV presenter Patrice Bouédibéla. Both shows are located in Hamburg. The original United States Pimp My Ride is shown in English language with German subtitles.|$|E
60|$|Hendrik {{looked over}} the sleigh and the harness with care, and {{quarter of an hour}} later they were moving toward Bojowak as rapidly as the state of the <b>road</b> <b>permitted.</b> They had to pass through two hollows, and here the men and boys walked, for it was all the double team could do to get through.|$|R
25|$|In Canada, {{left turn}} on red {{light from a}} one-way road into a one-way <b>road</b> is <b>permitted</b> except {{in some areas of}} Quebec, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.

60|$|The knight {{continued}} {{to keep the}} good horse at a pace as quick as the <b>road</b> <b>permitted,</b> until they had cleared the valley of Glendearg, and entered upon the broad dale of the Tweed, which now rolled before them in crystal beauty, displaying on its opposite bank the huge gray Monastery of St. Mary's, whose towers and pinnacles were scarce yet touched by the newly-risen sun, so deeply the edifice lies shrouded under the mountains which rise to the southward.|$|R

50|$|The Hobie 33 is a 33 ft monohull lift-keel boat {{designed}} to be very light and very fast. It is considered a ULDB or ultralight displacement boat, a Sportsboat. It {{was intended to be}} a trailerable, one design racer/cruiser. To be trailerable in all U.S. states without special overwidth <b>road</b> <b>permits,</b> beam was kept to just 8 feet, which is quite narrow for a boat of this length, although the Hobie 33 was advertised as being capable of sleeping 7 people. A total of 187 Hobie 33s were built between 1982 and 1986.|$|R

60|$|The {{news that}} Major Grant's command had been whipped and driven back, {{and the major}} {{and many of his}} {{officers}} taken prisoners, was quickly sent to General Forbes, and at once a council of war was held. It was decided that the entire army should be sent forward without delay, and the soldiers moved onward as rapidly as the state of the <b>road</b> <b>permitted.</b> By the time the re-enforcements arrived the French and Indians had retreated to Fort Duquesne, for additional ammunition and general supplies, and {{to take care of their}} wounded and prisoners.|$|R

60|$|The {{team was}} turned around {{as well as}} the narrow {{confines}} of the hilly <b>road</b> <b>permitted,</b> and soon the Rover boys were on their way back to Putnam Hall, a proceeding which pleased Tom in more ways than one, since he would not have now to put up at a strange resort to have his ankle and his wheel cared for. They bowled along at a rapid gait, the horses having more speed in them than their appearance indicated. They were just turning into the road leading to Putnam Hall grounds when Dick espied several cadets approaching, bound for the lake shore.|$|R

50|$|A {{proposal}} {{was made to}} align a new bridge with Geelong <b>Road,</b> <b>permitting</b> traffic flows to bypass the main shopping precinct and primary school, but with the consequence of taking out three homes. An independent panel was appointed by the then Minister for Planning, Rob Hulls to decide on a location. Evidence was presented, for and against Geelong Road, and the existing site, and concluded that Geelong Road was unsuitable for environmental, social, economic reasons. On 16 March 2007 {{it was announced that}} the current bridge would be improved and there were no plans to build a second bridge upstream. The new road bridge and a parallel pedestrian bridge were constructed in 2010.|$|R
50|$|The ongoing Israeli {{occupation}} of the Palestinian Territories and expansion of Israeli settlements, until 2005 also in Gaza, furthered hostilities between Palestinians and Israelis. During the Second Intifada in 2000, in response to Palestinian attacks on both Israeli soldiers and civilians, Israel tightened the borders. A comprehensive system of restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians within the West Bank was developed. This system consists of physical obstacles (checkpoints, roadblocks, the West Bank barrier), and administrative restrictions (prohibited <b>roads,</b> <b>permit</b> requirements, age restrictions. Since Hamas' takeover of Gaza in 2007, Israel imposes a complete blockade of the Gaza Strip, restricting imports and fishing areas, {{and the movement of}} goods and people between West Bank and Gaza.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} of travel, it was customary for many people, including women, to travel long distances. [...] Upper-class wives frequently accompanied their husbands on crusade or to tournaments, and many women traveled for social or family engagements; both nuns and laywomen would perform pilgrimages. When not on foot, women would usually travel on horseback or, if weakened or infirm, be carried in a wagon or a litter. If <b>roads</b> <b>permitted,</b> women sometimes rode in early carriages developed from freight wagons, pulled by three or four horses. After the invention of better suspension systems, travel in carriages became more comfortable. [...] Women of the nobility also rode horses for sport, accompanying men in activities that included hunting and hawking.|$|R

5000|$|The 1988 statute {{authorizing the}} private toll <b>road</b> <b>permitted</b> toll {{increases}} above {{the rate of}} inflation under a three-part test: (1) the new fee must not [...] "materially discourage" [...] drivers from using the road, (2) the company must not make more than a [...] "reasonable rate of return" [...] from the increase, and (3) the road's benefit must match its cost. [...] Critics claim that the drop in use following the 2009 toll increase is evidence that the test has not been met. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), the Congressman representing the area served by the road, stated, [...] "It's highway robbery. It's a disgrace. Everyone knows that these tolls are ripping people off and there's not much we can do about it." ...|$|R
60|$|Bob rode {{alone and}} in advance, while Ralph rode with George, {{the two teams}} driving along side by side {{whenever}} {{the width of the}} <b>road</b> would <b>permit,</b> in order that the occupants might talk over and over again the prospects of finding oil on the Simpson wood-lot.|$|R
25|$|Later, {{where the}} quality of the <b>road</b> <b>permitted,</b> the range might be {{extended}} by the use of charrettes (carts). When designed for this trade, with a minimum of weight put into their construction and provision for harnessing the four horses, these vehicles took the name of chasse-marée. As speed was essential, they were normally hauled by two pairs of horses. The vehicle took the form of two wheels, of a diameter large enough to minimize the slowing effect of bumps in the road. On their axle was mounted an open rectangular frame within which were slung the baskets holding the fish, packed in seaweed. More baskets were stacked above. The teams of usually fairly small horses were worked hard and changed at posting stations {{in the same way as}} those of mail coaches.|$|R
25|$|During the 1890s, trolley service {{through the}} village of Kenmore was {{extended}} along Military Road, and commuters who lived in Kenmore could now easily access the Belt Line, which would {{take them to the}} city of Buffalo for work.
