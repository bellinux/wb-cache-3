50|$|A basic {{web frame}} {{consists}} of a front rail which is usually visible {{from the front of}} the cabinet and two side rails which extend from the front to the rear of the cabinet. In many web frames, these side rails also serve as the drawer runners, on which the drawer itself slides. An optional <b>rear</b> <b>rail</b> may also be included.|$|E
5000|$|The Sinar F and F1 {{models have}} a clip-on front {{standard}} (lens standard) {{that does not}} fully enclose the monorail. The advantage is that this standard can easily {{be removed from the}} rail by loosening the clamp and lifting straight up, unlike the rear standard, and it is somewhat lighter weight. The disadvantage of this design is that the rail clamping mechanism is susceptible to breakage if over-tightened. [...] The Sinar F2 and F3 models have a different front standard, which completely encloses the rail and also provides a geared focus adjustment, similar to the <b>rear</b> <b>rail</b> clamp on all Sinar F models. The correct F2 standard can easily be identified as it is a mirror image of the rear standard. The earlier F/F1 front standard has a low-profile metal hinge below the rail.|$|E
50|$|The board's {{rails and}} deck {{may also be}} {{referred}} to as having rocker. A board with a v-shaped tail, for example, has had the lower/ outer portion of its <b>rear</b> <b>rails</b> reduced, increasing its tail rail rocker. Having a flat, even deck rocker will increase a board's flexibility, while a convex deck rocker creates a board that is thicker along the board's stringer and stiffer in the water.|$|R
50|$|The rear towing draw-bar {{consisted}} of a multiple-leaf horizontal leaf spring, spanning the <b>rear</b> chassis <b>rails.</b> This coupled the towing forces directly into the chassis, but also allowed jolts to be cushioned.|$|R
50|$|A key {{structural}} {{weakness of}} front-mounted support is the shear stress {{placed on the}} mounting rails and {{the leading edge of}} the equipment. As a result, 4-post racks have become common, with such racks featuring a mirrored pair of rear mounting posts. Since the spacing between the front and rear mounting posts may differ between rack vendors and/or the configuration of the rack (some racks may incorporate front and <b>rear</b> <b>rails</b> that may be moved forwards and backwards, i.e. APC SX-range racks), it's common for equipment that features 4-post mounting brackets, to have an adjustable rear bracket.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of vehicle crashworthiness and occupant protection are addressed. The vehicle crashworthiness design objectives are {{to design the}} vehicle structure for optimum impact energy absorption, and to design the restraint system (seatbelts, airbags, bolsters, etc.) for optimum occupant protection. The following approaches are taken; {{a major part of}} the impact energy is to be absorbed by the vehicle structure; the restraint components will provide protection against the remaining crash energy; certain vehicle components are designed to deform under specific types and speeds of impact in a desired mode for sound energy management; structural components such as front side <b>rails,</b> <b>rear</b> <b>rails,</b> door structure and pillars undergo large amounts of deformation; and with properly designed geometry and material these components assist in mitigating the effects of impact...|$|R
40|$|A {{pneumatic}} {{vehicle is}} provided with a first sub- assembly with a chassis, part of the vehicle body, a pair of B-pillars, a pair of <b>rear</b> <b>rails,</b> wheels, an elongate aluminum compressed load bearing air tank oriented longitudinally in the chassis, side panels connected to the tank and the wheels, a heat exchanger to heat the compressed air, and an air motor driven by the heated, compressed air and connected to a wheel. A ventilation system has a restrictive solenoid valve for directing air to the heat exchanger. The air tank {{is provided with}} a carbon filament reinforced plastic layer, and a fiberglass and aramid-fiber layer. A second sub-assembly includes part of the vehicle body bonded to the first-sub-assembly using a structural adhesive, a pair of A-pillars, {{and a pair of}} roof rails. Seating includes inflatable components for adjustment...|$|R
40|$|A {{pneumatic}} {{vehicle is}} provided with a first and second sub-assembly. The first sub-assembly has a chassis supporting an air tank. The second sub-assembly has part of the vehicle body and is bonded to the first-sub-assembly using a structural adhesive. Another pneumatic vehicle {{is provided with}} a first and second sub-assembly. The first sub-assembly has a chassis, air tank, part of the vehicle body, a pair of B-pillars, {{and a pair of}} <b>rear</b> <b>rails.</b> The second sub-assembly has a part of the vehicle body, a pair of A-pillars, and a pair of roof rails. A vehicle seat is provided with a seat base and upright seat back providing a seating area. A bladder located in the central region of the seating area inflates to provide two bucket seats, and deflates to provide a bench seat. The vehicle seat also has inflatable inserts to provide cushioning...|$|R
5000|$|XM107/M107: Initially used to {{designate}} 12.7×99mm Barrett M95 bolt-action rifle. Designation changed {{to apply to}} a product improved M82A1M variant. Includes lengthened accessory <b>rail,</b> <b>rear</b> grip, and monopod socket.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} for the depth of equipment, nor specifying the outer width and depth of the rack enclosure itself (incorporating the structure, doors and panels that contain the mounting rails), {{there is a tendency}} for 4-post racks to be 600 mm or 800 mm wide, and for them to be 600 mm, 800 mm or 1010 mm deep. This of course varies by manufacturer, the design of the rack and its purpose, but through common constraining factors (such as raised floor tile dimensions), these dimensions have become quite common. The extra width and depth enables cabling to be routed with ease (also helping to maintain bend-radius for fibre and copper cables) and deeper equipment to be utilised. A common feature in IT racks are mounting positions for [...] "Zero-U" [...] accessories, such as PDU (power distribution units) and vertical cable managers/ducts, that utilise the space between the <b>rear</b> <b>rails</b> and the side of the rack enclosure.|$|R
50|$|Similar to {{a ladder}} frame, but the middle {{sections}} of the frame rails sit outboard of the front and <b>rear</b> <b>rails</b> just behind the rocker / sill panels. This was done {{to allow for a}} lower floor pan, especially at the passenger footwells, to lower the passengers' seating height and therefore reduce the overall vehicle height in passenger cars. This became the prevalent design for body-on-frame cars in the United States, but not {{in the rest of the}} world, until the uni-body gained popularity. It allowed for annual model changes introduced in the 1950s to increase sales, but without costly structural changes. As of 2014, there are no perimeter frame automobiles sold in the United States after the Ford Motor Company phased out the Panther platform in 2011, which ended the perimeter frame passenger car in the United States (the Chevrolet Corvette has used a variation of the perimeter frame since 1963, but its fourth generation variant to its current generation as of 2016 has elements of the perimeter frame integrated with an internal endoskeleton which serves as a clamshell).|$|R
5000|$|PAZ buses are {{commonly}} employed by firefighters and police - for ordinary busing and as [...] "mobile headquarters". PAZ funeral buses have <b>rear</b> door, floor <b>rails</b> and safety straps for carrying a coffin in the rear. Passenger seats {{are arranged in}} long benches along the sides, facing the coffin.|$|R
50|$|The Nighthawk 700S {{bodywork}} (1984 - 1985) {{was mostly}} black in color - with either red or blue accent panels. In 1986, the 700SC's paint was mostly navy blue (with white accent decals with red pinstripes) or black (with red accent decals and tri-color pinstripes). Valve cover and clutch covers were painted black {{as well as}} the wheels. The engine was painted black with polished edges on the cylinder head fins. Other components were also enameled in black including the lower fork legs, handlebars, and <b>rear</b> grab <b>rails.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Torino was {{developed}} by IKA as an Argentine hybrid of AMC's 1964-'65 Rambler American and Classic with exclusively designed front and rear body panels, bumpers and interior. The central body section is from the Classic, and the engine and trunk compartments are derived from the American. Rooflines came from the American as well, and some later Torino sedans featured the attractive [...] "C" [...] pillar {{that was used in}} 1968-69 U.S. American sedans. The rear coil suspension was borrowed from the Classic, albeit with a four link setup rather than a torque tube. One unique feature is the Torino's front unibody [...] "frame rails" [...] borrowed from the Classic convertible (also used in the 1965-'66 Marlin). They are longer than the American, extending all the way back under the car {{to the front of the}} <b>rear</b> <b>rails.</b> This made for a stiffer chassis, better adapting the car to the rougher road conditions of Argentina at the time. The Torino rode on a slightly longer wheelbase (than the American) by one inch - 2723 mm (107-inch). Although the engines were not obtained from American Motors, the vehicle's basic AMC platform continued throughout its lifetime. As upgrades were incorporated over the years, such as AMC's flush door handles, the Torino became mostly a product of Argentina with few imported parts.|$|R
5000|$|Safari (UK, 1998): Again {{based on}} the seven-seat GS, the Safari was painted Epsom Green and was {{equipped}} with a <b>rear</b> ladder, roof <b>rails,</b> and additional fog lamps. It was available with either the V8 or Tdi engine, although the manual gearbox was only offered {{in conjunction with the}} Tdi. A total of 1,100 were built.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{structural}} behaviour of {{a bicycle}} saddle is mainly {{affected by the}} shell and the rails properties and by their assembly connections. The knowledge of the stress acting on these components is therefore fundamental for a safe and performing saddle engineering design. The aim of the work was the measurement {{and analysis of the}} strain/stress state of shell and rails of a bicycle saddle during real cycling conditions. The shell and the rails of a saddle were instrumented with a total of 16 strain gauge channels, allowing the measurement of the local deformations of shell and rails. Two field test sessions (one for road cycling and one for mountain bike riding) were performed with two professional cyclists different for body height and weight (65 and 76 kg). Reported results regard the analysis of rails cyclic stresses due to road pedalling and of stress cumulative spectra obtained during road and mountain bike sessions. Right and the left portions of the rails were loaded symmetrically. The two testers showed large differences in the pedalling style and in the cycling posture. The stress on the front and <b>rear</b> <b>rails</b> portions was mainly influenced by the cyclist posture and pedalling style. An increase of the road slope caused an increment of the stress range and mean values; the damage ratio between mountain bike and road load spectra for an equivalent cycled distance resulted to range between 6 and 9, depending on the tester involved...|$|R
50|$|Available wheelbases were; 135.5 inches, 159.5 inches, and 183.5 inches. The C3500 HD {{frames are}} very {{different}} from the C/K3500 cab and chassis. The C/K3500 cab and chassis and C3500 HD <b>rear</b> frame <b>rails</b> are spaced at industry standard 34 inches for easy fitment of bodies but that is where the similarity ends. The HD frame is much heavier and exits straight out behind the high mounted cab necessitating the unmistakable HD filler panel between the bumper and grille. The front fenders were also equipped with the same flares used on 4x4 models of the lighter trucks to cover the increased track width and larger tires.|$|R
50|$|Small tire race - Two {{cars that}} race {{with a set}} cars with tires smaller {{than or equal to}} 28.5 in and or equal 12.5 in of tread. This type of racing usually assumes that the <b>rear</b> frame <b>rails</b> and {{suspension}} are not radically modified. Small tires limit how much power that the car can apply to the ground. There are also legally sanctioned races that separate cars into classes based on tire size and chassis modifications. There are even entire legally sanctioned racing events limited to only small tire cars and cars that use DOT approved tree legal tires rather than racing slicks.|$|R
25|$|Standard {{equipment}} for 1953 included bumper guards, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, chrome moldings, twin interior sun visors, <b>rear</b> seat robe <b>rails,</b> special <b>rear</b> stainless steel trim, chrome window ventiplanes, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. In 1953 a padded safety dash also became standard on the 98. For {{the first time}} air conditioning was an option.|$|R
50|$|On {{the east}} {{is a large}} open drawing room, created by {{removing}} the wall that separated the two parlors. Some of the original 12-inch (30.5 cm) flooring planks, with forged-head nails, remain in the corner. A firebrick fireplace with neoclassical mantel {{is located on the}} end wall. French doors open to the exterior from the <b>rear.</b> A chair <b>rail</b> runs the length of the wall.|$|R

50|$|The M18's {{new design}} {{incorporated}} several labor saving and innovative maintenance features. The Wright R975 engine was fully unitized, {{as it was}} mounted on rails equipped with steel rollers that allowed maintenance crews to disconnect it easily from the transmission, roll it out onto the lowered engine <b>rear</b> cover using <b>rails,</b> service it, and then reconnect it to the transmission. The transmission could also be removed easily and rolled out onto a front deck plate to facilitate quick inspection and repairs.|$|R
50|$|By June 1999, {{minor changes}} were made. In order to follow new laws, fog-lamps {{were added to}} the bumper, except in South Africa. In July 2000, a new diesel engine, the 3.0 L (2982 cc) Common Rail Diesel Injection (D-4D) 1KD-FTV was {{introduced}} into this model. To reduce theft, an engine immobilizer was available. TX Limited with 8 seats used TX base with roof <b>rail,</b> <b>rear</b> under mirror, wood panel finish, armrest, optitron meter, base cooling as well as rear heater was introduced into this series.|$|R
50|$|The British Rail Class 02 were a {{class of}} twenty 0-4-0 diesel-hydraulic {{shunting}} locomotives built by the Yorkshire Engine Company in 1960 (first ten, D2850-D2859) and 1961 (D2860-D2869) for service in areas of restricted loading gauge and curvature such as docks. They had {{the door to the}} cab at the <b>rear,</b> with a <b>railed</b> veranda behind the cab; this feature was very unusual on British Rail locomotives although was used on many Yorkshire Engine Co. designs and was/is quite normal in North American practice.|$|R
50|$|Big tire race - Two {{cars that}} race {{with a set}} of tires taller than 28.5 inches tall and or wider than 12.5 inches of tread. Typically this term is used in {{reference}} to the rear tires of cars used in straight line racing, and refers to a car that has modifications to the <b>rear</b> framer <b>rails</b> and suspension system to allow the large tires to fit under the car, but sometimes low budget racers will simply cut the body panels of the car and allow the large tires to extend beyond the body width of the car. Cutting the body is a modification that is considered substandard and if often done to falsely make a car look like it is not built well in the hope of convincing other racers that the car isn't very fast, with the hopes the other racers will offer a handicap start.|$|R
5000|$|The {{machines}} {{have two}} printers which can print on, and encode the magnetic stripes on the <b>rear</b> of, <b>Rail</b> Settlement Plan-accredited ticket stock. [...] This has a batch code of RSP No. 9399 {{and consists of}} fanfold (concertina-style) packs of round-cornered tickets joined to each other by perforated lugs which are cut during the printing process. An experimental ticket stock with diagonal corners {{was used in the}} earliest trial machines. [...] In common with other [...] "New Generation" [...] (post-privatisation) ticket issuing systems, the ticket stock has no pre-printed data other than some conditions on the reverse; all data is printed by the machine. [...] Machines accept either payment cards only or both cards and cash. On the latter, banknotes and coins are checked electronically. [...] Keypads for Chip and PIN card payments were fitted retrospectively on older machines, and as standard on newer machines, when this technology was introduced.|$|R
50|$|The range {{consists}} of two trim levels; LT and LTZ. Standard equipment for all Colorado 7s includes cruise control, body-coloured bumpers, side steps, front fog lights, aluminium roof <b>rails,</b> <b>rear</b> parking sensors (in addition to the rear camera), Bluetooth phone connectivity, USB input, roof mounted climate control vents for second and third rows and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with multifunction controls. The LTZ adds 18-inch wheels, projector headlights, exterior chrome highlights, leather seats, a premium sounds system, a six-way adjustable driver’s seat, higher grade interior trim elements and LED tail-lights.|$|R
50|$|The {{tailplane}} {{was fixed}} {{halfway up the}} sharply-swept fin, and all control surfaces were manually driven by rods which ran down a dorsal spine extending along the upper surface of the aircraft, ending {{at the rear of}} the canopy. The long, continuous canopy was of blown Plexiglas, and bulged to give a better downward view. It slid to the <b>rear</b> on long <b>rails.</b> The ejection seats could both be fired by the instructor, while the pupil could fire only his own seat. Both cockpit positions had a complete set of controls.|$|R
2500|$|Tanbark {{was used}} to {{manufacture}} tannic acid, necessary to the growing leather tanning industry located in Santa Cruz, and to preserve fish nets. The tanbark was harvested from the isolated trees inland, left to dry, corded, and brought out on mules or hauled out on [...] "go-devils". The go-devil was a wagon with two wheels on the front, while the <b>rear</b> had <b>rails</b> for pulling. Notley constructed a landing {{at the mouth of}} the Palo Colorado River like that at Bixby Landing to the south. The tanbark was loaded by cable onto waiting vessels anchored offshore at Notley's Landing. In 1889, as much as 50,000 cords of tanbark were hauled out from the Little Sur River and Big Sur River watersheds. A small village grew up around Notley's Landing from 1898 to 1907. [...] Near the start of the 20th century, the tan oak trees were becoming seriously depleted, which slowly led to the demise of the industries they had created.|$|R
5000|$|Honda {{released}} this motorcycle {{to compete with}} the Bajaj Pulsar and the TVS Apache. Changes included alloy wheels, powder coated engine with a polished head, electric starter, new graphics, clear lens indicator lamps, a trip meter, and a slightly smaller <b>rear</b> grab <b>rail.</b> Few performance changes included minor changes in the cylinder head, overhead valve, ignition remap and a rear sprocket increase of one tooth, which resulted in increased acceleration at the expense of reduced top speed.The airfilter was changed from a dry paper to oil coated to better suit dusty conditions and a new airflow screw in carburetor. A limited Moto GP [...] "Unicorn Grand Prix" [...] edition had the guise of a Repsol Honda RC211V. [...] HMSI sold 720,000 Unicorns in 2007.

50|$|The LX {{platform}} is Chrysler's full-size {{rear wheel drive}} automobile platform for the mid {{part of the first}} decade of the 21st century. The LX was developed in America to supersede the previous Chrysler LH platform, which had been designed to allow it to be easily upgraded to rear and all-wheel drive. Mercedes parts were used to save costs, including some shared with the Mercedes-Benz W220 S-class, and the Mercedes-Benz W211 E-Class 5-link <b>rear</b> suspension, seat <b>rails,</b> steering column, the W5A580 5-speed automatic, the rear differential, and the ESP system. The LX cars are built at Brampton Assembly in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. The European variant and all RHD models were built in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr from June 2005 until 2010, where they carried the platform designation of LE.|$|R
5000|$|The Barrett M107 is a [...]50 caliber, shoulder-fired, {{semi-automatic}} sniper rifle. Like its predecessors, {{the rifle}} {{is said to}} have manageable recoil for a weapon of its size owing to the barrel assembly that itself absorbs force, moving inward toward the receiver against large springs with every shot. Additionally, the weapon's weight and large muzzle brake also assist in recoil reduction. Various changes were made to the original M82A1 to create the M107, with new features such as a lengthened accessory <b>rail,</b> <b>rear</b> grip, and monopod socket. Barrett has recently been asked to develop a lightweight version of the M107 under the Anti-Materiel Sniper Rifle Congressional Program, and has already come up with a scheme to build important component parts such as the receiver frame and muzzle brake out of lighter-weight materials.|$|R
5000|$|A {{version of}} 2012 model year Jeep Wrangler and Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon {{inspired}} by Activision's Call of Duty video games was available.

50|$|The {{grinding}} {{quality index}} (GQI) is a software-based template {{used to measure}} the profile of a rail. This allows the desired rail profile to be compared to the actual rail profile. GQI software makes use of laser-based hardware mounted to the front and <b>rear</b> of the <b>rail</b> grinder. The use of laser-based hardware on maintenance of way vehicles such as rail grinders allow workers and contractors take precise measurements of the rail profile before and after grinding. The GQI is rated from 0 (low priority) to 100 (high priority). Grinding Quality Software is able to record and document measurements independently and provide a GQI rating for each rail on the track for before and after each pass on the grinder. The advantage of using GQI software is the ability to produce post-grinding reports for later usage by planners to help further prioritize and monitor grinding profiles in the future. GQI reports also provide analysis on the consistency of profiling to determine if grinding operations are consistently improving or deteriorating the rail profile. The usage of GQI software also provides the ability to produce accurate assessments of rail grinder effectiveness in real-time which allows for work to be prioritized more efficiently and be executed in a timely manner.|$|R
