40|$|Because the {{concentration}} of serum myoglobin (Mb) increases within 2 to 4 hours after {{the first sign of}} acute myocardial infarction, it has been proposed as an early marker of the condition. Our aim was to evaluate a new assay that provides a rapid, quantitative determination of Mb (Baxter Stratus Myoglobin) based on the <b>radial</b> <b>partition</b> technique. We compared the results obtained by this technique with those from nephelometric and radioimmunoassay methods. A significant agreement was observed, the correlation coefficients (r) being 0. 999 and 0. 996, respectively. The method evaluated provided good reproducibility with CVs between 3. 14 % and 4. 87 %, and its linearity and analytical sensitivity were satisfactory. The clinical evaluation of this assay demonstrates that Mb increases in serum of patients with acute myocardial infarction before total creatine kinase and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme. Mb concentration shows an early peak and earlier return to normal values after the necrosis compared to enzymatic activities. Moreover the assay is rapid and fully automated. The method is therefore considered appropriate for contributing to the early diagnosis of AMI in clinical laboratories. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E

A production-model hollow steel propeller was modified with an Internal <b>radial</b> <b>partition</b> at 25 -percent chord and with shank and tip openings to admit and exhaust the heated air.

Surface temperature measurements indicated that confining the heated air forward of the 25 -percent chord gave. a more economical distribution of the applied heat as compared with unpartitioned and 50 -percent partitioned blades, by dissipating {{a greater percentage of}} the available heat at the leading edge. At a propeller speed of 850 rpm, a heating rate of 7000 Btu per hour per blade at a shank air temperature of 400 F provided adequate Icing protection at ambient-air temperatures of 23 F but not at temperatures as low as 15 F.

40|$|With the {{increasingly}} growing size of digital image collections, known image search is gaining {{more and more}} importance. Especially in collections where individual objects are not tagged with metadata describing their content, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a promising approach, but usually suffers from the unavailability of query images that are good enough to express the user's information need.

The chordwise distribution of the applied heat, as determined by surface temperature measurements, was considered unsatisfactory with much of the heat dissipated well back of the leading edge. Heat-exchanger effectiveness of approximately 56 percent also Indicated poor utilization of available heat.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Exceptionally large {{quantities}} of outstandingly well-preserved, free specimens of larger foraminifera from late Miocene sediments of the Dominican Republic invite an analysis of their structure in detail. The structures of the porcelaneous larger foraminifera reveal {{that most of them}} are not candidates for a direct ancestry of the species living today in the Caribbean. Although the late Miocene period has produced Caribbean endemists, in particular within the agglutinated group of the textulariellids and the lamellar-perforate group of the amphisteginids, the porcelaneous archaiasines and soritines are more closely related to the early Miocene forms of the Neotethys than to the Recent Caribbean endemists. These relationships are derived from their relative structural similarity and call for the proposition of appropriate additional taxa on the generic and specific levels. Miocene Miarchaias new genus develops several centimeters large, cyclical agamonts with meandropsinid structures covering the lateral surface of the disc (M. meander new species) whereas species of smaller shell size do not have cyclical generations (M. modestus new species). On the other hand, populations of cyclical schizonts and/or gamonts exhibit structures similar to the Recent, spiral Androsina: Androsinopsis radians new genus and species. The other new taxa erected here, Annulosorites spiralis new genus and species and Cyclorbiculina miocaenica new species, reflect differences in the apertural face and the respective arrangement of <b>radial</b> <b>partitions</b> as used to differentiate Recent Sorites from Amphisorus. Specimens to be attributed to the genera Cycloputeolina and Parasorites are present in the late Miocene of the Dominican Republic. They exhibit an exoskeleton in contrast to true soritids, and will need an eventual worldwide revision on the species level...|$|R

However, there are not available techniques enabling us to efficiently select the sizes of the local PU subdomains which, together with the value of the RBF shape parameter, greatly influence the accuracy of the final fit. Thus here, by minimizing an a priori error estimate, we propose a RBF-PU method by suitably selecting variable shape parameters and subdomain sizes.

40|$|The {{price of}} an option can under some {{assumptions}} {{be determined by}} the solution of the Black–Scholes partial differential equation. Often options are issued on more than one asset. In this case {{it turns out that the}} option price is governed by the multi-dimensional version of the Black–Scholes equation. Options issued on a large number of underlying assets, such as index options, are of particular interest, but pricing such options is a challenge due to the "curse of dimensionality". The multi-dimensional PDE turn out to be computationally expensive to solve accurately even in quite a low number of dimensions. In this thesis we develop a <b>radial</b> basis function <b>partition</b> of unity method for pricing multi-asset options up to moderately high dimensions. Our approach requires the use of a lower number of node points per dimension than other standard PDE methods, such as finite differences or finite elements, thanks to a high order convergence rate. Our method shows good results for both European style options and American style options, which allow early exercise. For the options which do not allow early exercise, the method exhibits an exponential convergence rate under node refinement. For options that allow early exercise the option pricing problem becomes a free boundary problem. We incorporate two different approaches for handling the free boundary into the <b>radial</b> basis function <b>partition</b> of unity method: a penalty method, which leads to a nonlinear problem, and an operator splitting method, which leads to a splitting scheme. We show that both methods allow for locally high algebraic convergence rates, but it turns out that the operator splitting method is computationally more efficient than the penalty method. The main reason is that there is no need to solve a nonlinear problem, which is the case in the penalty formulation. eSSENC...|$|R
40|$|Radial basis {{function}} methods exhibit several {{very attractive}} properties {{such as a}} high order convergence of the approximated solution and flexibility to the domain geometry. However the method in its classical formulation becomes impractical for problems with relatively large numbers of degrees of freedom due to the ill-conditioning and dense structure of coefficient matrix. To overcome the latter issue we employ a localisation technique, namely a partition of unity method, while the former issue was previously addressed by several authors and was of less concern in this thesis. In this thesis we develop <b>radial</b> basis function <b>partition</b> of unity methods for partial differential equations arising in financial mathematics and glaciology. In the applications of financial mathematics we focus on pricing multi-asset equity and credit derivatives whose models involve several stochastic factors. We demonstrate that localised radial basis function methods are very effective and well-suited for financial applications thanks to the high order approximation properties that allow for the reduction of storage and computational requirements, which is crucial in multi-dimensional problems {{to cope with the}} curse of dimensionality. In the glaciology application we in the first place make use of the meshfree nature of the methods and their flexibility with respect to the irregular geometries of ice sheets and glaciers. Also, we exploit the fact that radial basis function methods are stated in strong form, which is advantageous for approximating velocity fields of non-Newtonian viscous liquids such as ice, since it allows to avoid a full coefficient matrix reassembly within the nonlinear iteration. In addition to the applied problems we develop a least squares <b>radial</b> basis function <b>partition</b> of unity method that is robust with respect to the node layout. The method allows for scaling to problem sizes of a few hundred thousand nodes without encountering the issue of large condition numbers of the coefficient matrix. This property is enabled by the possibility to control the coefficient matrix condition number by the rate of oversampling and the mode of refinement...|$|R

Thus a level planar graph {{can be drawn}} with the vertices of every Vj, 1 ≤ j ≤ k, placed on a horizontal line, representing the level lj, and without crossings of edges, which can be drawn as straight line segments between the levels. Healy, Kuusik and Leipert gave a complete characterization of minimal forbidden subgraphs for level planar graphs (MLNP patterns) for hierarchies [4]. Minimal in terms of deleting an ar- bitrary edge leads to level planarity. A <b>radial</b> graph <b>partitions</b> the vertex set on radii, which can be pictured as concentric circles, instead of levels, lj = (j cos(α), j sin(α)), α ∈ [0, 2 π), mapped around a shared center, where j, 1 ≤ j ≤ k indicates the concentric circles’ radius. Comparing embeddings of radial graphs with that of level graphs we gain a further possibility to place an edge and eventually avoid edge crossings which we wish to prevent for planarity reasons. This offers {{a new set of}} minimal radial non planar subgraphs (MRNP patterns). Some of the MLNP pat- terns can be adopted as MRNP patterns while some turn out to be radial planar. But based on the radial planar MLNP patterns and the use of augmentation we can build additional MRNP patterns that did not occur in the level case. Furthermore we point out a new upper bound for the number of edges of radial planar graphs. It depends on the subgraphs in- duced between two radii. Because of the MRNP patterns these subgraphs can either consist of a forest or a cycle with several branches. Applying the bound we are able to characterize extremal radial planar graphs.
