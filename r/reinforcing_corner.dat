Especially popular were crossed struts that formed a St. Andrew's Cross. Timber framed buildings continued to be erected until the mid-19th century. Then there was a change: in the southern Bresse rammed earth (Stampflehm) was increasingly used for the walls, which usually had <b>reinforced</b> <b>corners</b> of brick or stone, and the façades were covered with rammed earth. In the northern Bresse, brick has generally been used since the 19th century, albeit bricks of low quality.

40|$|Synopsis: This paper {{presents}} {{the performance of}} a full-scale <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>corner</b> beam-column-slab specimen that was first severely damaged under bidirectional quasi-static loading, then rehabilitated and retested. The specimen was built using the pre- 1970 s construction practices including the use of low-strength materials (3000 psi [21 MPa], Grade 40 reinforcing bars) and deficiencies in reinforcement detailing. The rehabilitation process consisted of: (1) epoxy injection, (2) addition of a bar within the clear cover of the column at the inside corner, and (3) external application of a multilayer composite system made of unidirectional carbon-epoxy layers placed at different orientations. The carbon fiber-reinforced polymeric system was heat-cured at a temperature of 80 °± 10 °C (176 °± 18 °F) for 6 hours. The performance was evaluated both before and after rehabilitation based on the progression of damage and the hysteretic behavior including the changes in the strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation characteristics. The results indicated that even a severely damaged corner joint can be effectively rehabilitated using CFRP to achieve a ductile beam failure mechanism. The joint was upgraded to withstand story drift ratios of up to 3. 7 % applied simultaneously in both directions...|$|R

40|$|Deflection {{is usually}} {{controlled}} {{by limiting the}} span/depth ratio. One aspect {{of this research is}} to document the deflection of a concrete slab in a large residential block. The other part of the research is to look at current design limits. Limits on deformation were set many decades ago, when the forms of construction, partitions, finishing, cladding and service were very different from what they are now.

Analysis of previously tested frame specimens, with both spliced and unspliced corner reinforcement, was used to study the overall behavior of the frames; more detailed analysis of only the frame corner regions was used to study the influence of the reinforcement splices. The analyses were found to reflect the mechanical behavior of the specimens, and are in good agreement with the test results.

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{performance}} of a proposed scheme for seismic strengthening of shear deficient joints of 3 D <b>reinforced</b> concrete (RC) <b>corner</b> beam-column connections. This technique is composed of a combination of GFRP sheets and a steel cage, and does not require perforating the existing concrete elements to anchor the FRP sheets. Two similar full-scale beam-column connections were made without any transverse reinforcement in their joint region. One of which was tested in its as-built condition, taken as the control specimen, while the other one was tested after strengthening. Seismic behaviour of these specimens was studied under a cyclic loading pattern imposed simultaneously with a constant column’s axial load. Comparison of the test results of these specimens revealed a noticeable improvement in the seismic response of the strengthened specimen. This achievement along with the application feasibility of this technique indicates the suitability of the proposed strengthening scheme for practical applications. Finally, the experimentally obtained joint shear strength of the control and retrofitted specimens are compared to the one estimated by the relationships of the softened strut-and-tie model and ACI- 318, respectively. This comparison revealed a satisfactory prediction of joint shear strength for both specimens, the as-built and the strengthened one...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} behavior of nonseismically detailed reinforced concrete exterior beam-column joints subjected to bidirectional lateral cyclic loading using nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA). Beam-column joints constitute a critical component in the load path of reinforced concrete buildings due to their fundamental role in integrating the overall structural system. Earthquake reconnaissance reports reveal that failure of joints has contributed to partial or complete collapse of reinforced concrete buildings designed without consideration for large lateral loads, resulting in significant economic impact and loss of life. Such infrastructure exists throughout seismically active regions worldwide, and the large-scale risk associated with such deficiencies is not fully known. Computational strategies provide a useful complement to the existing experimental literature on joint behavior and are needed to more fully characterize the failure processes in seismically deficient beam-column joints subjected to realistic failure conditions. Prior to this study, vulnerable <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>corner</b> beam-column joints including the slab had not been analyzed using nonlinear finite element analysis and compared with experimental results. The {{first part of this}} research focused on identification and validation of a constitutive modeling strategy capable of simulating the behaviors known to dominate failure of beam-column joints under cyclic lateral load using NLFEA. This prototype model was formulated by combining a rotating smeared crack concrete constitutive model with a reinforcing bar plasticity model and nonlinear bond-slip formulation. This model was systematically validated against experimental data, and parametric studies were conducted to determine the sensitivity of the response to various material properties. The prototype model was then used to simulate the cyclic response of four seismically deficient beam-column joints which had been previously evaluated experimentally. The simulated joints included: a one-way exterior joint, a two-way beam-column exterior corner joint, and a series of two-way beam-column-slab exterior corner joints with varying degrees of seismic vulnerability. The two-way corner joint specimens were evaluated under simultaneous cyclic bidirectional lateral and cyclic column axial loading. For each specimen, the ability of the prototype model to capture the strength, stiffness degradation, energy dissipation, joint shear strength, and progressive failure mechanisms (e. g. cracking) was demonstrated.
