50|$|<b>Roue</b> <b>de</b> Moulin is {{the first}} one to stay at the castle, and he is {{preparing}} soup for dinner. All of a sudden, he hears a noise coming from the chimney. Then, a hand, an arm, an ear, and a head fall down the chimney like hail, and they form together to become a man. This man is the devil, and he asks <b>Roue</b> <b>de</b> Moulin to light his pipe. However, <b>Roue</b> <b>de</b> Moulin doesn't light his pipe, so the devil beats him up and prevents <b>Roue</b> <b>de</b> Moulin from finishing the dinner or ringing the bell. The others come back to the castle without hearing the bell, but <b>Roue</b> <b>de</b> Moulin fabricates an excuse and doesn't reveal what really happened. In the coming days, Coupe Chêne and Porte Montagne have the same experience as <b>Roue</b> <b>de</b> Moulin.|$|R

40|$|A mode {{based on}} an {{additive}} mechanism of heat transfer is proposed for forced convection subcooled boiling of binary mixtures. The contributing modes of heat transfer are: (i) the heat transferred as latent heat by the rising bubbles, (ii) the heat transferred as the heat contained in the superheated thermal layer that {{is removed from the}} surface {{in the wake of the}} rising bubbles and (iii) the single phase forced convection heat transfer from the heating surface not influenced by the bubbles.
