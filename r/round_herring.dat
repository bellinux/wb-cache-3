50|$|<b>Round</b> <b>herrings</b> {{are found}} in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, from the Bay of Fundy to Florida and the Gulf of Mexico.

50|$|Canned {{sardines}} {{in supermarkets}} {{may actually be}} sprat (such as the “brisling sardine”) or <b>round</b> <b>herrings.</b> Fish sizes vary by species. Good quality sardines should have the head and gills removed before packing. They may also be eviscerated before packing (typically the larger varieties). If not, they should be purged of undigested or partially digested food or feces by holding the live fish in a tank long {{enough for them to}} empty their digestive systems.|$|R

50|$|Madagascar has a rich {{freshwater}} fish fauna {{with a very}} high rate of endemics. The full diversity is unclear, as new species are being described regularly and species may have disappeared before even being discovered; estimates suggest the island has between 135 and 150 native fish species that are restricted to freshwater (this number grows significantly if including widespread euryhaline species). Among these are two families entirely restricted to Madagascar, the anchariid catfish and the Madagascar rainbowfish. Additionally, several genera are endemic to Madagascar, including cichlids (Katria, Oxylapia, Paratilapia, Paretroplus, Ptychochromis and Ptychochromoides), <b>round</b> <b>herrings</b> (Sauvagella and Spratellomorpha), Old World silverside (Teramulus), sleeper gobies (Ratsirakia and the troglobitic Typhleotris), and aplocheilid killifish (Pachypanchax - strictly speaking near-endemic, {{as there is a}} single species from the Seychelles). There are endemic species from other genera (notably Ambassis, Arius, Eleotris, Glossogobius, Kuhlia, Mesopristes, Ophiocara, Pantanodon and Sicyopterus), but these also have other species found elsewhere.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Black Noddy (Anous minutus) and the Brown Noddy (A. stolidus) occur sympatrically in the Southern Lagoon of New Caledonia, {{breeding}} on islets {{located at}} the edge of a wide, productive coral-reef lagoon next to oceanic waters enriched by a seasonal upwelling. The diets of the two species were determined from regurgitations from birds nesting at Kouaré Islet during two consecutive breeding seasons (2002 / 2003 and 2003 / 2004), and compared. The average prey load in the Brown Noddy was heavier than that of the Black Noddy, as expected from its larger body size and from a predicted longer foraging distance. Fish prey dominated the diet of both species (100 % and 81. 8 % biomass in Black and Brown Noddies, respectively), the remainder consisting of squid. Black Noddy ate small pelagic fishes inhabiting the reef and the lagoon, mainly <b>round</b> <b>herrings</b> (Spratelloides spp.), while Brown Noddy mainly preyed on offshore species including buccaneer anchovy (Encrasicholina punctifer) and larger pelagic fishes (Exocoetidae), and squid. The segregation in diet between Black and Brown Noddies in New Caledonia thus indicated spatial segregation in foraging zones, i. e. inshore vs. offshore, respectively, which was more pronounced than previously reported for other sites where the two species co-occur...|$|R

5000|$|There are six broad {{categories}} of bird habitats near Long Island Sound: (1) open water areas, including bays, coves, rivers and the Sound itself; (2) tidal marshes; (3) mudflats; (4) sandy beaches; (5) offshore islands; and (6) mainland uplands, including woodlands and fields. Some birds are summer residents or winter residents, {{while others are}} spring and fall transients. Year <b>round</b> residents include <b>herring</b> gull, greater black-backed gull, common tern and double-crested cormorant. Much of the terns habitat and nesting areas have {{been taken over by}} the over-abundant comorant over the last several decades. The terns are now not commonly seen. Coastal migrants (also called [...] "transients") include shorebirds such as plovers, turnstones, sandpipers, willet and yellowlegs. Summer residents include the seaside sparrow, sharp-tailed sparrow, Nelson's sparrow, clapper rail, mallard and black duck, herons and egrets, including the black-crowned night heron and snowy egret as well as the least tern and piping plover. Upland species include the hooded warbler, white-eyed vireo, eastern meadowlark and Carolina wren.|$|R
