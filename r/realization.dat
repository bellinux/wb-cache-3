5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{identified}} the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being {{written in a}} mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic.

But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This <b>realization</b> finally made it possible for him to detach himself from the idea that the different scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being much more complex mixture of sign types.

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{solution to this}} problem, however, is to liberate the SI system's dependency on the IPK by developing a practical <b>realization</b> of the kilogram that can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification.

While major portions of the SI system would still be based on the kilogram, the kilogram would in turn be based on invariant, universal constants of nature.

Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop a practical <b>realization</b> based upon accelerating masses.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} design method of {{variable}} IIR digital filters based on balanced <b>realizations</b> and minimum round-off noise <b>realizations</b> of digital filters. Highly accurate vari-able digital filters are easily derived by the proposed method. The coefficient matrices of both <b>realizations</b> of second-order digital filters are obtained directly from prototype realiza-tions. The filter coefficients of variable digital filters {{can be obtained}} by frequency transformations to the <b>realizations.</b> The filter coefficients are presented as truncated Taylor se-ries for the purpose of reducing a number of calculations to tune the coefficients. However the proposed filters have highly accurate variable characteristics against the coeffi-cient truncation since balanced <b>realizations</b> and minimum round-off noise <b>realizations</b> have very low coefficient sen-sitivities, which are invariant under the frequency transfor-mations. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the variable digital filters designed by the proposed method. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} optimal {{remediation}} of heterogeneous aquifers based on stochastic simulation with adaptive determination of critical <b>realizations</b> is developed. Multiple hydraulic conductivity <b>realizations</b> are generated using the turning bands method while Monte Carlo simulation is {{incorporated into a}} multiobjective genetic optimization algorithm. In {{order to reduce the}} computational burden of Monte Carlo simulations, an adaptive procedure is developed for identifying ""critical realizations"" which are the ones that {{have an effect on the}} optimal solution depending on desired reliability level. The adaptive procedure is embedded into the genetic optimization algorithm where noncritical <b>realizations</b> are eliminated step by step during the advancement of optimization. When the number of remaining <b>realizations</b> reaches a minimum, some new <b>realizations</b> are added. The specific <b>realizations</b> which are removed or added in the critical set are selected by an automatic procedure controlled by a similarity criterion based on rankings of <b>realizations.</b> This is a significant improvement over the nonadaptive methodology for identification of critical <b>realizations</b> and does not require using a number of initial designs and a safety threshold. The methodology is applied in a remediation problem with two objectives (reduction of contaminant mass and cleanup cost). The applications indicate significant savings in computer time without loss of performance. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R
