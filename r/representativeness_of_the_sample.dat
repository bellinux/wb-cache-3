50|$|Stratification is {{the process}} of {{dividing}} members of the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling. The strata should be mutually exclusive: every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum.

This often improves the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> by reducing sampling error.|$|E
50|$|In {{statistical}} surveys, when subpopulations {{within an}} overall population vary, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently. Stratification {{is the process}} of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling. The strata should be mutually exclusive: every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. The strata should also be collectively exhaustive: no population element can be excluded. Then simple random sampling or systematic sampling is applied within each stratum. This often improves the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> by reducing sampling error. It can produce a weighted mean that has less variability than the arithmetic mean of a simple random sample of the population.|$|E
50|$|A single {{survey is}} made {{of at least a}} sample (or full {{population}} {{in the case of a}} census), a method of data collection (e.g., a questionnaire) and individual questions or items that become data that can be analyzed statistically. A single survey may focus on different types of topics such as preferences (e.g., for a presidential candidate), opinions (e.g., should abortion be legal?), behavior (smoking and alcohol use), or factual information (e.g., income), depending on its purpose. Since survey research is almost always based on a sample of the population, the success of the research is dependent on the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> with respect to a target population of interest to the researcher. That target population can range from the general population of a given country to specific groups of people within that country, to a membership list of a professional organization, or list of students enrolled in a school system (see also sampling (statistics) and survey sampling).|$|E

30|$|The paper {{starts from}} the {{observation}} that research on immigrants’ integration trajectories needs detailed information, both objective and attitudinal, and ideally longitudinal. This study uses <b>the</b> cases <b>of</b> Denmark and Sweden – whose registers produce detailed records about all natives’ and immigrants’ lives in their host countries – in order to, first, review existing research on immigrants and their integration and, second, discuss {{the way in which}} register data are used, their caveats and their potential. The study finds that, in Denmark and Sweden, registers provide systematic objective data which are fully available to researchers and have the potential to help in <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> high-quality subjective data. However, the population registers have some traits which may impact on <b>the</b> <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples.</b> <b>The</b> authors argue that, if researchers are aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caveats, registers can be used to obtain representative samples of immigrants, and register data can be complemented with survey-based attitudinal data, thus opening up new research opportunities for testing propositions on integration theories.|$|R
50|$|The {{sample is}} chosen from the {{sampling}} frame, {{which consists of}} {{a list of all}} members of the population of interest. The goal of a survey is not to describe the sample, but the larger population. This generalizing ability is dependent on the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample,</b> as stated above. Each member of the population is termed an element. There are frequent difficulties one encounters while choosing a representative sample. One common error that results is selection bias. Selection bias results when the procedures used to select a sample result in over representation or under representation of some significant aspect of the population. For instance, if the population of interest consists of 75% females, and 25% males, and the sample consists of 40% females and 60% males, females are under represented while males are overrepresented. In order to minimize selection biases, stratified random sampling is often used. This is when the population is divided into sub-populations called strata, and random samples are drawn from each of the strata, or elements are drawn for the sample on a proportional basis.|$|E
50|$|A single {{survey is}} made {{of at least a}} sample (or full {{population}} {{in the case of a}} census), a method of data collection (e.g., a questionnaire) and individual questions or items that become data that can be analyzed statistically.

The persons replying to a survey are called respondents, and depending on the questions asked their answers may represent themselves as individuals, their households, employers, or other organization they represent.|$|E
50|$|Missing data {{reduce the}} <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> and can {{therefore}} distort inferences about the population. If {{it is possible}} try {{to think about how}} to prevent data from missingness before the actual data gathering takes place. For example, in computer questionnaires it is often not possible to skip a question. A question has to be answered, otherwise one cannot continue to the next. So missing values due to the participant are eliminated by this type of questionnaire, though this method may not be permitted by an ethics board overseeing the research. And in survey research, it is common to make multiple efforts to contact each individual in the sample, often sending letters to attempt to persuade those who have decided not to participate to change their minds. However, such techniques can either help or hurt in terms of reducing the negative inferential effects of missing data, because {{the kind of people who}} are willing to be persuaded to participate after initially refusing or not being home are likely to be significantly different from the kinds of people who will still refuse or remain unreachable after additional effort.|$|E

30|$|The {{different}} <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> over total {{world trade}} {{does not necessarily}} imply a bias in {{the results of the}} econometric model, since the only factor it involves is that there are fewer observations of countries specialized in basic products; nevertheless, we believe they that they are sufficient and that the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> is high.|$|E

40|$|In {{working with}} <b>the</b> topics <b>of</b> racial {{discrimination}} and household energy reductions {{it is clear}} that just measuring attitudes is no longer sufficient.

30|$|To sum up, therefore, Danish and Swedish {{population}} registers fulfill several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditions initially {{set out for}} good data for integration research: they provide systematic, long-term objective data about the entire legally resident immigrant population, which is fully available to researchers (under certain conditions). Using registers as sampling frames provides researchers {{with the opportunity to}} collect subjective data. However, <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> these data for making inferences about the immigrant population largely depends on whether the <b>sample</b> extracted from <b>the</b> register is representative/probabilistic. As discussed above, there are several situations which are likely to affect <b>the</b> <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples.</b> Being aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential limitations <b>of</b> registers as sampling frames means that researchers are able to take measures to limit possible bias. Therefore, we encourage more research reporting on non-responses or contact problems in immigrant surveys, as this would be helpful for devising tailored solutions.|$|R

Using the same adjustment for all nations is likely sometimes incorrect because since the 1970s developing nations have seen higher increases than the developed world. <b>The</b> method <b>of</b> averaging neighboring countries for an estimation for the many nations that did not have measured IQs, while having a high correlation (0.92) with the measured results in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 32 nations that changed from the estimated to the measured categories between the two books, is likely problematic since some research indicates that absence of IQ tests indicates conditions such as poverty or war that may affect IQs.
