To {{compare the}} amount of protein {{deposits}} adhering to human-worn soft contact lenses, using the untreated contact lens from the contralateral eye as controls, to investigate {{the capabilities of the}} No <b>Rub</b> <b>contact</b> lens cleaning systems in protein removal from soft contact lenses. Methods. New 1 Day Acuvue soft contact lenses were worn on a daily-wear basis by 16 Hong Kong Chinese volunteers on 5 separate days. Four right lenses of each subject were treated with No <b>Rub</b> <b>contact</b> lens cleaning systems (Alcon Opti-Free Express, Alcon Opti-Free Express No Rub Lasting Comfort Formula, B&L ReNu MultiPlus, and Ciba Vision SOLO Care Plus). The total amount of protein was extracted from all contact lenses and analyzed by the Bradford assay. Results. Among the contralateral contact lenses, {{there was no significant difference}} in the total protein extracted (TPE; 11. 2 ± 3. 8 vs. 12. 6 ± 5. 2 mg/ml, p = 0. 20). There was a significant positive correlation in TPE between two lenses worn by the same volunteer (R 2 = 0. 84, y = 0. 79 x + 1. 3, p < 0. 001). Lenses treated with Opti-Free Express and Opti-Free Express No Rub Lasting Comfort Formula solutions had significantly less TPE (7. 3 ± 5. 2 and 6. 7 ± 4. 1 mg/ml, respectively, p < 0. 001) than the untreated contralateral lenses (12. 7 ± 6. 8 and 13. 2 ± 5. 3 mg/ml, respectively). No statistical difference in TPE was detected in the lenses treated with ReNu MultiPlus (13. 0 ± 7. 8 mg/ml, p = 0. 49) and Solo Care Plus (12. 1 ± 8. 7 mg/ml, p = 0. 99) solutions when compared with their untreated contralateral lenses (13. 0 ± 7. 8 and 12. 1 ± 8. 7 mg/ml, respectively).

40|$|International audienceThe {{difficulties}} {{associated with}} the rheological characterization of the "biological lubricants" to understand the remarkable tribological performances of biological <b>rubbing</b> <b>contacts,</b> have led to study their molecular composition especially that of molecular interfaces created with biological tissues. Recent studies [Trunfio 2008] have shown the importance of surfactant-type molecules (phospholipid-SAPL) on obtaining molecular surface layers with high mechanical strength and capable of locating the velocity accommodation, leading to a very low friction coefficient. These molecular layers are made of stacks of 3 to 7 SAPL bilayers [Hills 1989], with a thickness of about 5 nm each and separated by aqueous layers (a few nm thick, about 150 mM ion and pH around 7 in the healthy case). Low friction coefficients are due {{to the location of}} the velocity accommodation in the aqueous layers [Klein 2002] and it might be influenced by changes in ion concentrations or pH. This work aims to study the influence of these parameters on the evolution of friction and the degradation of SAPL bilayers during tests carried on an experimental realistic tribological model. This study therefore shows that good nano-mechanical resistance of the SAPL bilayers is essential to obtain low friction. It also suggests that low friction is ensured by ion hydration layers between adjacent SAPL bilayers and that a buffered medium is essential to maintain stable bilayers...|$|R

40|$|Many food {{products}} are highly structured, complex hydrocolloids that {{are characterized by}} either a gel-like or shear thinning behaviour and are thus strongly non-Newtonian systems. Their sensory perception during use is dependent on their behaviour in very thin film conditions at high shear rates. In order to better understand their behaviour in thin films, we have formulated two kinds of solution which are typically present in real systems. We examine the lubricating properties (i. e. tribology) of thin films of structured and non-structured fluids between a hard and soft surface (2 ̆ 7 soft-EHL 2 ̆ 7 lubrication), when the film thickness is of a similar size to the microstructural elements. The present work involves relating the tribology of both shear thinning polymer solutions and swollen microgel suspensions to their theological and microstructural properties in thin films and at high shear rates in the boundary, mixed and fluid film lubrication regimes. We show that the polymer solutions are typically entrained into <b>rubbing</b> <b>contacts</b> to form mixed fluid/boundary lubricating films while model yield stress fluids generate only boundary lubricating films. Soft-EHL theory satisfactorily predicts friction measurements at high entrainment speeds in full film lubrication. The microgels are found to form a confined film which minimizes contact between the surfaces, causing a lowering of the friction coefficient in the boundary-regime, while the friction in the mixed-regime is also dependent on the high-shear viscosity.

40|$|Oil-in-water (O/W) {{emulsions}} {{are widely}} used in metal rolling and cutting and also as fire-resistant hydraulic fluids. For both of these applications they require a reasonable degree of lubricating ability—in metal rolling to protect the surfaces against wear and seizure {{and to provide a}} controlled value of friction, and in hydraulics to limit the extent of wear, scuffing and fatigue of rubbing pump components. The lubricating properties of O/W emulsions are significantly poorer than those of most water-free oils and this deficiency can create service problems, such as excessive wear or rolling contact fatigue of hydraulic pumps or the uneven rolling or heat streaking of metal strip. Considerable work has gone into the design of O/W emulsions which have acceptable lubricating properties combined with satisfactory emulsion stability and corrosion resistance. Much of this work has been empirical, although there have also been a number of more fundamental studies of the film-forming and friction properties of emulsions.

40|$|Oral {{astringency}} is the dry sensation {{experienced in}} the mouth on consumption of plant-based polyphenols (catechins) found in wine and tea as well as certain fruits and vegetables. It is commonly explained as arising {{from the loss of}} lubricity owing to the precipitation of proteins from the salivary film that coats and lubricates the oral cavity. Here, we investigate this hypothesis directly by probing the impact of astringent compounds on the lubricating properties of saliva. By preadsorbing saliva onto an elastic hydrophobic substrate to form a highly lubricating and robust film under conditions designed to mimic the low pressure <b>rubbing</b> <b>contacts</b> {{experienced in the}} oral cavity (Bongaerts, Rossetti, & Stokes, 2007), we probe the interaction of this film on exposure to solutions containing tea catechins. We examine the response of the adsorbed salivary film to polyphenol structure, concentration and temperature, as well as the influence of astringency modulating solutions consisting of a thickener (maltodextrin) and milk. We find that a significant increase in friction coefficient occurs upon exposure with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) solutions due to a depletion of the lubricating proteins from the elastic substrates. The friction coefficient increases more rapidly with increasing EGCG concentration, this is in line with a corresponding increase in astringency perception. In addition, the inclusion of a hydrocolloid thickener in EGCG solutions caused a decrease in astringency perception probably due to specific EGCG-maltodextrin interaction and to an increase in viscosity, which lowers the friction coefficient between the elastic substrates. These findings show that the physical interaction of saliva proteins with EGCG molecules, which we probe through the loss of saliva lubricity, can be advantageously used to predict the astringent acuity of EGCG using our simple oral mimetic technique, supporting the hypothesis that astringency is related to a loss of lubrication. However, epicatechin (EC) did not alter the lubricating properties of the salivary film, although the EC solutions were perceived to be astringent, an observation which seems to question a simple causal dependence on oral lubrication. In addition to that, milk mitigated the astringency perception of EGCG solutions although considerably reducing saliva lubricity. We conclude that the depletion of saliva lubricating proteins is not necessary to obtain an astringent perception, and that astringency is unlikely to be a purely tactile percept...|$|R
