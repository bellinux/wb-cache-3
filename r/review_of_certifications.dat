Therefore, the current per-formance of certifying doctors was audited within a large teaching hospital entering the new century. Methods: A total of 1000 completed certificate counterfoils were examined retrospectively for appro-priateness of completion {{and the ability to}} construct a logical cause of death cascade. Results: Only 55 % of certificates were completed to a minimally accepted standard, and many of these failed to provide relevant information to allow adequate ICD- 10 coding.

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), a major environmental nongovernmental organization, has established stakeholder dialogues to formulate farm certification standards that promote ‘‘responsible’’ culture practices. As a preface to its ‘‘tilapia aquaculture dialogue,’’ the WWF for Nature commissioned a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> potential <b>certification</b> issues, later published as a peer-reviewed article. This article contends that both the review and the draft certification standards subsequently developed fail to adequately integrate critical factors governing the relative sustainability of tilapia production and thereby miss more significant issues related to resource-use efficiency and the appropriation of ecosystem space and services. This raises a distinct possibility that subsequent certification will promote intensive systems of tilapia production that are far less ecologically benign than existing widely practiced semiintensive alternatives.

40|$|AbstractHalal is {{accepted}} as a quality standard applied to product supply and manufacturing. The halal standard encompasses processed food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and medical products. In maintaining the halal standard, halal suppliers or manufacturers must abide to the halal quality regulation enforced by the public, semi-public and private regulatory bodies offering the halal certification. These regulatory bodies {{play an important role}} within the halal supply chain as their operational efficiency may affect the efficiency and the competitiveness of the halal industry. This paper reports the findings of a research work on the strategic approach towards halal quality management that addresses the operational efficiency of the halal food certification system using the Malaysian halal certification as a case study. This research argues that the efficiency <b>of</b> the halal <b>certification</b> is dependent on the organizational structure of the holistic system.

40|$|An {{investigation}} has been undertaken {{to ascertain the}} extent of the existing knowledge base regarding publically voluntary instruments capable of supporting organisations in developing improvements in environmental management. The multifaceted nature of the organisations seeking certification mean a generic approach to implementation is unlikely to deliver the desired after results or a resource efficient approach. Furthermore, the diversity of opinions recorded in the literature is often based on anecdotal evidence and small scale research projects. There is a lack of verifiable knowledge and understanding of the difficulties and barriers experienced by organisations attempting to secure certification for existing voluntary instruments for environmental management such as ISO 14001. The aim of the Research: ISO 14001 is the fastest growing of the ISO Standards related to Environmental Management Systems; however existing research has been small scale and anecdotal. This research aims to confirm or dispute the present discussions and assumptions surrounding the motivations and barriers to certification to ISO 14001. Through deductive reasoning this research will provide a comprehensive investigation into the barriers and motivations experienced in its implementation. It is proposed that more comprehensive opportunities for organisational categorisation may also be defined. The focus of the research has been to consider:  The potential for integration of these voluntary instruments.  The effects of the detailed requirements of the standard ISO 14001 on its certification and implementation processes.  The perceived and actual barriers to implementation  The opportunities to categorise participating organisations accordingly. An analysis of instruments available to support organisations in improving their environmental management has been undertaken. A complex and diverse array of instruments have been reviewed beyond the most regularly discussed ISO 14001. Considerable overlaps were identified in the requirements of the various instruments, suggesting opportunities for integration and resource efficiencies in implementation which have not previously been investigated. A detailed <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the <b>certification</b> processes <b>of</b> over 850 organisations certified to ISO 14001 was undertaken. This highlighted patterns in the barriers to implementation that have not previously been observed and which, in some cases, contradict existing literature. It has been shown that existing categorisation of originations was often only on the basis of whether an organisation was an SME or NON SME. However, it was proposed that this method lacked discrimination, with SME encompassing 99. 8 % of private sector businesses in the UK. This research has elicited significant motivations and barriers to EMS implementation and used these to provide an objective basis to categorise organisations. The outcome of this research has been:  A novel assessment of integration opportunities for 13 instruments.  An objective <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the <b>certification</b> and implementation processes for ISO 14001.  The development of taxonomies that encompasses multiple criteria that exhibit significant variability that could provide a method of classification for organisations...|$|R
40|$|The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant was {{licensed}} {{for disposal}} of transuranic wastes {{generated by the}} US Department of Energy. The facility consists of a repository mined in a bedded salt formation, approximately 650 m below the surface. Regulations promulgated by the US Environmental Protection Agency require that performance assessment calculations for the repository include the possibility that an exploratory drilling operation could penetrate the waste disposal areas {{at some time in}} the future. Release of contaminated solids could reach the surface during a drilling intrusion. One of the mechanisms for release, known as spallings, can occur if gas pressures in the repository exceed the hydrostatic pressure of a column of drilling mud.

40|$|In this research, I {{explore the}} {{emergence}} <b>of</b> environmental <b>certification</b> and labeling {{as a private}} market-driven instrument of global environmental governance and its implementation in local settings outside advanced industrial economies. I conceptualize the emergence of private regulation as an active institution-building that occurs at two levels. At the transnational level, formal substantive and procedural rules and organizational forms are constructed and legitimated. At the domestic level, the implementation of rules defined {{as a process of}} translation of transnational rules into on-the-ground practices occurs. Building on an extensive study <b>of</b> forest <b>certification</b> and labeling, I show that at the transnational level, institution-building is driven by problem-solving and conflict-settlement efforts of transnational actors embedded into a larger discursive context of neoliberal globalization and sustainable development. Furthermore, I show that at the domestic level, the implementation is not a straight-forward execution of transnational rules imposed by powerful transnational actors – e. g., international NGOs, multinationals or international organizations. Rather, local actors negotiate the ways in which transnational standards are implemented locally in both formal and informal settings, and thereby settle political conflicts over natural resource management and construct new knowledge (learning) related to standard implementation and good natural resource management. They use both global ideas reflected in transnational standards and locally available concepts and practices as building blocks, and combine them in various ways in order to construct new knowledge. I, therefore, emphasize stakeholder interest negotiation and collective learning as core social processes which enable the translation of transnational standards into on-the-ground practices. The research also evaluates the effectiveness <b>of</b> forest <b>certification</b> and labeling and argues that forest certification has had a positive but limited impact on corporate on-the-ground practices. I identify two factors that limit the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>certification</b> and labeling: national institutional and legal context and the market nature of private regulatory approaches.

40|$|Energy {{management}} and carbon accounting schemes {{are increasingly being}} adopted as a corporate response to climate change. These schemes often demand the setting of ambitious targets for the reduction of corporate greenhouse gas emissions. There is however only limited empirical insight in the companies’ target setting process and the auditing practice of certifying agencies that evaluate ambition levels of greenhouse gas reduction targets. We studied the target setting process of firms participating in the CO 2 Performance Ladder. The CO 2 Performance Ladder is a new certifiable scheme for energy {{management and}} carbon accounting that {{is used as a}} tool for green public procurement in the Netherlands. This study aimed at answering the question ‘to what extent does the current target setting process in the CO 2 Performance Ladder lead to ambitious CO 2 emission reduction goals?’. The research methods were interviews with relevant stakeholders (auditors, companies and consultants), document <b>reviews</b> <b>of</b> the <b>certification</b> scheme, and an analysis of corporate target levels for the reduction of CO 2 emissions. The research findings showed that several certification requirements for target setting for the reduction of CO 2 emissions were interpreted differently by the various actors and that the conformity checks by the auditors did not include a full assessment <b>of</b> all <b>certification</b> requirements.
