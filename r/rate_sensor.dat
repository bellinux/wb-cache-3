5|$|Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) was an American {{electronics}} company {{founded in}} Albuquerque, New Mexico that began manufacturing electronic calculators in 1971 and personal computers in 1975. Ed Roberts and Forrest Mims founded MITS in December 1969 to produce miniaturized telemetry modules for model rockets {{such as a}} roll <b>rate</b> <b>sensor.</b> In 1971, Roberts redirected the company into the electronic calculator market and the MITS 816 desktop calculator kit was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics. The calculators were very successful and sales topped one million dollars in 1973. A brutal calculator price war left the company deeply in debt by 1974.|$|E

25|$|The {{dissipation}} constant is {{a measure}} of the thermal connection of the thermistor to its surroundings. It is generally given for the thermistor in still air, and in well-stirred oil. Typical values for a small glass bead thermistor are 1.5mW/°C in still air and 6.0mW/°C in stirred oil. If the temperature of the environment is known beforehand, then a thermistor may be used to measure the value of the dissipation constant. For example, the thermistor may be used as a flow <b>rate</b> <b>sensor,</b> since the dissipation constant increases with the rate of flow of a fluid past the thermistor.|$|E
25|$|The fuel prevalves were deleted {{from the}} Mercury-Redstone in the {{interest}} of improved reliability, since if they closed during a launch, an abort condition could be triggered. On the three unmanned flights, it was discovered that the Mercury-Redstone exhibited a roll transient of 8° per second versus 4° for the Redstone missile. Although this was below the 12° per second roll transient required to trigger an abort, the roll <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> was removed from the two manned flights to reduce the chances of an accidental abort (the booster still retained the roll attitude angle sensor which would be triggered at 10°).|$|E
25|$|A pair of {{inertial}} sensors {{inside the}} controller, a three-axis linear accelerometer and a three-axis angular <b>rate</b> <b>sensor,</b> {{are used to}} track rotation as well as overall motion.

25|$|ESC {{is built}} {{on top of an}} {{anti-lock}} brake system, and all ESC-equipped vehicles are fitted with traction control. The ESC components include a yaw <b>rate</b> <b>sensor,</b> a lateral acceleration sensor, a steering wheel sensor, and an upgraded integrated control unit. In the US, Federal regulations require that ESC be installed as a standard feature on all passenger cars and light trucks as of the 2012 model year. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration research, ABS in 2005 cost an estimated US$368; ESC cost a further US$111. The retail price of ESC varies; as a stand-alone option it retails for as little as $250 USD. ESC was once rarely offered as a sole option, and was generally not available for aftermarket installation. Instead, it was frequently bundled with other features or more expensive trims, so the cost of a package that included ESC was several thousand dollars. Nonetheless, ESC is considered highly cost-effective and it might pay for itself in reduced insurance premiums.|$|E

40|$|A self {{contained}} sensor apparatus generates {{a signal that}} corresponds to {{at least two of}} the three orientational aspects of yaw, pitch and roll of a human-scale body, relative to an external reference frame. A sensor generates first sensor signals that correspond to rotational accelerations or rates of the body about certain body axes. The sensor may be mounted to the body. Coupled to the sensor is a signal processor for generating orientation signals relative to the external reference frame that correspond to the angular rate or acceleration signals.

The computer then commands the servo actuator to move the rudder that amount. The Dutch roll is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of yaw damper system installed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the effect of}} scintillation on the detection range of infrared <b>sensors,</b> where frame <b>rate</b> appears {{to play an important}} role. During EOPACE scintillation measurements were carried out over the Monterey and San Diego Bay. For this purpose 2 kinds of sources were used, either a source, modulated with 1000 Hz, or a DC searchlight source. The detector was a silicon detector with a narrow bandfilter around 0. 85 pm. The results show that scintillation is always present, even when locally the air to sea temperature difference (ASTD) is close to zero. This indicates that large ASTD variations may occur along the measurement path. The magnitude of the scintillation agrees reasonably well with the theory. This means a big advantage for high frame <b>rate</b> <b>sensors</b> in comparison with low frame <b>rate</b> <b>sensors</b> for detection of point targets at low elevatio...|$|R

40|$|In view of {{constantly}} growing {{market for}} micromechanical angular <b>rate</b> <b>sensors</b> Coriolis vibratory gyroscopes (CVGs) have received {{significant amount of}} attention from the MEMS sensors design specialists due to the promising possibility to fabricate sensitive elements of such gyroscopes in miniature form by using modern microelectronic mass-production technologies. While conventional angular rate measurement is based on detection of the rotation induced oscillations amplitude, trajectory analysis approaches are utilised as well. The latter also allows designing <b>rate</b> integrating <b>sensors,</b> which {{are more suitable for}} attitude and navigation applications. This paper addresses problems related to modelling angle of the sensitive element motion trajectory rotation due to the presence of the external angular rate. It is well known that in general case motion trajectory of the CVG sensitive element is an ellipse. Angle of the trajectory rotation in steady state is proportional to the angular rate. Major goal {{of this paper is to}} study dynamics of the sensitive element motion trajectory due to the external angular rate, and to develop its transient process mathematical model. Obtained model can be later used to improve performances of the Coriolis based angular <b>rate</b> <b>sensors.</b> Mathematical model of the CVG sensitive element motion trajectory angle of rotation has been developed in this paper. Accurate and approximate angle of rotation transfer functions were obtained and studied in terms of the transient process analysis. Performances of the developed models were demonstrated using numerical simulations. Developed model for the angle of trajectory rotation of a CVG sensitive element allow designing miniature angular <b>rate</b> <b>sensors</b> based on the trajectory analysis contrary to the conventional secondary amplitude detection. Derived transfer functions can be used to develop filtering and control systems that will improve its measurement performances. The latter is suggested as a topic for the future research. ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ???? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????????? ???????? ????????????? ????????????? ?????????. ???? ???????? ?????? ? ???????????? ???????????? ??????? ??? ????? ????, ??????? ???? ???????????? ??? ??????? ??????????????? ?????????? ?????????. ?????????????? ????????????? ??????? ???? ??????????? ??? ?????? ?????????? ?????????????...|$|R
