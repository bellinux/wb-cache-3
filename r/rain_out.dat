5|$|Much more {{is known}} of the {{hundreds}} of unique cleitean that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the <b>rain</b> <b>out.</b> They were used for storing peat, nets, grain, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact cleitean remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the front wall, which may date from the 7th century.|$|E
25|$|What {{is needed}} is a {{knowledge}} of the water content in the thunderstorm, the freezing level and the height of the summit of the precipitation. One way of calculating the water content is to transform the reflectivities in rain rate at all levels in the clouds and to sum it up. This is done by an algorithm called Vertically integrated liquid, or VIL. This value represent the total amount of liquid water in the cloud that is available. If the cloud would <b>rain</b> <b>out</b> completely, it would be the amount of rain falling on the ground and one can estimate with VIL the potential for flash flood.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} back to Coors Field {{to wrap up}} {{the month}} of August with a three-game series against the Rockies. The Dodgers bullpen imploded and they lost the opener 8–1. A <b>rain</b> <b>out</b> on August 30 forced the Dodgers and Rockies to play a day-night doubleheader the following day. In the opener, the Dodgers offense continued to struggle and they were routed again, 7–0. This {{was the first time}} the Rockies had shutout the Dodgers at home since August 27, 2012. In the second game, the Rockies scored five runs off of a shaky Bud Norris in the first inning but came back and won the game on a grand slam homer by Andrew Toles in the eighth inning, 10–8.|$|E

25|$|As {{anthropogenic}} {{greenhouse gas}} emissions reduce {{the stability of the}} global climate, abrupt climate change could become more intense. The impact of an asteroid or comet larger than about 1km diameter has the potential to block the sun globally, causing impact winter. Particles in the troposphere would quickly <b>rain</b> <b>out,</b> but particles in the stratosphere, especially sulfate, could remain there for years. Similarly, a supervolcanic eruption would reduce the potential of agricultural production from solar photosynthesis, causing volcanic winter. The Toba super volcanic eruption approximately 70,000 years ago may have nearly caused the extinction of humans (see Toba catastrophe theory). Again, primarily sulfate particles could block the sun for years. Solar blocking is not limited to natural causes as nuclear winter is also possible, which refers to the scenario involving widespread nuclear war and burning of cities that release soot into the stratosphere that would stay there for about 10 years. The high stratospheric temperatures produced by soot absorbing solar radiation would create near-global ozone hole conditions even for a regional nuclear conflict.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperatures}} on the illuminated side of the planet, and the likelihood that all surface volatiles have been depleted, silicate rock vaporization may have produced a tenuous atmosphere (with a pressure approaching 1 Pa or 10−2 mbar at 2500 K) consisting predominantly of sodium, O2, O and silicon monoxide, as well as smaller amounts of potassium and other metals. Magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) may <b>rain</b> <b>out</b> from such an atmosphere on the planet's daylight side {{in the form of}} particles of minerals, such as enstatite, corundum and spinel, wollastonite, silica, and iron (II) oxide, that would condense at altitudes below 10km. Titanium (Ti) may be depleted (and possibly iron similarly) by being transported towards the night side before condensing as perovskite and geikelite. Sodium (and to a lesser extent, potassium), being more volatile, would be less subject to condensation into clouds, and would dominate the outer layers of the atmosphere. Observations carried out with the UVES spectrograph on COROT-7b in and out of transit, searching for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosphere of the planet, failed to detect any significative feature. Spectral lines of calcium (Ca I, Ca II) and sodium (Na), expected for a Mercury-like planet, are either absent or below detection limits, and even emission lines expected from volcanic activity, due to tidal forces exerted by the gravity of the nearby star, were not found. The lack of detections is in agreement with the previously cited theoretical work, which points to a cloudless atmosphere made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure. From the data available, scientists can only infer that COROT-7b does not resemble any of the rocky planets of the Solar System.|$|E
25|$|The Blue Jays, {{still looking}} to clinch the division, {{travelled}} to Baltimore for a 4-game series. Behind 3–1 {{in the first}} game, Toronto rallied and tied {{the game in the}} eighth inning, before taking the lead in the ninth and holding on to win 4–3. The win lowered the team's magic number to 2. The second game of the series was rained out, and rescheduled for a doubleheader the following day. While the Blue Jays were idle due to the <b>rain</b> <b>out,</b> the Yankees lost to the Red Sox, and the magic number was lowered to 1. The Blue Jays would clinch the division by winning {{the first game of the}} doubleheader, 15–2. The starters were rested in the second game of the doubleheader, as well as in the final game of the series. Toronto lost both games, 8–1 and 6–4. Still in contention for the best record and home field advantage throughout the playoffs, the Blue Jays played their final three regular season games in Tampa Bay against the Rays. Troy Tulowitzki returned to the lineup in the first game of the series, recording 2 hits as Toronto defeated Tampa 8–4. Roberto Osuna would take the blown save and loss in the second game, as the Rays rallied in the ninth inning to win 4–3. Mark Buehrle was given the start in the final game of the season, despite having started just two days prior, and entered the game just 2 innings short of reaching 200 for the 15th consecutive season. Unfortunately, Buehrle was not able to get out of the first inning, ending his streak as the Jays lost the game 12–3. The loss ensured that Kansas City would finish with the best record in the American League, and that the Blue Jays would play the Texas Rangers in the American League Division Series.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers began a roadtrip at PNC Park on June 14 but the woes {{continued}} as Jeff Locke tossed seven shutout innings and the Pittsburgh Pirates won 3-0. The next day, Kershaw allowed only one run and three hits in seven innings, while striking out eight. However, the bullpen coughed up the lead yet again. This time the Dodgers {{managed to pull}} out the win 5-3 in 11 innings. A three-run home run by Pedro Álvarez off Greinke was the key to the Pirates' 6-3 win in the series finale. The Dodgers were scheduled to begin a two-game series against the New York Yankees on June 18, but a <b>rain</b> <b>out</b> forced the two teams to play a day-night doubleheader on June 19. Hanley Ramírez had four hits, including a two-run homer in the first game, but the Dodgers committed four errors in the game and lost 6-4. Chris Capuano came off the disabled list to pitch six shutout innings and Puig hit a home run to lead the Dodgers to a split of the doubleheader with a 6-0 win. Puig had 27 hits in his first 15 games, second most all-time. After the game, they took a cross-country plane ride and opened a series against the Padres in San Diego. They lost 6-3 as the Padres defenders made several highlight reel plays and Pedro Ciriaco had an RBI triple and a two-run home run in the game. The Dodgers committed two more errors the next day, tying the Houston Astros for the league lead. They lost 5-2. Zack Greinke had his best start as a Dodger on June 22, holding the Padres to one run and four hits, while striking out eight in eight innings. Adrian Gonzalez and Haney Ramirez homered in the 6-1 victory. Gonzalez and Ramirez hit back-to-back homers the following day to help the Dodgers split the series 3-1.|$|E
500|$|Each ten foot {{diameter}} balloon {{was filled}} with one-third oxygen and two-thirds hydrogen. To do this, the empty balloon was {{spread out on the}} ground with plenty of room around it. It was then attached to a hose to start filling with oxygen gas. The other end of the hose went to a retort that {{was filled with}} chlorinate of potassium and a small amount of manganese oxide. The retort was heated to a high temperature through a gasoline burner. Oxygen gas, generated at 600 cubic feet per hour, went through a lime-water wash and from there to fill the balloon. The balloon was filled up one third of the way. The hose was then connected to the hydrogen gas generator and filled up the remaining two-thirds of the way. The oxygen and hydrogen balloon was referred to as an [...] "oxy-hydrogen" [...] balloon. Each gas had an electric fuse detonator inside, which made it a type of [...] "bomb" [...] when triggered electrically. Wires were used that led from the ground to the balloon and when an electrical charge was made by a dynamo, it passed through the wires to set off the detonator causing an explosion that was brighter than the sun. This caused the oxygen and hydrogen to react, creating water (H2O). This man-made water then acted as a nucleus for making <b>rain</b> <b>out</b> of the atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "" [...] ("He [...] {{causes the}} wind to blow and the rain to fall") is {{inserted}} in the second benediction of the Amidah, known as גבורות (Powers), throughout the rainy {{half of the year}} ( [...] , yemot hageshamim, i.e., between Sukkot and Passover). The most prominent of God's powers mentioned in this benediction is the resurrection of the dead. Rain is mentioned here because God's provision of rain is considered to be as great a manifestation of His power as the resurrection of the dead. [...] At the same time, because <b>rain</b> <b>out</b> of season can be more harmful than helpful, Jewish tradition strongly avoids any hint of invoking rain outside the rainy season.|$|E
