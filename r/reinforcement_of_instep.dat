40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} gaining relevant knowledge about important differences with respect to compare accuracy <b>of</b> <b>instep</b> kicking between preferred and non-preferred leg depending on the different intensity (optimal and maximal) in a resting state, and {{in a state of}} fatigue. The sample included 20 respondents whose characteristics were age (yrs) 16. 7 ± 0. 47, height (cm) 178. 91 ± 4. 26, and body weight (kg) 71. 52 ± 5. 13. The sample of variables contained eight measures that defined accuracy <b>of</b> <b>instep</b> kicking by preferred and non-preferred leg in various occasions: with optimal and maximal intensities and in a resting state and a state of fatigue respectively. The results of the measuring were analyzed by means of a statistical procedure labeled a significance test of two arithmetic means conducted on independent samples or popularly known a t-test. In comparison of accuracy between preferred and non-preferred leg in a resting state with optimal and maximal intensity, as it was expected there were significant differences as well as in a state of fatigue with optimal intensity, all in favor of preferred leg. While the football instep kicking significant differences between preferred and non-preferred leg in a state of fatigue with maximal intensity were not noticable. The current findings clearly demonstrated that the young football players have much more uniformed legs at the expense of accuracy when fatigued and kick the ball with the maximal intensity. It means a state of fatigue can affect the tested accuracy <b>of</b> <b>instep</b> kicking with the maximal intensity...|$|R

Forty-five fifth grade boys and girls from a local elementary school were used for the study. It was a pre-test, post-test repeated measure design, and treatment consisted of 5 days of practice. Prior to each day's practice attempts, the subjects were given a demonstration of a different aspect <b>of</b> the <b>instep</b> dive. Two variables, accuracy and velocity, were measured to determine the quality <b>of</b> the <b>instep</b> drive. The results of the study showed that both practice order groups lowered their accuracy and velocity scores.

In Experiment II, <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> specific alternative behavior during extinction and differential <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> other behavior were used in two components, while one component continued to provide reinforcement for the original response. Once again, the alternative-response procedure was most effective in reducing responding {{as long as it}} remained in effect.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>instep</b> and side-foot kicks for female and male soccer players to understand the common and different mechanics underlying the two kicks. 6 female and 6 male soccer players performed maximal instep and side-foot kicks. Their motions and ground reaction forces were recorded by a motion capture system (250 Hz) and a force platform (1000 Hz). The ball velocity <b>of</b> the <b>instep</b> kick (22. 5 ± 1. 0 m/s for female players, 27. 9 ± 1. 3 m/s for male players) was significantly higher than that of the side-foot kick (21. 5 ± 1. 0 m/s for female players, 26. 9 ± 1. 3 m/s for male players). Significant differences were also observed between the two kicks of female players for the value of hip flexion/extension torque. Moreover, significant differences were also observed between the female and male players for the value of hip adduction/abduction torque for side-foot kick. These results indicated that to enhance such hip torques is one of the technical elements that could be improved to increase ball velocity of side-foot kick in female players...|$|R
