5|$|Cape Moreton Light, also {{listed as}} North Point Range <b>Rear</b> <b>Light,</b> is an heritage-listed active {{lighthouse}} located on Cape Moreton, a rocky headland {{located at the}} north eastern tip of Moreton Island, a large sand island {{on the eastern side}} of Moreton Bay, on the coast of South East Queensland, Australia. It marks the northern entrance to Moreton Bay and Brisbane and also serves as the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> for the North Point Range. With its two distinctive red bands, it also serves as a daymark. It is the oldest lighthouse in Queensland, and the only one to be built by the New South Wales Government before the separation of Queensland, which took place in 1859. It is also the only lighthouse in Queensland to be built of stone.|$|E

25|$|For 2012 the V70 and XC70 {{received}} a minor facelift. The front {{received a}} redesigned bumper with chrome accents, the Volvo logo {{on the front}} grill was enlarged. The indicators in the side mirrors were redesigned and changed to LED and the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> cluster redesigned. New optional alloy wheels and exterior paint options were added.|$|E
25|$|Externally, {{the most}} obvious changes over the SII were the thicker and more {{incorporated}} rubber bumpers with decorative chrome only on the top edge, flush door handles for increased safety, a one-piece front door glass without a separate 1/4 light, a grille with only vertical vanes, reverse lights moved from the boot plinth to the larger <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> clusters and a revised roofline with narrower door frames and increased glass area.|$|E
25|$|The RX {{was built}} on a unibody chassis. Its {{exterior}} design was not typical of existing four-door vehicles at its introduction. Among design features, the vehicle featured front triangular quarter-windows, door-mounted side mirrors, a rear liftgate with top-mounted spoiler, and translucent front and <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> covers with round lenses. The exterior color scheme was two-tone, with the bumper and lower body-side cladding a gray color. The RX 300 carried a drag coefficient of 0.36 C'd. The first-generation Lexus RX was built in Kyushu, Japan.|$|E

50|$|The Liston <b>Rear</b> Range <b>Light</b> {{was one of}} four lights {{forming a}} complex known as Liston's Tree Range. One set of two lights was located in New Jersey, forming the Finn's Point Range Lights, with the other pair in Delaware became the Port Penn Range Lights. The front lights were placed in low wood-framed structures, while the <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> were {{designed}} as tall, skeletal wrought iron towers. Both <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> were substantially similar, except that the <b>rear</b> Port Penn <b>light</b> was 30 ft higher.|$|R
25|$|Many jurisdictions {{require the}} use of a {{headlight}} and a <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> or reflector after dark. Most European countries and some US states require front and rear lights at night, while others allow reflectors only at the rear. Some jurisdictions impose requirements on light output and the size of lamp and reflector lenses; some require compliance with standards defined by third parties; some simply stipulate a minimum distance from which any lighting device should be visible. In some jurisdictions such as Germany and the Netherlands, flashing red tail lights are illegal, in others they are allowed.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 the car gained <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> {{units from}} the Citroën Ami 6, and also {{standardised}} a third side {{window in the}} rear pillar on 2CV6 (602cc) models. From 1970, only two series were produced: the 2CV 4 (AZKB) with 435 cc and the 2CV 6 (Azka) with 602 cc displacement. All 2CVs from this date can run on unleaded fuel. 1970s cars featured rectangular headlights, except the Spécial model. In 1971 the front bench seat was replaced with two individual seats. In 1972 2CVs were fitted with standard three-point seat belts. In 1973 new seat covers, a padded single-spoke steering wheel and ashtrays were introduced.|$|E
25|$|Bull {{was killed}} {{on the night of}} Sunday, 28 May 1939, when the car he was {{passenger}} in rammed into the rear of a stationary lorry. Bull was playing in the Worcestershire-Essex county match at the time, but Sunday was a rest day. He had spent the day playing golf and was returning to the hotel with four fellow players. William Joseph Bone, the driver, was blinded by the light of a car travelling in the opposite direction. The lorry had its <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> damaged. Its driver, Hyman Bunner, was underneath the lorry repairing it when the car hit it at around 45 miles per hour. Both drivers were exonerated of any blame.|$|E

25|$|There are {{distinguishable}} {{differences between}} the EMD models and the Canadian GMD-built models. Most notable are the headlight configurations. The biggest giveaway is the <b>rear</b> <b>light.</b> GMD SD40-2s have a single beam, where EMD has twin-beam styled lights, usually placed next to each other. GMD models also have lights mounted on the nose, and EMD is above the cab between the numberboards. Some EMD variations have a nose headlight, although the headlight style and placement usually isn't the same as seen on the GMDs. Other features on the GMD models include the bell mounted above the cab between the numbers, triple-style classification lights above the numbers(since trains don't use classlights anymore, many locomotives have had them removed), and no numberboards on the back.|$|E
25|$|A {{facelift}} in July 1976 saw the four-door saloon {{replaced with}} a five-door hatchback. Peugeot had been afraid that a five-door 104 would steal sales from the old-fashioned 204 Break, but with production of the 204 {{coming to an end}} in July 1976 this was no longer a concern. <b>Rear</b> <b>light</b> clusters were modified slightly with indicators that wrapped around to the sides of the car, and a 1.1-litre engine was also made available. The coupé was made available in two versions, the ZL and also the more powerful ZS with 66PS. A modified camshaft on the 954cc engines also retarded the valve timing in order to favour fuel economy at the price of a slight power reduction. The revised models only appeared in right-hand drive form {{at the end of the}} year. 1977 proved to be the most successful year for the 104, with 190,000 being built.|$|E

Very early {{versions of}} these Series 2 cars were fitted with Series I bodyshells {{with a separate}} spare wheel-hatch and smaller <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> and aluminium bonnet and doors. Later versions have all-steel bodyshells, no spare wheel hatch, and larger <b>rear</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R

The current characteristic is three white flashes every 15 seconds (Fl.(3)W.15s). It also shows a fixed blue light (F.Bu.) {{which serves as}} a <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> for the North Channel Range Front Light at -131° (NGA 5945, Admiralty K2822, showing Iso.Bu.2s).|$|E
2500|$|This {{facelift}} incorporated smaller headlights, a new grille and <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> clusters {{that included}} reversing lights. The amount of chrome trim was reduced and generally replaced by black plastic. At {{the end of}} summer, the ZS coupé variant was given an [...] 1,360cc engine to improve its performance. The existing 72PS version remained on sale {{at a lower price}} until the 1984 model year was introduced. The power gain was achieved by using two carburetors rather than one double-barrel unit.|$|E

2500|$|The coupé {{gained a}} third (cheaper) {{commercial}} variant {{with only two}} seats, the ZA, and all coupé variants were given larger <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> clusters with integral reversing lights.

2500|$|Several prototypes {{based on}} the 104 are known to exist. Different power sources were tried out, {{including}} electric and diesel. The M18 prototype (circa 1976) was a blue 5-door estate, with <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> clusters {{similar to those that}} were used on the 504 estate. The M23 was a dark red 3-door van concept {{based on the}} saloon rather than the existing 3-door coupé.

2500|$|The new-generation AU Falcon was {{released}} in 1998 with its range comprising the following models: Forté (previously GLi), S, Futura, Fairmont, Fairmont Ghia, XR6, XR6 VCT and XR8. External model differentiation was achieved via the use of different grilles and bonnets (low bonnet and vertical [...] "waterfall" [...] grille on Forté, horizontal single bar on Futura, integrated quad-lamp bumper bar and grille on the XR sports range; high bonnet and large grille on Fairmont range) and more basic fittings such as different alloy wheel design, <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> clusters (clear turn signals on Fairmont), body colour-coordination and chrome fittings.|$|E
