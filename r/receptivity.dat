5|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} {{between the ages}} of 18 and 24 months in females, and can be reached by 17 months in males. It is polyestrous, having many periods of sexual <b>receptivity</b> during a year. In captivity however, there is a clear birth peak between March and May. It has been observed that reproductive patterns of captive prosimians in the northern hemisphere are altered. The estrus cycle lasts 29–45 days, with most copulations occurring on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The New South Wales waratah {{had been}} {{considered}} to be protandrous (that is, with male parts concluding sexual activity before female parts become receptive on the same plant), but analysis of the timing of pollen viability and stigma <b>receptivity</b> has shown significant overlaps. The species {{has been shown to}} be self-incompatible, requiring cross-pollination with plants of other genotypes to reproduce successfully.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, {{studies have shown}} that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of <b>receptivity,</b> but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E
5|$|Since cone cells make {{color vision}} possible, the high {{prevalence}} of rod cells in lemur eyes suggest {{they have not}} evolved color vision. The most studied lemur, the ring-tailed lemur, {{has been shown to}} have blue-yellow vision, but lacks the ability to distinguish red and green hues. Due to polymorphism in opsin genes, which code for color <b>receptivity,</b> trichromatic vision may rarely occur in females of a few lemur species, such as Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) and the red ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra). Most lemurs, therefore, are either monochromats or dichromats.|$|E
5|$|Mating in {{hartebeest}} {{takes place}} throughout the year, {{with one or}} two peaks that can be influenced by the availability of food. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Reproduction varies by the subspecies and local factors. Mating takes place in the territories defended by a single male, mostly in open areas. The males may fight fiercely for dominance, following which the dominant male smells the female's genitalia, and follows her if she is in oestrus. Sometimes a female in oestrus holds out her tail slightly to signal her <b>receptivity,</b> and the male tries to block the female's way. She may eventually stand still and allow the male to mount her. Copulation is brief and is often repeated, sometimes twice or more in a minute. Any intruder at this time is chased away. In large herds, females often mate with several males.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place {{throughout}} the year; peaks occur during {{spring and fall}} in Texas. Two peaks have been observed in India: from August to October and from March to April. Rutting males aggressively establish and defend their territories from other males, giving out loud grunts and engaging in serious head-to-head fights, pushing each other using horns. Aggressive display consists of thrusting the neck forward and raising it, folding the ears and raising the tail. The dominant male pursues the female with his nose pointing upward, smells her urine and shows a flehmen response. The female shows her <b>receptivity</b> by waving her tail and thumping the hindlegs on the ground. This is followed by several mounting attempts, and copulation. The whole process may {{last as long as}} six hours. The female will remain still for some time after copulation, following which she may start grazing. The male may then move on to mate with another female.|$|E
25|$|Arms and hands: To show <b>receptivity,</b> negotiators should spread {{arms and}} open hands on table or relaxed on their lap. Negotiators show poor <b>receptivity</b> when their hands are clenched, crossed, {{positioned}} {{in front of}} their mouth, or rubbing the back of their neck.|$|E

25|$|Although {{not found}} in all organisms, {{researchers}} have identified sexual intercourse patterns in certain animals that reflect extended female sexuality, such as in some old world primates, birds and insects. Extensive {{research has focused on}} analysing the musk shrew's rate of sexual behaviour. The only period that is associated with a drop in female <b>receptivity</b> to copulation is during mid to late pregnancy; yet, even at this time, occasional mating is reported. Therefore, researchers have concluded that this animal has similar sexual <b>receptivity</b> across infertile and fertile phases. Within primates, research has consistently found evidence of extended female sexuality in the rhesus monkey and chimpanzees. Both of these primates mate at all stages of the ovarian cycle, with only slight increases in sexual <b>receptivity</b> during fertile stages, and decreases during menstruation.|$|E
25|$|Regulates {{the stereotypical}} sexual <b>receptivity</b> behavior; this {{lordosis}} behavior is estrogen-dependent, which is {{regulated by the}} ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent survey}} by Pratham rated the <b>receptivity</b> of Bihari {{children}} to their teaching as being better than those in other states.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, a male rat {{castrated}} {{just after}} birth will be feminized, and the adult will show female sexual behavior {{in response to}} estrogen (sexual <b>receptivity,</b> lordosis behavior).|$|E
25|$|In 2016, a study {{report the}} {{existence}} of REM- and NREM-like sleep stages in the Australian dragon Pogona vitticeps. Amphibians have periods of inactivity but show high vigilance (<b>receptivity</b> to potentially threatening stimuli) in this state.|$|E
25|$|According to Crocker, an {{important}} Buddhist element of Gestalt {{is that a}} “person is simply allowing what-is in the present moment to reveal itself to him {{and out of that}} <b>receptivity</b> is responding with ‘no-mind’”.|$|E
25|$|Promotes sexual <b>receptivity</b> in estrus, and induces {{lordosis}} behavior. In non-human mammals, it also induces estrus (in heat) {{prior to}} ovulation, which also induces lordosis behavior. Female non-human mammals are not sexually receptive without the estrogen surge, i.e., {{they have no}} mating desire when not in estrus.|$|E
25|$|Female {{cuttlefish}} signal their <b>receptivity</b> to mating using {{a display}} called Precopulatory Grey. Male cuttlefish sometimes use deception toward guarding males {{to mate with}} females. Small males hide their sexually dimorphic fourth arms, change their skin pattern to the mottled appearance of females, and change the shape of their arms to mimic those of non-receptive, egg-laying females.|$|E
25|$|The low {{occurrence}} of social monogamy in placental mammals has been {{claimed to be}} related to the presence or absence of estrus—or oestrus—the duration of sexual <b>receptivity</b> of a female. This, however, doesn't explain why estrus females generally mate with any proximate male nor any correlation between sexual and social monogamy. Birds, which are notable for a high incidence of social monogamy, do not have estrus.|$|E
25|$|Nel Noddings' {{approach}} to ethics of care {{has been described}} as relational ethics because it prioritizes concern for relationships. Like Carol Gilligan, Noddings accepts that justice based approaches, which are supposed to be more masculine, are genuine alternatives to ethics of care. However, unlike Gilligan, Noddings' believes that caring, 'rooted in <b>receptivity,</b> relatedness, and responsiveness' is a more basic and preferable {{approach to}} ethics (Caring 1984, 2).|$|E
25|$|Thus {{religious}} {{truth is}} seen to be relative to its recipients and not absolute; while the messengers proclaimed eternal moral and spiritual truths that are renewed by each messenger, they also changed their message to reflect the particular spiritual and material evolution of humanity {{at the time of}} the appearance of the messenger. In the Bahá'í view, since humanity's spiritual capacity and <b>receptivity</b> has increased over time, the extant to which these spiritual truths are expounded changes.|$|E
25|$|Human {{females are}} {{considered}} to exhibit the greatest degree of extended female sexuality, with <b>receptivity</b> to sexual intercourse remaining constant across fertile and infertile phases of the reproductive cycle, including during pregnancy, lactation, and in adolescence. In a study of 20,000 women from 13 countries, frequency of copulation was reportedly the same across all stages of the ovarian cycle. The only notable drop in sexual behaviour occurred during menstruation. Therefore, women largely showed {{the same level of}} sexual behaviour in the non-fertile phases of their ovarian cycles as in the fertile phases.|$|E
25|$|In {{his third}} book, Why is Sex Fun?, also {{published}} in 1997, Diamond discusses evolutionary factors underlying features {{of human sexuality}} that are generally taken for granted but that are highly unusual among our animal relatives. Those features include a long-term pair relationship (marriage), coexistence of economically cooperating pairs within a shared communal territory, provision of parental care by fathers {{as well as by}} mothers, having sex in private rather than in public, concealed ovulation, female sexual <b>receptivity</b> encompassing most of the menstrual cycle (including days of infertility), female but not male menopause, and distinctive secondary sexual characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Some animals opportunistically {{mate with}} {{individuals}} of another species. This is more commonly observed in domesticated species and animals in captivity, possibly because captivity {{is associated with}} a decrease in aggression and an increase in sexual <b>receptivity.</b> Nevertheless, animals in the wild have been observed to attempt sexual activity with other species. It is mostly documented among species that belong to the same genus, but sometimes occurs between species of distant taxa. Alfred Kinsey cites reports of sexual activity involving a female eland with an ostrich, a male dog with a chicken, a male monkey with a snake, and a female chimpanzee with a cat.|$|E
25|$|Research {{is fairly}} {{consistent}} in {{the finding that}} species with concealed estrus mate at all stages of their ovarian cycle. For instance, mating activity in assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) has been investigated. The researchers analysed the levels of progesterone in the monkeys, {{in order to establish}} the ovarian stage of the female, as progesterone peaks following the fertile window. They found that the females concealed estrus and were sexually receptive during the entire mating season. Concealed estrus and sexual <b>receptivity</b> (at all times of the ovarian cycle) aids paternity confusion. This is because the males are unsure of who mated with the female during her fertile period, and so do not know the identity of the father.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{were developed}} to prevent ovulation by suppressing the release of gonadotropins. They inhibit follicular development and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.COCs prevent fertilization and, therefore, qualify as contraceptives. There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen.Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial <b>receptivity</b> to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.|$|E
25|$|To be sure, his reforms {{could not}} {{and did not}} achieve {{everything}} overnight. The spread of Theravada Buddhism in Upper Burma was gradual; it took over three centuries. Its monastic system did not achieve widespread village level penetration in more remote areas until as late as 19th century. Nor did the Aris die out. Their descendants, known as forest dwelling monks, remained a powerful force patronized by the royalty down to the Ava period in the 16th century. Likewise, the nat worship continued (down to the present day). Even the Theravada Buddhism of Anawrahta, Kyansittha and Manuha was one still strongly influenced by Hinduism when compared to later more orthodox (18th and 19th century) standards. Tantric, Saivite, and Vaishnava elements enjoyed greater elite influence than they would later do, reflecting both the relative immaturity of early Burmese literacy culture and its indiscriminate <b>receptivity</b> to non-Burman traditions. Indeed, even today's Burmese Buddhism contains many animist, Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu elements.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} case, {{according}} to FCC, evolving females with increasingly heavy childcare burdens {{would have done}} best by resisting attempts at harem-holding by locally dominant males. No human female needs a partner who will get her pregnant only to disappear, abandoning her in favour of his next sexual partner. To any local group of females, the more such philandering can be successfully resisted—and the greater the proportion of previously excluded males who can {{be included in the}} breeding system and persuaded to invest effort—the better. By evolving concealed ovulation and continuous <b>receptivity,</b> females force males into longer periods of consortship if they are to {{have a good chance of}} achieving impregnation (figures c,d). Reproductive synchrony —whether seasonal, lunar or a combination of the two—is a key strategy for reproductive levelling, reducing paternity skew and involving more males in investment in offspring. Greater reproductive synchrony owing to seasonality during glacial cycles may have differentiated Neanderthal reproductive strategies from those of Homo sapiens ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Important {{aspects of}} {{courtship}} displays include male alert posture, approach and pursuit, the marking of the substrate trail, and tail undulations. Once a male has {{the attention of}} the female, he may release pheromones, which are used for individual recognition, mate recognition, and mate choice decisions, and generally increase female <b>receptivity</b> towards the male’s spermatophore and improve his chances of reproductive success with her. In the red-legged salamander (Plethodon shermani), males directly apply pheromones onto the female's nares. In the aquatic smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), the pheromones are delivered indirectly; the male wafts them towards the female with his tail. In some species, {{it has been shown that}} the size a larger, more elaborate male’s tail has played a role in the female’s decision to mate. In the newt species of the Italian crested newt (Triturus carnifex), males that possessed large mid-dorsal body crests were more favorable to the females looking to mate.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman Empire had {{a social}} {{system based on}} {{religious}} affiliation. The religious insignia extended to every social function. It was common to wear clothing that identified the person with their own particular religious grouping and accompanied headgear which distinguished rank and profession throughout the Ottoman Empire. The turbans, fezes, bonnets and head-dresses surmounting Ottoman styles showed the sex, rank, and profession (both civil and military) of the wearer. These styles were accompanied with a strict regulation beginning with the reign of Süleyman the Magnificent. Sultan Mahmud II followed on the example of Peter the Great in Russia in modernizing the Empire and used the dress code of 1826 which developed the symbols (classifications) of feudalism among the public. These reforms like that of Peter I of Russia or Sultan Mahmud II, was achieved through introduction of the progressive customs by decrees, while banning the traditional customs. The view of their social change proposed; if the permanence of secularism was to be assured by removal of persistence of traditional cultural values (the religious insignia), a considerable degree of cultural <b>receptivity</b> by the public to the further social change could be achieved. The dress code gave {{a chance for the}} removal of persistence of traditional values in the society.|$|E
25|$|Bhagwan Gopinath is {{not known}} to have made any formal disciples {{although}} {{he is said to}} have spiritually initiated a few seekers that would come to him seeking his spiritual tutelage. His method of initiation involved sharing his pipe or by transfixing his gaze on them (called drishtipat). He would rarely initiate anyone by word of mouth although that {{is believed to be the}} commonly invoked method of initiation in Hinduism. He is known to have guided seekers based on their spiritual aptitude and <b>receptivity</b> in worshipping either saguna Brahman (God with form) or nirguna Brahman (God without form) and sometimes also help them choose their ideal of worship or veer them towards worshipping guru as Parabrahma (the ultimate reality). Though he would recommend saguna upasana for the beginners, he would eventually veer them towards nirguna upasana. Once in response to a question by his devotee as to whether saints should render help to people in spiritual and temporal spheres, he is known to have remarked that unlike a muscular animal who can easily swim across the river, a small insect would drown without help so they have to be helped. As such, his devotees gave him the epithet Jagadguru (spiritual guide of humanity).|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} of the Banksia flower, with the style end functioning as a pollen presenter, suggests that autogamous self-fertilisation must be common. In many Banksia species, the risk of this occurring is reduced by protandry: a delay in a flower's <b>receptivity</b> to pollen until after its own pollen has lost its viability. There is dispute, however, over whether this occurs in B.prionotes: one study claimed to have confirmed [...] "protandrous development", yet recorded high levels of stigmatic <b>receptivity</b> immediately after anthesis, and long pollen viability, observations that are not consistent with protandry.|$|E
500|$|The {{breeding}} season runs from mid-April to mid-May. Estrus lasts 4 to 6hours, and females mate with multiple males during this period. [...] Within a troop, females stagger their <b>receptivity</b> {{so that each}} female comes into season on a different day during the {{breeding season}}, reducing competition for male attention. Gestation lasts for about 135days, and parturition occurs in September or occasionally October. In the wild, one offspring is the norm, although twins may occur. Ring-tailed lemur infants have a birth weight of [...] and are carried ventrally (on the chest) for the first 1 to 2weeks, then dorsally (on the back).|$|E
500|$|The Graeco-Roman anatomist Galen (AD 129–210) named seven {{pairs of}} cranial nerves. Much later, in 1664, English anatomist Sir Thomas Willis {{suggested}} that there were actually 9 pairs of nerves. [...] Finally, in 1778, German anatomist Samuel Soemmering named the 12 pairs of nerves that are generally accepted today. However, {{because many of the}} nerves emerge from the brain stem as rootlets, there is continual debate as to how many nerves there actually are, and how they should be grouped. There is reason to consider both the olfactory (I) and Optic (II) nerves to be brain tracts, rather than cranial nerves. Further, the very small terminal nerve (nerve N or O) exists in humans but may not be functional. In other animals, it appears to be important to sexual <b>receptivity</b> based on perceptions of phermones ...|$|E
500|$|The {{mating system}} is {{described}} as multi-male and multi-female. [...] Males establish dominance hierarchies prior to the mating season, however, some studies in the wild have shown no male aggression or visible competition for receptive females. [...] Males in captivity become highly aggressive and form strict dominance hierarchies. These captive males may show the highest plasma testosterone levels found in mammals, and even the odor of a dominant male can lower the testosterone levels and sexually inhibit a subordinate male. [...] During the breeding season, male testes increase significantly in size, facilitating sperm competition due to female promiscuity. [...] Studies with the gray mouse lemur {{have shown that the}} optimal insemination period, during which a male is most likely to sire offspring, occurs early during a female's <b>receptivity.</b> [...] Only during the mating season does male mortality rise above that of female mortality.|$|E
500|$|The band {{recorded}} some radio {{sessions for}} the John Peel's Top Gear radio show on BBC, but otherwise, England in general {{was not their}} priority. Those recordings recently resurfaced and {{are included in the}} compilation album BBC Sessions 1968–1970. Shades of Deep Purple was finally released in the United Kingdom with much simpler cover art in September 1968 and went almost unnoticed there. Jon Lord, {{in an interview with the}} magazine Beat Instrumental, reflected on the scarce <b>receptivity</b> of England to his group and on how lucky the band was to be signed to an American label that gave Deep Purple [...] "far greater freedom both financially and artistically" [...] than they [...] "could ever have got with a British company", which [...] "as a rule won't spend any time or effort with you until you're an established name".|$|E
500|$|Later the Bennets are {{visited by}} Mr. Collins, a pompous clergyman who talks of little but his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. After {{learning}} from Mrs. Bennet that Jane {{is expected to}} become engaged soon, Collins decides to pursue Elizabeth, utterly oblivious to her lack of <b>receptivity</b> towards himself. Meanwhile, the easy-going and charming Lieutenant Wickham of the newly-arrived militia captures the girls' attention; he wins Elizabeth's sympathy by telling her that Darcy had cheated him of his inheritance. At a ball at Netherfield, Elizabeth, startled by Darcy's abrupt appearance and request, accepts a dance with him before realizing it, but vows to her best friend Charlotte Lucas that she has [...] "sworn to loathe him for all eternity". During the dance, she attacks him with witty sarcasm and Darcy responds in kind. At the same ball, Charlotte expresses concern to Elizabeth that Jane's behaviour towards Mr. Bingley is too reserved, and that Bingley may not realise that she loves him.|$|E
