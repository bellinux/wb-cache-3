2500|$|The {{committee}} {{investigating the}} crash were {{satisfied that the}} destructive error in 1989 was not relevant to the 1994 crash. Information provided from Boeing to the investigation led to the following conclusion regarding FADEC performance: [...] "Data from the Digital Electronics Unit (DECU) of the second engine showed no evidence of torque or temperature exceedance and the matched power conditions of the engines post-impact indicate {{that there was no}} sustained emergency power demand. No other evidence indicated any FADEC or engine faults." [...] It was expected that in a FADEC engine <b>runaway,</b> <b>engine</b> power would become asynchronous and mismatched. The investigation found the engines at the crash to have matched settings, decreasing the likelihood of a FADEC malfunction being involved.|$|E
60|$|They stepped aside, and he whizzed by, {{arms and}} legs going like mad, with the general {{appearance}} of a <b>runaway</b> <b>engine.</b> It {{would have been a}} triumphant descent, if a big dog had not bounced suddenly through one of the openings, and sent the whole concern helter-skelter into the gutter. Polly laughed as she ran to view the ruin, for Tom lay flat on his back with the velocipede atop him, while the big dog barked wildly, and his master scolded him for his awkwardness. But when she saw Tom's face, Polly was frightened, for the color had all gone out of it, his eyes looked strange and dizzy, and drops of blood began to trickle from a great cut on his forehead. The man saw it, too, and had him up in a minute; but he could n't stand, and stared about him in a dazed sort of way, as he sat on the curbstone, while Polly held her handkerchief to his forehead, and pathetically begged to know if he was killed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Taking my eight-bore, and half-a-dozen spare {{cartridges}} in my pocket, I made a d√©tour, {{and reaching}} the ant-heap in safety lay down. For {{a moment the}} wind had dropped, but presently a gentle puff of air passed over me, and blew on towards the rhinoceros. By the way, I wonder {{what it is that}} smells so strong about a man? Is it his body or his breath? I {{have never been able to}} make out, but I saw it stated the other day, that in the duck decoys the man who is working the ducks holds a little piece of burning turf before his mouth, and that if he does this they cannot smell him, which looks as though it were the breath. Well, whatever it was about me that attracted his attention, the rhinoceros soon smelt me, for within half a minute after the puff of wind had passed me he was on his legs, and turning round to get his head up wind. There he stood for a few seconds and sniffed, and then he began to move, first of all at a trot, then, as the scent grew stronger, at a furious gallop. On he came, snorting like a <b>runaway</b> <b>engine,</b> with his tail stuck straight up in the air; if he had seen me lie down there he could not have made a better line. It was rather nervous work, I can tell you, lying there waiting for his onslaught, for he looked like a mountain of flesh. I determined, however, not to fire till I could plainly see his eye, for I think that rule always gives one the right distance for big game; so I rested my rifle on the ant-heap and waited for him, kneeling. At last, when he was about forty yards away, I saw that the time had come, and aiming straight for the middle of the chest I pulled.|$|E

5000|$|Diesel <b>engine</b> <b>runaway</b> - {{excessive}} {{pressure in}} the crank case can force mist of engine lubricant into the intake manifold, which can be burnt {{in the same fashion}} as diesel.|$|R
50|$|Diesel <b>engine</b> <b>runaway</b> {{is a rare}} {{condition}} affecting diesel engines, {{in which}} the engine draws extra fuel from an unintended source and overspeeds at higher and higher RPM and producing up to 10 times the engine's rated output until destroyed by mechanical failure or bearing seizure through lack of lubrication.|$|R
50|$|Devereau {{and his men}} are gone, {{but with}} no one alive on the {{locomotive}} and the pedal depressed, the train is running away. Devereau's men had also disabled the emergency brakes. With {{the help of a}} steward (Scatman Crothers), George uncouples the passenger cars from the engine. The <b>runaway</b> <b>engine</b> roars at full speed into Chicago's Union Station, smashes through the end-of-track barrier, and on into the terminal, destroying everything in its path. The uncoupled passenger cars glide safely into to the station. Grover steals a sports car and drives away, and George and Hilly leave together.|$|E

50|$|The first {{aircraft}} to fly with the T40 was the Convair XP5Y-1 patrol aircraft prototype. As flying boat patrol aircraft became redundant, the US Navy changed {{the role of}} the aircraft from Anti-Submarine Warfare to Transport. Modifications to the XP5Y-1 (such as provision of air conditioning and pressurisation) produced the Convair R3Y Tradewind, which was to become the only aircraft using the T40 to actually enter service. These large four-engined flying boats served primarily between NAS Alameda and Hawaii during the mid-1950s, (replacing the Martin Mars flying boats). There were numerous problems with the T40s. One resulted in near disaster in 1956, when an R3Y managed to land with a <b>runaway</b> <b>engine,</b> resulting in a collision with a seawall. This event gave the US Navy one more reason to ground the R3Y, which it did soon after.|$|E
5000|$|Several ways {{to stop a}} <b>runaway</b> diesel <b>engine</b> are {{to block}} off the air intake, either {{physically}} using a cover or plug, or alternatively by directing a [...] fire extinguisher into the air intake to smother the engine. Engines fitted with a decompressor can also be stopped by operating the decompressor, and in a vehicle with a manual transmission it is sometimes possible to stop the engine by engaging a high gear (i.e. 4th, 5th, 6th etc.), with foot brake & parking brake fully applied, and letting out the clutch quickly to slow the engine RPM to a stop, without moving the vehicle.|$|R
60|$|The {{roar of the}} augmenting crowd, however, {{soon became}} so great that people in advance of him heard it, {{and some of these}} made demonstrations of a wish to try to stop him as he passed, but most of them wisely {{concluded}} that it would be nearly as safe to place themselves {{in the way of a}} <b>runaway</b> locomotive <b>engine.</b> One man proved an exception. He was a butcher, of great size and strength, who, being accustomed to knock down horned cattle with a hammer, naturally enough thought it not impossible to knock down a man with his fist, so he tried it.|$|R
25|$|With {{turbocharged}} engines, the oil seals on the turbocharger may fail, allowing {{lubricating oil}} into the combustion chamber, where it is burned like regular diesel fuel. In vehicles or installations that use diesel engines and also bottled gas, a gas leak into the engine room could also provide fuel for a <b>runaway,</b> via the <b>engine</b> air intake.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps not {{surprisingly}} given the station's physical limitations, {{only a month}} after it was opened there was a fatal accident when passenger Daniel Holmes was {{run over by a}} train. The other passengers had been waiting with others on the track when the Deptford train arrived. They climbed up on to the platform but Holmes remained on the track. The engine driver, Thomas Millender, was distracted by Holmes and collided with the waiting southbound train. A number of passengers who had already boarded the southbound train were injured and Holmes was killed instantly when Millender's <b>runaway</b> <b>engine</b> struck him. The duty policeman only just escaped also being struck and was dismissed for failing to warn the passengers in time. The accident was witnessed by George Walker, the L&GR's Resident Director, who subsequently wrote of the difficulties that his staff experienced in keeping people off the tracks.|$|E
5000|$|Only {{three stories}} in the {{original}} Star Trek series involved the Enterprise traveling beyond Warp 10 ( [...] Warp 11, briefly, {{as a result of}} Nomad's [...] "correction of inefficiencies" [...] in the antimatter control system in [...] "The Changeling"; Warp 11 again in [...] "By Any Other Name" [...] after the Kelvans modify the Enterprise's engines for greater sustained speed to make the trip from the Milky Way Galaxy to the Andromeda Galaxy; and Warp 14.1 in [...] "That Which Survives" [...] after the ship was put through a Kalandan transporter, beamed parsecs away from where it had been, and reassembled slightly out of phase). In The Next Generation, such stories were rare, and usually involved a malfunction in (or alien interference with) a starship's engines. A new warp scale was drawn up, with Warp Factor 10 set as an unattainable maximum (according to the new scale, reaching or exceeding Warp 10 required an infinite amount of energy). This is described in some technical manuals as [...] "Eugene's limit", in homage to creator/producer Gene Roddenberry. Warp 8 in the original series was the [...] "Never Exceed" [...] speed for the hulls and engines of Constitution-class starships, equivalent to the aircraft VNE V-speed. Warp 6 was the VNO [...] "Normal Operation" [...] maximum safe cruising speed for that vessel class. The Warp 14.1 incident was the result of <b>runaway</b> <b>engines</b> which brought the hull within seconds of structural failure before power was disengaged.|$|R
50|$|A {{gasoline}} engine is fed by either a carburetor with a butterfly valve or an air receiver with a throttle valve and fuel injectors. In {{both cases the}} operated valves (in case of car - the gas pedal), control the volume of air-fuel mixture taken into the engine and control engine speed. Finally the combustion cycle requires an ignition system in form of an electric spark, that is circuited to a switch (in case of car - the ignition key). Thus in the rare case of throttle linkage rupture, {{it is very easy}} to bring a <b>runaway</b> petrol <b>engine</b> to a stop by switching off the ignition.|$|R
5000|$|In 1938 Walter Eric Moore, {{a fireman}} {{attached}} to the Depot was killed when he was caught between the buffers of trucks near Bombo. He had disembarked from his train in order to adjust the air brakes when the accident occurred. Walter was a very long term resident of Thirroul. He had lived in [...] "Fairfield" [...] Main South Coast Road when he had enlisted twenty years earlier to fight in World War I. He later moved with his wife to Bath Street. After his death in 1938 his widow Thelma remained at Thirroul and later moved to Sydney. In 1940 Roy Davidson, a fireman {{attached to the}} Thirroul Depot was struck by another engine when changing points for his own train. His leg was severely injured. In 1951 John Hay, a guard, was killed instantly when a <b>runaway</b> steam <b>engine</b> struck him at Unanderra siding.|$|R
40|$|Recently, an {{incremental}} type sensor based backstepping (SBB) control approach, based on singular perturbation theory and Tikhonov‚Äôs theorem, has been proposed. This Lyapunov function based method uses measurements of control variables and less model knowledge, {{and it is}} not susceptible to the model uncertainty caused by fault scenarios. In this paper, the SBB method has been implemented on a fixed wing aircraft with its focus on handling structural changes caused by damages. A new hybrid autopilot flight controller has been developed for a Boeing 747 - 200 aircraft after combining nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) with SBB control approach. Two benchmarks for fault tolerant flight control (FTFC), named rudder <b>runaway</b> and <b>engine</b> separation, are employed to evaluate the proposed method. The simulation results show that the proposed control approach leads to a zero tracking-error performance in nominal condition and guarantees the stability of the closed-loop system under failures as long as the reference commands are located in the safe flight envelope.

25|$|Most modern road use {{diesel engines}} are {{provided}} with an FRP valve in the intake manifold (usually mistaken {{by some as a}} petrol engine throttle body). In most basic applications this valve will close a flow of air mixture to the engine when the vehicle is switched off, preventing diesel <b>engine</b> <b>runaway</b> by starving the engine of oxygen; this will also make standard shutdown much smoother by eliminating compression and decompression rattle by making the pistons effectively work in vacuum. In more advanced control systems this FRP valve can be shut by an electronic control unit when it senses runaway scenario.|$|R
2500|$|The {{crank case}} {{ventilation}} of [...] modern road-use diesel engines is diverted into the intake manifold, because ventilating the crank case into outside air is inadvisable due to lubricant mist it contains. If the engine's piston rings malfunction, this will cause excessive {{pressure in the}} crank case forcing mist of engine lubricant into the intake manifold. Since most engines use oil which can be burnt {{in the same fashion}} as diesel, this will result in diesel <b>engine</b> <b>runaway.</b> To prevent that, more premium crank case ventilation solutions are fitted with a filter to catch out lubricant mist.|$|R

25|$|The {{viscosity}} {{requirement of}} diesel fuel is usually specified at 40¬∞C. A disadvantage of diesel {{as a vehicle}} fuel in cold climates is that its viscosity increases as the temperature decreases, changing it into a gel (see Compression Ignition ‚Äì Gelling) that cannot flow in fuel systems. Special low-temperature diesel contains additives to keep it liquid at lower temperatures, but starting a diesel engine in very cold weather may still pose considerable difficulties. Another disadvantage of diesel engines compared to petrol/gasoline engines {{is the possibility of}} diesel <b>engine</b> <b>runaway</b> failure. Since diesel engines do not need spark ignition, they can run as long as diesel fuel is supplied. Fuel is typically supplied via a fuel pump. If the pump breaks down in an open position, the supply of fuel will be unrestricted, and the engine will run away and risk terminal failure.|$|R
