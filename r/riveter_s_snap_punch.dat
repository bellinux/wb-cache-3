40|$|Background: Peripheral {{neuropathy}} is {{a common}} complication of diabetes mellitus. Among the diabetic neuropathies symmetrical sensory polyneuropathy {{is the most common}} one. Abnormalities of sensory nerve conduction are features of diabetic nerve damage. Significant association has been found between electrophysiological parameters of sensory nerves and duration of metabolic derangement in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Objectives: The present study was designed to characterize nerve conduction abnormalities of sensory nerves in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus of different duration and also to assess whether duration of diabetes has any influence on the sensory nerve function. Methods: Forty-four type 2 diabetic subjects were included in two groups:- Group B 1 consisted of 23 diabetic subjects having duration of diabetes for 5 - 10 years (shorter duration) and Group B 2 consisted of 21 diabetic subjects having duration of diabetes for 10 - 15 years (longer duration). Twenty-five age and BMI matched healthy subjects without family history of diabetes were included as Group A (control) subjects. Sensory nerve conduction velocities, action potential amplitudes and latencies of ulnar and sural nerves were measured by a standard NCV-EMG equipment. Result: No significant changes in sensory nerve conduction parameters were observed in the group of diabetic subjects having shorter duration of diabetes. In the diabetic group with relatively longer duration of diabetes some of the sensory nerve conduction parameters were affected. Among them <b>S</b> <b>SNAP</b> and <b>S</b> NCV were significantly (P< 0. 01 and < 0. 05 respectively) reduced in diabetic group with relatively longer duration of diabetes. Conclusion: The results of the study indicated that neuronal dysfunction for sensory nerves appears after a prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia; there may also be some genetic and biochemical basis (other than hyperglycemia) for early sensory sparing in type 2 diabetic population of Bangladesh.

40|$|The {{problems}} of determining residues of inhibitors in raw milk, i. e. selection of methods and identification {{are discussed in}} the paper. LPT, MaI- 1, Copan, Valio T 101, Penzym <b>S,</b> β-STAR, <b>SNAP</b> and ROSA tests for determining inhibitors in raw cows’ milk were evaluated. The objects of investigation - milk with selected concentrations of inhibitory substances (antibiotics, detergents, etc.) and “positive” samples (i. e. containing inhibitors) of raw milk. LPT, MaI- 1 and Copan tests were sensitive to all β-lactams at EU Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs), the other tests (Valio T 101, Penzym <b>S,</b> β-STAR, <b>SNAP</b> and ROSA), to 2 – 4 of β-lactams investigated. All microbial tests were sensitive to the same detergents: TAAB- 1, TAAB- 2 and PESETTI ANTIBACT (0. 2; 1. 0 and 1. 0 %, resp). The occurrence of inhibitors could not be evaluated by enzymatic and immuno/receptor tests in many cases because of abnormalities in colours or testing procedure. The results of investigating “positive” raw milk samples showed that there were no differences between MaI-I – Copan tests. Differences were found, though, between MaI- 1 - Valio T 101, MaI- 1 - Penzym S, MaI- 1 - β-STAR and MaI- 1 - ROSA tests. The comparison of the tests according to the method of use showed that the Copan test was simple to use and interpret, had a long shelf life and was sensitive to many groups of investigated inhibitors. β-STAR was the most rapid and easy to read the result from the immuno/receptor tests. Since the penicillins were determined to be the main group of inhibitors found in raw cows’ milk in Lithuania (86. 2 % of the “positive” samples), the rapid tests for β-lactams can be successfully used for screening milk at the milk processing plants. A proposition concerning selection and validation of methods for identification of inhibitors realizing the Commission Decision of 91 / 180 EEC was made...|$|R

40|$|In neurons, the C {{terminus}} of the Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) binds to {{the protein}} kinase C-interacting protein/histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (PKCI/HINT 1) {{which in turn}} binds the regulator of G-protein signalling RGSZ 1 /Z 2 (RGSZ) protein. In this study, we found that intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of morphine recruits PKC isoforms, mostly PKCγ, to the MOR via the HINT 1 /RGSZ complex. There, diacylglycerol (DAG) activates this PKCγ to phosphorylate the MOR and thus, its signal strength was reduced. When PKCI/HINT 1 expression is depressed, morphine produces stronger analgesic effects and neither the PKCγ-MOR complex nor serine phosphorylation of this receptor is detected. This MOR-PKC association involves the cysteine rich domains (CRDs) in the regulatory C 1 region of PKC, as well as requiring free zinc ions, HINT 1 and RGSZ proteins. Increasing the availability of this metal ion recruits inactive PKCγ to the MOR, while phorbol esters prevent this binding and even disrupt it. The nitric oxide donor (<b>S)</b> -Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (<b>SNAP)</b> foments the association of PKCγ with the MORs, effect that was prevented by the heavy metal chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2 -pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), suggesting a role for endogenous zinc and neural nitric oxide synthase. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, MK 801, also prevented PKCγ recruitment to MORs and serine phosphorylation of the receptors following icv morphine. These {{results indicate that the}} NMDAR/nNOS cascade, activated via MORs, provide the free zinc ions required for inactive PKCγ to bind to HINT 1 /RGSZ complex at the C terminus of the receptor. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Puck sings Avril Lavigne's song Keep Holding On to her hoping that this would win her heart, but she turns him down stating that she loves Biff. Later, Quinn and Biff are having dinner at Breadsticks when Santana, Puck, Mike, and Artie show up. They sit with Quinn at her table and Biff reveals that he doesn't know any thing about Quinn's past. Her friends tell her about her behavior in the episode The Purple Piano Project. Quinn asks Biff to get something out of the car for her and after he leaves, she asks her friends not to mention anything to Biff since she is ashamed of her past. Puck asks her if she is ever going to tell him about their relationship and their daughter, Beth, and she says that she will eventually. This somewhat angers Puck as he tells her that she can't hide from the past and should embrace it. A few days later, Puck is hanging by the school buses when he hears Quinn and Biff fighting. Biff becomes angry with her at the fact that she kept so much from him, including having a baby with Puck. He calls her a slut, causing Puck to <b>snap</b> and <b>punch</b> him.

40|$|In the 1930 s, University of Western Ontario surgeon, Dr Edwin Seaborn {{recorded}} {{a series of}} interviews with members of the Saugeen First Nation to learn about their medical practices. Seaborn used a wax cylinder recording device owned by the medical school. One interview dealt with the death of Shawnee war chief Tecumseh, as told by the grandson of an eye witness to the event. British, Canadian and First Nations 2 ̆ 7 forces retreated eastward up the trail by the Thames River in October 1813. Tecumseh insisted they turn to fight the advancing Americans. The night before the Battle of the Thames, Tecumseh slept in a large barn on Lemuel Sherman 2 ̆ 7 s farm in Thamesville. A hole was made in the wall of the barn so that Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s horse could be haltered beside him. Most of the barn was used as a hospital. Later the victorious Americans would use the barn for the same purpose. General Proctor and his officers stayed in the farm house. At daybreak on the 5 th October 1813, before the men had eaten, Proctor moved into position at Moraviantown. American mounted troops quickly broke through and routed the British line of regulars, who immediately fled leaving Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s force to fight alone. Tecumseh was killed and his body allegedly mutilated. Despite conflicting accounts of Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s death, it was quickly assumed into American mythology with a frieze painted into the Rotunda of the Capitol and an iconic sculpture displayed at the Smithsonian Institution. Bragging rights claiming responsibility were used by the successful presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison and the unsuccessful one of Richard Johnson. Tecumseh Sherman, later a leading union civil war general, was named for the slain hero. Searching for Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s grave became an obsession of 19 th century America. Seaborn 2 ̆ 7 s recording presents a relatively unknown account of Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s death from the aboriginal perspective. It describes the chief fighting with 2 ̆ 7 a long knife 2 ̆ 7 on a bridge to his right and his left. Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> lance <b>snapped</b> close to his grip and he fell after 2 ̆ 7 a long knife 2 ̆ 7 was run through his shoulder from behind. The witness hid in the water by 2 ̆ 7 turning himself into a turtle 2 ̆ 7 under a log. He saw Americans take the body of another warrior to a tree and mutilate it. This record contradicts the self serving account of Col. Richard Johnson that is depicted in the Capitol but it is consistent with evidence that Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s body was secretly protected by succeeding aboriginal generations until it reached its final resting place on Walpole Island. Sharing sacred stories demonstrates a special level of trust between aboriginal people and the white medical community of the early 20 th century. The Sherman barn represents one of the first hospitals in Western Ontario. Artifacts collected by Seaborn including the wax cylinders and the Sherman barn boards used to halter Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s horse probably remain in collections in London, Ontario...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{reports have}} {{documented}} {{the utility of}} percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty of the mitral valve in adult patients with mitral stenosis, but the mechanism of successful valve dilation {{and the effect of}} mitral valvuloplasty on cardiac performance have not been studied in detail. Accordingly, mitral valvuloplasty was performed in five postmortem specimens and in 18 adult patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, using either one (25 mm) or two (18 and 20 mm) dilation balloons. Postmortem balloon dilation resulted in increased valve orifice area in all five postmortem specimens, secondary to separation of fused commissures and fracture of nodular calcium within the mitral leaflets. In no case did balloon dilation result in tearing of valve leaflets, disruption of the mitral ring or liberation of potentially embolic debris. Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty in 18 patients with severe mitral stenosis (including 9 with a heavily calcified valve) resulted in an increase in cardiac output (4. 3 ± 1. 1 to 5. 1 ± 1. 5 liters/min, p < 0. 01) and mitral valve area (0. 9 ± 0. 2 to 1. 6 ± 0. 4 cm 2, p < 0. 0001), and a decrease in mean mitral pressure gradient (15 ± 5 to 9 ± 4 mm Hg, p < 0. 0001), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (23 ± 7 to 18 ± 7 mm Hg, p < 0. 0001) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (36 ± 12 to 33 ± 12 mm Hg, p < 0. 01). Left ventriculography before and after valvuloplasty in 14 of the 18 patients showed a mild (≤ 1 +) increase in mitral regurgitation in five patients and no change in the remainder. Embolic phenomena were not observed in any patient. Serial radionuclide ventriculography showed an increase in left ventricular peak filling rate (2. 20 ± 1. 20 to 2. 50 ± 1. 20 end-diastolic volumes per second [EDV/s], p < 0. 05). Serial echocardiography/phonocardiography showed improvement in mitral valve excursion (11 ± 6 to 14 ± 6 mm, p < 0. 001), mitral EF slope (7 ± 4 to 13 ± 5, p < 0. 001), left atrial diameter (5. 7 ± 0. 9 to 5. 3 ± 0. 8 cm, p < 0. 001), <b>S</b> 2 -opening <b>snap</b> interval (0. 07 ± 0. 03 to 0. 08 ± 0. 02 second, p < 0. 02) and mitral valve area (0. 9 ± 0. 2 to 1. 5 ± 0. 4 cm 2, p < 0. 0001). All patients were discharged from the hospital with de- creased symptoms after valvuloplasty. It is concluded that percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty can be performed in adult patients with mitral stenosis, including patients with calcific disease, and can result in significant improvement in valvular function. The mechanisms of successful dilation include commissural separation and fracture of nodular calcium...|$|R
40|$|On social {{networking}} services, sharing is caring. However, {{depending on who}} or what is involved, sharing can {{be the source of}} a community transgression, copyright infringement, a violation of employment policies or worse. If people who use social media, mobile messaging apps and social devices do not know where the ethical or legal lines are drawn, in jurisprudence, in vendor Terms of Service, in professional codes of conduct or in keeping with online social norms, they are in jeopardy of being publicly shamed or even sued. Users may also put their employers, friends and colleagues at risk of community, professional or legal penalties in an era where the boundary between work and leisure is becoming even more blurred. This mixed-methods, interdisciplinary research project explores the current state of awareness on a range of legal and ethical issues involving User-Generated Content (UGC) and other forms of Electronically Stored Information (ESI) on social networks and devices for personal and enterprise use and for several different constituencies, including marketers, artists, journalists, academics, educators, entrepreneurs, bloggers, photographers and videographers. The quantitative, numeric data resulting from an online survey as well as qualitative, descriptive data gathered from semi-structured interviews with participants and observations gleaned in contextual inquiry will help address gaps in current research on this subject. In addition, the research findings will guide design directions for a tool, intervention or affordance to help users become better informed about privacy, intellectual property and information governance in the context of electronic sharing and more easily put this knowledge into practice. The first phase of developing the survey protocol is already underway, with a literature review completed and the survey submitted for IRB review as # 1602921512. Pilot contextual inquiries and field studies are being pursued to guide development of qualitative research phases in the future. 1. 	Bohn, J., et al.
