30|$|In the {{cooperative}} transmission at physical layer, source <b>nodes</b> and <b>relay</b> <b>nodes</b> cooperatively deliver {{signal to the}} destination node. It requires additional capabilities to synchronize between source <b>nodes</b> and <b>relay</b> <b>nodes</b> and to combine signals at the destination [6]. The <b>relay</b> <b>nodes</b> may have different strategies when forwarding the signal from the source node: the <b>relay</b> <b>nodes</b> amplify then forward (amplify-and-forward) [7]; the <b>relay</b> <b>nodes</b> decode then forward (decode-and-forward) [7]; or the <b>relay</b> <b>nodes</b> retransmit the signal that they receive from the sources to the destination only when the destination fails to decode the information packet (incremental relaying) [6]. In particular, the research in [6] showed that the incremental relaying protocol provides the best outage behavior among these cooperation protocols as there are occasions that the information packets need to send only once. The behavior of the CPR protocol {{is similar to that}} of the incremental relaying protocol except that CPR protocol is performed at network layer. However, the CPR protocol is more flexible than the incremental relaying protocol since it does not require extra capabilities at physical layer.|$|R
