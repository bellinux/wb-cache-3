40|$|Building on {{cognitive}} theory, {{the present study}} is the first to test whether high restrained eaters show an immediate and delayed memory bias for pictorial food cues and to investigate the effects of food-related thought suppression on memory. Seventy participants (including both high and low <b>restrainers)</b> were asked either to suppress thoughts about food (Suppression food) or about animals (Suppression animals) or to monitor thoughts about food (Control food) or about animals (Control animals). Afterward, all participants were exposed to pictures of food and animals, and they completed two free-recall tasks for these cues. High <b>restrainers</b> remembered more food cues than low <b>restrainers</b> (both immediately and after delay). Also, the latter group remembered fewer food words than animal words, whereas there was no such difference in high <b>restrainers.</b> Hence, the results provide support for a pictorial food-related memory bias in high <b>restrainers.</b> The effects of suppression are less straightforward, but there was some support for a brief but enhancing effect of food-related thought suppression on memory for food cues...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the transient rocking response of anchored blocks subjected to physically realizable horizontal pulse-type motion. <b>Restrainers</b> with elastic-brittle and elastic-plastic behavior are considered. Under one-sine pulse anchored blocks can overturn with two distinct modes of overturning: (1) by exhibiting one impact; and (1) without exhibiting any impact. It is found that <b>restrainers</b> are more efficient in preventing overturning of small slender blocks subjected to low frequency pulses. The study uncovers that while {{for most of}} the frequency range anchored blocks survive higher accelerations than free-standing blocks, there is a finite frequency range where the opposite happens. The paper examines this counterintuitive behavior and explains the destructive effect that increased strength and increased ductility of <b>restrainers</b> have on the rocking stability of rigid structures when excited by certain ground motions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{behaviour}} of slotted-bolted connections {{when the}} maximum slip travel exceeds the available slot length is presented. The drastic degradation behaviour of slotted-bolted connections under bolt impact is demonstrated. Remedy {{by means of}} the concept of <b>restrainers</b> is proposed, which is also advantageous in suppressing the build-up of resonance motion by virtue of the change in system stiffness at different stages. Nonlinear dynamic analyses are performed on two buildings equipped with the friction dampers with and without <b>restrainers.</b> The first structure, a 6 -storey steel building with moment-resisting frame, is subjected to strong near-field earthquakes. The second one, a typical 6 -storey reinforced concrete building in Bangkok with non-seismic design, is investigated under moderate ground motions induced by distant earthquakes. In the worst loading cases, the damper with <b>restrainers</b> is superior to that without <b>restrainers,</b> resulting in reduction of the peak inter-storey drift in the order of 16 - 20 % and the peak slip travel 15 - 30 %. The shorter slip travel obviously provides extra safety to the damper against bolt impact. Although the peak inter-storey drift and the peak slip travel of the device decrease with increasing in the restraining force limit, the extra gain has to be balanced with the potential of buckling of the bracing at the high restraining force in the case of retrofitting with bracings...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This article {{examines}} thought suppression tendencies in restrained eaters. Furthermore, the dynamics between failing thought suppression and thought control strategies are explored. Methods: One hundred and five overweight and normal-weight {{boys and girls}} (12 - 18 years) participated in a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study. A distinction was made between disinhibited restrained eaters (high restraint/high disinhibition), inhibited restrained eaters (high restraint/low disinhibition) and unrestrained eaters (low restraint) in both weight-groups. The Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) was used to select the different groups of (un) restrained eaters. The White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI) was employed to measure thought suppression and intrusions. The Thought Control Questionnaire (TCQ) {{was used to measure}} thought control strategies (distraction, punishment, reappraisal, worry, social control). Results: The disinhibited <b>restrainers</b> obtained meaningfully higher scores on WBSI-total, WBSI-thought suppression and WBSI-intrusion than the inhibited <b>restrainers</b> and unrestrained eaters in both weight groups. Those who scored high on WBSI-total, obtained significantly higher scores on the TCQ subscales distraction, worry and punishment, than those who scored low on WBSI-total. Discussion: The findings suggest that disinhibited <b>restrainers,</b> irrespective of their weight status, report a high tendency to suppress thoughts. Given Wegner's theoretical account, this may be associated with preoccupations and self-control difficulties. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity is {{a growing}} health problem, but most people find dieting unsuccessful. Three studies examine {{possible}} reasons for the difficulty {{and the extent to}} which dieting-related reductions in cognitive function are associated with mood and well-being. METHOD: In Study One, 49 female dieters were compared with a control group of 31 matched non-dieters on measures of well-being, mood, eating behaviour (Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire), and attention. Study Two examined two measures of restraint to examine why previous studies find high <b>restrainers</b> are prone to react to emotion. Study Three experimentally manipulated mood using music and the standard Velten Induction Procedure to examine attention in <b>restrainers</b> and emotional eaters. RESULTS: Dieting was found to be associated with deficits in sustained attention. This finding was further supported by the demonstration of a significant impairment in performance following a negative mood induction in high emotional eaters whereas high <b>restrainers</b> were relatively unaffected by the mood challenge. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that different aspects of eating behaviour have dissociable effects on cognitive-affective function. Trait tendencies to restrained eating are associated with attentional deficits, but are not further affected by mood disruption. It is the long-term tendency to eat when emotional that combines with current emotional state to trigger cognitive deficits...|$|R

Furthermore, an evaluation of {{the effectiveness of}} the use of cable <b>restrainers</b> is presented. For this purpose, the bridge seismic performance has been evaluated on four different radii of curvature, considering two cases: restrained and unrestrained curved viaducts. Depending on the radius of curvature, three-dimensional non-linear dynamic analysis shows the vulnerability of curved viaducts to pounding and deck unseating damage. In this study, the efficiency of using LRB supports combined with cable <b>restrainers</b> on curved viaducts is demonstrated, not only by reducing in all cases the possible damage, but also by providing a similar behavior in the viaducts despite of curvature radius.

50|$|Metol is an {{excellent}} developing agent for most continuous tone developer applications, {{and it has been}} widely used in published developer formulas as well as commercial products. However, it is difficult to produce highly concentrated developer solutions using Metol, and therefore most Metol developers are supplied in dry chemical mix. A developer containing both Metol and hydroquinone is called an MQ developer. This combination of agents provide greater developer activity since the rate of development by both agents together is greater than the sum of rates of developments by each agent used alone (superadditivity). This combination is very versatile; by varying the quantities of Metol, hydroquinone, <b>restrainer,</b> and adjusting the pH, the entire range of continuous tone developers can be made. Therefore, Metol replaced most other developing agents except for hydroquinone, Phenidone (which is more recent than Metol), and derivatives of Phenidone. Notable formulas include Eastman Kodak D-76 film developer, D-72 print developer, and D-96 motion picture negative developer.|$|E
