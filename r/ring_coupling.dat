In particular, we analyze the synchronization patterns of unidirectionally <b>coupled</b> <b>rings,</b> bidirectionally <b>coupled</b> <b>rings,</b> and open chains of Kuramoto oscillators. Our approach includes an analytical and semianalytical study of the existence and stability of different in-phase and out-of-phase periodic solutions, complemented by numerical simulations. The delay is found to act differently on networks possessing different symmetries. While for the unidirectionally <b>coupled</b> <b>ring</b> the <b>coupling</b> delay is mainly observed to induce multistability, its effect on bidirectionally <b>coupled</b> <b>rings</b> is to enhance the most symmetric solution.

In addition to the main peak at the resonant frequency of the coupled dipole Robinson mode, another peak occurs at the resonant frequency of the coupled quadrupole mode. To describe these peaks analytically for a quadratic synchrotron potential, we include the dipole and quadrupole modes when calculating the beam response to generator noise. We thereby obtain the transfer function from generator-noise phase modulation to beam phase modulation with and without phase feedback. For Robinson-stable bunches confined in a synchrotron potential with a single minimum, the calculated transfer function agrees with measurements at the Aladdin 800 -MeV electron storage ring. The transfer function is useful in evaluating phase feedback that suppresses Robinson oscillations {{in order to obtain}} quiet operation of an infrared beam line...|$|E

It is found that, even when the system can be described as a single quantum ring with a small cleft, the electron energy levels show two different Aharonov-Bohm oscillation periods, which indicate that the carriers are localized in either the inner or the outer ring. For most distances between the rings, the electron and hole energy levels show almost identical Aharonov-Bohm oscillation periods. However, there is a short distances range in which they do not localize in the same ring, showing very different periods. In this region, the exciton ground state becomes dark.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{efficient}} parametric frequency comb generation in microresonators, external control of coupling between the cavity and the bus waveguide is necessary. However, for passive monolithically integrated structures, the coupling gap is fixed and cannot be externally controlled, making tuning the coupling inherently challenging. We design a dual-cavity coupled microresonator structure in which tuning one ring resonance frequency induces {{a change in the}} overall cavity coupling condition. We demonstrate wide extinction tunability with high efficiency by engineering the <b>ring</b> <b>coupling</b> conditions. Additionally, we note a distinct dispersion tunability resulting from coupling two cavities of slightly different path lengths, and present a new method of modal dispersion engineering. Our fabricated devices consist of two coupled high quality factor silicon nitride microresonators, where the extinction ratio of the resonances can be controlled using integrated microheaters. Using this extinction tunability, we optimize comb generation efficiency as well as provide tunability for avoiding higher-order mode-crossings, known for degrading comb generation. The device is able to provide a 110 -fold improvement in the comb generation efficiency.

40|$|Many coal model {{compound}} {{studies have}} focused on the mechanisms of bond cleavage reactions, and the means to alter reaction conditions to promote such reactions. However, there has become increasing interest in elucidating mechanisms associated with retrogressive or retrograde reactions in coal processing, which involve the formation of refractory bonds. Retrograde reactions inhibit efficient thermochemical processing of coals into liquid fuels, which has been particularly well-documented for low rank coals where abundant oxygen-containing functional groups are thought to {{play a key role in}} the chemistry. Much less is known about retrogressive reactions for ether-containing model compounds. Radical recombination through <b>ring</b> <b>coupling</b> of phenoxy radicals in benzyl phenyl ether (BPE) is known to lead to more refractory diphenylmethane linkages to a limited extent. Since this chemistry may be attributed at least in part to cage recombination, it could be promoted in a diffusionally constrained environment such as in the coal macromolecule. Using silica-immobilization to simulate restricted diffusion in coal, the authors have found that retrogressive reactions can be promoted for certain hydrocarbon model compounds. The authors have now begun an examination of the thermolysis behavior of silica-immobilized benzyl phenyl ether at 275 [...] 325 C. The initial results indicate that two retrogressive reaction pathways, radical recombination and molecular rearrangement through Si-O-C linkage to the surface of PhOCH{center_dot}Ph, are promoted by restricted diffusion. Remarkably, the retrograde products typically account for 50 mol% of the thermolysis products...|$|E

The lifetimes of the triplet ketones vary substantially with the electron-donating ability of the substituents in the ?-aryloxy ring, with values ranging from 30 ns for the 4 -methoxy derivative to 5. 5 for the 4 -cyano ketone in acetonitrile. The triplet ketones are considerably longer lived on a silica surface than in solution and do not decay with first-order kinetics; however, they are all shorter lived than triplet acetoveratrone under the same conditions, indicating that ?-phenyl quenching and (or) ?-cleavage dominate their decay. The same triplets show quite different kinetic behavior in Na-X or cellulose and there is no indication in these systems for the importance of either ?-phenyl quenching or ?-cleavage in determining the rates of triplet decay. Product studies for ?-guaiacoxyacetoveratrone indicate that ?-cleavage from the singlet excited state is responsible for product formation; in contrast to solution results, the phenacyl radical pairs react exclusively by geminate recombination to give rearranged ketones resulting from ortho and para <b>ring</b> <b>coupling</b> of the two radicals.

The ESR spectra of a number of methylnaphthalene cations have been generated using AlCl₃/SO₂ and their spectra recorded and analysed. For those methylnaphthalenes which did not have methyl substituents in the 1 and 4 or 1 and 5 positions, a series of compounds with g= 2. 008 were recorded.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this effort is to develop an analytical model for the coupling of active noise control (ANC) piston-type actuators that are mounted flush to {{the inner and outer}} walls of an annular duct to the modes in the duct generated by the actuator motion. The analysis will be used to couple the ANC actuators to the modal analysis propagation computer program for the annular duct, to predict the effects of active suppression of fan-generated engine noise sources. This combined program will then be available to assist in the design or evaluation of ANC systems in fan engine annular exhaust ducts. An analysis has been developed to predict the modes generated in an annular duct due to the coupling of flush-mounted ring actuators on the inner and outer walls of the duct. The analysis has been combined with a previous analysis for the coupling of modes to a cylindrical duct in a FORTRAN computer program to perform the computations. The method includes the effects of uniform mean flow in the duct. The program can be used for design or evaluation purposes for active noise control hardware for turbofan engines. Predictions for some sample cases modeled after the geometry of the NASA Lewis ANC Fan indicate very efficient coupling in both the inlet and exhaust ducts for the m = 6 spinning mode at frequencies where only a single radial mode is cut-on. Radial mode content in higher order cut-off modes at the source plane and the required actuator displacement amplitude to achieve 110 dB SPL levels in the desired mode were predicted. Equivalent cases with and without flow were examined for the cylindrical and annular geometry, and little difference was found for a duct flow Mach number of 0. 1. The actuator <b>ring</b> <b>coupling</b> program will be adapted as a subroutine to the cylindrical duct modal analysis and the exhaust duct modal analysis. This will allow the fan source to be defined in terms of characteristic modes at the fan source plane and predict the propagation to the arbitrarily-located ANC source plane. The actuator velocities can then be determined to generate the anti-phase mode. The resulting combined fan source/ANC pressure can then be calculated at any desired wall sensor position. The actuator velocities can be determined manually or using a simulation of a control system feedback loop. This will provide a very useful ANC system design and evaluation tool...|$|E
