The lever is operated by applying an input force FA at a point A located by the coordinate vector rA on the bar. The lever then exerts an output force FB at the point B located by rB.

40|$|The {{restoration}} of the hip centre of rotation in an anatomical position {{is considered to be}} relevant for total hip prosthesis survival. When the cup is implanted with a high centre of <b>rotation,</b> the <b>lever</b> arm of the abductor muscles is decreased, causing higher joint-reaction forces. Modular stems with varying lengths and geometries can be used to balance soft tissues, and ceramic bearing surfaces can be used to reduce the wear rate. Forty-four hip replacements performed with a high hip centre of rotation were matched with 44 performed with an anatomical centre of rotation. In all cases the preoperative diagnosis was dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and cementless modular neck prostheses with ceramic bearing surfaces were used. At nine years follow-up the mean Harris hip and WOMAC scores were not statistically different.

40|$|All {{members of}} the diverse myosin {{superfamily}} have a highly conserved globular motor domain that contains the actin- and nucleotide-binding sites and produces force and movement. The light-chain-binding domain connects the motor domain {{to a variety of}} functionally specialized tail domains and amplifies small structural changes in the motor domain through <b>rotation</b> of a <b>lever</b> arm. Myosins move on polarized actin filaments either forwards to the barbed (+) or backwards to the pointed (-) end. Here, we describe the engineering of an artificial backwards-moving myosin from three pre-existing molecular building blocks. These blocks are: a forward-moving class I myosin motor domain, a directional inverter formed by a four-helix bundle segment of human guanylate-binding protein- 1 and an artificial lever arm formed by two alpha-actinin repeats. Our results prove that reverse-direction movement of myosins can be achieved simply by rotating the direction of the lever arm 180 degrees...|$|R
50|$|The cams {{at the end}} of each lever on {{the female}} end align with a {{circumferential}} groove on the male end. When the levers are rotated to the locked position, they pull the male end into the female socket, creating a tight seal up against a gasket. The arms lock into position using an over-center arrangement, preventing accidental decoupling. Because the groove is cut all the way around the male end, there is no specific alignment necessary to couple as there would be with threaded connectors, and there is no opportunity for cross-threading. This results in an error-resistant, faster coupling operation. Because the compression between the two fittings is limited by the size of the cams on the end of the <b>levers</b> and the <b>rotation</b> of the <b>levers</b> themselves, there is also no possibility of over- or under-tightening the fitting; the pressure against the sealing gasket is effectively constant from one coupling operation to the next, reducing possibility of leaks.|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. The {{evolution}} of feeding mechanisms in the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) {{is a compelling}} example of transformation in a musculoskeletal complex involving multiple skeletal elements and numerous muscles that power skull motion. Biomechanical models of jaw force and skull kinetics aid our understanding of these complex systems and enable broad comparison of feeding mechanics across taxa. Mechanical models characterize how muscles move skeletal elements by pulling bones around points of <b>rotation</b> in <b>lever</b> mech-anisms, or by transmitting force through skeletal elements connected in a linkage. Previous work {{has focused on the}} feeding biomechanics of several lineages of fishes, but a broader survey of skull function in the context of quantitative models has not been attempted. This study begins such a survey by examining the diversity of mechanical design of the oral jaws in 35 species of ray-finned fishes with three main objectives: (1) analyze lower jaw lever models in a broad phylogenetic range of taxa, (2) identify the origin and evo-lutionary patterns of change in the linkage systems that power maxillary rotation and upper jaw protrusion, and (3) analyze patterns of change in feeding design in the context of actinopterygian phylogeny. The mandibular lever is present in virtually all actinopterygians, and the diversity in lower jaw closing force transmission capacity, with mechanical advantage ranging from 0. 04 to 0. 68, has important functional con-sequences. A four-bar linkage for maxillary rotation arose in the Amiiformes and persists in various forms in many teleost species. Novel mechanisms for upper jaw protrusion based on this linkage for maxillary rotation have evolved independently at least five times in teleosts. The widespread anterior jaws linkage for jaw protrusion in percomorph fishes arose initially in Zeiformes and subsequently radiated into a wide range of premaxillary protrusion capabilities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>rotation</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm of myosin cross-bridges is {{believed}} to be responsible for muscle contraction. To resolve details of this rotation, it is necessary to observe a single cross-bridge. It is still impossible to do so in muscle fiber, but it is possible to investigate a small population of cross-bridges by simultaneously activating myosin in a femtoliter volume by rapid release of caged ATP. In earlier work, in which the number of observed cross-bridges was limited to ∼ 600 by confocal microscopy, we were able to measure the rates of cross-bridge detachment and rebinding. However, we were unable to resolve the power stroke. We speculated that the reason for this was that the number of observed cross-bridges was too large. In an attempt to decrease this number, we used two-photon microscopy which permitted observation of ∼ 1 / 2 as many cross-bridges as before with the same signal/noise ratio. With the two-photon excitation, the number of cross-bridges was small enough to resolve the beginning of the power stroke. The results indicated that the power stroke begins ∼ 170 ms after the rigor cross-bridge first binds ATP...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A novel {{profilometer}} for three-dimensional (3 D) surface topography measurement is presented. The profilometer has large measuring range, {{high precision}} and small measuring touch force. It {{is composed of}} a two-dimensional (2 D) displacement sensor, a 3 D platform based on vertical scanning, measuring and control circuits and an industrial control computer. When a workpiece is measured, the vertical undulation of the profile at a sampling point leads to a zero offset of the 2 D displacement sensor. According to the zero offset, a piezoelectric actuator and a servo motor drive the vertical scanning platform to move vertically {{to ensure that the}} lever returns to its balance position. So the non-linear error caused by the <b>rotation</b> of the <b>lever</b> is very small even if the measuring range is large. When the stylus barges up against a steep wall, the horizontal resistance force results in another zero offset of the 2 D displacement sensor. If the zero offset exceeds a quota, the vertical scanning platform descends to make the stylus climb the steep wall successfully. According to the theoretical and experimental analysis, the profilometer can measure roughness, profile of sphere, step, groove and other 3 D surfaces with curvature precisely...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} the powerstroke in muscle is examined by resonance energy transfer techniques. Recent models suggesting a pre-cocking of the myosin head involving an enormous <b>rotation</b> between the <b>lever</b> arm and the catalytic domain were tested by measuring separation distances among myosin subfragment- 2, the nucleotide site, and the regulatory light chain {{in the presence of}} nucleotide transition state analogs. Only small changes (< 0. 5 nm) were detected that are consistent with internal conformational changes of the myosin molecule, but not with extreme differences in the average lever arm position suggested by some atomic models. These results were confirmed by stopped-flow resonance energy transfer measurements during single ATP turnovers on myosin. To examine the participation of actin in the powerstroke process, resonance energy transfer between the regulatory light chain on myosin subfragment- 1 and the C-terminus of actin was measured in the presence of nucleotide transition state analogs. The efficiency of energy transfer was much greater in the presence of ADP-AlF 4, ADP-BeFx, and ADP-vanadate than in the presence of ADP or no nucleotide. These data detect profound differences in the conformations of the weakly and strongly attached cross-bridges that appear to result from a conformational selection that occurs during the weak binding of the myosin head to actin...|$|R
40|$|Myosin generates {{force by}} a <b>rotation</b> of its <b>lever</b> arm. Crystal {{structures}} of myosin II indicate an unloaded working stroke of 10 – 12 nm, a range confirmed by recent x-ray interference experiments. However, when an actin filament, held between two weakly, optically trapped beads {{is made to}} interact with a single head of skeletal myosin, the bead displacements have often been reported as having a mean value of 5 – 6 nm, a value that is commonly interpreted as the working stroke. In general, the observed displacement {{is not expected to}} be equal to the working stroke because the kinetics of the stroke is necessarily strain-dependent: this effect biases the frequency of binding events to different actin sites so that displacements smaller than the working stroke are preferentially selected. Our analysis is tailored to current trap experiments, in which the time resolution is insufficient to detect prerigor states. If the preceding transitions are in equilibrium, the mean displacement is zero, contrary to observations in the presence of ATP. However, under ATP-cycling conditions, we find that the mean displacement is deflated to 0. 3 – 0. 7 of the true working stroke, depending on the equilibrium constant of the stroke and {{the rate at which the}} first myosin product state can detach from actin. The primary working stroke of processive myosin motors as measured by optical trapping is similarly uncertain...|$|R
40|$|Photolytic {{release of}} MgADP (25 - 300 microM) from caged ADP in permeabilized tonic (rabbit femoral artery-Rfa) and phasic (rabbit bladder-Rbl) smooth muscle in high-tension rigor state, {{in the absence}} of Ca(2 +), caused an {{exponential}} decline (approximately 1. 5 % in Rfa and approximately 6 % in Rbl) of rigor force, with the rate proportional to the liberated [MgADP]. The apparent second-order rate constant of MgADP binding was estimated as approximately 1. 0 x 10 (6) M(- 1) s(- 1) for both smooth muscles. In control experiments, designed to test the specificity of MgADP, photolysis of caged ADP {{in the absence of}} Mg(2 +) did not decrease rigor force in either smooth muscle, but rigor force decreased after photolytic release of Mg(2 +) in the presence of ADP. The effects of photolysis of caged ADP were similar in smooth muscles containing thiophosphorylated or non-phosphorylated regulatory myosin light chains. Stretching or releasing (within range of 0. 1 - 1. 2 % of initial Ca(2 +) -activated force) did not affect the rate or relative amplitude of the force decrease. The effect of additions of MgADP to rigor cross-bridges could result from <b>rotation</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm of smooth muscle myosin, but this need not imply that ADP-release is a significant force-producing step of the physiological cross-bridge cycle...|$|R
5000|$|Muscle {{contraction}} {{is caused}} by the sliding action of the thick filaments over the thin filaments of the myofibril. Myosin is a major component of thick filaments and exists as a hexamer of 2 heavy chains, 2 alkali light chains, and 2 regulatory light chains. The heavy chain can be subdivided into the N-terminal globular head and the C-terminal coiled-coil rod-like tail, although some forms have a globular region in their C-terminal. There are many cell-specific isoforms of myosin heavy chains, coded for by a multi-gene family. Myosin interacts with actin to convert chemical energy, in the form of ATP, to mechanical energy. The 3-D structure of the head portion of myosin has been determined [...] and a model for actin-myosin complex has been constructed. The globular head is well conserved, and is key to contraction. Muscle contraction results from an attachment-detachment cycle between the myosin heads extending from myosin filaments and the sites on actin filaments. The myosin head first attaches to actin together with the products of ATP hydrolysis, performs a power stroke associated with release of hydrolysis products, and detaches from actin upon binding with new ATP. The detached myosin head then hydrolyses ATP, and performs a recovery stroke to restore its initial position. The strokes have been suggested to result from <b>rotation</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm domain around the converter domain, while the catalytic domain remains rigid.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSlant is {{the degree}} to which a surface recedes or slopes away from the {{observer}} about the horizontal axis. The perception of surface slant may be derived from static monocular cues, including linear perspective and foreshortening, applied to single shapes or to multi-element textures. It is still unclear the extent to which color vision can use these cues to determine slant in the absence of achromatic contrast. Although previous demonstrations have shown that some pictures and images may lose their depth when presented at isoluminance, this has not been tested systematically using stimuli within the spatio-temporal passband of color vision. Here we test whether the foreshortening cue from surface compression (change in the ratio of width to length) can induce slant perception for single shapes for both color and luminance vision. We use radial frequency patterns with narrowband spatio-temporal properties. In the first experiment, both a manual task (<b>lever</b> <b>rotation)</b> and a visual task (line rotation) are used as metrics to measure the perception of slant for achromatic, red–green isoluminant and S-cone isolating stimuli. In the second experiment, we measure slant discrimination thresholds as a function of depicted slant in a 2 AFC paradigm and find similar thresholds for chromatic and achromatic stimuli. We conclude that both color and luminance vision can use the foreshortening of a single surface to perceive slant, with performances similar to those obtained using other strong cues for slant, such as texture. This has implications for the role of color in monocular 3 D vision, and the cortical organization used in 3 D object perception...|$|R
40|$|Myosin II, the myosin {{which has}} {{provided}} the most biochemical and structural data, is dimeric consisting of a long coiled-coil region with the motor domain flexibly attached to the N-terminal end of the coiled-coil. The motor domain (subfragment 1, S 1, or cross-bridge) is obtained by proteolytic cleavage of myosin. S 1 is a minimal model for the transport of actin filaments by myosin. S 1 contains the ATPase, the actin-binding site which is regulated by ATP binding, and a long lever arm, which moves actin past myosin by a swinging motion. The lever arm is buttressed by two calmodulin-like light chains. X-ray crystallography of S 1 and S 1 prepared without the lever arm shows that {{the backbone of the}} molecule is a seven-stranded β-sheet. The active site is very similar to the G-proteins and contains a P-loop and switch 1 and switch 2 elements. Moreover,the motor domain can be found in three conformations that correspond with three of the four states predicted by the Lymn-Taylor cross-bridge cycle. The <b>rotation</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm (power stroke) is coupled to changes in the relative positions of switch 2 and the P-loop after ATP binding. This rotation is reversed on products release (the power stroke). The movement of switch 1, which accompanies ATP binding, is coupled with an opening or closing of a cleft in the actin-binding site, which leads to large changes in the actin affinity. Myosin V yields crystallographic data on the strong actin-binding form of the cross-bridge. Strong binding to actin is accompanied by a bending of the central β-sheet, which enables products release and hence induces the power stroke. All myosins probably use the same mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the major}} {{structural}} transitions in molecular motors are often argued to couple to the binding of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the recovery stroke {{in the conventional}} myosin {{has been shown to}} be dependent on the hydrolysis of ATP. To obtain a clearer mechanistic picture for such "mechanochemical coupling" in myosin, equilibrium active-site simulations with explicit solvent have been carried out to probe the behavior of the motor domain as functions of the nucleotide chemical state and conformation of the converter/relay helix. In conjunction with previous studies of ATP hydrolysis with different active-site conformations and normal mode analysis of structural flexibility, the results help establish an energetics-based framework for understanding the mechanochemical coupling. It is proposed that the activation of hydrolysis does not require the <b>rotation</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm per se, but the two processes are tightly coordinated because both strongly couple to the open/close transition of the active site. The underlying picture involves shifts in the dominant population of different structural motifs as a consequence of changes elsewhere in the motor domain. The contribution of this work and the accompanying paper [] is to propose the actual mechanism behind these "population shifts" and residues that play important roles in the process. It is suggested that structural flexibilities at both the small and large scales inherent to the motor domain make it possible to implement tight couplings between different structural motifs while maintaining small free-energy drops for processes that occur in the detached states, which is likely a feature shared among many molecular motors. The significantly different flexibility of the active site in different X-ray structures with variable level arm orientations supports the notation that external force sensed by the lever arm may transmit into the active site and influence the chemical steps (nucleotide hydrolysis and/or binding) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractElevated {{levels of}} {{phosphate}} (Pi) reduce isometric force, providing {{support for the}} notion that the release of Pi from myosin is closely associated with the generation of muscular force. Pi is thought to rebind to actomyosin in an ADP-bound state and reverse the force-generating steps, including the <b>rotation</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm (i. e., the powerstroke). Despite extensive study, this mechanism remains controversial, in part because it fails to explain the effects of Pi on isometric ATPase and unloaded shortening velocity. To gain new insight into this process, we determined the effect of Pi on the force-generating capacity of a small ensemble of myosin (∼ 12 myosin heads) using a three-bead laser trap assay. In the absence of Pi, myosin pulled the actin filament out of the laser trap an average distance of 54 ± 4  nm, translating into an average peak force of 1. 2 pN. By contrast, in the presence of 30  mM Pi, myosin generated only enough force to displace the actin filament by 13 ± 1  nm, generating just 0. 2 pN of force. The elevated Pi also caused a > 65 % reduction in binding-event lifetime, suggesting that Pi induces premature detachment from a strongly bound state. Definitive evidence of a Pi-induced powerstroke reversal was not observed, therefore we determined if a branched kinetic model in which Pi induces detachment from a strongly bound, postpowerstroke state could explain these observations. The model was able to accurately reproduce not only the data presented here, but also the effects of Pi on both isometric ATPase in muscle fibers and actin filament velocity in a motility assay. The ability of the model to capture the findings presented here as well as previous findings suggests that Pi-induced inhibition of force may proceed along a kinetic pathway different from that of force generation...|$|R

Most myosins move towards the barbed (+) end of actin filaments, but recent studies have established that at least one member of the family, myosin VI, moves towards the pointed (−) end 5. The structural basis for reverse−direction movement has not been established. Two mechanisms for achieving reversal of myosin motility on the inherently polar actin filament have been suggested. On the basis of direct functional assays, electron microscopy and sequence analysis, Sweeney and co−workers proposed a model whereby reversal is achieved by rotating the lever arm in the opposite direction to conventional myosin lever arm movement 5 (Fig. 1).

40|$|The authors present two {{series of}} six and seven {{patients}} respectively, with a tumour of the proximal humerus, who were treated at two different institu-tions with a Delta type inverted shoulder prosthesis (DePuy International Ltd) after a Malawer type Ia or Ib resection. The rationale of using an inverted shoulder prosthe-sis is the aim {{to improve the}} functional outcome in rotator cuff deficient shoulders. This type of prosthe-sis medialises and lowers the centre of <b>rotation,</b> lengthens the <b>lever</b> arm of the deltoid muscle and improves its function. At one institution the resected part of the humerus was re-implanted after extracorporeal irradiation. It was fixed intramedullarly by cementation of the humeral prosthetic component to facilitate restora-tion of humeral height. This graft allowed reinsertion of muscles (deltoid, pectoralis, biceps) thus improv-ing power generation postoperatively. The largest glenosphere, size 42, was routinely used to recon-struct the glenoid; this theoretically improves the functional outcome (increased external rotation) and stability. At the other institution no graft augmentation was used except in one patient. The height of the humer-al prosthetic component was assessed after resection of the tumour by measurement of the resected part. The prosthetic stem was fitted in the remaining part of the humeral diaphysis, in three cases by cementa-tion and in three cases by press-fit (hydroxyapatite coating). Muscle balance was appreciated intra-opera-tively. Stability of the prosthesis was {{directly related to the}} level of resection. Both techniques resulted in a minimum active abduc-tion of 60 °, reaching 90 ° or more in most patients. When compared to other results in the literature, this is a major functional improvement.

40|$|If {{one could}} attach a {{fluorescent}} tag to a macromolecule and then measure its orientation in a cellular environment, then {{one would have}} a powerful tool by which to study conformational changes under physiological conditions. Apply this approach {{to the study of}} myosin and {{it should be possible to}} measure the movement that is thought to drive muscle contraction. This method is not new but until now it has yielded rather ambiguous results because the fluorophores themselves could move independently of the protein to which they were attached. By dint of much hard chemistry, Corrie et al. (Nature 430, 425 ? 430, 1999) have managed to fix both ends of the bifunctional fluorophore rhodamine to the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), thereby uniquely defining its orientation. They have then used the rhodamine-labeled RLC, in suitable muscle preparations that allow exchange of endogenous RLCs, to measure changes in the orientation of the myosin lever arm during contraction. Conformational changes in the myosin head regions (catalytic domain in red, heavy chain in blue, regulatory light chain in magenta and essential light chain in yellow) that bridge myosin and actin filaments (brown, gray, green) are thought to drive force generation and the relative sliding between these two filaments. Atomic resolution structural data, together with biochemical and physiological studies of the interaction between myosin, actin and ATP have led to the lever arm model for the force-generating conformational change in the myosin head. According to this model, the light chain binding domain changes orientation relative to the actin-bound catalytic domain during the ATPase cycle. Corrie et al. fixed rhodamine through iodoacetate groups to different locations on the regulatory light chain so as to measure changes in orientation of the lever arm during a contraction. In each case, the rhodamine has been fastened to pairs of cysteine groups engineered into the regulatory light chain at an appropriate distance apart, based on the known crystal structure, to provide a fixed attachment. The average orientpation of the fluorescence dipole is expected to be parallel to a line connecting the two cysteines. The three dimensional orientation of the RLC can be deduced from orientations of the bifunctional rhodamine dipoles, knowing the crystal structure coordinates of the residues where each rhodamine probe was attached. Shortening of a contracting muscle fiber results in a decrease in force, followed by a very rapid recovery that is thought to be due to the movement of the lever arms. Corrie and coworkers measured changes in orientation of the RLC region upon a muscle shortening of 3. 6 nm per crossbridge with a 50 mus time resolution. Measurement of the tilt and twist angle of the RLC with respect to the actin filament showed a rotation corresponding to a 3. 6 m average movement of the lever arm. Thus, the <b>rotation</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm was closely linked to the tension recovery. This result strongly favors the swinging lever arm model for muscle contraction. However, there are two caveats. The magnitude of the force recovery after the muscle shortening was modest, although this could be readily explained by the fact that the muscle fibers had been through a number of manipulations. Furthermore, the number of myosin crossbridges taking part in the contraction was small. A number of other experiments suggest that the number of attached crossbridges is small even in normal contracting muscle, but this issue is still rather contentious. Nevertheless, this recent study demonstrates a highly sensitive method for measuring the most basic movement in muscle in a physiological environment. This method should find wider applicability in many different areas of biology, where it will complement high-resolution structure...|$|R
