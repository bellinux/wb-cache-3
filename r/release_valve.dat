5|$|This river {{valve system}} {{was one of}} the first parts of the dam to be built when the dam project started in 1961, because its initial purpose was to divert the river while the dam was under construction. After that, it served various purposes, {{including}} as a possible emergency <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> Since the accident, DWR had implemented a standing order that prohibited the operation of the river outlet system and significantly limited access to the river valve chamber. Following the accident, DWR entered into a 2012 Agreement with CalOSHA to hire a third party expert to improve the safety of the River Valve Outlet System (RVOS) and make it operational again. In 2014, DWR embarked on an accelerated refurbishment program to respond to concerns about operational needs during the ongoing drought. The system was mostly refurbished and was used during 2014 and 2015 to meet Endangered Species Act temperature requirements for the Feather River. Some additional refurbishments were being made to portions of the RVOS and were expected to conclude in early 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E
5|$|Upfront, Vettel {{had reduced}} {{the gap between}} himself and Alonso to one second by lap50 as the pair {{continued}} to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit {{and drove to the}} pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered a cracked fuel tank pressure <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry, but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and got out of his car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen was off the racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.|$|E

25|$|On July 15, 1784 the {{brothers}} flew for 45 minutes from Saint-Cloud to Meudon with M. Collin-Hullin and Louis Philippe II, the Duke of Chartres in their elongated balloon. It was fitted with oars for propulsion and direction, but they proved useless. The {{absence of a}} gas <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> meant that the duke had to slash the ballonnet to prevent rupture when they reached an altitude of about 4,500 metres.|$|E
25|$|At 12:45 {{the crew}} opened gas <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> {{for three minutes}} to {{initiate}} descent; the hot balloon did not respond as planned and travel to 18,000 metres took more than two hours. At this altitude vertical speed levelled at a safe and steady one metre per second. At around 14,000 metres vertical speed increased, reaching two meters per second at 13,400 meters. Lifting force of the remaining hydrogen reduced to 1300–1400 kilograms, while the balloon weighed an estimated 2,120 kilograms.|$|E

50|$|Today's largest {{operators}} of trains equipped with vacuum brakes are the Indian Railways and Spoornet (South Africa), however {{there are also}} trains with air brakes and dual brakes in use. South African Railways (Spoornet) operates more than 1 000 electric multiple unit cars, which are fitted with air compressed brakes. The electro-vacuum system uses a 2 in train pipe and basic automatic vacuum brake system, {{with the addition of}} electrically-controlled application and <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> in each vehicle. The application and <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> greatly increase the rate of train pipe vacuum destruction and creation. This, in turn, greatly increases the speed of brake application and release. The performance of electro-vacuum brakes on SAR EMUs is equivalent to electro-pneumatic braked EMUs of a similar age.|$|R
25|$|Value-added Theory - Neil Smelser (1962) {{argues that}} {{collective}} behavior {{is actually a}} sort of <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> for built-up tension ("strain") within the social system, community, or group. If the proper determinants are present then collective behavior becomes inevitable. Conversely, {{if any of the}} key determinants are not present no collective behavior will occur unless and until the missing determinants fall into place. These are primarily social, although physical factors such as location and weather may also contribute to or hinder the development of collective behavior.|$|E
25|$|The GT-EX {{replaced}} the discontinued GT-R with a turbocharged engine, the L20ET. As {{installed in the}} recently renewed Nissan Cedric/Gloria, this {{had been the first}} turbo engine to power a Japanese production vehicle. One notable aspect of the turbo versions was that they were not intercooled and there was no form of blowoff valve, only an emergency pressure <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> As usual with Japanese cars of this period, there were four- or five-speed manuals and a three-speed automatic, with a column-shifted three-speed manual available on lower end cars and vans.|$|E
25|$|At 13:45 (or 1:45 PM) on December 1, 1783 Jacques Charles and the Robert {{brothers}} {{launched a}} new manned balloon from the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris. Jacques Charles was accompanied by Nicolas-Louis Robert as co-pilot of the 380-cubic-metre, hydrogen-filled balloon. The envelope was fitted with a hydrogen <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> and {{was covered with a}} net from which the basket was suspended. Sand ballast was used to control altitude. They ascended to a height of about 1,800 feet (550 m) and landed at sunset in Nesles-la-Vallée after a 2-hour 5 minute flight covering 36km. The chasers on horseback, who were led by the Duc de Chartres, held down the craft while both Charles and Nicolas-Louis alighted.|$|E

25|$|Two {{schools of}} thought {{developed}} about {{the cause of the}} crash. One theory is that the gas cells over-expanded as the ship rose, due to Lansdowne’s decision to remove the 10 automatic <b>release</b> <b>valves,</b> and that the expanding cells damaged the framework of the airship and led to its structural failure.|$|R
5000|$|Flood/Erosion Control: During heavy rains, the Wolf’s {{floodplain}} {{and wetlands}} temporarily store floodwaters. When these are filled in for development, the river loses these natural <b>release</b> <b>valves,</b> causing increases in river velocity and flood height. Without an adequate floodplain, floodwaters and the erosion caused by them threaten property, transportation, and lives.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{excessive}} pressure build-up in the hydraulic power network, a <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> was fitted beside the main hall of the powerhouse. A tall water fountain, the Jet d'Eau, was ejected by the device whenever it was activated. This happened typically at end of work when the factories switched off the machines one at the time, so that the pressure in the system was hard to control and the supply of pressurized water was difficult {{to adapt to the}} real demand. The tall fountain was visible from a long distance and became the landmark of the city. In 1891 it was moved to the current location in the lake where it is operated {{for the sole purpose of}} a tourist attraction without any other function.|$|E
25|$|The {{triple valve}} is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: Charging air into an air tank ready to be used, applying the brakes, and releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder, the reservoir charging valve, and the brake cylinder <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> When he soon improved the device by removing the poppet valve action, these three components became the piston valve, the slide valve, and the graduating valve.|$|E
25|$|Rolex {{produced}} specific models {{suitable for}} the extremes of deep-sea diving, caving, mountain climbing, polar exploration, and aviation. Early sports models included the Rolex Submariner (1953) and the Rolex Oyster Perpetual Date Sea Dweller. The latter watch has a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve,</b> co-invented with Swiss watchmaker Doxa, to release helium gas build-up during decompression. The Explorer (1953) and Explorer II (1971) were developed specifically for explorers who would navigate rough terrain, such as the world-famous Mount Everest expeditions. Another iconic model is the Rolex GMT Master (1954), originally developed {{at the request of}} Pan Am Airways to provide its crews with a dual time watch {{that could be used to}} display GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), which was the international time standard for aviation at that time and was needed for Astronavigation during longer flights.|$|E

25|$|The {{pressure}} regulator adjusts and controls the gas {{pressure in the}} cuff bladder. Older, non-computerized tourniquet systems utilize valves that attempt to respond mechanically to changes in pressure. For example, if pressure in the cuff bladder falls, a valve may open to allow more gas to enter the regulator from the gas source; if pressure exceeds a certain level, the pressure may force a <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> to open and expel gas into the environment. Sometimes, the pressure levels at which these two valves turn on and off are quite different and cuff pressure may fluctuate within a certain range {{above and below the}} selected pressure. Due to the sensitive mechanical components of these systems, {{it is very important to}} follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding frequent testing, and calibration and to perform these checks before each surgical procedure as recommended. In general, tourniquet systems with mechanical regulators are now considered to be inaccurate, unreliable, and are not suitable for incorporation with modern tourniquet safety features.|$|E
500|$|Project manager Erik Johnson said Valve's {{goal for}} Portal 2 {{was to find}} a way to [...] "re-surprise" [...] players, which he {{considered}} a [...] "pretty terrifying" [...] prospect. In March 2011, one month before the game's <b>release,</b> <b>Valve</b> president Gabe Newell called Portal 2 [...] "the best game we've ever done." [...] After Portal 2s release, Geoff Keighley wrote that according to Newell, [...] "Portal 2 will probably be Valve's last game with an isolated single-player experience". Keighley later stated that the use of the word [...] "probably" [...] suggests that [...] "this could change." [...] Newell said that Valve is not [...] "giving up on single-player at all", but intends to include more social features on top of the single player experience, akin to the cooperative mode in Portal 2.|$|E
500|$|While the Windows and Xbox 360 {{versions}} of The Orange Box were developed {{and published by}} Valve, {{the development of the}} PlayStation 3 port was outsourced to Electronic Arts. In an interview with Edge magazine before the game's <b>release,</b> <b>Valve</b> co-founder Gabe Newell commented, [...] "I think the people who have The Orange Box on the PS3 are going to be happy with their game experience. We've done the PC and 360 versions here and EA has a team doing the PS3 version– and they'll make the PS3 version a good product; EA got the job done in putting {{a lot of people with}} PS3 experience on the project. But I think it's harder to get it to the same standard as the 360 and PC versions". Despite this, he noted that Valve will probably handle PlayStation 3 {{versions of}} its products in the future.|$|E
