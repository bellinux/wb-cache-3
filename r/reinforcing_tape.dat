40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that selective reinforcement offers the potential to significantly improve the performance of metallic structures for aerospace applications. Applying high-strength, high-stiffness fibers to the high-stress regions of aluminum-based structures can increase the structural load-carrying capability and inhibit fatigue crack initiation and growth. This paper discusses an investigation into potential methods for applying reinforcing fibers onto the surface of aluminum and aluminum-lithium plate. Commercially-available alumina-fiber reinforced aluminum alloy tapes were used as the reinforcing material. Vacuum hot pressing was used to bond the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>tape</b> to aluminum alloy 2219 and aluminum-lithium alloy 2195 base plates. Static and cyclic three-point bend testing and metallurgical analysis were used to evaluate the enhancement of mechanical performance and the integrity of the bond between the tape and the base plate. The tests demonstrated an increase in specific bending stiffness. In addition, no issues with debonding of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>tape</b> from the base plate during bend testing were observed. The increase in specific stiffness indicates that selectively-reinforced structures could be designed with the same performance capabilities as a conventional unreinforced structure but with lower mass...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The joint process between {{tapes of}} coated con-ductors is a {{critical}} issue for most applications of high tem-perature superconductors (HTSs). In this work several lap joints using different techniques were prepared for three dif-ferent types of commercially available YBCO-coated con-ductor tapes, with and without copper stabilizer or stain-less steel reinforcement layers.

The electrical resistance, the critical current, and the n-index of the joints were calculated from the electric field vs. current (E × I) characteristic curves under DC current tests and by further subjecting the same samples to tensile stresses.

40|$|The project aims the {{automatic}} production of rotational symmetrical components of thermoplastic fiber reinforced materials {{for use of}} three-dimensional structural components. Concepts for positioning of endless fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>tapes,</b> or fiber placement are investigated. <b>Tapes</b> <b>reinforced</b> with carbon fiber or fiber glass are immersed in a polymer matrix system and are rolled up in coils. A tape-laying unit which includes all the necessary functions for handling the prepreg tape was developed. The tape-laying unit is mounted onto a robot system. This creates the tape-laying movements. In order to produce a highly compact fiber reinforced component via laser-assisted tape-laying, the tapes are deposited, layer by layer, into a mold. During the process, a laser melts the upper side of the fresh tape and the lower side of the previously deposited tape. The tapes are then deposited side by side, without gaps, and compressed by a pressure roller {{in order to make}} the fiber reinforced component compact. The first results of trials show that the carbon fiber best absorbs radiation from a high-performance diode laser. In the course of future development work, a system must be designed to secure the first tape to the mold. Subsequent layers can then be melted onto the bottom layer. This innovative machining process will be able to flexibly and cost effectively produce three-dimensional lightweight components. The project ultimately aims to introduce fiber reinforced materials into new fields of industry and technology. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{shows the}} process of the virtual {{production}} development of the mechanical connection between the top leaf of a dual composite leaf spring system to a shackle using finite element methods. The commercial FEA package MSC/MARC has been used for the analysis. In the original design the joint was based on a closed eye-end. Full scale testing results showed that this configuration achieved the vertical proof load of 150 kN and 1 million cycles of fatigue load. However, a problem with delamination occurred at the interface between the fibres going around the eye and the main leaf body. To overcome this problem, a second design was tried using transverse bandages of woven glass fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>tape</b> to wrap the section that is prone to delaminate. In this case, the maximum interlaminar shear stress was reduced by a certain amount but it was still higher than the material’s shear strength. Based on the fact that, even with delamination, the top leaf spring still sustained the maximum static and fatigue loads required, the third design was proposed with an open eye-end, eliminating altogether the interface where the maximum shear stress occurs. The maximum shear stress predicted by FEA is reduced significantly and a safety factor of around 2 has been obtained. Thus, a successful and safe design has been achieved. 1...|$|R

40|$|The joint process between {{tapes of}} coated {{conductors}} {{is a critical}} issue for {{the most of the}} applications of high temperature superconductors (HTS). Using different fabrication techniques joints of YBCO coated superconductors were prepared and characterized through electrical measurements. For soldering material low melting point eutectic alloys, such as In-Sn (m. p. 116 degrees C) and Sn-Pb (m. p. 189 degrees C) were selected to prepare lap joints with effective length between 1 to 20 cm. The splice resistance and the critical current of the joints were evaluated by I-V curve measurements with the maximum current strength above the critical current, in order to evaluate the degree of degradation for each joint method. Pressed lap joints prepared with tapes without external reinforcement presented low resistance lap joint nevertheless some critical current degradation occurs when strong pressing is applied. When mechanical pressure is applied during the soldering process we can reduce the thickness of the solder alloy and a residual resistance arises from contributions of high resistivity matrix and external reinforcement. The lap joints for <b>reinforced</b> <b>tape</b> were prepared using two methods: the first, using ""as-supplied"" tape and the other after reinforcement-removal; in the latter case, the tapes were resoldered using Sn-Pb alloy.

40|$|Laser-assisted tape {{placement}} is {{an attractive}} manufacturing technology for the aerospace industry as it combines high productivity with low energy consumption. It comprises the automated deposition of fiber <b>reinforced</b> thermoplastic <b>tapes</b> to incrementally build up a structure. The process {{can also be used}} to tailor the properties of conventionally manufactured woven fabric reinforced components by locally reinforcing these with unidirectionally <b>reinforced</b> <b>tapes.</b> This thesis focuses on the weld strength between the tape and the woven fabric reinforced component. The principal objective is to develop an in situ processing strategy, combining high productivity and energy efﬁciency with high weld strength. For this purpose, the important bonding mechanisms, processing parameters and material properties are identiﬁed through a combination of experimental work and physical modeling. The interlaminar bonding process comprises the development of intimate contact followed by the interdiffusion of polymer chains. Both mechanisms depend strongly on the interface temperature. A thermal process model is, therefore, proposed speciﬁcally taking into account the optical aspects of laser heating. The model is validated experimentally. Based on the developed model, the important processing paramaters and material properties are identiﬁed. A mandrel peel test is introduced to quantify the interfacial fracture toughness between the tape and the laminate. The applicability and validity of the method is successfully demonstrated by comparing it to standardized fracture mechanics tests. The interfacial fracture toughness does not only depend on the degree of interlaminar bonding. The crystallinity and structural morphology of the interface also play an important role. This is demonstrated by a comparison between the (fast) tape placement process and a (slow) press-molding process. The tape-placed specimens outperform the press-molded specimens in terms of fracture toughness by almost a factor of two. This is attributed to the high cooling rates and short bonding time during the tape placement process. The former results in a low crystallinity, while the latter prevents the migration of tape fibers into the resin pockets of the laminate and thereby minimizes the fiber–fiber contact. Both the low crystallinity and the presence of resin pockets improve the interfacial fracture toughness. Finally, a processing strategy is proposed, which maximizes productivity and energy efﬁciency. The strategy involves the distribution of all laser power to the tape. Although the proposed strategy should be tested in practice, the work in this thesis suggests that an excellent weld strength will be achieved...|$|R

The components are produced independently of size and load directions by placing single unidirectional fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>tapes</b> automatically. Moreover, very large component dimensions enable a reduction of joining processes. In comparison to the thermoset tape placement, additional potentials can be set up through the usage of thermoplastic semi-finished materials, as beside the high degree of integration and the defined laminate construction less material specific problems and a non-autoclave production can be realized. This thesis follows an all-embracing analyses and development of the thermoplastic tape placement process to provide knowledge to overcome the deficits concerning semi-finished materials, systems engineering and available models for the process description. First, the process is described and differentiated. Within the scope of a strategic process analyses, the potentials and strength of this process are worked out. Through a succeeding operational process analyses, the process is pictured in detail and further developments of the process and the control are made possible. All aspects of the process in terms of quality of the semi-finished material, systems engineering, process control, and quality assurance are considered for the process development. Innovative concepts to solve the first layer problem and a new tape placement head are worked out. A new model is developed to support strategic decisions on basis of component specific cycle times. A measure for the component shape complexity is derived and integrated into a continuous approach. The model is based on the process physics and can be applied to any component without a need for empiric data. Finally, new process potentials are presented through a combination of thermoforming and thermoplastic tape placement. (orig.)
