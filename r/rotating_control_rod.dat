40|$|Abstract—In this research, axially {{variable}} strength <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> (AVSCRs) {{are developed}} {{to solve the}} problems related to the axial power distribution of a reactor during power maneuvering of pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> are classified into two types: multipurpose <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> and regulating <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b> Two multipurpose <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> banks (AVSCR 1, AVSCR 2) are newly developed; conventional axially uniform strength <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> are adopted as regulating <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> banks to minimize the design change. The newly developed AVSCRs are axially three-sectioned and their worth shapes are optimized to obtain appropriate moving characteristics related to the variation of the axial offset (AO) according to the motion of the AVSCRs. The operation strategy for the power maneuvering is developed in consideration of the moving characteristics of the AVSCRs. This strategy consists of simple logics, and no use of reactivity compen-sation by boron is considered. Finally, the AVSCRs are applied to the power maneuvering with a typical 100 - 50 - 100 %, 2 - 6 - 2 - 14 h pattern of daily load-follow for all burn-up state of the core. From the application results, it is shown that the use of AVSCRs makes it possible to regulate AO within the target band during the power maneuvering with only <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b> Consequently, power maneuvering is accomplished without reactivity compensation by a change in boron concentration, and the AVSCRs can cover the entire burn-up states of the reactor core.

40|$|Several BWR {{utilities}} are adopting practices {{for determining the}} state of <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> based on the neutron sensitive LPRM and gamma sensitive TIP measurement systems of the nuclear reactor core. This method is in this study evaluated by quantitatively analyzing the detector sensitivity to several material and geometrical distortions in the detector vicinity, using the Los Alamos National Laboratory stochastic Monte Carlo code MCNP 5 and the Westinghouse 3 D core simulator POLCA 7. These results are used {{to determine whether or}} not there are potential pitfalls that need to be considered when applying the in-core detector based diagnostic methods to determine the state of <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b> This study also addresses the utility concern about shutdown margin deterioration due to potential loss of neutron absorbing material from <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b> It is found that indication of potential <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> leakage by means of the LPRM and the gamma TIP probe detector systems is feasible, provided that both detector systems show similar deviations that correspond to the potential loss of neutron absorbing material from the <b>control</b> <b>rod.</b> Furthermore, it is possible to correlate the observed detector signaldeviation to the magnitude of the distortion.

Herein, a passive in-core cooling system is proposed to delay the time of fuel melting and to enhance the safety of nuclear power plants during station blackout accidents. The passive in-core cooling system consist of a hydraulic <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> drive mechanism and a hybrid <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> assembly that combines the heat pipes with the <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b> To achieve the unique features of its system, hydraulic <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> drive mechanism is designed using hybrid <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> located inside the reactor vessel. The study deals with the test of a 4 -finger hydraulic-rod control system {{as one of the}} components of the passive in-core cooling system. The experimental study focuses on the force-induced system based on the pressure differential between the grooved cylinders, which controls the elevation of the upper cylinder, i. e., the hybrid <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> assembly. As a result, the stable inlet flow and position were found at each step, yielding a well predicted holding flow, in accordance to the force balance equation. In withdrawal steps, reduced inlet flow was not observed, but reduced pressure was observed due to the narrow gap between the cylinders during the lift delay condition. Drop test results yield good agreement with those predicted by the simple model, resulting in percentage errors within ± 15 %.

50|$|Positioning (withdrawing or inserting) <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> is {{the normal}} method for {{controlling}} power when starting up a BWR. As <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> are withdrawn, neutron absorption decreases {{in the control}} material and increases in the fuel, so reactor power increases. As <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> are inserted, neutron absorption increases in the control material and decreases in the fuel, so reactor power decreases. Differently from the PWR, in a BWR the <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> (boron carbide plates) are inserted from below to give a more homogeneous distribution of the power: in the upper side {{the density of the}} water is lower due to vapour formation, making the neutron moderation less efficient and the fission probability lower.

To learn more, the  10 B depletion has been simulated for each absorber hole in the uppermost node usingthe stochastic Monte Carlo 3 D simulation code MCNP as well as an MCNP- based 2 D-depletion code (McScram). It was found that the 10 B depletion is significantly higher for the uppermost absorberpins than the node average.
