50|$|Coria {{also has}} one of the strongest, if not the best return game in the history of men's tennis, {{currently}} ranked No. 1 for 3 of the 4 all-time leaderboards regarding returns on all surfaces: for break point conversion percentage at 45.71%, ahead of Rafael Nadal (45.15%), and Sergi Bruguera (44.95%); for first serve <b>return</b> <b>points</b> won percentage at 36.05%, ahead of Nadal (34.05%), and David Ferrer (33.65%); for return games won percentage at 35.26%, ahead of Nadal (33.35%) and Novak Djokovic (32.23%). His incredibly strong return game is sometimes enough to allow him to win matches despite his service yips. The only leaderboard about return that Coria did not rank No. 1 at is the second serve <b>return</b> <b>points</b> won, where he is currently ranked 13th.|$|R

5000|$|Strictly speaking, {{water that}} is {{discharged}} into sewer, or directly to the environment is not wasted or lost. It remains within the hydrologic cycle and returns to land surface and surface water bodies as precipitation. However, {{in many cases the}} source of the water is at a significant distance from the <b>return</b> <b>point</b> and may be in a different catchment. The separation between extraction point and <b>return</b> <b>point</b> can represent significant environmental degradation in the watercourse and riparian strip. What is [...] "wasted" [...] is community's supply of water that was captured, stored, transported and treated to drinking quality standards. Efficient use of water saves the expense of water supply provision and leaves more fresh water in lakes, rivers and aquifers for other users and also for supporting ecosystems. Two concepts that are closely related to water wasting are [...] "water-use efficiency" [...] and [...] "water conservation." ...|$|E
50|$|Maria Island National Park {{includes}} a marine area which stretches from Fossil Bay {{on the northern}} coast of the island to <b>Return</b> <b>Point</b> on the west coast, and extends up to a kilometre offshore. South-west of the Painted Cliffs and just outside the marine section of the park, a disused coastal trader was sunk in 2007 to form a dive reef.

5000|$|Fulmar Bay (...) is a bay 1 nmi km wide between Moreton Point and <b>Return</b> <b>Point</b> at {{the west}} end of Coronation Island, in the South Orkney Islands. It was first sighted and roughly charted by Captain George Powell and Captain Nathaniel Palmer on their joint cruise in December 1821. It was {{surveyed}} in 1933 by Discovery Investigations personnel, and so named in 1954 by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee because large numbers of Antarctic Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialoides) nest in this area.|$|E

40|$|The {{consistency}} of positive past returns and tax-loss selling significantly affects {{the relation between}} past returns and the cross-section of expected returns. Analysis of these additional effects across stock characteristics, seasons, and tax regimes provides clues about the sources of temporal relations in stock <b>returns,</b> <b>pointing</b> to potential explanations for this relation. A parsimonious trading rule generates surprisingly large economic returns despite controls for confounding sources of return premia, microstructure effects, and data snooping biases...|$|R

5000|$|Peter Ritchie {{also notes}} that, in principle, {{even a single}} [...] right before the [...] in a {{function}} constitutes {{a violation of the}} single-exit principle, but argues that Dijkstra's rules were written in a time before exception handling became a paradigm in programming languages, so he proposes to allow any number of throw points in addition to a single <b>return</b> <b>point.</b> He notes that solutions which wrap exceptions for the sake of creating a single-exit have higher nesting depth and thus are more difficult to comprehend, and even accuses those who propose to apply such solutions to programming languages which support exceptions of engaging in cargo cult thinking.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we study}} the dynamics, fractal {{geometry}} and the topology of the Julia {{set of functions}} in the family H which is a set in the class S, the Speiser class of entire transcendental functions which have only finitely many singular values. One {{can think of a}} function from H as a generalized expanding function from the cosh family. We shall build a version of thermodynamic formalism for functions in H and we shall show among others, the existence and uniqueness of a conformal measure. Then we prove a Bowen's type formula, i. e. we show that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of <b>returning</b> <b>points,</b> is the unique zero of the pressure function. We shall also study conjugacies in the family H, perturbation of functions in the family and related dynamical properties. We define Perron-Frobenius operators for some functions naturally associated with functions in the family H and then, using fundamental properties of these operators, we shall prove the important result that the Hausdorff dimension of the subset of <b>returning</b> <b>points</b> depends analytically on the parameter taken from a small open subset of the n-dimensional parameter space...|$|R
