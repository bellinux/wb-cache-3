Representative peak values for the v"= 0 progression in the red and green-blue regions are 2. 59 <b>A</b> <b>sup</b> 2 (average value) and 11. 77 <b>A</b> <b>sup</b> 2 (T sub ave= 624 K).

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>sup</b> (supremum) of X is a least {{upper bound}} on X, namely an upper bound on X that is less or equal to every upper bound on X. Dually an inf (infimum) of X is a {{greatest}} lower bound on X. The sup of x and y always exists in the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra, being x∨y, and likewise their inf exists, namely x∧y. The empty sup is 0 (the bottom element) and the empty inf is 1 (top). It follows that every finite set has both <b>a</b> <b>sup</b> and <b>an</b> inf. Infinite subsets of a Boolean algebra {{may or may not}} have <b>a</b> <b>sup</b> and/or <b>an</b> inf; in a power set algebra they always do.|$|R

The reaction plane was determined on an event by event by event basis and angular distribution of <b>ă.</b> <b>sup.</b> o. /sup. and. eta. mesons was reconstructed.

40|$|During {{the process}} of solving a {{mathematical}} model numerically, {{there is often a}} need to operate on a vector v by an operator which can be expressed as f(A) while A is NxN matrix (ex: exp(A), sin(A), <b>A</b> <b>sup</b> - 1). Except for very simple matrices, it is impractical to construct the matrix f(A) explicitly. Usually an approximation to it is used. In the present research, an algorithm is developed which uses a polynomial approximation to f(A). It is reduced to a problem of approximating f(z) by a polynomial in z while z belongs to the domain D in the complex plane which includes all the eigenvalues of A. This problem of approximation is approached by interpolating the function f(z) in a certain set of points which is known to have some maximal properties. The approximation thus achieved is almost best. Implementing the algorithm to some practical problem is described. Since a solution to a linear system Ax = b is x= <b>A</b> <b>sup</b> - 1 b, an iterative solution to it can be regarded as a polynomial approximation to f(A) = <b>A</b> <b>sup</b> - 1. Implementing the algorithm in this case is also described...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} murine {{recombinant}} gamma interferon (IFN) or lymphokines {{to enhance the}} fungicidal activity of murine pulmonary macrophages (PuM) was studied in in vitro. PuM monolayers were incubated overnight with IFN, lymph node cells (LNC) plus concanavalin A, supernatants from Con A stimulated LNC or spleen cell cultures (Con <b>A</b> <b>Sup),</b> or tissue culture medium (TCM) +/- Con A (5 micrograms/ml) or +/- lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 ng to 10 micrograms/ml). After treatment, culture fluids were removed and PuM were challenged for 4 h with the yeast-form Blastomyces dermatitidis or 2 h with Candida albicans. Inoculum colony forming units (CFU) of B. dermatitidis were significantly reduced by PuM treated with 1000 U/ml of IFN (25 +/- 3 %), Con <b>A</b> <b>Sup</b> (25 +/- 3 %) or LNC plus Con A (37 - 44 %), but not by TCM, ConA or LPS. Candida albicans was killed by PuM treated with Con <b>A</b> <b>Sup</b> (33 +/- 8 %) or LNC plus Con A (30 - 43 %), but not by TCM, Con A, or LPS, and the activity of Con <b>A</b> <b>Sup</b> was neutralized by anti-IFN antibody. Candida albicans was not significantly killed by PuM treated with IFN doses ranging from 1 to 10 (5) U/ml; nor did addition of LPS to IFN, or prolonged (3 day) treatment with IFN, result in significant killing of C. albicans by PuM. However, IFN (100 U/ml) could activate resident peritoneal macrophages for significant candidacidal activity (63 %). These data indicate that PuM can be activated for fungicidal activity, and that PuM differ from resident peritoneal macrophages with regard to induction of candidacidal activity by recombinant gamma-IFN...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} effects of mediators derived form activated spleen cells on macrophage Ia-antigen expression and function. Incubation of adherent thioglycollate-induced murine peritoneal macrophages(> 90 % Ia-) with concanavalin A (Con A) - stimulated spleen cell supernate (Con <b>A</b> <b>sup)</b> resulted in <b>a</b> dose- dependent increase in the percentage of Ia-containing (Ia+) phagocytic cells, as detected by antiserum-and-complement-mediated cytotoxicity. The Ia-antigen expression of macrophages incubated with unstimulated spleen cell supernate supplemented with Con <b>A</b> (Control <b>sup)</b> declined. Pretreatment of the macrophages with anti-Ia and complement before addition of the Con <b>A</b> <b>sup</b> did not inhibit subsequent Ia-antigen expression, suggesting that Ia- macropohages were converted to Ia+ cells. These findings were not a result of adsorption of soluble Ia- antigen from the Con <b>A</b> <b>sup,</b> because Ia-antigen expression was detected by an antiserum specific for the haplotype of the macrophages but not that of the allogeneic spleen cells from which the supernate was prepared. Con A sup-cultured macrophages also stimulated the proliferation of allogeneic spleen cells significantly better than Control sup-cultured macrophages in the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR). Pretreatment of Con A sup-cultured macrophages with anti-Ia and complement before addition of splenic responder cells abrogated their stimulatory capacity, indicating the Ia dependence of the MLR. We hypothesize that regulatory lymphokine(s) can induce both the expression of the Ia+ phenotype by macrophages and the functional capability to stimulate the MLR, and that macrophages lose these capabilities in the absence of such mediator(s) ...|$|R
