5|$|Traditionally, the Treasury set {{interest}} rates. After {{reforms in}} 1992, officials held regular meetings and published minutes, {{but were not}} independent of government. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> feeling that political factors were clouding what should be purely economic judgements on monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|As {{his second}} {{administration}} began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland {{was unable to}} reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening {{the way for a}} Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{is one of}} {{thirteen}} nations to {{have participated in the}} Asian Baseball Championship since the tournament was first held in 1954. The last time they contested the championship was in 1993, as a result of joining the newly formed Baseball Confederation of Oceania. Though their best <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bronze medal in the 1975, the only teams to consistently finish ahead of Australia were Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei—the top three teams in Asia, and all in the top five in the world.|$|E
50|$|If the ellipse is {{rotated about}} its major axis, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> prolate (elongated) spheroid, {{shaped like a}}n American {{football}} or rugby ball. If the ellipse is rotated about its minor axis, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> oblate (flattened) spheroid, shaped like a lentil. If the generating ellipse <b>is</b> <b>a</b> circle, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sphere. A spheroid has circular symmetry.|$|R

5|$|Between Operations Trident and Python, and the Indian Air Force {{attacks on}} Karachi's fuel and {{ammunition}} depots, {{more than fifty}} percent of the total fuel requirement of the Karachi zone was reported to have been destroyed. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> crippling economic blow to Pakistan. The damage was estimated to be worth $3billion, with most of the oil reserves and ammunition warehouses and workshops destroyed. The Pakistan Air Force was also affected by the loss of fuel.|$|E
5|$|For the 1965 Formula One season, Rindt {{signed as}} a {{permanent}} driver with Cooper, paired with Bruce McLaren. He was not immediately successful as Cooper, formerly a top team, were struggling at the time. In his first race, the 1965 South African Grand Prix, he developed transistor trouble; the damage was initially repaired but the problem recurred and Rindt had to retire from the race. His best <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fourth place at the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. He ended the season with four points, 13th in the championship.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 a {{breakthrough}} in creating a strong light aluminium steel alloy which might be suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology. Adding small amounts of nickel was found to result in precipitation as nano particles of brittle B2 intermetallic compounds which had previously resulted in weakness. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> cheap strong light steel alloy—nearly as strong as titanium at 10% of the cost—which is slated for trial production at industrial scale by POSCO, a Korean steelmaker.|$|E

5|$|In April 2001, San Marino gained {{their first}} ever away point, drawing 1–1 with Latvia in Riga. The team ended the 2002 World Cup {{qualifying}} {{group with a}} new best of three goals, though one of these came in a 10–1 defeat by Belgium. In Euro 2004 qualifying San Marino lost all eight matches, failing to score. The closest <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 1–0 home defeat by Latvia, with the winner scored in the last minute.|$|E
5|$|Mike Gatting was the {{incumbent}} England captain for the First Test at Trent Bridge. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> draw, with Graham Gooch and David Gower helping England {{to save the}} game {{from a position of}} weakness, after conceding a sizeable first-innings lead to the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the first}} series had aired {{and it was}} {{realised}} that the overall approach was working well, the creative team built on and significantly expanded {{the scope of the}} comedy elements for the second.

50|$|Diego Ruiz Asín (born June 25, 1977) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Spanish {{cross-country}} skier who has {{competed in}} the World Cup since 1998. Ruiz competed at three Winter Olympics (1998, 2006, and 2010) and in four FIS Nordic World Ski Championships from 2003 to 2009. His best Olympic <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 23rd place in the 50 km event in 2006. His best World Championships <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 17th place at the 50 km event in Oberstdorf in 2005, and his best World Cup <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> 18th place at a 15 km event in Changchun in 2007.|$|R

5|$|Special {{consideration}} {{was given}} during filming {{to allow for}} integration of the planned special effects. Television monitors standing in for computer displays were specially calibrated so that their refresh rate {{did not result in}} banding on film. Due to a loss of resolution and quality resulting from rephotographing an element in an optical printer, live action sequences for effects were shot in 65mm or VistaVision formats to compensate. When the larger prints were reduced through an anamorphic lens on the printer, the <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Panavision composite.|$|E
5|$|Stanford won all its 1926 games, {{crushing}} California 41–7 and narrowly defeating USC 13–12. Warner's {{team was}} invited to the Rose Bowl to play Alabama. Like the game against the Fighting Irish, Stanford dominated but the <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 7–7 tie. After the game, both teams were recognized as national champions {{by a number of}} publications.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Standard, as the {{encounter}} {{came to be}} called, was a defeat for the Scots. Afterwards, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although the <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> defeat, it was {{not by any means}} decisive. David retained the bulk of his army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland as well as much of Northumberland.|$|E

5|$|The first {{parliamentary}} elections after independence were held on 27 February and 8 March 1958. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> victory for Abd al-Rahman's Umma Party, which won 63 of the 173 seats. The Southern Sudan Federal Party {{competed in the}} election, and won 40 of the 46 seats allocated to the southern provinces. The Federal party platform represented a serious challenge to the authorities. However, {{when it became clear}} that the party's demands for a federal structure would be ignored by the Constituent Assembly, on 16 June 1958 the southern MPs left parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{participants}} were vessels of the U.S. Navy's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron opposed by vessels of the Confederate Navy's Mosquito Fleet; {{the latter were}} supported by a shore-based battery of four guns at Cobb's Point (now called Cobb Point) near the southeastern border of the town. The battle {{was a part of}} the campaign in North Carolina that was led by Burnside and known as the Burnside Expedition. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Union victory, with Elizabeth City and its nearby waters in their possession and the Confederate fleet captured, sunk, or dispersed.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, the {{functions}} and composition of households started to change. This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of gunpowder to the field of warfare rendered the castle a less effective defence, and did away with the military function of the household. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> household more focused on comfort and luxury, and with a significantly larger proportion of women.|$|E

5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E
5|$|A silver boom {{occurred}} in England after {{the discovery of}} silver near Carlisle in 1133. Huge quantities of silver were produced from a semicircle of mines reaching across Cumberland, Durham and Northumberland – up to three to four tonnes of silver were mined each year, more than ten times the previous annual production across the whole of Europe. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> local economic boom and a major uplift to 12th-century royal finances. Tin mining was centred in Cornwall and Devon, exploiting alluvial deposits and governed by the special Stannary Courts and Parliaments. Tin formed a valuable export good, initially to Germany and then later in the 14th century to the Low Countries. Lead was usually mined as a by-product of mining for silver, with mines in Yorkshire, Durham and the north, {{as well as in}} Devon. Economically fragile, the lead mines usually survived as a result of being subsidised by silver production.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it gained}} recruits, the rising began {{to suffer from}} {{internal}} divisions, particularly between the Highlanders who made {{up the bulk of}} the forces and the Lowland nobles and officers who were their commanders. In early 1654, nine months into the revolt, Middleton, a Lowland officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester, arrived with a commission to command from Charles II. Despite objections from his followers, Glencairn surrendered control over his forces, which had now reached 3,500 foot and 1,500 horse. That evening Sir George Munro, Middleton's aide insulted Glencairn's forces and the <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> duel in which Munro was wounded. Glencairn was arrested. He would eventually be released and retire from the conflict. A series of other disputes and duels undermined the leadership of the campaign {{for the remainder of the}} rising.|$|E
