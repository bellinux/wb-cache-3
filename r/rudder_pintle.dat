5000|$|The voyage was {{not without}} {{difficulty}} and sailing through {{the aftermath of a}} gale caused conditions that saw th bow door start to [...] "peel" [...] externally, some engine troubles that caused a close-down on one side, one <b>rudder</b> <b>pintle</b> breaking, and the helm-wheel shake to pieces leaving only its steel skeleton. Eventually the vessel had to get towed to Sydney by the accompanying LSM, and attaching the towing bridle in heavy seas resulted in an accident that injured two of the six crew. This unhappy voyage ended with the vessel coming into Sydney Harbour with distress flags/balls hoisted, having to steer in a slow circle to port then a short burst of full astern, in an attempt to get it to dock alongside Clifton Gardens base. That the vessel was largely orange with rust by this time (and no longer bronze deep green) also did little to impress the official greeting party as news of the vessels mishaps had not been passed because of radio failure during the voyage. Despite such an eventful maiden voyage, that vessel was fixed in 4 Water Transport's own workshops and all faults repaired, leaving it to go into honourable service as shown below.|$|E
50|$|Not all {{ships are}} built to an ice class. Building a ship to an ice class {{means that the}} hull must be thicker, and more {{scantlings}} (aggregate of girders, beams, and bulkheads resulting in stronger structural integrity) must be in place. Sea chests (openings in the hull for seawater intake) {{may need to be}} arranged differently depending on the class. Sea bays may also be required to ensure that the sea chest does not become blocked with ice. Most of the stronger classes require several forms of rudder and propeller protection. Two <b>rudder</b> <b>pintles</b> are usually required, and strengthened propeller tips are often required in the stronger ice classes. More watertight bulkheads, in addition to those required by a ship's normal class, are usually required. In addition, heating arrangements for fuel tanks, ballast tanks, and other tanks vital to the ship's operation may also be required depending on the class.|$|R
5|$|The tugs {{took the}} hulk of the Temeraire in tow at 7:30 am on 5 September 1838, taking {{advantage}} of the beginning of the slack water. They had reached Greenhithe by 1:30 pm at the , where they anchored overnight. They resumed the journey at 8:30 am the following day, passing Woolwich and then Greenwich at noon. They reached Limehouse Reach shortly afterwards and brought her safely to Beatson's Wharf at 2 pm. The Temeraire was hauled up onto the mud, where she lay as she was slowly broken up. The final voyage was announced in a number of papers, and thousands of spectators came to see her towed up the Thames or laid up at Beatson's yard. The shipbreakers undertook a thorough dismantling, removing all the copper sheathing, <b>rudder</b> <b>pintles</b> and gudgeons, copper bolts, nails and other fastenings to be sold back to the Admiralty. The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture.|$|R
50|$|Carved {{images of}} the birlinn from the sixteenth century and earlier show the typical rigging: braces, {{forestay}} and backstay, shrouds (fore and aft), halyard and a parrel (a movable loop used to secure a yard or gaff to a mast). There is a <b>rudder</b> with <b>pintles</b> on the leading edge, inserted into gudgeons. It is possible that use was made of a wooden bowline or reaching spar (called a beitass by the Norse). This was used to push the {{luff of the sail}} out into the wind.|$|R
5000|$|Wooden-hulled {{ships were}} simply {{set on fire}} or 'conveniently sunk'. In Tudor times, ships were also {{dismantled}} and the timber re-used. This procedure was no longer applicable {{with the advent of}} metal-hulled boats. The navy vessel [...] had her masts, stores and guns removed and her crew paid off. She was sold by Dutch auction on 16 August 1838 to John Beatson, a shipbreaker based at Rotherhithe for £5,530. Beatson was then faced with the task of transporting the ship 55 miles from Sheerness to Rotherhithe, the largest ship to have attempted this voyage. To accomplish this he hired two steam tugs from the Thames Steam Towing Company and employed a Rotherhithe pilot named William Scott and twenty five men to sail her up the Thames, at a cost of £58. The shipbreakers undertook a thorough dismantling, removing all the copper sheathing, <b>rudder</b> <b>pintles</b> and gudgeons, copper bolts, nails and other fastenings to be sold back to the Admiralty. The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture. The ship's final voyage was immortalised by William Turner's painting The Fighting ‘Temeraire’, Tugged to her Last Berth to be Broken Up, 1838.|$|R
5000|$|... 1972 model saw a {{revision}} of the rudder blade's shape, the <b>rudder's</b> gudgeon and <b>pintle,</b> a new shape daggerboard, and a switch to a Sunfish designed cockpit bailer. This {{was a turning point}} for those pieces of equipment, thereafter referred as [...] "New Style" [...] by owners of Sunfish from that era.|$|R
25|$|Oars {{mounted on}} the side of ships evolved into quarter rudders, which were used from antiquity {{until the end of the}} Middle Ages in Europe. As the size of ships and the height of the freeboards increased, quarter-rudders became {{unwieldy}} and were replaced by the more sturdy stern-mounted <b>rudders</b> with <b>pintle</b> and gudgeon attachment. While stern-mounted rudders were found in Europe on a wide range of vessels since Roman times, including light war galleys in Mediterranean, the oldest known depiction of a pintle-and-gudgeon rudder can be found on church carvings of Zedelgem and Winchester dating to around 1180.|$|R
