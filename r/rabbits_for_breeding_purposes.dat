They, like Astatotilapia burtoni, are maternal mouthbrooders and breed readily in good conditions.|$|R
50|$|Such {{shows are}} useful to breeders {{as a means}} of {{evaluating}} dogs <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>purposes.</b> A conformation championship from a recognized national kennel club is generally considered a reasonably objective indication of merit, as it indicates that the dog {{has been found to be}} a superior example of its breed by some number of different judges on some number of separate occasions. Many breeders even consider championship a prerequisite <b>for</b> <b>breeding.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} and building of horse transports {{for use in}} war meant it remained easy to transfer horses <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> and purchase during peacetime.
