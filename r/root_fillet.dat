50|$|MiG-23P: ("Flogger-G") This was a {{specialized}} air-defense interceptor variant {{developed for the}} PVO Strany. It had the same airframe and powerplant as the MiG-23ML, {{but there is a}} cut-back fin <b>root</b> <b>fillet</b> instead of the original extended one on other models. Its avionics suite was improved to meet PVO requirements and mission profiles. Its radar was the improved Sapfir-23P, which could be used in conjunction with the gunsight for better look-down/shoot-down capabilities to counter increasing low-level threats like cruise missiles. The IRST, however, was absent. The autopilot included a new digital computer, and it was linked with the Lasur-M datalink. This enabled ground-controlled interception (GCI) ground stations to steer the aircraft towards the target; in such an intercept, all the pilot had to do was control the engine and use the weapons. The MiG-23P was the most numerous PVO interceptor in the 1980s. Around 500 aircraft were manufactured between 1978 and 1981. The MiG-23P was never exported and served only within the PVO in Soviet service.|$|E
50|$|The Falcon 20 is {{furnished}} {{with a highly}} swept wing; it is equipped with leading-edge slats to improve its slow speed performance and increase the stalling speed. When approaching a high angle of attack, the slats are automatically deployed; when nearing a potential stall, the inner section of the slats then retract to provide for a stable and predictable stall with effective aileron controls throughout. On the Falcon 200 model, the wing was re-profiled for improved low-speed performance and shortened runway requirements, {{as well as the}} addition of an unusual wing <b>root</b> <b>fillet</b> section and a shortened wing fence; the development of an entirely new wing was under consideration at one point, but the improved performance was not viewed to justify the expense. While air brakes are present upon the wing, these are less smooth and more noisy than the use of the dual-brake arrangement upon the landing gear. For ease of movement on the ground, a fully steerable nosewheel is incorporated and is controlled from the captain's position in the cockpit.|$|E

Two Categories Of Systematic Analyses Are Carried Out Using Finite Element Model Of Spur Gear. In The First Category Of Analyses Emphasize Is Given To Determine The Maximum <b>Root</b> <b>Fillet</b> Stress Which Is Required As Reference To Determine The Stress Reduction Factor. In Addition To This, The Effect Of Number Of Teeth, Pressure Angle, And Basic Parameters Of Rack Cutter On <b>Root</b> <b>Fillet</b> Stress Is Investigated. In Second Category Which Is The Prime Focus Of This Work; The Effect Of Introducing Geometric Stress Relief Feature Is Carried Out. Circular Stress Relief Feature Of Different Size At Strategic Locations On A Spur Gear Tooth Are Introduced. This Reduces The <b>Root</b> <b>Fillet</b> Stress. The Magnitude Of The Load Shared By A Gear Tooth Depends On The Position Of The Point Of Contact Of Teeth Engagement Along The Line Of Action. It Also Depends On Contact Ratio. High Contact Ratio Gear Teeth Pairs Are Subjected Low Load In Comparison Low Contact Ratio Gear For Transmitting Same Amount Of Torque. A Tooth Is Released From The Load As Soon As It Disengages With The Mating Gear Tooth And It Is Taken By The Next Conjugate Tooth. Therefore The Gear Teeth Are Subjected Varying (Fatigue) Load. If A Gear Fails By Bending Fatigue, The Failure Is Catastrophic And Occurs With Little Or No Warnings. The Maximum <b>Root</b> <b>Fillet</b> Tensile Stress Is One Of The Key Factors Which Determine The Fatigue Life Of The Gear. Therefore The Magnitude Of The Maximum Value Of The <b>Root</b> <b>Fillet</b> Tensile Stress Can Be Treated As The Index Of Fatigue Life Of Gear.

40|$|Abstract—Gearing is {{the special}} {{division}} of Mechanical Engineering {{concerned with the}} transmission of power and motion between the rotating shafts. Gears not only transmit motion and enormous power satisfactorily, but can do so with very uniform motion. It is {{the best and the}} economical means of achieving this transmission. Gear teeth fails due to the static and the dynamic loads acting over it, also the contact between the two meting gears causes the surface failures. The gear fails without any warning and the results due to this failure are catastrophic. Since the requirements are broad and are of varying difficulty, gearing is a complex and diversified field of engineering. It includes gear mathematics, geometrical design, strength and wear, material and metallurgy, fabrication and inspection. Therefore for all the reasons mentioned, this work is of more practical importance. To get the gear of more durability we can use improved material, hardening the gear surfaces with heat treatment and carburization, shot penning can be done to improve the surface finish, to change the pressure angle by using asymmetric teeth, introducing the stress relieving features of different shape, changing the addendum of the spur gear and altering the design of <b>root</b> <b>fillet</b> are the other methods.

40|$|The test {{programme}} involves the analysis, using two and three-dimensional photoelastic model techniques, of an epicyclic gear assembly incorporating typical features of production gear units.

Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of contact loads and load distribution, maximum sub-surface stresses, maximum <b>root</b> <b>fillet</b> bending stresses and the geometry of the lines of contact. An extensive two-dimensional {{test programme}} is reported in which stress concentration factors in the <b>root</b> <b>fillet</b> radii due to shear, bending and radial loads are evaluated.

40|$|Tests of a 167 Kilowatt (224 Horsepower) {{split torque}} face gearbox were {{performed}} by the Boeing Company in Mesa, Arizona, while working under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP). This paper provides a summary of these cooperative tests, which were jointly funded by Boeing and DARPA. Design, manufacture and testing of the scaled-power TRP proof-of-concept (POC) split torque gearbox followed preliminary evaluations of the concept performed early in the program. The split torque tests were run using 200 N-m (1767 in-lbs) torque input to {{each side of the}} transmission. During tests, two input pinions were slow rolled while in mesh with the two face gears. Two idler gears were also used in the configuration to recombine torque near the output. Resistance was applied at the output face gear to create the required loading conditions in the gear teeth. A system of weights, pulleys and cables were used in the test rig to provide both the input and output loading. Strain gages applied in the tooth <b>root</b> <b>fillets</b> provided strain indication used to determine torque splitting conditions at the input pinions. The final two pinion-two idler tests indicated 52 % to 48 % average torque split capabilities for the two pinions. During the same tests, a 57 % to 43 % average distribution of the torque being recombined to the upper face gear from the lower face gear was measured between the two idlers.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the behaviour of thin webbed rolled steel joists or universal beams when they are subjected to concentrated loads applied to the flanges. The prime concern is the effect of high direct stresses causing web failure in a small region of the beam. The review shows that although many tests have been carried out on rolled steel beams and built up girders, no series of tests has restricted the number of variables involved to enable firm conclusions to be drawn. The results of 100 tests on several different rolled steel universal beam sections having various types of loading conditions are presented. The majority of the beams are tested by loading with two opposite loads, thus eliminating the effects of bending and shear, except for a small number of beams which are tested simply supported on varying spans. The test results are first compared with the present design standard (BS 449) and it is shown that the British Standard is very conservative for most of the loading conditions included in the tests but is unsafe for others. Three possible failure modes are then considered, overall elastic buckling of the web, flexural yielding of the web due to large out of plane deflexions and local crushing of the material at the junction of the web and the <b>root</b> <b>fillets.</b> Each mode is considered theoretically and developed to establish the main variables, thus enabling a comparison to be made with the test results. It is shown that all three failure modes have a particular relevance for individual loading conditions, but that determining the failure load given the beam size and the loading conditions is very difficult in certain instances. Finally it is shown that there are some empirical relationships between the failure loads and the type of loading for various beam serial sizes...|$|R
