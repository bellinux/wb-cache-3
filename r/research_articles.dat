5|$|In 1914, Petrie {{launched}} the academic journal Ancient Egypt, published {{through his own}} British School of Archaeology in Egypt (BSAE), which was based at UCL. Given that he was often away from London excavating in Egypt, Murray was left to operate as de facto editor much of the time. She also published many <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> in the journal and authored many of its book reviews, particularly of the German-language publications which Petrie could not read.|$|E
5|$|Philosophical Transactions is {{the oldest}} and longest-running {{scientific}} journal in the world, having first been published in March 1665 by the first secretary of the society, Henry Oldenburg. It now publishes themed issues on specific topics and, since 1886, has been divided into two parts; A, which deals with mathematics and the physical sciences, and B, which deals with the biological sciences. Proceedings of the Royal Society consists of freely submitted <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> and is similarly divided into two parts. Biology Letters publishes short <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> and opinion pieces on all areas of biology and was launched in 2005. Journal of the Royal Society Interface publishes cross-disciplinary research at {{the boundary between the}} physical and life sciences, while Interface Focus, publishes themed issue in the same areas. Notes and Records is the Society's journal on the history of science. Biographical Memoirs is published annually and contains extended obituaries of deceased Fellows. Open Biology is an open access journal covering biology at the molecular and cellular level. Royal Society Open Science is an open access journal publishing high-quality original research across the entire range of science on the basis of objective peer-review. All the society's journals are peer-reviewed.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, Smyth {{began to}} shift his {{interest}} to nuclear physics, inspired by James Chadwick's {{discovery of the}} neutron, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton splitting the atom, and Ernest Lawrence's invention of the cyclotron. Three of his last <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> concerned detection of triatomic hydrogen and helium-3. His appointment as department chair forced him to {{devote more time to}} administrative work, at the expense of research. As department chair, he had two cyclotrons built at Princeton, one in 1935 and the other in 1946.|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{assigned}} significant roles to <b>research</b> <b>article</b> abstracts {{for the purpose}} of informing the reader about the content of the article by compressing the most important findings in its writing. It also allows the reader to decide whether to read the entire article or not (Martin, 2003). Therefore, writing a <b>research</b> <b>article</b> abstract needs an initial focus on textual and rhetorical features that constitute an efficacious <b>research</b> <b>article</b> abstract. One of the textual features is Theme (Gosden, 1992). Theme is defined as an element, which serves as the point of departure of the message in a clause and {{plays a major role in}} text organization. It helps a text to be communicated and understood clearly (Halliday, 1994). This study aims to investigate the Theme types and patterns used in 120 <b>research</b> <b>article</b> abstracts from the disciplines of Applied Linguistics, Economics, Agriculture and Applied Physics. The gathered data were analyzed based on Halliday’s (1994) model of Thematic organization and Eggins’ (2004) model of Thematic progression. The results revealed disciplinary differences, which generally lead to specificity of selection of the Theme types and patterns used in the writing of the <b>research</b> <b>article</b> abstract...|$|R
