The model reveals how an anisotropic body – composed of a cylinder and sphere varying sinusoidally in size and relative displacement – achieves unidirectional motion through a medium with variable frictional prop-erties. This net displacement is attained even though the body kinematics are reciprocal and inertia of both the model organism and the surrounding medium are negligible.

Our findings and analysis provide a more complete understanding of the current airport passenger security screening experience. Data in this paper is comprised of field studies conducted at two Australian airports, one domestic and one international.

First, the activities of passengers are coded and analysed to reveal the common activities at domestic and international security regimes and between quiet and busy periods. Second, observation of passenger activities is used to reveal uncommon aspects. The results show that passengers do more at security screening that being passively scanned. Passengers queue, unpack the required items from their bags and from their pockets, walk through the metal-detector, <b>re-pack</b> and occasionally return to be re-screened. For each of these activities, passengers must understand the procedures at the security screening point and must co-ordinate various actions and objects in time and space.

It is expected that this kind of system will dominatethe parallel computer market in the near future because of the continued costeffective growth in performance. For this type of machine to be truly utilised asgeneral-purpose high-performance computing servers for various kinds of applications, effective job scheduling facilities have to be developed to achieve highefficiency of resource utilisation. It is known that coordinated scheduling of parallel jobs across the proces-sors is a critical factor to achieve efficient parallel execution in a time-shared environment. Currently the most popular scheme for coordinated scheduling isexplicit coscheduling [4], or gang scheduling [3]. With gang scheduling processes of the same job will run simultaneously for only certain amount of time whichis called scheduling slot. When a scheduling slot is ended, the processors will context-switch {{at the same time to}} give the service to processes of another job. All parallel jobs in the system take turns to receive the service in a coordinated manner...|$|E
40|$|The {{advection}} of integral {{lines is}} an important computational kernel in vector field visualization. We investigate how this kernel can profit from vector (SIMD) extensions in modern CPUs. As a baseline, we formulate a streamline tracing algorithm that facilitates auto-vectorization by an optimizing compiler. We analyze this algorithm and propose two different optimizations. Our results show that particle tracing does not per se benefit from SIMD computation. Based on a careful analysis of the auto-vectorized code, we propose an optimized data access routine and a <b>re-packing</b> scheme which increases average SIMD efficiency. We evaluate our approach on three different, turbulent flow fields. Our optimized approaches increase integration performance up to 5 : 6 over our baseline measurement.

40|$|Over-use of {{chemicals}} {{has led to}} plant pest resistance and even to loss of soil fertility. As {{a result of this}} widespread misuse of pesticides and agro-chemicals, the Ministry of Agriculture in Ghana, together with the Environment Protection Council and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), are to draw up legislation to enforce a national pesticide policy. This is intended to ensure the safe distribution and use of agro-chemicals and to control the flood of pesticides imports. To achieve high crop yields farmers often rely on chemicals. But many, particularly small farmers, {{do not know how to}} use them properly and, because of illiteracy or labels only being printed in English, or through lack of training and supervision, they may be unaware of the dangers to the land and them selves. Many are also ignorant of the dangers that empty containers present and rinse them out in ponds and streams or use them for carrying water. Worse still, village stores often <b>re-pack</b> pesticides in soft drink bottles or unmarked containers leading to cases of poisoning. Spraying {{of chemicals}} is often carried out with the sprayer wearing little or no protective gear. And ignorance of application, harvesting and picking intervals has meant that residues are left in crops sold to the public. A further danger is that seed treated for planting has been consumed during food shortages. The new legislation will be accompanied by a public awareness campaign and a training programme for farmers.

40|$|Postharvest fruit decay {{caused by}} Penicillium {{pathogens}} {{is considered to}} be one of the most important challenges in the pear industry resulting in market-end losses. Moving export fruit through different environments exposes the product to extensive handling, temperature variations and microbes. The profile of Penicillium spp. present in the pear export chain from South Africa to the United Kingdom was therefore studied over a four year period. Sampling was done at two packhouse facilities, controlled atmosphere and cold storage areas in South Africa and at two <b>re-pack</b> facilities and cold storages as well as a distribution centre and a retailer in the United Kingdom. Sampling consisted of swabbing walls and floors and using active and passive air sampling. In total 5 056 isolates were obtained, purified and grouped into a total of 282 morphological groups. Of these 350 representative isolates were selected for further identification. The five most dominant species in the pear chain were: P. glabrum (23. 40 %); P. chrysogenum (15. 13 %); P. crustosum (14. 16 %); P. brevicompactum (8. 96 %); P. expansum (8. 39 %), of which the latter three were confirmed pathogenic on pears.

40|$|Despite {{increased}} awareness, poor {{adherence to}} treatments for chronic diseases remains a global problem. Adherence issues {{are common in}} patients taking antihypertensive therapy and associated with increased risks of coronary and cerebrovascular events. Whilst {{there has been a}} gradual trend toward improved control of hypertension, the number of patients with blood pressure values above goal has remained constant. This has both personal and economic consequences. Medication adherence is a multifaceted issue and consists of three components: initiation, implementation, and persistence. A combination of methods is recommended to measure adherence, with electronic monitoring and drug measurement being the most accurate. Pill burden, resulting from free combinations of blood pressure lowering treatments, makes the daily routine of medication taking complex, which can be a barrier to optimal adherence. Single-pill fixed-dose combinations simplify the habit of medication taking and improve medication adherence. <b>Re-packing</b> of medication is also being utilized as a method of improving adherence.

40|$|FPGA device area is {{dominated}} by the on-chip interconnect. For this reason, the amount of interconnect provided must be limited. This limit is usually imposed by designing an FPGA device family with a fixed channel width.

40|$|Using {{a single}} {{traditional}} gang scheduling algorithm cannot {{provide the best}} performance for all workloads and parallel architectures. A solution for this problem {{is the use of}} an algorithm that is capable of dynamically changing its form (configuration) into a more appropriate one, according to environment variations and user requirements.

The RGSA uses combinations of independent features that are often implemented in GSAs such as: packing and <b>re-packing</b> schemes (alternative scheduling etc.), multiprogramming levels etc. Ideally, the algorithm may assume infinite configurations and it reconfigures itself according to entry parameters such as: performance metrics (mean utilization, mean jobs response time etc.) and workload characteristics (mean jobs execution time, mean parallelism degree of jobs etc.). Also ideally, a reconfiguration causes the algorithm to output the best configuration for a particular situation considering the system's state at a given moment and based on past information.

The application of standardized approaches improves {{the efficiency of}} logistic operations. This paper presents a conceptual framework based on the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard for analyzing the efficiency of logistic operations at port terminals. The paper contributes to logistics research by studying time efficiency {{in the management of}} trailers and cargo at terminals based on the adoption of the international EPCIS standard. The literature was reviewed to establish a conceptual framework and a case study was then conducted regarding time efficiency in managing the export and import of trailers and transshipments of cargo between trailers at two port terminals in the United Kingdom and one port terminal in the Netherlands. The findings show that by adopting the EPCIS standard, port operators can improve logistic management efficiency, including the arriving, transporting, receiving, inspecting, outbound staging, loading, picking-up, unloading, <b>re-packing,</b> and shipping operations of trailers.
