40|$|Abstract. Link {{prediction}} {{is a key}} technique in many applications in social networks, where potential links between entities need to be predicted. Conventional link prediction techniques deal with either homogeneous entities, e. g., people to people, item to item links, or non-reciprocal relationships, e. g., people to item links. However, a challenging problem in link {{prediction is}} that of heterogeneous and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>link</b> prediction, such as accurate prediction of matches on an online dating site, jobs or workers on employment websites, where the links are reciprocally determined by both entities that heterogeneously belong to disjoint groups. The nature and causes of interactions in these domains makes heterogeneous and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>link</b> prediction {{significantly different from the}} conventional version of the problem. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a novel learnable framework called ReHeLP, which learns heterogeneous and reciprocal knowledge from collaborative information and demonstrate its impact on link prediction. Evaluation on a large commercial online dating dataset shows the success of the proposed method and its promise for link prediction...|$|R

30|$|Based on Table  4, some {{endogenous}} attributes {{have the}} same effect on all communities. In particular, reciprocity has a significant positive effect on 80 % of our sample (in 15 %, reciprocity has no effect on the emergence of new relations between suppliers and customers). Thus, in 80 % of the communities, there is a high chance of the emergence of a link from a supplier to a customer if the reverse relation exists. A few communities (5 %) show a negative effect of reciprocity on the appearance of new links between firms. These five communities are characterized by an absence of reciprocal links; three of them have 2 <b>reciprocal</b> <b>links,</b> one has 0 <b>reciprocal</b> <b>links,</b> and one has 4 <b>reciprocal</b> <b>links.</b> Thus, the observed negative effect can be interpreted as an absence of mutual partnerships.|$|E

40|$|Explicit {{computation}} for a Kawamoto-type equation {{shows that}} there is a rich associated symmetry structure for four separate hierarchies of nonlinear integrodifferential equations. Contrary to the general belief that symmetry groups for nonlinear evolution equations in 1 + 1 dimensions have to be Abelian, it is shown that, in this case, the symmetry group is noncommutative. Its semisimple part is isomorphic to the affine Lie algebra A 1 (1) associated to s 1 (2,ℂ). In two of the additional hierarchies that were found, an explicit dependence of the independent variable occurs. Surprisingly, the generic invariance for the Kawamoto-type equation obtained in Rogers and Carillo [Phys. Scr. 36, 865 (1987) ] via a reciprocal link to the Möbius invariance of the singularity equation of the Kaup-Kupershmidt (KK) equation only holds for one of the additional hierarchies of symmetry groups. Thus the generic invariance is not a universal property for the complete symmetry group of equations obtained by <b>reciprocal</b> <b>links.</b> In addition to these results, the bi-Hamiltonian formulation of the hierarchy is given. A direct Bäcklund transformation between the (KK) hierarchy and the hierarchy of singularity equation for the Caudrey-Dodd-Gibbon-Sawada-Kotera equation is exhibited: This shows that the abundant symmetry structure found for the Kawamoto equation must exist for all fifth-order equations, which are known to be completely integrable since these equations are connected either by Bäcklund transformations or <b>reciprocal</b> <b>links.</b> It is shown that similar results must hold for all hierarchies emerging out of singularity hierarchies via <b>reciprocal</b> <b>links.</b> Furthermore, general aspects of the results are discussed. © 1989 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

To limit the number of key errors, we ensure that only the points that fall outside the guard band interval are accepted for key generation.
