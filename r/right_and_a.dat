25|$|The three central upper panels show a Deësis of monumental and enthroned figures, {{each with}} a halo. They are the Virgin Mary to the left, John the Baptist to the <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> central figure who may be either God or Christ – a {{distinction}} much debated amongst art historians. Theories include that the panel shows Christ in Majesty dressed as in a priest's vestments, God the Father, or the Holy Trinity amalgamated into a single person. The figure looks towards the viewer with his hand raised in blessing, in a panel filled with inscriptions and symbols. There are Greek inscriptions decorated with pearls on the hem of his robe or mantle, which, taken from Revelation, read REX REGUM ET DOMINUS DOMINANTIUM ("King of Kings, and Lord of Lords").|$|E
25|$|For Francis, {{work is a}} {{gift and}} to work is a grace.

In the conviction that work is a <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> duty and that every form of occupation deserves respect, the brothers and sisters should commit themselves to collaborate so that all persons may have the possibility to work and so that working conditions may always be more humane. Leisure and recreation have their own value and are necessary for personal development. Secular Franciscans should maintain a balance between work and rest and should strive to make meaningful use of their leisure time.|$|E

25|$|Early {{in ancient}} Indian culture, the river Ganges was {{associated}} with fecundity, its redeeming waters and its rich silt providing sustenance to all who lived along its banks. A counterpoise to the dazzling heat of the Indian summer, the Ganges came to be imbued with magical qualities and to be revered in anthropomorphic form. By the 5th century CE, an elaborate mythology surrounded the Ganges, now a goddess in her own <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> symbol for all rivers of India. Hindu temples all over India had statues and reliefs of the goddess carved at their entrances, symbolically washing the sins of arriving worshippers and guarding the gods within. As protector of the sanctum sanctorum, the goddess soon came to depicted with several characteristic accessories: the makara (a crocodile-like undersea monster, often shown with an elephant-like trunk), the kumbha (an overfull vase), various overhead parasol-like coverings, and a gradually increasing retinue of humans.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} Falkenhayn, still on his journey south, ordered the {{recapture}} of Ras en Naqb by the 77th Regiment (19th Division) and the 8th Cavalry Regiment. A patrol to reconnoitre the high ground occupied by about half an Ottoman battalion, {{in the direction of}} the Beersheba to Jerusalem road by a troop of the Worcestershire Yeomanry (5th Mounted Brigade), came under heavy rifle fire at 06:00, forcing them to return to Ras en Naqb. The regiment was relieved half an hour later by the Gloucester Yeomanry, although the Worcestershire Regiment remained close by, saddled up in the wadi with the led horses. At 14:00, they returned to take over the line again from the Gloucester Yeomanry. By 15:00, intermittent Ottoman shelling was increasing in volume, when an additional Ottoman battery came into action on the <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> strong counterattack developed. This attack from the north east was mainly against an advanced troop on the right centre, which was compelled to retire.|$|E
25|$|Believing {{he faced}} only cavalry, Slocum {{attempted}} to brush aside the Confederates by attacking with the 1st Division of Brig. Gen. William P. Carlin {{with support from}} the 3rd Division of Brig. Gen. Absalom Baird, both from the XIV Corps but this attack was driven back. Slocum then deployed his divisions in a defensive line, with Carlin's division on the left, Baird's division in the center, Brig. Gen. James D. Morgan's 2nd Division on the <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> XX Corps division in support, in order to delay the Confederates long enough to allow the rest of his wing to arrive. None of the divisions, except for Morgan's, constructed strong breastworks, which were further compromised by a gap {{in the center of the}} Union line. Lafayette McLaws' division from Hardee's command was approaching the Confederate positions at the time of the Union attacks; due to Bragg's concern about a flanking attack on Hoke's left, McLaws was ordered to deploy on the Confederate left flank. About noon, Hardee arrived with the division of William B. Taliaferro, which was deployed behind the Army of Tennessee. Hardee was then placed in charge of the Confederate right wing.|$|E
