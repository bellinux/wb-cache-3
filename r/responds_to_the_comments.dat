They tackle my {{proposal}} to redescribe bioethical debates through {{the idea that}} in procreation, sexuality and dying new fields of experience are being opened and {{are in need of}} human resources, in order for individuals to make something of themselves in such circumstances. I go back to a conception of moral thought offered in the book, which I work out by learning from Wittgenstein how to elucidate the life with the concepts related to human life, and by exploring, with the help of both Mill and the later Foucault, the idea that an active exercise of one’s freedom is seen in the capacity to give form to one’s life, made possible by a society hospitable to such work of invention of individualities and styles of existence...|$|E

The current authors thank the commentators for their productive discussion of the Many Labs project. They entirely agree with the main theme across the commentaries: direct replication does not guarantee that the same effect was tested. As noted by Nosek and Lakens (2014, p. 137), "direct replication is the attempt to duplicate the conditions and procedure that existing theory and evidence anticipate as necessary for obtaining the effect. " Attempting to do so does not guarantee success, but it does provide substantial opportunity for theoretical development building on empirical evidence...|$|E
