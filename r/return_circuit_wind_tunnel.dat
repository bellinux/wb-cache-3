50|$|A {{hypersonic}} <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{is designed}} to generate a hypersonic flow field in the working section, thus simulating the typical flow features of this flow regime - including compression shocks and pronounced boundary layer effects, entropy layer and viscous interaction zones and most importantly high total temperatures of the flow. The speed of these tunnels vary from Mach 5 to 15. The power requirement of a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> increases with the cross section, the flow density and is directly proportional to the third power of the test velocity. Hence installation of a continuous, closed <b>circuit</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> remains a costly affair. The first continuous Mach 7-10 <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> with 1x1 m test section was planned at Kochel am See, Germany during WW II and finally put into operation as 'Tunnel A' in the late 1950s at AEDC Tullahoma, TN, USA for an installed power of 57 MW. In view of these high facility demands, also intermittently operated experimental facilities like blow-down <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> are designed and installed to simulate the hypersonic flow. A hypersonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> comprises in flow direction the main components: heater/cooler arrangements, dryer, convergent/divergent nozzle, test section, second throat and diffuser. A blow-down <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> has a low vacuum reservoir at the back end, while a continuously operated, closed <b>circuit</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> has a high power compressor installation instead. Since the temperature drops with the expanding flow, the air inside the test section has the chance of becoming liquefied. For that reason, preheating is particularly critical (the nozzle may require cooling).|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} closed <b>circuit</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> has {{historically}} been performed using rule of thumb which have evolved over the years into a body of useful guidelines. The development of indraft <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels,</b> however, {{has not been as}} well documented. The design of indraft <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> is therefore generally performed using a more intuitive approach, often resulting in a facility with disappointing flow quality. The primary problem is a lack of understanding of the flow in the inlet as it passes through the required antiturbulence treatment. For <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> which employ large contraction ratio inlets, this lack of understanding is not serious since the relatively low velocity of the flow through the inlet treatment reduces the sensitivity to improper inlet design. When designing a small contraction ratio inlet, much more careful design is needed {{in order to reduce the}} flow distortions generated by the inlet treatment. As part of the National Full Scale Aerodynamics Complex Modification Project, 2 -D computational methods were developed which account for the effect of both inlet screens and guide vanes on the test section velocity distribution. Comparisons with experimental data are presented which indicate that the methods accurately compute the flow distortions generated by a screen in a nonuniform velocity field. The use of inlet guide vanes to eliminate the screen induced distortion is also demonstrated both computationally and experimentally.
