Pooerten’s group in Katholieke Universiteit Leuven [13] developed a co-manipulation and tele-manipulation robotic system for retinal surgery composed of a salve manipulator and a cable-driven master controller. Researchers from TU Eindhoven [14] conducted the similar research with Pooerten’s and proposed the PRESEYES micromanipulator. PRESEYES consists of a motion controller and a table mounted manipulator.

The {{purpose of this}} study is to compare the incidence of postoperative AKI according to different surgical techniques and also the risk factors, outcomes of AKI in patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery. Methods: A retrospective medical chart review was done in a total of 288 patients who received proctectomy because of rectal cancer from 2011 to 2013. Results: The mean patient age was 62  ±  12  years, and male was 64. 2 %. Preoperative creatinine was 0. 91 ± 0. 18 mg/dL. Open surgery was performed in 9 %, and laparoscopy assisted surgery or <b>robot</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>surgery</b> were performed in 54. 8 % or 36. 1 % of patients, respectively. AKI developed in 11 patients (3. 82 %), 2 (18 %) of them received acute hemodialysis. Incidence of AKI was not different according to the surgical technique, however, the presence of diabetes, intraoperative shock, and postoperative ileus was associated with the development of AKI. In addition, AKI patients showed significantly longer hospital stay and higher mortality than non-AKI patients. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that despite advances in surgical techniques, incidence of postoperative AKI remains unchanged and also that postoperative AKI is associated with poor outcome. We also found that presence of diabetes, intraoperative shock and postoperative ileus are strongly associated with the development of AKI. More careful attention should be paid on high risk patients for the development of postoperative AKI regardless of surgical techniques...|$|E
40|$|Active {{constraints}} are collaborative human-robot control algorithms {{which have}} a well-established history of use within <b>robot</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>surgery</b> research. This control strategy anisotropically regulates the motion of a human user {{in such a way}} that it effectively combines the competencies of surgeons and robots, allowing for improved clinical outcomes and surgeon experience. The significant majority of research previously presented for active constraints focuses on their application to static procedures, where the surgical environment is assumed to be rigid throughout. In this thesis, several research contributions are presented which assist with applying active constraints in surgical procedures within deforming soft tissue. The primary contribution is the formulation of a novel haptic control algorithm, based on friction, which can effectively guide a surgeon in both positioning and orienting a surgical instrument, while guaranteeing that the haptic interaction is energetically dissipative. The proven dissipative formulation of these `dynamic frictional constraints' ensures that the surgeon always has overall control of a procedure and makes the system resilient to limitations and errors in the robot's comprehension of the surgical environment. To apply active constraints within deforming tissue, it is necessary to compute the geometric relationship between the surgical instruments and the constrained anatomy. A novel bounding volume is proposed which, when used in a hierarchy, exploits the limits of soft tissue deformations to increase the resolution of constraint geometries that can be used at stable control rates. The experimental validation of these research contributions in a clinically realistic nerve dissection simulation and in non-clinical dynamic path-following tasks, shows significant benefits to the user in several metrics characterising surgical accuracy and precision. These results demonstrate that the proposed enhancements of active constraints could lead to increased surgeon performance, fewer complications and improved clinical outcomes in soft tissue surgical procedures.

40|$|Abstract in English Comparison between Open and <b>Robot</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>surgery</b> in {{prostate}} cancer regarding adverse events Student: David Wallin Supervisor: Professor Eva Haglind Background: Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) has become widely used {{side by side}} with the golden standard technique Retropubic Radical Prostatectomy (RRP). Still, there are no studies comparing the incidence of adverse events between the two techniques. Objective: To retrospectively study the patients in the LAPPRO-trial regarding adverse events leading to readmission within 3 months after prostatectomy with RALP or RRP, using the Clavien-Dindo system. Methods: Using the National Patient Register, the patient records were collected from the different health care providers. Each readmission was classified according to the Clavien-Dindo system and given one ICD- 10 code (which were then sorted into groups). The proportions of readmissions receiving a specific grade were measured as “number of readmissions per 100 treated patients” (ra/ 100 pat) Results: RALP had a higher proportion of patients in grade 1 (2 ra/ 100 pat) and grade 2 (4 ra/ 100 pat) compared to RRP: grade 1 (1 ra/ 100 pat) and grade 2 (3 ra/ 100 pat). RRP had a higher proportion of grade 3 a readmission (3 ra/ 100 pat) compared to RALP (1 ra/ 100 pat). The proportion of grade 3 b readmissions was (2 ra/ 100 pat) for both RALP and RRP. Regarding the types of ICD- 10 RALP-patients seemed to have more diseases from the digestive system and more nonspecific abdominal pain. RRP-patients seemed to suffer from more pulmonary embolism, noninfectious diseases in the lymphatic system, diseases in the genitourinary system and urinary retention. Conclusions: There was no difference between the two surgical techniques regarding the total proportion of readmissions but RALP-patients seemed to require less invasive therapy compared to RRP-patients. RALP-patients seemed to have more adverse events from the abdomen and the RRP patients seemed to have more pulmonary embolism and more adverse events from the genitourinary system and the lymphatic system...|$|E

Cochleostomy procedure in cochlear implantation surgery is one such procedure, {{proven to be a}} complex practice even for the most experienced surgeon. In this thesis, the drilling processes involved in conventional cochleostomy are looked at. Due to dexterity and precision robotics offer, it is deemed the efficiency of the in situ drilling procedure of the cochleostomy can be greatly increased {{with the use of a}} robotic manipulator tool. Despite commercial success of general robotic platforms, practical use in task specific microsurgery is still challenging, due to considerable levels of accuracy required at sub-millimeter scales, limited visualization, degrees of freedom, range of motion, large footprint and constrained visual and tool accessibility, under operation microscopes. The proposed task specific surgical manipulator addresses the drawbacks of existing surgical manipulators and other apparatus for the purpose of cochleostomy. The proposed tool: a six degrees of freedom manipulator, is a micromanipulator that is attached to the surgical microscope boom. The surgeon is able to use the manipulator as conventional surgical drill tool for drilling and clearing of bone. The thesis looks at the development of the introduced surgical manipulator; from concept, theory to a proof of concept prototype.

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the paper “All-cause mortality in young women with endometrial cancer receiving progesterone therapy” by Maria P. Ruiz et al (1). The authors reported {{that the use of}} primary progesterone therapy increased significantly from 2004 to 2014 and that utilization was less frequent in older women, white women, and women with unfavorable grading and substaging. Moreover, the authors note, “its use was associated with decreased survival, particularly in women with stage IB tumors“. The results of this large study deserve some critical considerations. Given the demographic and clinical characteristics of the population, it appears that relatively few women were treated with primary progesterone therapy compared to primary hysterectomy. This trend is likely to generate contradictory bias. While oral progesterone therapy has remained largely unmodified over the past 10 years, surgery has undoubtedly improved greatly in terms of oncological outcomes and safety, thanks to better surgeons, expertise and improved technology (laparoscopy, <b>robot</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>surgery).</b> Moreover, the use of progesterone-releasing intrauterine devices has largely increased in the last 10 years in early endometrial cancer. Unfortunately, we don't know how many women were treated with oral or intrauterine progesterone, nor do we know the type and timing of surgical approach in women who underwent primary hysterectomy. We don't know the criteria used to select candidates for surgery, immediately or after primary progesterone therapy. We don't know how many women receiving primary progesterone therapy were also treated with resective hysteroscopy and how many received hysterectomy after primary progesterone therapy. Likewise we have no information about pharmaceutical selections (dosing, progestional agents, treatment interruptions and changes). According to recent data, the absence of such information undermines reliability of study results. (2, 3). This is not a small thing since some studies suggest ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT that the levonorgestrel intrauterine device could be superior to oral progestogens in the control of endometrial cancer and complex atypical hyperplasia (4). And we have to consider that use of progesterone delivering intrauterine device was rapidly increasing in the last years for neoplastic disorders in young patients. But above all, the study does not associate unfavorable survival data, in women treated with primary progesterone therapy, with the possible presence of risk factors for cardiovascular, thromboembolic and metabolic events. This greatly limits the validity of the authors’ conclusions, especially considering the small sample sizes. According to the above comments, it seems hard to state that primary progesterone therapy is less safe and less effective than primary hysterectomy in women with early endometrial cancer...|$|E
40|$|The term navigated {{surgery in}} the medical science {{describes}} the execution of surgical interventions using image data of the patient, which has been produced before the surgical intervention. To be able to define {{the position of the}} surgical instruments in relation to the image data, the definition of a geometrical relation between the patient's and the image data's coordinate systems, the registration, is necessary. Today, there are two different approaches for the execution of the registration. They are based on either the manual assignment of corresponding anatomical and artificial points of the patient (landmark-based procedures) or on the comparison of the surface topology (surface-based procedures). The landmark-based procedures are robust against measurement artefacts, {{but it is difficult to}} integrate them into the surgical procedure. Surface-based procedures show contrary advantages and disadvantages. Especially for advanced technologies (e. g. <b>robot</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>surgery)</b> a registration procedure is required, which can be automatically integrated into the surgical procedure and at the same time fulfils the high requirements of robustness against measuring and handling errors. Based on the state of the technology, the suggested approach is the development of a hybrid registration method, which combines the efficient and intuitional handling of the surface-based procedures with the robustness against failure impact of the landmark-based procedures. In this connection, the new procedure comes back to the approach of classification of surface geometries, which enables the representation of a local surface irrespective of its position as a so-called spin image. The approach is further developed within the conception phase and adjusted to the specific requirements of the robust medical registration. Especially the generation of the spin image and the early identification of erroneous point relations pose challenges, which have to be developed, analysed and selected. In the process an algorithmic procedure is created, which mostly avoids the disadvantages of existing registration procedures by automated identification and the alternating assignment of correlating geometrical topologies. The newly developed registration procedure has been realised as a computer-aided prototype to provide evidence of applicability, performance and software related feasibility. By means of a test surface, which has been developed in dependence of the topological characteristics of the target anatomy of the lateral cranial base, both an increase of the robustness compared to conventional surface-based procedures and an improvement of the integration capability compared to landmark-based procedures could be proven. However it led to increased efforts in calculation. By means of the exemplary integration into the workflow of a robot-assisted surgical intervention at the lateral cranial base it has been proven that the method in principle can be converted to the clinical field...|$|E

While {{this is not the}} first time pneumatics is used to actuate a tactile display, a satisfying valve has been missing. This valve is specifically designed to fill that gap. The presented valve is a proportional valve, controlled by a reluctance actuator and capable of dealing with relatively high pressures. To eliminate friction of the piston, an air bearing is included. A prototype offers a proof of concept, but it needs to be optimised to reach a full pressure range. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The first <b>robot</b> to <b>assist</b> in <b>surgery</b> was the Arthrobot, {{which was}} {{developed}} and used {{for the first time}} in Vancouver in 1983. Intimately involved were biomedical engineer, Dr. James McEwen, Geof Auchinleck, a UBC engineering physics grad, and Dr. Brian Day as well as a team of engineering students. The robot was used in an orthopaedic surgical procedure on 12 March 1984, at the UBC Hospital in Vancouver. Over 60 arthroscopic surgical procedures were performed in the first 12 months, and a 1985 National Geographic video on industrial robots, The Robotics Revolution, featured the device. Other related robotic devices developed at the same time included a surgical scrub nurse robot, which handed operative instruments on voice command, and a medical laboratory robotic arm. A YouTube video entitled Arthrobot illustrates some of these in operation.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Registration is a {{critical}} step, which links the planning and execution phases of most CAS applications. In this procedure the geometric relationships between the patient’s anatomy, the models used for planning and the robotic or sensorized tools employed intrasurgically, are calculated. The registration scheme described in this paper, based on enhanced ICP algorithm, doesn’t need any marker implant, thus reducing surgical invasiveness. Points on the bone surface are sampled by the robot which in turn, directs the surgical tool, thus eliminates additional coordinate transformation and increases operation accuracy. Materials and Methods: The registration technique was tested on an RSPR six degrees-of-freedom parallel robot specifically designed for medical applications. The six axis force sensor attached to the robot’s moving platform, enables fast and accurate acquisition of positions and bone surface normals at sampled points. Results: Sampling with a robot probe was shown to be accurate, fast and easy to perform. The robot alone {{does most of the}} registration work, leaving surgeon’s hands free. The whole procedure takes about 4 minutes. Conclusions: The simplicity and accuracy of the proposed registration appears to be sufficient for orthopaedic surgical applications. Robotic registration makes the flawless connection between the preoperative planning and robotic assistance during surgery.
