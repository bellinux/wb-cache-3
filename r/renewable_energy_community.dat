40|$|Although in {{the last}} decades a {{transition}} toward a sustainable <b>energy</b> system with <b>renewables</b> has been advocated by many, it is still uncertain where the support and required investments for renewables can come from. In this article we introduce and analyze a special type of investor group: <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>communities,</b> which are grassroots initiatives that invest in 'clean energy' {{in order to meet}} consumption needs and environmental goals and thereby – even unwittingly – conduce to the spread of renewables. The aim of the present study is to explore the potential of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>communities,</b> as social niches, to contribute to transitions in the energy system. To do so, we propose three indicators for measuring the transition potential of social niches, based on proxies for technological innovations derived from the literature. In addition, we reinterpret the notion of niches and the way transition occurs by arguing that niches are complex systems in which both technological and social innovations develop simultaneously and that during transition entire niches link up with the regime. Furthermore, we make a distinction between internally and externally oriented niches based on their orientation and application focus. Our results show that <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>communities</b> in the Netherlands are internally oriented social niches that have the potential for upscaling and contribute to sustainability transitions. We use a comparative case study analysis complemented by a systematic literature and documentary review to show that these communities are already changing the Dutch energy system, by connecting to regime actors.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to explore the possibility of using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model 3. 2. 1 (WRF) for creating synthetic wind speed time-series {{in the southern part of}} the Baltic Sea. The hourly wind speed time series derived from a mesoscale model were forced by the NCEP/NCAR re-analysis dataset for the period of 1991 ? 2000 using 2 -way nesting domains with horizontal resolutions of 27 and 9 km. Realism of spatial and temporal structure of the dataset was validated against in-situ offshore and onshore measurements. The dataset confirms the wind speed patterns over the Baltic Sea obtained in previous studies. The validation procedure proves that the model represents the spatio-temporal structure of the wind field well with a temporal correlation of around 0. 80 for those stations with an undisturbed, high quality archive dataset. It was found that the model tends to underestimate wind speeds over offshore areas and overestimate them over onshore areas, especially for the near-surface wind field.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Renewable energy {{development}} in China is expanding beyond {{the capabilities of}} existing institutions to provide support for sustainable commercial development. China is currently in a transition phase in which the central and local governments {{are in the process}} of developing new policy incentives and environmental regulations impacting renewable energy technology dissemination. There is still a large gap between renewable energy resource potential and existing levels of technology dissemination in China; nevertheless, project development is increasing in scale and a broader investment base is becoming available for project financing. In this transition, renewable energy industry groups in China need services in the form of policy advocacy, business development assistance and training, facilitation of financing, and assistance in interfacing with the international <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>community.</b> In 1999 the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Chinese State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) initiated support for the establishment of the Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association (CREIA). CREIA is a non profit and non-government organization that uses market-oriented approaches to interface with the domestic industry to promote renewable energy commercialization. CREIA will manage an Investment Opportunity Facility (IOF) to help connect projects with investors, and will play an advocacy role on behalf of industry with the government and other stakeholder groups. It will also provide services to members in form of market information, databases, trade missions, foreign exchanges, workshops, and training. This paper will summarize th...|$|E

40|$|The Park of Renewable Energy is an {{environmental}} technology {{park in the}} middle of Italy that has an innovative integrated system for the production of renewable energy. Recently, the Park launched a public invitation: to become part of a great widespread community for the production of renewable energy, and to promote energy conservation and a sustainable lifestyle. This empowerment process that turns consumers into energy producers – and also into those who convey the culture of sustainability – might, over time, give life to a community that actually lives according to the geoethical principles of biosustainability. The route for the identification and dissemination of the Park of <b>Renewable</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>community</b> is an interesting example of the generative process, whereby rather than doggedly pursuing a predetermined objective, such as a model to be implemented, the actors involved, “look for directions and values that are inherent in the means available” [Bateson 2000], including communication networks and methodologies of social participation. The community components focus their attention on the action and relationship effects, rather than on ways to reach a predefined goal. In this perspective, the Park of Renewable Energy experience aims to become an interesting object of observation and reflection for its green ethics.

40|$|Knowledge {{of solar}} energy {{resource}} has been generated {{over the past}} years within several European and national projects. Large steps forward have been made for the benefit of research, renewable energy industry and the environment. Nevertheless, these multiple efforts have led to a fragmentation and uncoordinated access: different sources of information and solar radiationproducts are now available, but uncertainty about their quality remains. At the same time, communities of users lack common understanding how to exploit the developed knowledge. The project MESoR aims at removing the uncertainty and improving the management of the solar energy resource knowledge. The results of past and present large-scale initiatives in Europe, will be integrated, standardised and disseminated in a harmonised way to facilitate their effective exploitation by stakeholders. This coordination action will contribute to preparation of the future roadmap for R&D and strengthening the European position in the international field. The project includes activities in user guidance (benchmarking of models and data sets; handbook; best practices), unification of access to information (use of advanced information technologies; offering one-stop-access to several databases), connecting to other initiatives (INSPIRE of the EU, POWER of the NASA, SHC and PVPS of the IEA, GMES/GEO) and to related scientific communities (energy, meterology, geography, medicine, ecology), and dissemination (stakeholders involvement, training, future R&D, communication). To that purpose, a consortium has been assembled that gathers several partners having co-ordinated large international projects in the domain and other partners bringing the necessary expertise to the achievement of the objectives.
