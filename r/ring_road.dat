50|$|Construction {{of fully}} {{circumferential}} <b>ring</b> <b>roads</b> has generally occurred more recently, {{beginning in the}} 1960s in many areas, when the U.S. Interstate Highway System and similar-quality roads elsewhere were designed. Ring roads have now been built around numerous cities and metropolitan areas, including cities with multiple <b>ring</b> <b>roads,</b> irregularly shaped <b>ring</b> <b>roads,</b> and <b>ring</b> <b>roads</b> made up of various other long-distance roads.|$|R
50|$|Delhi {{features}} two <b>ring</b> <b>roads,</b> a main one and {{an outer}} one. The two <b>ring</b> <b>roads</b> have a combined length of 87 km.|$|R

5|$|St. Christopher Bastion – a two-tiered {{pentagonal}} bastion, today breached to {{make way}} for the Valletta <b>ring</b> <b>road.</b> The upper part contains the Lower Barrakka Gardens, while the lower part contains the Siege Bell War Memorial and the Monument to the Unknown Soldier. A low battery was built near the bastion in the 1680s, but most of it was dismantled {{to make way}} for the <b>ring</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} how configurations of urban railroads and highways influenced urban form in Chinese cities since 1990. Each radial highway displaces at least 5 percent of central city population to surrounding regions and <b>ring</b> <b>roads</b> displace an additional 20 percent. Each radial railroad displaces 26 percent of central city industrial GDP with <b>ring</b> <b>roads</b> displacing an additional 50 percent. The production of goods with high weight-to-value ratios is unresponsive to transport yet those with medium and low weight-to-value ratios decentralize {{in response to}} radial railroads and <b>ring</b> <b>roads.</b> Historical transportation infrastructure provides identifying variation in more recent measures of infrastructure...|$|R
5|$|Didsbury {{is close}} to {{junction}} 5 of Manchester's <b>ring</b> <b>road,</b> the M60 motorway. Manchester Airport, the busiest airport in the UK outside London, is about 4miles (6.5km) to the south.|$|E
5|$|Euston Road is a road in Central London {{that runs}} from Marylebone Road to King's Cross. It {{is part of the}} London Inner <b>Ring</b> <b>Road</b> and forms part of the London {{congestion}} charge zone boundary.|$|E
5|$|The A57 and A61 {{roads are}} the major trunk roads through Sheffield. These run east–west and north–south respectively, {{crossing}} in the city centre, from where the other major roads generally radiate spoke-like. An inner <b>ring</b> <b>road,</b> mostly constructed in the 1970s and extended in 2007 to form a complete ring, allows traffic to avoid the city centre, and an outer <b>ring</b> <b>road</b> runs to the east, south east and north, nearer {{the edge of the}} city, but does not serve the western side of Sheffield.|$|E
50|$|The main {{objective}} of the package was to move road traffic to the <b>ring</b> <b>roads,</b> {{reducing the amount of}} traffic in the city center and freeing up capacity in the main arteries. In the 1990s, a number of tunnels were built, and the <b>ring</b> <b>roads</b> improved. During the 2000s the focus was moved towards the arteries.|$|R

5|$|During a light {{snow fall}} of December 2009, Basingstoke and the {{surrounding}} area {{was one of the worst}} hit regions in the United Kingdom, where an estimated 3000 motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles around the town and on the <b>ring</b> <b>road</b> during the evening rush hour of the Christmas holidays.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, the Airport Drive {{extension}} was completed, {{creating a}} second major {{link to the}} airport. The link starts at the M80 Western <b>Ring</b> <b>Road</b> and provides direct access to Melrose Drive 1.5 kilometres from the terminal area.|$|E
5|$|Pentonville Road is a road in Central London {{that runs}} {{west to east}} from Kings Cross to City Road at The Angel, Islington. The road {{is part of the}} London Inner <b>Ring</b> <b>Road</b> and part of the {{boundary}} of the London congestion charge zone.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} how configurations of urban railroads and highways influenced urban form in Chinese cities since 1990. Each radial highway displaces about 4 percent of central city population to surrounding regions and <b>ring</b> <b>roads</b> displace about an additional 20 percent, with stronger {{effects in the}} richer coastal and central regions. Each radial railroad reduces central city industrial GDP by about 20 percent, with <b>ring</b> <b>roads</b> displacing an additional 50 percent. Similar estimates for the locations of manufacturing jobs and residential location of manufacturing workers is evidence that radial highways decentralize service sector activity, radial railroads decentralize industrial activity and <b>ring</b> <b>roads</b> decentralize both. Historical transportation infrastructure provides identifying variation in more recent measures of infrastructure...|$|R

5|$|Euston Station is {{set back}} from Euston Square and Euston Road on the London Inner <b>Ring</b> <b>Road,</b> between Cardington Street and Eversholt Street in the London Borough of Camden. It is one of 19 {{stations}} {{in the country that}} are managed by Network Rail. As of 2016, it is the fifth-busiest station in Britain and the busiest inter-city passenger terminal in the country. It is the sixth-busiest terminus in London by entries and exits.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, the 1950s and 1960s {{saw many}} large scale {{developments}} in the city. The Sheffield Tramway was closed, and {{a new system of}} roads, including the Inner <b>Ring</b> <b>Road,</b> were laid out. Also at this time many of the old slums were cleared and replaced with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats, and the Gleadless Valley estate.|$|E

50|$|Roads in Kuwait {{are well}} {{maintained}} and mostly paved. Roadways {{extend up to}} 5,749 km, of which 4,887 km is paved. As of 2000, there were about 552,400 passenger cars and 167,800 commercial vehicles. On major <b>roads</b> like the <b>ring</b> <b>roads,</b> the maximum speed is 120 km/h. There are cameras on all major <b>roads,</b> highways, <b>ring</b> <b>roads</b> and near traffic lights. The Kuwaiti government spends nearly 450 million USD for these cameras.|$|R
5|$|In 2015, Transport for London {{announced}} {{its intention to}} close one lane in each direction on Euston Road between 2020 and 2026 to accommodate work on High Speed 2. The decision was condemned by Camden Borough Council as it could affect business and cost more than £1 billion in lost revenue. The Automobile Association said the works were the largest ever proposed in London and would affect far more than local traffic due to its Inner <b>Ring</b> <b>Road</b> status.|$|E

The term 'ring road' is occasionally - and inaccurately - used interchangeably with the term 'bypass'.|$|R
