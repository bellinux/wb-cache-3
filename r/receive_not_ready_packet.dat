40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} the Multi-Channel Flow-Aware Medium Access Control protocol, or (MFLAMA), an energy-efficient, schedule-based, multi-channel medium-access control (MAC) protocol designed for data gathering applications in wire-less sensor networks. MFLAMA improves the channel utiliza-tion by establishing collision-free transmission schedules across multiple channels. Energy efficiency {{is achieved by}} preventing packet collisions, idle listening, and transmissions to a node that is <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> to <b>receive</b> <b>packets.</b> We evaluate MFLAMA through extensive simulations and quantify the improvement in channel utilization {{through the use of}} multiple channels. Our results indicate that as we increase the number of orthogonal channels used for communication, there is significant improvement in channel utilization and queueing delay. However, we notice a “diminishing returns ” effect as we increase the number of channels, i. e., the performance improvements observed decrease with the number of channels beyond a certain threshold. This threshold depends on the topology and traffic flow patterns being used. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop the}} theory behind {{wireless}} MAC layer multicast and obtain throughput optimal transmission policies that provide desired loss and power characteristics. Key idea is to exploit the broadcast nature of wireless channel, i. e, a sender can reach all the receivers in a MAC layer multicast group with a single transmission. Through the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions provides a possible approach to improve {{the efficiency of the}} multicast communication, it also imposes critical challenges. A multicast specific challenge is that some but not all the receivers may be ready to receive on account of the interference caused by the transmissions in their neighborhood. The readiness state of a receiver depends on the network load. A transmission policy, which does not transmit until all the receivers are ready may have to wait long and hence it may provide low system throughput. On the other hand, if the sender transmits when only a few receivers are ready, then the transmitted packet will be lost at the receivers that were <b>not</b> <b>ready.</b> This <b>packet</b> loss may not be acceptable. Hence, the policy decision in this case is when should a sender transmit. Further, a sender may achieve required loss characteristics by transmitting a packet several times till sufficient number of receivers receive the packet. But additional power consumption in this case at the sender imposes a limit on the number of such transmissions. We consider a single multicast session in isolation. The impact of the network on the multicast session is modeled by considering random receiver readiness states. In each slot, we assume that a receiver is ready with probability (w. p.) p. Further, the number of arrivals in each slot is assumed to be iid with expectation denoted by λ...|$|R
