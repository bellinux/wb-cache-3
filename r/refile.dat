5|$|Circuit Judge Jon I. Gordon {{dismissed}} the lawsuit without prejudice in November requesting the plaintiffs <b>refile</b> with a clarified complaint. An amended complaint was {{filed by the}} three franchises a month later. In response to a motion to dismiss filed by the parent company, the judge ruled in January 2009 in favor of Burger King. In his decision, Judge Gordon stated that the franchise contract clearly does provide Burger King the right to establish minimum hours standards for its franchises. After purchase of the company by 3G, Burger King conceded to the franchises request the mandate be changed to a recommendation and relaxed its position on the extended hours.|$|E

25|$|Generally, a {{corporation}} sued in {{the jurisdiction of}} its headquarters is not entitled to seek an FNC dismissal. Thus if an American corporation is sued {{in an area where}} it only transacts business but not where it has its headquarters, and the court dismisses based upon FNC, the plaintiff may <b>refile</b> the action in the jurisdiction of the corporation’s headquarters.|$|E
25|$|Hermann {{was found}} not guilty of {{destroying}} public documents in 1907, but remained under indictment for collusion of a land deal in the Blue Mountain Forest Reserve in Oregon. A trial was held on that charge in 1910 and ended in a hung jury. U.S. District Attorney Francis J. Heney declined to <b>refile</b> charges. In 1932, Franklin Roosevelt's Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes, exonerated Hermann of any wrongdoing.|$|E
25|$|On August 27, 2003, Oklahoma's Attorney General, Drew Edmondson, filed a 15-count {{indictment}} against Ebbers.

These charges were dropped, {{with the right}} to <b>refile</b> retained, on November 20, 2003.

The judge initially dismissed the case in September 2011, but allowed the plaintiffs opportunity to <b>refile</b> at a later time. In 2012 Johnson and Johnson proposed a settlement with the shareholders, whereby the company would institute new oversight, quality and compliance procedures binding for five years.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the civil-rights}} claim {{included}} {{a violation of}} Section 1983, the city successfully petitioned for removal to federal court. After the Rasmussens stipulated to dropping the federal claim with prejudice, {{they were allowed to}} <b>refile</b> an amended claim in state court, which they did at the beginning of 2011. In state court, the city was found to be immune from liability for all of the claims except the civil rights violation. When the Rasmussens filed an amended complaint restricting it to only the civil rights claim, the judge dismissed it in August because he believed that their stipulation in federal court earlier barred them from doing so.|$|E
25|$|Established {{inside the}} United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the Panel is tasked with {{evaluating}} {{the conclusion of}} the Secretary of the Treasury that a company is in (or in danger of) default. The Panel consists of three bankruptcy judges drawn from the District of Delaware, all of whom are appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In his appointments, the Chief Judge is instructed to weigh the financial expertise of the candidates. If the Panel concurs with the Secretary, the company in question is permitted to be placed into receivership; if they do not concur, the Secretary has an opportunity to amend and <b>refile</b> his or her petition. In the event that a Panel decision is appealed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has jurisdiction; in the event of further appeal, a writ of certiorari may be filed with the United States Supreme Court. In all appellate events, the scope of review is limited to whether the decision of the Secretary that a company is in (or in danger of) default is supported by substantial evidence.|$|E

500|$|The villagers of Glod, Romania, took {{legal action}} against the {{producers}} of Borat, complaining that they were lied to {{about the nature of}} the filming and they were portrayed as incestuous and ignorant. Some said they were paid only three lei (about US$1.28 in 2004) each, while others stated they were paid between $70 and $100 each, which did not cover their expenses. [...] They are asking for $38 million in damages. One lawsuit was thrown out by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in a hearing in early December 2006 on the ground that the allegations in the complaint were too vague. The litigants said they planned to <b>refile.</b>|$|E
500|$|Later that year, while Destiny's Child was {{completing}} their third album Survivor, Rowland {{appeared on the}} remix of Avant's single [...] "Separated". Survivor, which channeled the turmoil the band underwent, spawned its lead single of the same name, which {{was a response to}} the experience. The song went on to win a Grammy Award for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The themes of [...] "Survivor", however, caused Luckett and Roberson to <b>refile</b> their lawsuit; the proceedings were eventually settled in June 2002. Meanwhile, the album was released in May 2001, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold. To date, Survivor has sold over twelve million copies worldwide, over forty percent of which were sold in the US alone. The album also spawned the number-one hit [...] "Bootylicious". After releasing their remix album This Is the Remix in 2002, the group announced their temporary break-up to pursue solo projects.|$|E
500|$|On October 27, {{the defense}} {{attorneys}} again said {{that they wanted to}} move the venue for the trial outside Cameron County because of all the publicity the case had received. They claimed it was impossible to select an impartial jury in Brownsville because of the amount of information the press had released against the defendants. The judge said he would announce his decision on November 2. On the same day, a grand jury reindicted Cisneros and Martínez on capital murder. Prosecutors had presented the evidence to a second grand jury and issued a revised indictment. A clear distinction {{between the first and second}} indictment was the change of the word [...] "caused" [...] to [...] "committed". Because a new indictment was issued, Cisneros, Martínez, and Garza pleaded not-guilty for a second time, forcing the court proceedings to be pushed back from their original dates. A pretrial hearing scheduled for November 2 dlayed. At least 42 motions were filed by the defendants when the first indictment was made, and the second indictment meant that they had to <b>refile</b> all the motions by November 12.|$|E

500|$|The debate {{started in}} 1999 with an {{exchange}} of letters in Scientific American between Walter L. Wagner, and F. Wilczek, Institute for Advanced Study, {{in response to a}} previous article by M. Mukerjee. The media attention unfolded with an article in U.K. Sunday Times of July 18, 1999 by J. Leake, closely followed by articles in the U.S. media. The controversy mostly ended with the report of a committee convened by the director of Brookhaven National Laboratory, J. H. Marburger, ostensibly ruling out the catastrophic scenarios depicted. However, the report left open the possibility that relativistic cosmic ray impact products might behave differently while transiting earth compared to [...] "at rest" [...] RHIC products; and the possibility that the qualitative difference between high-E proton collisions with earth or the moon might be different than gold on gold collisions at the RHIC. Wagner tried subsequently to stop full energy collision at RHIC by filing Federal lawsuits in San Francisco and New York City, but without success. The New York suit was dismissed on the technicality that the San Francisco suit was the preferred forum. The San Francisco suit was dismissed, but with leave to <b>refile</b> if additional information was developed and presented to the court.|$|E
500|$|With Walls and Bridges {{coming out}} first, Lennon had reneged on his deal with Levy, and Levy {{threatened}} to <b>refile</b> his lawsuit, but Lennon explained to Levy what had happened, and {{assured him that}} the covers album was indeed in the works. Levy gave Lennon use of his farm in upstate New York to rehearse material. Lennon then recalled the session musicians from Walls and Bridges to complete the oldies tracks. Several tracks never made it past the rehearsal stage: [...] "C'mon Everybody", [...] "Thirty Days", [...] "That'll Be the Day" [...] – the band also played a few impromptu jams. On 21 October, Lennon went into Record Plant East, completing the oldies tracks in a few days. Lennon wanted the musicians {{to stay close to}} the original arrangements of the songs, apart from [...] "Do You Wanna Dance?". Mixing and editing lasted until mid-November. To assure him progress was being made, Lennon gave Levy a rough tape of the sessions to review. Levy took the tapes and pressed his own version of the album called [...] on his record label, Adam VIII, then proceeded to sue Lennon, EMI and Capitol for $42 million for breach of contract. Capitol/EMI quickly sought an injunction. After two trials, in which Lennon had to convince the court of the difference between a rough version and a final take, Levy won $6,795 in damages, and Lennon won $144,700, in February 1976. The album was originally scheduled for release in April 1975, however, in February 1975, Capitol Records rush-released the official Rock 'n' Roll as a Capitol [...] "budget" [...] album (prefix code SK—one dollar cheaper than the usual releases) to counteract sales of the Levy album.|$|E
2500|$|The District Court then {{granted the}} {{defendants}}' motions to dismiss. [...] The claims against the State defendants were barred by their Eleventh Amendment immunity, but were dismissed without prejudice so the plaintiffs could <b>refile</b> the claims in state court.

NOM appealed to federal court, who ruled against them.|$|E
2500|$|Recorded in the {{documents}} of the complaint, Nungesser claimed Sulkowicz's allegation of rape was false, citing as evidence her counterintuitive behavior, such as friendly texts Sulkowicz sent Nungesser days after the alleged attack occurred. The complaint argued Sulkowicz's allegation was made in response to unreciprocated desire for a serious relationship, therefore allowing the performance was harassment and a violation of his student rights. [...] When questioned about the lawsuit, Sulkowicz {{said that it was}} [...] "full of lies." [...] Federal District Court Judge Gregory H. Woods dismissed the lawsuit but allowed Nungesser to <b>refile</b> an amended suit, which was settled by Columbia in July 2017.|$|E
