25|$|Drum brakes {{are most}} common on utility {{bicycles}} in some countries, especially the Netherlands, {{and are also}} often found on freight bicycles and velomobiles. Older tandem bicycles often employed a <b>rear</b> <b>drum</b> brake as a drag brake.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{states that}} it filed 1000 patents during the {{development}} of the XW30 Prius. The concept of the powertrain largely carried over from the previous XW20 model, although the engine displacement was increased to 1.8 litres and the transaxle was changed to the THS III. Disc brakes replaced the North American model's <b>rear</b> <b>drum</b> brakes.|$|E
25|$|From 1982 through 2003, {{with the}} {{exception}} of several years, Honda produced a CB750 known as the Nighthawk 750. Early models were designated the CB750SC Nighthawk while later models were simply known as the Nighthawk 750. The Nighthawk 750SC had a 4-stroke engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, chain drive and has front disc and <b>rear</b> <b>drum</b> brakes.|$|E

25|$|Early {{versions}} used four speed manual transmission, whilst {{the current}} car is available with either six speed manual or five speed automatic transmission. The suspension system on all models uses a fully independent MacPherson strut front suspension, and a Twist-beam rear suspension. Most models use disc brakes {{at the front}} and <b>rear</b> <b>drum</b> brakes, although some recent models have all round disc brakes.|$|E
25|$|The “budget” {{model of}} the Hawk line up. It has front and <b>rear</b> <b>drum</b> brakes and spoked wheels with chrome rims. It is kick start only and the only {{instrument}} is a speedometer. It also has a slightly different and larger capacity fuel tank {{than the other two}} models. Due to the removal of certain components the Hawk I is actually 10 kg lighter than the more premium Hawk II.|$|E
25|$|The first {{motorcycles}} to use {{disc brakes}} were racing vehicles. MV Agusta {{was the first}} to offer a front disc brake motorcycle to the public on a small scale in 1965, on their relatively expensive 600 touring motorcycle, using a mechanical brake linkage. In 1969 Honda introduced the more affordable CB750, which had a single hydraulically-actuated front disc brake (and a <b>rear</b> <b>drum</b> brake), and which sold in huge numbers. Disc brakes are now common on motorcycles, mopeds and even mountain bikes.|$|E
50|$|The Type 52 was {{powered by}} a single 12 volt {{electric}} motor with front and reverse. Braking was done by way of expanding wooden shoes at the front and <b>rear</b> <b>drums.</b>|$|R
50|$|All {{variants}} of the S30 have a four-wheel independent suspension consisting of MacPherson struts in front (borrowed from the Nissan Laurel C30) and Chapman struts in back. Front disc brakes and <b>rear</b> <b>drums</b> were standard.|$|R
50|$|All models include safety {{features}} such as ABS with EBD and BA. Additional features include TCS and VSC. All models include front ventilated and rear disc brakes {{with the exception of}} 1.8X 2WD (which include <b>rear</b> <b>drums).</b>|$|R
25|$|The front {{suspension}} {{is short}} and long control arms with coil springs; the rear suspension is a four-link design with coil springs. A torque-arm design rear suspension replaced the four-link design starting with the 1976 models. The Astre is a rear wheel drive vehicle with a live rear axle. Steering is of a recirculating ball type with a power assist option. The brake system features front disc brakes with solid rotors, and <b>rear</b> <b>drum</b> brakes. Power assist was optional starting in the 1975 model year.|$|E
25|$|The Taurus {{received}} another redesign for 2000, which replaced {{many of the}} oval-derived design {{elements of}} the previous model with sharper creases and corners, an aspect of Ford's New Edge styling language. To reduce the car's price and keep it competitive, Ford reduced costs on the car in 1999, such as giving the Taurus sedan <b>rear</b> <b>drum</b> brakes on ABS equipped vehicles (previously, upgrading to ABS included the addition of rear disc brakes), eliminating the dual exhaust on the higher end models, and trimming many other small features.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 the Caprice {{received}} new engines, {{including an}} optional detuned {{version of the}} Corvette's LT1 350cuin (5.7L) engine that put out 260hp (194kW) and 330lb·ft (447N·m) of torque. The standard engine in all sedans, including the 9C1 police cars, was the , L99 263 (4.3L) V8. TheLT1 was optional in the 9C1 police package and standard in the wagon. The LT1350 was standard in the civilian sedans {{with the addition of}} the B4U towing package. The towing package also gave a heavy duty suspension nearly identical to the 9C1 police car suspension, 2.93 gears, heavy duty cooling, heavy duty <b>rear</b> <b>drum</b> brakes and limited-slip differential. The 1994 Caprice's interior had a redesign which featured a Camaro steering wheel, digital speedometer and a new console.|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{development}} engineers {{aimed for}} full-size American car ride qualities with European handling. Later torque-arm rear suspension eliminated rear wheel hop under panic braking. Brakes (front discs, <b>rear</b> <b>drums)</b> copy an Opel design, with 10 in diameter single-piston solid rotors, 9 in drums and 70/30 front/rear braking distribution.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, {{only the}} 3K powered 2-door KE20 was {{available}} as a sedan and wagon / panelvan. The brakes were single system with no booster, solid discs {{on the front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>drums.</b> Front sway bar but no rear sway bar. Parts are not compatible with later models.|$|R
5000|$|All models now {{came with}} disc brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the back, {{controlled}} using a dual circuit system and brake booster. This was a progression from the situation with the Rekord A, in respect of which only had servoassisted discbrakes, not the <b>rear</b> <b>drums.</b> Discbrakes on Rekord A was standard on coupe and 4-door De Luxe, and option on sedan during 1965 ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} body style for the Storm was a three-door hatchback. The 1990 and 1991 hatchbacks were {{produced}} in two trim packages, but all Storms shared front disc and <b>rear</b> <b>drum</b> brakes {{and had an}} anti-sway bar to tighten the front suspension. The base model was priced at $10,390, and the GSi was $11,650.USD ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{brakes on}} the new TL have been {{increased}} in size, from the older [...] front disc and [...] rear disc to the now Ridgeline-sized [...] front discs and [...] rear disc, still incorporating an internal <b>rear</b> <b>drum</b> e-brake while maintaining hydraulic discs for the foot applied brakes. The bolt pattern on the car {{is no longer a}} 5 x [...] but a 5 x [...] for this generation.|$|E
2500|$|The CB400T Dream was {{introduced}} in 1977. It has alloy and steel compound Comstar wheels. Fuelling is provided by 32mm Keihin carburettors. Braking is provided by a single hydraulic front disc and an expanding <b>rear</b> <b>drum.</b> The Dream was also available in a [...] CB250T version {{to comply with the}} UK learner regulations at the time. Period reviews stated the bike was a mid-range tourer with rider comfort being considered one of its best attributes.|$|E
5000|$|The initial {{four-cylinder engine}} range {{included}} 1.1-litre (...) , 1.3-litre (...) and 1.5-litre (...) petrol engines, which were reasonably refined and economical. Suspension was independent all-round, {{the braking system}} comprised front discs and <b>rear</b> <b>drums</b> and the wheels measured 13-inch in diameter. Gearboxes ranged from a standard four-speed manual (five-speed optional on CL models) and an optional three-speed Volkswagen-derived automatic. Its boot capacity ranged from 330 to 1,100 litres.|$|R
5000|$|For 1970 {{numerous}} changes {{came with}} the fuel-injected 1800E, which had the B20E engine with Bosch D-Jetronic fuel injection and a revised camshaft, and produced [...] without sacrificing fuel economy. Top speed was around 190 km/h and acceleration from 0-100 km/h (0-62.1 mph) took 9.5 seconds. In addition, the 1970 model was the first 1800 with four-wheel disc brakes; until then the 1800 series had front discs and <b>rear</b> <b>drums.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{designed}} double-drum winch {{is applied}} to the development of Liwan 3 - 1 gas field of the South China Sea for lowering mooring anchor chains, which is composed of motor, brake, reducer, front and <b>rear</b> <b>drums,</b> two-stage gear transmission devices, rack and base. There is an intermediate axle between two drums of the winch. On the intermediate axle there are two gears, a large one and a small one. The large gear installed on the intermediate axle goes into mesh with the pinion gear installed on the output shaft of reducer, and the small gear installed on intermediate axle meshes with the large gears installed on the front and <b>rear</b> <b>drums</b> separately. The speed of rotate from the motor is sent to the two-stage gear transmission devices by the reducer, to realize two drums rotate simultaneously in the same direction. Compared to the double-drum winch of multi-motor synchronous drive, the designed double-drum winch can be more reliable and avoid the difficult technical problems of multi-motor synchronous drive and control in a large extent...|$|R

All other models remained the same. Bench seats for 1973 now featured low backs with separate head rests to increase rear visibility. The high back bucket seats were still available on the two-door models. The hood release was moved to inside, for increased security. Radial tires were also a new option, and offered longer tread life and better road manners. The standard engine remained as the 250 CID inline-six for all models, except the station wagons and Sport which used the 302-2V. Engine options also remained the same, and all engines now had their compression ratio dropped to 8.0:1. Power for all engines was slightly lower than in 1972. The 351 CJ continued {{to be the only}} high-performance engine and only saw a [...] drop from 1972, although performance decreased again due to the weight increase. Police package Torinos had all the engine options of the civilian models while the [...] "Interceptor" [...] package featured a 460-4V new for 1973.

50|$|For {{the first}} model year, the 810 Deluxe was the only version to receive the {{five-speed}} manual, while the luxurious 810 Maxima only came with a three-speed automatic. The Maxima's introduction to North America followed the successful introduction of the Nissan S30, and used the same engine and transmission while offering luxurious accommodations and four doors. The sedans have independent rear suspension while the wagon has a leaf sprung live rear axle. The wagon also received <b>rear</b> <b>drums</b> rather than disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|The NA {{series was}} {{released}} to Australia during January 1983 in short- (SWB) and long-wheelbase (LWB) three-door wagon formats, with the 2.6-liter petrol or 2.3-liter turbo diesel, both mated to a five-speed KM145 manual transmission. Brakes were ventilated front discs and <b>rear</b> <b>drums.</b> The five-door, high-roof LWB model {{was introduced in}} May 1984 with the same powertrain options. The five-door offered a luxury Superwagon trim and also had a shorter final drive than the SWB models, {{to make up for}} the increased weight.|$|R
