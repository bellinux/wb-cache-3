50|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} the station, the train heads {{straight}} for 3 mi, until coming into some hills. Shortly thereafter, the train crosses Ferguson's Trestle (MP 285.87), named {{for a man who}} was hung from a locomotive there. The original trestle was featured in the 1988 TV movie Where The Hell's That Gold? starring Willie Nelson and Delta Burke. In filming, a planned explosion ended up getting out of hand and the bridge was burned down. Traffic was halted for a week while the C&TS built a temporary bridge; the following winter it rebuilt the trestle to match the original. About three miles (5 km) later, the train makes the first of 11 crossings into New Mexico, and climbs a ledge up to a lava mesa. Lava (291.55) has the old water tank from Antonito which was moved here in 1971. The track goes around a horseshoe curve which is also used as a reversing loop to turn the <b>rotary</b> <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> trains from Chama. The Cumbres and Toltec has two rotary snowplows, Rotary OM and Rotary OY.|$|E
5000|$|Plans to {{turn the}} station into a museum were first brought forward during the centennial celebration of the driving of the golden spike in 1969. It was not until 1971 when Amtrak {{formally}} took over passenger operations through Ogden that these plans were taken seriously. The station building {{was turned over to}} Ogden City on a 50-year lease in 1977 and renovations were begun to house the planned museums. At the dedication ceremony in 1978, Union Pacific ran their famous UP 8444 (now number 844) {{at the head of a}} special passenger train from Cheyenne, Wyoming, to the new museum. They also donated a steam derrick (built by Industrial Works) and a steam <b>rotary</b> <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> (built by ALCO in 1912), which were the last pieces of steam-powered equipment in use on the Union Pacific System. In 1988 the State of Utah designated the Union Station as the Utah State Railroad Museum to handle the railroad artifacts. This spurred a series of donations by the Union Pacific through the years, including UP 6916, a DD40AX [...] "Centennial" [...] (one of the largest locomotives ever built), and D&RGW 5371, the only SD40-T2 [...] "Tunnel Motor" [...] in its original Denver & Rio Grande Western paint scheme. Railroad equipment was brought in from other places, like UP 833, and FEF3 class steam locomotive and the largest to be moved by truck, which was moved from Salt Lake City's Pioneer Park.|$|E

50|$|Today <b>snow</b> <b>plows</b> are {{produced}} by numerous companies {{around the world and}} available for different kinds of vehicles such as service trucks, pickup trucks, SUVs and ATVs. They are installed using model specific or universal hardware and mount to the frame of the vehicle to ensure durable connection. There are manual, power and hydraulic operating <b>snow</b> <b>plows.</b> All necessary mounting hardware usually comes in set with a <b>plow.</b> <b>Snow</b> <b>plow</b> blades are available in various sizes depending on a vehicle type. Service trucks usually use a blade sized 96 in and more. Common blade size for pickup trucks and full size SUVs is 78 - 96 in. Smaller ATV <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> blades are 48 - 78 in wide.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>snow</b> <b>plows</b> were horse-drawn wedge-plows made of wood. With {{the advent}} of the automobile, a number of inventors set about to improve {{existing}} <b>snow</b> <b>plows.</b> In the US, the [...] "snow-clearer" [...] {{is said to have been}} patented as early as the 1840s, for railways. The first <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> ever built specifically for use with motor equipment was in 1913. It was manufactured by Good Roads Machinery in Kennett Square, PA. and was designed to meet the exacting requirements outlined by engineers of the New York City Street Cleaning Bureau. [...] Good Roads is therefore unofficially credited as the originator of the modern <b>snow</b> <b>plow,</b> though their horse drawn steel blade road graders were used to clear roads of snow as early as the company's founding in 1878 under their original name American Road Machinery. [...] Good Roads patented the first four-wheel grader in 1889 thus making it the first pull grading apparatus patented in the United States. [...] Unlike most early <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> manufacturers, Good Roads continues to manufacture snow removal equipment today under the name Good Roads Godwin, now located in Dunn, North Carolina. In the early 1920s Good Roads often advertised in The American City magazine that [...] "...three out of every four <b>snow</b> <b>plows</b> in use throughout the whole United States are Good Roads Champions." [...] By the mid-1920s Good Roads was manufacturing <b>snow</b> <b>plows</b> of various shapes and sizes for use on a wide variety of motorized equipment. Other <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> manufactures began to follow suit as motorized plows were proven more efficient than other methods of snow removal.|$|R
40|$|The {{improvement}} of efficient <b>snow</b> <b>plowing</b> {{is still a}} big problem in the heavy snow regions. This paper is concerned with gaining a greater capacity of <b>snow</b> <b>plowing,</b> not by increasing the engine power, but only by using an automatic transmission. We have studied a hydro-mechanical transmission (HMT) for this purpose. The HMT requires such complicated investigations in design, {{that it has been}} seldom used except in military or aviation fields. A case of an input of 200 PS was investigated and the results were shown including a general view of the HMT which is almost the same size as a simple mechanical transmission. It was proved by 300 hrs of <b>snow</b> <b>plowing</b> tests, that the HMT increases the <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> 2 ̆ 7 s capacity 20...|$|R

40|$|Snow and ice {{removal and}} {{clearing}} roadways after a winter storm account for {{major portion of}} roadway agencies located in snowy region’s maintenance budget. With the decreasing funds and increasing demand from the motoring public for mobility, roadway agencies are continuously looking for new innovative approaches for winter maintenance operations. One of {{the main focus of}} these approaches include performance measures for winter maintenance. This is specifically important when roadway agencies use contractors to perform winter maintenance tasks. In this study, two performance measures are studied extensively. These include, visual pavement condition behind the <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> and pavement friction behind the <b>snow</b> <b>plow.</b> Visual pavement condition was observed and recorded into one of five categories while driving behind a <b>snow</b> <b>plow.</b> Pavement friction behind <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> is measured using a Continuous Friction Measuring (CFT) device. Since visual pavement condition provides driver’s perception of the winter driving condition and friction measurements provide an objective measurement of the safety of the roadway under winter condition, a correlation of these provides a basic guideline for winter maintenance and performance measurement of winter maintenance. During the past winter, multiple data collection cycles were performed behind different type of <b>snow</b> <b>plows</b> along I- 96 in Livingston County. These preliminary data was used to obtain relationships between winter storm severity, <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> type and the selected performance measures...|$|R
