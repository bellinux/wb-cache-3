The aqueous phase contains 50 wt. % of a media component for the algae culture medium. Trace elements {{are added to the}} aqueous phase. The algae culture is a microalgae culture such as Phaeodactylum tricornutum culture or Haematococcus pluvialis culture or Chlorella sorokiniana culture or Chlorella vulgaris culture or Platymonas subcordiformis culture or Tetraselmis suecica culture or Nannochloropsis oculata culture, Nannochloropsis limnetica culture or Phormidium species culture or Pseudoanabaena species culture or Dunaliella species culture or Monodus subterraneus isochrysis species culture.

To solve the definition problem of the interface between a <b>rotating</b> <b>disk</b> and a stationary plate in the computational simulation, a tiny gap is set between the <b>rotating</b> <b>disk</b> and the stationary plate.

The swirling flow around the <b>rotating</b> <b>disk</b> obstructs the impinging jet flow to penetrate into the interfacial contact zone and forces the wall jet across the <b>rotating</b> <b>disk</b> to flow along transverse directions. For the given jet impinging velocity and nozzle orientation, as the disk rotational speed increases, the effect of the <b>rotating</b> <b>disk</b> on the impinging jet flow behaves more significantly.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a topology optimization framework {{to design the}} material distribution of a functionally graded <b>rotating</b> <b>disk</b> considering mechanical stress constraints. In {{the case of a}} <b>rotating</b> <b>disk,</b> under body forces, the problem of interest consists of maximizing the rotating inertia subjected to a global stress constraint. In FGMs, due to the existence of a microstructure, it is necessary to consider the micro-stress, which is computed by a mechanical concentration factor. Thus, a p-norm of the von-Mises stress criteria is applied to the micro-stress. To design a functionally graded material distribution, a material model based on interpolation of the Hashin-Strikhman upper and lower bounds is considered. In consistency with the framework adopted herein, the so-called "continuous approximation of material distribution" (CAMD) approach is adopted, which considers a continuous distribution of the design variable inside the finite element.

The influence of transmembrane pressure (TMP), <b>disk</b> <b>rotating</b> speed, and <b>disk</b> geometry on permeate flux and oil recovery has been studied. Hydrophilic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes with average pore size 0. 15 mu m and polyethersulfone (PES) membranes with 50 kDa molecular weight cut off (MWCO) were used.

This study demonstrated that hydrophilic membranes were suitable for demulsification of linseed oil-in-water emulsion. The linseed oil droplets in the emulsions could be separated by concentration tests due to the coalescence of oil droplets in the concentration polarization layer. For an initial oil mass of 46. 5 g, 35. 2 g supernatant oil was obtained owing to oil droplets coalescence. This supernatant oil represented a recovery of 76 %.
