5|$|Robert Nathan's Portrait of Jennie, as novel, or film, {{is another}} obvious comparison, {{although}} Jennie, as a ghost, travels time in one direction, not <b>randomly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann was {{reportedly}} able to memorize {{the pages of}} telephone directories, entertaining friends by asking them to <b>randomly</b> call out page numbers, and then reciting the names, addresses and numbers therein.|$|E
5|$|When Fortress mode is selected, {{the player}} {{is given the}} option to choose the embark {{location}} in the world. The player can consider the environment, elevations, biome, soil types and mineral concentrations which can pose significant challenges to the development or survival of the fortress. Customizing the colony's supplies, domestic animals and skills are available, but each dwarf's mental and physical attributes are <b>randomly</b> generated. The game describes in detail each dwarf's physical appearance, like hair and facial features. The mental abilities, individual preferences and desires are also <b>randomly</b> generated. Each dwarf's relationships with others and the deities they worship can be viewed.|$|E
5|$|A Balthier figurine {{was sold}} <b>randomly</b> in Japanese sets of Final Fantasy XII characters. Square Enix {{released}} a Sculpture Arts set of Balthier and Fran escaping {{the palace of}} Rabanastre in 2008. A full-colored action figure of Balthier has also been displayed in the Square Enix Japan merchandise page.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{components}} of the cytosol are not separated into regions by cell membranes, these components do not always mix <b>randomly</b> and several levels of organization can localize specific molecules to defined sites within the cytosol.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{established}} the Metro Transit Police Department (MTPD) on June 4, 1976. MTPD police officers have jurisdiction and arrest powers for crimes that occur throughout the 1,500 square mile (3,900km2) Transit Zone that includes Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. In December 2010, MTPD began conducting random searches of carry-on bags for explosive and weapons at checkpoints located at <b>randomly</b> designated Metrorail stations.|$|E
5|$|Cycle detection, {{the problem}} of {{following}} a path in a functional graph to find a cycle in it, has applications in cryptography and computational number theory, as part of Pollard's rho algorithm for integer factorization and as a method for finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions. In these applications, ƒ is expected to behave randomly; Flajolet and Odlyzko study the graph-theoretic properties of the functional graphs arising from <b>randomly</b> chosen mappings. In particular, a form of the birthday paradox implies that, in a random functional graph with n vertices, the path starting from a <b>randomly</b> selected vertex will typically loop back on itself to form a cycle within O(√n) steps. Konyagin et al. have made analytical and computational progress on graph statistics.|$|E
5|$|Deformed matrices, {{consisting}} of <b>randomly</b> oriented nanochannels in a spongelike keratin matrix, create the diffuse non-iridescent blue colour of Ara ararauna, the blue-and-yellow macaw. Since the reflections {{are not all}} arranged in the same direction, the colours, while still magnificent, do not vary much with angle, so they are not iridescent.|$|E
5|$|DotA {{offers a}} variety of game modes, {{selected}} by the game host {{at the beginning of the}} match. The game modes dictate the difficulty of the scenario, as well as whether players can choose their hero or are assigned one <b>randomly.</b> Many game modes can be combined, allowing more flexible options.|$|E
5|$|Fallout 3 {{composer}} Inon Zur {{composed the}} {{score for the}} game. The game features three major in-game radio stations, spanning several genres of music in the radio waves: сountry, popular music from the 1940s and 1950s, jazz and classical. Each station has a set track list which repeats <b>randomly.</b> Music from the first two Fallout games, composed by Mark Morgan, {{is used in the}} game as well.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VIII also {{introduced}} interactive elements to complement Limit Break animations. These interactive sequences, which vary between character, weapon, and Limit Break range from <b>randomly</b> selected magic spells to precisely timed button inputs. Successfully completing an interactive sequence increases the resulting attack's potency.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, it was {{discovered}} that nine of the satellite galaxies lie in a plane that intersects the core of the Andromeda Galaxy; they are not <b>randomly</b> arranged as would be expected from independent interactions. This may indicate a common tidal origin for the satellites.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Lottery offered {{its first}} Millionaire Raffle; 330,000 tickets were sold at $20 each, after which numbers were <b>randomly</b> drawn to win up to $1 million. The Lottery has held Millionaire Raffles irregularly: some during spring; but most {{have been drawn}} on New Years Day. Rules vary with each raffle; the top prize is usually $1million; generally, raffle prizes are paid in lump sum.|$|E
5|$|In coal seams, coal {{balls are}} {{completely}} surrounded by coal. They are often found <b>randomly</b> {{scattered throughout the}} seam in isolated groups, usually in {{the upper half of}} the seam. Their occurrence in coal seams can be either extremely sporadic or regular; many coal seams have been found to contain no coal balls, while others have been found to contain so many coal balls that miners avoid the area entirely.|$|E
5|$|Inglenook Sidings is {{an award-winning}} model railway train {{shunting}} puzzle created by Alan Wright for the Manchester Model Railway Society's 1978 show, {{based on the}} former Kilham Sidings on the Alnwick and Cornhill Railway. The aim of the puzzle {{is to create a}} train consisting of five of the eight wagons sitting in the sidings, in the order in which the wagons are <b>randomly</b> selected.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} {{received}} puzzles in the game involves arranging the pieces of a dialogue between the sculpted heads of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. The player listens to the <b>randomly</b> ordered statements made by each head, then decides how to chronologically arrange the statements to form a coherent conversation based on context.|$|E
5|$|Repeat {{this process}} {{a number of}} times, <b>randomly</b> {{reproducing}} each generation of marbles to form the next. The numbers of red and blue marbles picked each generation fluctuates; sometimes more red and sometimes more blue. This fluctuation is analogous to genetic drift– {{a change in the}} population's allele frequency resulting from a random variation in the distribution of alleles {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
5|$|Shards of Alara also debuted mythic rares (red-orange), which replace one {{in eight}} rare cards on average. There are also premium {{versions}} of every card with holographic foil, <b>randomly</b> inserted into some boosters {{in place of}} a common, which replace about one in seventy cards.|$|E
5|$|Targeting bore little {{resemblance}} to reality in that the sequence of attacks was uncoordinated and the targets were approved <b>randomly</b> – even illogically. The North's airfields, which, according to any rational targeting policy, should have been hit first in the campaign, were also off-limits.|$|E
5|$|Teams {{consist of}} 15 members who {{may come from}} {{different}} countries. Individuals may prearrange teams or sign up individually, in which case they are <b>randomly</b> grouped into appropriately sized teams. As of the 2013 contest, signup costs ran $19 per person with participation fees going towards Random Acts, a non-profit run by Collins that aims to encourage random acts of kindness.|$|E
5|$|The after-battle monster {{recruitment}} {{has been}} removed. In the original 1995 Super Famicon version of Dragon Quest VI, {{certain types of}} monsters can be <b>randomly</b> recruited if they are defeated with a Monster Master in the party. In the 2010 DS remake, this system has been removed, instead, there are certain Slimes that will join you once you accomplish a specific task. Lizzie still remains recruitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} {{mission was}} then toughened {{and made a}} bit less abstract by requiring teams {{to search for a}} toxic waste dump, map the location of partially buried <b>randomly</b> oriented toxic waste drums, identify the contents of each drum from the hazard labels found somewhere on the outside of each drum, and bring a sample back from one of the drums—all without any human intervention whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} no pause feature or motion controls, {{and there is}} no formal tutorial. Hidden between the puzzles are a few ciphers—incomprehensible text to be decoded through {{substitution}} cipher and other methods. The endless mode unlocks when the 100 puzzles are complete, and features a series of <b>randomly</b> generated levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetric}} key is <b>randomly</b> generated {{and will not}} assist other victims. At no point is the attacker's private key exposed to victims and the victim need only send a very small ciphertext (the encrypted symmetric-cipher key) to the attacker.|$|E
5|$|There {{are among}} other things four cadenzas for oboe, clarinet, bassoon and flute which run quite freely {{alongside}} one another, with no harmonic connection, and without my marking time. They are just like four streams of thought, each going its own way– differently and <b>randomly</b> for each performance– until they meet in a point of rest, as if flowing into a lock where they are united.|$|E
5|$|Truchet tiles are square tiles {{decorated}} with patterns {{so they do}} not have rotational symmetry; in 1704, Sébastien Truchet used a square tile split into two triangles of contrasting colours. These can tile the plane either periodically or <b>randomly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} Panzer Dragoon games, which are rail shooters, Panzer Dragoon Saga is a {{role-playing}} video game (RPG). The player controls the young mercenary Edge, who flies a powerful dragon. Gameplay {{is divided into}} three modes: traversing large areas on the dragon, battling enemies, and exploring on foot. The game uses a random encounter system, whereby battles are triggered <b>randomly</b> as the player flies.|$|E
5|$|Violent crime, {{including}} murder, {{has occurred}} on the trail in a few instances. Most have been crimes by non-hikers who crossed paths relatively <b>randomly</b> with the AT hiker-victims. The official website of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy {{points out that the}} number of violent crimes is extremely low when compared against the number of people (3 to 4 million) who hike on the trail every year.|$|E
5|$|When using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection {{for online}} multiplayer, the player can choose between a match with a random {{opponent}} {{from around the}} world, or a match with someone that the player has exchanged friend codes with. Worldwide matches are limited to two players, with the weather conditions being <b>randomly</b> generated and a map <b>randomly</b> chosen from a set list. Worldwide match players can choose if they want an opponent close to their skill level or to play against an opponent regardless of skill level. When playing with a friend, more options are opened up to allow greater customization of the match, such as the type of weather and {{the duration of the}} match. Voice chat is only supported when playing with a friend, and is unavailable during worldwide online play. However, Caulder can not be used in ONLINE multiplayer due to his extreme advantages.|$|E
25|$|Generate {{passwords}} <b>randomly</b> where feasible.|$|E
25|$|We <b>randomly</b> select an a (smaller than n): 47.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{symptoms}} can also occur <b>randomly</b> when panicked.|$|E
25|$|<b>Randomly</b> assign {{numbers to}} the blank {{cells in the}} grid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Randomly</b> select {{any one of}} the 3 vertex points.|$|E
25|$|<b>Randomly</b> select {{any point}} inside the {{triangle}} and consider that your current position.|$|E
