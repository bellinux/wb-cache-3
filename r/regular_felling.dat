At the appearance of their late victim the <b>regulars</b> <b>fell</b> back as though struck a blow.|$|R
60|$|At {{six o'clock}} another desperate attempt was made, but in vain; then the <b>regulars</b> <b>fell</b> back in disorder, but, {{for an hour}} and a half, the provincials and rangers kept up a fire, while their comrades removed the wounded. Abercromby had lost in killed, wounded, and missing 1944 {{officers}} and men, while the loss of the French was 377.|$|R

50|$|The first {{shots were}} fired just {{as the sun was}} rising at Lexington. Eight militiamen were killed, {{including}} Ensign Robert Munroe, their ranking officer. The British suffered only one casualty. The militia were outnumbered and fell back, and the regulars proceeded on to Concord, where they broke apart into companies to search for the supplies. At the North Bridge in Concord, approximately 400 militiamen engaged 100 regulars from three companies of the King's troops at about 11:00am, resulting in casualties on both sides. The outnumbered <b>regulars</b> <b>fell</b> back from the bridge and rejoined the main body of British forces in Concord.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new notion of twisted actions of inverse semigroups and show that they correspond bijectively to certain <b>regular</b> <b>Fell</b> bundles over inverse semigroups, yielding in this way a structure classification of such bundles. These include as special cases all the stable Fell bundles. Our definition of twisted actions properly generalizes a previous one introduced by Sieben and corresponds to Busby-Smith twisted actions in the group case. As an application we describe twisted etale groupoid C*-algebras in terms of crossed products by twisted actions of inverse semigroups and show that Sieben's twisted actions essentially correspond to twisted etale groupoids with topologically trivial twists.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the American Civil War in 1861, Anderson chose to follow his home state and the Confederate cause. On March 16 he was appointed a first lieutenant in the Regular Confederate Artillery. His first assignment was at Fort Morgan, guarding the entrance to Mobile Bay, Alabama. There he was given command a regular detachment, organized separately from the volunteer forces but attached to the 2nd Alabama Infantry, and was responsible for the installation's ordnance. His total force consisted of the remaining regular recruits from the Mount Vernon Arsenal in Alabama, and numbered only two officers and nine enlisted men. On November 9 Anderson entered the volunteer service for good, appointed a major in the 20th Alabama Infantry, and command of his <b>regulars</b> <b>fell</b> to 2nd Lt. Alfred M. O'Neal.|$|R
5000|$|Finkelstein {{tried to}} make use of Pataki's likely coattails by helming the {{campaign}} of David Cornstein for the state Comptroller slot being vacated by McCall. Cornstein, a successful businessman and Giuliani's appointed chief of Off-Track Betting, brought personal resources and a strong finance team to the table. He was a longtime ally of both the Mayor and Governor, with a City / Long Island base and unusual appeal as a Jewish Republican running as a moderate-conservative. But party <b>regulars</b> <b>fell</b> in decisively behind former Upstate Assemblyman John Faso, a onetime legislative leader for the GOP minority, and Cornstein abandoned his run in 2001. (Faso failed to expand his appeal beyond the limited Republican base, losing with 46.5% in November 2002; in 2006, Eliot Spitzer crushed him, Faso polling just 29.2% in his bid for Governor.) ...|$|R

One of our <b>regular</b> paper-carriers <b>fell</b> sick, and, at a pinch, Wan Lee {{was ordered to}} fill his place. To prevent mistakes, he was shown over the route the previous evening, and supplied at about daylight with the usual number of subscribers' copies. He returned, after an hour, in good spirits, and without the papers. He had delivered them all, he said.|$|R

50|$|Basden only {{became aware}} of the abatis after the British had crossed the bridge, but {{nevertheless}} led an advance up the hill. The British were unable to climb the icy slope {{in the face of the}} heavy fire and were beaten back. Basden himself was wounded in the leg, and Captain Johnston, leading the light company of the Royal Scots, was killed. The British <b>regulars</b> then <b>fell</b> back into the ravine through which the creek flowed and tried to drive the Americans from the hill with musket fire from behind trees, but the Americans firing from a height inflicted heavy casualties.|$|R
40|$|This study uses {{repeated}} {{cross-sectional data}} from 1982 to 2007 to understand labor force behavior of Japanese men, {{focusing on the}} increase in non-regular employment. I find that <b>regular</b> employment <b>fell</b> significantly for recent cohorts of less-educated men. Regular employment of single men and less-educated married men responded more to the business cycle than did regular employment of highly educated married men. Cohorts who finished their schooling in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s experienced a severe decline in regular employment at young ages, although this phenomenon was mainly observed among single men and not among married men...|$|R
25|$|Cleveland {{would come}} back to win the next two games, Game 3, a blowout where five Cavs scored in double figures, and Game 4 where James would punctuate the victory with a dunk over Garnett. James's {{shooting}} improved in the return to the Garden in Game 5, but received minimal help from his teammates as Rajon Rondo, Garnett, and Paul Pierce all scored over 20 points to push Boston over the top. Game 6 was an ugly affair, with both teams shooting under 40 percent, but a 32–12–6 performance by James was enough. Boston, the best road team in the <b>regular</b> season, <b>fell</b> to 0–6 on the road.|$|R
50|$|Despite being {{known as}} a Wigan band, only one member of Starsailor is {{actually}} from the town. The band met whilst studying Music at the Parsons Walk Campus of Wigan and Leigh College. Bassist James Stelfox and drummer Ben Byrne had been playing together in Warrington, Cheshire {{for a number of}} years. When their <b>regular</b> singer <b>fell</b> ill, they recruited young Chorley singer and songwriter James Walsh from a school choir. He was influenced by Jeff Buckley and his 1994 album Grace in his singing style. Comparing it to Oasis' (What's the Story) Morning Glory? album, which Walsh says sums up a unique moment, Grace captures every moment.|$|R
50|$|She {{was born}} in Lake Charles, Louisiana, the eldest {{daughter}} of the 15 children of Isaac and Suzie Lutcher. She was the sister of saxophonist Joe Lutcher. Her father was a bass player, and her mother a church organist. She received piano lessons, and her father formed a family band with Nellie playing piano. At age 12, she played with Ma Rainey, when Rainey's <b>regular</b> pianist <b>fell</b> ill {{and had to be}} left behind in the previous town. Searching for a temporary replacement in Lake Charles, one of the neighbors told her there was a little girl who played in church who {{might be able to do}} it.|$|R
25|$|In {{the drive}} to spread {{vocational}} and technical education, <b>regular</b> secondary-school enrollments <b>fell.</b> By 1986 universal secondary education {{was part of the}} nine-year compulsory education law that made primary education (six years) and junior-middle-school education (three years) mandatory. The desire to consolidate existing schools and {{to improve the quality of}} key middle schools was, however, under the education reform, more important than expanding enrollment.|$|R

25|$|The British {{tried to}} rally around the Western battery, but the battery's {{travelling}} magazine (a portable chest containing cartridges) exploded, apparently {{as the result of}} an accident.

Meanwhile, Chauncey's schooners, most of which carried a long 24-pounder or 32-pounder cannon, were bombarding the fort and Government House battery.
