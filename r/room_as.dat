5|$|The 1828 {{construction}} {{features a}} central hall with three {{rooms on the}} east and west sides of roughly symmetrical construction with chimneys at the intersection of the front and middle rooms. The first floor chimneys were flanked by doors allowing access to the other rooms and storage on the other side. The layout and usage of the jail is not known for certain, but it is believed that the rooms to the west were used by the jailer and his family. The first <b>room</b> <b>as</b> a parlor, the middle as the dining room and the rear <b>room</b> <b>as</b> the kitchen. As part of the renovations in 1959, the Society changed the parlor to a research room, the dining room into a library and added a door to the stairway from the kitchen. The front research room and library retain the original fireplaces, pine floorboards and closets, but the connecting passage between the two rooms were changed to a bathroom. The east side of the jail {{is believed to have been}} used by the jailer for his occupational duties, with the front <b>room</b> <b>as</b> a public reception room and the middle <b>room</b> <b>as</b> his office. The rear room in the back may have been used for record or other storage. After leasing the property, the Society removed the partitions in the rooms that separated the rooms from each other.|$|E

5|$|Bin Laden {{peered through}} his bedroom {{door at the}} Americans {{advancing}} up the stairs, and then retreated into the <b>room</b> <b>as</b> the lead SEAL fired a shot at him, which either missed or {{hit him in the}} side. Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden, rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E

5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, are contained {{in one or more}} rooms called organ chambers. Because sound does not project from a chamber into the <b>room</b> <b>as</b> clearly as from a freestanding organ case, enchambered organs may sound muffled and distant. For this reason, some modern builders, {{particularly those}} building instruments specializing in polyphony rather than Romantic compositions, avoid this unless the architecture of the room makes it necessary.|$|E

5|$|The keep {{was inside}} the inner bailey and {{contained}} the king's accommodation. It had two rooms: an antechamber and an audience room. While Allen Brown interpreted the audience <b>room</b> <b>as</b> the king's chamber, historian Liddiard believes it is probably a throne room. A throne room emphasises the political importance of the castle. In England there is nothing similar to Château Gaillard's keep, but there are buildings with a similar design in France in the 12th and 13th centuries.|$|E

5|$|William Moreton III used what {{is today}} {{known as the}} Exhibition <b>Room</b> <b>as</b> a bedroom in the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the {{adjoining}} Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition <b>Room</b> <b>as</b> a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style tempera painting, thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house, with a much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.|$|E

While there, Nunung writes a letter to her father that Joni kisses her goodnight every day. This news sparks Nenny's titillation and Toto's jealousy. Nana insists that Toto choose between her and Nunung; Toto decides to go to Bandung and protest Joni's impropriety. He confronts Nunung and confesses his love for her. She spitefully tells him that she sleeps in the same <b>room</b> <b>as</b> Joni every night.|$|E
5|$|After {{only six}} games in Milwaukee, McGrattan was traded {{back to the}} Flames, in {{exchange}} for Joe Piskula, on February 28, 2013. McGrattan's positive influence in the locker <b>room</b> <b>as</b> a player always prepared to play was cited as a reason why Calgary re-acquired him. The Flames also expected he would add a physical presence to the team, which he did in his re-debut with the Flames, a 4–2 victory over Vancouver that included several hits and a fight with Tom Sestito – his first NHL fight in over a year. He gave the crowd a salute following the fight, sending the fans into a frenzy and earning a ten-minute misconduct. He finished the season with three goals and 49 PIM in 19 games with the Flames, and earned a two-year contract extension from the team.|$|E
