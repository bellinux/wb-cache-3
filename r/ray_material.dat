50|$|Like all lunar maria, Oceanus Procellarum {{was formed}} by ancient basaltic flood {{volcanic}} eruptions that covered the region in a thick, nearly flat layer of solidified magma.

Around its edges lie many minor bays and seas, including Mare Nubium and Mare Humorum to the south. To the northeast, Oceanus Procellarum is separated from Mare Imbrium by the Carpathian Mountains. On its north-west edge lies the 32 km wide Aristarchus ray crater, which is considered as the brightest feature on the Near side of the Moon. Also, the more-prominent ray-crater Copernicus lies within the eastern edge of the mare, distinctly with its bright <b>ray</b> <b>materials</b> sprawling over the darker material.

Aim of the work: The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the possible protective effect of the chemical constituents of grape seed extract on oxidative stress induced by gamma <b>rays.</b> <b>Materials</b> & Methods: Rats were subjected to 8 Gy fractionated doses of gamma radiation, grape seed extract 100 mg/kg body weights were daily administrated before and within radiation exposure. All parameters were investigated at 1 st and 14 th days post last radiation exposure. Results: The results revealed that administration of grape seed extract to irradiated rats significantly ameliorates the changes induced in antioxidant system. TBARS (lipid peroxidation index) were significantly decreased when compared with their equivalent values in irradiated rats. In conclusion, the administration of grape seed extract to irradiated rats might provide substantial protection against oxidative damages due to its free radical scavenging and antioxidant properties of its ingredients. It could be suggested that, grape seed extract may have a potential benefits to people receiving radiotherap...|$|R
40|$|The National Ignition Facility (NIF) {{will consist}} of 192 laser beams that have a total energy of up to 1. 8 MJ in the 3 rd {{harmonic}} ({lambda} = 0. 35 {micro}m) {{with the amount of}} 2 nd harmonic and fundamental light depending on the pulse shape. Material near best focus of the 3 rd harmonic light will be vaporized/ablated very rapidly, with a significant fraction of the laser energy converted into plasma x rays. Additional plasma x rays can come from imploding/igniting capsule inside Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) hohlraums. Material from outer portions of the target, diagnostic components, first-wall material, and optical components, are ablated by the plasma x <b>rays.</b> <b>Material</b> out to a radius of order 3 cm from target center is also exposed to a significant flux of 2 nd harmonic and fundamental laser light. Ablation can accelerate the remaining material to high velocities if it has been fragmented or melted. In addition, the high velocity debris wind of the initially vaporized material pushes on the fragments/droplets and increases their velocity. The high velocity shrapnel fragments/droplets can damage the fused silica shields protecting the final optics in NIF. We discuss modeling efforts to calculate vaporization/ablation, x-ray generation, shrapnel production, and ways to mitigate damage to the shields...|$|R
50|$|Courtney {{is a tiny}} lunar {{impact crater}} on the Mare Imbrium, a lunar mare in the {{northwest}} quadrant of the Moon. It lies about two crater diameters to the northwest of Euler, in an otherwise isolated stretch of the mare. The dark surface in this region is marked by Euler's <b>ray</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
50|$|Within {{the outer}} rim, the {{interior}} floor has been flooded {{in the past}} by basaltic lava, leaving a relatively flattened surface that has a lower albedo than the surrounding terrain and so appears darker.

50|$|Exposure to free {{neutrons}} can be hazardous, {{since the}} interaction of neutrons with molecules in the body can cause disruption to molecules and atoms, and can also cause reactions {{that give rise to}} other forms of radiation (such as protons). The normal precautions of radiation protection apply: Avoid exposure, stay as far from the source as possible, and keep exposure time to a minimum. Some particular thought must be given to how to protect from neutron exposure, however. For other types of radiation, e.g., alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma <b>rays,</b> <b>material</b> of a high atomic number and with high density make for good shielding; frequently, lead is used. However, this approach will not work with neutrons, since the absorption of neutrons does not increase straightforwardly with atomic number, as it does with alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Instead one needs to look at the particular interactions neutrons have with matter (see the section on detection above). For example, hydrogen-rich materials are often used to shield against neutrons, since ordinary hydrogen both scatters and slows neutrons. This often means that simple concrete blocks or even paraffin-loaded plastic blocks afford better protection from neutrons than do far more dense materials. After slowing, neutrons may then be absorbed with an isotope that has high affinity for slow neutrons without causing secondary capture radiation, such as lithium-6.|$|R
