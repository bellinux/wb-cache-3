60|$|On one side, {{beginning}} at the very lip of the pool, was a tiny meadow, a cool, <b>resilient</b> <b>surface</b> of green that extended {{to the base of}} the frowning wall. Beyond the pool a gentle slope of earth ran up and up to meet the opposing wall. Fine grass covered the slope--grass that was spangled with flowers, with here and there patches of color, orange and purple and golden. Below, the canyon was shut in. There was no view. The walls leaned together abruptly and the canyon ended in a chaos of rocks, moss-covered and hidden by a green screen of vines and creepers and boughs of trees. Up the canyon rose far hills and peaks, the big foothills, pine-covered and remote. And far beyond, like clouds upon the border of the sky, towered minarets of white, where the Sierra's eternal snows flashed austerely the blazes of the sun.|$|E

60|$|London, {{under the}} Visible Smoke Law, by which any {{production}} of visible smoke {{with or without}} excuse was punishable by a fine, had already ceased to be the sombre smoke-darkened city of the Victorian time; it had been, and indeed was, constantly being rebuilt, and its main streets were already beginning to take on those characteristics that distinguished them throughout {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century. The insanitary horse and the plebeian bicycle had been banished from the roadway, which was now of a <b>resilient,</b> glass-like <b>surface,</b> spotlessly clean; and the foot passenger was restricted to a narrow vestige of the ancient footpath on either side of the track and forbidden at the risk of a fine, if he survived, to cross the roadway. People descended from their automobiles upon this pavement and went through the lower shops to the lifts and stairs to the new ways for pedestrians, the Rows, that ran along the front of the houses at the level of the first story, and, being joined by frequent bridges, gave the newer parts of London a curiously Venetian appearance. In some streets there were upper and even third-story Rows.

40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} is {{a highly}} hydrated fibre composite material that provides a <b>resilient,</b> low-friction bearing <b>surface</b> covering bones where they articulate. The literature suggests that the tissue becomes increasingly elastic, less viscoelastic, as the loading rate increases, i. e. that hysteresis, the energy lost between loading and unloading, will decrease with increasing strain-rate. Here we show, using a controlled impact, that hysteresis increases with strain rate. No fluid was lost during the deformation and {{the ratio of the}} radial to the axial strains, Poisson’s ratio, measured using high-speed video recording, increased as the tissue was deformed, starting close to zero and tending towards that for an isovolumetric deformation. The decreasing coefficient of restitution, a measure of the hysteresis, was modelled using a non-linear viscoelastic element, as a first approximation.

While some codes provide high noise thresholds suitable for robust quantum memories, others allow straightforward gate implementation needed for data processing.

40|$|Cartilage is a dense {{connective}} tissue which covers the opposing ends of bones in a joint and acts as lubricating and <b>resilient</b> <b>surface.</b> Cartilage consists of hydrated extracellular matrix and relatively few cells. The extracellular matrix is a network of collagen fibers and large proteoglycan aggregates. Proteoglycans have a net negative charge under physi-ological conditions known as fixed charge density (FCD). These negatively charged mole-cules preferentially attract positive sodium ions and thus {{are a source of}} osmotic pressure which gives cartilage its resilience to compression. These extracellular sodium cations can be measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and used as a nondestructive tech-nique to monitor the tissue glycosaminoglycan concentration. Arthritis is a degenerative disease of cartilage and is characterized by a decrease in proteoglycan concentration. Sodium MR imaging can be an early indicator of this degenerative process and may pro-vide non-invasive means of measuring cartilage degradation in vivo.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} adherence to selected recommended safety standards in North Carolina child care centers. METHODS: A self administered questionnaire eliciting information about safety practices in child care was mailed to a randomly selected sample of 409 North Carolina child care centers. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety five usable questionnaires were returned from child care centers in 75 counties. Results indicated that all of the standards included in the state's child regulations were being adhered to by at least 80 % of the centers. However, adherence to recommended standards not included in the state's regulations was quite variable, with one standard implemented by less than 5 % of the centers. The lowest rates of adherence were found for standards specifying that <b>resilient</b> <b>surface</b> material be used under playground equipment (4 %) and that certain foods that may present a choking hazard to small children not be served (27 %). CONCLUSIONS: Many hazards not addressed in North Carolina child care regulations are present in child care centers. Some safety standards are not adhered to due to lack of knowledge or limited resources. Inclusion of national standards in state child care regulations appears to reduce, but not eliminate, the likelihood of hazards being reported. Further research should include on-site inspections and attention to safety in family child care...|$|E

40|$|Surface {{sensitive}} synchrotron x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and real-time in situ XPS {{were used}} to study the thermal stability of the hydroxyl termination and downward band bending on the polar surfaces of ZnO single crystals. On the O-polar face, {{the position of the}} Fermi level could be reversibly cycled between the conduction band and the band gap over an energetic distance of approximately 0. 8 eV (similar to 1 / 4 of the band gap) by controlling the surface H coverage using simple ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) heat treatments up to 750 degrees C, dosing with H 2 O/H- 2 and atmospheric exposure. A metallic to semiconductorlike transition in the electronic nature of the O-polar face was observed at an H coverage of approximately 0. 9 monolayers. For H coverage less than this, semiconducting (depleted) O-polar surfaces were created that were reasonably stable in UHV conditions. In contrast, the downward band bending on the Zn-polar face was significantly more <b>resilient,</b> and depleted <b>surfaces</b> could not be prepared by heat treatment alone. preprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{interactions}} {{are critical for}} the successful use of mesoporous silica nanoparticles as delivery systems for antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In order to elucidate these, we here investigate effects of nanoparticle charge and porosity on AMP loading and release, as well as consequences of this for membrane interactions and antimicrobial effects. Anionic mesoporous silica particles were found to incorporate considerable amounts of the cationic AMP LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES (LL- 37), whereas loading is much lower for non-porous or positively charged silica nanoparticles. Due to preferential pore localization, anionic mesoporous particles, but not the other particles, protect LL- 37 from degradation by infection-related proteases. For anionic mesoporous nanoparticles, membrane disruption is mediated almost exclusively by peptide release. In contrast, non-porous silica particles build up a <b>resilient</b> LL- 37 <b>surface</b> coating due to their higher negative surface charge, and display largely particle-mediated membrane interactions and antimicrobial effects. For positively charged mesoporous silica nanoparticles, LL- 37 incorporation promotes the membrane binding and disruption displayed by the particles {{in the absence of}} peptide, but also causes toxicity against human erythrocytes. Thus, the use of mesoporous silica nanoparticles as AMP delivery systems requires consideration of membrane interactions and selectivity of both free peptide and the peptide-loaded nanoparticles, the latter critically dependent on nanoparticle properties...|$|R
40|$|Skin autografting {{was first}} {{described}} by Reverdin in 1871 [1]. The clinical utility of allograft skin {{as a method}} for wound coverage followed shortly thereafter [2]. Girdner [3] {{was the first to}} report the use of allogeneic skin to cover a burn wound; however, it wasn’t until 5 years later that Thiersch [4] described the histologic anatomy of skin engraftment and later popularized the clinical use of split-thickness skin grafts. In 1874, Thiersch [4] published a report about a small series of patients on whom he later used partial-thickness grafts. Following the report, extensive trials led to cutting the grafts extremely thin to leave some of the surface epithelium behind to heal the donor site. This practice necessitated the use of little, thin chips of grafts, known in the English medical literature as ‘‘Thiersch grafts,’ ’ ‘‘pinch grafts,’ ’ ‘‘epidermis grafts,’ ’ or ‘‘razor grafts’’; these grafts were so generally unsatisfactory for resurfacing large areas that their use was soon restricted to application to small refractory ulcers. Three developments in skin grafting brought about radical advances in the treatment of burn wounds. First, it became apparent that the dermal layer is {{the most important part of}} a skin graft in producing a new, tough, <b>resilient</b> <b>surface.</b> Second, it was demonstrated that the donor-site epithelium, after removal of a partial-thickness graft, regenerated from deep islands of hair follicle and sebaceous gland epithelium; thus, grafts could be cut thicker rather than as thin as possible, and the dermis could be transferred without interfering with the healing sites. Finally, because grafts could be cut much thicker, it became feasible to design instruments for cutting larger grafts. These thicker grafts were termed ‘‘split-thickness grafts,’ ’ and for the first Clin Lab Med 25 (2005) 587 – 605 time large areas could be resurfaced satisfactorily in terms of square feet rather than square centimeters. * Corresponding author...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{immediate}} effect of <b>resilient</b> splints through <b>surface</b> electromyography testing and to compare the findings with the electromyographic profiles of asymptomatic subjects. The participants were 30 subjects, 15 patients with TMD (TMD Group) and 15 healthy subjects (Control Group), classified according to Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD) Axis I. A resilient occlusal splint was made for each patient in the TMD Group from two mm thick silicon to cover all teeth. The EMG examination was performed before and immediately after installing the splint. Three tests were performed as follows: 1. Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) using cotton rolls (standards test); 2. MVC in maximal intercuspation position; and 3. MVC with the splint in position. The EMG signal was recorded for five seconds. EMG indices were calculated to assess muscle symmetry, jaw torque, and impact. There was a statistically significant difference when comparing the results among the study groups. The symmetry index values in the Control Group were higher than the TMD Initial Group and similar to the TMD Group after the installation of the splint. The index values of torque were higher in TMD Initial Group when compared with the Controls. Impact values were lower than normal values in the TMD Initial Group and restored upon installation of the splint.

40|$|While certain design {{practices}} tend to relegate materiality as {{a passive}} medium of {{form in the}} final stages of design, this thesis focuses on the implementation of material behaviour as an active parameter within both the process and the outcome of design. The work considers materials’ inherent dynamic properties as a means to build performative material compositions. As a practice-led research, this thesis involves digital fabrication processes and computational methods to design a kinetic surface system. The project is developed through applied research methods, which refer to the utilisation of prototyping and scientific experiments. The practical research is presented as three associated case studies that lead to the final production of kinetic structures. The first study examines the production of <b>resilient</b> tridimensional <b>surfaces</b> by combining stretch textiles with 3 D Printing technology. The second case consists of the generation of pneumatic muscles and their integration as actuators into the membranes. The third case study includes the design of assembly and control system of the final kinetic structures. The theoretical research provides the necessary background information regarding the materials, technologies and procedures employed throughout the scope of this thesis. Furthermore, it provides an in-depth reflection upon the questions raised by the practical research. It also examines the critical role of material behaviour within digital design processes. Literature and retrospective analysis of the processes are used as sources of information to support the discourse. Knowledge and expertise from different disciplines are necessary to achieve the objectives of this thesis. The project involves collaboration with Martin Genet, recently graduated student from the Digital Knowledge Department of Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Architecture Paris-Malaquais. Additionally, the practical research of the thesis is conducted within the premises of ADDLAB (Aalto University Digital Design Laboratory) facilities, as a multidisciplinary project between Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture, and School of Engineering. The project establishes an experimental strategy that encompasses design, material development and digital fabrication in a holistic research approach. Additionally, the thesis concludes by mapping the importance of understanding and including material information within design processes, while presenting the significant potentials of digital tools in material development. The final outcome of this thesis is presented through an exhibition of the process prototypes and the final kinetic structures...|$|R

The UHI effect is commonly present in cities due to increased urbanization, where anthropogenic heat and human modifications have altered the characteristics of surfaces and atmosphere. Urban structure, land cover and metabolism are underlined as UHI key contributors and can result in higher urban densities being up to 10 °C hotter compared to their peri-urban surroundings.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} new hydrogen- and polarity-related {{effects in}} the photoluminescence of ZnO single crystal wafers {{and the relationship between}} surface electron accumulation and surface hydroxyl coverage on different ZnO surfaces. A comparative study of the low temperature photoluminescence of various types of hydrothermal and melt-grown ZnO wafers revealed several new hydrogen-related exciton recombination lines and a number of consistent polarity-related differences in the PL emission from different crystallographic surfaces. Temperature-dependent PL measurements were extensively used to distinguish the ground and excited state transitions involved in these effects. ZnO samples of different surface polarity were annealed in oxygen and nitrogen gases and in hydrogen-containing forming gas mixtures in an attempt to identify the origin of these new PL features. The well known aluminium-related I_₆ recombination line was resolved into two separate features in hydrothermal ZnO, and the new component I 6 -H (3. 36081 eV) was found to repeatedly quench and then re-emerge after annealing in oxygen and forming gas, respectively. A model involving an aluminium - lithium - hydrogen defect complex was proposed for I 6 -H and further tested via hydrogen and deuterium implantation experiments on hydrothermal ZnO wafers with different lithium concentrations. These experiments also provided evidence for the involvement of a different lithium-hydrogen defect complex in other hydrogen-related emission lines I₄b,c (3. 36219 eV and 3. 36237 eV) unique to hydrothermal ZnO. In addition, a broad Gaussian-shaped feature observed in the near-band-edge PL emission from the O-polar (000 ‾ 1), a-plane (11 ‾ 20) and r-plane (1 ‾ 102) faces of ZnO was shown to be surface sensitive and also related to hydrogen. The involvement of hydrogen in the chemical and electronic properties of different ZnO surfaces was also investigated. The thermal stability of the hydroxyl termination and the associated downward surface band bending on the polar and non-polar surfaces of ZnO was studied by synchrotron and real-time photoelectron spectroscopy, both during and after annealing and subsequent H₂O/H₂ dosing in ultra-high vacuum conditions. On the O-polar face, the band bending could be reversibly switched over a range of approximately 0. 8 eV by adjusting the surface H-coverage using simple UHV heat treatments and atmospheric exposure. A transition from electron accumulation to electron depletion on the O-polar face was observed at a H-coverage of approximately 0. 9 monolayers. In contrast, the downward band bending on the Zn-polar face was signiﬁcantly more <b>resilient</b> and electron-depleted <b>surfaces</b> could not be prepared by heat treatment alone. This was also the case for in situ cleaving in UHV conditions which failed to produce hydroxyl-free surfaces due to migration of hydrogen from the bulk to the cleaved surface. Interestingly, the thermal stability of the hydroxyl termination on the a-plane (11 ‾ 20) and m-plane (10 ‾ 10) surfaces was signiifcantly lower than on the polar faces due to the availability of a lower energy desorption pathway and the electrostatic stability of these non-polar surfaces in their clean, bulk terminated form. The surface band bending on the non-polar ZnO surfaces was also found to be directly related to their OH coverage with a transition from downward to upward band bending, similar to that observed on the O-polar face, as the OH coverage was reduced. Thermal admittance spectroscopy and deep level transient spectroscopy was used to investigate the effect of lithium removal on the defect nature of hydrothermal ZnO. A number of new defects were introduced by the high temperature (1100 - 1400 °C) annealing/re-polishing process used to reduce the lithium concentration, particularly E₁₉₀ (also known as T 2) which is thought to be related to Zn vacancies. Significantly, both the E₅₀ defect level and the I 6 -H PL emission line were absent after lithium (and hydrogen) removal suggesting an association of both these features with the same aluminium - lithium - hydrogen defect complex...|$|R
