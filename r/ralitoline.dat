40|$|<b>Ralitoline</b> and CI- 953 are {{anticonvulsant}} compounds {{active in}} both maximal electroshock and kindling models of seizures with rodents. CI- 953 (IC 50 = 5 [mu]M) and <b>ralitoline</b> (IC 50 = 2 [mu]M) both blocked sustained repetitive firing of sodium action potentials with effects on firing activity triggered by spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials at higher concentrations. No effects on iontophoretic GABA and glutamate responses were noted. Both compounds inhibited the binding of tritiated batrachotoxinin A 20 -[alpha]-benzoate ([3 H]BTX-b) to rat brain synaptosomes with apparent Kd values of 29 [mu]M (CI- 953) and 25 [mu]M (<b>ralitoline).</b> Our {{results suggest that}} effects on voltage-dependent sodium channels may underlie the anticonvulsant action of these compounds...|$|E
