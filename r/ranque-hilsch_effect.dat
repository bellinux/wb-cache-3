40|$|The {{vortex tube}} or Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube is {{a device that}} enables the {{separation}} of hot and cold air as compressed air flows tangentially into the vortex chamber through inlet nozzles. Separating cold and hot airs by using {{the principles of the}} vortex tube can be applied to industrial applications such as cooling equipment in CNC machines, refrigerators, cooling suits, heating processes, etc. The vortex tube is well-suited for these applications because it is simple, compact, light, quiet, and does not use Freon or other refrigerants (CFCs/HCFCs). It has no moving parts and does not break or wear and therefore requires little maintenance. Thus, this paper presents an overview of the phenomena occurring inside the vortex tube during the temperature/energy separation on both the counter flow and parallel flow types. The paper also reviews the experiments and the calculations presented in previous studies on temperature separation in the vortex tube. The experiment consisted of two important parameters, the first is the geometrical characteristics of the vortex tube (for example, the diameter and length of the hot and cold tubes, the diameter of the cold orifice, shape of the hot (divergent) tube, number of inlet nozzles, shape of the inlet nozzles, and shape of the cone valve. The second is focused on the thermo-physical parameters such as inlet gas pressure, cold mass fraction, moisture of inlet gas, and type of gas (air, oxygen, helium, and methane). For each parameter, the temperature separation mechanism and the flow-field inside the vortex tubes is explored by measuring the pressure, velocity, and temperature fields. The computation review is concentrated on the quantitative, theoretical, analytical, and numerical (finite volume method) aspects of the study. Although many experimental and numerical studies on the vortex tubes have been made, the physical behaviour of the flow is not fully understood due to its complexity and the lack of consistency in the experimental findings. Furthermore, several different hypotheses based on experimental, analytical, and numerical studies have been put forward to describe the thermal separation phenomenon.

40|$|The present paper reports an {{investigation}} of a double-circuit Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube using a fully three-dimensional numerical model of the turbulent compressible air flow. The main purpose of the paper is to perform {{a detailed analysis of}} the thermal and flow patterns obtained with RSM-LRR and LES turbulence models in order to understand which one is able to represent the <b>Ranque-Hilsch</b> energy separation <b>effect</b> observed in a double-circuit vortex tube in the most effective way. The LES turbulence model is found to represent the qualitative turbulence of the flow better than the RSM-LRR model. The detailed analysis of turbulence characteristics estimated by LES model indicates that turbulence has {{a significant impact on the}} energy separation phenomenon. Both LES and RSM-LRR turbulence models are shown to have a weak accuracy in the prediction of the integral characteristics of a double-circuit vortex tube. An attempt was made to improve the results achieved with LES turbulence model by means of a grid refinement and an increase of Smagorinsky constant value, but they were found to have a limited impact. This leads to the conclusion that more advanced kinds of LES turbulence model should be investigated in order to increase the accuracy of the simulation of a double-circuit vortex tube...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of temperature distribution in confined steady rotating gas flows is called <b>Ranque-Hilsch</b> <b>effect.</b> The simple counter-flow vortex tube {{consists of a}} long hollow cylinder with tangential nozzle at one end for injecting compressed air. Rotating air escapes the tube through two different outlets: a central orifice diaphragm placed near the inlet where the cold portion of air escapes from and a ring–shaped peripheral outlet {{at the opposite end}} of the tube where the hot air leaves the tube. This paper focuses on the performance of the Ranque–Hilsch vortex tube. The flow inside the vortex tube can be described as rotating air, which moves as a spring-shaped vortex track. The peripheral flow moves toward the hot end and the axial flow moves in the opposite direction toward the cold end. The angle between the circular helix and the vertical axis is an important parameter, since it decides the length of the vortex track and peripheral velocity of the flow, which influence the efficiency of the vortex tube. The angle can be called “Ranque angle ” or “vortex angle”. Various structures were placed in the vortex chamber of a specially designed tube to generate different vortex angles. A series of experiments have been done in order to find the relationship between the vortex angle and the performance of the vortex tube...|$|E
