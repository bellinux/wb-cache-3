25|$|The Cleveland Wire Mill Company, {{established}} in February 1867. Its works were built {{adjacent to the}} neighborhood's western border where Wire Avenue met the Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad tracks. The only mill {{of its kind in}} northern Ohio when it was built, it proved so successful that it doubled in size within a year. This mill was also the largest {{of its kind in the}} country, and capable of manufacturing an extremely wide range of product. Cleveland Rolling Mill purchased the works of the Cleveland Wire Mill Company in 1868 or 1869. Cleveland Rolling Mill expanded the plant beginning in 1896, adding a <b>rod</b> <b>mill</b> with two small blast furnaces and a continuous <b>rod</b> <b>mill</b> with one small blast furnace.|$|E

Construction of the Central Furnaces enabled the company to dismantle two of the older furnaces at Newburgh in 1884. Another blooming mill was erected at Newburgh in 1901, another blast furnace in 1901, and a <b>rod</b> <b>mill</b> in 1902.|$|E

50|$|The IsaMill is a stirred-medium {{grinding}} mill, {{in which}} the grinding medium and the ore being ground are stirred rather than being subjected to the tumbling action of older high-throughput mills (such as ball <b>mills</b> and <b>rod</b> <b>mills).</b> Stirred mills often consist of stirrers mounted on a rotating shaft located along the central axis of the mill. The mixing chamber {{is filled with the}} grinding medium (normally sand, smelter slag, or ceramic or steel beads) and a suspension of water and ore particles, referred to in the minerals industry as a slurry. In contrast, ball <b>mills,</b> <b>rod</b> <b>mills</b> and other tumbling mills are only partially filled by the grinding medium and the ore.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that slender rod {{machining}} operation is a very difficult problem due to its low stiffness. During slender rod machining process, the deflection, vibration, cutting heat and cutting force of the machined part are the main reasons affecting the product quality. Based on the analysis of current research status of slender <b>rod</b> <b>milling</b> technology, process scheme, milling strategy, clamping fixture and tool designing is carried out in this work. In a roughing milling stage, we create a new strategy of square <b>rod</b> <b>milling,</b> called “equilateral milling strategy ” to eliminating deflection. In finish-milling top waveform stage, a way using semicircle profile cutter to finish was applied. Complex interpolated movement is transform into simple two-dimension curved movement to shorten machine time and increase of efficiency in the way. In addition, machined surface with burnishing effect, high precision and high surface quality is obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of feed size and pulp density {{on the specific}} rate of breakage of quartz was investigated. Plots of log fraction of feed remaining within the feed size interval against grinding time allowed {{the application of the}} first order grinding model to be examined. Substantial non-linearities were observed for all feed sizes due to environmental and material factors. For feed sizes above 1. 3 mm, the specific rate of quartz breakage was higher with <b>rod</b> <b>milling</b> than ball milling, but below this size the reverse was true. Material that remained in the feed size interval after the initial grinding broke more slowly in subsequent grinding than the original feed material. Grinding media and time as well as feed size influenced the effects of pulp density on grinding. More dilute pulps (eg 50 per cent solids density by weight) were favoured for higher rates of breakage in <b>rod</b> <b>milling</b> but for ball milling, the optimum pulp density appeared to be 60 to 70 per cent solids by weight.

50|$|The plant’s output changed qualitatively. In 1968-70, {{the plant}} {{switched}} to {{production of the}} 6001-6008 series ball and <b>rod</b> <b>mills.</b> Thanks {{to the use of}} elastic couplings instead of gear couplings, and the application of self-aligning spherical bearings in roller mills, the durability of these assemblies increased 1.5 to 2 times. To reduce the noise the mills produced, steel linings were replaced with rubber linings. The lining procedure for the mill body became much less laborious.|$|R

40|$|Regrinding is an {{essential}} step in many mineral processing flowsheets as a final preparatory step for mineral separation. It is normally carried out in open-circuit ball <b>mills</b> or <b>rod</b> <b>mills.</b> Wide fluctuations occurring in the hardness and size distribution of feed materials to regrinding mills result in a nonuniform product fineness and processing inefficiency. Using a previously developed regrinding model, this paper presents the dynamic analysis and design considerations of a control system for open-circuit grinding, using the traditional P-, PI-, and PID-control algorithms.

5000|$|Comminution is {{particle}} size reduction of materials. Comminution may be carried out on either dry materials or slurries. Crushing and grinding are the two primary comminution processes. Crushing is normally carried out on [...] "run-of-mine" [...] ore, while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material. In comminution, the size reduction of particles is done by three types of forces: compression, impact and attrition. Compression and impact forces are extensively used in crushing operations while attrition is the dominant force in grinding. The primarily used equipment in crushing are-jaw crushers, gyratory crushers and cone crushers whereas <b>rod</b> <b>mills</b> and ball mills, closed circuited with a classifier unit, are generally employed for grinding purposes in a mineral processing plant. Crushing is a dry process whereas grinding is generally performed wet and hence is more energy intensive.|$|R
