The Mamluk army, {{with the support of}} forces loyal to Zaydi Imam Al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din, conquered the entire realm of the Tahiride, but failed to capture Aden in 1517. The Mamluk victory was short-lived. The Ottoman Empire conquered Egypt, hanging the last Mamluk Sultan in Cairo. The Ottomans had not decided to conquer Yemen until 1538. The Zaydi {{highland}} tribes emerged as national heroes by offering a stiff, vigorous resistance to the Turkish occupation.|$|E

25|$|After the Second World War, the {{railroad}} industry's downturn and dwindling profits caused the PRR to stop subsidizing the LIRR, and the LIRR went into receivership in 1949. The State of New York, <b>realizing</b> <b>how</b> important {{the railroad}} was to Long Island's future, began {{to subsidize the}} railroad in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1966, New York State bought the railroad's controlling stock from the PRR and put it under the newly formed Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (renamed Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968). With MTA subsidies the LIRR modernized further, continuing to be the busiest commuter railroad in the United States.|$|E

Holden began a business making hoops and poles, striking a contract up with a Seattle firm. The Judsons sold their property, keeping only two acres on the Squahalish Plateau to build a frame house. <b>Realizing</b> <b>how</b> flat the area was, they directed emigrants to build the city of Lynden on the plateau. The Judsons reserved two plots in Lynden: Judson organized {{the construction of the}} Northwest Normal School (which, through the efforts of George Judson, became a state institution, eventually moving to Bellingham as Western Washington University); and Holden the Judson Opera House. On March 16, 1891, the city of Lynden was officially incorporated. Holden Judson was elected its first mayor.|$|E

25|$|Mantle {{spoke with}} great remorse of his {{drinking}} in a 1994 Sports Illustrated cover story. He {{said that he}} was telling the same old stories, and <b>realizing</b> <b>how</b> many of them involved himself and others being drunk – including at least one drunk-driving accident – he decided they were not funny anymore. He admitted he had often been cruel and hurtful to family, friends, and fans because of his alcoholism, and sought to make amends. Mantle became a Christian because of his former teammate Bobby Richardson, an ordained Baptist minister who shared his faith with him. After the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, Mantle joined with fellow Oklahoman and Yankee Bobby Murcer {{to raise money for the}} victims.|$|E
25|$|The events {{behind their}} betrothal began after John William was almost killed by cannon fire and roundshot on two {{different}} occasions. His mother, Henriette Amalia, perhaps <b>realizing</b> <b>how</b> vulnerable her son was, quickly began looking for a suitable bride to ensure an heir. In the end, the choice came down to two German princesses. She apparently informed him that he should think of the choice as between two chairs, {{and that he should}} choose the most comfortable of the two. John duly traveled to Hesse-Kassel and became engaged to the 20-year-old Marie Louise within a week. He did not even bother meeting the other candidate. The main factor in this decision was probably that Marie Louise's father was a trusted general under the well-respected Duke of Marlborough. In addition, marriage to a daughter of the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel would also have served to strengthen John William's place among the other ruling houses.|$|E
25|$|After <b>realizing</b> <b>how</b> many Greek and Roman myths he {{had left}} {{untouched}} as well the immense success of the original series, Riordan began writing a second series, using inspiration for his storyline from experiences {{that he and his}} children had while playing video and role-playing games such as World of Warcraft and Scion. After creating the storyline, Riordan created three new main characters—Jason, Piper, and Leo—but continued to use the previous main characters such as Annabeth and Grover as secondary characters. Unlike the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series which uses first-person narration solely from Percy's point of view, the second series is told in third-person, with the point of view alternating between various main characters. In The Lost Hero, those characters are Jason, Piper, and Leo. Although initially uncertain how fans would react, Riordan later found that they enjoyed the new format, as it allowed them to learn more about each character.|$|E

25|$|Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, – This was {{recognized}} as a critical case even before it reached the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Earl Warren, <b>realizing</b> <b>how</b> controversial the case {{would be for the}} public, very much wanted to avoid any dissents in the case. But Reed was the lone hold-out. Other members of the Supreme Court worried about Reed's commitment to civil rights, as {{he was a member of}} the (then) all-white Burning Tree Club in Washington, D.C., and his Kentucky home had an all-white restrictive covenant (a covenant which had led Reed to recuse himself from a civil rights case in 1948). Yet, Reed had written the majority decision in Smith v. Allwright and joined the majority in Sweatt v. Painter, , which barred separate but equal racial segregation in law schools. Reed originally planned to write a dissent in Brown, but joined the majority before a decision was issued. Many observers, including Chief Justice Warren, believed a unanimous decision in Brown was necessary to win public acceptance for the decision. Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.|$|E
25|$|Season eight {{addresses}} Roseanne's baby {{shower and}} the subsequent arrival of her son, Jerry Garcia Conner. (In a continuity error, the baby had been revealed {{to be a girl}} in season seven. Roseanne, in an after-credits out of character scene, explains that after she fell pregnant she wished the Conners' baby to be the same gender as hers). The season starts when Dan decides to leave the security of his city job to help build the new prison being constructed outside of Lanford. With the pension, final check, and retirement money he receives for leaving his job he decides to give his family the vacation they never had and takes everyone, including Mark, David, and Roseanne's mother, along to Walt Disney World. It is later revealed that one of the nights the clan was at Disney was also the night Darlene got pregnant. Darlene quickly decides she and David want to have the baby and the two get engaged. The season climaxes with a very rushed wedding for Darlene. Immediately after the ceremony, <b>realizing</b> <b>how</b> much has been changing, Dan suffers a heart attack. In the next episode it is revealed that he survives, as DJ saved his life. The season concludes with Dan and Roseanne having a bitter fight after Dan refuses to stick to his diet and exercise plan, rehashing many of the buried personality clashes of the entire series. They end up wrecking their living room in the process. The credits fade as Roseanne walks out on Dan. Other subjects are DJ's Thanksgiving pageant, Darlene's wedding, and Dan's heart attack.|$|E
