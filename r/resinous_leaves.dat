"After {{proceeding}} {{four hours}} across the savannahs, we {{entered into a}} little wood composed of shrubs and small trees, which is called El Pejual; no doubt because of the great abundance of the 'Pejoa' (Gaultheria odorata,) a plant with very odoriferous leaves. The steepness of the mountain became less considerable, and we felt an indescribable pleasure in examining the plants of this region. Nowhere, perhaps, can be found collected together in so small a space of ground, productions so beautiful, and so remarkable {{in regard to the}} geography of plants. At the height of a thousand toises, the lofty savannahs of the hills terminate in a zone of shrubs, which by their appearance, their tortuous branches, their stiff leaves, and the dimensions and beauty of their purple flowers, remind us of what is called in the Cordilleras of the Andes the vegetation of the paramos[63] and the punas. We find there the {215} family of the Alpine rhododendrons, the thibaudias, the andromedas, the vacciniums, and those befarias[64] with <b>resinous</b> <b>leaves,</b> which we have several times compared to the rhododendron of our European Alps.|$|E

Between the early and middle Holocene, 11000 and 5000 cal years BP, Q. vacciniifolia were an extensive shrub in the Klamath Mountains (at the northern portions of California), which had ultramafic soils. At this period, Q. vacciniifolia was a main fire developer due to its abundance, mid-height and <b>resinous</b> <b>leaves.</b> Today, Q. vacciniifolia rarely forms dense chaparral-like stands, allowing fire resistant species to grow intermittently.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} {{vegetation}} from the Geography perspective {{focuses on the}} analysis of the spatial distribution and on the factors affecting it. One of these factors is the climate, which determines the characteristics of the vegetation and, on a larger scale, of the communities. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the climate-vegetation relationship by studying adaptations of the jarillal community regarding the semiarid climate in the Lihué Calel National Park, Argentina. Therefore, this contribution is concerned with the knowledge of the characteristics of the environment in order to understand how vegetation responds to certain phenomena, so management of protected areas will be more suitable. Lihué Calel National Park is a national protected area located in the south-center of La Pampa province, Argentina. According to Cabrera (1976) the area belongs to the floristic province of “monte” and the climate is warm and dry. In the interest to achieve the goals of this paper, Thornthwaite and Mather´s water balance was done. The data was collected from a weather station that belongs to the national park, for the period 1995 - 2010. Emberger›s pluviothermic coefficient, Lang´s rainfall index, De Martonne´s aridity index and Currey´s continentality index were analyzed. In addition, ten stands or plots of vegetation were placed to determine the floristic composition and the vegetation physiognomy. Then, plants species were identified as individuals and their adaptive responses were also analyzed. In conclusion, the survey verified that semi-arid climate conditions determine the morphology and the appearance of jarillal. Climate analysis shows that for the period 1995 - 2010 the average annual temperature is 16. 2 ° C and reveals that thermal summers and winters are well differentiated. Large water deficit is defined, because water balance indicates that the evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation during every month of the year. According to Thornthwaite’s criteria, the area is a semiarid climate type. With the analysis of other bioclimatic indices, more information is obtained: Lang´s index value is 25. 7 (arid), Emberger’s index is 41. 8 (semiarid), De Martonne’s index is 15. 9 (that refers to a semi-arid climate) and, at last, Currey’s index certified the existence of a continental climate because the result was 1. 16. Vegetation was surveyed and the result was quite interesting: 1 508 individuals that belong to 33 species. The percentage is: shrubs 57. 6 %, grasses 36. 4 % and trees 6. 1 %. Most of them were evergreen and only some deciduous. The distribution of vegetation in Lihué Calel responds to the semi-arid conditions. Some adaptations were observed like the development of the deep root system with an horizontal pattern in order to absorb the water from the soil, the loss of leafs in the unfavorable season, the replacement of leaves by thorns, small <b>resinous</b> <b>leaves,</b> leaf tilting and extensive roots, among others. The dominant plant of the jarillal is Larrea divaricate and it is considered as a xerofite plant. The process indicates that when stomata are open, transpiration rates increase; when they are closed, transpiration rates decrease. The Cactaceae family is represented by two species: Opuntia puelchana and Cereus aethiop. They are considered succulent plants that keep humidity inside. During rainy periods they absorb large amounts of water that they then use during the dry periods. These types of studies are relevant to understand how plants adapt to different environmental events, whether they are natural and/or anthropogenic. As a reference, in 2003, major fires occurred inside the National Park and they affected 7 000 hectares. The <b>resinous</b> <b>leaves</b> of the jarilla helped to propagate the fire all around the place. The next phase of the investigation process will be related to the physiological and morphological properties, through chemical analysis, so the adaptation of vegetation can be tested. With these new studies, the final purpose will be reached: good practice for plant conservation...|$|E
40|$|Cistus creticus ssp creticus is an {{indigenous}} shrub of the Mediterranean basin. Its <b>resinous</b> <b>leaves</b> contain glandular trichomes that excrete the characteristic resin, rich in labdane-type diterpenes with antibacterial and inhibitory activity against growth of leukemian cell cultures in vitro. Chemical analysis of trichomes isolated from leaves of different developmental stages revealed that labdane-type diterpenes accumulate and are excreted in higher concentrations in young leaves. A young-leaf enriched trichome-specific cDNA library was constructed and 2022 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were subsequently isolated, sequenced and annotated. Secondary metabolism in C. creticus ssp creticus trichomes {{was represented by}} 4 % of total transcripts mainly involved in flavonoid and terpenoid metabolism, among them five cDNA clones with significant homologies to terpene synthases genes. Heterologous expression and functional characterization of these cDNAs confirmed that they encode for terpene synthases, which catalyzed the production of multiple products. One of the enzymes {{was found to be}} bifunctional and catalyzed in the first step the convertion of geranyl-geraniol diphosphate into labd- 13 -en- 8 a- 15 -diol diphosphate and in the second step the production of manoyl oxides and one more labdane type diterpene present in Cistus creticus ssp. creticus resin giving new insights in the biosynthetic pathway leading to this category of terpenes. The other enzymes corresponded to sesquiterpene synthases and were named after their major product as β-caryophyllene synthase, β-farnesene synthase, germacrene B synthase and E-nerolidol synthase. Remarkably, a significant proportion of the ESTs (38 %) displayed no significant similarity to any other DNA or protein sequence of known function in existing databases, indicating a yet unknown function. These clones are putative candidates of novel genes exclusively or preferentially expressed in trichomes. With regard to the latter, RT-PCR analysis confirmed the preferential expression of 8 genes in trichomes. Initial identification of such trichome-specific genes was done through the application of microarray analysis via another project in lab. Within these genes was the germacrene B synthase gene mentioned earlier. Thus, this study revealed, for the first time, a trichome - specific expression for a sesquiterpene synthase gene. ...|$|E

El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar la relación clima-vegetación mediante el estudio de las adaptaciones de la comunidad del jarillal con respecto al clima semiárido en el Parque Nacional Lihué Calel, Argentina. Para ello se realiza el balance hídrico de Thornthwaite y Mather utilizando datos de la estación meteorológica del parque pertenecientes al periodo 1995 - 2010. Se aplican índices bioclimáticos y se realizan estands para conocer la composición florística y fisonomía de la vegetación. Se analizan las respuestas adaptativas identificadas en los individuos vegetales relevados y se comprueba que el clima semiárido condiciona la morfología y fisonomía del parque. Se demuestra la presencia de vegetación xerófila con predominio de arbustos y de cobertura abierta. Entre las adaptaciones observadas se distinguen la pérdida de hojas en la estación desfavorable, el reemplazo de hojas por espinas, hojas pequeñas y resinosas, inclinación de la hoja y raíces extensas.

The <b>leaves</b> are 15-25 cm long, pinnate with 13-21 leaflets 3-6 cm long and 1 cm broad, with a bluntly acute apex, and a serrated margin on the outer half or two thirds of the leaflet. The flowers are 13-18 mm diameter, with five white petals and 20 creamy-white stamens; they are produced in corymbs 10-14 cm diameter in late spring, and are hermaphrodite and insect pollinated. The fruit is a pome 2-3 cm long, greenish-brown, often tinged red on the side exposed to sunlight; it can be either apple-shaped (f. pomifera (Hayne) Rehder) or pear-shaped (f. pyrifera (Hayne) Rehder).|$|R
5000|$|Three {{varieties}} are recognised, the nominate Betula pubescens var. pubescens, B. p. var. litwinowii (distributed in the Caucasus and Turkey) and B. p. var. pumila (arctic downy birch or mountain birch, formerly called B. p. subsp. tortuosa). The latter has arisen from the hybridization of var. pubescens and B. nana (dwarf birch) and is characterised by its shrubby habit, smaller <b>leaves,</b> <b>resinous</b> glands {{and the smaller}} wings on the fruit. A number of cultivars have been grown but many {{are no longer in}} cultivation. They include [...] "Armenian gold", [...] "Arnold Brembo" [...] (scented foliage), crenata nana (shrubby and dwarf), incisa (lobed foliage), integrifolia (unlobed foliage), murigthii (shrubby with doubly serrate leaves), ponitica (hairless), undulata (leaf margins waxy), urticifolia (nettle-leaved), variegata (variegated) and [...] "Yellow wings". Two others, described by the German botanist Ernst Schelle in 1903, are also lost; pendula, a cultivar with a leader and weeping branches, and pendula nana, which grows into an umbrella-shaped tree with weeping branches but no leader.|$|R
5000|$|They are {{medium-sized}} {{to large}} evergreen trees, ranging from 10 - 60 m tall, with a conical to irregular crown, the latter occurring especially {{in some of}} the Asian species. The leading shoots generally droop. The bark is scaly and commonly deeply furrowed, with the colour ranging from grey to brown. The branches stem horizontally from the trunk and are usually arranged in flattened sprays that bend downward towards their tips. Short spur shoots, which are present in many gymnosperms, are weakly to moderately developed. The young twigs, as well as the distal portions of stem, are flexible and often pendent. The stems are rough due to pulvini that persist after the leaves fall. The winter buds are ovoid or globose, usually rounded at the apex and not <b>resinous.</b> The <b>leaves</b> are flattened to slightly angular and range from 5-35 mm long and 1-3 mm broad. They are borne singly and are arranged spirally on the stem; the leaf bases are twisted so the leaves lie flat either side of the stem or more rarely radially. Towards the base, the leaves narrow abruptly to a petiole set on a forward-angled pulvinus. The petiole is twisted at the base so it is almost parallel with the stem. The leaf apex is either notched, rounded, or acute. The undersides have two white stomatal bands (in T. mertensiana they are inconspicuous) separated by an elevated midvein. The upper surface of the leaves lack stomata, except in T. mertensiana. They have one resin canal that is present beneath the single vascular bundle.|$|R
