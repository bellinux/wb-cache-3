It offers a two-week educational program four times a year, teaching a comprehensive approach to diabetes care. Evaluation research found that centers that had implemented the approach taught at the CME course had excellent <b>staff</b> <b>rapport</b> and produced patients who were more knowledgeable about their disease and better able to engage in self-care. As {{a result of this}} research, the Stockholm DETU has added innovative field- interactive strategies to stimulate centers that have not implemented the program.

40|$|The AGM {{gives us}} an {{opportunity}} to reflect and report on the past year and to look to the future. The reports produced in the 1996 annual report are a formal record of the achievement, the dedication and the contribution to service by members of the staff. Finances, buildings, organisational structures and processes are necessary, but they are not sufficient to ensure the delivery of the care and excellence which are synonymous with the hospital. It is the people, whether medical, nursing, technical, administrative, secretarial or support, who convey and live that commitment and those values. I wish, therefore, to convey the deep appreciation of the Board and myself to everyone associated with this hospital. We are fortunate to have such a dedicated team of people devoted to the welfare of persons with disabilities. Outsiders are continually surprised at the great <b>rapport</b> between <b>staff</b> and patients in this hospital. It is something which distinguishes our service from that of other hospitals. At Board level our commitment is to support and facilitate the work of this team. notwithstanding the inevitable constraints imposed by limited public finances...|$|R
40|$|Background Research {{interest}} in exploring {{the quality of}} relationships 'rapport' between people with an intellectual disability (ID) and those that support them is slowly expanding. People with ID, particularly those that present a challenge to others, {{are more likely to}} experience abuse; consequently they {{have been the subject of}} many service scandals. People with little or no verbal language are likely to struggle to tell others that relationships with staff or family carers have deteriorated to the point of becoming abusive. The limited research available indicates that <b>rapport</b> with <b>staff</b> is associated with reductions in behaviour described as challenging, particularly when the behaviour serves a demand avoidance function. Despite some suggestions of how people with ID and limited language, may show that the relationship with carers is of a good quality there was no observational method of obtaining this information. Method A systematic review was conducted and literature used to design an observational method of rapport measurement, the IRM. Participants with ID were filmed in the presence of SP. Alongside the filmed observations staff completed the Staff Rating of Other Staff, Staff Self- Rating of Rapport and took part in Preference Testing Sessions (McLaughlin and Carr, 2005). Filmed material was analysed using the IRM. The IRM was subsequently developed into the easier to use Rapport Rating Scale (RRS). The RRS and measures used in the original IRM study were piloted by clinicians and reviewed in focus groups over an 8 month period. Results Literature searches found that there is very little research that has directly examined rapport between people with intellectual disabilities and staff or unpaid carers. Consequently concepts similar to rapport were examined and identified some material useful to the development of the IRM. Most concepts asserted that it is possible to see observable changes in participants with ID when <b>rapport</b> with <b>staff</b> or unpaid carers is developed. The IRM study showed, higher average IRM scores for the SP in the good rapport groups when compared to each of the McLaughlin and Carr (2005) measures. Analysis of the easier to use RRS indicated that professionals and trainees, were able to use the RRS to discriminate between good, neutral or poor rapport towards carers Conclusions Using rapport measures in clinical practice, suggests that clinicians supporting people with ID were able to use rapport measurement tools successfully. For a number of clinicians the content of the Positive Behaviour Support plan was altered or enhanced through the rapport information collected during assessment. There are implications of understanding and the ability to measure rapport between people with ID and staff, on, clinical practice, staff training, service development and the wider policy agenda...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Child Sex Trafficking By Brittnay Nail Worldwide, the sex {{industry}} is the second-largest, and the fastest-growing type of organized crime. Shockingly, 5. 5 million of the estimated 20. 9 million victims of human trafficking worldwide are minors. For this research project, data were collected through synthesis of 45 studies, 26 of which looked at risk factors that lead children into the sex trafficking industry. There were seven variables across the studies that were important predictors of a child being sex trafficked: childhood sexual abuse, other forms of child maltreatment, drug use or abuse, family dysfunction, low socio-economic status, running away, and poor education or lack of education. The remaining 19 studies reviewed were program evaluations describing services provided to sex trafficked youth across various programs. There were eight services/interventions that were {{the most widely used}} and most effective across programs: psychological counseling services, life skills development services, positive self-esteem activities, social services (case management, assessments, referrals, and evaluations), mental health services, youth education services, effective service delivery (multi-agency collaboration and awareness of sex trafficking and/or exploited youth), and a positive relationship or <b>rapport</b> between <b>staff</b> members and survivors. Findings support the conclusion that sex trafficked youth require programs that are complex and address multiple risk factors and effects of trafficking...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To explore {{residents}} 2 Ì† 7 {{and family}} members 2 Ì† 7 perceptions of partnership-centered long-term care (LTC) associated with implementation of the Tri-focal Model of Care. The Model promotes partnership-centered care, evidence-based practice, and a positive environment. Its implementation {{is supported by a}} specifically designed education program. METHODS: The Model was implemented over approximately 12 months in seven LTC facilities in Victoria, Australia. A qualitative exploratory-descriptive approach was used. Data were collected using individual and focus group interviews with residents {{and family members}} prior to and following implementation of the Model. Data were analyzed thematically. FINDINGS: Prior to implementation of the Model, residents described experiencing a sense of disempowerment, and emphasized the importance of communication, engagement, and being a partner in the staff-resident care relationship. Following implementation, residents reported experiencing improved partnership approaches to care, although there were factors that impacted on having a good experience. Family members described a desire to remain involved in the resident 2 Ì† 7 s life by establishing good communication and <b>rapport</b> with <b>staff.</b> They acknowledged this was important for partnership-centered care. Following implementation, they described experiencing a partnership with staff, giving them confidence to assist staff and be included in decisions about the resident. CONCLUSIONS: The Tri-focal Model of Care can enable residents, family members, and staff to be partners in resident care in LTC settings. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: With an ageing population, an increasing demand for complex, individualized LTC exists. Delivery of high-quality LTC requires a strategy to implement a partnership-centered approach, involving residents, family members, and staff...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Special Education, Counseling and Student AffairsChristy CraftAbstract Intrusive advising is {{a concept}} that {{developed}} in the 1970 s as a method of working with at-risk students by identifying challenges they faced and solutions to overcome them (Backhus, 1989). Intrusive contacts are those that make early, unsolicited contact with students in the hopes of identifying and resolving academic and social obstacles that would prevent persistence (Frost, 1991). This proactive approach has been experiencing revitalization in the current economic times due to declining funds and changing governmental funding models that would fund higher education on the basis of graduation rather than enrollment. Because 44 percent of first year students do not persist to their second year, this type of governmental funding model has profound implications for administrators (Bushong, 2009). I propose that administrators consider restructuring residence hall personnel responsibilities to include intrusive contacts in an effort to address retention issues. While residence hall personnel will not have the responsibility of scheduling classes, they can begin identifying and addressing issues earlier in the semester. This paper identifies several institutions that currently implement intrusive contacts in their residence halls and the benefits of doing so. These schools have indicated an increase in their studentsâ€™ grades, commitment and persistence, and overall satisfaction since implementing intrusive contacts (B. Silliman, personal communication, November 1, 2012). The findings also revealed that residence halls with effective intrusive contacts involve collaborative efforts between student affairs personnel and faculty members, engage students in building <b>rapport</b> with <b>staff</b> early in their first semester, and focus on developing students holistically. This report provides a summary of best practices and strategies for implementing these contacts...|$|R

Research purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate individual determinants of voluntary turnover to identify a risk-group profile. Motivation for the study: Nursing employers should have a clearer understanding of the dynamics around nursesâ€™ turnover behaviour and embark on strategies to retain their talent. Research design, approach and method: A survey measuring voluntary turnover was conducted among 262 professional and assistant nurses in three selected hospitals in Gauteng province using the McCarthy, Tyrrell and Cronin (2002) instrument. Pearsonâ€™s chi square with Yatesâ€™s continuity correction tested the relationship among the variables presented in a contingency table, in other words the risk group and each of the individual determinants. Main findings: Discontent with salaries was the major determinant of the nursesâ€™ resignation. Organisational causes were nursing practices, the work environment, physical-emotional costs and employment opportunities after resignation. Practical/managerial implications: Hospital management could indeed establish a good <b>rapport</b> with nursing <b>staff</b> while facilitating respectful and ethical conduct by doctors towards nursing staff.

40|$|Les auteurs vÃ©rifient, auprÃ¨s d'employÃ©s d'un Centre local de {{services}} communautaires, l'hypothÃ¨se de la prÃ©dominance du mode de vie sur la crise du travail. This article {{relates the}} results of research based on a case study involving the professionals and semi-professionals of a CLSC. In {{the face of a}} work crisis among this group of employees (greater accent on private life), the researchers formulated an initial hypothesis that changes in life-style could be responsible. A questionnaire based on work satisfaction, to which had been added a series of questions on lifestyle, tended to confirm this hypothesis. In-depth interviews conducted with management and employees, however, indicated that management-style went along way to explaining both resignations and loss of motivation. Life-style played rather an indirect role, in that union and political detachment left management an opening to pursue its project of rationalization and work organization. By adopting an authoritarian and bureaucratic management-style, management addressed itself first to changing the <b>rapport</b> between <b>staff</b> and clientele, making them less personal and more functional. This observation led the researchers to formulate a new hypothesis concerning the dual determination of the work process. In the production of public services, the work process is determined on the one hand by the social rapport of capitalist production (work rapport) and on the other by the rapports developed between forms of production of services and the clientele benefitting from them (clientele rapport). The second hypothesis, concerning changes in the work process of professionals, forces us to go beyond approaches insisting exclusively on the work rapport (eg classic marxism) and others (eg cultural and social movement approaches) equally exclusive regarding clientele rapport. This article is subdivided into two parts. The first deals with the initial hypothesis and attempts to identify the various approaches to the work crisis. The second presents certain results and puts the accent on the case of community organizers and nurses. In conclusion, the researchers attempt to reformulated their analysis with a view to further research. They readily admit the limits involved in such a case study. Nevertheless, they reflect on the potential of this second hypothesis in helping explain why works rationalization (and more directly Taylorization) has been put into practice at different times and with different rhythms than in the industrial sector...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ways in which staff members in the {{workplace}} of a private institution in Malaysia, realise requests in their email communications with special reference to politeness strategies as described by Brown and Levinson (1987) complemented by Spencer-Oateyâ€™s (2008) rapport management framework. It provides a pragmatic analysis of the strategies of requests speech act and politeness phenomenon in the production of request speech acts in the emails by staff members. It aims to identify the politeness strategies employed with regards to face and <b>rapport</b> management by <b>staff</b> members of different professional status when making requests in their email communication with staff members of different positions of power. It explores the lexical choices used to indicate politeness in the request emails and investigates the politeness markers used in greetings, closings and the requests phrases. It seeks to find out if there is a difference in the way they construct their sentences or whether the same structures are used when communicating with people of different positions in an attempt to analyse the correlation between social distance and the politeness strategies employed and the institutional social norms for rapport management. It also seeks to establish if recipients accommodate to politeness elements in their replies. The paper is based on the analysis of fifty request emails written by four staff members to their subordinates, peers and superior and the responses to the requests. The study is descriptive in nature and frequencies and qualitative analysis are used. The findings of the study revealed that staff members use similar forms of structural and verbal politeness forms in opening, closing and requests phrases of their emails. In their requests, they tend to use negative politeness strategies, especially with superiors or peers and direct strategies with subordinates in their requests, mitigated with politeness markers. There is a tendency to use hedges in the negative politeness strategies. It was also found that recipients accommodate politeness in their reply emails. These negative politeness strategies and mitigators are also found to function as linguistic devices to build rapport among the institutionâ€™s staff members...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. I. S.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2007. The {{advancement}} of knowledge through research {{has long been}} a major objective of higher education institutions. Most higher education institutions in South Africa strive for being 'excellent' in research. However, the 21 st century has brought some challenges to institutions of higher education in South Africa. Among the challenges encountered include the increasing pressure on academic staff to either 'publish or perish', obtain funding and a rating from the National Research Foundation and the need to be promoted. Addressing these challenges calls for institutions of higher learning to reappraise their research and development strategies and create an environment in which research of all kinds can flourish. Building capacity in research is crucial, in that it reinforces the institution's ability to improve its overall impact on research. The present study was conducted to establish the research capacity needs of academic staff in the humanities at the University of Zululand. The study intended to identify research capacity strategies and policies in p lace at the University of Zululand, determine the level of research support available for academic staff, establish the level of research competencies and skills of academic staff, examine factors influencing research productivity and recommend possible solutions that could lead to the improvement of the research environment at the University of Zululand. Due {{to the nature of the}} problem investigated, the study used a descriptive survey research design, as well as a knowledge audit process to gain an understanding of research capacity needs of academic staff in the humanities at the University of Zululand. Self-administered questionnaires, focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews were used to collect the data. The collected data was analysed using the computer program SPSS and content analysis. The overall findings revealed that research support provided to academic staff was not adequate and that correlated with the relatively low research productivity in the humanities at the University of Zululand. The study also revealed that grants for research, v access and publication, research networking, sufficient work time, teaching loads, motivation and rewards were cited as the major factors that inhibited research productivity. The study found that the university did not have formal research policy and strategies in place. It was also found that the university did not have a formal research office or centre. Based on the findings, the study recommended that academic staff should insist that the institution ensures that policies on research are established and written in black and white. The study recommended that the institution should develop a research <b>rapport</b> with academic <b>staff</b> and provide more research support for academic s taff, if the university desires to be excellent in research. This would include the development of the research centre/office that would support academics. The study further recommended a similar study, but extended on a larger scale, to include more universities and make comparative analysis of research needs of academic staff...|$|R
