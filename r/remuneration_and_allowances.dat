This background note explains the legislative basis, fixing and linking mechanisms for the allowance. Adjustments to the base salary since 1968 are provided in Table 1 and Graph 1. Background: Section 48 of the Constitution provides for the payment of Members of Parliament: Until the Parliament otherwise provides, each senator and {{each member of the}} House of Representatives shall receive an allowance of four hundred pounds a year, to be reckoned from the day on which he takes his seat. Since 1901, the Parliament has enacted legislation to define the parliamentary base salary for the purposes of Section 48 of the Constitution. The <b>Remuneration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Allowances</b> Act 1990 defines a parliamentary allowance which is consistent with the arrangements whereby the Remuneration Tribunal determines the remuneration of parliamentarians. Section 8 provides that salaries and allowances are to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Section 8 A of the <b>Remuneration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Allowances</b> Act 1990 allows the Governor-General to make regulations necessary to give effect to the Act. <b>Remuneration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Allowances</b> Regulations 2005 are now in force.

30|$|Greece’s {{collective}} bargaining {{has been described}} as centralized, unarticulated and shallow, with various levels of bargaining co-existing but each level having a low capacity of regulation (Koukiadis 2009). The content of agreements is poor, mainly dealing with <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances</b> (Yannakourou and Soumeli 2004). Enterprise bargaining outside the state sector has been rare (Zambarloukou 2006). This has dramatically changed, however. The Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF and the 2011 law for implementation of the Medium-term Budgetary Strategy Framework 2012 – 2015 provides for the possibility of ‘association of persons’ representing a minimum of 60 percent of the company’s staff to negotiate enterprise agreements, with the possibility to set wages at a lower level than provided in sector-level and occupational agreements. 14 This established a bargaining circuit outside the control of unions and contested by them.|$|E

The {{reason for this is that}} several of the problems that Asian-Pacific countries faced during the crisis of 1997 - 1999 are blamed on weak corporate governance structures. In this study we examine the determinants of Board compensation in Malaysian companies listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange over the period 1989 to 2000. Our objective is to examine whether corporate governance affects the relationship between performance <b>and</b> <b>remuneration.</b> We find evidence of a statistically significant positive relationship between Board <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> sales turnover and a statistically significant negative relationship between Board <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> ownership concentration. However, the relationship between Board <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> firm performance is ambiguous, while there is no evidence of a significant relationship between Board <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> sector performance...|$|R

40|$|The Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) {{is part of}} the Bursa Malaysia Listing Rules {{to ensure}} good {{governance}} in the capital market. This study investigates two important elements of MCCG; directors’ <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> the characteristics of remuneration committees which give recommendations on directors’ pay. However, the proposal needs to be monitored by either a non-executive or an institutional investor, or both, especially in family firms. According to the structure of a family firm, the same person is often {{on the board of directors}} <b>and</b> the <b>remuneration</b> committee. This thesis examines the relationship between <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> performance in family firms, represented by the <b>remuneration</b> committee <b>and</b> the institutional investors for 537 Bursa Malaysia listed firms from 2007 to 2009. This study finds evidence to support the hypothesis that directors’ remuneration has a significant and positive relationship with firm performance. However, this study did not find evidence that family firms influence the relationship between <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> performance. Also, the study finds that the presence of institutional investors is positively related to firm performance. However, there is no evidence showing that institutional investors influence the relationship between <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> performance in family firms. With regards to the remuneration committee, this study finds that family firms’ connections with remuneration committees has a negative relationship. Also, the study finds that the relationship between <b>remuneration</b> committees <b>and</b> <b>remuneration</b> is significantly negatively affected in family firms. This shows that the relationship between the <b>remuneration</b> committee <b>and</b> <b>remuneration</b> is dependent on the family firms. Furthermore, there is no evidence that institutional investors effectively monitor remuneration committees during remuneration in family firms. Thus, this study suggests that the relationship between <b>remuneration</b> committees <b>and</b> the <b>remuneration</b> directors of family firms does not depend on the institutional investor role. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{role of the}} Non-Executive Director (NED) {{has been}} {{questioned}} after many corporate collapses globally. NEDs in line with corporate governance codes bring independence to the board which should enhance monitoring as well as experience and distinguished networks that should benefit firm performance. Literature identified that NED remuneration has not had in-depth research conducted about it {{and that there was}} a lack of research about corporate governance issues in a South African context. The study investigates the NED <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> its impact on company performance in the financial services sector in South Africa. A quantitative study was performed on secondary data gathered over a ten year period (2006 - 2015) for NED <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> company performance measures. Company performance was measured by selected accounting metrics, ROA and ROE, and market metrics Tobin's Q and EVA. Correlation analysis was performed to determine if a relationship existed. It was found that there is a positive relationship between NED <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> company performance measured by accounting metrics and that there was no relationship between NED <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> company performance measured by market metrics. This indicates that investors do not place value on NED <b>remuneration</b> <b>and</b> the impact it has on improving firm value.
