40|$|The newest {{method to}} {{determine}} your position are satellite systems. These methods {{are based on}} the measurement of time arrival of radio signals from satellites to the receiver. Currently, the most popular system is GPS (Global Positioning System). This system is fully controlled by the Department of Defense, and only the U. S. forces and their closest allies have guaranteed accuracy offered by the system. Armies of other countries can only use the civilian version. This situation has spawned the need for an independent <b>radiolocation</b> <b>system.</b> The article describes the construction and operation of such a technology demonstrator that was developed at the Gdansk University of Technology. It was named AEGIR (according to Norse mythology: god of the seas and oceans). The main advantage of the system is to dispense with the chain organization of the reference stations, which work with each other asynchronously. This paper presents results and analysis of its effectiveness. Keywords: AEGIR, technology demonstrator, <b>radiolocation</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{comprehensive}} development of a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) -based <b>radiolocation</b> <b>system</b> including simulation of multipath and multiuser interference, estimation of time-of-arrivals (TOAs), and a distributed positioning algorithm. In {{the front end of}} the simulation, a two-dimensional ray tracing technique is used to obtain realistic channel parameters including TOAs and attenuations for each path and user. The generalized successive interference cancellation (GSIC) algorithm is then applied to the received signal to estimate TOAs. In a CDMA environment with a strong near-far e#ect, it is shown that GSIC provides more accurate time delay estimates than the single user unconstrained maximum-likelihood (UML) algorithm. Using GSIC-derived TOAs, two distributed positioning algorithms using recursive least-squares (RLS) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) are developed and employed to demonstrate the overall radiolocation performance. The RLS-based algorithm provides the benefit of low computational complexity and is derived by considering the di#erence of squared range measurements, which results in a linearized measurement model. The EKF-based algorithm fuses the range measurements in an optimal manner, including the use of a covariance-based hierarchy. Finally, simulations are presented which clearly show that the RLS- and EKF-based positioning algorithms e#ectively minimize the positioning errors caused by erroneous estimates of TOAs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} determining the statistical positional accuracy of a moving object being tracked by any 2 D (but particularly <b>radiolocation)</b> positioning <b>system</b> without requiring a more accurate reference system. Commonly for testing performance only static positional errors are measured, but typically for <b>radiolocation</b> <b>systems</b> the positional performance is significantly different for moving objects compared with stationary objects. When only the overall statistical performance is required, the paper describes a measurement technique based on determining 1 D cross-track errors from a nominal path, and then using this data set to determine the overall 2 D positional error statistics. Comparison with simulated data shows that the method has good accuracy. The method is also tested with vehicle tracking in a city and people tracking within a building. For the indoor case, static and dynamic measurements allowed the degrading effect of body-worn devices due to signal blockage to be determined. Error modeling is also performed and a Rayleigh-Gamma model is proposed to describe the radial positional errors. It is shown that this model has a good match with both indoor and outdoor field measurements.

40|$|Abstract—Cognitive radio {{devices have}} been {{considered}} as a key technology for next-generation of wireless communication. These devices {{in the context of}} IEEE 802. 11 standards and IEEE 802. 16 standards, can opportunistically utilize the wireless spectrum to achieve better user performance and improve the overall spectrumutilization efficiency, mainly in the unlicensed 5 GHz bands. However, opportunistic use of wireless spectrum creates news problems such as peaceful coexistence with other wireless technologies, such as the <b>radiolocation</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as understanding the influence of interference that each of these networks can create.
