40|$|Institute of Computational Linguistics in its fifty-year {{history has}} {{accumulated}} {{a wide variety}} of texts and corpora that have been stored in various formats and record layouts. Today, the memory of the procedures and codes of the past is still documented and the people who worked there are in service, we must thus plan a recovery strategy that maintains digital preservation and reuse. For example, one can cite texts in Latin and ancient Greek, which required a complicated system of encoding if we think that in the 60 s- 70 <b>s</b> <b>punch</b> cards with a limited set of characters available were used. This part of the work has already been addressed and equivalence tables were created, so that a full performance can be obtained, even in a non-Latin alphabet, using Unicode encoding. The problems related to text handling are mainly character encodings, based on different operating systems used over the years, the formats of the documents and the indexing system. Differences in the handling of text at different times, and content problems are among the most common. It often happens that textual materials produced in or recovered from a project of the past do not have a standard format, but are the expression both of technology and of the research needs at that time. For this reason it was decided to study of a system for the realization of procedures for transcoding the characters (from EBCDIC, passing by ASCII, to arrive at Unicode) and for indexing and treatment of any type of texts. Consequently, for a correct operation of materials recovery was made a standardization procedure of the format of the texts. This allows the disclosure and consultation with any system, open source or proprietary, while fully respecting the rights of the texts that are taken into consideration. It remains to be seen what course to take to preserve the ancient procedures in programming languages for which printouts of processing still exist: can they be preserved or should they be dropped? Can they be considered a form of "industrial archeology"? The answer to these questions may result from a comparison of opinions that the people of Grey is perhaps the most qualified to do.

40|$|Reclaimed mined lands {{often have}} {{restricted}} public access, a sit-uation that could encourage sagebrush seed growers {{to invest in}} methods for increasing seed production and improving seed purity and quality. I tested the agronomic benefit of 2 seeding methods and fabric mulch and a cross-linked polyacrylamide polymer soil amendment by using these practices to establish 3 Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young [Asteraceae]) seed orchards on a reclaimed uranium mine in Wyoming’s Shirley Basin. Seed yield was monitored for 5 y. Cased-hole punch seeding (CHPS) pro-duced more and faster growing plants than broadcasting. Seeds from plants established through mulch averaged 20 to 36 g (0. 7 to 1. 3 oz) per plant compared with less than 10 g (0. 4 oz) per plant without mulch. Polyacrylamide-amended soil pro-duced fewer seeds than untreated plots in every year of the study. Fabric mulch clearly enhanced sagebrush growth and seed yield; polyacrylamide did not.

40|$|This is {{more than}} a nice book. This is a relentlessly nice, positive, and upbeat book about Americans in the Great Depression. However {{depressing}} the Depression was economically, McGovern s aim is to show that we have not paid them Depression-era Americans the attention they deserve. We have overlooked their diverse strengths, poise, creative adaptability, and, above all, their triumphant retention of positive values and commitments despite the beleaguering and enervating powers of the Depression (p. 267). The larger question that frames the book is why, when the economic Depression in America was more severe than in many other countries, did America not experience the same social turmoil and political instability as did much of Europe, for example, fascism in Germany and Spain. A <b>s</b> the <b>punch</b> line in the old political gag declared, the best America could come up with in these momentous times was Huey Long. Not only was America free from effective threats by extremist leaders, the society, considering the times, was surprisingly tranquil; Alone in its class, the American ship of state and its crew moved in the main with a kind of classic calm through the Depression s dangerous shoals and turbulent waters (p. 267). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{humanities}} {{and social sciences}} are academic disciplines dedicated to the study of society, the economy, business, governance, history and culture. Their mission is to help people and organizations in British society reflect upon themselves, so as to better understand their established behaviours and their responses to what is new. Accounting for two fifths of students in the UK’s university sector, and a similar proportion of academic staff, these HSS disciplines have never been more critical than now for economic advances, government policy-making and the development of civil society. Some £ 75 billion of UK exports are from ‘knowledge industries’, many of which depend critically on the analysis of social and cultural behaviour (Work Foundation, 2006). Contemporary modes of ‘knowing capitalism’ and ‘intelligent government’ also make insatiable demands for information about society’s operations and for systematic analysis. So for many reasons one might have expected HSS disciplines to be seen as increasingly salient for economic transformation and public policy-making.

It constituted a major input into the Academy 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> report <b>Punching</b> Our Weight: The Role of the Humanities and Social Sciences in Policy-making (London: British Academy, 17 September 2008), produced by a group chaired by Sir Alan Wilson, FBA...|$|R
40|$|Events {{that involve}} food and eating are {{important}} parts of the daily routine in which adults and children participate in child care settings. These events {{can be viewed as}} cultural practices because they involve certain everyday ways of acting, thinking or feeling (Grusec JE et al, Child Dev 71 (1) : 205 – 211, 2000). The cultural practices around food and eating symbolise and guide the social relations, emotions, social structures and behaviours of the participants. Identities and roles for the participants are created in these practices, marked by ambiguity, movement and fluidity through ongoing processes of negotiation (<b>Punch</b> <b>S</b> et al, Child Geogr 8 (3) : 227 – 232, 2010). The formal professional systems that guide these practices in early education and care programs often focus on the nutritional value of the food, while the children and teachers involved in these mealtime events account for the intersubjective experiences. Mealtimes provide opportunities for children and teachers to interact and co-construct meaning around the situations that arise. Of special interest in this research are teachers’ and children’s intentions for communication in the context of events involving food and eating and the kind of learning embedded in the communications that occur. Throughout this chapter, these events are referred to as mealtimes. This study is informed by phenomenological theory which aims to reach understandings about interactions and their meaning {{from the perspective of the}} participating individuals...|$|R

He drank a 5 <b>s.</b> bowl of <b>punch,</b> and went away. I saw no more of him till 10 June. I saw him at my door - I asked him in; he had no shirt on, and appeared distressed. I went out to buy him a shirt and handkerchief - I told him there were hand-bills out against him for a robbery that he had done; he said he saw it pasted up in the Borough - I said he must go with me to the place, which he was willing to do; I said I did not know where the house was - he said I will shew you. We took a coach, and he said he hoped I would beg for his life, for it was the first crime that ever he did - he took me to Mr. Collison's; he ordered the coachman to pull up at the door.
