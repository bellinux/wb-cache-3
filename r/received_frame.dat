40|$|ABSTRACT — Compressed video may {{possess a}} number of artifacts, both spatial and temporal. Spatial {{compression}} artifacts arise {{as a result of}} quantization of the transform-domain coefficients, and are often manifested as blocking and ringing artifacts. Temporal limitations in compressed video occur when the encoder, in an effort to reduce bandwidth, drops frames. Omitting frames decreases the reconstructed frame rate, which can cause motion to appear jerky and uneven. This paper discusses a method to increase the frame rate of video compressed with the DCT by inserting images between <b>received</b> <b>frames</b> of the sequence. The Bayesian formulation of the restoration prevents spatial compression artifacts in the <b>received</b> <b>frames</b> from propagating to the reconstructed frames...|$|R

50|$|Asynchronous {{balanced}} mode {{added the}} concept of a combined terminal which can act as both a primary and a secondary. There are some subtleties about this mode of operation; while many features of the protocol do not care whether they are in a command or response frame, some do, and the address field of a <b>received</b> <b>frame</b> must be examined to determine whether it contains a command (the address received is ours) or a response (the address received is that of the other terminal).|$|E
5000|$|Extended Interframe space (EIFS) {{is used in}} IEEE 802.11 based WLANs. If a {{previously}} <b>received</b> <b>frame</b> contains an error then a station has to defer EIFS duration instead of DIFS before transmitting a frame. This is because, although this station {{was not able to}} decode the frame, {{it could be that the}} intended receiver could decode the frame. It should have the opportunity to return an Acknowledgment frame; the EIFS ensures the transmission of the Ack can proceed without interference from those not able to decode the frame.|$|E
5000|$|The first RBridge that a unicast frame {{encounters}} in a campus, RB1, encapsulates the <b>received</b> <b>frame</b> with a TRILL header that specifies the last RBridge, RB2, where {{the frame is}} decapsulated. RB1 {{is known as the}} [...] "ingress RBridge" [...] and RB2 is known as the [...] "egress RBridge". To save room in the TRILL header and simplify forwarding lookups, a dynamic nickname acquisition protocol is run among the RBridges to select two-octet nicknames for RBridges, unique within the campus, which are an abbreviation for the six-octet IS-IS system ID of the RBridge. The two-octet nicknames are used to specify the ingress and egress RBridges in the TRILL header.|$|E

50|$|For {{the most}} part, 802.11 RSSI has been {{replaced}} with received channel power indicator (RCPI). RCPI is an 802.11 measure of the received radio frequency power in a selected channel over the preamble and the entire <b>received</b> <b>frame,</b> and has defined absolute levels of accuracy and resolution. RCPI is exclusively associated with 802.11 and as such has some accuracy and resolution enforced on it through IEEE 802.11k-2008. Received signal power level assessment is a necessary step in establishing a link for communication between wireless nodes. However, a power level metric like RCPI generally cannot comment {{on the quality of}} the link like other metrics such as travel time measurement (time of arrival).|$|E
5000|$|Running the CRC {{algorithm}} {{over the}} <b>received</b> <b>frame</b> data including the CRC code will always {{result in a}} zero value for error-free received data, because the CRC is a remainder of the data divided by the polynomial. However, this technique can result in [...] "false negatives", in which data with trailing zeroes will also result in the same zero remainder. To avoid this scenario, the FCS is complemented (reversed for each bit) by the sender before it {{is attached to the}} end of the payload data. This way, the algorithm result will always be a magic number or CRC32 residue of 0xC704DD7B when data has been received correctly. This allows for receiving a frame and validating the FCS without knowing where the FCS field actually starts.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to power levels, {{it is also}} important to know how the 802.11 protocol acknowledges each <b>received</b> <b>frame.</b> If the acknowledgement is not received, the frame is re-transmitted. By default, the maximum distance between transmitter and receiver is 1 mi. On longer distances the delay will force retransmissions. On standard firmware for some professional equipment such as the Cisco Aironet 1200, this parameter can be tuned for optimal throughput. OpenWrt, DD-WRT and all derivatives of it also enable such tweaking. In general, open source software is vastly superior to commercial firmware for all purposes involving protocol hacking, as the philosophy is to expose all radio chipset capabilities and let the user modify them. This strategy has been especially effective with low end routers such as the WRT54G which had excellent hardware features the commercial firmware did not support. As of 2011, many vendors still supported only a subset of chipset features that open source firmware unlocked, and most vendors actively encourage the use of open source firmware for protocol hacking, in part to avoid the difficulty of trying to support commercial firmware users attempting this.|$|E
40|$|There {{is a broad}} {{consensus}} that understanding system desiderata (requirements) and design creativity are both important for software engineering success. However, little research has addressed the relationship between design creativity and the way requirements are framed or presented. This paper therefore aims to investigate {{the possibility that the}} way desiderata are framed or presented can affect design creativity. Forty two participants took part in a randomized control trial where one group <b>received</b> desiderata <b>framed</b> as “requirements” while the other <b>received</b> desiderata <b>framed</b> as “ideas”. Participants produced design concepts which were judged for originality. Participants who <b>received</b> requirements <b>framing</b> produced significantly less original designs than participants who <b>received</b> ideas <b>framing</b> (Mann-Whitney U= 116. 5, p= 0. 004).

40|$|Whereas {{there is}} {{extensive}} documentation that attribute framing influences {{the content of}} people’s thought, we generally know less about how it affects the processes assumed to precede those thoughts. While existing explanations for attribute framing effects rely completely on valence-based associative processing, the results obtained {{in the present study}} are also consistent with the notion that negative framing stimulates more effortful and thorough information processing than positive framing. Specifically, results from a simulated business decision-making experiment showed that decision makers <b>receiving</b> negatively <b>framed</b> information had significantly better recall than those <b>receiving</b> positively <b>framed</b> information. Furthermore, decision makers in the negative framing condition were less confident than decision makers in the positively framed condition.
