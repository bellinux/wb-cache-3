5|$|The {{executives}} of Columbia Records were {{not convinced that}} the album would sell well, because the project was a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> his earlier success in the outlaw movement. The album included pop, jazz and folk music styles, in addition to country. It was recorded from December 3–12, 1977.|$|E
5|$|After 1966, in a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> past policies, the Ministry of Economy {{announced}} a programme to reduce rising inflation while promoting competition, efficiency, and foreign investment. The anti-inflation programme focussed on controlling nominal wages and salaries. Inflation decreased sharply, decreasing from {{an annual rate}} of about 30% in 1965–67 to 7.6% in 1969. Unemployment remained low, but real wages fell.|$|E
5|$|As a final {{attempt to}} stop the Allied advances, the Japanese Imperial High Command planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū codenamed Operation Ketsugō. This {{was to be a}} <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the defense in depth plans used in the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Instead, {{everything}} was staked on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes would be sent to attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the Spanish {{military}} began modernizing their handguns. The extensive trials {{continued into the}} 1980s and Llama-Gabilondo proposed first, the Omni series, and then later a new model, the M-82. Both entries were <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> their normal products and used the latest technology.|$|R
5|$|The album {{features}} a heavy use of electronics augmented by orchestration, and takes {{inspiration from the}} apocalyptic artwork of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson. Stevens' use of electronics marked a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> much of his previous work—most notably from Seven Swans and Michigan. Unlike Illinois, the lyrics do not explore events, characters or setting, but deal instead with themes and emotions on a personal level.|$|E
5|$|In December 1971, {{following}} {{the defeat of}} South Vietnamese forces during Operation Lam Son 719, North Vietnamese leadership in Hanoi decided to launch a major military offensive against South Vietnam. In {{what became known as}} the Easter Offensive, the combined North Vietnamese and Việt Cộng forces employed combined arms tactics using heavy weapons that were a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the low-intensity guerrilla warfare of previous years. Although North Vietnam eventually used the equivalent of 14 army divisions, its leaders did not seek to win the war outright. Rather, their objective was to gain as much territory and destroy as many units of the South Vietnamese military as possible, in order to strengthen their bargaining position at the Paris Peace Talks.|$|E
5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West meet. It was a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period.|$|E
50|$|In {{considering}} the work {{performed by the}} Corps Observation Groups these weather conditions must {{be kept in mind}} as an element which affected the execution of each type of mission. In the matter of reconnaissance and infantry contact patrol work they produced some <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> the methods ordinarily used.|$|R
50|$|Plasma Desktop is {{the first}} {{workspace}} that was developed by KDE. It was declared mature {{with the release of}} KDE SC 4.2. It is designed for desktop PCs and larger laptops.

Nor does it propose to advocate any new ideology, but to study trends in economic policies, and to suggest a philosophic approach to the appraisal of these trends...|$|R
5|$|Following {{passage of}} the Catholic Relief Act, Charles Brownlow granted a site to the Roman Catholic parish priest the Reverend William O'Brien in 1829 for the {{construction}} of a church on Distillery Hill, now known as lower North Street. It was there that work began in 1832 on what is now St Peter's Church. In 1966, another Catholic church, St Paul's, was built at the junction of Francis Street and Parkview Street. This was a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> traditional church architecture with its grey plaster finish, copper roof, slim spire, hexagonal angles and modern design throughout. Many of its architectural features such as the copper roof and gray plaster finish are shared by the neighbouring St Paul's School. It was designed to cope with the extra demand for worship space following the growth of the surrounding Taghnevan and Shankill housing estates.|$|E
5|$|The {{assemblage}} of monumental Neolithic structures in Orkney is without parallel in the United Kingdom {{and on the}} Orkney Mainland provides an entire landscape of features from this period. During this time, complex new societies {{came to the fore}} that were a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the earlier hunter-gatherers and which were capable of creating substantial structures. The Neolithic in Scotland lasted from approximately 4000 to 2200 BC and Orkney as a whole has nearly 3,000 identified Neolithic sites all told. British archaeologists have often interpreted this era as having two distinct phases; the Earlier Neolithic dominated by regional styles of pottery and architecture followed by a relatively abrupt change into the Later Neolithic characterised by new traditions found throughout the British Isles that incorporate structures on a grander scale. In the Orcadian context, there are definite developments during the Neolithic, but the changes are gradual and tend to build on earlier ideas rather than appearing to form two distinct periods.|$|E
25|$|According to Buchanan and others, the Bush Doctrine was a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> former United States foreign policies, and a {{continuation}} of the ideological roots of neoconservatism.|$|E
50|$|Taborite {{theology}} represented one of {{the most}} <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> that of the medieval Catholic Church. They rejected what they called a veneer of corruption in the Church and insisted on the normativeness of biblical authority. Even though Taborite theologians were versed in scholastic theology, they were among the first intellectuals to break free from centuries-old scholastic methods.|$|R
50|$|The program {{offered a}} magazine-of-the-air mix of news, sports, comedy, variety, music, celebrity {{interviews}} and other short segments (along with records, usually of popular middle-of-the-road songs, especially in its later years). Its length and eclectic format were <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> the traditional radio programming structure of 30- and 60-minute programs and represented an ambitious attempt {{to respond to}} the rise of television as Americas major home-entertainment medium.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{challenges}} Mäki's {{argument about}} commonsensibles {{by offering a}} case study from contemporary microeconomics – contemporary revealed preference theory (hereafter CRPT) – where terms like "preference," "utility," {{and to some extent}} "choice," are <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> the common sense meanings of these terms. Although the argument challenges the claim that economics is inhabited solely by commonsensibles, it is not inconsistent with such folk notions being common in economic theory...|$|R
25|$|But {{the period}} {{produced}} {{a significant change}} in Weston's work. Isolated, Weston turned his attention away from landscapes and to his own wife's body. He painted her nude figure repeatedly, applying his painting techniques to the contours and curves of her body. The paintings Harold Weston produced {{came to be known as}} 'landscape nudes'—a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> traditional nudes.|$|E
25|$|He {{wished to}} reach this `holy grail' of (theoretical/ mathematical) biology, but his heavy work load during the late 1960s—despite his related health problems—took its toll, and finally {{prevented}} him in 1972 from reaching his ultimate goal. Rashevsky's relational approach represents a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> reductionistic approaches, and it has greatly influenced {{the work of his}} student Robert Rosen.|$|E
25|$|The family intrigues that {{challenged}} his succession to {{the throne}} probably contributed to John's approach to rulership, which was to appoint men from outside the imperial family to help him govern the empire. This was a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the methods of his father, who had used the imperial family and its many connections to fill almost all senior administrative and military posts.|$|E
50|$|Various bizarre {{forms are}} {{included}} here, all <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> the streamlined body plan typical of most fishes. These forms range from nearly square or triangular (boxfishes), globose (pufferfishes) to laterally compressed (filefishes) and triggerfish. They {{range in size}} from Rudarius excelsus, measuring just 2 cm in length, to the ocean sunfish, the largest of all bony fish at up to 3 m in length and weighing over 2 tonnes.|$|R
40|$|The {{universe}} {{we observe}} is homogeneous on super-horizon scales, {{leading to the}} ``cosmic homogeneity problem''. Inflation alleviates this problem but cannot solve it {{within the realm of}} conservative extrapolations of classical physics. A probabilistic solution of the problem is possible but is subject to interpretational difficulties. A genuine deterministic solution of the homogeneity problem requires <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> known physics. Comment: 6 pages.

50|$|Only {{a few of}} Cabezón's {{compositions}} survive. He is chiefly {{remembered for}} Obras de música para tecla, arpa y vihuela (Madrid, 1578), a large collection of music by his father (also including five pieces by Hernando). The Obras constitute {{the single most important}} source for Antonio de Cabezón's work. Hernando's own works include an organ setting of Ave maris stella and several keyboard intabulations. All of these pieces are of very high quality, and the intabulations are notable for their rather <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> the vocal originals.|$|R
25|$|The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, {{the most}} {{hardline}} {{of all the}} Exclusive Brethren groups, has developed into a de facto hierarchical body which operates under the headship of an Elect Vessel, currently Bruce Hales of Australia. Some defectors have accused him and his predecessors of having quasi-papal authority. This development is almost universally considered by other streams of the Plymouth Brethren movement, however, as a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> Brethren principles.|$|E
25|$|A new flying Batmobile design {{appears in}} Batman Beyond {{used by the}} new Batman (Terry McGinnis). This version of the vehicle made {{multiple}} appearances {{in the future of}} the DC Universe as flying cars were shown as commonplace technology in this future. This design is a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the usual style of Batmobiles, as they usually have a bat motif, from a bat faceplate on the grill, to tail fins resembling bat wings.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, the German {{entrepreneur}} Carl Hagenbeck {{founded the}} Tierpark Hagenbeck in Stellingen, now {{a quarter of}} Hamburg. His zoo was a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> {{the layout of the}} zoo that had been established in 1828. It was the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than barred cages, to better approximate animals' natural environments. He also set up mixed-species exhibits and based the layout on the different organizing principle of geography, as opposed to taxonomy.|$|E
40|$|In all revolutionary periods {{customary}} law tends {{to suffer from}} emotional attack and from the popular demand for shortcuts to salvation. The function of law as a guaranty of general security, {{as a source of}} reliance for the weak, as a necessary foundation for enterprise 2 ̆ 7 and commitments, as an alternative to force, corruption, and favoritism, is forgotten in the hysterical exaltation of panaceas, punitive methods, and <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> tried experience.

40|$|We {{calculate}} predictions from defect {{models of}} structure formation {{for both the}} matter and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) over all observable scales. Our results point to a serious problem reconciling the observed large-scale galaxy distribution with the COBE normalization, a result which is robust {{for a wide range}} of defect parameters. We conclude that standard scaling defect models are in conflict with the data, and show how attempts to resolve the problem by considering non-scaling defects would require <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> the standard scaling picture.

40|$|The surgery of {{congenital}} malformations of the biliary system {{has undergone a}} revolutionary change during the past decade. Although Kasai's hepatic portoenterostomy operation for biliary atresia is the most dramatic example, <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> conventional surgical treatment also have been advocated for choledochal cyst, Caroli's disease, congenital perforation of the bile ducts and biliary hypoplasia. This communication describes the lesions responsible for obstructive jaundice {{in the early months}} of life, briefly reviews standard treatment and consolidates the available information about the new operative procedures currently proposed for congenital anomalies of the biliary tract...|$|R
25|$|When the Lincoln one-cent coin {{made its}} initial {{appearance}} in 1909, it marked a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the accepted styling of United States coinage, {{as it was}} the first regular coin to bear a portrait other than the mythical Liberty which appeared on most pre-1909 regular coins. Previously, a strong feeling had prevailed against using portraits on coins in the United States, but public sentiment stemming from the 100th anniversary celebration of Abraham Lincoln's birth proved stronger than the long-standing tradition.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the {{drilling}} subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, began {{drilling for oil}} in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea using ice-strengthened drillships and an extensive support fleet of icebreaking vessels. Aiming for year-round operations, the company also began developing its own experimental icebreaker concepts to support exploration drilling and, eventually, production-related operations. The first vessel of this research and development program was the 1979-built Canmar Kigoriak which represented a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> conventional icebreaker designs with, among other features, a single-shaft mechanical propulsion system instead of a more commonly-used diesel-electric powertrain.|$|E
25|$|The 1950s were a {{significant}} period {{of change and}} reform within Anglican and other Christian denominations throughout Australia, as they sought to become more relevant to contemporary society. Developments in religious theology and liturgy, coupled with an expansionary building program, led to a <b>radical</b> <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> established architectural traditions. Reflecting international trends, church designs moved away from historical revival styles and became increasingly influenced by Modernism. However, {{it was expected that}} a church would still be recognisable as such, resulting {{in a wide range of}} variations combining traditional church elements, symbols and functions with new construction techniques, materials and forms.|$|E
40|$|The article {{provides}} a novel, conservative account of material constitution, one that employs sortal essentialism and {{a theory of}} dominant sortals. It avoids coinciding objects, temporal parts, relativizations of identity, mereological essentialism, anti-essentialism, denials {{of the reality of}} the objects of our ordinary ontology, and other <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> the metaphysic implicit in ordinary ways of thinking. Defenses of the account against important objections are found in Burke 1997, 2003, and 2004, {{as well as in the}} often neglected six paragraphs that conclude section V of this article...|$|R
50|$|Mies {{designed}} {{a series of}} four middle-income high-rise apartment buildings for developer Herbert Greenwald: the 860-880 (which was built between 1949 and 1951) and 900-910 Lake Shore Drive towers on Chicago's Lakefront. These towers, with façades of steel and glass, were <b>radical</b> <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> the typical residential brick apartment buildings of the time. Mies found their unit sizes too small for him, choosing instead to continue living in a spacious traditional luxury apartment a few blocks away. The towers were simple rectangular boxes with a non-hierarchical wall enclosure, raised on stilts above a glass-enclosed lobby.|$|R
40|$|Bell's recent paper (Bell, D. E. 1983. Risk {{premiums}} for decision regret. Management Sci. 29 1156 [...] 1166.) in this journal provides useful foundations for the regret approach to decision theory.
