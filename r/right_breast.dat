For the film she used a second-hand Bolex camera and edited it with a Steenbeck editing suite. She later recalled that she recorded the film while in her pyjamas. The production cost a total of $4,000. Fellow Canadian filmmaker David Weaver described it as sexualizing Sally's body, something that Lee had not intended. The film was first screened at the Festival of Festivals in Toronto. After graduation, Lee spent time as a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art before returning to Canada.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Milk {{ejection}} {{is essential}} for a successful lactation, however techniques to measure milk ejection in women are often complex and invasive. Recent {{research has demonstrated that}} at milk ejection, milk duct diameter increased in the breast (measured by ultrasound) {{at the same time as}} milk flow rate increased (measured using a weigh balance). This study aimed to evaluate a purpose-built continuous weigh balance (Showmilk, Medela AG) to measure changes in milk flow rate from the breast to identify milk ejections during milk expression. In addition, the Showmilk was used to determine if milk ejection occurred simultaneously in both breasts during double pumping. Methods Increased milk flow rates during single pumping were compared to simultaneous ultrasound measurements of increased milk duct diameters in 14 mothers. In addition, increases in milk flow rate were compared between the left and <b>right</b> <b>breasts</b> of 28 mothers during double pumping for 15 minutes with two separate electric breast pumps attached to two Showmilks to record milk flow rate. Results Increased milk flow rates were associated with increased milk duct diameters during single pumping. The mean number of milk ejections was not different between the Showmilk (4. 2 ± 2. 0) and ultrasound (4. 5 ± 1. 5) techniques. Overall, 67 milk ejections were measured and of these, 48 (72 %) were identified by both techniques. The left and <b>right</b> <b>breasts</b> responded synchronously with 95. 5 % of the flow rate increases corresponding between the breasts. The mean number of milk ejections identified by an increase in milk flow rate during double pumping was 5. 1 ± 1. 7 and 5. 0 ± 1. 7 for the left and <b>right</b> <b>breasts,</b> respectively. In addition, mothers chose the same expression vacuum for the left (- 198 ± 31 mmHg) and right (193 ± 33 mmHg) breasts. Conclusion The Showmilk can simply and non-invasively record milk ejections by measuring increases in milk flow rate that correspond with increases in milk duct diameter. For the first time measurement of milk flow rate has been used to confirm that milk ejections occur simultaneously in the left and <b>right</b> <b>breasts</b> during double pumping. The use of the Showmilk will facilitate further research into the relationship of milk ejection and milk removal. </p...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{presented}} a three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) –based method to separate a breast into four quadrants for quantitative {{measurements of the}} quadrant breast volume (BV) and density. METHODS: Breast MR images from 58 healthy women were studied. The breast and the fibroglandular tissue were segmented by using a computer-based algorithm. A breast was divided into four quadrants using two perpendicular planes intersecting at the nipple or the nipple-centroid line. After the separation, the BV, the fibroglandular tissue volume, and the percent density (PD) were calculated. The symmetry of the quadrant BV in the left and <b>right</b> <b>breasts</b> separated by using the nipple alone, or the nipple-centroid line, was compared. RESULTS: The quadrant separation {{made on the basis}} of the nipple-centroid line showed closer BVs in four quadrants than using the nipple alone. The correlation and agreement for the BV in corresponding quadrants of the left and the <b>right</b> <b>breasts</b> were improved after the nipple-centroid reorientation. Among the four quadrants, PD was the highest in the lower outer and the lowest in the upper outer (significant than the other three) quadrants (P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: We {{presented a}} quantitative method to divide a breast into four quadrants. The reorientation based on the nipple-centroid line improved the left to right quadrant symmetry, and this may provide a better standardized method to measure quantitative quadrant density. The cancer occurrence rates are known to vary in different sites of a breast, and our method may provide a tool for investigating its association with the quantitative breast density...|$|R

The appearance of glandular tissue in mammograms is highly variable, ranging from sparse streaks to dense blobs. Fatty regions are generally smooth and dark. Texture analysis provides a flexible approach to discriminating between glandular and fatty regions. We have performed a series of experiments investigating the use of granulometry and texture energy to classify breast tissue. Results of automatic classifications have been compared with a consensus annotation provided by two expert breast radiologists. On a set of 40 mammograms, a correct classification rate of 80 % has been achieved using texture energy analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Breast milk {{composition}} {{can be affected}} by several factors, and it can exhibit short-term (weekly) variations. Investigating variations in breast {{milk composition}} is important to accurately estimate nutrient requirements of the infant. Objective: To investigate short-term changes in breast milk composition between left and <b>right</b> <b>breasts,</b> over a 3 -week period within the first 6 months of lactation. Methods: The left and <b>right</b> <b>breasts</b> of the mothers of healthy, term infants (n = 23) were simultaneously expressed with an electric breast pump for 15 minutes, on 3 occasions within 3 weeks. Milk samples (5 mL) were collected from the total expression volume of each breast at each session. The macronutrient contents, total solids, and energy content were determined using a mid-infrared human milk analyzer. Mothers (n = 17) measured their 24 -hour milk production, and the average 24 -hour fat contents were also determined. Results: Over the 3 weekly sessions, no significant changes were found in macronutrient contents. On average, total solids (P =. 04) and energy (P =. 04) decreased by week 3 of follow-up sessions from 14 to 13 g/ 100 mL and from 82 to 76 Kcal/ 100 mL, respectively; however, these changes became insignificant when expression volume was taken into account. The macronutrient concentration was similar for {{the left and right}} breasts; however, milk composition varied markedly between mothers. Furthermore, average 24 -hour fat content was significantly lower than the mean fat content from a single expression session (P 3 ̆c. 01). Conclusion: Our findings highlight that when determining the nutritional adequacy of a mother’s milk, assuming an average concentration requires caution. The study findings illustrate the importance of using average 24 -hour fat content of milk to obtain representative measures of infant energy intake...|$|R
