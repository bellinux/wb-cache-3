We have explored the interaction of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) with Ca 2 + sensitization pathways using permeabilized mouse smooth muscle. Three conditions giving ~ 50 % of maximal active force were compared in small intestinal preparations: 1) Ca 2 +-activated unsensitized muscle (pCa 5. 9 with Rho kinase inhibitor Y 27632); 2) <b>Rho-Rho</b> kinase-sensitized muscle (pCa 6. 1 with guanosine 5 '- 3 -O-(thio) triphosphate); and 3) PKC-sensitized muscle (pCa 6. 0 with Y 27632 and PKC activator phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate). 8 -Br-cGMP relaxed the sensitized muscles but had marginal effects on unsensitized preparations, showing that PKG reverses both PKC and Rho-mediated Ca 2 + sensitization. CPI- 17 was present in permeabilized intestinal tissue. In PKC-sensitized preparations, CPI- 17 phosphorylation decreased in response to 8 -Br-cGMP. The rate of PKC-mediated phosphorylation in the presence of the MLCP inhibitor microcystin-LR was not influenced by 8 -Br-cGMP. PKC-induced Ca 2 + sensitization also was reversed in vascular smooth muscle tissues (portal vein and femoral artery). We conclude that actions downstream of cGMP/PKG can reverse PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CPI- 17 and Ca 2 + sensitization in smooth muscle...|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{activation}} of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling {{is found in}} a variety of human malignancies including melanoma, colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas. Interestingly, expression of the HCMV-encoded chemokine receptor US 28 in intestinal epithelial cells promotes intestinal neoplasia in transgenic mice, which is associated with increased nuclear accumulation of ß-catenin. In this study we show that this viral receptor constitutively activates ß-catenin and enhances ß-catenin-dependent transcription. Our data illustrate that this viral receptor does not activate ß-catenin via the classical Wnt/Frizzled signaling pathway. Analysis of US 28 mediated signaling indicates the involvement of the <b>Rho-Rho</b> kinase (ROCK) pathway in the {{activation of}} ß-catenin. Moreover, cells infected with HCMV show significant increases in ß-catenin stabilization and signaling, which is mediated to a large extent by expression of US 28. The modulation of the ß-catenin signal transduction pathway by a viral chemokine receptor provides alternative regulation of this pathway, with potential relevance for the development of colon cancer and virus-associated diseases. © 2012 Langemeijer et al...|$|E
40|$|Apolipoprotein E 3 (apoE 3) {{is thought}} to protect against {{atherosclerosis}} by enhancing reverse cholesterol transport. However, apoE 3 also has cholesterol-independent effects that contribute to its anti-atherogenic properties. These include altering extracellular matrix protein synthesis and inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Both of these cholesterol-independent effects result from an apoE 3 -mediated induction of cyclooxygenase- 2 (Cox 2). Nevertheless, how apoE 3 regulates Cox 2 remains unknown. Here, we show that apoE 3 inhibits the activation of Rho, which reduces the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions and results in cellular softening. Inhibition of <b>Rho-Rho</b> kinase signaling or direct cellular softening recapitulates the effect of apoE 3 on Cox 2 expression while a constitutively active Rho mutant overrides the apoE 3 effect on both intracellular stiffness and Cox 2.

40|$|International audienceCell {{repulsion}} {{responses to}} Eph receptor activation {{are linked to}} rapid actin cytoskeletal reorganisations, which in turn are partially mediated by <b>Rho-Rho</b> kinase (ROCK) signalling, driving actomyosin contractility. Here we show that Rho alone is not sufficient for this repulsion response. Rather, Cdc 42 and its effector MRCK are also critical for ephrinB-induced cell retraction. Stimulation of endothelial cells with ephrin-B 2 triggers rapid, but transient, cell retraction. We show that whilst membrane retraction is fully blocked by blebbistatin (a myosin-II ATPase inhibitor), it is only partially blocked by inhibiting Rho-ROCK signalling, suggesting there is ROCK-independent signalling to actomyosin contractility downstream of EphBs. We find {{that a combination of}} either Cdc 42 or MRCK inhibition with ROCK inhibition completely abolishes the repulsion response. Additionally, endocytosis of ephrin-Eph complexes is not required for initial cell retraction but is essential for subsequent Rac-mediated re-spreading of cells.

40|$|Metastatic {{cancer cells}} {{typically}} fail to halt migration on contact with non-cancer cells. This invasiveness {{is in contrast}} to normal mesenchymal cells that retract on contact with another cell. Why cancer cells are defective in contact inhibition of locomotion is not understood. Here, we analyse the dynamics of prostate cancer cell lines co-cultured with fibroblasts, and demonstrate that a combinatorial code of Eph receptor activation dictates whether cell migration will be contact inhibited. The unimpeded migration of metastatic PC- 3 cells towards fibroblasts is dependent on activation of EphB 3 and EphB 4 by ephrin-B 2, which we show activates Cdc 42 and cell migration. Knockdown of EphB 3 and EphB 4 restores contact inhibition of locomotion to PC- 3 cells. Conversely, homotypic collisions between two cancer cells results in contact inhibition of locomotion, mediated by EphA- <b>Rho-Rho</b> kinase (ROCK) signalling. Thus, the migration of cancer cells can switch from restrained to invasive, depending on the Eph-receptor profile of the cancer cell and the reciprocal ephrin ligands expressed by neighbouring cells. 11 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Classical cadherins {{accumulate}} at cell-cell contacts as {{a characteristic}} response to productive adhesive ligation. Such local accumulation of cadherins is a developmentally regulated process that supports cell adhesiveness and cell-cell cohesion. Yet the molecular effectors responsible for cadherin accumulation remain incompletely understood. We now report that Myosin 2 {{is critical for}} cells to concentrate E-cadherin at cell-cell contacts. Myosin 2 is found at cadherin-based cell-cell contacts and its recruitment requires E-cadherin activity. Indeed, both Myosin 2 recruitment and its activation were stimulated by E-cadherin homophilic ligation alone. Inhibition of Myosin 2 activity by blebbistatin or ML- 7 rapidly impaired the ability of cells to concentrate E-cadherin at adhesive contacts, accompanied by decreased cadherin-based cell adhesiveness. The total surface expression of cadherins was unaffected, suggesting that Myosin 2 principally regulates the regional distribution of cadherins at the cell surface. The recruitment of Myosin 2 to cadherin contacts, and its activation, required Rho kinase; furthermore, inhibition of Rho kinase signaling effectively phenocopied the effects of Myosin 2 inhibition. We propose that Myosin 2 is a key effector of <b>Rho-Rho</b> kinase signaling that regulates cell-cell adhesion by determining the ability of cells to concentrate cadherins at contacts in response to homophilic ligation...|$|E

In the present study, we present chemical synthesis and structure of FSD-C 10, {{as well as the}} relationship between compound concentration and ROCK inhibition. We compared the inhibitory efficiency of ROCKI and ROCK II, the cell cytotoxicity, neurite outgrowth and dendritic formation, neurotrophic factors and vasodilation between Fasudil and FSD-C 10. The results demonstrated that FSD-C 10, like Fasudil, induced neurite outgrowth of neurons and dendritic formation of BV- 2 microglia and enhanced the production of neurotrophic factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3). However, the cell cytotoxicity and vasodilation of FSD-C 10 were relatively small compared with Fasudil. Although Fasudil inhibited both ROCK I and ROCK II, FSD-C 10 more selectively suppressed ROCK II, but not ROCK I, which may be related to vasodilation insensitivity and animal mortality.

We previously showed that Cdk 5 is strongly activated during stress fiber formation and contraction in spreading cells. Here we determine the mechanism linking Cdk 5 to stress fiber contractility and its relevance to cell migration. Immunofluorescence showed that Cdk 5 colocalized with phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain (pMRLC) on contracting stress fibers. Inhibiting Cdk 5 activity by various means significantly reduced pMRLC level and cytoskeletal contraction, with loss of central stress fibers. Blocking Cdk 5 activity also reduced <b>Rho-Rho</b> kinase (ROCK) signaling, which is the principal pathway of myosin phosphorylation under these conditions. Next, we examined the effect of Cdk 5 activity on Src, a known regulator of Rho. Inhibiting Cdk 5 activity increased Src activation and phosphorylation of its substrate, p 190 RhoGAP, an upstream inhibitor of Rho. Inhibiting both Cdk 5 and Src activity completely reversed the effect of Cdk 5 inhibition on Rho and prevented the loss of central stress fibers, demonstrating that Cdk 5 exerts its effects on Rho-ROCK signaling by suppressing Src activity. Moreover, inhibiting either Cdk 5 or ROCK activity increased cell migration to an equal extent, while inhibiting both kinases produced no additional effect, demonstrating that Cdk 5 -dependent regulation of ROCK activity is a physiological determinant of migration rate.

40|$|An {{unsaturated}} fatty acid, leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4), has {{a potent}} contractile effect on human airway smooth muscle, {{and has been}} implicated in the pathogenesis of human asthma. Using front-surface fluorometry with fura-PE 3, the effect of LTC 4 on the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and tension were investigated in porcine tracheal smooth muscle strips. The application of LTC 4 induced little or no contraction despite a small and transient increase in [Ca 2 +]i. In the presence of LTC 4, however, the contractions evoked by high K+ depolarization or a low concentration of carbachol (CCh) were markedly enhanced without inducing any changes in the [Ca 2 +]i levels, thus indicating that LTC 4 increases the Ca 2 + responsiveness of the contractile apparatus. This LTC 4 -induced increase in Ca 2 + responsiveness could partly be reproduced in the permeabilized preparation of tracheal smooth muscle strips. The LTC 4 -induced enhancement of contraction was accompanied {{by an increase in}} myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and was blocked by a rho kinase inhibitor (Y- 27632), but not by either a PKC inhibitor (calphostin C) or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein). These results indicated that, in porcine tracheal smooth muscle, LTC 4 enhances the contraction by increasing the Ca 2 + responsiveness of the contractile apparatus in a MLC phosphorylation dependent manner, possibly through the activation of the <b>rho-rho</b> kinase pathway...|$|E

Intracellular [Ca 2 +] measurements performed with real time video imaging revealed that CaR stimulation with 5 mM Ca 2 +, 300 mu M Gd 3 + and with 10 mu M of specific allosteric modulator NPS-R 568, all {{resulted in an}} increase in [Ca 2 +](i) although displaying different features. Specifically, Ca 2 + as well as stimulation with NPS-R 568 induced a rapid peak of [Ca 2 +](i) while stimulation with Gd 3 + induced transient intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations. PLC inhibition completely abolished any [Ca 2 +](i) increase after stimulation with CaR agonists. Inhibition of Rho or Rho kinase (ROK) abolished [Ca 2 +](i) oscillations induced by Gd 3 +, while the peak induced by high Ca 2 + was similar to control. Conversely, emptying the intracellular calcium stores abolished the response to Gd 3 +. On the other hand, the inhibition of calcium influx did not alter calcium changes. We conclude that in our cell model, CaR stimulation with distinct agonists activates two distinct transduction pathways, both PLC-dependent. The transient cytosolic Ca 2 + oscillations produced by Gd 3 + are modulated by <b>Rho-Rho</b> kinase signaling, whereas the rapid peak of intracellular Ca 2 + in response to 5 mM [Ca 2 +](o) is mainly due to PLC/IP 3 pathway activation...|$|E

RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis showed that both RhoA and Rho kinase are expressed in CPAE cells. ICl,swell, the chloride current through VRACs, was activated by challenging CPAE cells with a 25 % hypotonic extracellular solution (HTS) or by intracellular perfusion with a pipette solution containing 100 μM GTPγS. Pretreatment of CPAE cells with the Clostridium C 2 IN-C 3 fusion toxin, which inactivates Rho by ADP ribosylation, significantly impaired the activation of ICl,swell {{in response to the}} HTS. The current density at + 100 mV was 49 ± 13 pA pF− 1 (n = 17) in pretreated cells compared with 172 ± 17 pA pF− 1 (n = 21) in control cells. The volume-independent activation of ICl,swell by intracellular perfusion with GTPγS was also impaired in C 2 IN-C 3 -pretreated cells (31 ± 7 pA pF− 1, n = 11) compared with non-treated cells (132 ± 21 pA pF− 1, n = 15). Activation of ICl,swell was pertussis toxin (PTX) insensitive. Y- 27632, a blocker of Rho kinase, inhibited ICl,swell and delayed its activation. Inhibition of Rho and of Rho kinase by the above-described treatments did not affect the extent of cell swelling in response to HTS.

In this study, we compared chondrocyte adhesion and spreading dynamics on fibronectin (FN) and bone sialoprotein (BSP). Chondrocyte adhesion and spreading were also compared with fibroblasts to analyze potential cell-type-specific effects. Chondrocyte adhesion to BSP is independent of posttranslational modifications but {{is dependent on the}} RGD sequence in BSP. Whereas chondrocytes and fibroblasts adhered at similar levels on FN and BSP, cells displayed more actin-dependent spread on FN despite a 16 × molar excess of BSP adsorbed to plastic. To identify intracellular mediators responsible for this difference in spreading, we investigated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) -Src and <b>Rho-Rho</b> kinase (ROCK) signaling. Although activated FAK localized to the vertices of adhered chondrocytes, levels of FAK activation did not correlate with the extent of spreading. Furthermore, Src inhibition reduced chondrocyte spreading on both FN and BSP, suggesting that FAK-Src signaling is not responsible for less cell spreading on BSP. In contrast, inhibition of Rho and ROCK in chondrocytes increased cell spreading on BSP and membrane protrusiveness on FN but did not affect cell adhesion. In fibroblasts, Rho inhibition increased fibroblast spreading on BSP while ROCK inhibition changed membrane protrusiveness of FN and BSP. In summary, we identify a novel role for Rho-ROCK signaling in regulating chondrocyte spreading and demonstrate both cell- and matrix molecule-specific mechanisms controlling cell spreading...|$|E

In this study, we have stably transfected the PI 3 K gamma-deficient human colon cancer cell line HCT 8 /S 11 with expression vectors encoding either wild-type PI 3 K gamma, its plasma membrane targeted form CAAX-PI 3 K gamma, or the PI 3 K gamma lipid and protein kinase-dead mutant (CAAX-K 832 R). We provide evidence that the constitutively active CAAX-PI 3 K gamma variant induced collagen type I invasion in HCT 8 /S 11 cells through disruption of cell-cell adhesion, with no apparent impact on cell proliferation and motility. The proinvasive activity of CAAX-PI 3 K-gamma was abolished by pharmacological inhibitors targeting PI 3 -K activities (wortmannin), Rho-GTPases, and the <b>Rho-Rho</b> kinase axis (C 3 T exoenzyme and Y 27632, respectively). Conversely, the wild-type PI 3 K gamma and its double mutant CAAX-K 832 R were ineffective on cancer cell invasion measured under control or stimulated conditions operated with the proinvasive agents leptin and intestinal trefoil factor.

The Rho kinase inhibitor Y- 27632 inhibited the noradrenaline (NA) -induced contraction in human saphenous veins with IC 50 corresponding to 0. 5 μM and 10. 9 μM in control and varicose veins, respectively. The maximal amplitude of the NA-induced contraction was smaller in varicose vein compared to control (1263 ± 172 mg versus 1974 ± 245 mg, P< 0. 05). In β-escin permeabilized strips, GTPγS induced a rise in tension that was inhibited by Y- 27632. The amplitude of the GTPγS-induced contraction was smaller in varicose compared to control veins (23. 1 ± 2. 4 % versus 41. 3 ± 2. 2 %, P< 0. 002). In smooth muscle cells, Y- 27632 induced disassembly of both actin cytoskeleton and extracellular fibronectin matrix. In comparison to control cells, varicose vein smooth muscle cells show decreased actin cytoskeleton organization and reduction of fibronectin matrix deposition. The Rho proteins Rnd 1 and RhoA, and Rho kinase 1 are expressed in human saphenous veins. A 2. 6 fold reduction of Rho kinase expression was found in varicose veins. These results indicate that RhoA-Rho kinase mediated Ca 2 + sensitization of the contraction and regulated actin cytoskeleton and extracellular fibronectin matrix assembly in human saphenous smooth muscle.

Here we investigated the possible roles of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins in these events. Osmotic shrinkage of Ehrlich Lettre ascites cells elicited {{the formation of}} long microvillus-like protrusions, rapid translocation of endogenous ERM proteins and green fluorescent protein-tagged ezrin to the cortical region including these protrusions, and Thr(567 / 564 / 558) (ezrin/radixin/moesin) phosphorylation of cortical ERM proteins. Reduced cell volume {{appeared to be the}} critical parameter in hypertonicity-induced ERM protein activation, whereas alterations in extracellular ionic strength or intracellular pH were not involved. A shrinkage-induced increase in the level of membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate [PtdIns(4, 5) P(2) ] appeared {{to play an important role}} in ERM protein activation, which was prevented after PtdIns(4, 5) P(2) depletion by expression of the synaptojanin- 2 phosphatase domain. While expression of constitutively active RhoA increased basal ERM phosphorylation, the <b>Rho-Rho</b> kinase pathway did not appear to be involved in shrinkage-induced ERM protein phosphorylation, which was also unaffected by the inhibition or absence of Na(+) /H(+) exchanger isoform (NHE 1). Ezrin knockdown by small interfering RNA increased shrinkage-induced NHE 1 activity, reduced basal and shrinkage-induced Rho activity, and attenuated the shrinkage-induced formation of microvillus-like protrusions. Hyperosmolarity-induced cell death was unaltered by ezrin knockdown or after phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) inhibition. In conclusion, ERM proteins are activated by osmotic shrinkage in a PtdIns(4, 5) P(2) -dependent, NHE 1 -independent manner. This in turn mitigates the shrinkage-induced activation of NHE 1, augments Rho activity, and may also contribute to F-actin rearrangement.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{determine}} the mechanisms underlying prostaglandin (PG) F 2 �-, carbachol (CCh) -, or latanoprost (a PGF 2 � analogue) -induced contraction of the pig iris sphincter muscle. METHODS. Effects of these agents on myofilament Ca 2 � sensitivity were evaluated and {{compared with the}} use of receptorcoupled permeabilized preparations by �-toxin. The effects of PGF 2 � and CCh on the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) were also analyzed. RESULTS. In the intact strips, all three of these agents induced contractions. In permeabilized strips, PGF 2 � and CCh, but not latanoprost, caused an additional tension development at a fixed intracellular Ca 2 � concentration ([Ca 2 �] i) and also shifted the [Ca 2 �] i-tension curve to the left, thus indicating that PGF 2 � and CCh, but not latanoprost, induced increases in Ca 2 � sensitivity (Ca 2 � sensitization). This Ca 2 � sensitization could have been inhibited by Y 27632, a rho kinase inhibitor, but not by GF 109203 X, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor or by PD 98059, a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor. PGF 2 � increased the level of MLC phosphorylation at a constant [Ca 2 �] i. CONCLUSIONS.
