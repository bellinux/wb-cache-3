40|$|SUMMARY: Treatment {{of adult}} ovariectomized (OVX) rats with {{strontium}} <b>ranelate</b> prevented vertebral biomechanics degradation {{as a result}} of the prevention of bone loss and micro-architecture deterioration associated to an effect on intrinsic bone material quality. Strontium <b>ranelate</b> influenced the determinants of bone strength by prevention of ovariectomy-induced changes which contribute to explain strontium <b>ranelate</b> antifracture efficacy. INTRODUCTION: Strontium <b>ranelate</b> effects on the determinants of bone strength in OVX rats were evaluated. METHODS: Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were OVX, then treated daily for 52 weeks with 125, 250, or 625 mg strontium ranelate/kg. Bone strength, mass, micro-architecture, turnover, and intrinsic quality were assessed. RESULTS: Strontium <b>ranelate</b> prevented ovariectomy-induced deterioration in mechanical properties with energy necessary for fracture completely maintained vs. SHAM at 625 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to the clinical dose. This was related to a dose-dependent effect on bone volume, higher trabeculae number, and lower trabecular separation in strontium <b>ranelate</b> vs. OVX. Load and energy required to induce lamella deformation were higher with strontium <b>ranelate</b> than in OVX and in SHAM, indicating that the bone formed with strontium <b>ranelate</b> is able to withstand greater damage before fracture. Bone formation was maintained high or even increased in strontium <b>ranelate</b> as shown by mineralizing surfaces and alkaline phosphatase while strontium <b>ranelate</b> led to reductions in deoxypyridinoline. CONCLUSION: Strontium <b>ranelate</b> administered at 625 mg/kg/day for 52 weeks prevented OVX-induced biomechanical properties deterioration by influencing the determinants of bone strength: it prevented bone loss and micro-architecture degradation in association with an effect on intrinsic bone quality.

40|$|International audienceAbstract Age-related {{osteopenia}} {{is characterized}} by a negative balance between bone resorption and formation. The anti-osteoporotic drug strontium <b>ranelate</b> was found to reduce bone resorption and to promote bone formation. Here, we investigated the implication of the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) in the response to strontium <b>ranelate</b> using osteoblasts from CaSR knockout [CaSR(-/-) ] and wild-type [CaSR(+/+) ] mice. We showed that calcium and strontium <b>ranelate</b> increased cell replication in [CaSR(-/-) ] and [CaSR(+/+) ] osteoblasts. Strontium <b>ranelate</b> rapidly increased ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation in [CaSR(+/+) ] but not [CaSR(-/-) ] osteoblasts, indicating that strontium <b>ranelate</b> can act independently of the CaSR/ERK 1 / 2 cascade to promote osteoblast replication. We also showed that strontium <b>ranelate</b> prevented cell apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL 1 beta and TNFalpha in [CaSR(-/-) ] and [CaSR(+/+) ] and [CaSR(+/+) osteoblasts, indicating that CaSR is not the only receptor involved in the protective effect of strontium <b>ranelate</b> on osteoblast apoptosis. Strontium <b>ranelate</b> activated the Akt pro-survival pathway in [CaSR(-/-) ] and [CaSR(+/+) ] osteoblasts and pharmacological inhibition of Akt abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of strontium <b>ranelate.</b> Furthermore, both the proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of strontium <b>ranelate</b> in [CaSR(-/-) ] and [CaSR(+/+) ] osteoblasts were abrogated by selective inhibition of COX- 2. The results provide genetic and biochemical evidence that the effects of strontium <b>ranelate</b> on osteoblast replication and survival involve ERK 1 / 2 and Akt signalling and PGE 2 production, independently of CaSR expression. The finding that CaSR-dependent and -independent pathways mediate the beneficial effects of strontium <b>ranelate</b> on osteoblasts provides novel insight into the mechanism of action of this anti-osteoporotic agent on osteoblastogenesis...|$|E
