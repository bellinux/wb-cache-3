5000|$|Wiring: The {{basic design}} {{involves}} stringing together bulbs {{on a wire}} and then encasing the wire in a clear plastic jacket. The number of wires depends on the functionality required of the <b>rope</b> <b>light.</b> A basic <b>rope</b> <b>light</b> has two wires, which generally allows users to make bulbs dim or flash. However, a <b>rope</b> <b>light</b> with three wires allows greater functionality including chasing, dimming and flashing.|$|E

Generally, rope lights for heavy use outdoors feature thicker plastic casings while those used for more decorative purposes indoors have relatively thin plastic casings.|$|E

Its workshop has had several locations, beginning in a temporary location near Chapeltown Road, then to the old disused Whitbread Brewery site at Kirkstall and from 1993 to the present Seacroft location. Leeds City Council was the only local authority to do this for some years but now a small number have followed Leeds Lights example in preparing their own displays where as most other councils buy in their lights and services. The lights are repaired and pressure cleaned annually at the Leeds Lights workshop in Seacroft throughout the year. 80,000 coloured lamps are stored at the workshop, and 2000m of coloured <b>rope</b> <b>light</b> are used. A team of 14 works all year round producing the display.
