40|$|New {{manufacturing}} technologies or concepts {{often are}} adopted to improve a firm's competitive advantage over other {{firms in the}} same industry. The benefits that a firm expects to receive {{as a result of}} that adoption are presumed to outweigh the risk factors that accompany the adoption of a new manufacturing technology. Much research has been conducted to characterize firms that adopt new technologies early in the technology's life cycle and to identify the expected benefits that most significantly affect a firm's decision to adopt a new technology or concept. However, very little research has been conducted to identify the risk factors that most significantly affect a firm's decision to reject a new technology or concept. Identification of those factors should be particularly important to developers of and proponents of new processing technologies, methods, and strategies. We proposed nine risk factors associated with technologies and analyzed their impact on the <b>rejection</b> <b>decision</b> by applying a multinomial logit model to a sample of wood products firms in the south-central United States. The proposed risk factors were irreversibility, difficulty of modification, incompatibility, incommunicability, time to implementation, time to realization, non-trialability, discontinuity, and indivisibility. The model also included four characteristics of firms that are regularly cited in technology adoption studies. Overall, the factors seemed to explain rejection behavior well. Results suggest that risk factors associated with the technologies are more important than characteristics of the firm when considering the rejection of a technology. Difficulty of modification and incompatibility had the most significant impact on the <b>rejection</b> <b>decision...</b>|$|E

40|$|The coevolutionary {{relationships}} between brood parasites and their hosts are often studied {{by examining the}} egg rejection behaviour of host species using artificial eggs. However, the traditional methods for producing artificial eggs out of plasticine, plastic, wood, or plaster-of-Paris are laborious, imprecise, and prone to human error. As an alternative, 3 D printing may reduce human error, enable more precise manipulation of egg size and shape, and provide a more accurate and replicable protocol for generating artificial stimuli than traditional methods. However, the usefulness of 3 D printing technology for egg rejection research remains to be tested. Here, we applied 3 D printing technology to the extensively studied egg rejection behaviour of American robins, Turdus migratorius. Eggs of the robin’s brood parasites, brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, vary greatly in size and shape, but it is unknown whether host egg <b>rejection</b> <b>decisions</b> differ across this gradient of natural variation. We printed artificial eggs that encompass the natural range of shapes and sizes of cowbird eggs, painted them to resemble either robin or cowbird egg colour, and used them to artificially parasitize nests of breeding wild robins.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} outcomes of coevolution between species is egg mimicry by brood parasitic birds, resulting from rejection behavior by discriminating host parents. Yet, how exactly does a host detect a parasitic egg? Brood parasitism and egg rejection behavior provide a model system for exploring the relative importance of different visual cues used in a behavioral task. Although hosts are discriminating, we do not know exactly what cues they use, and to answer this it is crucial to account for the receiver's visual perception. Color, luminance (“perceived lightness”) and pattern information have never been simultaneously quantified and experimentally tested through a bird's eye. The cuckoo finch Anomalospiza imberbis and its hosts show spectacular polymorphisms in egg appearance, providing a good opportunity for investigating visual discrimination owing to the large range of patterns and colors involved. Here we combine field experiments in Africa with modeling of avian color vision and pattern discrimination to identify the specific visual cues used by hosts in making <b>rejection</b> <b>decisions.</b> We found that disparity between host and foreign eggs in both color and several aspects of pattern (dispersion, principal marking size, and variability in marking size) were important predictors of rejection, especially color. These cues correspond exactly to the principal differences between host and parasitic eggs, showing that hosts use the most reliable available cues in making <b>rejection</b> <b>decisions,</b> and select for parasitic eggs that are increasingly mimetic in a range of visual attributes...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} joint {{treatment}} {{of two major}} problems that surround testing for a unit root in practice, namely uncertainty {{as to whether or}} not a linear deterministic trend is present in the data, and uncertainty as to whether the initial condition of the process is (asymptotically) negligible or not. In earlier work [Harvey, Leybourne and Taylor, 2008] we proposed methods to deal with trend uncertainty when the initial condition is assumed to be (asymptotically) negligible, together with methods to deal with uncertainty over the initial condition when the form of the trend function was taken as known. In each case we recommended a simple union of rejections-based decision rule. In the first case rejecting the unit root null whenever either of the quasi-differenced (QD) detrended or QD demeaned augmented Dickey-Fuller [ADF] unit root tests yields a rejection, and in the second case if either of the QD and OLS detrended/demeaned ADF tests rejects. Both approaches were shown to work well. In this paper we extend these procedures to allow for both trend and initial condition uncertainty, proposing a four-way union of <b>rejections</b> <b>decision</b> rule based on the QD and OLS demeaned and the QD and OLS detrended ADF tests. This is shown to work well but to lack power, relative to the best available test, in some scenarios. A modification of the basic union, based on auxiliary information including linear trend pre-test statistics, is proposed and shown to deliver significant improvements. A by-product of our analysis is that the power functions of the associated trend function pre-tests are shown to be heavily dependent on the initial condition.

40|$|In {{the context}} of regression-based (quarterly) {{seasonal}} unit root tests, we {{examine the impact of}} initial conditions (one for each quarter) of the process on test power. We investigate the behaviour of the OLS detrended HEGY seasonal unit root tests of Hylleberg et al. (1990) and the corresponding quasi-differenced (QD) detrended tests of Rodrigues and Taylor (2007), when the initial conditions are not asymptotically negligible. We show that the asymptotic local power of a test at a given frequency depends on the value of particular linear (frequency-specific) combinations of the initial conditions. Consistent with previous findings in the non-seasonal case (see, inter alia, Harvey et al., 2008, Elliott and Muller, 2006), the QD detrended test at a given spectral frequency dominates on power for relatively small values of this combination, while the OLS detrended test dominates for larger values. Since, in practice, the seasonal initial conditions are not observed, in order to maintain good power across both small and large initial conditions, we extend the idea of Harvey et al. (2008) to the seasonal case, forming tests based on a union of <b>rejections</b> <b>decision</b> rule; rejecting the unit root null at a given frequency (or group of frequencies) if either of the relevant QD and OLS detrended HEGY tests rejects. This procedure is shown to perform well in practice, simultaneously exploiting the superior power of the QD (OLS) detrended HEGY test for small (large) combinations of the initial conditions. Moreover, our procedure is particularly adept in the seasonal context since, by design, it exploits the power advantage of the QD (OLS) detrended HEGY tests at a particular frequency when the relevant initial condition is small (large) without imposing that same method of detrending on tests at other frequencies.

The performances heavily depend {{on the number of}} tenderers and on the dispersion of bid values.

The presence of multiple anomalous bids leads to a significant worsening of the performance, while courtesy bids raise both the false alarm probability and the detection probability. The use of the average-bid criterion, though officially endorsed in national legislations, is therefore recommended as a strongly precautionary criterion, i. e. when the need to avoid anomalous bids is considered much more relevant than the costs associated to deeper investigation of anomalous bids or to the erroneous rejection of regular bids.

Analyses reveal that network structure influences the interplay between the self-reinforcing dynamics of conversion and the balancing dynamics of migration. Additionally, management can minimize diffusion time and invested resources by considering the proximity of groups {{to each other and}} to the network periphery.

What we show is that when there are multiple (or even complex-valued) internal rates, each has a meaningful interpretation as a rate of return on its own underlying investment stream. It does not matter which rate is used to accept or reject the cash flow stream, as long as one identifies the underlying investment stream as a net investment or net borrowing.
