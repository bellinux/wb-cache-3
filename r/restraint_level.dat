40|$|Background—Ventricular {{restraint}} is a nontransplantation {{surgical treatment}} for heart failure. The effect of varying <b>restraint</b> <b>level</b> on left ventricular (LV) mechanics and remodeling is not known. We hypothesized that <b>restraint</b> <b>level</b> may affect therapy efficacy. Methods and Results—We studied the immediate effect of varying restraint levels in an ovine heart failure model. We then studied the long-term effect of restraint applied over a 2 -month period. <b>Restraint</b> <b>level</b> was quantified {{by use of}} fluid-filled epicardial balloons placed around the ventricles and measurement of balloon luminal pressure at end diastole. At 4 different restraint levels (0, 3, 5, and 8 mm Hg), transmural myocardial pressure (Ptm) and indices of myocardial oxygen consumption (MV ˙ O 2) were determined in control (n 5) and ovine heart failure (n 5). Ventricular restraint therapy decreased Ptm and MV ˙ O 2, and improved mechanical efficiency. An optimal physiological <b>restraint</b> <b>level</b> of 3 mm Hg was identified to maximize improvement without an adverse affect on systemic hemodynamics. At this optimal level, end-diastolic Ptm and MV ˙ O 2 indices decreased by 27 % and 20 %, respectively. The serial longitudinal effects of optimized ventricular restraint were then evaluated in ovine heart failure with (n 3) and without (n 3) restraint over 2 months. Optimized ventricular restraint prevented and reversed pathological LV dilatation (13022 mL to 9118 mL) and improved LV ejection fraction (273 % to 435 %). Measured <b>restraint</b> <b>level</b> decreased over time as the LV became smaller, and reverse remodeling slowed...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{effects of}} {{ventricular}} <b>restraint</b> <b>level</b> on left ventricular reverse remodeling are not known. We hypothesized that <b>restraint</b> <b>level</b> affects {{the degree of}} reverse remodeling and that restraint applied in an adjustable manner is superior to standard, nonadjustable restraint. MethodsThis study was performed in 2 parts using a model of chronic heart failure in the sheep. In part I, restraint was applied at control (0 mm Hg, n =  3), low (1. 5 mm Hg, n =  3), and high (3. 0 mm Hg, n =  3) levels with an adjustable and measurable ventricular restraint (AMVR) device. <b>Restraint</b> <b>level</b> was not altered throughout the 2 -month treatment period. Serial <b>restraint</b> <b>level</b> measurements and transthoracic echocardiography were performed. In part II, restraint was applied with the AMVR device set at 3. 0 mm Hg (n =  6) and adjusted periodically to maintain that level. This was compared with restraint applied in a standard, nonadjustable manner using a mesh wrap (n =  6). All subjects were followed up for 2 months with serial magnetic resonance imaging. ResultsIn part I, there was greater and earlier reverse remodeling in the high restraint group. In both groups, the rate of reverse remodeling peaked and then declined as the measured <b>restraint</b> <b>level</b> decreased with progression of reverse remodeling. In part II, adjustable restraint resulted in greater reverse remodeling than standard restraint. Left ventricular end diastolic volume decreased by 12. 7 % (P = . 005) with adjustable restraint and by 5. 7 % (P = . 032) with standard restraint. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased by 18. 9 % (P = . 014) and 14. 4 % (P < . 001) with adjustable and standard restraint, respectively. ConclusionsRestraint level affects the rate and degree of reverse remodeling and is an important determinant of therapy efficacy.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that precise estimation of road tolls for various pricing schemes requires {{a few pieces}} of information such as origin-destination demand functions, link travel time functions and users' valuations of travel time savings, which are, however, not all readily available in practice. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop a convergent trial-and-error implementation method for a particular pricing scheme for effective congestion control when both the link travel time functions and demand functions are unknown. The congestion control problem of interest is also known as the traffic restraint and road pricing problem, which aims at finding a set of effective link toll patterns to reduce link flows to below a desirable target level. For the generalized traffic equilibrium problem formulated as variational inequalities, we propose an iterative two-stage approach with a self-adaptive step size to update the link toll pattern based on the observed link flows and given flow <b>restraint</b> <b>levels.</b> Link travel time and demand functions and users' value of time are not needed. The convergence of the iterative toll adjustment algorithm is established theoretically and demonstrated on a set of numerical examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveEffects of {{ventricular}} restraint on {{the left}} ventricle are well documented, but effects on the right ventricle are not. We hypothesized that restraint affects {{the right and left}} ventricles differently. MethodsWe studied acute effects of restraint on left and right ventricular mechanics in healthy sheep (n = 14) with our previously described technique of adjustable and measurable restraint. Transmural pressure, myocardial oxygen consumption indices, diastolic compliance, and end-systolic elastance were assessed at 4 <b>restraint</b> <b>levels</b> for both ventricles. We then studied long-term effects of restraint for 4 months in an ovine model of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 6). Heart failure was induced by coronary artery ligation, and polypropylene mesh was wrapped around the heart to simulate clinical restraint therapy. All subjects were followed up with serial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to assess left and right ventricular volumes and function. ResultsRestraint decreased left ventricular transmural pressure (P <. 03) and myocardial oxygen consumption indices (P <. 05) but not left ventricular diastolic compliance (P =. 52). Restraint had no effect on right ventricular transmural pressure (P =. 82) or myocardial oxygen consumption indices (P =. 72) but reduced right ventricular diastolic compliance (P <. 01). In long-term studies, restraint led to reverse left ventricular remodeling with decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (P <. 006) but did not affect right ventricular end-diastolic volume (P =. 82). ConclusionsVentricular restraint affects the left and right ventricles differently. Benefits of restraint for right ventricular function are unclear. The left ventricle can tolerate more restraint than the right ventricle. With current devices, the right ventricle may limit overall therapeutic efficacy...|$|R

PE-EI at lunch and 12 -hours after was compared on the exercise (E) and a nonexercise (NE) day. There was a significant interaction (F (2, 33) = 4. 12, p = 0. 025) of dieting/restraint status and condition (E vs. NE day) on the 12 -hour El.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between comfort food preferences of college faculty when under normal (non-stressful) and stressful conditions. Thirty-four percent (n= 63) of the participants were males and 66 percent (n= 121) were females. Sixty-seven percent (n= 123) experienced a change in appetite when stressed, with 69 percent (n= 85) experiencing an increase and 31 percent (n= 38) experiencing a decrease in appetite. Participants chose a significantly wider variety of foods when under stressful conditions for both sweet (p=<. 001) and salty/crunchy food categories (p=. 004). High restrained eaters chose significantly more types of sweet foods (p=. 031) and beverages (p=. 020) than low restrained eaters when comparing stressful and normal conditions. These findings suggest the majority of adults may experience changes in appetite with stress, specifically an increased appetite, and may choose more types of sweet and salty/crunchy foods.

40|$|The {{reinforced}} concrete elements {{are known to}} have enhanced fire behaviour however {{there are many things that}} can affect that performance. In the last years there have been carried out, in the University of Coimbra, Portugal, dozens of fire resistance tests on concrete columns where it was tested the influence of various parameters on the behaviour of these columns. Several parameters that might have influence on the behaviour of concrete columns in fire, were tested: cross section shape (round and square), longitudinal reinforcement ratio, slenderness of the column, stiffness of the surrounding structure (<b>restraint</b> <b>level),</b> load level and the load eccentricity. The restraining level to the thermal elongation of the columns showed not being a relevant parameter in their fire resistance probably due the increase in rotational restrain associated with the increase in the axial restraint. The first increases the fire resistance while the second reduces. The increasing of the load level lead to a reduction, while the increasing of the longitudinal reinforcement ratio or the decreasing of the slenderness of the columns lead to an increasing of the fire resistance. The spalling was also an aspect analysed in these tests. The higher load levels, the shape of the cross-section, the type of concrete with or without steel and / or polypropylene fibres, and the steel reinforcement ration was parameters that showed to have influence on concrete cracking and spalling...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{the question of how}} restraint affects the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenocortical axis and the hypothalamo. pituitary gonadal axis in intact, adult female rhesus macaques in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Restraint was chosen because it is not physically harmful to the animal but rather serves primarily as a psychological stressor. Blood samples were collected from a remote site at 15 -min intervals beginning at 0700 h from tethered adult female rhesus macaques. Each animal was subjected to 6 h of chair restraint after a 3 -h control period in the animal's home cage. Samples were collected for an additional 6 h {{after the end of the}} restraint period, when each animal was returned to its home cage. Brief anesthesia with ketamine (administered through indwelling catheter) facilitated transfer of the animals to and from the chair. Blood samples were also collected from undisturbed females in both the follicular and luteal phases to document LH, cortisol, and progesterone secretion throughout the day. Plasma ACTH and cortisol, measured as indices of stress, were elevated within 15 min after initiation of restraint and remained elevated after the animals were returned to their cages. In animals sampled in the follicular phase, mean plasma LH levels were lower during restraint and remained suppressed for several hours after the animals were removed from <b>restraint.</b> LH <b>levels</b> were not significantly inhibited by restraint in the luteal phase. When the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone (Nx; 5 mg bolus plus 5 mg/h) was given beginning 2 h after the initiation of <b>restraint,</b> LH <b>levels</b> were elevated compared to prerestraint levels in both phases of the menstrual cycle.

40|$|This {{research}} project assessed both the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationship between physical self-perceptions and physical activity, cigarette smoking, restrained eating, and social physique anxiety in adolescent females by tracking these variables over one year. Participants included 641 grade ten females from various {{urban and rural}} high schools who completed the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A), the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (MAQ-A), the Smoking Behaviour Questionnaire, the Dutch Eating Behavior Restraint Scale, the Social Physique Anxiety Scale (SPAS), the What I am Like Questionnaire, and the Physical Self-Perception Profile (PSPP). Reported leisure physical activity varied greatly across the sample, but was averaged at 8. 5 hours/week. Although 65 % of the participants had tried smoking, only 29 % were currently active smokers. Of current smokers, 53 % reported smoking for weight control to some degree. Smoking for weight control {{was not related to}} body mass index, however, smokers who reported smoking for weight control {{were more likely to report}} engaging in eating <b>restraint.</b> <b>Levels</b> of eating <b>restraint</b> and social physique anxiety were moderate across the group. Physical activity levels declined from year one to year two, cigarette smoking and social physique anxiety increased, while <b>levels</b> of eating <b>restraint</b> did not change. Cross-sectional analysis revealed that negative global self-esteem and physical self-perceptions were related to physical activity, cigarette smoking, restrained eating, and social physique anxiety. Longitudinal analysis revealed similar findings, perception of body emerged as a significant predictor of eating restraint and social physique anxiety and the perception of condition was predictive of physical activity. No relation was found between the increase in smoking and changes in global or physical self-esteem. These findings suggest that perceptions of the physical self, especially that of the body, are an important component for understanding the adoption of specific health related behaviours in adolescent females. This study also found that the multidimensional hierarchical structure of self-esteem was supported for both cross sectional and longitudinal analysis and that the health related behaviours were weakly interrelated.

40|$|ObjectiveIn {{standard}} ventricular restraint therapy, {{a single}} level of restraint {{is applied to}} the entire ventricular surface. We showed previously that at high restraint levels, cardiac tamponade develops because of the thin-walled right ventricle, even while the left ventricle remains unaffected. We now hypothesize that applying restraint exclusively to the left ventricle permits higher levels of restraint, resulting in increased benefit to the left ventricle. MethodsThe acute effect of restraint applied to the left ventricle alone was analyzed in healthy and cardiomyopathic sheep hearts. Restraint therapy was applied by fluid-filled epicardial balloons placed solely around the left ventricle. <b>Restraint</b> <b>level</b> was defined by the measured balloon luminal pressure at end diastole. At incrementally higher restraint levels (0, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 14 mm Hg), transmural myocardial left ventricular pressure (Ptm = Left ventricle pressure − Balloon pressure) and indices of myocardial oxygen consumption were measured in healthy sheep (n =  5) and in sheep with heart failure (n =  6). ResultsIncreasing restraint from 0 to 14 mm Hg decreased transmural myocardial pressure by 48. 8 % (P ≤. 02) and the left ventricle tension-time index by 39. 1 % (P ≤. 01), and the pressure–volume area decreased by 58. 4 % (P ≤. 01). Similarly, stroke work decreased by 57. 9 % (P ≤. 03). Systemic hemodynamics were unchanged. There was no difference in the trend for all indices between animals that were healthy and those with heart failure. ConclusionsWe showed previously that, with standard restraint, right ventricle tamponade develops at high restraint levels, limiting restraint therapy. We now show that restraint applied to the left ventricle alone permits increased restraint levels, without causing right ventricle or left ventricle tamponade, for greater therapeutic benefit. We conclude that partial left ventricle restraint may be more effective than standard restraint...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{activity}} is recommended to facilitate weight management. However, some individuals {{may be unable}} to successfully manage their weight due to certain psychological and cognitive factors that trigger them to compensate for calories expended in exercise. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of moderate-intensity exercise on lunch and 12 -hour post-exercise energy intake (PE-EI) in normal weight and overweight sedentary males. Perceived hunger, mood, carbohydrate intake from beverages, and accuracy in estimating energy intake (EI) and energy expenditure (EE) were also assessed. The study consisted of two conditions, exercise (treadmill walking) and rest (sitting), with each participant completing each condition, in a counterbalanced-crossover design on two days. ^ Eighty males, mean age 30 years (SD= 8) were categorized into five groups according to weight (normal-/overweight), dietary <b>restraint</b> <b>level</b> (high/low), and dieting status (yes/no). Results of repeated measures, 5 x 2 ANOVA indicated that the main effects of condition and group, and the interaction were not significant for lunch or 12 -hour PE-EI. Among overweight participants, dieters consumed significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) fewer calories than non-dieters at lunch (M= 822 vs. M= 1149) and over 12 hours (M= 1858 vs. M = 2497). Overall, participants’ estimated exercise EE was significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) higher than actual exercise EE, and estimated resting EE was significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) lower than actual resting EE. Participants significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) underestimated EI at lunch on both experimental days. Perceived hunger was significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) lower after exercise (M= 49 mm, SEM= 3) than after rest (M= 57 mm, SEM= 3). Mood scores and carbohydrate intake from beverages were not influenced by weight, dietary restraint, and dieting status. ^ In conclusion, a single bout of moderate-intensity exercise did not influence PE-EI in sedentary males in reference to weight, dietary restraint, and dieting status, suggesting that this population may not be at risk for overeating in response to exercise. Therefore, exercise can be prescribed and used as an effective tool for weight management. Results also indicated that there was an inability to accurately estimate EI (ad libitum lunch meal) and EE (60 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise). Inaccuracies in the estimation of calories for EI and EE could have the potential to unfavorably impact weight management. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that Dieters would have less variation between their pre and post prandial ratings than Non-dieters. We compared 159 female college students’ hunger and satiety ratings before and after their consumption of a 420 calorie portion of Entemann’s Butter French Crumb Cake and a 9 oz cup of water. Dieter status was assigned by questionnaire responses to Lowes’ Diet and Weight History Questionnaire (Lowe, Kissileff, 2005) yielding 96 Dieters and 63 Non-dieters. Methods: The primary assumption was that of our 159 participants, the 96 Dieters, because of their lack of familiarity in using hunger and satiation as a behavioral strategy to initiate or stop eating, would demonstrate less of a difference between their fasted and fed ratings than the 63 Non-dieters. We studied whether the participants’ BMI was a factor associated with their hunger and satiety ratings and whether their ‘restraint’ level was correlated with their status as a Dieter or Non-dieter and BMI by group and the number of times participants lost weight [a component of the Early Family Eating Behavior construct. Analyses by diet group status, <b>Restraint</b> <b>level</b> and BMI were performed for the difference in hunger to fullness ratings, Race, SES, Early Family Eating Behavior and for Taste, both Prop {bitter taste} sweet taste and the sweetness of coke. Two constructs, one focused on hunger utilization and one focused on Compensation assessed the 159 participants’ implementation of these concepts. Results: Contrary to expectation, all 159 female college participants rated their fed scores higher than their fasted scores on the Visual Analogue Scale [VAS] question that asked “How Physically Full Do You Feel”. This yielded a significant result with a t of - 12. 0558 and a p-value of 0. 000. We found that there were no significant hunger and fullness rating differences between the Dieters and Non-dieters in this study. BMI varied by group [t of 5. 2467 and a p of 0. 000] with a [mean of 26. 72343 ±. 605001] for the 96 dieters compared with a [mean BMI of 22. 8090 ±. 437262] for the 63 Non-dieters and this was a significant finding. The Dieters’ Restraint scores were higher [mean of 11. 14583 ±-. 4125177] than the Non-dieters Restraint scores [mean of 6. 047619 ±. 5016249] and this was a significant finding [t of 7. 8499 and a p-value of 0. 000]. This finding illustrated the Dieters’ engagement in ‘Restrained Diet Behavior’ and was statistically significant. There were significant differences between the Dieters and Non-dieters in their Early Family Eating Behavior Construct scores (with a mean of 3. 052083 ± 1. 45363 for the Dieters) and for the Non-dieters, a mean of (1. 555556 ±. 9466031) and a [t of 7. 8619 and a p-value of 0. 0000] for the differences between the two groups. A Multiple Regression with Compensation as the dependent variable and Restraint, BMI and group as the independent variables was a significant finding for the use of compensation behaviors as measured by the compensation construct and differential use by the two groups [t of - 1. 97 and p-value of 0. 000]. A Multiple Regression with BMI scores as the dependent variable and group, Restraint, Hunger for the Next meal, Sweet taste ratings, Compensator scores, Early family Eating Behaviors, Diet to Avoid Gaining Weight and ‘I wish I weighed less’ as the independent variables showed significance for the EFEB construct [t of 6. 18 p-value of 0. 00] and ‘I wish I weighed less’ [t of 3. 44 and p-value of 0. 0001]. BMI was significantly associated with our participants’ class in college [f of 25. 03 and p-value of 0. 000] their current Age [f of 14. 94 and p-value of 0. 0002] and BMI was significant for the number of times our participants lost weight, a dichotomous component on the Early Family Eating Behavior Construct where a score of three weight loss attempts or more scored a 1 and two or fewer weight loss attempts was scored a 0 [f of 16. 93 and a p-value of 0. 0001]. Implications: It was an important finding that a healthy BMI was achieved and maintained by 101 of the 159 { 50 were Dieters and 51 were Non-dieters} students in our study. We also found that eating behavior on the college campus today included a focus on ‘watching what they ate in order not to gain weight’ (Nichter, Ritenbaugh, Nichter, Vuckovic, Aicken, 1995) as well as dieting and non-dieting behaviors. Dieting, historically, was believed to be equivalent to Restrained Eating by Polivy and Herman (Herman, Polivy, 1975; Lowe, Foster, Kerzhnerman, Swain, Wadden, 2001 p 254)) but there is now debate as to whether Dieting and Restrained Dieting do not reflect the same eating behaviors in those Non-obese, with BMI’s below 30 (Lowe, Doshi, Katteran, Feig, 2013, p 1). It is a positive outcome, we believe, that the 63 {Non-dieters} do not to ‘diet’ for weight loss, but our results also indicate that an educational intervention teaching the utilization of hunger and satiety sensations to those ‘chronically dieting’ (46) students with BMI’s outside the normal range is still necessary on the University campus...|$|E

Information about the persons involved comprises demographics, intoxication <b>level,</b> <b>restraint</b> use, license validity and injury severity. Information about the vehicles involved contains make and model, weight, registration date, maneuvers, and collision point.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of an expected future voluntary export <b>restraint</b> on the <b>level</b> of firms' current exports to a market. The traditional result that current exports increase is shown {{to depend on the}} degree of collusion in the exporting industry and the anticipated restrictiveness of the VER. The former relationship is tested by reference to the effect of EC import surveillance on its imports. Surveillance is argued to indicate an increased probability of a VER in the future, and it is found that while competitive industries respond to it by increasing exports to the EC, less competitive ones curtail exports. This constitutes one of the few empirical tests of the strategic part of strategic trade policy...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} recent micro-evidence on {{the productivity of}} Indian firms, helping to explain why India’s manufacturing sector has not performed {{as well as many}} observers expected. A series of structural distortions are documented, all of which may depress the performance of manufacturing, and thus the economy as a whole. These distortions exist at multiple levels, and reflect long-standing problems with the reallocation of labour across sectors, the excessively small scale of firms, low firm turnover, poor product market integration, high industry concentration and persistent state ownership. Combined, these phenomena represent severe <b>restraints</b> on the <b>level</b> and growth of productivity in manufacturing, and suggest that much remains to be done to improve the strength and sustainability of India’s development path. ...|$|R
50|$|Mercedes Benz also {{produces}} a police spec {{model of the}} S-600, the S-600P. The S-600P {{is similar to the}} standard S-600, but is equipped with the dual turbocharged V-12 engine of the S65 AMG and includes police lights, siren, run flat tires, a gun mount, a Lanix computer station integrated with the host police network, optional prisoner cage and <b>restraint</b> seats, and <b>level</b> B6/B7 armoring. The S-600P is only built in Mexico and only comes in long-wheelbase version. The Mexican government uses S-600Ps mainly for transporting important figures, but several police departments in wealthier cities in the country use them as patrol vehicles, as does the Mexican Federal Police in limited numbers. A small number of S-600P were purchased by the police department of Guangzhou, China, for protection of key government figures.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{of police and}} mass media interventions on the rate of restraint use by car occupants in the regional city of Whyalla and in rural South Australia, was evaluated by the Road Accident Research Unit of the University of Adelaide using data supplied by Transport SA. The trial was evaluated by examining observations of restraint use before (February 1998) and directly after the campaign (December 1998) and then three months later following a second campaign (March 1999). These results were also compared with self reported restraint use telephone surveys completed before (May 1998) and directly after the intervention (December 1998). Observed <b>restraint</b> use <b>levels</b> for all vehicle occupants increased in Whyalla from 84 per cent in February 1998, to 93 per cent in December 1998. This increase was maintained four months later after supplementary education and enforcement. The increase brought the <b>level</b> of <b>restraint</b> use in Whyalla up to that of metropolitan Adelaide. Two other rural regions in South Australia also experienced increases in restraint use, {{but not to the}} same extent as in Whyalla. Self reporting surveys showed a substantial increase in the knowledge of penalties incurred for seat belt non-compliance following the intervention. The interventions were followed by a large increase in restraint use, at least part of which appeared to result from the interventions...|$|R
40|$|Deaths {{from rural}} road crashes {{continue}} {{at a higher}} rate per head of population than that for major cities, with the risk of dying on rural roads exceeding that on motorways by four to six times. In response to such evidence and the paucity of research specifically examining rural road trauma, a five-year multi-component study aimed at increasing knowledge about rural and remote road crashes and informing road safety policy was designed. This paper presents some initial results from two components of the study: interviews with road crash patients admitted to hospital between March 2004 and May 31 2006; and interviews with road users passing the sites where the hospital interviewees’ crashes occurred 1 - 2 weeks previously. Demographic data, use of safety <b>restraints</b> and helmets, <b>levels</b> of drinking and attitudes to road safety practices and enforcement are reported...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine novel small-molecule agents influencing the pathogenesis of gastric lesions induced by stress. To achieve this goal, four novel organic compounds containing structural fragments with known antioxidant activity were synthesized, characterized by physicochemical methods, and evaluated in vivo at water immersion <b>restraint</b> conditions. The <b>levels</b> of lipid peroxidation products and activities of antioxidative system enzymes were measured in gastric mucosa and correlated with the observed gastroprotective activity of the active compounds. Prophylactic single-dose 1 [*]mg/kg treatment with (2 -hydroxyphenyl) thioacetyl derivatives of L-lysine and L-proline efficiently decreases up to 86 % stress-induced stomach ulceration in rats. Discovered small-molecule antiulcer agents modulate activities of gastric mucosa tissue superoxide dismutase, catalase, and xanthine oxidase in concerted directions. Gastroprotective effect of (2 -hydroxyphenyl) thioacetyl derivatives of L-lysine and L-proline at least partially depends on the correction of gastric mucosa oxidative balance...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} role of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus remains {{the subject of}} intense speculation. One recent hypothesis is that adult-born neurons contribute to the endocrine and behavioural outputs of the stress response. Here we show a genetic model system to ablate neurogenesis by inducibly deleting Tbr 2 gene function specifically in the hippocampus and corroborate our findings in a radiation-based model of neurogenesis deprivation. We found that mice with ablation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus exhibit reduced anxiety during the dark cycle. After <b>restraint</b> stress, corticosterone <b>levels</b> in neurogenesis-deficient mice decreased more quickly than controls and were more sensitive to suppression by dexamethasone. Furthermore, glucocorticoid receptor target genes and neuronal activity markers showed reduced expression after stress in neurogenesis-deficient mice. These findings suggest that newborn neurons in the hippocampus are involved in sensing and eliciting an appropriate response to stress...|$|R
40|$|Cold exposure, {{especially}} {{early in}} life, can be stressful. We examined if cold exposure affects HPA axis sensitivity and global DNA methylation {{in the brain}} in Australian zebra finches (Taenopygia gutta). We hypothesized that cold exposure {{during the first two}} weeks post-hatch alters HPA sensitivity and global brain DNA methylation levels in juveniles and adults. Control birds showed the predicted elevation in plasma corticosterone (Cort) after restraint stress in adulthood, however cold exposed birds exhibited a blunted Cort response. There {{was no significant difference in}} global methylation levels between treatments. Juveniles showed no significant difference between baseline and <b>restraint</b> plasma Cort <b>levels,</b> but cold exposed birds had significantly lower methylation levels. DNA methylation studies suggest that both hypomethylation on a global scale and hypermethylation in specific gene sequences can occur after adverse early life events. The attenuated Cort response could protect against the noxious effects of prolonged glucocorticoid secretion...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{explores the}} {{similarities}} between individual and group eating and weight concerns in 8 - 11 -year-old children. It also evaluates whether child anxiety moderates the relationships between individual and group eating and weight concerns. Methods: One hundred and fifty four children aged 8 - 11 completed questionnaires concerning their friendship groups, their eating and weight concerns, and their levels of anxiety. Results: Children's own scores on dietary restraint, body dissatisfaction, and external eating were significantly correlated with their friendship groups' scores on dietary restraint. Child anxiety moderated the relationships between group dietary restraint and individual scores on external eating. Group <b>levels</b> of dietary <b>restraint</b> predicted higher <b>levels</b> of external eating in children with moderate or high anxiety. Conclusions: In pre-adolescent children, peer group <b>levels</b> of dietary <b>restraint</b> are related to individual eating and weight concerns. More anxious children may be more susceptible to peer influences on their eating behaviors...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{accidental}} or unplanned extubation associated with the transport of critically ill patients. Nurses should develop strategies to make an effective transportation qualification aimed at nursing care and patient safety. This is a computerized literature search, conducted in electronic databases in order to answer the clinical question flaming: On account of high complexity, which is {{the effectiveness of a}} safe transportation of patients to prevent accidental extubation? These met the inclusion criteria for this study, we analyzed ten articles. Some articles dealt with the accidental extubation as an adverse event associated with nursing care at four moments where the incidence of accidental extubation was higher, others have made membership of accidental extubation with levels of sedation, physical <b>restraint</b> and <b>level</b> of consciousness. One article dealt with the anxieties and concerns of the nurse specialist to perform a patient transport and how to deal with these feelings. Only two articles have focused on the safe transport of critically ill patients in order to avoid not only the accidental extubation, but also other adverse events that jeopardize patient safety. The implementation of pre-transport protocols will minimize the risk of adverse events during transport of critically ill patients, because this tool provides grants to assist in the provision of nursing care through major approaches that resemble some of the nursing care essential, and that get overlooked because of the stress experienced by the transport. You can offer a skilled nursing care and the patient-centered care through initiatives aimed at developing research-based evidence, in order to achieve the best intervention and providing better results...|$|R
40|$|Mast cells (MCs) {{deficient}} rats (Ws/Ws) {{were used}} to investigate the roles of MCs in visceral hyperalgesia. Ws/Ws and wild control (+/+) rats were exposed to T. spiralis or submitted to acute cold <b>restraint</b> stress (ACRS). <b>Levels</b> of proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR 2) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were determined by immunoblots and RT-PCR analysis, and the putative signal pathways including phosphorylated extracellular-regulated kinase (pERK 1 / 2) and transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV 1) were further identified. Visceral hyperalgesia triggered by ACRS was observed only in +/+ rats. The increased expression of PAR 2 and NGF was observed only in +/+ rats induced by T. spiralis and ACRS. The activation of pERK 1 / 2 induced by ACRS occurred only in +/+ rats. However, a significant increase of TRPV 1 induced by T. spiralis and ACRS was observed only in +/+ rats. The activation of PAR 2 and NGF via both TRPV 1 and pERK 1 / 2 signal pathway is dependent on MCs in ACRS-induced visceral hyperalgesia rats...|$|R

40|$|Seniors with {{dementia}} who enter long-term care facilities are {{at greater risk}} of death than are similar individuals that remain in the community. Previous research has focused primarily on social selection factors such as health status to explain mortality in this population. This study seeks to determine whether resident mortality within 12 months of admission to a facility can be explained by post-admission social causative factors, that is, by institutional quality of care. Logistic regression results are based on the study of 402 residents in 73 long-term care facilities throughout British Columbia, Canada. Mortality data were obtained from Vital Statistics. Although social selection factors (e. g., physical dependency) emerge as the strongest predictors, one social causative factor – facility <b>level</b> <b>restraint</b> use – also predicts mortality. This study provides some evidence that social causative factors play a role in determining mortality among long-term care residents {{with dementia}}. Further research on the social causative factors is needed to understand {{the degree to which they}} affect mortality, and the way in which they do so...|$|R
