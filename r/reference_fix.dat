40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} values and locations of Miles-in-Trail restrictions used within the National Airspace System {{over the last three}} years. Using specific severe weather avoidance routes, various locations are selected to implement the Miles-in-Trail restrictions to study their individual impact on the delay of flights and sector congestion in the airspace. The current traffic management operational infrastructure lacks the modeling of multiple restrictions with passback Miles-in-Trail values to upstream facilities. The model developed here allows implementation of multiple restriction locations for multiple merging streams of traffic. The model also permits speed control, vectoring or airborne holding, and passback of restrictions to upstream facilities. The simulation environment allows implementation of these restrictions, enabling a what-if capability in a rapid evaluation mode for Miles-in-Trail impact. Preliminary results are presented for delay of impacted flights due to implementation of three different playbook routes and Miles-in-Trail values at various locations with passbacks to upstream facilities. Results of sector congestion in the airspace for those cases are discussed as well. It was observed that for a particular playbook route implementation with Miles-in-Trail between 25 and 30 nmi applied at a <b>reference</b> <b>fix</b> resulted in low total delay and sector congestion. Overall, the model appears to be a good starting point for evaluation of passback restriction impact and, with operational feedback, could be used for advising passback values to upstream facilities.

We prove the existence of a uniform lower bound on K for Torelli-K-quasiconformally homogeneous Riemann surfaces. This is a special case of the open problem of the existence of a lower bound on K for (in general non-Torelli) K-quasiconformally homogeneous Riemann surfaces.
