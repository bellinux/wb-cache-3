50|$|Roof crush: When {{a vehicle}} rolls over {{and ends up}} on its roof, {{the weight of the}} vehicle may cause the roof of the vehicle to collapse, {{potentially}} crushing the occupants of the vehicle. <b>Roof</b> <b>crush</b> injury risks are higher in vehicles with a greater propensity to roll over. <b>Roof</b> <b>crush</b> kills or inures thousands of people every year.|$|E

5000|$|Observations {{from school}} bus and heavy truck rollovers also {{suggests}} that the fall and dive theories are incorrect [...] and that another theory of the mechanism of injury in rollover accidents is required, one that relates injury to the intrusion of the roof structure into the occupant compartment or more simply to [...] "roof crush". Today it is generally realized that the primary injury mechanism in light vehicle rollover accidents is not crushing. Rather, it is widely acknowledged that the principal injury process for contained,i.e., non-ejected, occupants involves the impact between the occupant and the vehicle interior. Since the severity of an impact depends {{to a large extent}} on the relative velocity between the impacting objects; the impact theory of injury causation in rollovers has sought to explain the increase in injuries associated with increased <b>roof</b> <b>crush</b> with an increase in the relative velocity between the occupant and the vehicle's interior which is generated by the <b>roof</b> <b>crush.</b> In the simplest terms, when the occupants hits a collapsing roof, they hit harder because the roof is moving in on them. If the roof was not collapsing, and thus moving towards the occupants, their velocity relative to the roof would be lower and the impact less severe.|$|E

5000|$|Every year {{approximately}} 10,000 Americans {{are killed}} in rollover accidents, accounting for about 30% of all light vehicle occupant fatalities. [...] The number of occupant injuries is significantly higher. The relationship between injury levels and intrusion or <b>roof</b> <b>crush</b> has been statistically established, but the mechanism has been thought sometimes {{to be somewhat}} obscure. Theories advocating the idea that rollover injuries are caused by the occupants [...] "falling" [...] or [...] "diving" [...] into the vehicles interior have been advanced, but the severity of these events, and thus their potential for causing injury, has been questioned.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>crush</b> {{has also}} been {{identified}} as a cause of both full and partial ejection in rollover accidents because of ejection portals created by the collapsing roof structure. These chiefly involve broken windows but occasionally also involve the body structure. The current Federal regulation involving roof strength - 49 CFR 571.216 (FMVSS 216) - has been found to offer little benefit [...] and is currently being reviewed. Many European manufacturers provide stronger roofs than do U.S. or Asian manufacturers despite {{the fact that there is}} no European (EEC) roof strength regulation for light vehicles. The Volvo XC90 may be a good example of this.|$|E
5000|$|Roof pillars {{may appear}} strong {{to the average}} consumer, {{but many of them}} are {{constructed}} only of sheet metal that is hollow on the inside at the cross sections.

Vehicle design is supposed to depend on a structural support system that creates a [...] "survival space" [...] that protects car occupants in a crash from injury due to <b>roof</b> <b>crush.</b> A weak roof makes a vehicle defective, and roof crushes can cause serious injuries. In 1973, the government passed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 216, creating a standard roof strength test to measure the integrity of roof structure in motor vehicles. Despite federal standards, some vehicle roofs may crush by a foot or more during a rollover accident.|$|E

At impact, force applied to the steering wheel curled the column jacket back over a mandrel mounted on the floor.

About 22% of the offices in Kobe's central business district were rendered unusable, and over half of the houses in that area were deemed unfit to live in. High rise buildings that were built after the modern 1981 building code suffered little; however, those that were not constructed to these standards suffered serious structural damage. Most of the older traditional houses had heavy tiled roofs which weighed around two tons, intended to resist the frequent typhoons that plagued Kobe, but they were only held up by a light wood support frame.

40|$|Vehicle {{crashworthiness}} {{refers to}} proper designing {{of the vehicle}} structure {{to reduce the risk}} of death and injury during the vehicle accidents. In the recent years, due to the enforcement of new EU normative, the interest of all the car manufacturers in producing lightweight vehicles is progressively increased as the combustion engine optimization has already used most of the improvements they had and the residual ones are becoming more and more difficult and costly. Based on this auto industry's interest, lightweight materials such as composite have absorbed lots of attention due to their superior characteristic of high stiffness to weight ratio. In this thesis, efforts have been made to present a broad research on the light-weight design of vehicle roof panel for stiffness and crash analyses. The first part of the analyses belongs to the vehicle chassis static and dynamic stiffness analyses via the finite element code with the specific focus on substituting the steel roof panel with the lightweight materials of aluminum and composites. The structural response of the vehicle roof panel, made of different solutions, in full frontal crash with respect to NHTSA standard has been investigated at the second step. The effects of increasing the vehicle roof panel thickness at the both steps have been tested and compared for different solutions. At the third step an innovative design solution for the vehicle roof structure has been developed and tested in rollover crash analysis. In order to perform this task, After determining the performance of tubes made of steel, composite and composite foam-filled solutions under the three points bending test and proving the efficiency of composite-foam design; the same idea is implemented on the vehicle roof panel during the <b>roof</b> quasi-static <b>crush</b> test. Besides the composite solutions, the sandwich design consists of composite face-sheets and foam core are tested in the <b>roof</b> <b>crushing</b> test based on the FMVSS 216 standard. After assessment of the sandwich <b>roof</b> panel in <b>crushing</b> test, the geometrical optimization of the foam core is implemented to determine the optimum design with respect to vehicle strength-to-weight ratio and mass reduction percentages. Besides different foam core configurations that have been tested, the final optimization have been implemented using the foam core with various densities and also the optimum face-sheets thickness has been determined. At the last chapter, challenges of vehicle composite roof panel assembly have been discussed. Results in the case of stiffness and frontal crash analyses at step one and step two proved that although the composite solutions have lower energy absorption capacity in comparison with the steel one, they have large contribution to the weight reduction of the vehicle roof panel and still stays in the acceptable range of structural performance. Using the new design of sandwich solutions in <b>roof</b> <b>crushing</b> test have proved that while theses designs have reduced the vehicle roof panel weight by 68 %, they have the same structural performance as the steel solution and could be considered as interesting solutions. Evaluating the behavior of the vehicle roof structure made of different solutions with various configurations under distinct analyses of stiffness and crashworthiness will help to improve the vehicle roof structure performance...|$|R

Currently, FMVSS No. 216 sets requirements for <b>roof</b> <b>crush</b> resistance using a quasi-static load applied to the vehicle roof. This load application is not representative of real-world loading rates of roof structures in a rollover collision. A series of tests comparing quasi-static roof loading versus dynamic roof loading was conducted to determine how static and dynamic tests can be correlated and if static test can be transformed to a dynamically equivalent result. Nine vehicles were selected for the quasi-static tests. Subsets of this group were subject to 1) FMVSS 216 test procedure, 2) incremental crush testing, and 3) modified crush angle (roll and pitch.) Each vehicle was then ranked for performance, based on roof strength and stiffness. Based on the roof structure performance of the quasi-static tests, six vehicles were tested by dropping them on their roofs (dynamic drop test.) Dynamic force vs. crush and energy vs. crush were plotted. The slope of the dynamic energy vs. crush plots were compared to the static tests. The slopes of the dynamic test were 1. 1 to 1. 6 times the static crush slopes for all six vehicles.

40|$|December 2006. "Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. Today transit buses are an {{integral}} part of the national transportation system. According to National Transportation Statistics from 1990 to 2002, the number of transit motor buses in the U. S. has increased 30 percent. Although buses are one of the safest means of transportation, occupant injuries and fatalities in bus crashes do occur. Rollover strength has become an important issue for bus and coach manufacturers. Today European regulation “ECE-R 66 ” is in force to prevent catastrophic rollover accidents. The Standard Bus Procurement Guidelines (SBPG) of the American Public Transit Association (APTA) also mentions the <b>roof</b> <b>crush</b> test for the assessment of bus superstructure and roof. This thesis discusses the development of a finite element (FE) model of a bus, and the analysis of its <b>roof</b> <b>crush</b> and rollover in LS-DYNA. The FE model was validated for the <b>roof</b> <b>crush</b> test carried according to the standard bus procurement guidelines (SBPG). ADAMS-View software was used to simulate the rollover of the bus. Bus accelerations, velocities, and its angle with the ground just before impact were measured in ADAMS and then used as input for the LSDYNA analysis. According to the ECE-R 66 regulation, a passenger’s survival space is defined in the bus model to check whether there is any intrusion into the survival space during or after the rollover. This ensures that the bus structure has sufficient strength to avoid intrusions into the survival space. The effect of passengers’ weight on energy absorbed by the bus structures during rollover is also discussed. Development of the MADYMO bus model and its rollover simulations were also included in this research. Dummy kinematics and injuries sustained during rollover for various seated and standing positions were studied as well...|$|E

We have conducted M 216 and JRS tests on 17 production vehicles to determine <b>roof</b> <b>crush</b> and crush velocities at a number of points in the interior. These tests included complete production vehicles, body bucks at reduced weight to increase the effective roof strength-to-weight ratio, and pairs of identical vehicles where one has had the roof reinforced in a manner that is entirely hidden by the vehicle’s sheet metal and upholstery. Data from the JRS tests and the M 216 tests are compared with the results of FMVSS 216 tests. Analyses of the data highlight the relative value and validity of each test methodology, its ability to predict roof performance in actual rollovers, its use in vehicle roof structure design, and its potential contribution to regulation or consumer information. Based on the <b>roof</b> <b>crush</b> and crush speed in the vicinity of front seat occupants ’ heads, we propose a rollover crashworthiness ranking system.

40|$|Head, {{face and}} neck (HFN) {{injuries}} associated with upper interior contacts account for {{a large percentage of}} all serious to fatal injuries annually. In the past, many of these injuries were the result of unrestrained occupants in rollovers and side impacts. Mandatory belt use laws have helped keep the head and torso inside the vehicle, but HFN injuries in side and rollover accidents persist. Regulatory actions for side and rollover protection deal with torso injuries but head injuries have been addressed only by upper interior padding. Rollovers have been characterized as violent events and <b>roof</b> <b>crush</b> as the natural consequence of such violence. The original claims were based in part on the “Malibu” experiments, which suggested that head and neck injuries for occupants are unavoidable even with improved roof strength and the use of production restraints. An analytical effort to understand rollover injuries, using the field accident data of the NASS files and residual headroom as an indicator, was reported by the authors at the 1996 ESV conference in Melbourne, Australia. This work led to a revised theory of rollover head, {{face and neck}} (HFN) injury mechanisms and their relationship to, for example, <b>roof</b> <b>crush,</b> headroom, restraint excursion, padding, glazing and vehicle geometry.
