500|$|But this wider aim proved {{impossible}} to achieve: {{the government was}} circumspect as rehabilitating the Waffen-SS would have {{opened the door to}} claims by personnel of other SS and Nazi organisations, including SA, SD, Hitler Youth, and others—a prospect the federal government would <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> raised either domestically or internationally. The public image of the organisation was not helping either, because some of the more outspoken HIAG members sounded [...] "alarmingly Nazi in their pronouncements", according to Large.|$|E
500|$|Century Falls is conceptually much {{darker than}} its {{predecessor}} Dark Season and his later work, which Davies attributed to a trend that inexperienced writers [...] "get off on the dark stuff": in a BAFTA interview with Davies, Home recalled that she [...] "very nearly got into trouble because it did actually push at the boundaries which some of the powers-that-be would <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been pushed"; and a Daily Mail review of the series considered the show's themes of arson, black magic, and communal fear as being [...] "on a scale normally reserved for peak-time adult viewing". The series offered a sense of realism in its protagonist, who is not heroic and aspirational, has poor social skills, and is bluntly described by Ben as a [...] "fat girl", a practice that the Daily Mail praised as [...] "something that defies the Thought Police". Century Falls was the last script he wrote for the BBC's children's department for fourteen years. He had begun to formulate another successor: The Heat of the Sun, a series set over Christmas 1999 and New Year's Day 2000 that would have included the concepts of psychic powers and world domination.|$|E

2500|$|Hunter was not {{implicated in}} the Duke Cunningham/Brent R. Wilkes congressional bribery scandal. In December 2005, Hunter {{directed}} that the contributions his campaign received from Wilkes and Wade {{be given to the}} Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund. [...] "We had options," [...] said Bruce Young, treasurer for Hunter's re-election campaign. [...] "We could keep the money, send it back, send it to the government or send it to a charity. We just felt that because of the situation, we would <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the money." [...] More than 100 members of the House and Senate – Republicans and Democrats – accepted money from Wilkes, former MZM Inc. president Mitchell Wade, their relatives, employees or political action committees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign watchdog group.|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 2016, emails were {{obtained}} that revealed Powell's private communications regarding both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Powell privately reiterated his comments regarding Clinton's email scandal, writing, [...] "I have told Hillary's minions repeatedly {{that they are}} making a mistake trying to drag me in, yet they still try," [...] and complaining that [...] "Hillary’s mafia keeps trying to suck me into it" [...] in another email. In another email discussing Clinton's controversy, Powell noted {{that she should have}} told everyone what she did [...] "two years ago", and said that she has not [...] "been covering herself with glory." [...] Writing on the 2012 Benghazi attack controversy surrounding Clinton, Powell said to then U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice, [...] "Benghazi is a stupid witch hunt." [...] Commenting on Clinton in a general sense, Powell mused that [...] "Everything [...] touches she kind of screws up with hubris", and in another email stated [...] "I would <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Stevens filed a brief dissent. Though {{he agreed}} with the majority’s {{determination}} that a supervisor may take corrective action against [...] "inflammatory or misguided" [...] speech, he questioned whether the same logic applies against [...] "unwelcome speech" [...] that [...] "reveals facts that the supervisor would <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> anyone else discover." [...] Citing Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District (1979), Justice Stevens emphatically disagreed {{with the notion that}} there was a categorical difference between speech uttered by a citizen or by an employee {{in the course of his}} duties. In Givhan, ruling on the issue of an English teacher voicing concerns to the principal about the school’s racist employment practices, the Court did not evaluate whether these concerns were raised in accordance with her job duties. Consequently, “our silence ...demonstrates that the point was immaterial.” Stevens added that it would be senseless for the constitutional protection of same words to be contingent on whether they are uttered as part of one’s job duties; additionally, it would be “perverse” for the Court to essentially create an incentive for employees to bypass their employer-specified channels of resolution and voice their concerns directly to the public.|$|E

2500|$|Zeitgeist {{received}} mixed reviews, {{indicated by}} {{a score of}} 59/100 on Metacritic. Some negative criticism of the album stemmed from the absence of half of the original lineup, with Pitchfork Media's Rob Mitchum suggesting the name was revived for [...] "cash or attention or both." [...] Qs Paul Rees commented that [...] "at least half of Zeitgeist {{is made up of}} grinding songs that amount to riffs, pummelling and little else," [...] and that Zeitgeists emotional range is [...] "limited and wearing", but praised Chamberlin's drumming, stating that he [...] "remains {{one of the most powerful}} drummers in rock." [...] In addition, Modern Drummer proclaimed that the album contains [...] "Chamberlin's greatest drumming ever put to CD." [...] NME gave it a score of five out of ten and said, [...] "It's best treated as a curio in the Smashing Pumpkins' legacy; and for those who grew up on 'Today', '1979' and 'Ava Adore', you're better left with your memories." [...] The A.V. Club gave it a C+ and said that it [...] "ends up sounding like a Corgan career retrospective in B-side form." [...] musicOMH gave it a score of two-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "Recounting such thoughts, by this point almost an hour has been spent in the company of a record which stares back at you with the appeal of an ex you'd <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> bumped into." [...] Hot Press gave it a mixed review and said, [...] "The best you can offer is that it’s not a disaster – now do you want to tell Billy or should I?" [...] Robert Christgau simply gave the record a [...] "Dud" [...] rating (...) [...] Slant Magazine gave it a score of two out of five and called it [...] "the Pumpkins' most aggressively metal album to date. But heaps of guitars, vocal overdubs, and ridiculous effects don't mask a lack of inventiveness or even plain ol' quality songwriting." [...] Canadian magazine Now also gave it a score of two stars out of five and called it [...] "no-frills rawk that's been dumbed down for mass consumption." [...] Melodic magazine gave it a score of three stars out of five, calling the album a disappointing return of the band. Tiny Mix Tapes gave it a score of one-and-a-half stars out of five and said that [...] "the mixing problems extend far beyond Corgan's voice. The Band of a Hundred Murderous Guitars has turned into a modern-radio-rock band." ...|$|E
