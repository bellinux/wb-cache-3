25|$|Merozoites {{entering}} muscle cells <b>round</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> form metrocytes and initiate sarcocyst formation. Sarcocysts {{begin as}} unicellular bodies containing a single metrocyte and through asexual multiplication numerous metrocytes accumulate and the sarcocyst increases in size. As the sarcocyst matures, the small, rounded, noninfectious metrocytes {{give rise to}} crescent-shaped bodies called bradyzoites that are infections for the definitive host. Time required for maturation varies with the species and may take 2 months or more.|$|E
25|$|AOL {{has faced}} {{a number of}} {{lawsuits}} over claims {{that it has been}} slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and <b>round</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.|$|E

2500|$|On September 28, 1941, {{the last}} day of the season, the Boston Red Sox played a doubleheader at Shibe Park. The day before, Boston manager Joe Cronin gave left fielder Ted Williams the option of sitting out the final two games, because his [...]3995 average would <b>round</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> [...]400. Williams walked the streets of Philadelphia that night, pondering; he decided the stat would be cheapened if he did sit out, so he played and went 6-for-8. His [...]406 average for 1941 was the last [...]400-plus average in the major leagues.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a casino}} {{blackjack}} table, the dealer faces {{five to seven}} playing positions from behind a semicircular table. Between one and eight standard 52-card decks are shuffled together. At {{the beginning of each}} <b>round,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> three players can place their bets in the [...] "betting box" [...] at each position in play. That is, there could be up to three players at each position at a table in jurisdictions that allow back betting. The player whose bet is {{at the front of the}} betting box is deemed to have control over the position, and the dealer will consult the controlling player for playing decisions regarding the hand; the other players of that box are said to [...] "play behind". Any player is usually allowed to control or bet in as many boxes as desired at a single table, but it is prohibited for an individual to play on more than one table at a time or to place multiple bets within a single box. In many U.S. casinos, however, players are limited to playing two or three positions at a table and often only one person is allowed to bet on each position.|$|E

6000|$|The {{problem of}} {{education}} {{might have seemed}} the very simplest.

The triumphant North in America was the land of the common school. The victory of Prussians over Austrians at Sadowa in 1866 was called the victory of the elementary school teacher. Even the nonconformists had come <b>round.</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> the middle of the sixties opinion among them was hostile to the intervention of the state in education. They had resisted Graham’s proposals in 1843, and Lord John Russell’s in 1847; but a younger generation, eager for progress, saw the new necessity that change of social and political circumstance imposed. The business in 1870 was to provide schools, and to get the children into them.(191) ...|$|E
