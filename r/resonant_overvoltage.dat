40|$|The {{study of}} the origin of {{conditions}} and possible consequences of abnormal modes power electrical networks with extreme values parameters, such as overvoltage, traditionally performed using mathematical models with linear and symmetrical elements. This is due to great experience in the development and use of this class of models on practice, since the basis for decision-making in the design and operation of electrical networks is simulation of results primarily in normal modes. At the same time, a more detailed analysis shows that the presence in modern electrical networks sources of distortion, mainly unbalance, influences the current values of the parameters modes, including the probability of transition of these values through thresholds. Trends of modern electricity power grid point to the growing role of extra high voltage (EHV) transmission lines as those that constitute the system and interconnect systems. It {{should be noted that the}} study of overvoltage for this class lines must be done very carefully, particularly with regard to the impact of sources of distortion. This is due to the lack of practical operational reserve insulation, designed for extreme values, as a such reserve for EHV is expensive. Thus, analysis of the possibility of overvoltage in EHV lines should be done not only for normal, but also for abnormal asymmetrical modes. In main electric power networks are used, above all, structural measures to reduce and suppress the <b>resonant</b> <b>overvoltage</b> associated with changes in workload schemes and the transition from an abnormal to normal mode. However, special devices or setting modes by the criterion of reducing the overvoltage can be used when needed, which have been established for other purposes. At the same time the <b>resonant</b> <b>overvoltage</b> caused by current resonance, resulting in influence on the kind of overvoltage is possible by changing the parameters of elements connected in parallel to overhead line. These include, in particular: the neutral inductance and shunt reactors. In this case, the criterion of the occurrence of resonance overvoltage is the length of the line at which the condition of complete current resonance is performed. ? ??????????? ????????????? ????????????? ????? ????????????, ?????? ?????, ??????????? ???? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????????? ??????????????, ????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ????? ? ???????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ? ???????????. ?? ??? ????????????? ????? ???? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??? ????????? ?????? ?? ???????? ?????????? ??????????????, ??????? ???? ??????????? ??? ?????? ?????. ? ?? ?? ????? ??????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ?????, ? ?????????? ???? ??????? ?? ??? ?????????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????, ???????????? ??????????? ????????? ?????. ? ???, ? ?????????, ?????????: ????????????? ???????????????? ? ???????????? ????????. ? ?????? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ???????? ??????????? ????? ?????, ??? ??????? ????????? ??????????? ??????? ????????? ????...|$|E
40|$|Transformer {{terminal}} equivalents obtained via admittance {{measurements are}} suitable for simulating high-frequency transient interaction between the transformer and the network. This paper augments the terminal equivalent approach with a measurement-based voltage transfer function model which permits calculation of voltages at internal points in the regulating winding. The approach is demonstrated for a single-phase three-winding transformer in tap position Nom+ with inclusion of three internal points in the regulating winding that represent the mid-point and the two extreme ends. The terminal equivalent modeling makes use of additional common-mode measurements to avoid error magnifications to result from the ungrounded tertiary winding. The final model is used in a time domain simulation where ground-fault initiation results in a resonant voltage build-up in the winding. It is shown that that the peak value of the <b>resonant</b> <b>overvoltage</b> can be higher than during the lightning impulse test, with unfavorable network conditions. Additional measurements show that the selected tap position affects the terminal behavior of the transformer, changing the frequency and peak value of the lower resonance point in the voltage transfer between windings.

40|$|Ideally, it is {{desirable}} to design and manufacture a transformer winding that can render all its internal resonances non-excitable. This study examines the effectiveness of an interleaved winding in achieving this goal. While investigating its effectiveness, {{it led to the}} establishment of a much desired theoretical basis that reinforces the reasons put forward in the literature to explain internal insulation failures observed in interleaved windings used in extra high voltage (EHV) transformers. Numerical calculations along with experimental verification on actual transformer windings are presented. This study reveals that most of the natural frequencies that are normally non-excitable in the line and neutral current responses of an interleaved winding have been rendered excitable in the disk-to-disk voltages, thus, providing favourable conditions for insulation overstress because of <b>resonant</b> <b>overvoltages.</b> Prevalence of such a condition is an inherent characteristic of interleaved windings...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a reliable, {{versatile}} and rigorous method for {{high frequency power}} transformer modeling is searched and established. The purpose is to apply this model to sensitivity analysis of FRA (Frequency Response Analysis) which is a quite new diagnostic method for assessing the mechanical integrity of power transformer windings on-site. The method should be versatile {{in terms of being}} able to estimate internal and external overvoltages and resonances. Another important aspect is that the method chosen is suitable for real transformer geometries. In order to verify the suitability of the model for real transformers, a specific test-object is used. This is a 20 MVA transformer, and details are given in chapter 1. 4. The high frequency power transformer model is established from geometrical and constructional information from the manufacturer, together with available material characteristics. All circuit parameters in the lumped circuit representation is calculated based on these data. No empirical modifications need to be performed. Comparison shows capability of reasonable accuracy in the range from 10 kHz to 1 MHz utilizing a disc-to-disc representation. A compromise between accuracy of model due to discretisation and complexity of the model in a turn-to-turn representation is inevitable. The importance of the iron core is emphasized through a comparison of representations with/without the core included. Frequency-dependent phenomena are accurately represented using an isotropic equivalent for windings and core, even with a coarse mesh for the FEM-model. This is achieved through a frequency-dependent complex permeability representation of the materials. This permeability is deduced from an analytical solution of the frequency-dependent magnetic field inside the conductors and the core. The importance of dielectric losses in a transformer model is also assessed. Since published data on the high frequency properties of pressboard are limited, some initial measurements are done on impregnated pressboard at different temperatures and moisture-levels. Tanδ is found to be twice the corresponding value for impregnated paper at frequencies from 50 kHz to 1 MHz. Moisture has a minor effect on the losses when frequency approaches 1 MHz. Service-aged paper (impregnated) is also tested in order to investigate other ageing-effects than produced water, but the test show the same decreasing influence at higher frequencies as impregnated pressboard with moisture added. The following main conclusions were drawn from this work: • A simple, analytical approach cannot be used to build a versatile high frequency power transformer model. The reason being mainly the lack of a proper representation of the iron core, since a FEM-representation without the core did not increase coherence to measurements significantly. • A proper representation of the iron core is very important for the calculation of inductances. Losses mainly originate from the core at intermediate frequencies (10 - 200 kHz), and not only from eddy currents in the windings as traditionally assumed. The permeability seem to be of less importance {{as long as it is}} well above permeability for oil, since the internal resonances mainly depends on the leakage inductances. The core leg equivalent is important for the leakage field and determines the leakage inductances and winding losses. • Using a frequency-dependent complex permeability in a FEM-simulation makes possible an accurate representation of core and windings using a coarse mesh. If coating resistivity is sufficiently low to create interlaminar currents/ losses, the iron laminates should be represented by a 2 -dimensional complex permeability. Coating parameters are seldom available. • Dielectric properties of power transformer insulating materials depend on frequency, temperature, moisture, ageing and pressure. Temperature has minor influence on FRA-signatures, other parameters have practically no influence. • Impulse- and <b>resonant</b> <b>overvoltages</b> both internally and on terminals can be analysed using this method with sufficient accuracy, provided the discretisation of the winding is sufficiently refined regarding the frequencies involved. Since terminal behaviour is given by the internal geometry and material parameters, it is assumed that internal behaviour is related to the accuracy of the terminal behaviour. • FRA sensitivity to axial displacement is 1. 2 % of total axial height. The sensitivity to radial deformation (forced buckling) is found to be a buckling depth of 9 % of the radius of the winding. Turn-to-turn short-circuits could not be modeled correctly since the lumped elements includes several turns. Disc-todisc short circuits are easily detected. Axial bending is not detectable. Detection of loose windings and aged insulation is improbable and will be dependent on the available sensitivity (mainly related to the repeatability of the measurements and the reference utilized for comparison). The contributions in this work relates to different topics such as; Frequency-dependent iron core representation in FEM, study of interlaminar currents and its effect on the internal magnetic field, characterization of high frequency dielectric properties of impregnated pressboard and service-aged impregnated paper, procedure for evaluation of internal/external overvoltages, and finally sensitivity guidelines for the application of FRA to mechanical deformations. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
