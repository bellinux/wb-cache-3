5000|$|Chiles: peppers of the Capsicum genus. The New Mexico chile {{is a local}} {{cultivar}} of the species, or subspecies of C. annuum. It is visually and genetically {{similar to}} Anaheim peppers, but usually hotter with a different flavor and texture. The large, flavorful New Mexican variety gives the regions cuisine much of its distinctive style, and used so extensively that it is known simply as [...] "chile". Green chiles {{are those that are}} picked unripe; they are fire-roasted, then peeled before further use. Unlike the ultra-mild canned supermarket green chiles, New Mexico green chiles can range from mild to hotter than jalapeños, and come in grades of spiciness at markets that cater to chile aficionados. The climate of New Mexico tends to increase the capsaicin levels in the chile compared to other areas. Red chiles are the ripe form of the same plant (though particular strains are bred for intended use as <b>red</b> or green <b>chile).</b> Generally more piquant than green chiles, they too can be roasted, but are usually dried; they can be added whole, to spice an entire stew, or more often are ground into powder or sometimes flakes. Freshly dried <b>red</b> <b>chiles</b> are sold in string-bound bundles called ristras, which are a common decorative sight on porches and in homes and businesses throughout the Southwest. Chiles may be referred to as chile peppers, especially if the sentence requires them to be distinguished from the chile sauce made from them. The bulk of, and allegedly the best of, New Mexico chiles are grown in and around Hatch, in southern New Mexico. Chimayo in northern New Mexico is also well known for its chile peppers.|$|R
