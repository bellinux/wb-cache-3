60|$|This {{generalization}} {{may appear}} to some minds not to amount to much, since after all it asserts only this: “it is a law, that every event depends on some law:” “it is a law, {{that there is a}} law for every thing.” We must not, however, conclude that the generality of the principle is merely verbal; it will be found on inspection to be no vague or unmeaning assertion, but a most important and <b>really</b> <b>fundamental</b> truth.|$|E
60|$|I do not {{see that}} lying is a {{fundamental}} sin. In the first place some lying, {{that is to say}} some unavoidable inaccuracy of statement, is necessary to nearly everything we do, and the truest statement becomes false if we forget or alter the angle at which it is made, the direction in which it points. In the next the <b>really</b> <b>fundamental</b> and most generalized sin is self-isolation. Lying is a sin only because self-isolation is a sin, because it is an effectual way of cutting oneself off from human co-operation. That is why there is no sin in telling a fairy tale to a child. But telling the truth when it will be misunderstood is no whit better than lying; silences are often blacker than any lies. I class secrets with lies and cannot comprehend the moral standards that exonerate secrecy in human affairs.|$|E

60|$|But even a more {{important}} fact about the text is, that it tells us what were <b>really</b> the <b>fundamental</b> doctrines of the Christian religion in those early times, about twenty-five years, seemingly, after our Lord's death; what St. Paul used to preach about; what he considered {{was the first thing}} which he had to tell men.|$|R
25|$|However, {{more recent}} {{biological}} analyses, such as Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, have contended that Morgan's Canon {{is not the}} simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this is <b>really</b> the <b>fundamental</b> underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as emergent features of evolution.|$|R
60|$|Now, in each {{of these}} groups the {{resemblance}} in structure among the members of the group is closer in proportion as the group is smaller. Thus, a man and a worm are members of the animal kingdom in virtue of certain apparently slight though <b>really</b> <b>fundamental</b> resemblances which they present. But a man and a fish are members of the same sub-kingdom Vertebrata, because they are much more like one another than either of them is to a worm, or a snail, or any member of the other sub-kingdoms. For similar reasons men and horses are arranged as members of the same Class, Mammalia; men and apes as members of the same Order, Primates; and if there were any animals more like men than they were like any of the apes, and yet different from men in important and constant particulars of their organisation, we should rank them as members of the same Family, or of the same Genus, but as of distinct Species.|$|E
6000|$|The third great {{issue about}} {{which there is}} nothing but fog and {{uncertainty}} is the so-called [...] "War After the War," [...] {{the idea of a}} permanent economic alliance to prevent the economic recuperation of Germany. Upon that idea German imperialism, in its frantic effort to keep its tormented people fighting, naturally puts the utmost stress. The threat of War after the War robs the reasonable German of his last inducement to turn on his Government and insist upon peace. Shut out from all trade, unable to buy food, deprived of raw material, peace would be as bad for Germany as war. He will argue naturally enough and reasonably enough that he may as well die fighting as starve. This is a far more vital issue to him than the Belgian issue or Poland or Alsace-Lorraine. Our statesmen waste their breath and slight our intelligence when these foreground questions are thrust in front of the <b>really</b> <b>fundamental</b> matters. But as the mass of sensible people in every country concerned, in Germany just as much as in France or Great Britain, know perfectly well, unimpeded trade is good for every one except a few rich adventurers, and restricted trade destroys limitless wealth and welfare for mankind to make a few private fortunes or secure an advantage for some imperialist clique. We want an end to this economic strategy, we want an end to this plotting of Governmental cliques against the general welfare. In such offences Germany has been the chief of sinners, but which among the belligerent nations can throw the first stone? Here again the way to the world's peace, the only way to enduring peace, lies through internationalism, through an international survey of commercial treaties, through an international control of inter-State shipping and transport rates. Unless the Allied statesmen fail to understand the implications of their own general professions they mean that. But why do they not say it plainly? Why do they not shout it so compactly and loudly that all Germany will hear and understand? Why do they justify imperialism to Germany? Why do they maintain a threatening ambiguity towards Germany on all these matters? ...|$|E

This [...] "polarity" [...] can then be used to define the conic, {{in a manner that is}} perfectly symmetrical and immediately self-dual: a conic is simply the locus of points which lie on their polars, or the envelope of lines which pass through their poles. Von Staudt’s treatment of quadrics is analogous, in three dimensions.|$|R

Instead of treating first the comparatively difficult and unfamiliar details of variation, I commence with the Struggle for Existence, which is <b>really</b> the <b>fundamental</b> phenomenon on which natural selection depends, while the particular facts which illustrate it are comparatively familiar and very interesting. It has the further advantage that, after discussing variation and the effects of artificial selection, we proceed at once to explain how natural selection acts.|$|R

He developed the integrated information theory (IIT): a scientific theory of what consciousness is, how it can be measured, how it is correlated with brain states, and why it fades when we fall into dreamless sleep and returns when we dream. The theory is being tested with neuroimaging, TMS, and computer models. His work has been described as [...] "the only <b>really</b> promising <b>fundamental</b> theory of consciousness" [...] by collaborator Christof Koch.|$|R
60|$|These three {{laws are}} samples of self-evident logical principles, {{but are not}} <b>really</b> more <b>fundamental</b> or more self-evident than various other similar principles: for instance, the one we {{considered}} just now, which states that what follows from a true premiss is true. The name 'laws of thought' is also misleading, for {{what is important is}} not the fact that we think in accordance with these laws, but the fact that things behave in accordance with them; in other words, the fact that when we think in accordance with them we think truly.

You take large product and merge them together into the biggest possible nucleus. So if you took San Diego and Los Angeles together and merged them into one mega-city, that's even bigger and more memorable than the two cities independently... It is hard for people to remember more than 5 or 10 products from a particular company. If we can take each of the products we have and make them even larger and more meaningful to people, I think there’s a lot of benefit that could be had by both the users, because they don’t have to remember quite as much.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} organisations and {{individuals}} have criticised {{aspects of the}} 'Green Economy', particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using price mechanisms to protect nature, arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water. The research organisation ETC Group argues that the corporate emphasis on bio-economy [...] "will spur even greater convergence of corporate power and unleash the most massive resource grab in more than 500 years." [...] Venezuelan professor Edgardo Lander says that the UNEP's report, Towards a Green Economy, while well-intentioned [...] "ignores {{the fact that the}} capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets - even when a large majority of the population call for them - is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations."

40|$|Introduction Ever {{since the}} notion of type was {{introduced}} in computer science, there have been people claiming that Type (the collection of all types) should be a type, and hence {{be a member of}} itself. This was intended to permit computations yielding types as results, and {{it seemed to be a}} straightforward extension of the (otherwise) successful principle that, in programming languages, one should be able to operate uniformly on every entity in the domain of discourse. The notion of Type being a type (written Type:Type) is however in apparent contrast with the requirements of static typechecking, philosophically dubious, and often (when formalized) mathematically inconsistent. All the existing programming languages with Type:Type have been designed on shaky grounds, and built without much investigation of the <b>really</b> <b>fundamental</b> difficulties that have to be resolved.

Thus allowing for extra readability over the source code and reasonability capabilities over the represented structures. ComponentJ is a component-oriented language in an object-oriented sense. Components are instantiated into objects that provide services which are interface typed references {{in the sense of the}} common class-based languages. Aggregates of instances based on object cross-referencing are a common programming pattern in object-oriented languages, and are used where inheritance is no longer a natural extension mechanism.

40|$|There are {{two very}} {{important}} subjects in physics: Symmetry of dynamical models and nonlinearity. All <b>really</b> <b>fundamental</b> models are invariant under some particular symmetry groups. There is also no true physics, no our Universe and life at all, without nonlinearity. Particularly interesting are essential, non-perturbative nonlinearities which are not described by correction terms imposed on some well-defined linear background. Our idea in this paper is that there exists some mysterious, not yet understood link between essential, physically relevant nonlinearity and dynamical symmetry, first of all, large symmetry groups. In some sense the problem is known even in soliton theory, where the essential nonlinearity is often accompanied by the infinite system of integrals of motion, thus, by infinite-dimensional symmetry groups. Here we discuss some more familiar problems {{from the realm of}} field theory, condensed matter physics, and analytical mechanics, where the link between essential nonlinearity and high symmetry is obvious, even if not yet fully understood.
