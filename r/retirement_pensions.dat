5|$|De la Rúa's first Minister of Economy was the progressivist José Luis Machinea, who was {{proposed}} by Alfonsín and Álvarez. Menem {{had left a}} deficit of 5 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) points that Machinea tried to compensate with higher taxes to people with the highest incomes, and a reduction of the highest <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions.</b> The deficit was reduced but the crisis continued. The scandal over the labor law and the resignation of Álvarez increased the country risk, and made Argentina's access to international credit more difficult. The government negotiated a US$38 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) line of credit to prevent a default and allow the economy to grow again. Machinea also proposed to appoint the former minister Cavallo as {{the new president of}} the Central Bank of Argentina. However, Machinea was unable to achieve the levels of austerity negotiated with the IMF and resigned a few days later. The Minister of Defense Ricardo López Murphy became the new Minister of Economy. During the election camapain, De la Rúa had promised not to appoint him to that ministry, but with the ongoing crisis {{he did not want to}} risk problems caused by a temporary lack of minister. López Murphy announced a stricter austerity plan, with reduction to the health and education budgets. His plan was rejected by street demonstrations and the Frepaso, so De la Rúa declined it. Murphy resigned after being minister for 16 days.|$|E

School district leaders have noted the change to retirement pension requirements have been a blessing, saying the separation allows school districts to spend more on school operations.

25|$|Substantial {{increases}} {{were made}} in social security benefits such as injury and sickness benefits, pensions, unemployment benefits, housing allowances, basic subsistence aid allowances, and family allowances and living allowances. In the government's first budget, sickness benefits were increased by 9.3%, pensions for war widows by 25%, pensions for the war wounded by 16%, and <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions</b> by 5%. Numerically, pensions went up by 6.4% (1970), 5.5% (1971), 9.5% (1972), 11.4% (1973), and 11.2% (1974). Adjusted {{for changes in the}} annual price index, pensions went up in real terms by 3.1% (1970), 0.3% (1971), 3.9% (1972), 4.4% (1973), and 4.2% (1974). Between 1972 and 1974, the purchasing power of pensioners went up by 19%. In 1970, war pensions were increased by 16%. War victim’s pensions went up by 5.5% in January 1971, and by 6.3% in January 1972. By 1972, war pensions for orphans and parents had gone up by around 40%, and for widows by around 50%. Between 1970 and 1972, the “Landabgaberente” (land transfer pension) went up by 55%. Between 1969 and 1974, the average real standard rate of income support rose (in 1991 prices) from around 300 DM to around 400 DM. Between 1970 and 1974, unemployment benefits rose from around 300 euros to around 400 euros per month, and unemployment assistance from just under 200 euros per month to just under 400 euros per month. In 2001 prices, the average standard social assistance benefit level rose from around 200 euros per month in 1969 to over 250 euros per month in 1974. During most of Brandt’s years as chancellor, the majority of benefits increased as a percentage of average net earnings.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} program of 1935, {{and perhaps the}} New Deal as a whole, was the Social Security Act, drafted by Frances Perkins.

2500|$|Based on Bismarck's message, the Reichstag filed three {{bills to}} deal with the {{concepts}} of accident and sickness insurance. The subjects of <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions</b> and disability insurance were placed on the back-burner for the time being. The social legislation implemented by Bismarck in the 1880s {{played a key role in}} the sharp, rapid decline of German emigration to America. Young men considering emigration looked at not only the gap between higher hourly [...] "direct wages" [...] in the United States and Germany but also the differential in [...] "indirect wages", social benefits, which favored staying in Germany. The young men went to German industrial cities, so that Bismarck's insurance system partly offset low wage rates in Germany and further reduced the emigration rate.|$|E

We contend that justice is comprised of three core principles: need, which legitimates the social minimum {{that is necessary to}} sustain an adequate standard of living for the least advantaged; desert, which provides a justification for allocating income in accordance with differentials in work participation prior to retirement; and equality, which provides a normative rationale for universal citizenship entitlements.

2500|$|On [...] December 14, 1889, Shepard {{was named}} to the {{position}} of Chief of the Revenue Marine Division. Although the Revenue Marine Bureau existed prior to the appointment, the command of the bureau belonged to the Chief of Customs Collectors, and as such Captain Leonard G. Shepard became Chief of the [...] "Revenue Marine Division" [...] and is considered to be the first Commandant. He immediately began a campaign of reform and petitioned for funds for new cutters and a plan for officer <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions.</b> His plan was to quit spending money on repair of older vessels that did not meet modern needs of the service and acquire new vessels that served more efficiently. The officer situation was one of many officers serving well into their eighties, thus hindering younger officers chances of promotion. This affected the morale of the service considerably and kept many able young men from joining the service. The senior officers stayed on in command {{because of a lack of}} a retirement pension. Shepard closed the Revenue Cutter School at Fort Trumbull, Connecticut soon after assuming the office of Chief of the Revenue Cutter Division to dramatize the lack promotion opportunities and the last class of Cadets graduated in May 1890. He also fought for the passage of HR 6723; a bill that created a medical review board that examined senior officers and eliminated those not fit to command.|$|E

[...] The city and RCT were far apart on a purchase price for RCT's buses, and negotiations were not bringing them significantly closer. [...] On November 19, RCT President Charles C. Bowen offered to allow the city to take immediate possession of the transit system if they agreed to continue the current litigation and abide by whatever the courts ultimately decided, on both {{the question of whether the}} franchise termination had been legal and on determining the fair value of the assets involved, for compensation to RCT and Landport Inc.

2500|$|These were {{unfavorable}} to women, {{although they}} have been reformed in the 21st century. The regimes have been criticized as positioning widows as mere custodians of property for children, rather than legitimate property owners. Indeed, studies show that a woman's ability to exercise her right to inherited property is largely influenced by whether she {{is viewed as a}} potential agriculturalist. Women are often denied access to inherited property because they do not inherit from their fathers and are not recognized as worthy heads of productive units. Though consensual unions were recognized by the 1988 Constitution, women in consensual unions were not endowed with the same inheritance rights as married women until 1994. With the return to civilian rule in 1985, President José Sarney made the more equitable distribution of land one of his attested objectives, issuing a directive to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform and Land Development in 1986 urging that beneficiaries of land be chose [...] "independently of sex." [...] In conjunction with the democratic opening of the 1980s, a rural women's movement emerged with calls for inclusion of women in rural unions and guarantee of social security benefits, such as paid maternity leave and <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions,</b> for rural women. The National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG), which is the largest organization of agricultural workers in Brazil, tackled women's rights for the first time during its fourth congress in 1985, when it decided to extend membership to more women and actively work to end gender discrimination. Demands for more equitable agrarian property rights, championed by organizations such as the Central Workers' Union, the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Women's Council led to agrarian reform measures in the 1988 Constitution. Grievances regarding equal land distribution in Brazil continued, evident in the Marcha da Margaridas of 2000, in which over fifteen thousand women marched on the capital to demand joint allocation of land to couples, rather than just men.The 2003 Civil Code improved women's rights, providing for gender equality in the acquisition, management, and administration of property brought into the ...|$|E
