40|$|Rainfall-runoff models require {{rainfall}} and runoff data {{for determining the}} model parameters. Problem usually emerges in finding the optimal model parameters {{due to lack of}} rainfall data in terms of quantity and quality. In a lumped model such as the storage function model, good quality and quantity of input （rainfall） data that represent the catchment behavior is needed {{in order to get the}} optimum model parameters. However, it is difficult to get the rainfall data that fulfill the requirement as results of high spatial variability of rainfall data and lack of automatic <b>rainfall</b> <b>recorder</b> that are commonly found in tropical regions. To overcome the above problem, the filter separation autoregressive model might be used to estimate the rainfall time series based on runoff data only. The resulted rainfall together with the runoff data are then used to find the storage function model parameters. The results show that the inversely estimated rainfall was useful for estimating the rainfall－runoff model parameters in topical regions...|$|E

40|$|Rainfall {{data for}} the Netherlands {{have been used in}} this study to {{investigate}} aspects of heterogeneity of rainfall, in particular local differences in rainfall levels, time trends in rainfall, and local differences in rainfall trend. The possible effect of urbanization and industrialization on the distribution of rainfall has also been studied. Consideration has been given to whether local differences in rainfall justify a partition of the Netherlands into regions. Finally, the degree of areal reduction which is possible in hydrological design because of variation of rainfall in time and space has been investigated. A statistical analysis of these aspects is useful because they frequently appear in the hydrological literature. The statistical analysis presented in this thesis uses hydrological concepts, such as the statistical areal reduction factor, and attention is focused on moderately low return period events. Only rainfall levels and trends in rainfall have been investigated and not more complicated aspects, such as, trends in the variance of rainfall. Further, rainfall variations in time and space have been analysed separately. Estimates of the levels of the rainfall characteristics used in the investigation of homogeneity in time and space are given in Section 2. 2. These are annual frequencies of exceedance during the summer or the winter period of a certain threshold value and the total annual rainfall (Tables 2. 1 and 2. 2). The expected daily rainfall has also been estimated for return periods in excess of half a year (Table 2. 4, Figure 2. 2). Time trends in rainfall averaged over the Netherlands have been estimated. For the period 1951 - 1979, the time trend is negative for the summer period; and for the period 1906 - 1979, the time trend is positive for the winter period (Table 2. 5). Time trends in rainfall series were found {{to be related to the}} occurrence of circulation types (Figure 2. 4). In Section 2. 4 local differences in these rainfall characteristics have been investigated using the kriging method that gives thebest linear unbiased predictor. As may be expected, there are local differences, both in rainfall level (Figure 2. 7), and in time trends in the rainfall series which were reduced by the annual mean (Figure 2. 9). Many of the rainfall series investigated exhibit inhomogeneities (Table 2. 7). Two possible causes of these inhomogeneities, changes in the frequency of occurrence of circulation types and anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization and industrialization, are discussed in Section 2. 6. A possible partition of the Netherlands into regions is investigated by using rainfall {{data for the}} period 1951 - 1979. Earlier studies on the geographical distribution of certain rainfall characteristics in the Netherlands are presented in Section 2. 5. 1. The model to test the statistical significance of the partitions used in this study is presented in Section 2. 5. 2. One of the proposed partitions, an a posteriori partition based on mean annual rainfall (Figure 2. 11 D), is in agreement with the resulting spatial patterns of the levels of the rainfall characteristics considered (Table 2. 10). Also, the level of hourly rainfall was found to be related to mean annual rainfall (Figure 2. 18 A), but, with a simple urban runoff model with a time-step of one hour, no differences were found between the number and quantity of overflow for 12 rainfall stations, classified according to this partition (Section 2. 5. 3). These partitions into regions are not satisfactory for rainfall trends, except for an a posteriori partition based on time trends for the period 1951 - 1979 (Figure 2. 12). But both the geographical distribution of trends and the degree of trend in some long-term rainfall records are not in agreement with this partition. Apparently, the changes in rainfall pattern are recent. Because the partition is based on trends in reduced rainfall series (reduced by the annual mean), the changes are also local. Thus on the basis of data used in this study, it was not possible to devise a satisfactory partition of the Netherlands for rainfall trends. With regard to rainfall level it is suffice to assume that the design rainfall at a given location is proportionate to the mean summer or winter rainfall; therefore, a partition of the Netherlands into regions is not necessary. This has already been suggested in Buishand and Velds (1980). The influence of urbanization and industrialization on precipitation (urban effects) has been investigated by using the method of Lowry (1977), which allows for changes in frequency of occurrence of circulation types. In Section 2. 6, this method is discussed and the findings of other studies on the occurrence, causes, and magnitude of urban effects are presented. In Section 2. 6. 1, the occurrence of urban effects is discussed, for instance, on the basis of changes in mean daily rainfall for 32 rainfall stations between the industrialized and urbanized period (1956 - 1979) and the non-industrialized period (1932 - 1955), with a stratification of days according to season and circulation type (according to Hess, 1977), see Figure 2. 22. Although the results were sometimes inconclusive and not always in. accordance with the hypothesis of an urban effect, there are indications of urban effects for the zonal circulation type and for three of the meridional circulation types (Tables 2. 16 and 2. 17; Figure 2. 22). Moderate rainfalls were also found to be affected (Table 2. 17, where a threshold value for daily rainfall of 15 mm has been considered), and urban effects in the summer period increase with rainfall depth. In Chapter 3 consideration is given to the degree of areal reduction which is possible in hydrological design because. of variations of rainfall in time and space. Use has been made of the IRF- 0 kriging theory, and semi-variograms were estimated by the multi-realization approach. The applicability of the IRF- 0 theory to predict the mean areal rainfall is discussed in section 3. 2. 1. Contrary to what had been expected, in a substantial number of cases the estimated order of the intrinsic random function differs from zero (Tabel 3. 1). Further research is needed on the structure identification, both on the statistical aspects (estimation of the order k of the intrinsic random function and of the coefficients of the generalized covariance model) and on the physical aspects (semi-variogram or generalized covariance model to be expected under certain assumptions regarding rainfall). The variation in semi-variogram estimates for individual rainfall events was found to be large (Figure 3. 3). In Section 3. 2. 2, the kriging predictor of areal rainfall is compared with the more commonly used arithmetic mean and Thiessen predictor. All three predictors yield similar results (Table 3. 5), but the kriging predictor is more efficient (Table 3. 4). Methods to estimate the statistical areal reduction factor (ARF) are presented in Section 3. 3. 1. With the methods proposed in USWB (1957 - 1960), NERC (1975), Bell (1976), and Rodríguez-Iturbe and Mejía (1974) and Buishand (1977 c), the areal reduction factor for daily rainfall (ARF 24 ) has been estimated for three areas each of about 1000 km 2 in the Netherlands, for the summer period, the winter period, and the complete year. In Section 3. 3. 3, the variance of ARF 24 is estimated. All four estimators of ARF 24 were found to produce similar results (Tabel 3. 12), and the three areas considered do not clearly differ with respect to ARF 24 . These estimates of ARF 24 are somewhat lower than those of USWB (1957 - 1960) for the United States and those of NERC (1975) for the United Kingdom (Figure 3. 22), and they are in reasonable agreement with earlier estimates of ARF 24 for the Netherlands (Table 3. 14). For small areas, ARF 24 is underestimated by the method which uses the marginal distribution of point rainfall and the fitted correlationdistance function. This is also evidenced by the higher ARF 24 values in Kraijenhoff (1963). ARF 24 depends heavily on season and return period (Table 3. 7). Averaged over the three areas, the maximum areal rainfall occurs in the winter period in 33 % of the years considered. In Section 3. 4 ARF for hourly rainfall (ARF 1 ) is estimated. As a function of areal size and return period, ARF 1 has been estimated for the summer and the winter period (Figure 3. 28) and for the complete year (Figure 3. 21). These ARF 1 estimates are somewhat lower than those of USWB (1957 - 1960) and NERC (1975) (Table 3. 18), probably because few hourly rainfall data were available for this study. Especially the correlation-distance function for hourly rainfalls could not be estimated very satisfactorily. The storm-centred areal reduction factor (SRF) is discussed in Section 3. 5. Models for SRF based on a literature survey of minimum-rainfall curves are presented in Table 3. 19. For equal areal size, SRF values from network data are generally lower than ARF values (Figure 3. 29). The smaller the areal size and the shorter the period for which rainfall totals are considered, the closer SRF and ARF values. In this study, rainfall variations in time and space have been analysed separately. Because of this simplification of the problem, the results presented in Chapter 3 may be of less relevance to practical design issues related to areal rainfall. Areal reduction is partly caused by spatial differences in rainfall patterns in time. This aspect of areal reduction is not taken into account, when time aggregates of rainfall over a measurement interval are considered, and rainfall depths over consecutive intervals are assumed to be independent. For this reason, the degree of areal reduction applicable to regional transport systems of sewerage water cannot be determined by using the statistical areal reduction factor. When rainfall variations in time and space are analysed as being interdependent, the need for knowledge and understanding of meteorology increases because the rainfall events described have first to be classified. Further, instead of the univariate statistical methods as used almost exclusively in this study, multivariate methods are required. However, at present, data from a dense network of <b>rainfall</b> <b>recorders,</b> necessary for such an investigation, are not available for the Netherlands. Further research on the causes of homogeneities in rainfall series is necessary. Although this study of homogeneity has been restricted to rainfall records of good and even quality, many rainfall series are statistically inhomogeneous, and local differences in trend often seem inexplicable. To explain this, meteorological knowledge and knowledge of the station history of rainfall series used is essential...|$|R

In this research, a flood {{early warning system}} made, an automatic <b>rainfall</b> <b>recorder</b> (ARR) was placed in upstream of Garang River and an automatic water level recorder (AWLR) placed in Simongan weir. To receive rainfall and water level data, a computer as server placed in Semarang government office. This functions for sending flood status (prepared/caution/careful) to flood attendants, stake holders. Artificial neural network (ANN) used to predict water level where the input are rainfall in upstream river for 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 days before and the water level in the downstream for 3 hours before the occasion. The output water level in downstream for next 2 hours. This system integrated with information technology that is SMS (Short Message Services) and Web that the flood early warning can be accessed anywhere as long as communication network is available. The result shows time for sending data of rainfall and water level telemetry system less than 10 minutes, while information system built to give flood early warning information less than 10 minutes.

40|$|Advances in {{scientific}} understanding follow a cyclic pattern where new observational techniques lead to novel theoretical insight. From novel theories, in turn, hypotheses are derived that cannot be tested using current observations and thus create {{a demand for}} even newer observational techniques. Hydrology has recently experienced a period of great advances in theoretical understanding with hydrological models gaining considerably in complexity. Currently, {{the state of the}} hydrological science is at a point where further increases in complexity of hydrological models can no longer be supported by available data. The information content of currently used data is too low to uniquely identify the numerous parameters in hydrological models. Therefore new, and above all, different observational methods are needed to unlock thus far hidden hydrological data. In this thesis it is argued that three developments can be greatly beneficial to help hydrologists unlock new data:  The occurrence of sensors in nearly every (consumer) device and the associated drop in the cost of those sensors  The rise of the “open source hardware” movement, which promotes sharing hardware designs.  The online sharing of research results and large data sets To be able to use these developments successfully in hydrology, pragmatic researchers are needed. Scientists whom, using a “MacGyver” attitude towards science, can show proof-of-concept results of how these new developments can best benefit hydrology. In this thesis, four such proof of concepts are presented, summarised below. Using the Wiimote as a sensor in water research An example of how consumer electronics can be used for hydrology is given in chapter 2. The $ 40 “Wiimote” (an input device belonging with the Nintendo® Wiigame system) is a device that contains three accelerometers and an infrared camera with built-in source tracking. It communicates by Bluetooth®. Because of the efforts of the hacking community it is easy to let the Wiimote communicate with a standard personal computer. Using a floating evaporation pan as an example, it is shown that the Wiimote, although it may have potential drawbacks when used in field campaigns, is a good addition to the hydrologist’s bag of tools. This first proof-of-concept work can inspire other scientists to consider using consumer electronics based sensors in their work. A resonating <b>rainfall</b> and evaporation <b>recorder</b> In chapter 3 a novel method of measuring rainfall and evaporation is presented. The device is basically a collection vessel (bucket) placed on top of a slender rod that is securely fixed at its base. As the vessel is deflected, either by manual perturbation or ambient forcing (for example, wind), its oscillatory response is measured by a miniature accelerometer. This response can be modeled as a damped massspring system. As the mass of water within the collection vessel changes, through either the addition of precipitation or by evaporative loss, the resonant frequency experiences an inverse shift. This shift can be measured and used to estimate the change in mass of water. This concept was tested by creating a simple prototype which was used in field conditions for a period of one month. The instrument was able to detect changes in mass due to precipitation with an accuracy of approximately 1 mm. Design, calibration and field evaluation of an acoustic disdrometer designed for distributed measurements Another novel raingauge is presented in chapter 4. The “Delft-disdrometer” is an acoustic disdrometer: a raingauge that measures the size of individual raindrops by recording the sound that impacting raindrops make when they hit the sensor. The Delft-disdrometer is specifically designed to be low maintenance, thus allowing the installation of dense networks without incurring large upkeep costs. In a field evaluation, the Delft-disdrometer was compared to existing rain gauges and disdrometers. Results show that the Delft-disdrometer is capable of measuring precipitation intensities with comparable uncertainties as those of the industry standard Thies LPM and Ott Parsivel. For drops bigger than 1. 75 mm, the Delft-disdrometer measured drop size distributions similar to the drop size distributions measured by the Thies LPM and Ott Parsivel. The inability of the Delft-disdrometers to measure drops smaller than 1 mm is an issue that should be addressed in future iterations of the design. The experiments with this first prototype show that it is feasible to measure precipitation intensities with the low maintenance Delft-disdrometer. Medicinal Footprint {{of the population of the}} Rhine basin The final example is given in chapter 5. By using freely available demographic data the relation between pharmaceutical residues along the river Rhine and the demographic characteristics of the upstream population was studied. A sampling campaign was performed in which water samples from the Rhine taken at 42 locations. Measurements were compared to a two parameter model with regional demographic data as main input. For 12 out of the 21 studied pharmaceuticals, a significant dominant demographic group could be identified. For 3 out of these 12 pharmaceuticals male elderly were the most contributing demographic group. A Monte Carlo analysis showed a high level of significance for the results of this study (? < 0. 01). By combining environmental water quality data and demographic data, better insight was gained in the interplay between humans and their environment, showing the medicinal footprint of the population of the Rhine basin. Conclusions and look into the future In the ongoing cycle between new observational methods and new theories, hydrology is due for a round of new observational methods. Because of the complexity of current day hydrological models, richer datasets are needed to test the predictions (hypotheses) that those complex models make. More spatially distributed measurements of well known hydrological variables, as well as novel measurements of previously thought unmeasurable, or unimportant, variables are needed. Sensors designed for use in consumer electronics are often cheaper than sensors specifically designed for scientific research, because of the economies of scale achieved in the production of consumer electronics. Using these sensors normally required both hydrological insight as well as skills with (micro) electronics. However, the advent of the open hardware movement, spearheaded by the Arduino platform, has significantly lowered the threshold for hydrologist to build their own sensors. And finally: not all new data need to come from sensors: by looking at data sources outside of hydrology, such as the demographic data used in chapter 5, additional hydrological insight can be obtained. However, before the benefits of low cost sensors, open source hardware and open data can be reaped by all hydrologists three steps need to be taken. Work on innovative measurement techniques should be accompanied by step by step instructions on how to recreate the measurement device. Producers of sensors and open source hardware need to provide plug and play functionality. Geoscientific data needs to be stored in standardised formats, whether online or on local files. The work presented in this thesis shows examples of how lower cost sensors based on consumer electronics, open source hardware and open data sources from outside of hydrology can help hydrology move into the next phase of its ever continuing cycle...|$|R
