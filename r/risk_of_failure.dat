5|$|Despite its problems, the {{locomotive}} displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction {{from the two}} power bogies on its trial runs. When properly fired, the Leader was capable of {{keeping up with the}} schedules, even running ahead on occasions. However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never used on a revenue-earning service because of the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> of the valve gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E
5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) increases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> to osseointegration.|$|E
5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E

5|$|The HP.80 and Avro's Type 698 {{were chosen}} as the best two of the {{proposed}} designs to B.35/46, and orders for two prototypes of each were placed. It was recognised, however, {{that there were many}} unknowns associated with both designs, and an order was also placed for Vickers' design, which became the Valiant. Although not fully meeting the requirements of the specification, the Valiant design posed little <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> and could therefore reach service earlier. The HP.80's crescent wing was tested on a ⅓-scale glider, the HP.87, and a heavily modified Supermarine Attacker, which was given the Handley Page HP.88 designation. The HP.88 crashed on 26 August 1951 after completing only about thirty flights and little useful data was gained during its brief two months of existence. By the time the HP.88 was ready, the HP.80 wing had changed such that the former was no longer representative. The design of the HP.80 had sufficiently advanced that the loss of the HP.88 had little effect on the programme.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{original}} vendor {{was no longer}} in business, and a new manufacturer could not be qualified before 2010, when the shuttles were scheduled to be retired, NASA decided to continue operations with the existing tanks. Therefore, to reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> and the cumulative effects of load, the vessels were maintained at 80 percent of the operating pressure as late in the launch countdown as possible, and the launch pad was cleared of all but essential personnel when pressure was increased to 100 percent.

25|$|Hilary Putnam {{has argued}} that any theory of {{mathematical}} realism would include quasi-empirical methods.

40|$|Because of {{inherent}} stochasticity, cost {{implication of}} voltage sags compared to scheduled outages {{are very high}} typically for an industrial or commercial load. Since, different types of equipment behave differently during voltage sag events, and interconnection {{of these types of}} equipment to control a process or a load is very complex, exact cost calculation of voltage sag events is difficult. The favorable or skeptical ways of cost calculation may not indicate the actual <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> process <b>failure,</b> which is essential for performing the cost-benefit analysis to evaluate possible mitigation solutions. Therefore, calculation of 2 ̆ 7 <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> process <b>failure</b> 2 ̆ 7 under voltage sag events assumes significance. This paper critically reviews the concept of 2 ̆ 7 <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> process <b>failure</b> 2 ̆ 7 as viewed by different researchers and highlights the necessity of further research in this area. The overall <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> process <b>failure</b> can be useful for cost-benefit analysis of mitigation methods to minimize the cost implication of voltage sags...|$|R

Ultraviolet light degrades the synthetic materials of the skirt and frame. A well-maintained mask should last for several years.

25|$|Several factors {{combine to}} put credit unions at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> They {{may not be}} allowed to lend enough money to enough people who are willing and able to repay because of their rules on {{responsible}} lending. When debtors get into trouble, they will often repay liabilities such as payday loans with high interest rates first, leaving the credit unions until last. In some cases courts may, after ruling against debtors, leniently allow them to pay off their debts with very small payments, sometimes free of interest, over a long period.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} grind {{telescope}} optics into an accurate shape, a highly versatile material {{must be used}} such as glass. The amateur casting process is usually done through a temperature controlled glass fusing kiln, in which layers or chunks of glass (usually plate or borosilicate glass) are stacked on top of or around each other within a round mold specified to aperture size. After the melting point is reached, the glass fuses together and then the annealing process begins. Proper annealing procedures ensure that internal stresses are relieved within the glass, which reduces <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> for the newly cast blank.|$|E

25|$|A {{critical}} {{phase of}} the cultivation is the quality control of the mycorrhizal plants.
