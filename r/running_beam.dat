40|$|The {{performance}} of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) has been continuously monitored at the LHC. The evolution of this performance is a critical issue for the future. Work has started to assess the need for possible changes to the detector to ensure adequate performance for High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) operation which is planned for 2022 and beyond. In this paper, results from CMS <b>running,</b> <b>beam</b> tests and laboratory measurements on proton-irradiated crystals are combined to predict the {{performance of}} the current detector at the HL-LHC.

40|$|Over {{the past}} seven years, the Jefferson Lab's control system has grown to include {{more than two hundred}} {{distributed}} computers running over a complex segmented network, controlling a number of semi-independent operational plants. Several of the plants, including that used for <b>running</b> <b>beam</b> for physics users, operate around the clock with only brief, scheduled interruptions for machine repairs. Because of this, high control system availability is critical. Dividing computing resources into distinct sections, called fiefdoms, improves availability of the control system for each plant while facilitating periodic maintenance. In order to maximize uptime, each fiefdom operates as a completely independent control system consisting of a file server machine with a complete set of control system software and files, a local network, operator consoles and computers to execute high and low level control programs. The fiefdoms are isolated using network hardware, while still allowing limited communication between them. By segmenting the control system in this manner, the effect of a computer failure is minimized and machines can be taken down for periodic maintenance and upgrades without disabling other controls capabilities for the site...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the random {{vibration}} performance of trains <b>running</b> on continuous <b>beam</b> bridge with vertical track irregularity, a time-domain framework of random analysis on train-bridge coupling system is established. The vertical rail irregularity {{is regarded as a}} random process. A multibody mass-spring-damper model is employed to represent a moving railway car and the bridge system is simulated by finite elements. By introducing the pseudo excitation algorithm into the train-bridge interaction dynamic system, expressions of the mean value, standard deviation, and power spectral density of the nonstationary random dynamic responses of bridge and vehicles are derived. Monte-Carlo simulations are implemented to validate the presented method. A comprehensive analysis of the train-bridge coupling system with vertical track irregularity is conducted focusing on the effect of the randomness of the vertical rail irregularity on the dynamic behavior of the running train and the three-span continuous concrete bridge. Moreover, stochastic characteristics of the indicator for assessing the safety and the riding quality of the railway cars <b>running</b> on continuous <b>beam</b> bridge are carried out, which may be a useful reference in the dynamic design of the bridge...|$|R
