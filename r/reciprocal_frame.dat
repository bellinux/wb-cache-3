40|$|<b>Reciprocal</b> <b>frames</b> and <b>reciprocal</b> {{structures}} {{have already}} been considered of great interest in the past, as witnessed {{by the work of}} Leonardo da Vinci and of other important scientists and architects. Recent researches show that both the shape and the mechanical behaviour of such structures are really complexes, due to the concept of reciprocity. The position of each structural element in the space, indeed, as well as the way they transfer loads, depends on the position and on the role of adjacent elements, so that the structure must be studied as a whole and it can hardly be decomposed in simpler substructures. In this paper we focus on the statical and mechanical determinacy of a specific subset of this kind of structures, i. e. the multiple plane <b>reciprocal</b> <b>frames.</b> In this structures the shape can be easily defined in plane coordinates, so that only the mechanical behaviour needs to be studied. The presence of mechanisms or the possibility of self-stress states is largely related to the kind of internal constraints joining each bar to the others. The study is developed starting from the basic works on pinned bars assemblies [5], [8], in which the statical and kinematical determinacy are discussed by means of a matrix formulation of the equilibrium and compatibility equations.

40|$|Reciprocal {{structures}} or nexorade {{are composed}} by the assembling of {{groups of three}} or more beams mutually connected by mono-lateral T joints {{in a way that}} any relative movement is suppressed. This kind of structures can be easily built in relatively unprepared sites, dismantled, transported and re-used even by not specialized handcraft. For these reasons, reciprocal structures have been widely used in the past for military purposes, and nowadays they seem to satisfy very well the different requirements of a quick and temporary shelter of a large archaeological area when they are shaped as grid shells. This paper proposes the design of a reversible, <b>reciprocal</b> <b>framed</b> grid shell to shelter the archaeological site of the Roman Shipwrecks in Pisa. The structure must protect excavations and archaeologists from the weather and provide an easy access to visitors. Additionally, it must allow for easy disassembling and moving to another site.

40|$|<b>Reciprocal</b> <b>Frames</b> are an {{interesting}} but almost unknown class of structures, based on the assemblage of straight one dimensional elements into spatial structures. They differ from truss structures because elements are joined by contact at intermediate and end points, and they can reach stability without the need of pins. RF aroused lively interest in scientists since antiquity, as the studies of Leonardo da Vinci, Villers de Honnecourt and Sebastiano Serlio confirm, and the interest has increased recently as an effect of the realizations of many timber reciprocal structures all around the world. The research illustrated in the paper concerns {{the study of the}} mechanical behavior of such structures, starting from the kinematic and static determinacy of plane configurations, with the aim to understand the basic properties of these structures. In spite of their apparent simplicity, the mechanics of RF is very complex, involving contact and friction problems, and frequently the geometry itself of two dimensional RF leads to complex analyses. The concept of reciprocity, in fact, make the position of each element determinate by the position of all the other ones, so that large configurations cannot be obtained simply adding new elements to smaller configurations. While recent applications in architecture seem to emphasize the simplicity and the naiveness of this kind of construction, trough timber construction, for instance, or for buildings with a specific social role, as museums or small theaters, we are firmly convinced that RF can be of interest when approached in more technological way. Our research is then specifically oriented to Deployable RE, in which a high tech construction can improve consistently the performances, allowing the design of innovative structures.

One of these is the process of rationalization, where ideas and images are considered as material artifacts that must be built using available resources and technologies. The concept of the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>frame</b> presents an intriguing case for accommodating the limitations of a construction method in the development of form. This thesis explores the range of aesthetic variation available in axially connected reciprocal assemblies by means of experimentation with pattern, physical prototyping, and iterative geometric optimization. The project develops a workflow from form-finding to fabrication within the rigid constraints of this assembly logic, while striving to remain faithful to the tectonic elegance for which this structural concept has historically been valued.

The roof structure of the Euskalduna conference centre and concert hall extension in Bilbao, covering an irregu- lar geometry of 3000 m 2 with a maximum span of 45 m, presented an interesting opportunity to revisit the concept and to apply these classical systems. Furthermore, its analysis and develop- ment led to an interesting discussion on reciprocal frames. They showed great sensitivity of these systems to the local modification of a particular element, establishment of irregular load paths, mobilisation of almost the entire sys- tem when locally applying a punctual load and, finally, its large deformability. Besides, reciprocal frames present particular construction complexities and possibilities due to the moderate length of the structural elements, the predominance of shear-only connec- tions and the necessity of the entire system to be completely erected to guarantee its stability.

40|$|In {{decision-making}} processes for urban planning and design, evaluation {{can be considered}} a relevant tool to build choices, to recognize values, interests and needs, and to explore the different aspects that can influence decisions. Evaluation {{can be considered a}} process to integrate approaches, methods and models, able to support the different needs of the decision-making process itself. According to Trochim and Donnelly (2006), it is possible to define a planning-evaluation cycle with various phases requested by both planners and evaluators. The first phase of such a cycle, the so-called planning phase, is designed in order to elaborate a set of potential actions, programs, or technologies, and select the best ones for implementation. The main stages are related to (1) the formulation of the problem, issue, or concern; (2) the broad conceptualization of the main alternatives to be considered; (3) the detailing of these alternatives and their potential implications; (4) the evaluation of the alternatives and the selection of the preferable one; and (5) the implementation of the selected alternative. These stages are considered inherent to planning, but they need a relevant evaluation work, useful in conceptualization and detailing, and in assessing alternatives and making a choice of the preferable one. The evaluation phase also involves a sequence of stages that includes: (1) the formulation of the major goals and objectives; (2) the conceptualization and operationalization of the major components of the evaluation (program, participants, setting, criteria, measures, etc.); (3) the design of the evaluation, detailing how these components will be coordinated; the analysis of the information, both qualitative and quantitative; and (4) the utilization of the evaluation results. Indeed, evaluation is intrinsic to all types of decision-making and can take different meanings and roles within {{decision-making processes}}, especially if it is related to spatial planning (Alexander, 2006). ”Evaluation in planning” or ”evaluation within planning” seems to better interpret the concept of planning-evaluation proposed by Lichfield (1996) where the binomial name makes explicit the close interaction and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>framing</b> of evaluation and planning: evaluation is conceived as deeply embedded in planning, affecting planning, and evolving with it (Cerreta, 2010). Indeed, the evolution of evaluation methods reflects their evolving relationship with the planning process {{and the way in which}} they interact with the diversity and multiplicity of domains and values. To identify an analytic and evaluative structure able to integrate different purposes and multidimensional values within the decision-making processes means to develop evaluation frameworks not focusing only on the environmental, social and economic effects of different options, but also considering the nature of the stakes, selecting priorities and values in a multidimensional perspective. It is crucial to structure complex decision-making processes oriented to an integrated planning, that can support the selection, the monitoring and the management of different resources, and the interaction among decision-makers, decision-takers, stakeholders and local community...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} few years, the {{emergence}} of spatial light modulators operating at the tens of kHz has enabled new imaging modalities based on single-pixel photodetectors. The nature of single-pixel imaging enforces a <b>reciprocal</b> relationship between <b>frame</b> rate and image size.

Here, we introduce an adaptive compressive technique based on wavelet trees within this framework. In our adaptive approach, the resolution of the projecting patterns remains deliberately small, which is crucial to avoid the demanding memory requirements of compressive sensing algorithms.

These networks produce interesting architectural and engineering opportunities and challenges. The opportunities include the creation of roof and standalone structures that have distinctive architectural expression. The challenges include {{the determination of the}} often-complex configuration geometry between the elements and their connection system. A key feature of sloping RF and MSE geometry is that at the joint locations the element's centroidal axes generally do not coincide. An eccentricity at these positions has therefore to be incorporated within the connection system. This has a direct impact on element sizing, connection design, fabrication and erection sequences. RF and MSE spatial structure networks give rise to complex structural behaviour. Element-to-element connection eccentricity orientation is a controlling key feature in the determination of how the forces, moments and stresses are distributed between MSEs. The orientation of the eccentricity can be random or aligned to produce a vertical intersection distance as generally used in RF construction.
