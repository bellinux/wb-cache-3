5|$|The {{death of}} El-Sherbini {{immediately}} resulted in international reactions, {{with the most}} vocal responses coming from predominantly Muslim nations.

40|$|Abstract: The {{realities of}} {{globalization}} enable increasing familiarity with cultures, customs, and religions {{not long ago}} deemed obscure. Yet, not all {{the consequences of this}} compression of space and culture are desirable or favorable. The closeness of peoples and familiarity with diverse cultures has not automatically resulted in an embrace of differences, of the “other”. Rather, globalization, perhaps unwittingly, has inflamed religious, national, ethnic, and <b>racial</b> <b>hatreds</b> and strife, as well as sex and gender subordination and marginalization. The topic of women and globalization raises fundamental questions on the impact of globalization on women, ethnic minorities and other sociodemographically under-represented actors in global organizations. This article seeks to integrate theories of procedural justice, psychological contracts, motivation in global organizations, and the implications for women, and other under-represented actors. Our analysis concurs with current research on the need for a relativist perspective in business ethics. Our contribution is to show that globalization is a complex process that has different impacts on actors, an impact that can vary widely depending on the situation of the actors...|$|R
