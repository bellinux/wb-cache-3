An automobile hubcap is used to cover the wheel hub and the wheel fasteners to reduce the accumulation of dirt and moisture. It also has the function of decorating the car.|$|E
5000|$|The wheel {{diameter}} on a trials unicycle is usually 19" [...] or 20", as this allows greater maneuverability {{due to the}} short circumference of the wheel. Most Trials unicycles come with 19" [...] rear rims as used on 20" [...] (or mod) trials bicycles. This allows for larger tyres to be fitted which can help provide bounce and preload for jumping, and aid stability being generally quite wide (some up to 2.5 inches).A smaller wheel also means the unicycle is lighter, although some riders prefer larger wheels. The tire is generally wide and thick, giving a large air volume. This is to cushion drops and allow large hops and jumps. The tire will often have a deep tread to allow greater grip to obstacles. Strong high tension spokes and a strong <b>rim</b> <b>wheel</b> rim is used to prevent the wheel from deforming under the great stresses exerted on it by jumping. Unicycle wheels have to withstand large lateral stresses because, unlike in conventional riding, the rider may jump sideways. Many trials unicycles have a splined hub and cranks, as this design {{tends to be more}} resistant to bending and breaking than the more common cotterless, or square taper, equivalent. Long cranks give the rider extra torque and pedals with a large amount of grip (often with pins or teeth) are used to prevent the rider's feet from slipping. Unicycles with shorter cranks are generally referred to as street unicycles, as they let the rider keep up their momentum easier and do smooth tricks. Whereas Trials unicycles usually have longer cranks that are better for hopping, as the rider has better control of the rotation of the wheel, and can therefore keep the unicycle from slipping out from under him.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Shattered <b>rim</b> <b>wheel</b> failures, {{although}} {{relatively rare}} in North American railway freight service, remain {{a major concern}} for railways and wheel manufacturers since such failures can occur under a train at high speed, and can result in dangerous, expensive derailments. Shattered rim fatigue cracks typically initiate and grow {{at a depth of}} 12 to 20 mm (1 / 2 to 3 / 4 inches) below the wheel tread surface. To help further reduce the incidence of these wheel failures, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) recently adopted a wheel steel microcleanliness specification based upon ASTM E 1245. A major North American railroad has used this microcleanliness evaluation method, which involves using quantitative image analysis techniques to analyze six polished metallographic samples removed from the wheel rim, for several years. Alternative effective methods of microcleanliness evaluation, which could be performed faster in-house, would be desirable from a wheel manufacturing point of view. This paper discusses the use of two alternative microcleanliness measurement methods, phased array ultrasonic testing and the Spark-Dat system, to determine the cleanliness of wheel steel samples. An ultrasonic evaluation of several wheel rims is first conducted to provide counts and sizes of indications within the rim. From this information an ultrasonic cleanliness determination is made. Next, the Spark-Dat system is described and the basic principles of its operation are reviewed. Samples removed from th...|$|E

40|$|In December 2007, a male {{equipment}} operator was fatally {{injured by}} a metal lock ring propelled from a multi-piece wheel tire assembly he was inflating. The victim was employed by an excavating and snow removal company. At {{the time of}} the incident, he and a co-worker were getting their loaders ready to remove snow from a shopping mall parking lot. Soon after he started his loader, the victim noticed that his left front tire mounted on a multi-piece wheel was “soft”(under-inflated). The multi-piece <b>rim</b> <b>wheel</b> referring to the tire assembly consisted of six components: the rim base, valve assembly, tire, side ring, O-ring and lock ring. The function of the lock ring was to hold the tire in place by locking and securing the other wheel components when the tire was inflated. The victim asked the co-worker, whose loader had an air compressor, to put air in the tire. The initial tire pressure was not checked. The co-worker connected one end of an air hose to the quick-connect fitting on the air compressor and the clip-on chuck at the other end to the valve stem of the tire. The co-worker then went to his loader’s cab and used the throttle control to maintain the airflow. The air hose did not have an in-line pressure gauge. The victim checked the air pressure at the tire valve with a hand-held pressure gauge periodically as the tire was being inflated. The maximum cold tire inflation pressure specified by the tire manufacturer was 35 pounds per square inch (psi). After a few minutes, the victi...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeIn {{wheelchair}} tennis propulsion of {{the wheelchair}} is different for both hands, since the athlete has to hold a tennis racket in one hand. Differences in propulsion technique, i. e. forces and timing, have been found between propelling the wheelchair with and without a racket in the hand [1]. Optimizing the coupling of the hand with the racket to the rim is expected to lead to performance improvement Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to explore different technical solutions for the interface between the hand, racket and the rim in order to optimize propulsion technique during wheelchair tennis when holding a racket. MethodsA limited literature study was done on the interface between the hand, racket and the rim. Qualitative interviews were held with (sub) top Dutch tennis players and trainers to gain insight in their technique. Video analysis of training and tennis matches of (sub) top Dutch tennis players were made to acquire knowledge of the hand and racket positions. A list of requirements and several ideas were developed. Different prototypes of (a part of) a rim were 3 d printed and tested in laboratory settings. ResultsThe literature study showed an increase of effectivity of propulsive force by creating a larger contact area and increased friction; different textures and/or materials can create an increased friction. The video analysis showed a variety of racket positions between players and within players at different speeds. Five different design components and the connections between them were explored: push <b>rim,</b> <b>wheel,</b> the tire, the hand and the racket. Prototypes with a larger contact area and/or different material showed higher isometric peak forces. ConclusionThis study shows different technical solutions for the interface between the hand, racket and the rim, which will improve propulsion technique during wheelchair tennis. The technical solutions are; different shape of the rim and/or using textures and/or materials with high friction coefficient on the rim and/or hand...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} detect leaks {{on the surface of}} a <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> manufactured by aluminum die casting and forging. Leaks in the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> may be caused by temperature gradient differences during the cooling period, impurities, or flowing air bubbles in the die casting process. We developed a new low-cost approach to detect leaks that only required a short inspection time by observing the movement of soap bubbles on the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> surface. We designed new light sources to minimize mirror image effects and irregular luminance distributions on the curved <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> surface. A preprocessing procedure for image processing was also developed to determine the bubble configurations using threshold and morphology techniques. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the inspection system. The results demonstrated that leaks generated during the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> manufacturing process could be accurately detected even under various environmental lighting conditions...|$|R
