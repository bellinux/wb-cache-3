[...] Various ISPs have experimented with intercepting <b>return</b> <b>messages</b> of non-existent domain names and {{replacing them with}} advertising content.

Kaminsky demonstrated this process by setting up Rickrolls on Facebook and PayPal. While the vulnerability used initially depended in part that Earthlink was using Barefruit to provide its advertising, Kaminsky was able to generalize the vulnerability to attack Verizon by attacking its ad provider, Paxfire.|$|E

50|$|In 1981, Chaum {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} an anonymous communication network in a paper. His proposal, called mix networks, allows a group of senders to submit an encryption of a message and its recipient to a server. Once the server has a batch of messages, it will reorder and obfuscate the messages so that only this server knows which message came from which sender. The batch is then forwarded to another server who does the same process. Eventually, the messages reach the final server where they are fully decrypted and delivered to the recipient. A mechanism to allow <b>return</b> <b>messages</b> is also proposed. Mix networks are the basis of some remailers and are the conceptual ancestor to modern anonymous web browsing tools like Tor (based on onion routing). Chaum has advocated that every router be made, effectively, a Tor node.|$|E
5000|$|One {{of their}} homing pigeons, a Blue Check hen named Cher Ami, {{was awarded the}} French [...] "Croix de Guerre with Palm" [...] for heroic service {{delivering}} 12 important messages during the Battle of Verdun. On her final mission in October 1918, she delivered a message despite having been shot through the breast or wing.

Pigeons were carried in airplanes to rapidly <b>return</b> <b>messages</b> to these stations; and 829 birds flew in 10,995 wartime aircraft patrols. Airmen of the 230 patrols with messages entrusted to pigeons threw the message-carrying pigeon either up or down, {{depending on the type}} of aircraft, to keep the pigeon out of the propeller and away from airflow toward the aircraft wings and struts. Eleven of the thrown pigeons went missing in action, but the remaining 219 messages were delivered successfully.|$|E

50|$|Ted spends {{increasingly}} {{more time with}} Belisa {{and away from the}} office. Ted is falling hard for Belisa, who postpones her wedding to Jamie; the couple had planned a honeymoon to Jamaica and decides to marry Ted. But Ted's sales performance is dropping dramatically, and since his contribution to the company's profit is so important, the rest of the sales force feels even more pressure. Branch manager John Whitman (Daniel Stern) has prospered with Ted's performance, but starts losing confidence in Ted, and is mystified at Ted's lack of dedication, such a contrast from his previous strong effort. Belisa seems ready to end her engagement to Jamie in favor of Ted, as the two travel to Atlantic City for a getaway from the stress, and use Jamie's week-long absence at a training conference to deepen their relationship. However, the company is in trouble from plummeting sales, not just in New York but at its other locations as well, and downsizing and firings are imminent. Just as Ted's new relationship with Belisa is prospering, his career is sinking. He no longer cares about his career; he avoids the office, doesn't answer his phone or <b>return</b> <b>messages,</b> fails to close several critical deals, and this drives the company closer to ruin. However, his relationship with Belisa, who now promises to leave Jamie and get married to Ted, is creating real change in his life, healing his bitterness. Jamie, showing no improvement whatsoever in his job performance is fired just as Belisa breaks their engagement and asks him to move out. He becomes suspicious that Belisa is cheating on him and nears a nervous breakdown. Belisa becomes very concerned and meets with Ted to break off their affair so she can take care of Jamie, informing him they are returning to Ohio together tomorrow. Ted is devastated at Belisa's change of heart, but finally returns to the office the next day to find manager Whitman desperate for him to make some sales as his own career is on the line. Belisa surprises Ted in the parking lot, telling him Jamie went back to Ohio, but she has decided to stay in New York to marry him.|$|E

The problem of scheduling divisible load on star platforms turns out to be very difficult as soon as <b>return</b> <b>messages</b> are involved. Unfortunately, {{we have not been able}} to assess its complexity, but we provide an optimal solution in the special (but important) case of FIFO communication schemes. We also provide an explicit formula for the optimal number of load units that can be processed by a FIFO ordering on a bus network. Finally, we provide a set of MPI experiments to assess the accuracy and usefulness of our results in a real framework...|$|E

40|$|While {{multistage}} switching {{networks for}} vector multiprocessors {{have been studied}} extensively, detailed evaluations of their performance are rare. Indeed, analytical models, simulations with pseudo-synthetic loads, studies focused on average-value parameters, and measurements of networks disconnected from the machine, all provide limited information. In this paper, instead, we present an in-depth empirical analysis of a multistage switching network in a realistic setting: we use hardware probes to examine {{the performance of the}} omega network of the Cedar shared-memory machine executing real applications. The machine is configured with 16 vector processors. The analysis suggests that the performance of multistage switching networks is limited by traffic non-uniformities. We identify two major non-uniformities that degrade Cedar's performance and are likely to slow down other networks too. The first one is the contention caused by the <b>return</b> <b>messages</b> in a vector access as they converge fr [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{point-to-multipoint}} routing problem in an ATM network that uses Virtual Paths (VP's). In multicast, a source node wishes to transmit the same packets {{to a number}} of destination nodes. The destination nodes send <b>return</b> <b>messages</b> to the source and packets from different nodes are not the same. We consider ATM networks with asymmetric and symmetric VP's and the performance factors studied are bandwidth, establishment and switching costs. We also propose and study a new type of VP, VP with intermediate exit, where a node that performs VP switching can copy the switched packets for the local destination. We present mathematical formulations of the multicast routing problems and develop heuristics for finding a low cost multicast routing tree. The heuristics are based on the Transshipment Simplex Algorithm. 1 Introduction The Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a much studied technology that is likely to provide the basis of future high-speed networks carrying broadband servi [...] ...|$|E
