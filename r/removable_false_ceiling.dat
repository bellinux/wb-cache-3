40|$|Between 2003 and 2007 {{an urban}} network of road tunnels {{with a total}} {{constructed}} tubes length of 45 km {{was built in the}} city of Madrid. This amazing engineering work, known as “Calle 30 Project” counted with different kinds of tunnel typologies and ventilation systems. Due to the length of the tunnels and the impact of the work itself, the tunnels were endowed with a great variety of installations to provide the maximum levels of safety both for users and the infrastructure including,in some parts of the tunnel, fixed fire fighting system based on water mist. Within this framework a large-scale campaign of fire tests were planned to study different aspects related to fire safety in the tunnels including the phenomena of the interaction between ventilation and extinction system. In addition, this large scale fire tests allowed fire brigades of the city of Madrid an opportunity to define operational procedures for specific fire fighting in tunnels and evaluate the possibilities of fixed fire fighting systems. The tests were carried out in the Center of Experimentation "San Pedro of Anes" which counts with a 600 m tunnel with a <b>removable</b> <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> for reproducing different ceiling heights and ventilation conditions (transverse and longitudinal ones). Interesting conclusions on the interaction of ventilation and water mist systems were obtained but also on other aspects including performance of water mist system in terms of reduction of gas temperatures or visibility conditions. This paper presents a description of the test’s campaign carried out and some previous results obtained...|$|E

50|$|ECONOMICLower {{concrete}} cost with {{an equal}} thickness. Lower steel cost. Savings in useful height on each level as there are no emerging beams. Possibility to gain floors at the same building height (towers) and building volume. Quick and easy to implement. Also indicated for the top-down technique.Possibility of large span at equal load or high load bearing capacity at an equal span. Economical and easy to transport, handle and store, also outdoors.The soffit has a flat surface that is ready to finish and {{does not require a}} <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> for aesthetic purposes.

50|$|A dropped {{ceiling is}} a {{secondary}} ceiling, hung below the main (structural) ceiling. It {{may also be}} referred to as a drop <b>ceiling,</b> T-bar <b>ceiling,</b> <b>false</b> <b>ceiling,</b> suspended ceiling, grid ceiling, drop in ceiling, drop out ceiling, or ceiling tiles and is a staple of modern construction and architecture in both residential and commercial applications.|$|R
50|$|The <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{above the}} roadway, which {{consisted}} of a 6 in, insitu, reinforced concrete slab, collapsed completely in several places and collapsed partially over a length of approximately 500 feet (150 m).|$|R
50|$|A gallery {{for staff}} use was also {{created in the}} Tiled Hall where further book stock was shelved and work space was created for the typists from the {{cataloguing}} department. The ceiling and walls of the Tiled Hall were then hidden for nearly fifty years behind a <b>false</b> <b>ceiling,</b> bookcases and panelling. The Music Library was moved into the Tiled Hall space in 1998 but was only there until 1999, when the Central Library building closed for refurbishment and rewiring. The 1950s panelling and bookcases were removed, along with the <b>false</b> <b>ceiling,</b> to once more reveal the Tiled Hall and the inevitable damage caused by work done in the 1950s.|$|R

50|$|Also, if true, it mirrors events {{decades earlier}} in the fatal Henderson's Department Store Fire in Liverpool, where a fire {{strongly}} suspected as starting in electrical cabling rapidly spread in and across <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> space, hidden until it broke out ferociously across a large area.|$|R
50|$|Despite waiters' {{efforts to}} douse {{the fire with}} water, it spread along the fronds of the palm tree. In a final desperate attempt to {{separate}} the burning fronds from the fabric-covered <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> the decoration was {{pulled away from the}} corner, taking with it a triangular plywood panel at the ceiling level and opening the enclosed space above the <b>false</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Coincidentally or not, that was {{the point at which the}} fire spread to the <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> which burned rapidly, showering patrons with sparks and burning shreds of fabric. Flames raced up the stairway to the main level, burning the hair of patrons fleeing up the stairs. A fireball burst through the front entryway and spread through the remaining club areas: through the adjacent Caricature Bar, down a corridor to the Broadway Lounge, and across the central restaurant and dance floor as the orchestra was beginning its evening show. Flames raced faster than patrons could move, followed by thick clouds of smoke. Within five minutes, flames and smoke had spread to the entire nightclub. Some patrons were instantly overcome by smoke as they sat in their seats. Others crawled through the smoky darkness trying to find exits, all but one of which were either non-functioning or hidden in non-public areas.|$|R

50|$|The last live {{performance}} in the Opera House was The Arabian, in 1926. Soon after, the transformation into a movie house was launched.

50|$|In 1968, a {{windstorm}} {{caused the}} <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> to collapse, which raised attention for {{leaders in the}} urban renewal project to demolish the theatre.
