2500|$|Before the Reformation, friars in Glasgow {{rang the}} dead bell {{through the streets}} for the repose of {{the soul of the}} deceased, {{especially}} if the individual was a benefactor of the church. It is known that the ancient bell of Saint Mungo (aka Saint Kentigern) was used for this purpose. From 1454 a record survives of the bell being rung annually for the soul of Johne Steuart (John Stewart), the first Provost of Glasgow, who had left lands and property to the church. [...] A record of 1509 for Sir Archibald Crawfurd of Cadder also shows that the ringing of the dead bell sometimes took place more than once and was intended to encourage others to pray for the deceased, his ancestors, and other Christian souls. In 1594 the presbytery of Glasgow attempted to recover the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of the dead bell, arguing that it was an ecclesiastical and not a secular function.|$|E
2500|$|These {{inalienable}} possessions are a form {{of property}} that is inalienable, yet they can be exchanged. Property {{can be thought of}} as a bundle of rights – the right to use something, the right to collect rent from someone, the right to extract something (as in oil drilling), the right to hunt within a particular territory. [...] That ownership may be a bundle of rights held in common by groups of individuals or lineages. The property thus becomes impossible to separate from the group owning it. [...] "To give in this instant means to transfer without alienating, or to use the language of the West, to give means to cede the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> without ceding actual ownership". [...] In other words, Weiner is contending that an economy built around the moral code of gift giving provides the giver rights over what he/she has given and in turn [...] "subsequently benefits from a series of advantages." [...] Thus, when one accepts a gift one also accepts that the giver now has rights over the receiver.|$|E

However, a decentralized system has weaknesses. It can result in conflicts and defaults of enforcement that might discourage investments. It can also induce inefficient capture of public goods and favor the development of monopolies. Implementing a last resort authority in charge of limiting and preventing these inefficiencies might result in a more efficient <b>use</b> <b>of</b> resources.
