40|$|The {{analysis}} of traffic from wide and {{local area network}} sites show that <b>cyclical</b> <b>trends</b> are a characteristic feature in transport control protocol (TCP) traffic. The pattern of the estimates of conditional expectations indicate that cyclical behavior is restricted {{to a set of}} amplitude regimes in the traffic rate process. The application of non-linear processes to model the aforementioned features is investigated. A non-linear time series model captures the traffic features with a reduced number of parameters relative to a linear model and is more accurate in its reconstruction of the autocorrelation estimates. The control mechanism in TCP and stochastic properties of the ack round-trip-times can play a fundamental role in generating <b>cyclical</b> <b>trends</b> in TCP traffic. A simulation based {{analysis of}} TCP is presented that demonstrates how the control mechanism in TCP can induce periodic components into a random application layer traffic stream. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} public and private {{involvement}} in economic activity in societies has changed over time. One may talk about the existence of a <b>cyclical</b> <b>trend</b> in which the most important periods of public governance are replaced by periods in which private management dominates the situation. This phenomenon may also be observed in local areas. Some authors have pointed out the existence of an alternation in the provision of municipal services, resulting in periods dominated by governance compared to other stages dominated by private management. In order to illustrate this <b>cyclical</b> <b>trend</b> at local level, this paper intends to analyze the evolution of the governance of the Spanish water supply since the mid-nineteenth century to the present day.

To explain this phenomenon requires the introduction of other factors into the exchange rate equation. Among the variables that proved significant are the Canadian terms of trade, measures of long-term borrowing, the <b>relative</b> <b>cyclical</b> position of Canada and the United States, and the market's errors in forecasting the current account balance. When used together with relative prices, these variables track {{the movement of the}} Canadian dollar very satisfactorily over the period. ...|$|R
40|$|Growth cycles {{are often}} mistaken for {{business}} cycles, although these two have different statistical properties. In order {{to differentiate between}} them in a statistically satisfactory manner, the Bayesian information criterion-(BIC) based model-selection approach is presented. Business cycles are described by the <b>cyclical</b> <b>trend</b> model, and growth cycles are described by the trend-plus-cycle model. Whether the observed time series is derived from business cycles or from growth cycles is determined {{as a result of}} model selection. It is shown via data-based simulations that the proposed method works well in most situations. Empirical results obtained for 15 countries suggest that the business cycle model is selected for five countries, the growth cycle model is selected for two countries and the trend-plus-noise model is selected for eight countries. ...|$|R

40|$|First, to {{determine}} if a <b>cyclical</b> <b>trend</b> is observed for search activity of suicide and three common suicide risk factors in the United Kingdom: depression, unemployment, and marital strain. Second, to test the validity of suicide search data as a potential marker of suicide risk by evaluating whether web searches for suicide associate with suicide rates among those of different ages and genders in the United Kingdom. Cross-sectional. Search engine data was obtained from Google Trends, a publicly available repository of information of trends and patterns of user searches on Google. The following phrases were entered into Google Trends to analyse relative search volume for suicide, depression, job loss, and divorce, respectively: 'suicide'; 'depression + depressed + hopeless'; 'unemployed + lost job'; 'divorce'. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was employed to test bivariate associations between suicide search activity and official suicide rates from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). <b>Cyclical</b> <b>trends</b> were observed in search activity for suicide and depression-related search activity, with peaks in autumn and winter months, and a trough in summer months. A positive, non-significant association was found between suicide-related search activity and suicide rates in the general working-age population (15 - 64 years) (ρ =  0. 164; P =  0. 652). This association is stronger in younger age groups, particularly for those 25 - 34 years of age (ρ =  0. 848; P =  0. 002). We give credence to a link between search activity for suicide and suicide rates in the United Kingdom from 2004 to 2013 for high risk sub-populations (i. e. male youth and young professionals). There remains a need for further research on how Google Trends can be used in other areas of disease surveillance and for work to provide greater geographical precision, as well as research on ways of mitigating the risk of internet use leading to suicide ideation in youth...|$|R

One explanation for the time effect is the general relaxation of the labour and training market in recent years (see Fig.  3). These <b>cyclical</b> <b>trends</b> lead to an increasing total net supply of training positions (BMBF 2012).

The dynamics of self-employment varies between areas characterized by different labour market conditions, entrepreneurial traditions and other structural factors. This article analyses self-employment spells in Finland with a large register-based data set from the period 1987 to 2002. The main aim is to investigate the role of region-specific factors as compared with individual-specific and other factors on the duration of self-employment spells. First, the descriptive analysis shows that the exit rates from self-employment and the length of self-employment spells depend upon location (urban versus rural area) and the <b>cyclical</b> <b>trends</b> in the economy. Second, self-employment duration is modelled using discrete time survival analysis.
