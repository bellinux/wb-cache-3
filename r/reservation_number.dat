50|$|The {{introduction}} of InWATS fortuitously fell {{around the same}} time as the early centralized, automated national airline and hotel reservation systems, including Sabre (American Airlines, 1963), Holidex (Holiday Inn, 1965) and Reservatron (Sheraton, 1969). Hundreds of local <b>reservation</b> <b>numbers</b> for a major chain could be replaced with one central number, backed by a national computerized reservation system.|$|R

Upon purchase, passengers {{are given a}} <b>reservation</b> <b>number</b> which they show the bus operator when they board. In the United States, tickets are not available from the bus operator. In Canada, owing to franchise regulations, tickets are sold at stops at a fixed price (generally higher than purchasing the ticket through the website).|$|E

If {{multiple}} people are traveling together, the tickets are linked together by the same record locator or <b>reservation</b> <b>number,</b> which are assigned, if the tickets were purchased at the same time. If not, most airlines can cross-reference the tickets together in their reservation systems.

[...] A canceled or completed trip does not erase the record since “copies of the PNRs are ‘purged’ from live to archival storage systems, and can be retained indefinitely by CRSs, airlines, and travel agencies.” Further, CRS-GDS companies maintain web sites that allow almost unrestricted access to PNR data - often, the information is accessible by just the <b>reservation</b> <b>number</b> printed on the ticket.|$|E

The population on the Osage the <b>reservation</b> <b>numbered</b> 1,644. The Osage {{were described as}} being a religious people who were honest and having pride in their heritage. The Kaw on the reservation were counted at 209. The Kaw populace {{was described as a}} generous people who gave away their own possessions to others. On June 22, 1893, the Commission attempted negotiation with the Osage, and the Kaw. Neither tribe was interested in negotiating. Section 8 of the Dawes act excluded the Osage, so they could not be compelled to accept allotments. The Osage had their own government with a written constitution. The Kaw refused to entertain the idea of allotments unless the Commission was able to secure an agreement with the Ponca.|$|R

50|$|The {{official}} {{unemployment rate}} on reservations {{as of the}} 2000 census was 14 percent, but there is much variation. Reservations nearer urban centers, especially on the East Coast, tend to have employment rates similar to or {{higher than the national}} average. On many large, rural reservations, though, a majority of adults are unemployed or out of the workforce. On reservations in California, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Florida, Washington, New Mexico, Nebraska, Montana, and Alaska, reservation unemployment rates are above 25 percent. On some California <b>reservations,</b> the <b>number</b> exceeds 75 percent.|$|R

50|$|Gaming creates many jobs, {{not only}} for native Americans, but also for {{non-native}} Americans, {{and in this way}} can positively affect relations with the non-native American community. On some <b>reservations,</b> the <b>number</b> of non-native American workers is larger than the number of Native American workers because of the scale of the casino resorts. Also, some tribes contribute a share of casino revenues to the state in which they are located, or to charitable and non-profit causes. For example, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians of California gave 4 million dollars to the UCLA Law School to establish a center for American Indian Studies. The same tribe also gave $1 million to the state for disaster relief when the area was ravaged by wildfires in 2003.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Civil War, the U.S. {{attempted}} to persuade the Plains Indians to live on <b>reservations.</b> A <b>number</b> of simultaneous military expeditions were launched in pursuit of this policy under the overall control of General Grant. General Winfield Scott Hancock commanded one such enterprise in West Kansas. Its chief, but not only, target was the Southern Cheyenne in the Smoky Hills region. In April 1867, Hancock moved a large force to Fort Larned and demanded that Indian leaders meet him there. The idea was to intimidate the Indians with a show of force. He was warned by Edward W. Wynkoop, the Indian agent for the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho, that this would be seen by the Indians as an aggressive act and was inappropriate for peace negotiations. Hancock ignored this advice.|$|R

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{nature of}} human cyto-megalovirus (CMV) is widely recognized. It has a high incidence in some institu-tionalized populations (1) and among family contacts of persons who are excret-ing virus (2). In addition, Rowe et al. (3), {{as well as others}} (4, 5) demonstrated that a high per cent of the adult popula-tion is serologically positive. Evidence suggests, moreover, that the agent is a latent virus, similar to herpes simplex in its ability to reside {{for long periods of time}} in the host (6, 7). Viruses which are both common and latent in the host are frequently isolated from patients with etiologically unrelated diseases. While several authors (4, 7) have cautioned that viral isolation with-out serologic support must be interpreted with <b>reservation,</b> a <b>number</b> of case re-ports of cytomegalovirus infection have utilized viral isolation as the sole basis of diagnostic confirmation.

40|$|Abstract. A {{method of}} {{compositional}} verification is presented {{that uses the}} combination of temporal case splitting and data type reductions to reduce types of infinite or unbounded range to small finite types, and arrays of infinite or unbounded size to small fixed-size arrays. This supports the verification by model checking of systems with unbounded resources and uninterpreted functions. The method is illustrated by application to an implementation of Tomasulo’s algorithm, for arbitrary or infinite word size, register file size, <b>number</b> of <b>reservation</b> stations and <b>number</b> of execution units. ...|$|R

[...] Observers can spot blue herons, egrets, ducks, and migrating shorebirds {{that can be found}} in the marshes. Ospreys can be seen swooping down to pluck fish from the Atlantic Ocean. Butterfly watchers can see monarchs, sulphur butterflies, and red admirals that stop here to drink nectar from wildflowers before continuing their southward migration.|$|R
50|$|However, their reduced numbers {{resulted}} in the Sinixt being unable to control development of the area as it was flooded with miners during a second mineral rush in the 1880s and 1890s. Several boomtowns were erected throughout the West Kootenay and Boundary Country regions. The majority of Sinixt continued to live in Washington State on the Colville <b>Reservation.</b> Nevertheless, a <b>number</b> of Sinixt remained permanently in Canada {{during the first half}} of the 20th century. Many others also returned to their ancestral land in B.C., to hunt and fish during the summer months, well into the 20th Century.|$|R

Knapweed is spreading along the power lines. [...] Deer also pose a threat to the natural resources at the <b>reservation.</b> When deer <b>numbers</b> are high, browsing pressures can impact forest regeneration and plant species composition. Current browsing pressures at Rock House do not appear to be obvious which could be due to surrounding lands and part of the Reservation which have been open to hunting.|$|R
