And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the <b>right</b> <b>things</b> in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E
25|$|Pen-and-paper {{role-playing}} games typically {{involve a}} player called the gamemaster (or GM for short) who can dynamically create the story, setting, and rules, and {{react to a}} player's choices. In role-playing video games, the computer performs {{the function of the}} gamemaster. This offers the player a smaller set of possible actions, since computers can't engage in imaginative acting comparable to a skilled human gamemaster. In exchange, the typical role-playing video game may have storyline branches, user interfaces, and stylized cutscenes and gameplay to offer a more direct storytelling mechanism. Characterization of non-player characters in video games is often handled using a dialog tree. Saying the <b>right</b> <b>things</b> to the right non-player characters will elicit useful information for the player, and may even result in other rewards such as items or experience, as well as opening up possible storyline branches. Multiplayer online role-playing games can offer an exception to this contrast by allowing human interaction among multiple players and in some cases enabling a player to perform the role of a gamemaster.|$|E

500|$|According to Gould, the Beatles {{changed the}} way people listened to popular music and {{experienced}} its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what {{was seen as an}} embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism. According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the [...] "more popular than Jesus" [...] controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the <b>right</b> <b>things</b> and [...] "began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness".|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the original version, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn has earned a generally positive reception and robust sales numbers. Prior to release, both the games press and fans were surprised by its quality and level of polish. IGN's Charles Onyett cited many specific improvements over aspects of the initial game and recognized that [...] "it seems like Square's doing the <b>right</b> <b>things</b> to fix the many mistakes made with Final Fantasy XIVs original design". Following an impressive showing at Gamescom 2012, it won Destructoid's Gamescom Community Choice Award. The editorial staff observed [...] "the considerable changes made to the engine, HUD and combat system, transforming it into {{a far cry from}} the game that disappointed so many". However, GameSpot's Jonathan Toyad was less confident about the game, praising the changes but commenting that many features would seem overly familiar to players of modern MMORPGs.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{sequence}} of [...] "Jame Raho" [...] establishes {{the characters of}} the four members of Ishaan's family; for example, the father is hardworking and responsible, and Yohaan is an [...] "ideal son" [...] who does all the <b>right</b> <b>things.</b> A robotic style of music overlaps most of the sequence—this is mirrored by the machine-like morning routines of the mother, father, and Yohaan—but changes for Ishaan's portion to imply that he {{is different from the}} rest. This concept is furthered by speed ramping and having the camera sway with the music to create a distinct style. The twilight scenes of [...] "Maa" [...] were a particular issue for the production crew. Because the specific lighting only lasted ten to fifteen minutes a day, the scenes took nearly ten evenings to film. Production at one time considered having a child singing, but ultimately deemed it too over the top and felt it would connect to more people if sung by an adult. Shankar initially performed the song as a sample—they planned to replace him with another singer—but production eventually decided that his rendition was best.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1940 convention, Roosevelt {{described}} Willkie's nomination as a [...] "Godsend to our country", because it {{ensured that the}} presidential race would not turn {{on the issue of}} aid to Britain. Walter Lippmann believed Willkie's nomination to have been crucial to Britain's survival, [...] "second only to the Battle of Britain, the sudden rise and nomination of Willkie was the decisive event, perhaps providential, which made it possible to rally the free world when [...] was almost conquered. Under any other leadership but his the Republican party in 1940 would have turned its back on Great Britain, causing all who resisted Hitler to feel abandoned". Charles Peters wrote that [...] "it is arguable that [...] impact on [...] and the world was greater than that of most men who actually held the office [...] At a crucial moment in history, he stood for the <b>right</b> <b>things</b> at the right time."

500|$|The Karma {{system in}} the game came about {{as a result of}} the team wanting to include the [...] "judicious use of power" [...] within the game. Fox commented that they wanted to lead the player along a path of doing the harder tasks believing that these actions were the <b>right</b> <b>things</b> to do. However, without the {{contrast}} of [...] "evil" [...] tasks that were simpler to complete, there would be no means of motivating the player to be a [...] "selfless hero". The team wanted to encourage players to think about the results of not only large decisions—Karma moments in the game where Cole thinks of which option to select—but also every moment-to-moment action, such as considering the presence of civilians in the area around a battle. They arranged for the first major use of Cole's powers to turn the city's inhabitants against him, to encourage players to consider both sides. In this mission, Cole is given the option to keep a drop-supply of food for himself or to give it to the people; they found that most players would give it to the people, but very shortly after this event, the population turns against Cole due to evidence linking him to the explosion, forcing the player to run or to attack them. Fox compared the Karma dichotomy to the differences in styles of Batman versus the Punisher; the former using precision attacks to avoid harming innocents while the latter would hurt anything in his path to complete his goal. To that end, they designed the powers in the game to reflect this nature; powers acquired with Good Karma would be more precise while Evil Karma powers were more destructive.|$|E
