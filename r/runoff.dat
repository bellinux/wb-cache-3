5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm <b>runoff</b> that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When <b>runoff</b> exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E

In 2015, same car and driver {{finished}} 2nd at the Daytona <b>Runoffs.</b> In 2016, a new lighter weight M20FC was driven by Jim Devenport to first place at the <b>Runoffs</b> in P1 at Mid-Ohio giving Norma its first <b>Runoffs</b> victory.|$|R
50|$|The SCCA National Championship <b>Runoffs</b> has crowned Formula 500 National Champions since 1997. The {{original}} Formula 440 class competed at the SCCA <b>Runoffs</b> from 1984 - 1996.|$|R
50|$|The SCCA National Championship <b>Runoffs</b> is the end-of-year {{championship}} race {{meeting for}} Sports Car Club of America Club Racing competitors. Divisional champions {{and other top}} drivers from the SCCA's 116 regions are invited to participate at the <b>Runoffs.</b> National championships are awarded to the winners of each class. Formula Ford (now Formula F) was first included in the <b>Runoffs</b> in 1969.|$|R
5|$|In 1935, Johnson was one {{of three}} contenders for the Democratic {{nomination}} for lieutenant governor. In the primary, he received more votes than his opponents, J. E. Wise and B. F. Wright, but a newly enacted election law required a <b>runoff</b> if no candidate received a majority. On September 7, Johnson defeated Wise in the <b>runoff.</b>|$|E

5|$|In March 2016, Jones filed {{to run for}} Georgia House of Representatives, {{this time}} in District SH 091, an open seat vacated by Dee Dawkins Haigler {{to run for the}} Georgia State Senate. In the May 2016 Democratic primary election, Jones came within sixty votes of an {{outright}} victory, but was forced into a <b>runoff</b> election with Rhonda Taylor. Jones won the July <b>runoff</b> election and in November 2016, once again won election to the Georgia House, defeating Republican Carl Anuszczyk.|$|E
50|$|Farley first {{qualified}} for the SCCA National Championship <b>Runoffs</b> in 1978 in the Formula Vee class. After three attempts in Formula Vee, Farley graduated into Formula Continental in 1980. Farley won the SCCA Midwest Division National championship Formula Continental class in a Zink Z14. At the <b>Runoffs</b> Farley raced an Argo JM2 Volkswagen, former Formula Super Vee, car. Farley passed polesitter Phil Rosette to win his only <b>Runoffs</b> national championship.|$|R
25|$|All the Long {{candidates}} were nominated outright in the 1956 primary. There were no <b>runoffs</b> because Louisiana {{law at the}} time provided for <b>runoffs</b> for lesser constitutional offices, including lieutenant governor, only if there was also to be a second gubernatorial primary.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the election, Republicans held 22 {{seats in}} the Louisiana Senate, while Democrats held 17. In the jungle primary, the Republicans gained a net of two Senate seats, giving them 24 seats to the Democrats' 15 seats. All four <b>runoffs</b> were intraparty <b>runoffs.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the July 15, 2008 Democratic primary election, Jones won a {{plurality}} of votes in the Democratic primary. However, Georgia law requires a majority; if no majority is reached by a candidate, the two top vote-getters must face {{one another in a}} <b>runoff.</b> On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the run-off election to Jim Martin by a margin of 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost to Martin in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support within the black community before the <b>runoff</b> election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head match up against Martin. The black turnout in the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial primary election, further hurting Vernon Jones' chances in the <b>runoff.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} {{retreat of}} glaciers {{will have a}} number of different quantitative effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water <b>runoff</b> from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate <b>runoff.</b> A reduction in <b>runoff</b> will affect the ability to irrigate crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt. Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier <b>runoff</b> is important for hydropower.|$|E
5|$|There are {{floods in}} the summer from July to September, with about 17% of the annual <b>runoff</b> flowing in September.|$|E

5|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} types of soils by levels of permeability and <b>runoff</b> potential in the Buffalo Creek watershed. These are rated from A to D, with A-type soils having {{the highest level of}} permeability and lowest <b>runoff</b> potential and D having the lowest level of permeability and highest <b>runoff</b> potential. C-type soils are the most common, and occur in the eastern and central parts of the watershed. B-type soils primarily occur {{in the western part of}} the watershed. D-type soils are scattered throughout the watershed and A-type soils occur in areas of the southern and southeastern parts of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rise}} of sea levels that {{occurred}} during the Pleistocene approximately 17,000years ago, the <b>runoff</b> of water from Lake Okeechobee slowed and created the vast marshland that is now known as the Everglades. Slower <b>runoff</b> also created an accumulation of almost 18 feet (5.5 m) of peat in the area. The presence of such peat deposits, dated to about 5,000years ago, is evidence that widespread flooding had occurred by then.|$|E
5|$|A drain {{near the}} {{northeast}} corner of Pyramid B3 carries <b>runoff</b> rainwater from the Group B plaza and channels it outside the retaining wall to the area between Groups B and D.|$|E
30|$|Time {{series of}} all <b>runoffs</b> were {{estimated}} using the coefficients determined by Nakada et al. ([2012 a]) and summed to derive the total discharge from all watersheds. The robust time {{series of the}} total discharge (Figure  6 e) clearly showed seasonal maxima around late April, in the snowmelt period. The interannual variations of snowmelt <b>runoffs</b> were also visible and indicated that the largest snowmelt <b>runoffs</b> occurred in 2010. The maximum freshwater loading to Funka Bay occurred when the discharge was 300 to 600  m 3  s− 1 around late April.|$|R
50|$|In {{the open}} primary, Democrats won a {{guaranteed}} 45 seats: 34 outright, with 11 <b>runoffs</b> between two Democrats. Republicans won a guaranteed 42 seats: 30 outright, with 12 <b>runoffs</b> between two Republicans. One independent was also elected. The remaining 17 seats went to <b>runoffs,</b> including 16 between a Democrat and a Republican and one between a Democrat and an Independent. Democrats and Republicans each won eight of these seats, {{with the last}} going to an Independent, giving the Democrats a slim 53 to 50, with two Independents, majority in the House of Representatives.|$|R
50|$|Zink also {{competed in}} the highly popular Formula Ford category. Bruce MacInnes won two {{consecutive}} <b>Runoffs</b> pole positions in 1975 and 1976. MacInnes finished second in 1975 and suffered a penalty in 1976 preventing his win. Dave Weitzenhof won the <b>Runoffs</b> in the Formula Ford class in 1977 finishing in front of David Loring and Dennis Firestone driving a Zink Z-10. The Z-10 was the first car designed by Zink but manufactured by Citation Engineering. Weitzenhof also ran the Zink Z-16 Formula Ford winning the <b>Runoffs</b> in 1981.|$|R
5|$|Agricultural <b>runoff</b> from {{farms and}} ranches in the Snake River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of the}} river throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation {{in the first decade of}} the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to pollute the Snake. <b>Runoff</b> from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its oxygen supply.|$|E

5|$|Certain solids are {{selenium}}-rich, and selenium can be bioconcentrated by some plants. In soils, selenium {{most often}} occurs in soluble forms such as selenate (analogous to sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by <b>runoff.</b> Ocean water contains {{significant amounts of}} selenium.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, {{was delayed}} {{for nearly three}} decades to {{property}} disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and their business, elsewhere, leaving a ghost town in its wake. The proposed alignment ran through land {{where much of the}} state's cranberry harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt <b>runoff</b> from winter ice removal would harm cranberry harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control storm water <b>runoff</b> and avoid potential damage to the cranberry crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used {{along the length of the}} freeway that would divert <b>runoff</b> away from the Wareham River basin. In addition, the freeway was planned with a thicker asphalt pavement that was largely impervious to water.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{structures}} {{constructed on}} fill consisting of pyritic Marcellus shale has {{been caused by}} expansion from sulfuric acid(H2SO4) <b>runoff</b> reacting with the calcite(CaCO3) in the shale to produce gypsum(CaSO4), which has double the molar volume.|$|E
