5|$|However, {{once on the}} bus, Lisa {{realizes she}} is on the wrong bus and is dropped off in the middle of nowhere. During his lunch break at work, Homer has a {{conversation}} with Lenny and Carl. He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out the error of his judgment, and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it <b>rolls</b> <b>down</b> a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E
5|$|Homer is {{relaxing}} on a Saturday when Marge {{tells him}} {{that he should be}} doing work around the house and yard. Homer overcomes his reluctance and takes Bart to Mom & Pop Hardware to get some equipment. But while there, Homer sees a do it yourself barbecue pit and is compelled to buy it instead of anything that might help him with his work. Homer tries to install the pit, but bungles the job when he drops the parts of the barbecue into wet cement. He frantically tries to assemble the barbecue pit before the cement hardens, but only makes things worse. In the end, Homer is left with a mismatched collection of parts stuck in hardened cement, which angers him. He vents his rage on the construct, mangling it further. Later, Homer takes the results of his work back to the store for a refund, which he does not receive. On the way home, Homer loses control of the wagon containing the jumbled mess of concrete and bricks. It <b>rolls</b> <b>down</b> the highway and crashes into a woman's car, wrecking it. Homer flees the scene of the accident, but the woman tracks him down. It turns out that she is an artist named Astrid Weller (voiced by Isabella Rossellini), and sees Homer's handiwork as being a masterpiece of outsider art. Homer's exhibit goes to the Louvre: American Style museum and when Mr. Burns buys his work, Homer becomes a success.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake <b>rolls</b> <b>down</b> the window of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} several {{works of}} classical music at a concert meant to feature music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. While the first is Mozart's String Quartet No.19 in C-Major, the second piece is String Sextet No.1 by Johannes Brahms. The rest of the episode was scored by Dennis McCarthy; [...] "Sarek" [...] {{was one of several}} episodes on which he worked. Story editor Ronald D. Moore thought that [...] "Sarek" [...] was better than [...] "Journey to Babel", and it allowed Lenard to do some [...] "solid acting". Director Les Landau also praised Lenard's performance, saying that a moment when a tear <b>rolls</b> <b>down</b> Sarek's face was portrayed as [...] "something special". He added that the dynamics in the mind meld scene reached [...] "a level that I think is classic in Star Trek history", describing Stewart's performance as [...] "truly spectacular". The mind meld scene was shot in a single take.|$|E

As the song progresses, she walks out of the bus in the rain, holding an umbrella. She walks out of the parking lot and into an amusement park, where she stands in front of a carousel in the rain as she continues to sing. After the second chorus, Lovato and her band perform in the rain with the water altering colors in the background. As the last verse approaches, she is back on the tour bus.

500|$|... "Soft Light" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a [...] "B–" [...] {{and noted that}} the episode [...] "gains points for the obscure subject matter" [...] but [...] "loses them for the strained conspiratorial element". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club also gave it a [...] "B–". He praised the cold open for its strangeness and X's involvement, but thought that the explanation for Banton's shadow was not satisfactorily fleshed out. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the episode's case, calling it one wherein [...] "Mulder and Scully get to investigate properly, coming up with theories that they later build on or retract." [...] Shearman and Pearson also wrote positively of the episode's conclusion, noting that [...] "there's no better illustration for distrusting the government than the brilliant closing scene" [...] which features Shalhoub [...] "fixed to a chair, bombarded with flashes of light, as one single tear <b>rolls</b> <b>down</b> his terrified face." [...] Other reviews were decidedly more critical. John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 5 out of 10 and wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode falls short due to a completely ludicrous central concept, only partially countered by an interesting resolution highlighting the more sinister side of Informant X. Much like last season’s final few episodes, this season is ending with plenty of hints that Mulder and Scully are pushing the wrong buttons." ...|$|E

Method Man was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana, criminal possession of marijuana, DWI, and driving an uninspected motor vehicle. He reached a plea agreement to perform community service including rapping to young kids about the dangers of drugs.|$|E
2500|$|This {{kinematic}} description makes {{a number}} of simplifying assumptions since it neglects forces. [...] For one, it assumes that the rolling resistance is zero. [...] A wheelset (not attached to a train or truck), is given a push forward on a straight and level track. [...] The wheelset starts coasting and never slows down {{since there are no}} forces (except downward forces on the wheelset to make it adhere to the track and not slip). [...] If initially the wheelset is centered on the railroad track then the effective diameters of each wheel are the same and the wheelset <b>rolls</b> <b>down</b> the track in a perfectly straight line forever. [...] But if the wheelset is a little off-center so that the effective diameters (or radii) are different, then the wheelset starts to move in a curve of Radius R (depending on these wheelset radii, etc.; to be derived later on). [...] The problem is to use kinematic reasoning to find the trajectory of the wheelset, or more precisely, the trajectory of the center of the wheelset projected vertically on the roadbed {{in the center of the}} track. [...] This is a trajectory on the plane of the level earth's surface and plotted on an x-y graphical plot where x is the distance along the railroad and y is the [...] "tracking error", the deviation of the center of the wheelset from the straight line of the railway running down the center of the track (midway between the two rails).|$|E
