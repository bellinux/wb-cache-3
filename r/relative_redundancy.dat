40|$|Coiled-coil motifs are {{elements}} of protein structure, which, whilst based on relatively simple sequences, form {{a variety of}} structures and perform various functions in biology. The subtleties in coiled-coil sequences that lead to this diversity are not yet comprehensively understood. This thesis aims to explore these relationships by putting in place of relational database of coiled-coil structures and sequences. To this end coiled-coil motifs were identified from the POB using the SOCKET algorithm. The identified assignments were collated and organized into the CC+ tool set, and this was used to study various contemporary issues in coiled-coil research. CC+ comprises an organized file system of data made during coiled-coil assignments, and a subset of these data was parsed into a relational database. The relational database facilitates searching coiled-coil data sets for motifs of specific topologies, configurations and composition. Using the tool set, compiling data sets of specific coiled-coil data {{is no longer a}} laborious manual undertaking, but a simple and speedy process conducted in real time. This process was further enhanced with the implementation of an on-line interface; the web site facilitates interrogation of the tool set, visualization of the coiled-coil assignments returned from the database, and exporting data for further study elsewhere. The tool set was used to study several aspects of coiled-coil sequence-to-structure relationships. Searches performed on amino-acid interactions occurring within the hydrophobic interface of antiparallel, 2 -helix coiled coils yielded hypotheses consistent with the findings of an independent experimental system. Networks of polar interactions incorporating as- paragine and an ion ligand within the hydrophobia interface of 3 -helix coiled coils have also been observed and studied. Throughout these studies, it was apparent that many coiled-coil assignments within the tool set are either exact duplicates, or redundant due to the highly repetitive nature of identified coiled-coil sequences. Therefore, algorithms were developed to determine the <b>relative</b> <b>redundancies</b> of different aspect of coiled-coil structure, and these are incorporated dynamically into web-based searching {{to improve the quality of}} the data sets returned. Numerous algorithms exist to predict the formation of coiled-coil structure using amino-acid sequences, and these are based on specific amino-acid compositions recorded from manually compiled data sets. It is hoped that the CC+ tool set will facilitate refinement of existing coiled-coil prediction algorithms by contributing updated data sets, and even contribute in the creation of more accurate prediction methods in future. Furthermore, specific amino- acid interactions within coiled-coil systems have been investigated, and conclusions made regarding their effect on coiled-coil stability, illustrating the tool set's potential in facilitating de novo design of novel coiled-coil interactions.

40|$|International audienceReal {{uncertainties}} in the parameter {{values of}} conceptual models used in hydrology sometimes remain after calibration. While this is unacceptable, uncertainty analysis can provide useful {{information on the}} structural properties of the model. This information may then be used to modify the model or establish the limits of usefulness of the measured data. This paper focuses on the estimation and interpretation of the parameter uncertainties in such cases. The standard estimation method, based on the second-order approximation of {{the shape of the}} objective function {{in the vicinity of the}} optimum parameter set, provides an inaccurate description of these uncertainties. Instead a global approach, consisting of scanning the hypercube of the possible parameter values, is shown to give a good overview of these uncertainties. This gives not only a good general view of the shape of the objective function, but a good basis for interpretation as well. The efficiency of the method is illustrated using a four parameter urban stormwater quality model. The main conclusion is that the lack of measured data and its <b>relative</b> <b>redundancy</b> cause a significant interaction between the parameters, hindering calibration.

Relative abundances of the dinocyst species show distinct regional differences allowing the separation of four hydrographic regimes. (1) In the area off Cape Ghir, which is characterized by most seasonal upwelling and river discharge, Lingulodinium machaerophorum strongly dominates the associations which are additionally characterized by cysts of Gymnodinium nolleri, cysts of Polykrikos kofoidii and cysts of Polykrikos schwartzii. (2) Off Cape Yubi, a region with increasing perennial upwelling, L. machaerophorum, Brigantedinium spp., species of the genus Impagidinium and cysts of Protoperidinium stellatum occur in highest relative abundances. (3) In coastal samples between Cape Ghir and Cape Yubi, Gymnodinium catenatum, species of the genus Impagidinium, Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus, Operculodinium centrocarpum, cysts of P. stellatum and Selenopemphix nephroides determine the species composition. (4) Off Cape Blanc, where upwelling prevails perennially, and at offshore sites, heterotrophic dinocyst species show highest <b>relative</b> abundances. A <b>Redundancy</b> Analysis reveals fluvial mud, sea surface temperature {{and the depth of}} the mixed layer in boreal spring (spring) as the most important parameters relating to the dinocyst species association.

Highest accumulation rates with up to almost 80. 000 cysts cm**- 2 ky**- 1 were found off Cape Ghir and Cape Yubi reflecting their eutrophic upwelling filaments. A Redundancy Analysis gives evidence that primary productivity and the input of fluvial mud are mostly related to the dinocyst association. By means of accumulation rate data, quantitative cyst production of individual species can be considered independently {{from the rest of the}} association, allowing autecological interpretations.

Differences in {{the timing of the}} peaks in phytoplankton and zooplankton populations occur due to a mismatch between primary production and grazing. Using an inverse approach based on in situ experimental data, an ecological network analysis was carried out to characterize emergent properties of the food web and to estimate carbon flows. The data set was composed of rate measurements for net primary production, import and export of dissolved organic carbon, and grazing of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates by metazoan micro- and mesozooplankton. Ecological network analysis indices were calculated on the estimated fluxes and compared to values from plankton models built with exactly the same method. The largest activities in the resulting model came from the nano- and microphytoplankton. The detritivory/herbivory ratio, the recycling rates and the <b>relative</b> <b>redundancy</b> of the system were very low compared to other planktonic systems, even in similar periods of bloom.

Using a theoretical framework that combines elements of Marxism and Practice Theory, it aims at defining archaeological correlates for Andean pastoralism and caravan traffic, identifying ways in which the material remains of these activities can be used to explore aspects of the political economy in which they were immersed. Pastoral settlement systems include a minimum of four settings where traces of this activity could potentially be found; these are termed main residences, herding posts, grazing areas, and gathering places. Caravan settlement systems involve six, i. e., caravanners' residences, routes, overnight stops, rest places, articulation points, and extractive loci. Each one of these settings is analyzed in terms of activities, location, artifact content, internal organization, and medium-term processes that condition the <b>relative</b> <b>redundancy</b> in their use. The principles that regulate the organization of behavior and its their material residues in these contexts are discussed, extracting several general propositions that could serve to identify the archaeological record of prehistoric pastoralism and caravan traffic. These remains could also provide important information regarding six variables that are crucial to understand the role of caravan trade in broader social and economic processes: degree of pastoral specialization of caravanners; goods transported; elites' involvement in traffic; ethnic context of trade; geopolitical context of trade; and network configuration...|$|E

Knowledge of CDOM optical properties and spatial discrepancy based {{on the relationship between}} water quality and spectral parameters in the Yinma River watershed with in situ data collected from highly polluted waters are exhibited in this study. Based on the comprehensive index method, the riverine waters showed serious contamination; especially the chemical oxygen demand (COD), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), mercury (Hg) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were out of range of the contamination warning. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total suspended matter (TSM) with prominent non-homogenizing were significantly high in the riverine waters, but chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was the opposite. The ternary phase diagram showed that non-algal particle absorption {{played an important role in}} total non-water light absorption (> 50 %) in most sampling locations, and mean contributions of CDOM were 13 % and 22 % in the summer and autumn, respectively. The analysis of the ratio of absorption at 250 – 365 nm (E 250 : 365) and the spectral slope (S 275 – 295) indicated that CDOM had higher aromaticity and molecular weight in autumn than in summer, which is consistent with the results of water quality and the CDOM <b>relative</b> contribution rate. <b>Redundancy</b> analysis (RDA) indicated that the environmental variables OSM (Organic suspended matter) had a strong correlation with CDOM absorption, followed by heavy metals, e. g., Mn, Hg and Cr 6 +. However, for the specific UV absorbance (SUVA 254), the seasonal values showed opposite results compared with the reported literature. The potential reasons were that more UDOM (uncolored dissolved organic matter) from human sources (wastewater effluent) existed in the waters. Terrigenous inputs simultaneously are in relation to the aCDOM(440) -DOC relationship with the correlation coefficient of 0. 90 in the summer (two-tailed, p < 0. 01), and 0. 58 in the autumn (two-tailed, p < 0. 05). Spatial distribution of the CDOM parameters exhibited that the downstream regions focused on dry land have high CDOM molecular weight and aromatic hydrocarbon. Partial sampling locations around the cities or countries generally showed abnormal values due to terrigenous inputs. As a bio-optical model parameter, the spectral characteristic of CDOM is helpful in adjusting the derived algorithms in highly polluted environments.

The Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) approach was used to model the trophic flows in 6 spatial compartments leading to 6 distinct EwE models: the navigation channel and the two channel flanks in the estuary proper, and 3 marine habitats in the eastern Seine Bay. Each model included 12 consumer groups, 2 primary producers, and one detritus group. Ecological {{network analysis}} was performed, including a set of indices, keystoneness, and trophic spectrum analysis to describe {{the contribution of the}} 6 habitats to the Seine estuary ecosystem functioning. Results showed that the two habitats with a functioning most related to a stressed state were the northern and central navigation channels, where building works and constant maritime traffic are considered major anthropogenic stressors. The strong top-down control highlighted in the other 4 habitats was not present in the central channel, showing instead (i) a change in keystone roles in the ecosystem towards sediment-based, lower trophic levels, and (ii) a higher system omnivory. The southern channel evidenced the highest system activity (total system throughput), the higher trophic specialisation (low system omnivory), and the lowest indication of stress (low cycling and <b>relative</b> <b>redundancy).</b> Marine habitats showed higher fish biomass proportions and higher transfer efficiencies per trophic levels than the estuarine habitats, with a transition area between the two that presented intermediate ecosystem structure. The modelling of separate habitats permitted disclosing each one's response to the different pressures, based on their a priori knowledge. Network indices, although non-monotonously, responded to these differences and seem a promising operational tool to define the ecological status of transitional water ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{physiological}} and pathological observations cannot readily be explained unless one accepts that there exists within the testis {{some sort of}} local control system. This local network of regulatory interactions offers not only an additional level of fine regulation for individual testicular functions, but also creates an opportunity for co-ordination and integration of distinct activities such as germ cell development and androgen production. There is an overwhelming amount of data indicating that the testis produces a variety of regulatory molecules and {{that many of these}} agonists have marked effects on the function of testicular cells in vitro. Some of these molecules are identical with or are at least related to known hormonal and humoral agonists. Others are novel and require further characterization. The exact cellular origin of many of these regulatory factors remains unknown. This overview has been limited to regulatory interactions between somatic testicular cells. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} communications between the interstitial and the tubular compartment. It should be evident that the nature and the significance of these interactions is only beginning to emerge. The major difficulty remains to distinguish effects that are restricted to the specific and often artificial conditions of in vitro systems from phenomena that are relevant to testicular control in vivo. Further progress in this field will rely on the development of appropriate systems to study local interactions in vivo. Valuable attempts have been made in this direction: vitamin A induced synchronization of spermatogenesis may offer a model to study stage dependent alterations in the interstitial compartment (Morales and Griswold, 1987; Bartlett et al, 1989); destruction of Leydig cells followed by substitution with androgens might clarify the role of non-steroidal Leydig cell mediators on tubular function (Shape et al, 1988). Up to now these approaches have failed to demonstrate an important role for local regulatory interactions. It is obvious that both models are relatively crude, however, and that subtle changes may have been missed under the experimental conditions used. It should be stressed that some of the observed complexities may be inherent to local regulatory networks. In fact, such networks tend to display a certain level of redundancy. It is evident, for example, that a number of locally produced mediators can also reach the testis via the circulation. In this setting the relative contribution of circulating and locally produced factors may vary depending on developmental stages, physiological or pathological conditions. A <b>relative</b> <b>redundancy</b> may exist for distinct locally produced mediators. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Periodontal disease (PD) is {{characterized}} by the inflammatory bone resorption in response to the bacterial challenge, in a host response that involves a series of chemokines supposed to control cell influx into periodontal tissues and determine disease outcome. In this study, we investigated the role of chemokines and its receptors in the immunoregulation of experimental PD in mice. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-infected C 57 BI/ 6 (WT) mice developed an intense inflammatory reaction and severe alveolar bone resorption, associated with a high expression of CCL 3 and the migration of CCR 5 +, CCR 1 + and RANKL+ cells to periodontal tissues. However, CCL 3 KO-infected mice developed a similar disease phenotype than WT strain, characterized by the similar expression of cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL- 10), osteoclastogenic factors (RANKL and OPG) and MMPs (MMP- 1, MMP- 2, MMP- 3, TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 3), and similar patterns of CCR 1 +, CCR 5 + and RANKL+ cell migration. The apparent lack of function for CCL 3 is possible due the <b>relative</b> <b>redundancy</b> of chemokine system, since chemokines such as CCL 4 and CCL 5, which share the receptors CCR 1 and CCR 5 with CCL 3, present a similar kinetics of expression than CCL 3. Accordingly, CCL 4 and CCL 5 kinetics of expression after experimental periodontal infection remain unaltered regardless the presence/absence of CCL 3. Conversely, the individual absence of CCR 1 and CCR 5 resulted in a decrease of leukocyte infiltration and alveolar bone loss. When CCR 1 and CCR 5 were simultaneously inhibited by met-RANTES treatment a significantly more effective attenuation of periodontitis progression was verified, associated with lower values of bone loss and decreased counts of leukocytes in periodontal tissues. Our results suggest that the absence of CCL 3 does not affect the development of experimental PD in mice, probably due to the presence of homologous chemokines CCL 4 and CCL 5 that overcome the absence of this chemokine. In addition, our data demonstrate that the absence of chemokine receptors CCR 1 + and CCR 5 + attenuate of inflammatory bone resorption. Finally, our data shows data the simultaneous blockade of CCR 1 and CCR 5 with MetRANTEs presents a more pronounced effect in the arrest of disease progression, demonstrating the cooperative role of such receptors in the inflammatory bone resorption process throughout experimental PD.

40|$|Animals must {{coordinate}} {{development with}} fluctuating nutrient availability. Nutrient availability governs post-embryonic development in Caenorhabditis elegans: larvae that hatch {{in the absence}} of food do not initiate post-embryonic development but enter "L 1 arrest" (or "L 1 diapause") and can survive starvation for weeks, while rapidly resume normal development once get fed. Insulin-like signaling (IIS) {{has been shown to be}} a key regulator of L 1 arrest and recovery. However, the C. elegans genome encodes 40 insulin-like peptides (ILPs), and it is unknown which peptides participate in nutritional control of L 1 arrest and recovery. Work in other contexts has identified putative receptor agonists and antagonists, but the extent of specificity versus redundancy is unclear beyond this distinction. We measured mRNA expression dynamics with high temporal resolution for all 40 insulin-like genes during entry into and recovery from L 1 arrest. Nutrient availability influences expression of the majority of insulin-like genes, with variable dynamics suggesting complex regulation. We identified 13 candidate agonists and 8 candidate antagonists based on expression in response to nutrient availability. We selected ten candidate agonists (daf- 28, ins- 3, ins- 4, ins- 5, ins- 6, ins- 7, ins- 9, ins- 26, ins- 33 and ins- 35) for further characterization in L 1 stage larvae. We used destabilized reporter genes to determine spatial expression patterns. Expression of candidate agonists was largely overlapping in L 1 stage larvae, suggesting a role of the intestine, chemosensory neurons ASI and ASJ, and the interneuron PVT in systemic control of L 1 development. Transcriptional regulation of candidate agonists was most significant in the intestine, as if nutrient uptake was a more important influence on transcription than sensory perception. Scanning in the 5 ' upstream promoter region of these 40 ILPs, We found that transcription factor PQM- 1 and GATA putative binding sites are depleted in the promoter region of antagonists. A novel motif was also found to be over-represented in ILPs. Phenotypic analysis of single and compound deletion mutants did not reveal effects on L 1 recovery/developmental dynamics, though simultaneous disruption of ins- 4 and daf- 28 extended survival of L 1 arrest without enhancing thermal tolerance, while overexpression of ins- 4, ins- 6 or daf- 28 shortened L 1 survival. Simultaneous disruption of several ILPs showed a temperature independent, transient dauer phenotype. These results revealed the <b>relative</b> <b>redundancy</b> and specificity among agonistic ILPs. TGF- &# 946; and steroid hormone (SH) signaling have been reported to control the dauer formation along with IIS. Our preliminary results suggest they may also mediate the IIS control of L 1 arrest and recovery, as the expression of several key components of TGF-&# 946; and SH signaling pathway genes are negatively regulated by DAF- 16, and loss-of-function of these genes partially represses daf- 16 null phenotype in L 1 arrest, and causes a retardation in L 1 development. In summary, my dissertation study focused on the IIS, characterized the dynamics and sites of ILPs expression in response to nutrient availability, revealed the function of specific agonistic ILPs in L 1 arrest, and suggested potential cross-regulation among IIS, TGF-&# 946; signaling and SH signaling in controlling L 1 arrest and recovery. These findings provide insights into how post-embryonic development is governed by insulin-like signaling and nutrient availability. Dissertatio...|$|E
