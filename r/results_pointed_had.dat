A Fujifilm consumer grade 3 D camera provides a highly mobile and low-cost 3 D capture device. Applying standard computer vision algorithms, camera calibration is performed, the captured images are stereo rectified, and the depth information is computed by block matching. Due to technical limitations, the <b>resulting</b> <b>point</b> cloud <b>has</b> defects such as splotches and noise, which {{make it hard to}} recover the precise 3 D locations of the points on the book pages. We address this problem by computing curve profiles of the depth map and using them to build a cylinder model of the pages. We then employ meshes to facilitate the flattening and rendering of the cylinder model in virtual space. We have implemented a prototype of the system and report on a preliminary evaluation based on measuring the straightness of resulting text lines.

40|$|Fluid-structure {{interactions}} {{appear in}} many industrial {{applications in the}} field of energy technology. As the components are more and more pushed to higher performance, taking fluid-structure interaction phenomena into account has a great impact on the design {{as well as in the}} cost and safety. Internal flows related to propulsion systems in aerodynamics area are of our interest; and particularly aeroelasticity and flutter phenomena. A new 2 D flexible generic model, so called bump, based on previous studies at the division of Heat and Power Technology about fluid-structure interactions is here presented. The overall goal is to enhance comprehension of flutter phenomenon. The current study exposes a preliminary experimental campaign regarding mechanical behaviour on two different test objects: an existing one made of polyurethane and a new one of aluminium. The setup is built in such a way that it allows the bumps to oscillate until 500 Hz. The objective is to reach this frequency range by remaining in the first bending mode shape which is indeed considered as fundamental for flutter study. In this manner being as close as possible to the bending flutter configuration in high-subsonic and transonic flows will provide a deeper understanding of the shock wave boundary layer interaction and the force phase angle related to it. The <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>pointed</b> out that the bumps can reach a frequency of 250 Hz by remaining in the first bending mode shape. The one in polyurethane can even reach frequency up to 350 Hz; however, amplitude is higher than the theoretical one fixed to 0. 5 mm.
