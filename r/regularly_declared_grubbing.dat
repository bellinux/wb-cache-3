30|$|The {{proposed}} detection framework {{allows a}} VM to <b>regularly</b> <b>declare</b> its current application metrics, which enables the hypervisor to correlate these metrics {{with the actual}} resources load and decide if it is coherent or not (compromised VM trying to claim and consume more resources).

Moreover, the VM may lie about its current metrics either because of its selfish strategy (in order to obtain more resources) or because the VM has been compromised.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} and proliferation of personal computers using the CP/M operating {{system in the}} late 1970s, and later DOS-based systems starting in 1981, meant that many sites grew to dozens or even hundreds of computers. The initial driving force for networking was generally to share storage and printers, which were both expensive at the time. There was much enthusiasm for the concept and for several years, from about 1983 onward, computer industry pundits would <b>regularly</b> <b>declare</b> the coming year to be, “The year of the LAN”.|$|R
50|$|Clients {{quickly found}} out about Checkpoint and {{this meant that the}} low-threshold walk-in clinic soon had to be abandoned.

Recognition came in 2004 when, at the 15th World AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Checkpoint was able to demonstrate that the rapid HIV test in the Netherlands lowered the threshold for MSM to have themselves tested, which meant that the second of Checkpoint's two aims had been realized.|$|R
40|$|Its {{impact on}} workers {{in all three}} nations Each year since the {{implementation}} of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have <b>regularly</b> <b>declared</b> the agreement to be an unqualified success. It has been promoted as an economic free lunch—a “win-win-win ” for all three countries that should now be extended {{to the rest of the}} hemisphere in a Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement. For some people, NAFTA clearly has been a success. This should not be a surprise inasmuch as it was designed to bring extraordinary government protections to a specific set of interests—investors and financiers in all three countries who search for cheaper labor and production costs. From that perspective, increased gross volumes of trade and financial flows in themselves testify to NAFTA’s achievements. But most citizens of North America do not support themselves on their investments. They work for a living. The overwhelming majority has less than a college education, has little leverage in bargaining with employers, and requires a certain degree of job security in order to achieve a minimal, decent level of living. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. This imbalance inevitably undercut the hard-won social contract in all three nations...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lupine allergy {{is caused}} by {{ingestion}} of the flour of a plant called Lupinus albus, {{a member of the}} Leguminosae family. Lupine allergy has been described in adult patients previously known to have peanut allergy (cross-reactivity). OBJECTIVE: To describe the first case of an anaphylactic reaction caused by ingestion of lupine flour in a pediatric patient without a known peanut allergy. METHODS: Symptom assessment, nutritional history, and skin and blood tests. RESULTS: An otherwise healthy 8 -year-old boy had nose and eye discharge followed by facial edema and difficulty breathing 30 minutes after eating an industrially prepared waffle containing eggs, sugar, and lupine flour. He had no history of food allergy and was eating a normal diet, including peanuts and other legumes. Results of skin prick tests using commercial extracts were positive to peanuts and negative to eggs, soy, and nuts; results of a prick-to-prick test using lupine flour were strongly positive (+ + + +). His total IgE level was 1, 237 UI/mL. Specific IgE antibodies were positive to lupine seeds (20. 8 kU/L) and peanuts (&gt; 100 kU/L). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, we describe the first case of an anaphylactic reaction after ingestion of lupine flour in a child without known allergy. In the case of peanut allergy or any anaphylactic reaction without evident cause, especially after industrially prepared food ingestion, lupine should be considered in the list of allergens tested. Lupine is increasingly used in industrially prepared food but is not <b>regularly</b> <b>declared</b> in the composition, leading to difficulties in allergen avoidance...|$|R
40|$|In the mid- 1970 s, Judith Shklar began {{teaching}} an undergraduate course entitled 2 ̆ 2 American Political Thought 2 ̆ 2 at Harvard. I {{was the second}} 2 ̆ 2 grader 2 ̆ 2 she chose for it. (The first was William Kristol, later Vice President Dan Quayle 2 ̆ 7 s Chief of Staff.) Shklar 2 ̆ 7 s interest in teaching the subject surprised many, including me. She had been raised, after all, largely in the Baltics and Canada, with several European locations in between, as her family sought distance from Stalin and Hitler. She was {{best known for her}} writings on European political thinkers, especially Rousseau and Hegel. And the field of American political thought was then largely disdained in political science, as empiricists focused on behavior while theorists <b>regularly</b> <b>declared</b> that worthwhile American political philosophy had begun and ended with the Federalist Papers. That perception was so widespread that I somewhat resisted her encouragement of my own interests in the field, suspecting it reflected her silent judgment that more profound European thinkers were best left to others. But in fact, it was Shklar 2 ̆ 7 s belief in the importance of American political thought that was profound. The subject would be increasingly featured in her publications, including portions of her 1990 book, The Faces of Injustice; her 1990 presidential address as the first female head of the American Political Science Association; and her final works, American Citizenship: The Quest for Inclusion and The Bill of Rights and the Liberal Tradition. American thought, including a study of Jefferson, was also central to the typically ambitious writing agenda she had planned when a heart attack ended her distinguished career prematurely in September, 1992. Her abiding fascination with the American revolutionaries, in particular, is vividly apparent in her eloquent draft review of Gordon Wood 2 ̆ 7 s The Radicalism of the American Revolution, which follows. In it, she cheerfully employs Wood 2 ̆ 7 s book as a vehicle to make some of her favorite points from her undergraduate lectures...|$|R

40|$|A {{range of}} {{preventive}} practices are recommended {{to reduce the}} burden of chronic diseases. The aim of our study was to describe the preventive practices of French-speaking primary care physicians. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2015 in a randomly selected sample of 1100 primary care physicians (700 in Switzerland, 400 in France). The physicians were asked how often they performed the following recommended preventive practices: blood pressure, weight and height measurements, screening for dyslipidemia, screening for alcohol use and brief intervention, screening for smoking (and brief advice for smokers), colon and prostate cancer screening, and influenza immunization. Response options on the five points Likert scale were never, rarely, sometimes, often, always. The physicians {{were considered to be}} performing the preventive practice <b>regularly</b> if they <b>declared</b> performing it often or always. 518 participants (47 %) returned the questionnaire. The most commonly reported preventive practices were: blood pressure measurement (99 %), screening for smoking (95 %) and brief advice for smokers (95 %). The least frequently reported practices were annual influenza immunization for at-risk patients < 65 years (37 %), height measurement (53 %), screening for excessive alcohol use (60 %) and brief advice for at-risk drinkers (67 %). All other practices were reported by 70 to 90 % of participants. Whereas some preventive practices now appear to be part of primary care routine, others were not applied by a large proportion of primary care physicians in our study. Further studies should explore whether these findings are related to miss-knowledge of common guidelines, or other implementation barriers in this primary care context...|$|R
60|$|In {{executing}} this plan, {{negotiations were}} first cautiously opened with the Guards, and they readily acceded to the proposals made to them. A committee of three persons {{was appointed to}} draw up the address to Sophia, and the precise details of the movements which were to {{take place on the}} arrival of the Guards at the gates of Moscow were all arranged. The Guards, of course, required some pretext for leaving their posts and coming toward the city, independent of the real cause, for the conspirators within the city were not prepared to rise and declare the throne vacant until the Guards had actually arrived. Accordingly, while the conspirators remained quiet, the Guards began to complain of various grievances under which they suffered, particularly that they were not paid their wages <b>regularly,</b> and they <b>declared</b> their determination to march to Moscow and obtain redress. The government--that is, the regency that Peter had left in charge--sent out deputies, who attempted to pacify them, but could not succeed. The Guards insisted that they would go with their complaints to Moscow. They commenced their march. The number of men was about ten thousand. They pretended that they were only going to the city to represent their case themselves directly to the government, and then to march back again in a peaceable manner. They wished to know, too, they said, what had become of the Czar. They could not depend upon the rumors which came to them at so great a distance, and they were determined to inform themselves on the spot whether he were alive or dead, and when he was coming home.|$|R
