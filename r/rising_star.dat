40|$|Abstract. Identifying the <b>rising</b> <b>stars</b> is an {{important}} but difficult human resource exercise in all organizations. <b>Rising</b> <b>stars</b> are those who currently have relatively low profiles but may eventually emerge as prominent contributors to the organizations. In this paper, we propose a novel PubRank algorithm to identify <b>rising</b> <b>stars</b> in research communities by mining the social networks of researchers {{in terms of their}} co-authorship relationships. Experimental results show that PubRank algorithm can be used to effectively mine the bibliography networks to search for <b>rising</b> <b>stars</b> in the research communities...|$|R

Clearmountain, then a <b>rising</b> <b>star</b> {{in record}} production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but was certainly the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E

5|$|Edwards is a far-right {{political}} activist from Memphis, Tennessee, {{described by the}} Southern Poverty Law Center as a <b>rising</b> <b>star</b> of the modern white-nationalist movement. They write that he is articulate, charming, and at ease {{in front of the}} public, as well as in television and radio studios. He attended Briarcrest Christian School, a private school in Memphis, and in ninth grade transferred into a Christian-nationalist homeschooling program, a decision that he said led him into political activism. In 2000 he volunteered for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign, and in 2002 ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives. It was during this campaign that he met fellow activist Austin Farley, who was on the ballot against him. In October of that year, he and Farley established The Political Cesspool.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{frustrated}} with the perceived lack of success against RAF Fighter Command, Göring was keen on infusing the fighter force leadership with younger blood. He perceived a lack of aggressiveness in the Jagdgeschwader leadership. The likes of Theo Osterkamp were the first victim of this policy, handing over JG 51 to Werner Mölders. Oesau {{was considered to be}} one such <b>rising</b> <b>star.</b> However, being a star and staying in Göring's favor required keeping up the kill rate and promotions were invariably linked to scores. According to Dr. Kurt Tank, the Focke–Wulf designer, although many of the younger generation were good flyers, they were unable to cope with problems of overall planning and broader strategic aspects. However, Oesau was one of the outstanding leaders ever produced by Luftwaffe fighter wings with the likes of Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland.|$|E
5|$|In January 1956 Hope {{recorded}} with another <b>rising</b> <b>star,</b> Jackie McLean, for the saxophonist's Lights Out! In April {{of the same}} year Hope should have appeared on saxophonist Gene Ammons' The Happy Blues, but he left the record company's building before the session began and did not return. Hope claimed that he had gone to visit an aunt in hospital, but his absence was attributed by others to his heroin addiction. This had existed on and off for several years, and had led to at least one spell in prison. His drug problem and associated criminal record led to the withdrawal of Hope's New York City Cabaret Card around 1956, so he was no longer permitted to play in clubs in the city.|$|E
