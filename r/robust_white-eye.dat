Several birds have become extinct on the island since the arrival of humans. The first round of extinctions included the Lord Howe swamphen or white gallinule, white-throated pigeon, red-crowned parakeet and the Tasman booby, which were eliminated by visitors and settlers {{during the nineteenth century}} either from overhunting for food or protection of crops. Black rats were released from provisioning whaling ships in the 1840s and mice from Norfolk Island in 1860. In 1918 the black rat was accidentally introduced with the shipwreck of the SS Makambo which ran aground at Ned's Beach. This triggered a second wave of extinctions, including the vinous-tinted thrush, <b>robust</b> <b>white-eye,</b> Lord Howe starling, Lord Howe fantail and the Lord Howe gerygone as well as the destruction of the native phasmid and decimation of palm fruits. Bounties were offered for rat and pig tails and 'ratting' became a popular pursuit. Subsequent poisoning programs have kept populations low. The Lord Howe boobook may have become extinct through predation by, or competition with, the Tasmanian masked owls which were introduced in the 1920s in a failed attempt to control the rat population. Stray dogs are also a threat as they could harm the native wood hen and other birds.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>robust</b> <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops strenuus), {{also known}} as the Lord Howe white-eye or robust silvereye, and locally as the [...] "big grinnell", was a species of bird in the family Zosteropidae. It was endemic to the lowland forests of Lord Howe Island, east of Australia.|$|E
50|$|The {{fate of the}} Lord Howe {{starling}} {{was sealed}} in June 1918 when the SS Makambo grounded at Ned's Beach, thus allowing black rats to leave the vessel and overrun the island. Within two years 40% of Lord Howe's endemic bird species were extinct, including the Lord Howe fantail, Lord Howe gerygone, and <b>robust</b> <b>white-eye.</b> The Lord Howe starling vanished by 1919.|$|E
50|$|It was a mainly green bird, around 7.6 cm long, {{with a white}} {{belly and}} yellow throat, which {{separated}} it from other species of white-eye. The <b>robust</b> <b>white-eye</b> built loosely constructed, cup-shaped nests out of palm fibre and dried grasses, which were sometimes found in shrubs overgrown with vines. This made the species vulnerable to predation by black rats (Rattus rattus), which were accidentally introduced in 1918 following the grounding of the steamship SS Makambo on the island. Although once common, the bird was extinct by 1923.|$|E
5000|$|Problems {{with the}} rats {{led to an}} {{attempted}} ecological solution through the deliberate introduction of Tasmanian masked owls between 1922 and 1930 to the island, an action which compounded the disaster by adding another predator to the ecosystem. [...] Birds which became extinct soon after the arrival of rats include the Lord Howe Island thrush, Lord Howe gerygone, Lord Howe starling, Lord Howe fantail and <b>robust</b> <b>white-eye.</b> The Lord Howe boobook may have been eliminated by the introduced masked owls. Various seabirds were wiped out as breeding species on the main island, though they persist elsewhere. The giant Lord Howe Island stick insect also became extinct on the main island in 1930, and {{was believed to be}} completely gone until a tiny population of survivors was discovered on Ball's Pyramid in 2001 (there are plans to reintroduce them). Rats are also implicated in the population declines and extinctions of Lord Howe's endemic lizards, land snails and beetles.|$|E
