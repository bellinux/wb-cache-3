50|$|Pulsed {{electron}} paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a electron paramagnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>technique</b> {{that involves}} the alignment of the net magnetization vector of the electron spins in a constant magnetic field. This alignment is perturbed by applying a short oscillating field, usually a microwave pulse. One can then measure the emitted microwave signal which is created by the sample magnetization.

50|$|The special {{position}} of the brain during inanition (due to fasting or tumor disease) was already confirmed experimentally over 80 years ago: The body mass reduces, but {{the mass of the}} brain hardly reduces, if at all (see 3). Recently this axiom of the selfish brain theory was supported by work at the University of Luebeck involving state-of-the-art magnetic resonance procedures, e.g. during metabolic stress. The ATP content in the brain and musculature of test subjects was examined by a magnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>technique</b> while either an energy deficit or surplus was induced in the blood by insulin or glucose injection. In both situations a sufficiently high ATP-concentration was measured in the brain. The measured high-energy-rich substances changed throughout to the benefit of the brain and to the disadvantage of the body cells. The glucose-supply of the brain had priority despite the physical stress that was being endured (see 11).|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the major}} {{research}} today is done on finding better and more efficient ways to diagnose this disease. Many researchers have divided the MRIs of the brain into different sections or quadrants. A score is given to each section depending on how severe the white matter atrophy or leukoaraiosis is. Research {{has shown that the}} higher these scores, the more of a decrease in processing speed, executive functions, and motor learning tasks. Other researchers have begun using computers to calculate the percentage of white matter atrophy by counting the hyper-intense pixels of the MRI. These and similar reports show a correlation between the amount of white matter alterations and the decline of psychomotor functions, reduced performance on attention and executive control. One recent type of technology is called susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) which is a magnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>technique</b> which has an unusually high degree of sensitivity and can better detect white matter alternations.|$|E
50|$|Annular lipids (also called shell lipids or {{boundary}} lipids) {{represent a}} select set of lipids or lipidic molecules which preferentially bind or {{stick to the}} surface of membrane proteins in biological cells. They constitute a layer, or an annulus/ shell, of lipids which are highly immobilized due to the existence of strong lipid-protein (binding) interactions. Polar headgroups of these lipids bind to the hydrophilic part of the membrane protein(s) at the inner and outer surfaces of lipid bilayer membrane. The hydrophobic surface of the membrane proteins is bound to the apposed lipid fatty acid chains of the membrane bilayer. For integral membrane proteins spanning the thickness of the membrane bilayer, these annular/shell lipids act like a lubricating layer on the proteins' surfaces, thereby facilitating almost free rotation and lateral diffusion of membrane proteins within the 2-dimensional expanse of the biological membrane(s). Outside the layer of shell/annular lipids, lipids are not tied down to protein molecules. However, they may be slightly restricted in their segmental motion freedom due to mild peer pressure of protein molecules, if present in high concentration, which arises from extended influence of protein-lipid interaction. Membrane areas away from protein molecules contain lamellar phase bulk lipids, which are largely free from any restraining effects due to protein-lipid interactions. Thermal denaturation of membrane proteins may destroy the secondary and tertiary structure of membrane proteins, exposing newer surfaces to membrane lipids and therefore increasing the number of lipids molecules in the annulus/shell layer. This phenomenon can be studied by the spin label electron paramagnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>technique.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Klemperer’s {{early work}} {{concentrated}} on the infrared spectroscopy of small molecules that are only stable in the gas phase at high temperatures. Among these are the alkali halides, for many of which he obtained the first vibrational spectra. The work provided basic structural data for many oxides and fluorides, and gave remarkable insight {{into the details of}} the bonding. It also led Klemperer to recognize the immense potential of molecular beams in spectroscopy, and in particular the use of the electric <b>resonance</b> <b>technique</b> to address fundamental problems in structural chemistry. An important result was his benchmark measurement of the electric dipole moment of LiH,at a date when this was the largest molecule for which quantum chemical calculations had any hope of getting useful results in a sensible length of time. Klemperer has always been enthusiastic about molecular beams; he writes: “Molecular beams are fun for a chemist. They give one a sense of power." [...] An example of this is the use that Klemperer and his students made of electric deflection methods to determine the polarities of a number of high temperature species; the results were unexpected, and to everyone’s surprise it turned out that half the alkaline earth dihalides are polar,meaning that they cannot be symmetric linear molecules, contrary to the simple and widely taught models of ionic bonding. Klemperer also provided precise dipole moments of excited electronic states both by using the Stark effect in electronic spectra and by using electric resonance spectroscopy of metastable states of molecules. Klemperer introduced the technique of supersonic cooling as a spectroscopic tool, which has dramatically increased the intensity of molecular beams and also greatly simplified the spectra. This innovation has been second only to the invention of the laser in its impact on high-resolution spectroscopy.|$|E
