500|$|Musicologist and pianist Guthrie Ramsay Jr. {{describes}} Illmatic as “an artistic emblem” that “anchors {{itself in}} the moment while <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> powerful musical statements often select past material and knowledge {{for use in the}} present and hope for the future.” Kevin Coval considers the sampling of artists Craig G and Biz Markie in 'Memory Lane' as an attempt to build upon the hip hop tradition of Queens, most notably the Juice Crew All Stars. These samples are intended to serve as tributes to “Nas's lyrical [...] and around-the-way influences. He is repping his borough’s hip hop canon.” The involvement of older artists, including Nas’s father, has also been cited as a formative influence in the making of Illmatic. Author Adam Mansbach argues, “It's the presence of all these benevolent elders –his father and the cadre of big brother producers steering the album – that empowers Nas to rest comfortably in his identity as an artist and an inheritor of tradition, and thus find the space to innovate.” ...|$|E
500|$|Lasseter also {{explained}} that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: [...] "Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins." [...] Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: [...] "John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, {{they need to have}} that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy {{to the point where the}} audience might see them as rubber toys." [...] According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, [...] "Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do." ...|$|E

So it's fitting that she wraps up the deluxe edition with the title track [...] Deep down, she does have a rebel heart— and you can't fault her for <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> pop music is all the better for it". Of the leaked demo, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that [...] "it’s taken the best parts of Avicii’s sound and blended them with Madonna, rather than giving us an ear-assaulting [...] "Avicii feat. Madonna" [...] number about 'putting your drinks up' and 'getting down on the floor'". Spin said it was the singer's [...] "sweetest melody since 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', with her register dropped an octave or two until it resembles the Liz Phair of 2005's (underrated) Somebody's Miracle". Q magazine called it a [...] "movingly autobiographical title track, where Madonna reflects at length on her career and her motivation. It makes you wonder what she thinks she has to prove in 2015 with a song like 'Bitch I'm Madonna' when she proved it all and we’ve been paying attention for years".|$|E
500|$|After what he {{felt was}} a period of bad episodes {{culminating}} with [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine praised [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as a [...] "palate cleanser, <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> this show is meant to be, above all else, fun". He described the episode as an [...] "expected pleasure, disarming in a way [...] hasn't been since Season One, back before these people became jaded by [...] "Others" [...] and consumed with tedious busy work while the show's producers figured out what frequently disappointing direction to push them in next." [...] Dignan did however acknowledge that others might not have found the episode as enjoyable as he did. Erin Martell of TV Squad wasn't sure what to think of the episode, believing that it was [...] "entertaining" [...] but produced nothing new for viewers. She did note that the characters are now in place to take action for following episodes, and hoped that the episode's [...] "slow-moving events" [...] were [...] "building up to some serious resolution". Rather than dismiss the episode for lacking a mythology-related storyline, Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a joyous and poignant hour of television", and said that it [...] "could very well be a cleverly crafted allegory for the history of The Dharma Initiative on The Island." ...|$|E
500|$|Beecham {{had died}} in 1961, and Fenby writes that it [...] "seemed to many then that nothing could save Delius's music from extinction", such was the conductor's unique mastery over the music. However, other {{conductors}} have continued to advocate Delius, and since the centenary year, the Delius Society has pursued the aim of [...] "develop a greater knowledge of the life and works of Delius". [...] The music has never become fashionable, [...] a fact often acknowledged by promoters and critics. To suggestions that Delius's music is an [...] "acquired taste", Fenby answers: [...] "The music of Delius is not an acquired taste. One either likes it the moment one first hears it, or {{the sound of it}} is once and for ever distasteful to one. It is an art which will never enjoy an appeal to the many, but one which will always be loved, and dearly loved, by the few." [...] Writing in 2004 on the 70th anniversary of Delius's death, the Guardian journalist Martin Kettle recalls Cardus arguing in 1934 that Delius as a composer was unique, both in his technique and in his emotionalism. Although he eschewed classical formalism, it was wrong, Cardus believed, to regard Delius merely as [...] "a tone-painter, an impressionist or a maker of programme music". His music's abiding feature is, Cardus wrote, that it [...] "recollects emotion in tranquillity... Delius is always <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> beauty is born by contemplation after the event".|$|E

500|$|Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani, Joe Levy of Billboard, and Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone each {{awarded the}} album 3.5 out of 5 stars. Cinquemani {{wrote that the}} album was [...] "all over the map", yet felt it was [...] "a {{surprisingly}} coherent one". Levy wrote that the album was [...] "subtle" [...] compared to [...] "current standards", adding that: [...] "These songs unfold slowly, building through foreplay-like intros before hooks are displayed over a shifting series of textures". Ganz felt that Rebel Heart [...] "is at its strongest when Madonna shoves everyone {{to the side and}} just tells it to us straight", and added: [...] "Deep down, Madonna does have a rebel heart– and you can't fault her for <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> pop music is all the better for it". Jamieson Cox of Time commended the album for its consistent production and sound, and for Madonna's vocals and songwriting. Giving it a rating of [...] "B", Kyle Anderson and Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly called the album [...] "Madonna's best outing since 2000's Music". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian and Time Out writer Nick Levine gave the album 3 out of 5 stars. Petridis felt that the two contrasting sides of the album did not [...] "quite gel", reasoning that: [...] "the former might represent the music Madonna wants to make, while the latter is the music she feels obliged to make". Levine wrote: [...] "'Rebel Heart' may lack cohesion, but she's definitely not down for the count: this contains some of the best music Madonna's made in a decade".|$|E
500|$|Television {{commentators}} {{praised the}} pilot episode. Heather Havrilesky of Salon declared that [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] raised expectations for future {{competition at the}} time, and added that it emulated {{some of the best}} episodes of The Sopranos. Chicago Tribune journalist Maureen Ryan said that it was an [...] "intelligently made character drama". In his four star review, Adam Buckman of New York Post described it as [...] "stunning" [...] and suggested that Mad Men [...] "just happens to be the finest new TV series of the summer and possibly the entire year". Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle and Brian Lowry of Variety lauded the episode for its historical accuracy; [...] "Just because they're on the cusp of a new decade does not mean they can see what viewers already know is around the corner," [...] stated Goodman. [...] "That impending change gives an extra dimension of perspective to the series." [...] Lowry addressed that despite the subtle approach of Mad Men, it managed to provoke a profound meaning. [...] "In that context, the show illustrates that period's own form of excess without wagging fingers, while <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> before sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, there was sexual harassment, free-flowing cocktails and bluesy ballads, invariably sung by white guys." [...] USA Today writer Robert Bianco echoed synonymous sentiment: [...] "Mad Men is a joy to watch—the clothes, the clocks, the furniture, it's like a mid-century night's dream. But this is no mere period piece. It's a smart, complex drama that attempts to get through the facades that have always hidden the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang, {{writing for}} Variety magazine, gave the film a {{positive}} review {{and called it}} [...] "the most grueling and sustained American combat picture since Black Hawk Down, {{as well as a}} prime example of how impressive physical filmmaking can overcome even fundamental deficiencies in script and characterization." [...] Alonso Duralde, writing for The Wrap, stated, [...] "The film never makes a grand statement {{about whether or not the}} war in Afghanistan is, per se, a mistake, but it does portray war itself as a disgusting folly. Berg sets up the cathartic moments we’re used to in movies like this, but then he pulls out the rug, <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the cavalry doesn’t always miraculously show up in time to save the day." [...] Todd McCarthy, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the film as being [...] "rugged, skilled, relentless, determined, narrow-minded and focused, everything that a soldier must be when his life is on the line," [...] while Scott Bowles of USA Today called Lone Survivor [...] "brutal, unrelenting and ultimately moving." [...] Leonard Maltin described the film as [...] "visceral", while praising Berg, the main actors, and the stunt performers for successfully reenacting the events of Operation Red Wings. Maltin concluded that the film [...] "is a tough movie but a rewarding one. It's humbling to watch this dramatization of the sacrifices these men make, without hesitation. Peter Berg was determined to do justice to them, and he has succeeded." [...] Betsy Sharkey, writing for The Los Angeles Times, praised the overall look of the film: [...] "The production and costume designers have paid a great deal of attention to the details, from the uniforms and tribal robes, to the bullet wounds and blood. It certainly adds to the film's verisimilitude." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{pictorial}} {{nature of the}} oracle bone script, it was a fully functional and mature writing system {{by the time of}} the Shang dynasty, i.e., able to record the Old Chinese language in its entirety and not just isolated kinds of meaning. This level of maturity clearly implies an earlier period of development of at least several hundred years. From their presumed origins as pictographs and signs, by the Shang dynasty, most graphs were already conventionalized in such a simplified fashion that the meanings of many of the pictographs are not immediately apparent. Compare, for instance, the third and fourth graphs in the row below. Without careful research to compare these to later forms, one would probably not know that these represented 豕 shĭ [...] "swine" [...] and 犬 quǎn [...] "dog", respectively. As Boltz (1994 & 2003 p.31–33) notes, most of the oracle bone graphs are not depicted realistically enough for those who do not already know the script to recognize what they stand for; although pictographic in origin they are no longer pictographs in function. Boltz instead calls them zodiographs (p.33), <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> functionally they represent words, and only through the words do they represent concepts, while for similar reasons Qiu labels them semantographs.|$|E
