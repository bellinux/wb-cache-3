Past attempts to relate <b>rip</b> channels to wave conditions have not resulted in good relationships between <b>rip</b> characteristics (e. g. <b>rip</b> spacing) and waves. In order to address this problem, a 3. 3 year <b>rip</b> channel data set was obtained using an improved computer-based technique to locate <b>rips</b> from video imagery.

Observations of six events when <b>rip</b> channels changed their spatial configuration are {{used to create a}} conceptual model for how <b>rip</b> channels respond to changes in the wave conditions. When <b>rip</b> channels are small in relation to the wave energy, these <b>rips</b> are more likely than larger <b>rips</b> (extending less than ~ 70 m cross-shore) to evolve.

40|$|The death domain kinase <b>Rip</b> 1 is {{recruited}} to the tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 and mediates the IkappaB kinase and p 38 MAP kinase pathways. In response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), we find <b>Rip</b> 1 phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, suggesting that <b>Rip</b> 1 phosphorylation may stimulate its ubiquitination. To address {{the contribution of}} the kinase activity of <b>Rip</b> 1 to its ubiquitination and to TNF-alpha signaling, we introduced wild type <b>Rip</b> 1 and a kinase-inactive form of <b>Rip</b> 1, <b>Rip</b> 1 D 138 N, into <b>rip</b> 1 -/- murine embryonic fibroblast cells by retroviral infection. TNF-alpha-induced ubiquitination of <b>Rip</b> 1 is observed in <b>Rip</b> 1 D 138 N cells, supporting the argument that <b>Rip</b> 1 autophosphorylation is not required for <b>Rip</b> 1 ubiquitination. TNF-alpha-induced Ikk and p 38 MAP kinase activation is normal, and the <b>Rip</b> 1 D 138 N cells are resistant to TNF-alpha-induced cell death, indicating that the kinase activity of <b>Rip</b> 1 is not required to mediate its antiapoptotic functions. In the absence of Traf 2, TNF-alpha-induced ubiquitination of <b>Rip</b> 1 is impaired, suggesting that Traf 2 may be the E 3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the TNF-alpha-dependent, ubiquitination of <b>Rip</b> 1. Finally, recruitment of the ubiquitinated Tak 1 complex is dependent on the presence of <b>Rip</b> 1, suggesting that <b>Rip</b> 1 ubiquitination rather than its phosphorylation is critical in signaling...|$|R

40|$|<b>RIP</b> 1 and its homologs, <b>RIP</b> 2 and <b>RIP</b> 3, {{form part}} of a family of Ser/Thr kinases that {{regulate}} signal transduction processes leading to NF-κB activation. Here, we identify <b>RIP</b> 4 (DIK/PKK) as a novel member of the <b>RIP</b> kinase family. <b>RIP</b> 4 contains an N-terminal RIP-like kinase domain and a C-terminal region characterized by the presence of 11 ankyrin repeats. Overexpression of <b>RIP</b> 4 leads to activation of NF-κB and JNK. Kinase inactive <b>RIP</b> 4 or a truncated version containing the ankyrin repeats have a dominant negative (DN) effect on NF-κB induction by multiple stimuli. <b>RIP</b> 4 binds to several members of the TRAF protein family, and DN versions of TRAF 1, TRAF 3 and TRAF 6 inhibit <b>RIP</b> 4 -induced NF-κB activation. Moreover, <b>RIP</b> 4 is cleaved after Asp 340 and Asp 378 during Fas-induced apoptosis. These data suggest that <b>RIP</b> 4 is involved in NF-κB and JNK signaling and that caspase-dependent processing of <b>RIP</b> 4 may negatively regulate NF-κB-dependent pro-survival or pro-inflammatory signals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe tumor {{necrosis}} factor receptor 1 (TNFR 1) and the Fas receptor recruit complexes {{formed by}} the interactions between <b>RIP</b> kinase, TRADD, FADD and RAIDD – adaptor proteins that contain death domains – which in turn recruit other proteins to initiate signaling [1 – 5]. To identify proteins associated with the TNF signaling pathway, we performed a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen using <b>RIP</b> as bait. We isolated a kinase, <b>RIP</b> 3, which shares homology with the kinase domain of <b>RIP</b> and <b>RIP</b> 2 (also known as Rick or CARDIAK). <b>RIP</b> 3 could be co-immunoprecipitated with <b>RIP,</b> TRAF 2 and TNFR 1 in mammalian cells. The carboxy-terminal domain of <b>RIP</b> 3, like that of <b>RIP,</b> could activate the transcription factor NFκB and induce apoptosis when expressed in mammalian cells. Interestingly, this region shares no significant sequence homology to the death domain of <b>RIP,</b> the caspase-recruiting domain (CARD) of <b>RIP</b> 2 [6 – 8] or any other apoptosis-inducing domain. As with <b>RIP</b> and <b>RIP</b> 2, the kinase domain of <b>RIP</b> 3 was not required for either NFκB activation or apoptosis induction. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of <b>RIP</b> 3 strongly inhibited the caspase activation but not the NFκB activation induced by TNFα.

40|$|Necroptosis/programmed {{necrosis}} is {{initiated by}} a macro-molecular protein complex termed the necrosome. Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK 1 /RIP 1) and <b>RIP</b> 3 are {{key components of}} the necrosome. TNFα is a prototypic inducer of necrosome activation, and {{it is widely believed}} that deubiquitination of <b>RIP</b> 1 at the TNFR- 1 signaling complex precedes transition of <b>RIP</b> 1 into the cytosol where it forms the <b>RIP</b> 1 -RIP 3 necrosome. Cylindromatosis (CYLD) is believed to promote programmed necrosis by facilitating <b>RIP</b> 1 deubiquitination at this membrane receptor complex. We demonstrate that <b>RIP</b> 1 is indeed the primary target of CYLD in TNFα-induced programmed necrosis. We observed that CYLD does not regulate <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination at the TNF receptor. TNF and zVAD-induced programmed necrosis was highly attenuated in CYLD(-/-) cells. However, in the presence of cycloheximide or SMAC mimetics, programmed necrosis was only moderately reduced in CYLD(-/-) cells. Under the latter conditions, <b>RIP</b> 1 -RIP 3 necrosome formation is only delayed, but not abolished in CYLD(-/-) cells. We further demonstrate that <b>RIP</b> 1 within the NP- 40 insoluble necrosome is ubiquitinated and that CYLD regulates <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination in this compartment. Hence, <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination in this late-forming complex is greatly increased in CYLD(-/-) cells. Increased <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination impairs <b>RIP</b> 1 and <b>RIP</b> 3 phosphorylation, a signature of kinase activation. Our results show that CYLD regulates <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination in the TNFα-induced necrosome, but not in the TNFR- 1 signaling complex. In cells sensitized to programmed necrosis with SMAC mimetics, CYLD is not essential for necrosome assembly. Since SMAC mimetics induces the loss of the E 3 ligases cIAP 1 and cIAP 2, reduced <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination could lead to reduced requirement for CYLD to remove ubiquitin chains from <b>RIP</b> 1 in the TNFR- 1 complex. As increased <b>RIP</b> 1 ubiquitination in the necrosome correlates with impaired <b>RIP</b> 1 and <b>RIP</b> 3 phosphorylation and function, these results suggest that CYLD controls <b>RIP</b> 1 kinase activity during necrosome assembly...|$|R

Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we determined the activated PKCe as the specific trigger for <b>RIP</b> 140 arginine methylation and its subsequent export. We identified two PKCe–phosphorylated residues of <b>RIP</b> 140, Ser- 102 and Ser- 1003, which synergistically stimulated direct binding of <b>RIP</b> 140 by 14 - 3 - 3 that recruited protein arginine methyl transferase 1 to methylate <b>RIP</b> 140. The methylated <b>RIP</b> 140 then preferentially recruited exportin 1 for nuclear export. As a result, the nuclear gene-repressive activity of <b>RIP</b> 140 was reduced.

Because the activation of <b>RIP</b> 3 requires stimulation by certain extracellular stimuli such as ligands of death receptors or Toll-like receptors, we compared the phosphorylation sites of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -treated peritoneal macrophages from <b>RIP</b> 3 (+/+) and <b>RIP</b> 3 (+/+) mice and the phosphorylation sites of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -treated <b>RIP</b> 3 (+/+) and <b>RIP</b> 3 (+/+) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and spike-in stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture were used in the analyses of the MEFs and macrophages, respectively. Proteomic analyses using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture coupled with immobilized metal affinity chromatography-hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography fractionation and nanoLC MS/MS identified 14, 057 phosphopeptides in 4306 proteins from the macrophages and 4732 phosphopeptides in 1785 proteins from the MEFs. Analysis of amino acid sequence motifs among the phosphopeptides identified a potential motif of <b>RIP</b> 3 phosphorylation. Among the phosphopeptides identified, 73 were found exclusively in <b>RIP</b> 3 (+/+) macrophages, 121 were detected exclusively from <b>RIP</b> 3 (+/+) MEFs, 286 phosphopeptides were induced more in <b>RIP</b> 3 (+/+) macrophages than in <b>RIP</b> 3 (+/+) macrophages and 26 phosphopeptides had higher induction in <b>RIP</b> 3 (+/+) MEFs than in <b>RIP</b> 3 (+/+) cells. Many of the <b>RIP</b> 3 regulated phosphoproteins from the macrophages and MEF cells are functionally associated with the cell cycle; the rest, however, appear to have diverse functions in that a number of metabolism related proteins were phosphorylated in macrophages and development related phosphoproteins were induced in MEFs.
