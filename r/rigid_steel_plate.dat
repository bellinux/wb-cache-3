40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports a}} {{follow-up}} feasibility study on different approaches for numerical modeling of blast loads, implemented {{recently in a}} few commercial programs based on finite element method and explicit time integration. Four approaches have been considered including: explicit blast wave representation using fluid-structure interaction (FSI) with 2 D and 3 D multi-material arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulations, direct application of empirical explosive blast loads on structures, and the most recent, combined method, in which direct empirical loading is applied to a reduced ALE domain. Each of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses, although the last {{one seems to be}} the most universal. Based on the published experimental data, a benchmark problem was selected, which considers a pressure loading exerted by explosion of near field hemispherical charges on a <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> The comparison is done in terms of pressure peaks (overpressure) and time histories of reflected pressure, and reflected specific impulses...|$|E

The test beds were subjected to uniformly distributed load {{by means of a}} <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> Loads with corresponding settlement were measured during the testing. EPS geofoam cellular reinforcement of densities 15, 20, 22, and 30 kg/m(3) were prepared {{in the form of a}} mattress with three different heights of 50, 75, and 100 mm. The effects of density of EPS geofoam, height of cellular reinforcement, and the planar jute geotextile layer at the base of cellular reinforcement were tested through a series of tests to systematically study the overall performance of the system in terms of load carrying capacity and settlement behavior. Test results indicated that the provision of EPS geofoam cellular reinforcement in fly ash bed significantly improved load carrying capacity above the clay bed. The load carrying capacity decreased with increasing density of EPS geofoam and increased with increase in height of cellular reinforcement. A layer of jute geotextile placed at the base of cellular reinforcement further enhanced load carrying capacity for less height of cellular reinforcement. However, the effect of planer reinforcement was decreased with the increase in height of cellular reinforcement...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study the load bearing {{capacity}} of anchor plates, used for anchorage to concrete located at nuclear facilities. Two different type of anchor plates were examined, which together constitute {{the majority of the}} anchor plates used at Forsmark nuclear facility in Sweden. The first is a cast-in-place anchor plate with headed studs and the second is a post-installed anchor plate which uses sleevetype expansion anchors. Hence, anchors with both a mechanical or a frictional interlock to the concrete were examined. The main analysis tool was the finite element method, through the use of the two commercially available software packages ABAQUS and ADINA and their non-linear material models for concrete and steel. As a first step, the numerical methods were verified against experimental results from the literature. However, these only concern single anchors. The results from the verifications were then used to build the finite element models of the anchor plates. These were then subjected to different load combinations with the purpose to find the ultimate load capacity. Failure loads from the finite element analyses were then compared to the corresponding loads calculated according to the new European technical specification SIS-CEN/TS 1992 - 4 (2009). Most of the failure loads from the numerical analyses were higher than the loads obtained from the technical specification, although in some cases the numerical results were lower than the technical specification value. However, many conservative assumptions regarding the finite element models were made, hence there might still be an overcapacity present. All analyses that underestimate the failure load were limited to large and slender anchor plates, which exhibit an extensive bending of the <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> The bending of the <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> induce shear forces on the anchors, which leads to a lower tensile capacity. In design codes, which assume <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates,</b> this phenomenon is neglected. The failure loads from all different load combinations analysed were then used to develop failure envelopes as a demonstration of a useful technique, which can be utilised in the design process of complex load cases...|$|R
40|$|The use of light-truss {{pultruded}} structures with {{bolted connections}} is nowadays a technique for the enhancement or a partial replacement of existing floors or roofs, because the light {{weight of the}} profiles enables them to be easily moved {{in the field and}} the limited increase in mass is favourable with respect to the building seismic behaviour. In common design practice, a simplified load distribution among the bolts in multi-row joints is used for the dimensioning, but no distinctions on the geometrical and mechanical characteristics of the jointed elements is considered. In this paper the results of a numerical investigation on the behaviour of a double lap joint composed of a central <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> placed between two side glass pultruded profiles and subjected to tensile axial forces are presented and discussed. As the resistance of the multiple bolted connection is influenced by the local pin bearing deformation, a preliminary experimental programme was conducted so as to investigate the local bearing deformation {{in the vicinity of the}} fastener. So, 8 and 10 mm thick pultruded elements, jointed with 12 and 16 mm diameter steel bolts, respectively, are considered for the numerical simulations.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{indicate that}} the bearing strength of concrete is increased by the confinement effect provided by the enveloping concrete. Various empirical formulas {{have been used in}} international codes relating the bearing strength of concrete to the compressive strength and the ratio of the total surface area to load bearing area (A/Ab) (known as bearing ratio). This study presents a new approach developed for the bearing strength of concrete loaded through <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> by way of analyzing the final failure pattern of concrete prism and cube specimen under axial compression considering slip planes direction, mechanical properties of normal weight concrete, relative element height and the effect of the bearing ratio. The main objective of the present paper is thus an attempt to put forward an analytical approach which conservatively predicts the bearing strength of normal weight concrete and accounts for all of the parameters mentioned above. The method depends on the final failure pattern mechanism of concrete prism and cube under axial compression load and considers the possible failure mode of diagonal shear failure, direction of shear failure planes, characteristic compressive strength of normal weight concrete, relative element height and the effect of the A/Ab ratio.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effectiveness of}} geocell mattress prepared with waste plastic bottles with fly ash as a filling material overlying soft clay bed through laboratory model tests. The test beds were subjected to loading {{by means of a}} square <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> as a footing. The effect of height and width of geocell mattress as well as basal bamboo geogrid underneath geocell mattress on overall performance of the system in terms of footing pressure, settlement, and the adjacent surface deformation (heave/settlement) has been systematically studied through a series of tests. Test results indicate around twofold increases in the bearing pressure by placing a jute geotextile separator beneath the unreinforced fly ash bed, whereas reinforcing the fly ash bed with geocell mattress in presence of a basal bamboo geogrid and jute geotextile separator can produce sevenfold increases in the footing pressure. Inclusion of a basal bamboo geogrid improves overall behavior of the reinforced bed. No surface deformation occurred in the unreinforced beds. Inclusion of a geocell mattress improves the footing pressure, but creates surface deformation (heave/settlement). Increase in height as well as width of geocell mattress not only diminishes the surface heaving but also increases the footing pressure. As the present study carries limitation of boundary and scale effects, the quantitative results must be extrapolated by dimensional analysis before use in practical applications or a field study is required. However, the qualitative results encourage the use of waste plastic bottles for soft ground improvement, which in turn may solve the disposal issue to a certain extent.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the drained bearing response of circular footings resting on structured soil deposits. Numerical simulations {{have been carried}} out using a finite element formulation of the Structured Cam Clay model. A parametric study was conducted by varying the parameters that govern the behaviour of structured soils and guidelines are given for designers to identify when effects of the soil structure are important. Under fully drained conditions, deformation within the structured soil supporting the footing usually occurs as a local or punching shear failure due to high compressibility of the structured soil and the mobilised bearing pressure increases with the footing movement, without reaching an ultimate value. A novel approximate method is presented to obtain the load–displacement response of a rigid circular footing resting on the surface of a structured soil deposit. This requires the properties of the soil in the reconstituted state and two additional parameters, which govern the natural structure of the soil. The proposed method has been applied to a published case study, where plate load test results are given for <b>rigid</b> circular <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> resting on structured soil deposits. Fair agreement is observed between the computed and experimental results, suggesting the approximate method may be useful in design studies of foundations on structured soil deposits...|$|R

40|$|Several {{geotechnical}} {{engineering structures}} (e. g. pavements, slabs-on-grade, footings) transfer {{pressure to the}} ground through a contact area with the supporting soil. Design of these structures usually assumes that full contact is established throughout the service life of the structure. Erosion of the subgrade soil is a common mechanism {{that can lead to}} the development of subsurface voids and consequently a contact loss between the structure and the supporting soil characterized by a void space under the structure. The performance of surface structures such as concrete pavements, slabs-on-grade, and sidewalks subjected to subsurface soil erosion is investigated experimentally and numerically in this thesis. The experiments were performed in a rigid tank holding a prism of sand with artificially created soil erosion; supporting a <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> The surface deformation and contact pressure at the plate-soil interface were measured to quantify the effect of subsurface soil erosion on the stresses developing in the surface structure. Numerical modeling was conducted using 2 D elasto-plastic finite element analysis. The model was first validated using the experimental results. Several scenarios were then considered where parameters such as the volume of soil erosion, its location, and the magnitude of the load the concrete slab is subjected to, were varied. Results of this investigation indicated that when the void space is centered under the slab-on-grade, tensile stresses developing in the structure increased as the size of the void increased causing ultimately the failure of the slab. It has also been concluded that when the void is offcentered, the supporting soil around the void space is likely to experience shear failure before excessive tensile stresses develop in the outermost fibers of the structure...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} an already existing Finite Element (FE) model of a truck steering wheel, using experimental testing and computer modeling. Statistics show a high risk of sustaining severe injuries, in a frontal crash of heavy vehicles, due to steering wheel rim to thorax contact. The Hybrid III crash test dummy is now also used for analyzing heavy vehicle frontal crashes. It was originally developed for passenger cars and load cases common to them. To use in heavy vehicles, loading pattern to Hybrid III torso is now changed from the central hub to the rim of steering wheel. The Hybrid III crash test dummy is also available in FE codes. In order to investigate the heavy vehicle crashes in FE, a validated FE steering wheel model is also required. An impact test setup was designed and replicated both in physical testing and computer modeling. Since the steering wheel can be adjusted at different tilt angles of the rim during driving, a set of tilt angles 0, 10, 20 and 30 degree was selected to see the behavior of steering wheel on impact with the <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> The contact force, impact plate displacement and component deformations were the key parameters to be observed and compared, in order to validate the FE steering wheel model. During physical tests for all the tilt angles, the steering wheel showed a stiff behavior regarding force level and horizontal displacement of the impact plate. Variation in peak force level during simulation and physical tests is less than 5 % for 0 and 10 degree. The simulation results were considered validated for 78 mm and 66 mm of impact plate displacement for 0 and 10 degree respectively. Similarly, peak force level was found 26 % and 45 % higher in physical tests for 20 and 30 degree respectively. The simulation results were found out of the corridor limits, and FE model was not considered as validated for 20 and 30 degree tilt angles. Presence of foam is found one of the major differences between the steering wheel and its FE model, as this foam absorbs some energy from the impact plate. This foam is absent in FE model. For a better agreement of FE model with the steering wheel, FE model may need to be stiffer. Modeling of foam around the steering wheel can be the other alternative...|$|E
