5|$|Leicester {{were viewed}} {{as one of the}} favourites for {{promotion}} in the 2011–12 season, but on 24 October 2011, following an inconsistent start with the Foxes winning just 5 out of their first 13 matches, Eriksson left the club by mutual consent. Three weeks later, Nigel Pearson returned to the club as Eriksson's successor. Pearson would go on to lead the Foxes to a sixth-place finish in the 2012–13 season, ensuring Leicester were in the Championship play-offs. However, Leicester lost the playoff semi-final 3–2 on aggregate to Watford after Anthony Knockaert missed a late penalty and Troy Deeney scored <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> after a swift counterattack from a Manuel Almunia double save.|$|E

The sequel was a box office success, grossing over $25.5 million in the United States. In terms of the response from film critics, the film has received mixed reviews both during its initial run in theatres and since; several commentators criticized the film's generally uneven pace, certain plot holes and muted character performances, while praise was received to the film's genuinely scary moments that captured {{the spirit of the}} first film.|$|E

Between 970 and 973 a council was held, under the aegis of Edgar, where a set of rules were devised that would be applicable throughout England. This put all the monks and nuns in England under one set of detailed customs for the first time. In 973, Edgar received a special second, 'imperial coronation' at Bath, and from this point England was ruled by Edgar under the strong influence of Dunstan, Athelwold, and Oswald, the Bishop of Worcester.|$|E

25|$|As in the {{previous}} year's event, {{the battle for the}} win was between the title contenders Mikko Hirvonen of Ford and Sébastien Loeb of Citroën. Although Loeb proved faster on the opening super special stage, Hirvonen took the lead when the rally really got underway on Friday, and began building up a lead by about a second per stage. Loeb backed off and settled for second after damaging a tyre and losing 13 seconds on SS15. Hirvonen's win was his first in his home event, after finishing runner-up to Marcus Grönholm in 2007 and to Loeb in 2008. Jari-Matti Latvala, who suffered from food poisoning on day two, passed Dani Sordo to take his first podium in his home event. Petter Solberg also looked set to challenge for a podium place, but suffered a puncture and then went wide and got stuck in a ditch <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the fourth stage.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of these factors meant McManaman suffered a loss of form, but, McManaman managed to rally and pick up his play <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of that last campaign. McManaman scored a crucial goal away at Blackburn Rovers, set up a dramatic injury time equaliser with a through-ball for Paul Ince to score {{in front of the}} Kop against Manchester United, and scored the winner from outside the area with a half volley to complete the full turn around result against Tottenham Hotspur after trailing 2–0 at half-time. In what was the final match of the season, and what would be McManaman's final match and final contribution on the pitch for the club, McManaman assisted Karl-Heinz Riedle with a goal at the Kop with a trademark right wing run and pull back as Liverpool won 3–0 against Wimbledon, enabling McManaman to end his career at the club to a standing ovation, a lap of honour at Anfield, and a two row squad farewell at the entrance of the players' tunnel.|$|E
25|$|Cave 1 {{was built}} on the eastern end of the horse-shoe shaped scarp and is now the first cave the visitor encounters. This cave, when first made, would have been a less {{prominent}} position, <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the row. According to Spink, {{it is one of the}} last caves to have been excavated, when the best sites had been taken and was never fully inaugurated for worship by the dedication of the Buddha image in the central shrine. This is shown by the absence of sooty deposits from butter lamps on the base of the shrine image, and the lack of damage to the paintings that would have happened if the garland-hooks around the shrine had been in use for any period of time. Spink states that the Vākāţaka Emperor Harishena was the benefactor of the work, and this is reflected in the emphasis on imagery of royalty in the cave, with those Jataka tales being selected that tell of those previous lives of the Buddha in which he was royal.|$|E

25|$|Ohio {{received}} the opening second half kickoff, {{but failed to}} avenge the first half time of possession deficit (ECU possessed the ball for more than 20 of the 30 minutes in the first half), and quickly punted the ball to ECU, but the Pirates also punted after an ineffective series. On Ohio's ensuing drive, Tettleton took off running on one play, and exited the game with an apparent ankle injury; Vick subsequently entered the game for one play before Tettleton's return. Later on the drive, Ohio converted a fourth down to advance into the red zone; Josiah Yazdani subsequently attempted a 29-yard field goal, which he made, tying the game, to culminate a 16-play, 60-yard drive. After exchanging punts, ECU advanced into Ohio territory on a drive highlighted by a 37-yard pass from Carden to Worthy, but that was decimated once deep in Ohio's territory by a chop block penalty, ultimately forcing the Pirates {{to settle for a}} 29-yard field goal attempt that Harvey missed wide <b>right.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the quarter, the game was tied at 17.|$|E
25|$|Leaving Oxford, van der Bijl {{returned}} to South Africa, {{but did not}} play first-class cricket {{over the next couple}} of seasons. He reappeared in three games in the 1934–35 season for Western Province with no great success, and was not in the 1935 South African team in England. The following year, he played only one match, <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the season, and did not feature in the Tests against the Australians. From 1936–37, however, he played more regularly and in 1937–38, he was the captain of the Western Province side. Regular cricket brought more success: he finally hit a first-class century, more than 10 years after his debut, in making 195 against Griqualand West in 1936–37, which would remain his highest first-class score – in this match he also opened the bowling, though he did not take any wickets, and he was never a regular bowler. The following season, in a dozen innings, there were two further centuries and five other scores of more than 50, and he averaged 60.30.|$|E
25|$|Norman {{was educated}} at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge.

At Cambridge University in 1858 he went straight into the first team for cricket and in his first first-class match, against the Cambridge Town Club, he made 100, putting on 160 for the fourth wicket with William Benthall who made 103 and was also making his first-class cricket debut. He retained {{his place in the}} Cambridge side across the season and was picked for the University Match against Oxford University; in this game, he top-scored for Cambridge with 43 in the first innings but failed, {{with the rest of the}} side, in the second innings when the whole team was dismissed for just 39. At the end of the university cricket season, Norman was picked for the 1858 Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, which the Players team won decisively. <b>Right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the season, he played a single game for Kent which Sussex, largely through the bowling of John Wisden and Jemmy Dean, also won easily.

25|$|Many non-academic sources claim a {{government}} sniper killed Saad; however, {{there is no}} evidence to support such a claim, and it appears that whoever had killed him had intended that what began as a small and quiet demonstration to evolve into something more. The sniper targeted Saad <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the demonstration as it was dissipating. Farid Khazen, sourcing the local histories of Sidon academics and eyewitnesses, gives a run-down of the puzzling events of the day that based on their research. Other interesting facts that Khazen reveals, based on the Sidon academic's work including that Saad was not in dispute with the fishing consortium made up of Yugoslav nationals. In fact, the Yugoslavian representatives in Lebanon had negotiated with the fisherman's union to make the fisherman shareholders in the company; the company offered to modernize the Fisherman's equipment and buy their catch, give their fisherman's a union and annual subsidy. Saad, as a union representative (and not the mayor of Sidon at the time as many erroneous sources claim), was offered a place on the company's board too. There has been some speculation that Saad's attempts to narrow the differences between the fishermen and the consortium, and his acceptance of a place on the board made him a target of attack by the conspirator who sought a full conflagration around the small protest. The events in Sidon were not contained for long. The government began to lose control of the situation in 1975.|$|E
500|$|Drums on [...] "Satan's Bed" [...] were {{performed}} by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On {{the day it}} was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as [...] "Jimmy". Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for Vitalogy, Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with the band members. Gossard said, [...] "It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled." [...] Jack Irons, the original drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on [...] "Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me". Gossard said, [...] "Jack entered the band <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of making Vitalogy. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man.
