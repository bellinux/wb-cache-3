5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} was practically uncontested during his final years, and he enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} reformer distinct from Martin Luther. Initially, Luther and Calvin had mutual <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> A doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich reformer Huldrych Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist. Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp. Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation movement. At the same time, Calvin was dismayed by the lack of unity among the reformers. He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Playford, used to {{cooperating}} with Labor leaders more than attacking them, sensed Dunstan's promise and, predicting {{that one day}} Dunstan {{would be at the}} helm, attempted to establish bonds. So, after a late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, Norwood, it was only a small deviance from Playford's normal route to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> but due to the strength of their respective views (Playford was a liberal conservative, Dunstan a libertarian socialist), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.|$|E

They also shared a love for the works of Maimonides.|$|E

Glover said: We {{not only have}} great <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as athletes but we are great friends {{on and off the}} water.

In a dark match at WrestleMania XXVIII on 1 April, also involving the Usos, they attempted to win the championship but were unsuccessful. During the match, Gabriel suffered a hyperextended and twisted elbow, rendering him inactive for several weeks. He returned on the 30 May episode of NXT, scoring the win for himself, Derrick Bateman and Percy Watson over the team of JTG, Johnny Curtis and Michael McGillicutty.|$|E
25|$|Well {{aware of}} Junior Johnson's long-standing, steadfast rule of never {{discussing}} an adjustment to a driver's contractual salary, and never really comformfortable with {{the allocation of}} resources that Johnson's two car team required, Waltrip approached Johnson about an increase in his contract salary. Although the story, as told by Waltrip, is most likely fokelore, Waltrip drove his final race for Junior Johnson on November 16, 1986, in a Chevrolet sponsored by Budweiser, finishing 4th, at that year's Winston Western 500 at Riverside International Raceway in Riverside, California, completing {{one of the most}} successful owner/driver partnerships in all of motorsports history. Waltrip and Johnson remain close friends and have huge <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as driver and owner and pioneers of the sport.|$|E
25|$|After the fight, Lewis {{decided he}} needed a new trainer to replace Pepe Correa, who had become {{increasingly}} difficult to work with. Correa denounced Lewis in public after being fired. Renowned trainer Emanuel Steward, who had been McCall's trainer during their fight, was Lewis' choice. Even before the fight with McCall, Steward had seen much potential in Lewis and immediately {{expressed a desire to}} work with him. He corrected several of Lewis' technical flaws, which included maintaining a more balanced stance, less reliance on his straight right hand, and a focus on using a strong, authoritative jab; the latter of which would become a hallmark of Lewis' style throughout the rest of his career. Their partnership lasted until Lewis' retirement, both having mutual praise and <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to this day.|$|E

25|$|The Bills and Jets both {{represent}} {{the state of}} New York, though the Jets actually play their games in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The rivalry started as the Bills and Jets were both original teams in the AFL. Though the rivalry represents the differences between New York City and Upstate New York, {{it is not as}} intense as the Bills' rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots, and the teams' fanbases usually have a begrudging <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> when not playing one another. Often times the rivalry has become beset with ugly games and mediocrity, but the rivalry briefly heated up when former Jets head coach Rex Ryan became head coach of the Bills for two seasons. Buffalo leads the series 60-53 as of 2016, including a playoff win in 1981.|$|E
25|$|Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser): A young, ambitious account {{executive}} {{from an old}} New York family with connections and a privileged background. Often displaying recurring lapses in experience and judgement, Campbell's ruthless {{climb to the top}} causes him to attempt to blackmail Don Draper with the Dick Whitman information he has learned, but it does not work. He and Don are antagonistic some of the time, but later develop a grudging <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> culminating in Don's approaching Pete over Ken Cosgrove when forming a new agency. Campbell and his wife, Trudy, were unable to conceive a child early in their marriage, and he only learned of his child with Olson at the Season 2 finale. He and Trudy do conceive a daughter, Tammy, late in Season 4. At the end of Season 3, dissatisfied with his treatment at Sterling Cooper regarding a promotion, he secretly plans to leave the firm. Unaware of this, Don Draper approaches Campbell with an offer to join his new firm as long as Pete brings accounts worth $8 million of cash flow. Campbell decides to join Draper, with the condition that he be made a partner, though his surname does not appear in the new firm's name (Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce). Campbell {{is one of the few}} characters in the show who does not smoke cigarettes, though he is seen smoking marijuana on one occasion. He looks up to Don in many ways. Campbell is often shown cheating on his wife, and is not above manipulating and blackmailing women to get them to sleep with him. While Pete and Trudy separate in Season 6 after another one of his affairs, the two reconcile at the end of the series as Pete takes a lucrative offer with Learjet in Wichita, Kansas.|$|E
500|$|From {{the text}} itself, the ending is ambiguous: {{according}} to one view, Batman breaks the Joker's neck out of panel, causing the laughter to stop abruptly. Some people theorise that the title, [...] "The Killing Joke" [...] is {{in reference to the}} ending scene, in which The Joker and Batman laugh, over a joke, thus triggering Batman to kill The Joker. According to another view, Batman and the Joker, who have been fighting for years, end all of their disputes by having a good laugh about it all. Still another theory maintains that the first and last panels of the book are both purposely of rain falling on the ground, which symbolizes that nothing has changed except for the two parties' <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E

500|$|Shego (voiced by Nicole Sullivan): Kim's primary {{combatant}} {{and most}} dangerous opponent; a supervillain with the superhuman {{ability to generate}} powerful green energy blasts from her hands. Shego is Drakken's sarcastic – but far more intelligent – sidekick, who openly mocks the scientist {{with little regard for}} his seniority. The character finds herself making up for Drakken's incompetence on multiple occasions. Originally the lone female member of a team of superheroes known as Team Go alongside her four brothers, Shego eventually makes a full conversion to villainy after ultimately growing attracted to the evil she once fought against (in addition to finding her brothers annoying). Smart, athletic and attractive, Shego is essentially a [...] "dark reflection" [...] of Kim, as well as the only character the heroine truly has reason to fear, although the two archrivals share a mutal <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{called it}} a [...] "particularly strong" [...] episode that used all of the {{characters}} well. Fowler especially liked that although Ron and Leslie bickered throughout the episode, they still displayed a mutual <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> He also said Tom's photography sessions were {{a good way to}} display Ann and Mark's deteriorating relationship. The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler said [...] "Summer Catalog" [...] laid the foundation for several future developments, like changes to the Andy/April and Mark/Ann relationships, but also kept the episode funny and enjoyable. Heisler said Tom had the best lines of the episode. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she was saddened by the decline in Mark and Ann's relationship and the setback for the April and Andy courtship, and feared the subplot might not reach a satisfactory conclusion {{by the end of the}} season. Gallagher also said the mainplot with Leslie and the former park heads was predictable, and that guest star Michael Gross was underused.|$|E
500|$|Following the leak, Kravitz {{discussed}} {{the song in}} a video he uploaded to the social networking site Twitter. He confirmed that he had written, produced and played instruments on the song, as well as record it with Jackson. Kravitz stated {{that he was not}} responsible for the unofficial release, as his copy [...] "has been locked up in a vault". He noted that the two DJs on the snippet were not involved in the recording process, stating, [...] "I don't know what their purpose is, but that person {{has nothing to do with}} the track." [...] Kravitz reflected that working with Jackson had been [...] "one of the most amazing musical experiences" [...] that he had ever had. [...] "It was done by two people who had <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and who love music — that was it." [...] The singer-songwriter concluded that [...] "Another Day" [...] had not been mixed or completed but added that he hoped the full song would be released and heard [...] "the way me and Michael intended it to be".|$|E

5000|$|In 1984, Lydon {{worked with}} Time Zone on their single [...] "World Destruction".

5000|$|Literally, ka- means [...] "co-" [...] and bayan means [...] "town". In {{the narrow}} sense, kababayan means a fellow {{from the same}} town. However, it is often used in a much broader sense to mean countrymen or compatriots, {{especially}} by overseas Filipinos, OFWs, and connotes <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other’s</b> commitment to unity because of their common cultural, political, and religious background from the same [...] "bayan", broadly defined.|$|R
500|$|Although they {{retained}} <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> Hergé's repeated absences {{had created}} a tense situation between himself and Leblanc. After a lengthy search, Leblanc had found a publisher willing to produce an edition of Tintin magazine in France: Georges Dargaud's Le Lombard, which began production of a French edition in October 1948. However, Hergé was unhappy that Leblanc had appointed André Frenez as Van Melkebeke's replacement as editor-in-chief, describing Frenez as [...] "a cold functionary". Hergé was stubborn and uncompromising as the magazine's artistic director, known for strongly criticising the work of old friends like Pierre Ickx if he felt {{that they did not}} meet his exacting standards. He was particularly critical of the work of two of the newly hired staff at Tintin and Kuifje, Jacques Martin and Willy Vandersteen, encouraging them to change their artistic style to better reflect his own preferences. To Leblanc, he expressed the concern that most of those working at Tintin were better illustrators than storytellers. He also opined that Tintin was not keeping up with the times and what he perceived as the increased maturity of children, encouraging the magazine to better reflect current events and scientific developments.|$|E
500|$|Ross favorably {{compared}} the recording sessions to his past in school. He mused, [...] "it's like everybody is a student: You {{walk into a}} session, and it's all about the subject at hand." [...] The remastered album version featured a new guitar solo, composed by producer Bink!. Bink! is most famous for his contributions to Jay-Z's album, The Blueprint, which has been described a [...] "pioneering album" [...] by Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal and was West's big break as a producer. West and Bink! originally became friends while producing another Jay-Z album, [...] in the late 1990s. Bink! described that the two producers quickly developed a mutual <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Bink! commented on {{the first time he}} showed the composition to West, saying [...] "the reaction I got from him after I played the beat for the first time was real intense." [...] Immediately Bink! knew that West was going to use the production. Initially, he wasn't sure whether or how West was going to use the song for his album, and expressed surprise that West dropped the song as a free track prior to the album's release.|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E

Lupe Fiasco then continued {{to fuel the}} fire by responding to King Gordy, the back and forth continued for over eight hours and both rappers explicitly expressed their <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> craft, but insisted they would beat <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in a rap battle.|$|R
