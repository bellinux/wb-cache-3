5|$|Nemesis {{appears on}} the cover of every version of Resident Evil 3, and is {{mentioned}} prominently on flyers for Resident Evil: Survivor 2. Capcom has also released commercial products modeled on the character, such as an adult size Halloween mask, and later a silver ring modeled after Nemesis's head available for purchase through their Japanese online store. Palisades Toys used its likeness to create a posable action figure (packaged with a base and equipable <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher)</b> and a mini bust, which were released alongside several other Resident Evil-based merchandise. Moby Dick released its own line of Resident Evil action figures bundled in pairs of a playable character and enemy. Included in the series were Nemesis's first and second form, with the first form featuring an alternate head and equipable <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher.</b> Each set additionally includes a part of an action figure of Nemesis's third form, which measures 24inches (60cm) long when completed.|$|E

5|$|The GUNT-Libyan {{alliance}} invested on 10 August the Faya-Largeau oasis, where Habré had entrenched {{himself with}} about 5,000 troops. Battered by multiple <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> (MRL), artillery and tank fire and continuous airstrikes, the FANT's defensive line disintegrated when the GUNT launched the final assault, leaving 700 FANT {{troops on the}} ground. Habré escaped with the remnants of his army to the capital, without being pursued by the Libyans.|$|E
5|$|During the {{daylight}} hours, Jericho's powers are gone, {{so he has}} to fight as a normal human, using a wide variety of weaponry, from a Darkwatch's standard-issue 24-shot Redeemer handgun to a crossbow firing explosive arrows and a <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher,</b> as well as melee combat. In some missions, Jericho can drive a Gatling gun-equipped Coyote Steamwagon vehicle; using it or a horse changes perspective to the third-person view. During horse-riding rail shooter sequences, Jericho is granted unlimited ammunition and high attack speed, at the cost of only being able to use the Redeemer.|$|E
5|$|In June 1938, the Soviet Reaction-Engine Scientific Research Institute (RNII) in Moscow was {{authorized}} by the Main Artillery Directorate (GAU) to develop a multiple <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> for the RS-132 aircraft rocket (RS for , 'rocket-powered shell'). I. Gvay led a design team in Chelyabinsk, Russia, which built several prototype launchers firing the modified 132mm M-132 rockets over the sides of ZiS-5 trucks. These proved unstable, and V.N. Galkovskiy proposed mounting the launch rails longitudinally. In August 1939, {{the result was the}} BM-13 (BM stands for Боевая Mашина (translit. Boyevaya Mashina), 'combat vehicle' for M-13 rockets).|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers</b> {{documented in}} imperial China launched fire arrows with launchers constructed of wood, basketry, and bamboo tubes. The <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers</b> divided the fire arrows with frames meant {{to keep the}} arrows separated, and were capable of firing multiple arrow rockets at once. Textual evidence and illustrations of various early <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers</b> {{are found in the}} 11th century Southern Song Dynasty text Wujing Zongyao. The Wujing Zongyao describes a portable rocket arrow carrier consisting of a sling and a bamboo tube.|$|R

5|$|On 29 February a <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> {{similar to}} one seized in the 1999 raid was found near an army base in Dungannon, County Tyrone, and on 15 March three men were arrested {{following}} the discovery of 500lb of home-made explosives when the RUC searched two cars in Hillsborough, County Down. On 6 April a bomb attack took place at Ebrington Barracks in Derry. RIRA members lowered a device consisting of 5lb of homemade explosives over the perimeter fence using ropes, and the bomb subsequently exploded damaging the fence and an unmanned guardhouse.|$|E
5|$|Players use melee attacks, {{firearms}} and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons {{such as the}} Micro Uzi, an M16 rifle and a flamethrower. The game's three-dimension environment allows a first-person view while aiming with the sniper rifle, <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> and the M16 rifle. In addition, the game's combat was reworked to allow players to commit drive-by shootings by facing sideways in a vehicle. The game gives players {{a wide variety of}} weapon options—they can be purchased from local firearms dealers, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.|$|E
5|$|Many Japanese manga and anime {{have also}} adopted the western genre. Yasuhiro Nightow {{is known for}} {{creating}} the space western Trigun. The story's protagonist, Vash the Stampede, is a wandering gunslinger with a dark past. Unlike other violence-themed gunslingers, Vash carries a Shane-like pacifist attitude, and avoids killing men, even dangerous enemies. Behind him is the gun-toting priest named Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who carries with him a heavy machine gun and <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> shaped like a cross. Nicholas is more violent than Vash, and the two would often argue about killing opponents. Other western genre themed manga and anime include Cowboy Bebop and Kino's Journey, who both incorporate knight-errant gunslinger themes.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} E Company platoon joined Vandygriff, the North Koreans {{attacked}} again. The E Company infantrymen had brought no mortars with them-only small arms. In this situation, Vandygriff took a 3.5-inch <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> and fired into the North Korean attackers, {{causing them to}} break off the attack. By now Vandygriff's troops were nearly out of ammunition. He then instructed his men to gather up all the weapons and ammunition from North Korean dead they could reach, and in this manner they obtained for emergency use about 30 to 40 rifles, 5 PPSh-41 guns, and some hand grenades.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanized}} divisions {{were organized}} along the Soviet model with three mechanized infantry regiments, one tank regiment, {{and a full}} complement of 12,000 infantry soldiers, while the armored divisions were composed of 3 tank and one mechanized infantry regiment plus support units. The artillery, antitank, and air defence regiments of divisions provided specialised fire support that enabled motorised rifle and tank regiments to maneuver. The air defense regiments consisted of two anti-aircraft artillery battalions and one surface-to-air missile (SAM) battalion, each composed of several batteries. In the late 1980s the artillery regiments of mechanized and tank divisions included two artillery battalions, one multiple <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> battalion, and one surface-to-surface missile battalion.|$|E
5|$|The player may run, jump, {{or drive}} {{vehicles}} {{to navigate the}} game's world. The player uses melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies.

5|$|In the series' story, the Nemesis is {{the result}} of infecting a Tyrant — a {{humanoid}} bio-weapon created to be the ultimate lifeform—with a parasitic organism designed to increase its intelligence. Upon infection, the parasite takes control of the Tyrant's nervous system, forming its own brain and enabling it to follow precise instructions and make decisions without a need for constant direction. Clothed in black trousers, an overcoat, boots, and gloves, the Nemesis is armed with a <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> mounted on its left arm. To emphasize its design as a prototype, the game developers left exposed muscles on its body and added stitches to cover the right eye. Upon spotting its target, it says the target's name out loud and attacks.|$|E
5|$|Now {{possessing}} three powers, Delsin encounters Hank, who {{has escaped}} again. Hank tells Delsin that Fetch and Eugene have been {{captured by the}} D.U.P., and are being held on an artificial concrete island in Puget Sound. However, the situation {{turns out to be}} a trap set by Augustine. Reggie appears and rescues Delsin with a <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher.</b> While the brothers free Fetch and Eugene, Augustine encases Reggie's feet in concrete and blasts them off the platform. As they dangle above the ocean, Reggie realizes that Delsin cannot save both of them, tells him that he is proud of him, and lets Delsin's hand go and falls to his death. Distraught and enraged, Delsin climbs back up onto the platform and battles Augustine, destroying the entire island.|$|E
5|$|Saints Row IV was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in North America on August 20, 2013, and worldwide on three days later. Preorders included a patriot-themed downloadable content pack that included flamethrower, dubstep, and <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> weapons, a bald eagle jet, and an Uncle Sam outfit. A limited edition {{release of the}} game included {{a replica of the}} game's dubstep gun, a doomsday button, and Johnny Gat statuette. Another limited edition release, the Game of the Generation Edition, included the previous items as well as a display case for the game. The game was originally refused ratings classification and effectively banned in Australia, but was later accepted when modified to remove an optional mission that involved an anal probe weapon and incentivized drug use. The country's PlayStation 4 release was later recalled due to a classification error.|$|E

5|$|The {{player can}} {{use a variety of}} {{firearms}} to defeat enemies, ranging from pistols to a <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher.</b> Aside from enemies, parts of the environment, such as explosive barrels, can be targeted and shot at, causing them to explode and damage nearby enemies. The game also introduces the ability for players to dodge attacks or perform a quick 180 degree turn to evade enemies. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Health is regained with first aid sprays, as well as herbs, which can be used separately or mixed together to increase their healing effect. The game also features an ammunition creation system that allows players to create new ammunition from different varieties of gunpowder. In addition to engaging in combat, the player must often solve puzzles that focus on logical and conceptual challenges.|$|E
5|$|A {{cover system}} {{can be used in}} combat as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a laser cannon can be transformed into a wire cutting tool.|$|E
5|$|During certain {{situations}} the player {{will be put}} in a perilous situation, where they will be prompted to choose between two possible actions or suffer a certain penalty, if not instant death. These choices affect how the story unfolds and which ending is achieved. Additionally, a creature called Nemesis is encountered multiple times throughout the game as a recurring boss. Nemesis is considerably more powerful than the player and has the ability to use a <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> as a weapon, dodge incoming fire, and pursue the player from one area to the next. During one of these encounters, the player can choose to either fight Nemesis or run until he is evaded. A variety of encounters are possible, with some being mandatory, and some varying in nature and location based on certain choices made by the player. Even if evaded or defeated during one of these encounters, Nemesis will inevitably continue to pursue the player {{until the end of the}} game.|$|E
