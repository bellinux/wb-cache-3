50|$|For years American {{farmers have}} practiced <b>row</b> <b>cropping,</b> with {{crops such as}} sorghum and corn. Because of this, much {{is known about the}} effect of these {{practices}} on wildlife. The most significant effect of increased corn ethanol would be the additional land {{that would have to be}} converted to agricultural use and the increased erosion and fertilizer use that goes along with agricultural production. Increasing our ethanol production through the use of corn could produce negative effects on wildlife, the magnitude of which will depend on the scale of production and whether the land used for this increased production was formerly idle, in a natural state, or planted with other row crops.Another consideration is whether to plant a switchgrass monoculture or use a variety of grasses and other vegetation. While a mixture of vegetation types likely would provide better wildlife habitat, the technology has not yet developed to allow the processing of a mixture of different grass species or vegetation types into bioethanol. Of course, cellulosic ethanol production is still in its infancy, and the possibility of using diverse vegetation stands instead of monocultures deserves further exploration as research continues.|$|E

Three maturity classes of corn, sorghum and soybeans were grown under irrigated and nonirrigated conditions. The production and quality of grain produced by different <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> was determined. ^ Winter wheat was planted immediately after <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> harvest. Oats were planted the spring following <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> harvest. Small grain seedbed preparation was accomplished by plowing and/or discing the <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> residue to prepare an adequate seedbed while maintaining a residue cover. The effects of previous <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> on the small grain seeding operation, growth and production were determined. ^ Irrigated <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> produced larger amounts of grain than nonirrigated <b>row</b> <b>crops.</b> Variation about the mean was greater with irrigated crops as production was {{at a higher level}} than nonirrigated crops. Corn yield increased more with irrigation than sorghum and soybean yields. <b>Row</b> <b>crop</b> maturity class was related to grain production only in corn where grain yield was greater with later hybrids. Early season <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> cultivars tended to produce grain with lower test weights than full season cultivars. ^ <b>Row</b> <b>crop</b> residue did not affect the small grain seeding operation unless soil surface cover exceeded forty-five percent which occurred only following corn and sorghum and substantially slowed seeding operations. Previous <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> affected wheat stand density only when the <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> were not irrigated. Wheat stands following nonirrigated soybeans contained 15 to 20 % more seedling plants than wheat after corn or sorghum. ^ Visual vigor ratings based on ground cover and plant height of oats following nonirrigated crops, and wheat after irrigated and nonirrigated row corps, were not affected by previous <b>row</b> <b>crop.</b> Oats were more vigorous when preceded by irrigated soybeans compared with oats following irrigated corn or sorghum. Oats following soybeans had superior vigor ratings and high early dry matter production. ^ Wheat dry matter production at harvest was highest when preceded by irrigated corn. No differences in wheat dry matter production were detected when wheat was preceded by nonirrigated <b>row</b> <b>crops.</b> ^ Total nitrogen in the herbage and percent IVDMD of small grains was not influenced by preceding <b>row</b> <b>crop.</b> As small grains matured IVDMD declined. ^ Winter wheat was killed by low temperatures during the 1978 - 79 winter. Spring oat production and grain test weight were not affected by previous <b>row</b> <b>crop.</b> Moisture or temperature stress on small grains was not encountered in 1979. Grain yields averaged 21. 9 q/ha and weighed 38. 7 kg/hl. ^ Moisture and temperature stress was severe during the period of active growth of the small grains in 1980. Wheat and oats following irrigated corn and sorghum had greater yield reductions than small grains following irrigated soybeans. Wheat produced 35. 0 q/hl of grain weighing 78 kg/hl while oats produced 21. 6 q/ha of grain that weighed 41. 0 kg/hl after irrigated soybeans. Wheat and oat production after irrigated soybeans was 20 and 100 % higher than wheat and oat yields after irrigated corn or sorghum.

40|$|Wide rows {{essentially}} ensure some {{temporal and}} spatial water availability in water-limiting crop environments, thus minimising the risk of water deficits at critical crop growth stages to ensure profitable yields (Whish et al., 2005). Presence of weeds will {{have a major impact}} on water availability to crops irrespective of planting geometries. Decreasing crop plant population and increasing row spacing decreases crop competitive ability against weeds, and generally wider row spacing will reduce crop competition for homogeneously distributed production factors, as postulated mathematically by Fischer and Miles, (1973). Hence good weed management becomes critical to the success of wide row systems, as failure to control water-using weeds defeats the purpose of wide <b>row</b> <b>cropping</b> where water conservation is the focus.

The two wheat varieties (Falat and Orom) were sown based on a Randomized Completed Block Design with 12 treatments and three replicates.

40|$|Research in Western Australia (WA) for {{the last}} few years reveals that in the warm and low {{rainfall}} environments of the northern agricultural region, wide rows (50 cm or more) can produce better lupin yields than narrow rows (25 cm or less) due to improved soil-crop water relations. However, in the broader sense the influence of wide <b>row</b> <b>cropping</b> on crop nutrition and nutrient management is still largely unknown in WA cropping systems. The simulation model, ROOTMAP can be used as a tool to understand the interactions between root systems and availability of soil water and nutrient in the rooting environment, and develop research hypotheses that can be tested under field conditions to develop better nutrient management practices for wide <b>row</b> <b>cropping.</b> ROOTMAP was parameterised for a deep yellow sandy soil from Moora, WA to simulate soil water dynamics and lupin root growth. Two contrasting seasons (wet vs. dry) in Moora were chosen when conducting the two simulation case studies. In the first case study, 8 simulated treatments were designed to evaluate lupin root growth in the rows and between the rows and P uptake when the row spacing and P fertilisation rate below seeds were altered in both dry and wet seasons. The second case study was designed to explore root growth response and P uptake, when P fertiliser was banded in the rows and at 8, 13, 18 and 23 cm away from the rows using a 50 cm row spacing. The simulations suggest that in wide <b>row</b> <b>cropping,</b> where lupin plants are planted closely in the seeding rows, having sufficient P supply in the rows is critical to reduce competition among roots for soil P, to improve penetration and proliferation of the roots into deep soil layers, and to encourage root growth and proliferation between the rows.
