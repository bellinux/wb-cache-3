500|$|The {{division}} {{among the}} generals {{came to a}} head {{at a meeting of the}} MRC on August 26–27. Khánh said the instability was due to troublemaking by members and supporters of the Catholic-aligned Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam), whom he accused of putting partisan plotting ahead of the national interest. Prominent officers associated with the Đại Việt included Thieu and Khiêm. Khiêm blamed Khánh's weakness in dealing with Buddhist activists for the demonstrations in the cities and the rural losses to the communists. Thieu and another Catholic General Nguyễn Hữu Có called for the replacement of Khánh with Minh, but the latter refused. Minh claimed that Khánh was the only one who would get funding from Washington, so they should support him, prompting Khiêm to angrily say [...] "Obviously, Khánh is a puppet of the US government, and we are tired of being told by the Americans how we should <b>run</b> <b>our</b> internal affairs." [...] Feeling pressured by the strong condemnations of his colleagues, Khánh promised to resign, but no replacement was agreed upon and another meeting was convened.|$|E

2500|$|The {{division}} {{among the}} generals {{came to a}} head {{at a meeting of the}} MRC on 26–27 August. Khánh and Khiêm blamed one another for the increasing unrest across the nation. Thiệu and another Catholic, General Nguyễn Hữu Có, called for the replacement of Khánh with Minh, but the latter refused. Minh reportedly claimed that Khánh was the only one who would get financial assistance from Washington, so they supported him, prompting Khiêm to angrily say, [...] "Obviously, Khánh is a puppet of the U.S. government, and we are tired of being told by the Americans how we should <b>run</b> <b>our</b> internal affairs". Khánh said that he would resign, but no agreement over the leadership could be found, and after more arguing between the senior officers, on 27 August they agreed that Khánh, Minh, and Khiêm would rule as a triumvirate for two months, until a new civilian government could be formed. The trio then brought paratroopers into Saigon to end the rioting. However, the triumvirate did little due to their disunity. Khánh dominated the decision-making and sidelined Khiêm and Minh.|$|E
2500|$|Netflix has {{strayed from}} the {{traditional}} necessary production of a pilot episode {{in order to establish}} the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards, [...] "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've <b>run</b> <b>our</b> data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series." [...] Though traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, Spacey points out that in 2012, 113 pilots were made, 35 of those were chosen to go to air, 13 of those were renewed, and most of those are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for House of Cards extremely cost effective. Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they are free from needing to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to traditional pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2012, Greg Smith, then-head of Goldman Sachs US equity {{derivatives}} sales {{business in}} Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), resigned his position via a critical letter printed as an op-ed in The New York Times. In the letter, he attacked Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Lloyd Blankfein for losing {{touch with the}} company's culture, which he described as [...] "the secret sauce that made this place great and allowed us to earn our clients' trust for 143 years." [...] Smith said that advising clients [...] "to do what I believe is right for them" [...] was becoming increasingly unpopular. Instead there was a [...] "toxic and destructive" [...] environment in which [...] "the interests of the client continue to be sidelined", senior management described clients as [...] "" [...] and colleagues callously talked about [...] "ripping their clients off". In reply, Goldman Sachs said that [...] "we will only be successful if our clients are successful", claiming [...] "this fundamental truth {{lies at the heart}} of how we conduct ourselves" [...] and that [...] "we don't think [...] reflect the way we <b>run</b> <b>our</b> business." [...] Later that year, Smith published a book titled Why I left Goldman Sachs.|$|E
