25|$|There are differing {{estimates}} of the total capital held by Iranian expatriates. One estimate places the number at $1.3 trillion US dollars. Whatever the actual number, {{it is clear that}} these funds are sufficiently large enough to buy significant stakes in all state companies. In Dubai alone, Iranian expatriates are estimated to have invested up to $200 billion. Even a 10 percent <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> would have a significant impact. In 2000, the Iran Press Service reported that Iranian expatriates had invested between $200 and $400 billion in the United States, Europe, and China, but almost nothing in Iran.

40|$|Abstract: Despite the {{substantial}} recent {{increase in capital}} flows to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the sub-continent remains largely marginalized in financial globalization and chronically dependent on official development aid. The current debate on resource mobilization for development financing in Africa has overlooked the problem <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> flight, which constitutes an important untapped source of funds. This paper argues that <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> flight <b>capital</b> deserves more attention on economic as well as moral grounds. On the moral side, {{the argument is that}} a large proportion <b>of</b> the <b>capital</b> flight legitimately belongs to the African people and therefore must be restituted to the legitimate claimants. The economic argument is that <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> flight <b>capital</b> will contribute to propelling the sub-continent on a higher sustainable growth path while preserving its financial stability and independence and without mortgaging the welfare of its future generations through external borrowing.

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{increase}} in capital flows to Sub-Saharan Africa, the region remains largely marginalized in financial globalization and chronically dependent on official development aid. And with the potential decline {{in the level of}} official development assistance in a context of global financial crisis, the need to increase domestic resources mobilization as well as non-debt generating external resources is critical now more than ever before. However, the debate on resource mobilization has overlooked an important untapped source of funds consisting of the massive stocks of private wealth stashed in Western financial centers, a substantial part of which left the region in the form <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> flight. This paper argues that the <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> flight <b>capital</b> should take a more prominent place in this debate from a moral standpoint and for clear economic reasons. On the moral side, the argument is that a large proportion <b>of</b> the <b>capital</b> flight legitimately belongs to the Africans and therefore must be restituted to the legitimate claimants. The economic argument is that <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> flight <b>capital</b> will propel the sub-continent on a higher sustainable growth path while preserving its financial stability and without mortgaging the welfare of its future generations through external borrowing. The analysis in the paper demonstrates quantitatively that the gains from repatriation are large and dominate the expected benefits from other sources such as debt relief. It is estimated that if only a quarter of the stock <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> flight was repatriated to Sub-Saharan Africa, the region would go from trailing to leading other developing regions in terms of domestic investment, thus initiating a ‘big-push’-led sustainable long-term economic growth. The paper proposes some strategies for inducing capital flight repatriation, but cautions that the success of this program is contingent on strong political will on the part of African and Western governments and effective coordination and cooperation at the global level.

40|$|This study {{examines}} capital flows and shifts in capital account and exchange rate regimes in African countries {{over the past}} two decades. The evidence shows that official lending to Africa has declined while the volume <b>of</b> private <b>capital</b> flows remains low and significantly below the levels observed in other developing regions. Private capital inflows to Africa are limited due to several factors, including the weakness of the macroeconomic environment, underdeveloped financial systems, high country risk, and exchange rate misalignments. The focus of policy reforms must be on alleviating these constraints in order to attract more foreign capital and overcome the shortage of development financing. Many African countries have pursued reforms aimed at liberalizing their capital account and exchange rate regimes. However, liberalization has not been accompanied by systematic gains income growth, price stability, and trade performance. African countries must pay serious attention to the scope, speed, and sequencing <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> account liberalization to minimize potential adverse effects of openness. It is desirable for countries to maintain selective discretionary control over capital movements and exchange rate markets in order to hedge against adverse shocks to the economy and to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability. To attract foreign capital, any move toward capital account openness and exchange rate liberalization must be supported by reforms aimed at improving credibility of macroeconomic policy and establishing an investment-friendly environment. These reforms will not only attract foreign capital but also encourage domestic investment. An important aspect <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> movements in Africa is the high level <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> flight. There is an urgent need for policies to stem further hemorrage <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> from Africa and induce the <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> private <b>capital</b> held abroad. This will require not only improvement of the macroeconomic conditions to ameliorate incentives for domestic investment, but also reform of the political and legal systems to improve accountability and credibility of economic policy. ...|$|R

40|$|Formerly a {{favourite}} {{location for}} private capital inflows, Brazil was virtually {{cut off from}} further bank lending in the 1980 s. The country's rating in secondary loan markets plummeted, and foreign direct investment dwindled. New external financing was replaced by an accumulation of interest arrears. Retained resources were used for consumption or fueled capital flight, rather than being used for productive investment. Brazil is significantly lagging behind Asian and Latin American competitors in facing the fiercer worldwide competition for foreign capital. The seriously impaired attractiveness in international capital markets is to be attributed to pronounced macroeconomic instability, excessive government interference into goods and factor markets, as well as confrontation with commmercial lenders and restrictive attitudes towards foreign investors. After having lost one decade, Brazil should not risk another one. The country should {{follow the example of}} Chile and Mexico, where the implementation of domestic policy reforms was supported by voluntary debt-service concessions of external creditors. This cooperative approach lowered the perception of country risk, led to the <b>repatriation</b> <b>of</b> flight <b>capital,</b> and triggered a favourable investment response. Domestic policy reforms are indispensable for regaining access to international capital markets. The centerpiece of macroeconomic stabilization in Brazil must be to break inflationary expectations through sustained fiscal consolidation. Recent progress in dismantling trade barriers must be supplemented by abandoning the tradition of interventionist price policies in domestic goods markets. The deep-rooted structural deficiencies of labour and financial markets have to be tackled, in order to stimulate human capital formation and enhance efficient financial intermediation. [...] ...|$|R
