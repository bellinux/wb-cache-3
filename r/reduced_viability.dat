5|$|Since 1988, the American {{black duck}} has been rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This {{is because the}} range of this species is {{extremely}} large, which is not near the threshold of vulnerable species. In addition, the total population is large, and, although it is declining, it is not declining fast {{enough to make the}} species vulnerable. It has long been valued as a game bird, being extremely wary and fast flying. Habitat loss due to drainage, filling of wetlands due to urbanization, global warming and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population. Some conservationists consider hybridization and competition with the mallard as an additional source of concern should this decline continue. Hybridization itself is not a major problem; natural selection makes sure that the best-adapted individuals have the most offspring. However, the <b>reduced</b> <b>viability</b> of female hybrids causes some broods to fail in the long run due to the death of the offspring before reproducing themselves. While this is not a problem in the plentiful mallard, it might place an additional strain on the American black duck's population. Recent research conducted for the Delta Waterfowl Foundation suggests that hybrids are a result of forced copulations and not a normal pairing choice by black hens.|$|E
25|$|In wildlife, {{exposure}} to EDCs {{can result in}} altered fertility, <b>reduced</b> <b>viability</b> of offspring, impaired hormone secretion or activity and modified reproductive anatomy. The reproductive anatomy of offspring can particularly be affected if maternal exposure occurs. In females, this includes mammary glands, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina. In males, this includes the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymitis and testes. Exposure of fish to EDCs has also been associated with abnormal thyroid function, decreased fertility, decreased hatching success, de-feminization and masculinization of female fish and alteration of immune function.|$|E
50|$|Antioxidant {{pathways}} {{were first}} recognised as a chokepoints for schistosomes and later extended to other trematodes and cestodes. Targeting of this pathway with different inhibitors {{of the central}} antioxidant enzyme thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR) results in <b>reduced</b> <b>viability</b> of worms.|$|E
40|$|A cell permeabilization {{procedure}} is described that <b>reduces</b> <b>viability</b> less than 10 % {{and does not}} significantly reduce the rates of ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis when appropriately supplemented. Permeabilization abolishes the normal stringent coupling of protein and ribonucleic acid synthesis...|$|R
50|$|Disappearing or {{diminishing}} {{populations of}} whelks {{have been observed}} since the early 1970s, especially in the North Sea and the Wadden Sea. Additionally, vast beds of empty shells have been discovered where no living whelks are present. Imposex, the occurrence of male gonads on female whelks, has been detected since the early 1990s, and {{is thought to be}} a product of the shipping industry. Specifically, TBT has been shown to <b>reduce</b> <b>viability</b> of whelk populations.|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the effect of continuous perfusion with antifungals on Candida albicans biofilms under conditions of flow, closely mimicking physiological conditions encountered within patients. Biofilms displayed high levels of resistance to fluconazole, and this antifungal exerted minor effects on dispersion levels. Amphotericin B proved effective in <b>reducing</b> <b>viability</b> of cells within the biofilms and dispersion, but only at high concentrations. Under flow conditions, caspofungin exhibited potent activity against biofilms and drastically reduced biofilm dispersion...|$|R
50|$|Deficiency of {{the enzyme}} {{can be studied}} in the model {{organism}} Caenorhabditis elegans. The rad-6 strain has a premature stop codon eliminating the orotidine 5’-decarboxylase domain of the protein; this domain does not occur in any other proteins encoded by the genome. The strain has a pleiotropic phenotype including <b>reduced</b> <b>viability</b> and fertility, slow growth, and radiation sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|A double {{mutation}} {{results in}} TRS-1 (ACGGAT) and a triple mutation results in TRS-2 (CCGGAT). When the remodeled TRS circuit containing viruses are genetically recombined with wild type TRS circuits, {{the result is}} a circuit reduced in production of subgenomic mRNA. The goal of modifying the SARS virus with this approach is to produce chimeric progeny that have <b>reduced</b> <b>viability</b> due to the incompatibility of the WT and engineered TRS circuits.|$|E
50|$|Loss of {{a single}} UBC allele has no {{apparent}} phenotype, while homozygous deletion of UBC gene leads to mid-gestation embryonic lethality due to a defect in fetal liver development, {{as well as a}} delay in cell-cycle progression and increased susceptibility to cellular stress. It is also reported that homozygous deletion of UBC gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts will cause decreased cellular Ub level and <b>reduced</b> <b>viability</b> under oxidative stress.|$|E
40|$|Paraquat and diquat are {{of similar}} {{toxicity}} to rat alveolar and peritoneal macrophages in tissue culture. Irreversible damage to macrophages occurs after exposure of 30 min to paraquat or diquat at concentrations {{as low as}} 10 - 6 mol/l, resulting in the uptake of vital dye. Paraquat and diquat at concentrations of 10 - 5 mol/l or less do not <b>reduce</b> <b>viability</b> of fibroblasts as measured by dye exclusion but reduce cloning efficiency. The toxicity of diquat to fibroblasts is approximately ten-fold {{greater than that of}} paraquat...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{advances}} in treatment and outcomes {{for patients with}} pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), there continue to be subsets of patients who are refractory to standard chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Therefore, novel gene targets for therapy are needed to further advance treatment for this disease. RNA interference technology has identified survivin as a potential therapeutic target. Survivin, {{a member of the}} inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins and chromosome passenger complex, is expressed in hematologic malignancies and overexpressed in relapsed pediatric ALL. Our studies show that survivin is uniformly expressed at high levels in multiple pediatric ALL cell lines. Furthermore, silencing of survivin expression in pediatric ALL cell lines as well as primary leukemic blasts <b>reduces</b> <b>viability</b> of these cells. This includes cell lines derived from patients with relapsed disease featuring cytogenetic anomalies such as t(12; 21), Philadelphia chromosome t(9; 22), t(1; 19) as well as a cell line carrying t(17; 19) from a patient with de novo ALL. Furthermore, inhibition of survivin increases p 53 -dependent apoptosis that can be rescued by inhibition of p 53. Finally, a screen of randomly selected primary patient samples confirms that survivin-specific small interfering RNA and survivin-targeted drug, YM 155, effectively <b>reduce</b> <b>viability</b> of leukemic blasts...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of a “post-antibiotic era” in the 21 st century, in which common infections may kill, has prompted research into radically new antimicrobials. CO-releasing molecules (CORMs), mostly metal carbonyl compounds, originally developed for therapeutic CO delivery in animals, are potent antimicrobial agents. Certain CORMs inhibit growth and respiration, <b>reduce</b> <b>viability,</b> and release CO to intracellular hemes, as predicted, but their actions are more complex, as revealed by transcriptomic datasets and modeling. Progress is hindered by difficulties in detecting CO release intracellularly, limited understanding of the biological chemistry of CO reactions with non-heme targets, and the cytotoxicity of some CORMs to mammalian cells...|$|R
5000|$|Conditions within blizzards {{often include}} large {{quantities}} of blowing snow and strong winds which may significantly reduce visibility. <b>Reduced</b> <b>viability</b> of personnel on foot may result in extended exposure to the blizzard and increase the chance of becoming lost. The strong winds associated with blizzards create wind chill that can result in frostbites and hypothermia. The strong winds present in blizzards are capable of damaging plants and may cause power outrages, frozen pipes, and cut off fuel lines ...|$|E

50|$|A type of {{incompatibility}} that {{is found}} as often in plants as in animals {{occurs when the}} egg or ovule is fertilized but the zygote does not develop, or it develops and the resulting individual has a <b>reduced</b> <b>viability.</b> This {{is the case for}} crosses between species of the frog genus, where widely differing results are observed depending of the species involved. In some crosses there is no segmentation of the zygote (or {{it may be that the}} hybrid is extremely non-viable and changes occur from the first mitosis). In others, normal segmentation occurs in the blastula but gastrulation fails. Finally, in other crosses, the initial stages are normal but errors occur in the final phases of embryo development. This indicates differentiation of the embryo development genes (or gene complexes) in these species and these differences determine the non-viability of the hybrids.|$|E
40|$|Survival of Rhizobium meliloti 102 F 5 in {{aerosols}} at 20 C was maximal at high {{relative humidity}} (RH) and minimal at low RH. Relatively {{high concentrations of}} NO 2, SO 2, or formaldehyde were needed to significantly <b>reduce</b> <b>viability</b> of R. meliloti in aerosols at 50 % RH. Except for the reduction in activity of formaldehyde by SO 2, there was no additive or antagonistic effect of mixing pollutants. High environmental RH enhanced bactericidal activity of NO 2 and SO 2.

50|$|Animals {{living in}} {{contaminated}} areas {{in and around}} Chernobyl have suffered {{from a variety of}} side effects caused by radiation. Oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants have had severe consequences {{on the development of the}} nervous system, including reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities. It has been found that birds living in areas with high levels of radiation have statistically significantly smaller brains, which has shown to be a deficit to viability in the wild. Barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) that live in or around Chernobyl have displayed an increased rate of physical abnormalities compared to swallows from uncontaminated areas. Abnormalities included partially albinistic plumage, deformed toes, tumors, deformed tail feathers, deformed beaks, and deformed air sacks. Birds with these abnormalities have a <b>reduced</b> <b>viability</b> in the wild and a decrease in fitness. Moeller et al. claimed in 2007 that these effects were likely due to radiation exposure and elevated teratogenic effects of radioactive isotopes in the environment although these conclusions have been challenged. Various birds in the area appear to have adapted to lower levels of radiation by producing more antioxidants, such as glutathione, to help mitigate the oxidative stress.|$|E
5000|$|One study, using {{relevant}} {{life history}} {{data from the}} Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) predicts that a transgene introduced into a natural population by {{a small number of}} transgenic fish will spread as a result of enhanced mating advantage, but the <b>reduced</b> <b>viability</b> of offspring will cause eventual local extinction of both populations. GM coho salmon show greater risk-taking behaviour and better use of limited food than wild-type fish. Transgenic coho salmon have enhanced feeding capacity and growth, which can result in a considerably larger body size (>7-fold) compared to non-transgenic salmon. When transgenic and non-transgenic salmon in the same enclosure compete for different levels of food, transgenic individuals consistently outgrow non-transgenic individuals. When food abundance is low, dominant individuals emerge, invariably transgenic, that show strong agonistic and cannibalistic behavior to cohorts and dominate the acquisition of limited food resources. When food availability is low, all groups containing transgenic salmon experience population crashes or complete extinctions, whereas groups containing only non-transgenic salmon have good (72%) survival rates. [...] This has led to the suggestion that these GM fish will survive better than the wild-type when conditions are very poor.|$|E
50|$|CBFβ-SMMHC outcompetes CBFβ for binding to RUNX1 {{by direct}} protein-protein interaction. Using a {{fluorescence}} resonance energy transfer (FRET) based assay, AI-4-57 was discovered {{as the lead}} compound which can inhibit CBFβ-SMHHC -RUNX1 protein-protein interaction. To get good in vivo pharmacokinetics, selectivity and potency AI-10-49 was developed which has a seven atom polyethylene glycol-based linker and a trifluoromethoxy substitution. This molecule releases RUNX1 from CBFβ-SMHHC specifically and restores the RUNX1 transcriptional program in inv(16) positive human leukemic cells. Viability assays showed AI-10-49 has an IC50 of 0.6µM. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that AI-10-49 has half-life of 380 minutes in mouse plasma. AI-10-49 prolonged the survival of mice transplanted with CBFβ-SMHHC leukemic cells without any signs of toxicity. AI-10-49 <b>reduced</b> <b>viability</b> and colony forming ability of human primary inv(16) leukemic blast cells, without affecting normal human bone marrow cells as wells non- inv(16) primary human leukemic blast cells. Overall, these findings validate inhibition of RUNX1- CBFβ-SMMHC protein-protein interaction as a novel therapeutic avenue for leukemia with inv(16) and AI-10-49 as a specific inhibitor of CBFβ-SMHHC oncoprotein. The discovery of AI-10-49 provides additional evidence that transcription factor drivers of cancer can be directly targeted. AI-10-49 belongs to {{a select group of}} protein-protein interaction inhibitors that has been shown to have specific and potent efficiency without toxicity in cancer therapy.|$|E

40|$|Background. Although many {{patients}} with multivessel {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) and severely depressed left ventricular (LV) function will benefit from {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery (CABG), surgeons may be reluctant to perform CABG on these patients without evidence of myocardial viability in regions of severe asynergy. We hypothesized that quantitative planar rest-redistribution 2 `Tl imaging would identify viable myocardium and predict improved regional and global function after revascular-ization in patients with depressed LV function and CAD. Methods and Results. Twenty-one patients (mean LV ejection fraction, 0. 27 ± 0. 05) were studied. Regional and global LV functions were evaluated before and 8 weeks after CABG with radionuclide ventriculog-raphy. Segments were prospectively classified as showing normal, mildly reduced, or severely <b>reduced</b> <b>viability</b> on the basis of quantitative analysis of defect severity and redistribution on planar resting ' 1 Tl imaging.

40|$|AbstractPrefibrillar {{cytotoxicity}} {{was suggested}} {{as a common}} amyloid characteristic. We showed two types of albebetin prefibrillar oligomers are formed during incubation at pH 7. 3. Initial round-shaped oligomers consist of 10 – 15 molecules determined by atomic force microscopy, do not bind thioflavin-T and do not affect viability of granular neurons and SH-SY 5 Y cells. They are converted into ca. 30 – 40 -mers possessing cross-β-sheet and <b>reducing</b> <b>viability</b> of neuronal cells. Neither monomers nor fibrils possess cytotoxicity.
