40|$|Abstract. In {{the current}} {{environment}} of energy saving, dumper run energy efficiently that has great practical significance. The drive motor speed determines the <b>roll-over</b> <b>machine</b> efficiency, {{with the result}} that motor speed optimal control using adaptive PID control system. Contrary to the volume of PID control, using neural network online-tuning; On hand of network selection, RBFNN and F-RBFNN are selected. Compared with the classical PID control, the PID control based on F-RBFNN and RBFNN achieve the amount of online tuning the parameters of PID control. Especially, compared with RBFNN, F-RBFNN which combines a fuzzy logic technology and RBFNN is more suitable for real-time nonlinear control of the roll drive motor speed. Because parameters tuning more rapidly and static and dynamic performance and anti-interference ability more powerfully...|$|E
