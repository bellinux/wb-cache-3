40|$|Abstract- This {{study shows}} that a precise eye {{tracking}} and pupillometer system, neither interfering visual field nor influenced by head movement, can be implemented by analyzing first Paikinje image of visual field which has a few <b>reference</b> <b>points.</b> If two or more <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> are sited around the center of visual field, then eye camera captures the overlapped image of <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> and pupil. Four high intensity infra-red light-emitting diodes (IR LEDs) are used as <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> in this study not to disturb the subject’s attention. These <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> appear as four highlighting points in the captured pupil image. The actual gazing point can be calculated by finding {{the distance between the}} center of these four <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> and pupil center and angle.

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of camera external orientation {{with respect to}} a known object is one of the central problems in photogrammetry and computer vision. In recent years this problem is gaining an increasing attention in the field of UAV autonomous flight. Such application requires a real-time performance and robustness of the external orientation estimation algorithm. The accuracy of the solution is strongly dependent on the number of <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> visible on the given image. The problem only has an analytical solution if 3 or more <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> are visible. However, in limited visibility conditions it is often needed to perform external orientation with only 2 visible <b>reference</b> <b>points.</b> In such case the solution could be found if the gravity vector direction in the camera coordinate system is known. A number of algorithms for external orientation estimation for the case of 2 known <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> and a gravity vector were developed to date. Most of these algorithms provide analytical solution in the form of polynomial equation that is subject to large errors in the case of complex <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> configurations. This paper is focused on {{the development of a new}} computationally effective and robust algorithm for external orientation based on positions of 2 known <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> and a gravity vector. The algorithm implementation for guidance of a Parrot AR. Drone 2. 0 micro-UAV is discussed.

5|$|During the 18th century, {{systems of}} plant {{identification}} were developed comparable to dichotomous keys, where unidentified plants are placed into taxonomic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) {{by making a}} series of choices between pairs of characters.

By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 Carl von Linné (Carl Linnaeus) published his Species Plantarum, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus. For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, Cryptogamia, included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{estimated that}} oil would average $124 a barrel {{for the year}} {{but as a result}} of lower oil production, caused by maintenance of two of the three offshore oil rigs, the province would record a deficit of $258 million. Marshall stated that while he could have eliminated the deficit in one year through cuts, the government decided that they would run a deficit for two years before going back to surpluses. The government also announced that over the next 10 years they would embark on a “core mandate analysis” to restrain growth in program spending to the rate of inflation, and reduce Newfoundland and Labrador’s debt level to the all-province average. Just three months after the budget was delivered Dunderdale announced that the government would cut back on travel and leave some vacant positions unfilled due to a drop in oil prices. On the day of her news conference brent crude, a close <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> for oil produced offshore Newfoundland, stood at $103 a barrel, which was up from $90 the previous month. For every $1 drop in the price of oil below government estimates results in nearly $20 million less being funnelled into the provincial treasury, which meant the deficit for the year was expected to climb by several hundred million dollars. By the time Finance Minister Marshall released his mid-year economic update on December 13, 2012, it was estimated that the deficit would total $726 million for that fiscal year.|$|E
40|$|Affine {{invariant}} point-set matching is {{an important}} issue in computer vision and pattern recognition. Using <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> derived from the convex hull of the point-set is an existing idea to solve this problem. However, how to choose proper and enough <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> for extracting affine invariant and powerful discriminative descriptors is an open problem. In this paper, a novel method termed convex hull bisection (CHB) is proposed for affine invariant point-set matching. In CHB, for each point in the point-set, two <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> are derived by bisecting the convex hull using the line connecting the point and the centroid of the convex hull. The resulting <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> and other <b>reference</b> <b>points,</b> such as the centroid point of the convex hull and the mean point of the point-set, are utilised to yield an 11 -dimensional affine invariant feature vector associated with any point within the point-set. The obtained point based descriptors are used for point-set matching. The proposed method works well even in the case that <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> are overlapping or collinear, which overcomes the limitations of the existing convex hull based methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by an extensive experimental investigation. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R
