50|$|Repudiation of the {{contract}} by one party entitles the other party the right to terminate and claim for damages. However, {{it is possible that}} the <b>repudiating</b> <b>party</b> does not <b>repudiate</b> the entire contract but only certain obligations. In this case, the aggrieved party will only acquire the right to terminate if the <b>repudiating</b> <b>party</b> <b>repudiates</b> an obligation which, if breached, would grant a right to terminate.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Repudiation and retraction== A <b>party</b> is {{considered}} to have <b>repudiated</b> a contract when they evidence a lack of willingness or an inability to perform their contractual obligations. A repudiation of a contract by one <b>party</b> (the <b>repudiating</b> <b>party)</b> will entitle the other party (the aggrieved party) to elect to terminate the contract. This is based on objective intentions i.e. the <b>repudiating</b> <b>party's</b> words or conduct.; This unwillingness or inability to perform a condition must deprive the aggrieved party of substantially {{the whole of the}} benefit that they would have received if the remaining obligations were performed under the contract. When such an event occurs, the performing party to the contract is excused from having to fulfill his or her obligations. However, the repudiation can be retracted by the promising party so long as there has been no material change in the position of the performing party in the interim. A retraction of the repudiation restores the performer's obligation to perform on the contract.|$|R
50|$|In 1974 the Ulster Unionist <b>Party</b> <b>repudiated</b> the Sunningdale Agreement {{and so did}} not reselect the pro Sunningdale MP, John Maginnis.

5000|$|The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s were {{an armed}} protest for {{independence}} from United States Government rule over Puerto Rico. The <b>Party</b> <b>repudiated</b> the [...] "Free Associated State" [...] (Estado Libre Asociado) status that had been enacted in 1950, as the Nationalists considered {{it to be a}} continuation of colonialism.|$|R
50|$|The {{intention}} to repudiate is judged objectively; {{it is not}} a question of whether or not, in the subjective sense, someone thinks he has repudiated the contract. The court will ask how a reasonable person would assess the actions of the alleged <b>repudiating</b> <b>party.</b> The test to be applied is whether or not that party acted in such a way as to lead a reasonable person to the conclusion that he did not intend to fulfill his part of the contract. The breach must be major to constitute repudiation, and the denial must be serious. It must deny a material obligation that goes to the heart of the agreement.|$|R
5000|$|The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s were {{a series}} of coordinated armed protests for the {{independence}} of Puerto Rico led {{by the president of}} the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, Don Pedro Albizu Campos, against the United States Government rule on the Island.

In October 1948 he wrote a letter to The Times which accepted the call by dissident Labour MP Ivor Thomas for a political truce and a government of national unity. When Thomas left the Labour Party over opposition to steel nationalisation, the Accrington Trades and Labour <b>Party</b> <b>repudiated</b> the letter, and Scott-Elliot announced that he would not fight the next election.|$|R

50|$|Anticipatory Breach is an {{important}} aspect of the doctrine of repudiation. Anticipatory Breach occurs where one <b>party</b> <b>repudiates</b> their obligations under the contract prior to the time set to perform obligations. In response, an aggrieved party may, by accepting the repudiation, elect to terminate the contract and claim damages. However, in an instance where an aggrieved party chooses not to accept the repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, the contract will continue on food and the aggrieved party will have no right to damages unless and until an actual breach occurs.|$|R
50|$|After his own <b>party</b> <b>repudiated</b> Muñoz, Marisol Yagüe, {{a former}} secretary, became Marbella's new mayor, but was herself arrested and jailed in March 2006. Deputy Mayor Isabel Garcia Marcos {{was arrested at}} Malaga's airport {{en route to a}} honeymoon in Russia at this time, and police found over €360,000 in cash in a safe in her home. Garcia, a Socialist until her {{expulsion}} from that party in 2003, had been known for criticizing Marbella's endemic corruption. Gil died in 2004, a year after Spain's Supreme Court barred him from holding further public office for 28 years for breach of trust and influence-peddling in the earlier cases, as well as shortly after a lower court ordered him to surrender his Atlético shares and fined him $16 million in connection with the 2002 conviction (but allowed him to remain free on bail during his appeal).|$|R
2500|$|Having {{failed to}} ally with {{capitalist}} countries against fascism in the eves of the World War II, in August 1939 the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which {{would later be}} broken by the Nazis. Many Communists in Western <b>parties</b> <b>repudiated</b> this action and resigned their party membership in protest. American Communists took the public position of being opposed to the war against Germany. The Mine Workers led by Lewis, with a strong pro-Soviet presence, opposed Roosevelt's reelection in 1940 and left the CIO in 1942. [...] After June 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the Communists became fervent supporters {{of the war and}} sought to end wildcat strikes that might hurt war production. [...] The CIO, and in particular the UAW, supported a wartime no-strike pledge that aimed to eliminate not only major strikes for new contracts, but also the innumerable small strikes called by shop stewards and local union leadership to protest particular grievances.|$|R
5000|$|The party's {{relations}} with other groups {{in the black community}} was volatile during this period. At the outset of the Third Period, the rigid communist orthodoxy dictated by the Comintern required the party to attack other, more moderate organizations which also opposed racial discrimination. During the late 1920s, the CPUSA denounced the NAACP and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters as [...] "class enemies" [...] or [...] "class collaborators". Although local leaders worked to modify this hard line in practice, factional infighting and changes dictated from abroad often undid what progress had been made, both in practical work and in {{relations with}} other groups. For example, the national <b>party</b> <b>repudiated</b> much of the work done in Harlem in opposing evictions because the party leader most associated with that work had been expelled, along with Jay Lovestone. The latter had briefly sided with Bukharin in his conflict with Joseph Stalin, an issue that few residents of Harlem cared about.|$|R
50|$|In 1942, {{in order}} to fight Turkey's anti-Armenian politicking, a number of Dashnaks entered into {{negotiations}} with Berlin, and reluctantly {{agreed to participate in}} the formation of a military legion. This was a move, however, that was officially <b>repudiated</b> by ARF <b>party</b> organs.|$|R
5000|$|In 1858, the Democratic Party in Iowa, {{like those}} in other {{northern}} states, was bitterly divided over the support that its own president, James Buchanan, gave for the adoption by Kansas Territory and Congress of the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution. Jones had voted to approve the Lecompton Constitution in the Senate. When anti-slavery Iowa Democrats passed a resolution at their 1858 state convention <b>repudiating</b> the <b>party's</b> previous support for the Lecompton Constitution, Jones {{and others in the}} party's [...] "old guard" [...] walked out.|$|R
50|$|As {{with his}} {{predecessor}} Juan Maria Bordaberry, some observers {{would argue that}} the close links between leading Colorado party figures such as Demicheli and the military mirror the similar elements present in the Colorado party's founder, the 19th century President and military patriot, Fructuoso Rivera. The preference for rule by decree of nineteenth century Colorado President of Uruguay Venancio Flores would also be a historical case in point, according to this argument. Others would reason that Demicheli was morally <b>repudiating</b> Colorado <b>party</b> ideals in cooperating with the civilian-military administration which took office in 1973.|$|R
5000|$|A {{party that}} acts on a genuine but {{erroneous}} {{view of its}} obligations under the contract will not for that reason alone have <b>repudiated</b> it.

50|$|As a {{paid agent}} for the Unionist Party, Craig was the {{election}} agent for James Hutchison in Glasgow Scotstoun in the 1955 general election and for the Unionist parliamentary candidate in Rutherglen in 1964. He twice fought for election to the Glasgow City Corporation in the mid-1960s. His first attempt was in May 1966 when he came forward as an Independent Conservative candidate against the 'Progressive Party', a local alliance between Conservatives and Liberals which controlled the council, in Kelvinside ward. Craig offered to withdraw if the Progressive councillor would <b>repudiate</b> that <b>party's</b> policy on council house rents, and to sit as a Conservative if the party split up; the offer was rejected.|$|R
50|$|A {{peculiarity}} {{of marine}} insurance, and insurance law generally, {{is the use}} of the terms condition and warranty. In English law, a condition typically describes a part of the contract that is fundamental to the performance of that contract, and, if breached, the non-breaching party is entitled not only to claim damages but to terminate the contract on the basis that it has been <b>repudiated</b> by the <b>party</b> in breach.|$|R

40|$|Where a <b>party</b> <b>repudiating</b> a {{contract}} refuses {{to cooperate with}} further performance by the innocent party, is the contract automatically terminated, or is the innocent party merely prevented from earning the agreed sum? The recent decision in Société Générale v Geys has renewed this old controversy. 1 In a forceful dissenting judgment, Lord Sumption argued in favour of automatic termination, relying on Lord Reid’s comments in the famous case of White & Carter v McGregor. 2 The majority of the Supreme Court instead treated cooperation as a practical limit on recovery of the agreed sum. This essay sides against Lord Sumption’s automatic termination approach, but acknowledges that the majority’s view leaves one difficult problem unresolved. The first section of this essay describes the cooperation limitation in outline, starting with the dictum of Lord Reid in White & Carter and considering its application in Geys. The second section assesses and rejects the arguments for regarding cooperation as a limitation on the innocent party’s right to affirm the contract. The third section puts forward the argument that cooperation instead provides a practical limitation on {{the capacity of the}} innocent party to earn the agreed sum, and shows why this means that the limitation is not universally applicable. The final section acknowledges that the approach of the majority in Geys leaves a difficult problem concerning the content of the wage-work bargain in contracts of employment...|$|R

He was removed from command in November after failing to decisively pursue Lee's Army following the tactically inconclusive but strategic Union victory at the Battle of Antietam outside Sharpsburg, Maryland and never received another field command. McClellan {{went on to become}} the unsuccessful Democratic Party nominee in the 1864 presidential election against Lincoln's reelection. The effectiveness of his campaign was damaged when he <b>repudiated</b> his <b>party's</b> platform, which promised an end to the war and negotiations with the southern Confederacy. He served as the 24th Governor of New Jersey from 1878 to 1881. He eventually became a writer, and vigorously defended his Civil War conduct.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A {{contract}} requires two or {{more people}} to come to an agreement with regards to the requirements of such a contract with the intention of following the practice of whatever is set out in the contract, the main intention being to deliver a performance by both parties. When two parties sign a contract they are thus agreeing to stick to the terms of the contract that they are signing, as it becomes effective upon signature. The contract is then rendered to be in place and binding from that moment thereon. This implies that any condition that is not complied with in the contract that might take place after signing the contract will have penalty imputed on the guilty party as per stipulated in the contract. The contract must also provide the detailed measures that will be taken in the case of either party failing to honour the necessary conditions that were stated at the inception of the contract. Failure to adhere to the conditions in the contract is called breaching the terms of the contract and thus the company found guilty of breaching the contract will be liable to pay the penalties agreed to by the parties that have entered into that contract. If a company or individual signs a contract that will provide that particular company or individual with benefits for a certain period, but for whatever reasons the contract gets cancelled, it makes sense that the company or individual should receive compensation for the damages of the loss of the income that it would have received had the contract run its full course as intended without any <b>party</b> <b>repudiating</b> the specific contract in question. This brings me to the concept of damages and compensation...|$|R

During that time he freed Juárez and the other liberals who had been jailed. Upon Comonfort's ouster, Juárez assumed the presidency {{in accordance with the}} constitution, but Zuloaga was in military command of the capital, and Juárez had to establish his government in Guanajuato.

5000|$|Vallandigham {{promoted}} the [...] "peace plank" [...] of the platform, declaring the war a failure and demanding an immediate end of hostilities. In his acceptance letter, George B. McClellan made peace conditional on the Confederacy being ready {{for peace and}} ready to rejoin the Union. McClellan's stance conflicted with the Democratic Party Platform of 1864 which stated that [...] "immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities, {{with a view to}} an ultimate convention of the States, or other peaceable means, to the end that, at the earliest practicable moment, peace may be restored {{on the basis of the}} Federal union of the States." [...] Vallandigham supported his party's nomination of McClellan for the presidency but was [...] "highly indignant" [...] when McClellan <b>repudiated</b> the <b>party</b> platform in his letter of acceptance of the nomination. For a time, Vallandigham withdrew from campaigning for McClellan. Vallandigham was included on the Democratic ticket as Secretary of War. The contradiction between the party platform and McClellan's views weakened Democratic efforts to win voters over.|$|R
