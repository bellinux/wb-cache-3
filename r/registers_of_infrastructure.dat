Over the past two years several working groups (ANFOV) and public partnerships (Mise-Anci 11 / 12 / 2012) have been created with the aim of studying models and guidelines for its realization. Many initiatives are also present at regional level with the same objective (Toscana, Lombardia, Trentino). The solution described in this paper is the first that, by intro- ducing the concept of federation of existing cadastral systems, gives in alternative to the model of a single registry, too difficult to implement and to maintain (Lombardia Region Project). The model of Cadastre proposed is based on the concept of data federation that provide a ”unified view” of all available data, providing a mechanism for automatic collection and stan- dardization of the information coming from the different data base, while ensuring, at all contributors, maximum flexibility in data structure. A further aspect of the peculiar and innovative solution is that it doesnt necessarily required a single point of data storage, but it permits individual systems of origin to continue to be the only holders of the data, solving in a single instance the problem of the consistency of the information and of its maintenance. These elements strongly differ from the ANFOV guide that inspired the solution in object. The proposed solution leads to the definition of the data federation protocol, laying the groundwork for the feasibility and sustainability of the project and the initiative as a whole...|$|R

The system provides a unique solution to centralize and keep actual most common and widely used information {{as a part of}} the eGovernment. The basic registers are the central information source for information systems of public authorities. In October 2014, the Czech government approved the conception of The Strategy for the Development <b>of</b> the <b>Infrastructure</b> for Spatial Information in the Czech Republic to 2020 (GeoInfoStrategy) that serves as a basis for the NSDI. The paper describes the challenges in building the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) in the Czech Republic with focus on the fundamental spatial data and related basic registers. The GeoInfoStrategy should also contribute to increasing of the competitiveness of the economy. Therefore the paper also reflects the Directive 2014 / 61 /EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on measures to reduce the cost of deploying high-speed electronic communication networks. The Directive states that citizens as well as the private and public sectors must have the opportunity to be part of the digital economy.

40|$|The present master's thesis {{deals with}} the {{establishment}} of a data system to be used for the assessment and calculation of depreciation <b>of</b> public service <b>infrastructure</b> for drinking water supply. The aim of collecting the funds for the restoration <b>of</b> the <b>infrastructure</b> network is to maintain the standard of supply and ensure the functional capacity <b>of</b> the <b>infrastructure.</b> The draft system to be used for the assessment and calculation of depreciation <b>of</b> public service <b>infrastructure</b> was designed by integrating the data from the cadastre <b>of</b> public service <b>infrastructure</b> and the existing data from the <b>register</b> <b>of</b> fixed assets. As it has been found during the course of writing the present thesis that the two sets of data are not consistent and that the data from the <b>register</b> <b>of</b> fixed assets do not show the real value <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> or that the calculation of depreciation based on such register does not ensure a sufficient amount for the replacement of decrepit fixed assets, it is proposed that the assessment <b>of</b> public utility <b>infrastructure</b> be based on the data from the cadastre <b>of</b> public service <b>infrastructure,</b> which are presumed to be the most detailed and precise aggregated data on public utility infrastructure. It is proposed in the thesis that the purchase value <b>of</b> new <b>infrastructure</b> be assessed based on the data from the cadastre and the reference pricelist. A realistic assessment of the value of drinking water supply infrastructure facilitates the collection of sufficient depreciation funds and realistic pricing of drinking water supply. This in turn facilitates compliance with the requirements of EU directives (Commission Directive 2006 / 111 /EC on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings as well as on financial transparency within certain undertakings, Directive 2000 / 60 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy) and with the fundamental environmental principles, i. e. the polluterpays principle and the coverage of all costs principle...|$|R

A number of expla-nations of the contradictory findings have been proposed.
