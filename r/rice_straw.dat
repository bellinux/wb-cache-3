Proper understanding of the physical properties of rice residues is necessary for utilizing them in thermochemical conversion processes such as gasification and combustion. The physical properties (moisture content, particle size, bulk density and porosity) of <b>rice</b> husks and <b>straws</b> obtained from three countries (Egypt, Cuba and China) were evaluated in this study. The moisture contents of <b>rice</b> husks and <b>straws</b> were in the ranges of 4. 60 - 6. 07 % and 6. 58 - 6. 92 %, respectively. For all rice varieties tested, the moisture content of the straws was higher than these of the husks. The particle sizes of <b>rice</b> husks and <b>straws</b> were in the ranges of 0. 212 - 0. 850 mm and 0 - 0. 710 mm, respectively. All the rice husk varieties had a normal distribution of particle size around the main value of 0. 6 mm while the particle size distribution for the <b>rice</b> <b>straws</b> showed a decreasing trend, the larger the particle size the higher was the weight percentage. The bulk density of <b>rice</b> husks and <b>straws</b> were in the ranges of 331. 59 - 380. 54 kg m - 3 and 162. 03 - 194. 48 kg m - 3, respectively. The bulk density values of <b>rice</b> <b>straws</b> were lower than those of rice husks. A negative linear relationship between the bulk density and the average particle size was observed for <b>rice</b> husks and <b>straws.</b> The porosity of <b>rice</b> husks and <b>straws</b> were in the ranges of 63. 64 - 68. 94 % and 71. 21 - 85. 28 %, respectively. A positive linear relationship between the porosity and the average particle size was observed for <b>rice</b> husks and <b>straws.</b> Also, a negative linear relationship between the porosity and the bulk density was observed. The results obtained from this study showed significant differences in the physical properties of the <b>rice</b> husks and <b>straws</b> collected from different countries (located in three different continents). These differences may be due to variations in climatic conditions, soil type, methods of cultivation and type of fertilizer used.

Two of 6 cattle were severely affected. But, neurological signs were not found during field observation. Pesticide analysis in <b>rice</b> <b>straws</b> shows that both groups of pesticide, organochlorines (OP) and organophosphates (OP) were detected. Residues of OC were higher than OP as shown as 14. 41 vs 2. 84 ppm (before processing) for OC and 1. 80 vs 0. 0003 ppm (processed) for OP consisting aldrin, lindane, dieldrin, endosulfan and chlorpyrifos methyl. There was only OC detected in sera consisting lindane (0. 6 – 37. 6 ppb); heptachlor (0. 03 – 4. 4 ppb); and aldrin (0. 8 – 20. 4 ppb) with an average total of 21, 4 ppb. The neurological and ophthalmological signs were suspected to be due to organophosphates (OPs) contaminated-rice straws and any other factors such as insufficient vitamin A, magnesium and calcium. Feed replacement with fresh grasses for two cattle reduced corneal changes. Similar symptoms were also reproduced in Wistar rats dosed intraperitoneally with chlorpyriphos methyl. Clinical signs included incoordination, cachexia, eye disorder and corneal opacity. Necropsy showed hepatic injury (hepatic necrosis, mottling of hepatic surface and pale); pale kidneys; swollen of spleen and hyperaemic brain. Microscopic changes were found in brain, liver and eyes.

Now researchers at two Indian universities have developed a technique for producing fermented straw. The straw is spread in a layer 8 - 10 cm thick and sprayed with a solution of 3 - 4 kg of urea in water giving a final moisture level of 50 to 70 %. It is then thoroughly mixed and stacked for one to four weeks before being sun dried for easy storage. Besides enriching the straw with microbial protein the method also improves the nutritive value of the fermented straw. When the preparation is stacked, bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes build up and degrade the urea to release ammonia. This ammonia penetrates the cell walls rendering the fibre more easily accessible than in untreated straw.

30|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} staple food crops, rice produces huge amount of agronomic biomass residues. The handling of biomass is a challenge for breeders, as <b>rice</b> <b>straws</b> decomposition take a long time. Farmers prefer straw burning, which is economic and convenient, but may causes environmental problems. The major reason underlying the difficult treatment procedure is the high cellulose content of the cell wall of straws (Tian et al., 1992). The brittle culm (bc) rice mutants are the ideal breeds for straws treatment owing to lower cellulose content and finer breakage at harvest (Cabiles et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2006). However, not all bc mutants can be used for breeding because of their concomitant phenotypes, such as dwarfism, low fertility and withering of leaf apex (Zhang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2009). Mutations in OsMYB 103 L, a TF regulating SCWs-related genes expression, lead to the decreased cellulose content and brittle culm phenotype without morphological abnormalities (Ye et al., 2015). We have demonstrated that OsSND 2 can regulate MYBs and SCWs CESA genes expression (Figs. 5 f, 6 d and 7 a), and that snd 2 mutants have lower cellulose contents (Fig. 5 e) and exhibit no change in morphology (Fig. 5 d).
