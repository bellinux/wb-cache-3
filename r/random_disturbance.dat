50|$|In {{communication}} systems, {{noise is}} an error or undesired <b>random</b> <b>disturbance</b> of a useful information signal. The noise is a summation of unwanted or disturbing energy from natural and sometimes man-made sources. Noise is, however, typically distinguished from interference, {{for example in}} the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and signal-to-noise plus interference ratio (SNIR) measures. Noise is also typically distinguished from distortion, which is an unwanted systematic alteration of the signal waveform by the communication equipment, for example in the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SINAD) and total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N).|$|E
50|$|The formal {{study of}} the {{information}} content of signals is the field of information theory. The information in a signal is usually accompanied by noise. The term noise usually means an undesirable <b>random</b> <b>disturbance,</b> but is often extended to include unwanted signals conflicting with the desired signal (such as crosstalk). The prevention of noise is covered in part {{under the heading of}} signal integrity. The separation of desired signals from a background is the field of signal recovery, one branch of which is estimation theory, a probabilistic approach to suppressing random disturbances.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of continuous-variable quantum phase {{estimation}} in the presence of linear disturbance at the Hamiltonian level by means of Gaussian probe states. In particular we discuss both unitary and <b>random</b> <b>disturbance</b> by considering the parameter which characterizes the unwanted linear term present in the Hamiltonian as fixed (unitary disturbance) or random with a given probability distribution (<b>random</b> <b>disturbance).</b> We derive the optimal input Gaussian states at fixed energy, maximizing the quantum Fisher information over the squeezing angle and the squeezing energy fraction, and we discuss the scaling of the quantum Fisher information in terms of the output number of photons, nout. We observe that, in the case of unitary disturbance, the optimal state is a squeezed vacuum state and the quadratic scaling is conserved. As regards the <b>random</b> <b>disturbance,</b> we observe that the optimal squeezing fraction may not be equal to one and, for any nonzero value of the noise parameter, the quantum Fisher information scales linearly with the average number of photons.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} traffic demand and limited infrastructure expansion, railway networks are often operated {{close to the}} full capacity, especially in heavily used areas. As a result, the basic timetable is quite susceptible to the operational disturbances, and thereby the propagation and accumulation of delays significantly degrade the service level for customers. To solve this problem, extensive researches have been conducted {{by focusing on the}} predefined robust timetables and the real time dispatching algorithm development. However, it has been widely recognized that excessive robust timetables may deteriorate the operating capacity of the railway network and the addition of recovery time and buffer time can be hardly implemented in the congested area. Moreover, most of the conventional dispatching algorithms ignore the further potential <b>random</b> <b>disturbances</b> during the dispatching process, which yield non-implementable dispatching solutions and, as consequences, inferior punctuality and repetitive dispatching actions. To this end, this project aims to develop a new algorithm for real-world dispatching process with the consideration of risk-oriented <b>random</b> <b>disturbances</b> in dynamic circumstances. In the procedure of this project, an operational risk map will be firstly produced: by simulating considerable amount of disturbed timetables with <b>random</b> <b>disturbances</b> generated in a Monte-Carlo scheme and calculating the corresponding expected negative impacts (average total weighted waiting time among all the disturbances scenarios), different levels of operational risk will be assigned to each block section in the studied railway network. Within a rolling time horizon framework, conflicts are detected with the inclusion of risk-oriented <b>random</b> <b>disturbances</b> in each block section, and the near-optimal dispatching solutions are calculated by using Tabu search algorithm. Finally, three indicators including total weighted waiting time, the number of relative reordering and average absolute retiming, are chosen to testify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed dispatching algorithm. The sensitivity analysis of dispatching-related parameters is conducted afterwards to investigate the most appropriate relevant parameters for the specific studied area. The proposed algorithms are expected to be capable of automatically producing near-optimal and robust dispatching solutions with sufficient punctuality achieved...|$|R
