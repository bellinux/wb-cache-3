40|$|The {{annealing}} behaviour of doses up to 4. 1016 ions/cm 2 implanted at ion currents up to 10 mA is described. Differences between rapid isothermal and furnace annealing in {{the measured}} sheet resistances {{are due to}} different amounts of diffusion and to loss of dopant by evaporation. Implantation at high currents (10 mA) {{does not appear to}} affect the quality of the <b>regrown</b> <b>material</b> provided the temperature rise during implantation is small...|$|E
40|$|Selective-area {{regrowth}} of source/drain was {{studied for}} metal-face AlN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) using molecular beam epitaxy. Heavily doped graded n-type InN/InGaN/GaN was regrown {{to reduce the}} source/drain contact resistance. For the 70 nm <b>regrown</b> <b>material,</b> a sheet resistance of ~ 100 Ω/sq and a contact resistance of ~ 0. 2 Ω. mm were extracted using non-alloyed Ti-based metal contacts. But the ohmic contact resistance and sheet resistance of the HEMTs with regrown source and drain {{were found to be}} yet high using the current processes...|$|E
40|$|Light-emitt ing diodes {{have been}} {{prepared}} by Zn diffusion to form p-n junctions in Te-doped AlxGal-xAs layers grown by liquid phase epitaxy. When the growth process is interrupted by a partial dissolution cycle, the external quantum efficiencies for junctions formed in the material grown after dis-solution are about five times greater than those obtained without a dissolu-tion cycle. Efficiencies of about 1 x 10 - 3 have been measured at about 6750 A for uncoated iodes. Electron microprobe analysis shows that in the <b>regrown</b> <b>material</b> there is a sharp initial drop in A 1 concentration, after which the AI concentration gradient becomes considerably ess than in layers grown without dissolution. In addition the dislocation density in the regrown layers is about a factor of two lower than in material grown without dissolution. Efficient visible light emission has been obtained (1) from AlxGal-xAs p-n junctions grown by the liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) method. It is important to de...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{demonstrate}} {{the applicability of}} MOVPE butt-joint regrowth for integration of all-active InP/AlGaAs/InGaAsP optical components and the realization of high-functionality compact photonic devices. Planar high-quality integration of semiconductor optical amplifiers of various epi-structures with a multi-quantum well electro-absorption modulator has been successfully performed and their optical and crystalline quality was experimentally investigated. The <b>regrown</b> multi-quantum well <b>material</b> exhibits a slight bandgap blue-shift of less than 20 meV, when {{moving away from the}} regrowth interface. In closest vicinity to the mask, the growth profile revealed a bent-up shape which is associated with an increase in the bandgap energy resulting from the combined effect of growth rate suppression and higher Ga concentration. This increase in bandgap energy makes the interface partially transparent (thus beneficial for unaffected light transmission) and forces carriers away from possible interfacial defects. The internal reflectivity below 2. 1 × 10 − 5 ensures minimization of detrimental intracavity feedback...|$|R
40|$|InxGa 1 -xAs {{devices have}} been widely {{researched}} for low power high frequency applications due to the outstanding electron mobility and small bandgap of the <b>materials.</b> <b>Regrown</b> source/drain technology is highly appreciated in InGaAs MOSFET, since {{it is able to}} reduce the thermal budget induced by ion implantation, as well as reduce the source/drain resistance. However, regrown source/drain technology has problems such as high parasitic capacitance and high electric field at gate edge towards the drain side, which will lead to large drain leakage current and compromise the frequency performance. To alleviate the drain leakage current problem for low power applications and to improve the high frequency performance, a novel Si 3 N 4 sidewall structure was introduced to the InGaAs MOSFET. Device simulation was carried out with different newly proposed sidewall designs. The results showed that both the drain leakage current and the source/drain parasitic capacitance were reduced by applying Si 3 N 4 sidewall together with InP extended layer in InGaAs MOSFET. The simulation results also suggested that the newly created “recessed” sidewall was able to bring about the most frequency favorable characteristic with no current sacrifice...|$|R
