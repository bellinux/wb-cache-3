40|$|ABSTRACTIn Ro-Ro {{terminal}}s, terminal {{capacity is}} more needed than {{other types of}} marine terminals since <b>Ro-Ro</b> <b>cargoes</b> cannot be stacked. In this sense, the variables affecting capacity of a Ro-Ro terminal can be listed as follows; number of vehicles arrived to a terminal, distance between terminals, ship capacity, terminal gates, customs control units, terminal traffic and local traffic, security check, bunkering services etc. In this study, a model generated intended for making capacity analysis in Ro-Ro terminals by using simulation modeling method. Effect of three variables to terminal capacity was investigated while generating the scenarios; ‘number of trucks arriving to terminals’, ‘distance between terminals’ and ‘Ro-Ro ship capacity’. The {{results show that the}} variable which affect terminal capacity mostly is ‘number of trucks arriving to terminals’. As a consequence of this situation, it is thought that a Ro-Ro terminal operator must prioritize the demand factor and make an effective demand forecasting in determination of the terminal area...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of Motorways of the Sea (MoS) services offered at Italian ports from 2008 to 2015 is analyzed. In particular, a detailed research on MoS routes calling at Italian ports, in the year 2015 is carried out; within MoS routes: ro-pax and only <b>cargo</b> <b>ro-ro</b> services are identified. MoS routes in the year 2015 are compared {{with those in the}} years: 2008, 2010 and 2012. The study highlights two main aspects. Firstly, the great majority of MoS routes in Italy are ro-pax ones: ro-ro routes are only 31 % of the total, but ro-pax service frequencies are highly variable during the year, from high to low season. Secondly, due to the economic crisis, carriers are trying to operate services with high load factors and trying to find new markets: in fact from 2008 to 2015 routes frequencies have decreased, while the number of port calls in each route has increased. Finally, the capability of ro-ro and ro-pax routes of being competitive versus all-road transport has been analyzed. The analysis has shown that both ro-ro and ro-pax routes show relevant problems as far as their competitiveness against all-road transport is concerned. Ro-pax routes are not reliable, ro-ro routes are not fast and frequent: consequently they both do not fulfill essential requirements for MoS services...|$|R
40|$|High and heavy’ cargo {{units are}} carried {{around the world}} on roll-on-roll-off (<b>ro-ro)</b> ships. These <b>cargo</b> units are loaded and {{unloaded}} using rolltrailers and the risk of rollover for the trailer-cargo unit, during port manoeuvre, often needs to be assessed in short time. On request by Wallenius Marine AB in Stockholm, this thesis examines the dynamics of the rolltrailer and different methods to predict the risk of rollover. The objective is to present a theoretical foundation for a toolbox that can support the assessment of trailer-load combinations. The study focuses on the effect of running over ‘bumps’. An analytic model, based on assumptions of the transfer of energy in the rollover scenario, as well as a simulation, within the SimMechanics environment, was developed and the two were compared. The models produced almost identical output under the circumstances specified. The conclusion was that the assumptions made in the analytic model were reasonable and that the model can be used to characterize the trailer-cargo unit’s stability. The major reservation was that some dynamic properties of the trailer had been neglected and that the model does not account for a sequence of inputs and resonance effects. The recommendation given is to develop the analytic model to an application for practical use. A developed SimMechanics simulation, on the other hand, can be used to examine additional dynamic aspects, resonance effects and other types of influences. Such results could support the decision making regarding what safety margin should be applied to the analytic result...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} few years, the {{discussion}} on the marginal social costs of transportation has been active. Applying the externalities {{as a tool to}} control transport would fulfil the polluter pays principle and simultaneously create a fair control method between the transport modes. This report presents the results of two calculation algorithms developed to estimate the marginal social costs based on the externalities of air pollution. The first algorithm calculates the future scenarios of sea transport traffic externalities until 2015 in the Gulf of Finland. The second algorithm calculates the externalities of Russian passenger car transit traffic via Finland by taking into account both sea and road transport. The algorithm estimates the ship-originated emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrogen oxides (NO x), sulphur oxides (SO x), particulates (PM) and the externalities for each year from 2007 to 2015. The total NOx emissions in the Gulf of Finland from the six ship types were almost 75. 7 kilotons (Table 5. 2) in 2007. The ship types are: passenger (including cruisers and ROPAX vessels), tanker, general <b>cargo,</b> <b>Ro-Ro,</b> container and bulk vessels. Due to the increase of traffic, the estimation for NO x emissions for 2015 is 112 kilotons. The NO x emission estimation for the whole Baltic Sea shipping is 370 kilotons in 2006 (Stipa & al, 2007). The total marginal social costs due to ship-originated CO 2, NO x, SO x and PM emissions in the GOF were calculated to almost 175 million Euros in 2007. The costs will increase to nearly 214 million Euros in 2015 due to the traffic growth. The major part of the externalities is due to CO 2 emissions. If we neglect the CO 2 emissions by extracting the CO 2 externalities from the results, we get the total externalities of 57 million Euros in 2007. After eight years (2015), the externalities would be 28 % lower, 41 million Euros (Table 8. 1). This {{is the result of the}} sulphur emissions reducing regulation of marine fuels. The majority of the new car transit goes through Finland to Russia due to the lack of port capacity in Russia. The amount of cars was 339 620 vehicles (Statistics of Finnish Customs 2008) in 2005. The externalities are calculated for the transportation of passenger vehicles as follows: by ship to a Finnish port and, after that, by trucks to the Russian border checkpoint. The externalities are between 2 – 3 million Euros (year 2000 cost level) for each route. The ports included in the calculations are Hamina, Hanko, Kotka and Turku. With the Euro- 3 standard trucks, the port of Hanko would be the best choice to transport the vehicles. This is because of lower emissions by new trucks and the saved transport distance of a ship. If the trucks are more polluting Euro 1 level trucks, the port of Kotka would be the best choice. This indicates that the truck emissions have a considerable effect on the externalities and that the transportation of light cargo, such as passenger cars by ship, produces considerably high emission externalities. The emission externalities approach offers a new insight for valuing the multiple traffic modes. However, the calculation of the marginal social costs based on the air emission externalities should not be regarded as a ready-made calculation system. The system is clearly in the need of some improvement but it can already be considered as a potential tool for political decision making...|$|R

Their behaviour when analysing the exploitation costs is very similar to Ro-Ro vessel’s, and it cannot be forgotten that nowadays most of the Ro-Ro vessels carry passengers as well. The empirical data used to formulate this paper are based on the Spanish market and the current Mediterranean lines. The aim of this paper is to find an expression for the total costs depending on the parameters of the analyzed route, bearing in mind that the vessel’s capacity will be an important factor. This model will be applied to rolled cargo vessels, especially trucks or platforms. Once the costs function is obtained the long run marginal costs will also be obtained, depending on the line capacity, aiming to obtain the optimum pricing, according to microeconomic theory. Frequency and regularity reflected upon the amount of scales will also be considered to be important because the long run marginal costs will depend on the amount of scales and the amount of transported platforms/trucks.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{structural}} design {{work of an}} innovative trimaran ship for the transport of <b>ro-ro</b> <b>cargo</b> is presented. The project {{was carried out in}} cooperation with a private Company, the Department of Naval Architecture of the University of Genova and MARIN Institute. The vessel consists of a central displacement hull with a wave-piercing bow, and two outriggers connected to the main hull by wing arms. The particular shape of the main hull with its wavepiercing bow, aims to give lower hydrodynamic resistance and minimal pitching motion. In waves this results in low occurrence of hull slamming and whipping shock. The two symmetric outriggers produce a positive hydrodynamic interaction with the main hull leading to a reduction in resistance, and guarantee transverse stability avoiding rhythmic rolling settling. For the structural design of the trimaran a longitudinally and transversally framed hull structure in high tensile steel was chosen for main hull, outriggers, wing arms and superstructures. This allowed to obtain very high strength together with minimum weight. In this paper a first general description of the structural design is presented highlighting the most important structural characteristics of the vessel; then the complete FEM model analysis of the vessel performed with MAESTRO software is presented, with the description of the global dynamic loads used for the FEM analysis.

In the first phase four terminals are projected on the northern side of the bay. (See appendix II for {{a map of the}} project site.) One of these terminals will be a multi-purpose terminal for the handling of bagged rice and bagged foodgrain, iron scrap and other general cargo as well as containerized and <b>ro-ro</b> <b>cargo.</b> The cargo will in the first phase be handled by ships gear, supported by one heavy mobile crane and in the second phase t w o additional rail mounted gantry cranes will be installed on the quay. The terminal is projected as a reclaimed island with a solid gravity type berth, connected with the mainland by an approach road. Open and covered storage will be provided directly behind the apron. Warehousing will take place on the mainland. The length of the quay will be 275 m for two berths. The projected cargo volume will be 290, 000 tons in the first phase and 1, 1 20, 000 tons in the second. The second terminal will be a so called common user bulk terminal for the handling of oil cakes, salt, fertilizer and fertilizer raw materials and coal. The loading will be done by one shiploader with an effective loading capacity of some 750 - 1000 ton/h. Unloading will be done with a grab unloader of 700 - 900 ton/h capacity discharging directly on a belt conveyer. Open and covered storage will be provided directly behind the apron in the form of wind row arrangement and storage sheds. The terminal is located directly westward of the multi-purpose terminal. It shares the same approach road. The inland transport of both terminals will be with trucks which can discharge and load on the reclamation. The length of the quay is 425 m hosting two berths. The projected cargo volume will be 2. 4 million tons in the first phase and 4. 1 million tons in the second. The third terminal will be a dedicated cement terminal of 185 m. The terminal will be situated southwest of the common user bulk terminal and constructed as a piled jetty connected to the mainland by a partially piled, partially earth dam approach road. The fourth terminal will be a dedicated copper smelter terminal for the import of dry bulk and the export of liquid bulk. The terminal will be connected to the cement terminal on the southwest side, sharing the same approach road.
