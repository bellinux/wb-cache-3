5|$|Development {{work on the}} CFM56 began before CFMI was {{formally}} created. While work proceeded smoothly, the international arrangement led to unique working conditions. For example, both companies had assembly lines, some engines were assembled and tested in the U.S. and others in France. Engines assembled in France were subject to the initially strict export agreement, which meant that GE's core {{was built in the}} U.S., then shipped to the SNECMA plant in France where it was placed in a locked <b>room</b> <b>into</b> which even the President of SNECMA was not allowed. The SNECMA components (the fore and aft sections of the engine) were brought into the room, GE employees mounted them to the core, and then the assembled engine was taken out to be finished.|$|E
5|$|Overhauling {{the team}} {{during his first}} year at Liverpool, Shankly {{released}} 24 players and converted a boot storage <b>room</b> <b>into</b> a meeting place where he and his coaches discussed strategy. They won the 1961–62 Second Division title and were promoted to the First Division. Two seasons later, Liverpool won their first League title since 1946–47, thereby qualifying for Liverpool's first participation in UEFA competition. The following season, Liverpool won their first FA Cup. Further League titles followed in 1965–66 and 1972–73. 1973 brought their first European trophy, the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. The following season, Shankly's last, they won the FA Cup again.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} sometime between the Dissolution and the Union of the Crowns but the exact date is not known. It was probably constructed {{as a strong}} room to store munitions or provide a secure location if the city walls were breached. This turned the ground floor <b>room</b> <b>into</b> a lock up where troublesome citizens would be thrown until they came before the law to be punished. Much about the tower has changed. The wall {{to the right of}} the door is 13th-century, while the dividing wall including the door is 18th-century.|$|E

5000|$|Stephen Fry {{attempted}} to put <b>Room</b> 101 <b>into</b> <b>Room</b> 101 (mainly {{because it was}} about people talking about things they hate). Merton {{found it hard to}} decide what to do because if he did put <b>Room</b> 101 <b>into</b> <b>Room</b> 101, he said, it would be like committing [...] "professional suicide", and if he didn't put it <b>into</b> <b>Room</b> 101, he would have to give it to Stephen and it would then become his. Merton did put it <b>into</b> the <b>room,</b> which made the picture go blank followed by Merton saying [...] "I wish I hadn't done that". In the run up to <b>Room</b> 101 going <b>into</b> <b>Room</b> 101, Room Lovely involved Stephen nominating things he liked, such as Kathy Burke and public libraries.|$|R

5|$|Helen {{went away}} for a period in June 1941, during which Parsons, {{encouraged}} {{to do so by}} the sexually permissive attitude of the O.T.O., began a sexual relationship with her 17-year-old sister, Sara. Upon Helen's return, Sara asserted that she was Parsons' new wife, and Parsons himself admitted that he found Sara more sexually attractive than Helen. Conflicted in her feelings, Helen sought comfort in Smith and began a relationship with him that lasted {{for the rest of his}} life; the four remained friends. The two couples, along with a number of other Thelemites (some of whom with their children), moved to 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, an American Craftsman-style mansion. They all contributed to the rent of $100 a month and lived communally in what replaced Winona Boulevard as the new base of the Agape Lodge, maintaining an allotment and slaughtering their own livestock for meat as well as blood rituals. Parsons decorated his new room with a copy of the Stele of Revealing, a statue of Pan, and his collection of swords and daggers. He converted the garage and laundry <b>room</b> <b>into</b> a chemical laboratory and often held science fiction discussion meetings in the kitchen, and entertained the children with hunts for fairies in the 25-acre garden.|$|E
5|$|Lady Crane {{returns to}} her {{chambers}} to find a wounded Arya Stark hiding inside, and helps stitch her wounds. She tells Arya that thanks to her warning, she mutilated her would-be killer Bianca's face before kicking {{her out of the}} acting company. She then offers to have Arya join them, but she refuses, saying that she intends to travel west of Westeros to see the edge of the world. As Arya recovers, The Waif arrives and kills Lady Crane, intending to kill Arya as well. Arya flees through the streets of Braavos, but during the chase, Arya's wounds reopen and she limps back to her hideout with the Waif in close pursuit. As the Waif closes in, Arya uses Needle to cut a candle, plunging the <b>room</b> <b>into</b> total darkness, where, having been trained while blinded for several weeks, Arya gains the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|To {{convert the}} {{backlink}} data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into {{a measure of}} importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized {{that it could be}} used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web page to another, and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page. Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network. After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm <b>room</b> <b>into</b> an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, Ng {{launched}} Zouk Kuala Lumpur, {{the sister}} club to Zouk Singapore. However, the initial years {{were met with}} many obstacles, and Zouk KL underwent a major revamp in 2008, dividing its existing <b>rooms</b> <b>into</b> 7 <b>rooms</b> catering to the growing demographic.|$|R
5|$|The 1828 {{construction}} {{features a}} central hall with three {{rooms on the}} east and west sides of roughly symmetrical construction with chimneys at the intersection of the front and middle rooms. The first floor chimneys were flanked by doors allowing access to the other rooms and storage on the other side. The layout and usage of the jail is not known for certain, but it is believed that the rooms to the west were used by the jailer and his family. The first room as a parlor, the middle as the dining room and the rear room as the kitchen. As part of the renovations in 1959, the Society changed the parlor to a research room, the dining <b>room</b> <b>into</b> a library and added a door to the stairway from the kitchen. The front research room and library retain the original fireplaces, pine floorboards and closets, but the connecting passage between the two rooms were changed to a bathroom. The east side of the jail {{is believed to have been}} used by the jailer for his occupational duties, with the front room as a public reception room and the middle room as his office. The rear room in the back may have been used for record or other storage. After leasing the property, the Society removed the partitions in the rooms that separated the rooms from each other.|$|E

Most places {{associated}} with Guruji’s college years are located close to Yukteswarji’s Ashram {{which was at}} Rai Ghat lane (Buro Bibi Lane). On {{the site of the}} old Ashram, stands a Smriti Mandir. Nearby is the house of Guruji’s uncle, Sarada Prasad Ghosh, where he stayed for some time. Guruji’s cousin, Prabhas Chandra Gosh, has converted Guruji’s <b>room</b> <b>into</b> a shrine and named it Anandaloka.|$|E

25|$|Enclosing a fire also {{prevents}} {{air from}} being sucked from the <b>room</b> <b>into</b> the chimney. This can represent a significant loss of heat as an open fireplace can pull away many cubic metres of heated air per hour. Efficiency is {{generally regarded as}} the maximum heat output of a stove or fire, and is usually referred to by manufacturers as the difference between heat to the room and heat lost up the chimney.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the doorway}} is wide enough, many Ashkenazi Jews tilt the mezuzah {{so that the}} top slants toward the <b>room</b> <b>into</b> which the door opens. This is done to {{accommodate}} the variant opinions of Rashi and of his grandson, Rabbeinu Tam, {{as to whether it}} should be placed vertically (Rashi) or horizontally (Rabbeinu Tam), and also to imply that God and the Torah (which the mezuzah symbolizes) are entering the room. The compromise solution has been suggested by Rabbi Jacob ben Asher.|$|E
25|$|Surrounded by a picket fence, the Mapleton Drive {{house is}} two stories with a first floor kitchen, dining room, {{living room and}} {{adjoining}} patio, and at least three bedrooms on the second floor—one for the boys, one for the parents, and a guest <b>room</b> <b>into</b> which Beaver moves for a night. The cellar is accessible through a diagonal door in the kitchen. A kitchen door opens onto a small side yard, the driveway, and a single-car garage—a frequent setting for get-togethers between the boys, their father, and the boys' friends.|$|E
50|$|The Moat Club {{was formed}} in the 1950s with the {{intention}} of providing the Naas area with facilities to be used for dramatic theater and table tennis. In 1960 it bought the Christian Brothers school and converted the upper <b>rooms</b> <b>into</b> a hall for table tennis. The lower <b>rooms</b> were converted <b>into</b> a 125-seat theatre in 1963, and called the Moat Theatre. It was renovated in the early 2000s, re-opening in 2003.|$|R

25|$|Sala Azul (Blue Room), {{which is}} not {{actually}} blue, is covered in white and gold silk walls and drapery, with matching chairs and cushioned sofa over a parquet floor. Between 1863 and 1865, it was remodelled by Possidónio da Silva {{in order to provide}} a Royal sitting room in the tastes of Queen Maria Pia. Avant-garde for its time it included visual effects that proportioned the space, including two grand mirrors on opposite walls (one over the fireplace and the other between two windows) and a Romanesque arch opening that extends the gaze of the Blue <b>Room</b> <b>into</b> the neighbouring Gabinete de Carvalho annex.|$|E
25|$|The four terrorists stormed {{into the}} ship's dining room. They shot their {{automatic}} weapons {{over the heads}} of the eating passengers. Screams from the passengers meshed with the shouting of the gunmen and with the sound of falling glass shards and splinters. Viola Meskin tried to run to a door but was intercepted by a terrorist with a gun who turned her back. Austrian passenger Anna Hoeranter ran to an exit but was pushed down an adjacent flight of stairs by one of the terrorists. Other passengers ran in a panic from the dining <b>room</b> <b>into</b> the kitchen and were chased by one of the terrorists. Inside the kitchen the pursuing terrorist beat two of the kitchen staff to the floor.|$|E
25|$|Changes at Belcourt {{have been}} {{numerous}} {{in the years following}} 1956 when the Tinney Family moved in. They raised the ceiling of the Organ Loft 11 feet (3.4 m) to accommodate a 26-rank tracker organ. Between 1966 and 1970, when the coronation coach was being built, an old kitchen area became a coach hall. In 1969, the open loggia became a French salon. In 1975, they transformed the north-west reception <b>room</b> <b>into</b> a chapel with the addition of German renaissance stained glass. In the early 1980s, the Tinneys built gate piers on Bellevue Avenue and installed gates that they had acquired from the Taylor estate in Portsmouth. The overthrow was altered to make the gates the tallest of any estate entrance in Newport.|$|E

25|$|The two {{walked out}} of the library at 11:36a.m., ending the hostage {{situation}} there. Cautiously, fearing the shooters' return, 34 uninjured and 10 injured survivors began to evacuate the library through the north door, which led to the sidewalk adjacent to the west entrance. Kacey Ruegsegger was evacuated from the library by Craig Scott. Had she not been evacuated at this point, Ruegsegger would likely have bled to death from her injuries. Patrick Ireland, unconscious, and Lisa Kreutz, unable to move, remained in the building. Patti Nielson joined Brian Anderson and the three library staff in the exterior break <b>room,</b> <b>into</b> which Klebold had earlier fired shots. They locked themselves in and remained there until they were freed, at approximately 3:30p.m.|$|E
25|$|Roches {{threatened}} to sue Dún Laoghaire Corporation for £1.3 million pounds, a large amount at the time, despite legal opinion that such a claim could never be substantiated. However, {{they said that they}} would withdraw this claim if they were allowed to knock down the wings. Dún Laoghaire Corporation submitted a proposal for opinion that they could demolish the wings and integrate the Pillar <b>room</b> <b>into</b> the part that was to be retained. This was rejected by the conservationists. Several groups in favour of conservation including An Taisce, Bord Fáilte, the National Monuments Advisory Council, the Old Dublin Society, the Arts Council, and the Irish Georgian Society, signed a formal objection rejecting any proposition on the part of Dún Laoghaire Corporation to permit the demolition of any part of Frescati. Several companies offered to buy the house and promised to develop the lands while preserving Frescati. One of these companies wanted to erect a residential development in the remaining land which integrated a restored Frescati. All of these offers were refused.|$|E

Wendy tells Ron (Nick Offerman) she knows Ron learned her {{marriage}} to Tom was a [...] "green card marriage" [...] to keep her from being deported to Canada, and thanks him for his discretion. She tells him they will soon be able to divorce without raising any suspicions, unaware that Tom is visibly upset about it.|$|E
