40|$|Relative price {{changes in}} Japanese and U.

In sectors where productivity growth is high, reductions in costs can neutralize exchange rate appreciations to keep prices competitive with those abroad, {{at least in the}} long run, But even in these sectors, exchange rate fluctuations are the dominant influence on relative competitiveness in the short run. Faced with swings in exchange rates, firms adopt defensive measures to defend <b>their</b> <b>export</b> markets. The paper presents estimates of "pricing to market" elasticities which suggest that firms lower <b>their</b> <b>export</b> prices in domestic currency relative to their domestic prices in order to limit the effects of currency appreciations.

40|$|I {{propose a}} model of {{international}} trade with liquidity constraints. If firms must pay a fixed entry cost in order to access foreign markets, and if they face liquidity constraints to finance these costs, only those firms that have sufficient liquidity are able to export. A set of firms could profitably export, but are prevented from doing so because they lack sufficient liquidity. More productive firms that generate large liquidity from their domestic sales, and wealthier firms that inherit {{a large amount of}} liquidity, are more likely to export. This model offers a potential explanation for the apparent lack of sensitivity of exports to exchange rate fluctuations. When the exchange rate appreciates, existing exporters lose competitiveness abroad, and are forced to <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> <b>exports.</b> At the same time, the value of domestic assets owned by potential exporters increases. Some liquidity constrained exporters start exporting. This dampens the anti-competitiveness impact of a currency appreciation. Under some conditions, it may reverse it altogether and increase aggregate exports. In this sense, the model is able to rationalize the co-existence of competitive devaluations and competitive revaluations...|$|R

Then, we show that countries enter more unrelated products when they are at an intermediate level of economic development, and when they have higher levels of human capital. Finally, we ask whether countries entering more unrelated products grow faster than those entering only related products. The data shows that countries that enter more unrelated activities experience an increase in short-term economic growth of 0. 5 % per annum compared to those with similar levels of income, human capital, capital stock per worker, and economic complexity.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{exchange}} rate volatility on trade in 39 selected Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries for the period 1995 - 2012. Export and import models were estimated using panel data econometric technique. Three measures of volatility are used. These are standard deviation, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity and Hodrick-Prescott (HP) -Filter. The {{results suggest that the}} effect of exchange rate volatility on trade is dependent of the type of volatility measure used. This reflects the importance of not solely relying on a unique measure of volatility. The results revealed that exchange rate volatility (measured with standard deviation and HP filter) depresses exports, suggesting that SSA exporters are susceptible to <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> <b>export</b> activities when exchange rates become volatile. However, the fact that the degree of the impact of exchange rate volatility on trade is relatively weak, suggest that should SSA’s policy makers decide to pursue a policy intended to reduce exchange rate volatility in order to boost trade, it might be of little or no value. The results also indicate that exchange rate volatility is associated with a reduction in imports...|$|R

The sequence of protein interactions underlying the export pathway are poorly characterized; in particular, {{it is not known}} how chaperoned substrates in the cytosol are engaged <b>by</b> the membrane-localized <b>export</b> apparatus. We have identified a stalled intermediate export complex in the flagellar type III export pathway of Salmonella typhimurium by generating dominant-negative chaperone variants that are export-defective and arrest flagellar assembly in the wild-type bacterium. These chaperone variants bound <b>their</b> specific <b>export</b> substrates strongly and severely <b>reduced</b> <b>their</b> <b>export.</b> They also attenuated export of other flagellar proteins, indicating that inhibition occurs at a common step in the pathway.

After expression of the variant chaperones in Salmonella, a stalled intermediate export complex, which contained chaperone, substrate, and the FliI ATPase with its regulator FliH, was isolated. Neither chaperone nor substrate alone was able to interact with liposome-associated FliI, but the chaperone-substrate-FliI(FliH) complex was assembled when chaperone was prebound to its substrate.

40|$|In some industrialized {{countries}} there are trends towards {{a reduction in}} foreign aid. Although such cuts will undoubtedly retard economic growth and social development in developing countries, donor governments inevitably evaluate their foreign aid programmes not only as altruistic activities, but also as political and economic investments. One reason for the decline in assistance to agriculture has been the opposition of farm pressure groups in donor countries. Many of these groups believed that agricultural assistance to developing countries would <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> <b>export</b> opportunities. Foreign assistance to agriculture: a win-win proposition looks more closely at this assertion and shows that, contrary to expectation, agricultural assistance {{in the form of}} agricultural research expands developing-country imports from the world market. This occurs because agricultural research does more than increase agricultural production: the rise in agricultural production boosts incomes within and outside agriculture, and this increases demand for other goods and services. Assistance to agriculture therefore, provides opportunities for exports from donor countries to expand, not decline.

Exporters, particularly when entering new markets, {{have to learn}} about market conditions and to search for new trade relations under uncertainty. In that sense the paper also investigates the role of economic diplomacy and knowledge spillovers from colleague-exporters. We combine detailed international trade data by firm and destination between 2002 and 2008 with firm data and export market characteristics in order to disentangle the firm and country determinants of successful and less successful export behaviour. First, we find that about 5 % of all Dutch exporters have just started in their first market and a similar share of exporters ceases all exports. Still, the starting exporters increase <b>their</b> <b>exports</b> very fast. In each market <b>their</b> <b>export</b> growth in <b>their</b> third year as exporter is about {{twice as high as}} for established exporters. Many starters also increase <b>their</b> <b>exports</b> <b>by</b> expanding <b>their</b> number of destinations, but they will retreat swiftly if they are not successful. For all exporters we find that more productive and larger firms are more inclined to enter (additional) export markets, and that larger firms are less likely to leave a market. Market characteristics are important as well. Distance and import tariffs reduce the probability to enter the market and increase the probability to exit. Not only distance to the home country matters, but also the distance to export markets already accessed. Firms seem to follow a stepping stone approach for reaching markets further away (physically and culturally). They first enter more nearby markets before moving to more distant markets. Finally, we find that the presence of support offices abroad and trade missions in destination countries, particularly middle income countries, stimulate the entry of new exporters and the growth of export volume. Knowledge spillovers from exporters with the same destinations have also positive effects on market entry...|$|R
