50|$|Spin casting, {{also known}} as {{centrifugal}} <b>rubber</b> <b>mold</b> casting (CRMC), is a method of utilizing centrifugal force to produce castings from a <b>rubber</b> <b>mold.</b> Typically, a disc-shaped mold is spun along its central axis at a set speed. The casting material, usually molten metal or liquid thermoset plastic, is then poured in through an opening at the top-center of the mold. The filled mold then continues to spin as the metal solidifies or the thermoset plastic sets.|$|R

The introduction of silicone rubbers was a breakthrough in the traditional natural <b>rubber</b> <b>molding</b> technique, improving mold life cycle and, most of all, providing the opportunity to choose different material properties {{as a consequence of the}} pattern geometry. In this study, different silicone rubbers with modified thermal behavior (and more specifically thermal conductivity) were produced and developed.

40|$|Purpose: Conventional {{investment}} casting of turbine blades {{is a time}} consuming and expensive process due to the complications in wax injection steps and the complex shape of airfoil surfaces. By using rapid {{investment casting}}, a substantial improvement in the gas turbine blade manufacturing process can be expected. However, this process {{needs to be able}} to compete with conventional investment casting from a dimensional accuracy view of point. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the manufacture of gas turbine blades via two indirect rapid tooling (RT) technologies, namely epoxy (EP) resin tooling and silicon <b>rubber</b> <b>molding.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The second stage blade of a Ruston TA 1750 gas turbine (rated at 1. 3 MW) was digitized by a coordinate measuring machine. The aluminum-filled EP resin and silicon rubber molds were fabricated using StereoLithography master models. Several wax patterns were made by injection in the EP resin and silicone rubber molds. These wax patterns were utilized for ceramic shell fabrication and blade casting. Findings: Dimensional inspection of cast blades showed that silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>molding</b> was not a suitable approach for production of blade wax patterns. The maximum deviation for the final cast blade made using the silicone rubber mold was þ 0. 402 mm. The maximum deviation for the final cast blade made using the EP resin mold was lower at 20. 282 mm. This showed that EP resin tooling could enable new cost-effective solutions for small batch production of gas turbine blades. Practical implications: The research results presented will give efficient industrial approach and scientific insight of the gas turbine blade manufacturing by use of rapid technologies. Originality/value: There are some general research works related to utilization of rapid technologies for manufacturing of gas turbine blade. However, this paper presents a unique procedure of integrated reverse engineering and RT technologies for rapid investment casting of gas turbine blade through presenting comprehensive comparison between two techniques from dimensional accuracy view of point...|$|E

40|$|Assembly {{operations}} that involve flexible parts differ greatly from rigid-part assembly {{due to the}} capacity of the parts to comply with motions of the manipulators by yielding to the contact forces. This natural compliance can be exploited in the design of tasks involving the manipulation of flexible loads. Namely, using knowledge about the force vector field generated by conservative restoring forces of the load, a trajectory for the manipulator end-effector can be specified. The idea is illustrated through two case studies: an analysis of the problem of bending a flexible sheet, and experiments on an insertion task where a flexible beam has to be inserted in a hole with friction in the direction of insertion. 1 Introduction Robotic manipulation of flexible loads has only recently become part of the robotics literature, despite {{the fact that there are}} many industrial tasks that involve the assembly of flexible parts.

40|$|Fossilized {{remains of}} an unknown species of cyprinidontiformes (top minnows/pupfish) fish were {{recovered}} {{on the grounds of}} the Nevada Test Site (area of which is currently closed off to the public). The specimens were found in Miocene volcaniclastic lake sediments and range in size up to 10 cm. The original bone material of most specimens was missing, leaving highfidelity natural molds in hard silicified silt. Silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>molding</b> compound was used to reproduce the original appearance of the bones. Images of these rubber casts were made with a high-resolution, flat-bed scanner and with a scanning electron microscope. From these images it is possible to compare the skeletal structure of these fish to modern fish, and to other Miocene fish fossils. While the species has not yet been determined, it appears that only one species is represented, suggesting a stressed environment in these volcanic lakes. The highresolution casts also show growth lines on the scales and ostracods in the gut, giving a clue to the food web of the original community. This study gives us a window into the late Cenozoic era, and the environment of the fish. Like their ancient counterparts, modern topminnows live in extreme habitats. Finding how these fish met their end could give us insight into how we might protect similar, threatened, species today. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Tactile sensors are {{currently}} being designed to sense interactions with human hands or pen-like interfaces. They are generally embedded in screens, keyboards, mousepads, and pushbuttons. However, they are not well fitted to sense interactions {{with all kinds of}} objects. A novel sensor was originally designed to investigate robotics manipulation where not only the contact with an object needs to be detected, but also where the object needs to be held and manipulated. This tactile sensor has been designed with features that allow it to sense a large variety of objects in human environments. The sensor is capable of detecting forces coming from any direction. As a result, this sensor delivers a force vector with three components. In contrast to most of the tactile sensors that are flat, this one sticks out from the surface so that it is likely to come in contact with objects. The sensor conforms to the object with which it interacts. This augments the contact's surface, consequently reducing the stress applied to the object. This feature makes the sensor ideal for grabbing objects and other applications that require compliance with objects. The operational range of the sensor allows it to operate well with objects found in peoples' daily life. The fabrication of this sensor is simple and inexpensive because of its compact mechanical configuration and reduced electronics. These features are convenient for mass production of individual sensors as well as dense arrays. The biologically inspired tactile sensor is sensitive to both normal and lateral forces, providing better feedback to the host robot about the object to be grabbed. It has a high sensitivity, enabling its use in manipulation fingers, which typically have low mechanical impedance in order to be very compliant. The construction of the sensor is simple, using inexpensive technologies like silicon <b>rubber</b> <b>molding</b> and standard stock electronics...|$|E
