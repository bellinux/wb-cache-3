40|$|In today’s world, energy {{generation}} and delivery systems {{based on the}} conventional utility and renewable sources are transitioning into a new digitalized smart grid model. An earlier work was focused on PV solar satellite for V-I characteristics, and Cloud Energy Metering System (CEMS) for the initial phase of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) system. It was designed to communicate with a cloud DataCenter via any RF medium (Access points, Wi-Max, GSM base station, RF, etc). However, we observed that existing metering infrastructure lacks RF integration for wireless data transfers. Consequently, {{in the era of}} Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), an introduction of RF in the CEMS would be considered novel since it can report energy usage over digital communication interfaces. This paper proposes a green/renewable power generation AMI system (CEMS) showing the conceptual <b>RF</b> <b>meter</b> communication with the Enterprise Energy Tracking Analytics Cloud portal (EETACP). We outlined the design formulations, the mathematical models as well as the CEMS algorithm used to manipulate energy usage data. We validated our design with simulation model using Protus ISIS Version 7. 6 software package. The Cloud meter integration with the provider card recharge service unit and the consumer load viability tests were shown to produce satisfactory results. Through the design specification process, this paper demonstrates that data transmission from RF transceivers into the cloud for user energy consumption access is possible thereby re-engineering the current AMI devices for smart gri...|$|E

Quantitative pits are considered less biased than coring methods but are invasive and often cost-prohibitive. We compared fixed-depth and mass-based estimates of SOC stocks (0. 3 -meters depth) for hammer, hydraulic push, and rotary coring methods relative to quantitative pits at four agricultural sites ranging in RF content {{from less than}} 0. 01 to 0. 24 cubic meters per cubic meter. Sampling costs were also compared. Coring methods significantly underestimated RF content at all rocky sites, but significant differences (p is less than 0. 05) in SOC stocks between pits and corers were only found with the hammer method using the fixed-depth approach at the less than 0. 01 cubic meters per cubic <b>meter</b> <b>RF</b> site (pit, 5. 80 kilograms C per square meter; hammer, 4. 74 kilograms C per square meter) and at the 0. 14 cubic meters per cubic <b>meter</b> <b>RF</b> site (pit, 8. 81 kilograms C per square meter; hammer, 6. 71 kilograms C per square meter). The hammer corer also underestimated rho (sub b) at all sites as did the hydraulic push corer at the 0. 21 cubic meters per cubic <b>meter</b> <b>RF</b> site. No significant differences in mass-based SOC stock estimates were observed between pits and corers. Our results indicate that (i) calculating SOC stocks on a mass basis can overcome biases in RF and rho (sub b) estimates introduced by sampling equipment and (ii) a quantitative pit is the optimal sampling method for establishing reference soil masses, followed by rotary and then hydraulic push corers...|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of a high-current ion beam in background plasma is of considerable interest for many experiments. It has been shown, that the stopping power for heavy ions of {{fully ionised plasma}} is up to forty times higher than of cold gases. For this reason {{a new kind of}} gas discharge plasma target is now under investigation at Frankfurt University. The main advantage of this new plasma target is a electrode less configuration. Due to new experimental and theoretical insights [1], the energy deposition into the plasma was performed by capacitive coupling. Confinement of the plasma was achieved using a static quadrupole field. According to [2] the confinement of the RF plasma may be achieved by the stronger focusing than defocusing forces on the alternating electrons during the discharge. A <b>RF</b> power <b>meter</b> enabled us to compare the efficiency of the capacitive coupling to the inductive coupling. Clearly the capacitive coupling has the best performance. The capacitive coupling achieved a maximum efficiency of 92 % at 40 MHz with 200 W of RF-power deposited inside the plasma, where the inductive coupling mechanism struggled to achieve 20 % at 20 MHz with 35 W of RF power inside the plasma load.

40|$|Abstract. Tether {{electron}} current {{collection in the}} Orbital Motion Limited regime {{is one of the}} limiting factors in power and thrust generation applications of electrodynamic tethers. Injection of radio frequency power along tethers is considered in order to enhance {{electron current}} collection. As a basic assessment tool, Particle-In-Cell modeling of the tether system is performed using a 1 -d cylindrical code. Comparison of test electron trajectories shows that the time periodic field distribution created by the RF excitation results in electrons being scattered off their usual OML trajectories, which under some conditions increases their probability of being collected by the tether. Analysis of simulation results reveals that large current enhancements can occur at resonance frequencies of the input reactance (where Xin = 0), but at the expense of high RF power. Current enhancement is best measured in terms of the relative current variation per unit of RF power dissipated for every 1 -meter section of the tether.

40|$|In {{order that}} it may be built within a {{reasonable}} length and with reasonable ac power consumption, a 5 TeV linear collider must employ an accelerating gradient and rf frequency which are both higher than for present 1 TeV collider designs. The required peak <b>rf</b> power per <b>meter,</b> which will also be higher than for 1 TeV designs, can be provided either by relatively conventional rf technology or by a two-beam scheme such as that proposed for CLIC. In this paper the first alternative, a 30 GHz rf system employing microwave tube power sources together with rf pulse compression, is described which produces an accelerating gradient on the order of 200 MV per meter. Limitations on the peak power that can be obtained from conventional klystrons as a function of frequency are discussed; it is found that such klystrons are only marginally adequate as a power source at 30 GHz. Several alternative rf sources, such as multiple-beam klystrons, sheet-beam klystrons, gyroklystrons and annular-beam ubitrons are described which are capable of providing the required power, after pulse compression, of about 600 MW per meter. 1...|$|R

40|$|Future (nonsuperconducting) linear {{colliders}} {{will require}} very high values of peak <b>rf</b> power per <b>meter</b> of accelerating structure. The role of rf pulse compression in producing this power is examined {{within the context}} of overall rf system design for three future colliders at energies of 1. 0 - 1. 5 TeV, 5 TeV and 25 TeV. In order keep the average AC input power and the length of the accelerator within reasonable limits, a collider in the 1. 0 - 1. 5 TeV energy range will probably be built at an I x-band rf frequency, and will require a peak power on the order of 150 - 200 MW per meter of accelerating structure. A 5 TeV collider at 34 GHz with a reasonable length (35 km) and AC input power (225 MW) would require about 550 MW per meter of structure. Two-beam accelerators can achieve peak powers of this order by applying dc pulse compression techniques (induction linac modules) to produce the drive beam. Klystron-driven colliders achieve high peak power by a combination of dc pulse compression (modulators) and rf pulse compression, with about the same overall rf system efficiency (30 - 40 %) as a two-beam collider.

The pulse magnetic field {{in the form of}} a binary pseudo-random process or a pulse field with constant frequency of some few tens Hz was used. A couple of Helmholz coils or a small magneto-therapeutic apparatus were used as the applicator. The maximum value of the magnetic flux density reached 60 mT. A forearm of a person under test was exposed to a magnetic field and there was measured the bio-impedance. Bio-impedance was evaluated by a narrowband <b>RF</b> vector impedance <b>meter</b> by use of four-point method. A rising level of the bio-impedance signal at about 60 % was indicated during the 15 minutes exposure by a magnetic field.

40|$|Abstract- The {{spectrum}} licensing {{issues and}} interference at unlicensed ISM bands limits the market penetration. Though emerging license-free bands appear promising, {{they still have}} certain bandwidth and range limitations. The advantage of FSO communication over Fiber Optic communication (FO) is that, {{there is no time}} and money wasting trench digging involved, for laying the optical fiber cables underground and no acquiring of road digging permission from the municipality, because the optical carrier signal travels through the atmosphere. Optical wireless (FSO) can augment <b>RF</b> and milli <b>meter</b> wave links with very high (> 1 Gb/s) bandwidth. In fact, it is widely believed that optical wireless is best suited for multi-Gb/s communication. As this is a telecommunication technology that transmits data in the form of optical signals across the air and, as such, can be considered as a wireless (line-of-sight) transmission system; which is being capable of handling data rates at the Gbps level, does not require licensing, and can be deployed at one-fifth of the cost of fiber; also, the narrow beams employed in the transmission of signals are very difficult to be affected by jamming,interception or interference. This article reviews the FSO Link suitability for achieving reduced error communication. With its high-data-rate capacity and wide bandwidth on unregulated spectrum, FSO communication is a promising solution for the ―last mile ‖ problem, however its performance is highly vulnerable to adverse atmospheric conditions. A number of phenomena in the atmosphere, such as absorption, scattering, and turbulence, can affect beam attenuation, {{but in the case of}} wavelengths typical of FSO systems operation, only scattering and turbulence are appropriate to be taken into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Once the {{disrupted}} electrons {{have cleared}} the detector, {{taken to be}} 5 m along the IP, using essentially a quadrupole doublet, we observe where the disrupted beam crosses the photon beam using third order TURTLE. Because this was nearly 20 m from the IP and it took 10 m {{to get the full}} energy beam moving parallel toward the dump, we nd the rst available space for diagnostics between 11 and 16 <b>meters.</b> <b>RF</b> BPMs [5] are assumed to begin at 5 m where the outgoing beams are still small and C-Band cavities could have apertures comparable to the quads (= 4). The rst dipole of a horizontal chicane, used to separate the outgoing photon and electron beams, begins at 16 m. It allows separate experiments, before recombining both beams into a common dump. Figure 1 shows the Twiss functions when the four bends are sized to separate the two beams by 12. Their maximum separation is x = 2 B(1, cos B) +L 1 tan B where B is the bend angle for the full energy of any one rectangular dipole of length LB = B sin B and L 1 is the separation between bends BD 1 and BD 2. Notice that this is just the dispersion x {{in the center of the}} chicane. This separation requires a minimum distance of Lmin = 2 Bsin B + L 1 : The change in the bunch separation, due to the chicane, after this point in the central region is R 56 = lz p=p = 2 B(tan B, B) +L 1 tan 2 B: This is proportional to the RF phase shift[6]. Thus we have a common beam pipe and su cient dispersion to measure the energy and spread of the undisrupted beam.

40|$|This thesis proposes {{about the}} method for {{locating}} {{the source of}} ultrasonic signals and to detect {{the different types of}} partial discharges (PD) i. e. external and internal discharges on cable insulation. PD are the electric discharges in insulating material that does not bridge a pair of electrodes completely. The magnitude of PD is small, but, it can cause deterioration and may lead to brekdown. External PD was created by removing some of the portion of the insulation midway along the length of 5 <b>meters</b> <b>RF</b> Uniradio cable exposing the braid to the air. Internal PD was created by piercing small holes (0. 8, 1, 2 and 3 milimetres) on the middle layer of a threeparallel sheet of wacker silicone rubber so that it creates void at the inner part of the insulation. The external and internal PD test setup were subjected to a voltage supply of 5 kV to 20 kV in 2. 5 kV level increment, and lkV to 6 kV in lkV increment, respectively. The voltage is supplied to the test jigs from low voltage then increased gradually to observe the PD activity in the insulation. The voltage is stopped as the discharges becoming audible and the existence of the spark at the insulation started to occur. The emitted sounds of the external and internal PD are laudable to naked ears at 12. 5 kV and 5 kV respectively. The ultrasonic waves emitted by the PD detector by ultrasonic detector known as the Ultraprobe 2000, where it translate the ultrasonic signal into electrical signal and with the aid of signal converter, the signal can be recorded in the PC. These signals emitted from the discharges are known as faulty signals. The ultrasonic waves of the samples prior {{to the creation of the}} holes were also recorded in similar manner. These signals are known as healthy signals. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet Analysis (WA) were employed for analysis. With FFT, the signals are represented in frequency-domain and the trend of signal the PD can be detected and be located. There are significant changes in FFT plots for faulty signals when comparing with the FFT plots for healthy signals. The peak magnitude lies on the low frequency range if the signal is healthy, meanwhile, if the signal is faulty, then the peak magnitude lies at the high frequency range. WA analyzes signal in time-domain in order to search for basic or commonly recurring pattern. Here, WA employed the dyadic down sampling technique in the analyses where the procedures taken in order to determine the suitable mother wavelet and its number of level. Each resulting signal produced from the dyadic is compared to the original signal. With different void sizes, it shows that the discharges at larger void size, the lower the peak frequency i. e 4 kV, just before the discharges become audible. It was found that these analyses are able to predict the patterns of faulty signals clearer than the original ultrasonic signals. For the case of external PD, it was found that the suitable mother wavelet is Daubechies at the number of level 7 (db 7). For internal PD, the best mother wavelet is Symlet with the number of level 3 (sym 3) ...|$|R
