A {{decrease}} in the n-layer sheet resistance, with a consequent increase in was detected after complete removal of the p-layer, due {{to a reduction in}} the n-layer depletion region. An increase in RF-dispersion was experienced, {{as a result of the}} progressive reduction of screening from surface-states originally provided by the overlying p-cap layer. No dispersion was detected before cap removal. A continuous increase in and was detected even before complete removal of the p-layer, due to virtual gate length reduction. It is expected that an optimized p-doped overlayer will provide current slump suppression without degradation in cutoff frequency or breakdown. Index Terms—GaN, JFET, passivation, RF-dispersion.
