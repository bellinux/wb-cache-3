2500|$|Lost Forest {{is home to}} {{a number}} of bird species as well. [...] They include pinyon jay, black-billed magpie, <b>red-shafted</b> <b>flicker,</b> Brewer's blackbird, American robin, {{mountain}} bluebird, western tanager, sage sparrow, loggerhead shrike, and sapsucker. [...] There are also birds of prey such as prairie falcon, red-tailed hawks, and golden eagles.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-shafted</b> <b>flicker</b> (C. a. cafer) {{resides in}} western North America. They are red under the tail and underwings and have red shafts on their primaries. They have a beige cap and a grey face. Males have a red moustache. The subspecific name, C. a. cafer, {{is the result}} of an error made in 1788 by the German systematist Johann Gmelin, who {{believed}} that its original habitat was in South Africa among the Xhosa people, then known as the [...] "Kaffirs".|$|E
50|$|Birds are common, {{and there}} are 59 species present during at least some years. Seven {{different}} raptors are found, the turkey vulture, American kestrel, golden eagle, ferruginous hawk, red-tailed hawk, Mississippi kite, and the prairie falcon, {{all of which are}} classed as being of least concern according to the IUCN. There is one other bird of prey, the western screech-owl. There are no waterfowl found on Black Mesa. The mourning dove, greater roadrunner, common nighthawk, common poorwill, ladder-backed woodpecker, <b>red-shafted</b> <b>flicker,</b> olive-sided flycatcher, Say's phoebe, ash-throated flycatcher, Cassin's kingbird, and western kingbird are also found. There are five corvids; the black-billed magpie, pinyon jay, American crow, and common raven, as well as the more local Chihuahuan raven.61 species of butterfly are found in the preserve, including seventeen skippers, three swallowtails, four hairstreaks, a copper, four whites, nine true brushfoots, two satyrs, and a leafwing.|$|E

50|$|A bird checklist, {{available}} at the visitor center, listed of over 100 species {{that can be found}} in the area. These include notable species such as hawks, golden eagles, killdeer, Gambel's quail, great blue herons, and <b>red-shafted</b> <b>flickers.</b> Many mammals can also be seen in the park, such as gray foxes, bobcats, badgers, prairie dogs, desert cottontails, jackrabbits, and porcupines. Reptiles found in the area include the Hopi rattlesnake, western king rattlesnake, horned lizards, common collared lizards, bull snakes, and desert spiny lizards.|$|R
2500|$|Animals {{common in}} the forest around the cave include golden-mantled ground squirrels, chipmunks, western gray squirrels, porcupines, weasels, pine martens, and mule deer. [...] In 1991, park {{personnel}} observed a full-grown cougar {{run out of the}} cave entrance area, but that was a single sighting. There is also a wide range of resident and migratory bird species common to the area. [...] Small resident birds include wrens, robins, juncos, thrushes, woodpeckers, sapsuckers, <b>red-shafted</b> <b>flickers,</b> and ruby-crowned kinglets. Larger birds include great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, vultures, and a few golden eagles.|$|R
50|$|Burrough Valley is habitat to {{many animals}} and birds, {{including}} black-tailed deer, mountain lion, bobcat, coyote, cottontail, gray squirrel, California ground squirrel, and many smaller rodents. Wild pigs were introduced or {{migrated to the}} area in the 1980s. Feral pigs, which escaped from early settlers, were once common in the 1900s and early 20th century. Reptiles inhabiting the area include the northern Pacific rattlesnake, gopher snake, two species of king snake, garter snake, northern alligator lizard, western fence lizard, skink, and whiptail lizard. The area’s amphibians include the tree frog, California newt, several species of salamander, toad, and American bull frog, which was introduced in the 19th century. The foothill yellow-legged frog once was common, but is now rare. Golden eagles occasionally soar high above the valley and make their nests in the remote rocky crags on the mountain tops. Red-tailed hawks often ride afternoon thermals. There are also Cooper’s hawks, sharp-shinned hawks, merlins and kestrels. Turkey vultures spend most {{of the year in the}} area but migrate south in winter. Crows are common. Other birds include meadow larks, mourning doves, starlings, scrub jays, Steller’s jays, blackbirds, sparrows, towhees, western bluebirds, Wilson’s warblers, western flycatchers, titmice, humming birds, and many other small birds. Wild turkeys, introduced in the 1960s, are common. Band-tailed pigeons enter the valley in the fall and winter to feast on acorns. The commonest bird is perhaps the acorn woodpecker, whose raucous laugh can be heard nearly every daytime moment. Several other species of woodpeckers are found, including the <b>red-shafted</b> <b>flicker,</b> Lewis's woodpecker and downy woodpecker. California valley quail are also common, with their call “chi-ca-GO! chi-chi-ca-GO!” heard frequently.|$|E
40|$|Fading {{behavior}} of undyed feathers {{has not received}} much attention in conservation literature {{and as a result}} feathers are categorized with other natural materials as being fugitive to display lighting, based on anecdotal evidence. The authors investigated <b>Red-shafted</b> <b>Flicker</b> feathers, which have carotenoid-based colorant systems and significance in North American native regalia, to demonstrate how lighting guidelines could be informed by a multivariate approach that considers material sensitivity, properties of value, and use before entering a museum collection. Ornithological literature reviewed demonstrates that feathers are highly differentiated in their sources of coloration, which include chemistry, structure, diet, age and,gender, all resulting in varying responses to illumination. The authors explore the value placed on color by original fabricators, and how use and attitudes toward color contribute to the collections for which we assume stewardship. <b>Red-shafted</b> <b>Flicker</b> feathers were exposed to equivalent photometric doses in order to compare results from window-fading and microfading to Blue Wool Standards. Results indicate color changes more stable than Blue Wool 1 and 2, with ultraviolet radiation playing a significant role in fading. Microfading is beneficial for measuring color change because the variability within and between feathers is eliminated as the sample site remains unvaried...|$|E
40|$|The Yellow-shafted Flicker (Colaptes auratus auratus) and <b>Red-shafted</b> <b>Flicker</b> (C. a. cafer) form a stable, narrow hybrid zone on {{the western}} Great Plains of North America. Allozyme data were {{obtained}} from 31 structural gene loci for 33 samples representing 246 Northern Flickers from throughout the Great Plains. Flickers were approximately equivalent to other birds in terms of proportion of polymorphic loci (P = 0. 207) and average heterozygosity (H = 0. 056). There was no concordant variation between plumage characters and allelic frequencies. Gene-diversity analysis indicated that 92. 5 % of the genic variation occurred as within-deme heterozygosity (GD = 0. 925), approximately 7 % occurred among individual demes (GST= 0. 07), and only 0. 9 % occurred among major river drainages (GST = 0. 009). Even less diversity was found among parental and hybrid groups (GST = 0. 002). There is substantial allozymic structuring of the Northern Flicker species population, but the structuring is not associated with the hybrid zone, and there is, at most, very weak structuring into riparian zones of habitat. The electrophoretic data support the inference that gene flow among Northern Flicker populations is high (Nm = 1. 9 - 4. 4 /generation). If the high gene-flow estimates are correct, then geographical selection gradients {{would be the most}} likely mechanism maintaining the narrow hybrid zone of plumage and morphometric traits...|$|E
40|$|During a {{visit to}} Isla Guadalupe from 31 May to 3 June 1996, we {{documented}} three species new to the island, the Barn Owl, Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Thrush, and Hooded Oriole, and established first breeding records for the European Starling and Western Meadowlark. <b>Red-shafted</b> <b>Flickers</b> are now breeding on the island, representing a recent recolonization from the mainland following the extinction of the endemic population. We investigated the validity of Colaptes auratus rufipileus and concluded that it doesn’t meet the standard for phylogenetic species but differs from C. a. collaris at the 75...|$|R
40|$|The bounded-hybrid superiority {{hypothesis}} (BHSH) predicts stable hybrid {{zones are}} characterized by hybrids having the highest fitness within the zone. The dynamic-equilibrium hypothesis (DEH) predicts hybrids to have the lowest fitness and mating should be strongly assortative in the hybrid zone. I used phenotypic-based hybrid indices (HI) to assess mating patterns, reproductive success, and survival of hybridizing northern flickers (Colaptes auratus) within the hybrid zone at Riske Creek, British Columbia. Contrary to the BHSH, flickers showed significant assortative pairing (P = 0. 038) which may result via passive mate choice if yellow and red flickers migrate from allopatric winter ranges. North American band recoveries show <b>red-shafted</b> and yellow-shafted <b>flickers</b> winter on different sides of the Rocky Mountains while red-orange hybrids from Riske Creek winter {{in the range of}} <b>red-shafted</b> <b>flickers.</b> Arrival dates of phenotypes did not support the idea that mating patterns are caused passively via different arrival schedules. However, assortative mating patterns did correlate with regional weather patterns along flicker migration routes as well as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) a continental weather pattern that has been shown to influence various aspects of the annual cycle in other birds. If variable weather patterns result in different mating patterns by affecting migration, the geographic location of the northern portion of the zone may be variable due to the migratory behaviour of individuals. There were no differences among yellow, orange and red flickers to win more agonistic contests or have earlier nest initiation dates, larger clutch sizes, greater hatching success, or produce more fledglings. No colour group had a higher likelihood of having a successful compared to a depredated nesting attempt. Aggression was similar between red (N = 21) and yellow flickers (N = 20) during taxidermy model presentations of pure <b>red-shafted</b> and yellow-shafted <b>flickers.</b> Using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) in Program MARK, I determined survival was best modeled as either constant between males and females or varying annually according to weather. Models incorporating HI had less support but suggested that survival is best modeled as a linear relationship where <b>red-shafted</b> <b>flickers</b> have the highest survival. Survival modeled in quadratic relationships found hybrid flickers to have the highest apparent survival estimates in support of the BHSH. Overall there was no support for reduced hybrid fitness, but survival appears to be influenced more by annual variation rather than strictly by an individual’s HI. Overall, I failed to find reduced hybrid fitness in support of the DEH but also failed to find increased hybrid fitness as predicted by the BHSH. Annual changes in selection pressure could prevent introgression of hybrid genes throughout the zone if selection favours red-shafted genes in some years and yellow-shafted genes in other years...|$|R
5000|$|The Ohlone subsisted {{mainly as}} hunter-gatherers {{and in some}} ways harvesters. [...] "A rough {{husbandry}} of the land was practiced, mainly by annually setting of fires to burn-off the old growth {{in order to get a}} better yield of seeds—or so the Ohlone told early explorers in San Mateo County." [...] Their staple diet consisted of crushed acorns, nuts, grass seeds, and berries, although other vegetation, hunted and trapped game, fish and seafood (including mussels and abalone from the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean), were also important to their diet. These food sources were abundant in earlier times and maintained by careful work, and through active management of all the natural resources at hand. Animals in their mild climate included the grizzly bear, elk (Cervus elaphus), pronghorn, and deer. The streams held salmon, perch, and stickleback. Birds included plentiful ducks, geese, quail, great horned owls, <b>red-shafted</b> <b>flickers,</b> downy woodpeckers, goldfinches, and yellow-billed magpies. Waterfowl were the most important birds in the people's diet, which were captured with nets and decoys. The Chochenyo traditional narratives refer to ducks as food, and Juan Crespí observed in his journal that geese were stuffed and dried [...] "to use as decoys in hunting others". 49% of the headmasters were female.|$|R
40|$|New in this Seasonal Report, {{direct from}} the American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union (along with Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Snipe, Rock Pigeon, etc.), is the {{modified}} checklist order, featuring geese, swans, and ducks at the beginning, followed by gallinaceous birds, then resuming the familiar order with loons. Perhaps {{the most important}} use for these reports, {{in addition to their}} incorporation into the Southern Great Plains Region summary in North American Birds, is the noting of significant avian events in Nebraska. Some are of obvious importance, but the meaning of others is obscure, perhaps only to be revealed as subsequent reports show a trend, or events noted in Nebraska are corroborated by the same events noted in the other Southern Great Plains states, in Kansas and Oklahoma, or even on a national level. Such events discussed in this report include a good showing of scoters, hints of a recovery of the Gray Partridge population, a sighting of 7 + migrating Mississippi Kites, a Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker in Sowbelly Canyon, indications of declines in numbers of Black-billed Magpie, American Crow, and Black-capped Chickadee, westerly Carolina Wrens, rather low numbers of thrushes and warblers, westerly Rose-breasted Grosbeaks possibly breeding, good numbers of Purple Finches, no reports of Red Crossbills after 27 Sep, and few Pine Siskins. A similar category of events, but perhaps better labeled 2 ̆ 2 quirky, 2 ̆ 2 were some strange bobwhite items from the Panhandle, the occurrence of Eurasian Collared-Doves in 74 counties so far, the possibility that the Curve-billed Thrasher at the Frimann Ranch in Sioux County was able to sneak its genes into the Brown Thrasher pool, a Blue Grosbeak carrying a minnow, and an Orange Bishop (a bird, not a Dutch prelate) in Kearney. Among significant early or late dates of occurrence were record late Caspian Terns, Panhandle Gray Catbird, and Bobolink (although the Boblink was unsubstantiated), second-latest Forster 2 ̆ 7 s Tern and Western Kingbird, and record early Northern (<b>Red-Shafted)</b> <b>Flickers</b> eastward. In-your-face numbers were the 321 Hooded Mergansers at L Yankton, 5 Yellow-crowned Night-Herons in the eastern Rainwater Basin, a fall record 247 Upland Sandpipers there also, an almost-record 283 Buff-breasted Sandpipers also in the eastern Rainwater Basin, 26, 000 Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gulls at L McConaughy, a record 14 Caspian Terns at Branched Oak L, 30 + Burrowing Owls at a Scotts Bluff County location, and a record 12 Brown Creepers at Arbor Day Farm. And for rarity buffs and state listers, there was limited joy this fall. Best were the 3 rd state record Yellow-billed Loon at L McConaughy and 5 th state record Tricolored Heron in the eastern Rainwater Basin. Significant also was a 3 rd state fall record Hudsonian Godwit, at L McConaughy. Important Panhandle records were a first record Summer Tanager (of the western subspecies cooperi), 2 nd record Ruby-throated Hummingbird (as well as a 2 nd record Archilochus hummingbird), 2 nd record Winter Wren, first fall record Baltimore Oriole, 2 nd fall record Mourning Warbler, and 3 rd fall record Rose-breasted Grosbeak, a male. Other important records were a Tufted Titmouse at Ponca SP, apparently the same bird that was there in May, and the 8 th fall record Rock Wren in the southeast...|$|R
