5|$|Beringia {{received}} more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover {{from the north}} Pacific Ocean {{than the rest of}} the Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. Moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the airflow from the North Pacific. This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological <b>refugium</b> for plants and animals. In this Beringian <b>refugium,</b> eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors. Steppe bison (Bison priscus), Yukon horse (Equus lambei), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and Wild yak (Bos mutus) consumed grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plants. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and woodland muskox (Symbos cavifrons) consumed tundra plants, including lichen, fungi, and mosses.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only have}} the {{symbionts}} and specific species been shown to shift, {{but there seems to}} be a certain growth rate favorable to selection. Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have become more common. The changes in temperature and acclimation are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a <b>refugium</b> location that will help them adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes colonised the North American {{continent}} in two waves: {{during or}} before the Illinoian glaciation, {{and during the}} Wisconsinan glaciation. Gene mapping demonstrates that red foxes in North America have been isolated from their Old World counterparts for over 400,000 years, thus raising the possibility that speciation has occurred, and that the previous binomial name of Vulpes fulva may be valid. In the far north, red fox fossils {{have been found in}} Sangamonian deposits in the Fairbanks District and Medicine Hat. Fossils dating from the Wisconsian are present in 25 sites in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming. Although they ranged far south during the Wisconsinan, the onset of warm conditions shrank their range toward the north, and have only recently reclaimed their former American ranges because of human-induced environmental changes. Genetic testing indicates two distinct red fox refugia exist in North America, which have been separated since the Wisconsinan. The northern (or boreal) <b>refugium</b> occurs in Alaska and western Canada, and consists of the large subspecies V.v.alascensis, V.v.abietorum, V.v.regalis, and V.v.rubricosa. The southern (or montane) <b>refugium</b> occurs in the subalpine parklands and alpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, the Cascade Range, and Sierra Nevada. It encompasses the subspecies V.v.macroura, V.v.cascadensis, and V.v.necator. The latter clade has been separated from all other red fox populations since the last glacial maximum, and may possess unique ecological or physiological adaptations.|$|E

5|$|The {{starling}} family, Sturnidae, is {{an entirely}} Old World group apart from introductions elsewhere, with the greatest numbers of species in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Sturnus is polyphyletic and relationships between its members are not fully resolved. The closest relation of the common starling is the spotless starling. The non-migratory spotless starling may be descended from a population of ancestral S. vulgaris that survived in an Iberian <b>refugium</b> during an ice age retreat, and mitochondrial gene studies suggest {{that it could be}} considered as a subspecies of the common starling. There is more genetic variation between common starling populations than between nominate common starling and spotless starling. Although common starling remains are known from the Middle Pleistocene, part of the problem in resolving relationships in the Sturnidae is the paucity of the fossil record for the family as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The species breeds in North America and {{winters in}} the Caribbean. Some studies have {{observed}} {{significant differences in}} terms of migratory behavior and plumage color between northern and southern populations within the breeding range. The northern population mainly winters in the western Caribbean (Cuba and Jamaica) while the southern population usually spends the winter on eastern islands (Hispaniola and Puerto Rico). Moreover, males in the southern population have darker plumage {{than those in the}} northern population. These differences have led biologists to consider them as separate subspecies. However, a recent study in the United States reveals no significant genetic differentiation between northern (samples from Michigan, New Hampshire and New York states) and southern populations (sample from North Carolina). The study results actually show a recent population expansion from a single glacial <b>refugium,</b> therefore the current populations are homogeneous in terms of genetics. The differentiation that is observed between the northern and southern populations should have occurred quite recently.|$|E

40|$|Main {{results of}} allozyme-geographical {{study of the}} polymorphism, {{differentiation}} and origin of natural Pinus sylvestris L. populations in 6 phylogeographical regions – Middle Siberian Tableland, Lena-Angara Tableland, South Siberia Mountains, Near-Baikalia, Western Trans-Baikalia and Northern Mongolia – have been briefly analyzed and generalized. A relative homogeneity of the population polymorphism in these regions has been revealed, {{with the exception of}} marginal ones (Tura, Ulan-Bator). Genetic distances of M. Nei (1978, DN 78) between the extremely remote populations in the investigated regions reach the level of the geographical race, but they are several time lesser in the regions’ limits – not more of the genosystmatic level of the middle differentiated local populations (DN 78 = 0. 010 – 0. 012). The geographical group of the South Siberia Mountains stand apart distinctly (DN 78 = 0. 018 ± 0. 004) in the genogeographical structure of P. sylvestris on the basis of Nei`s genetic distances analysis and of the genosystematic scale (Sannikov, Petrova, 2012). Besides the Selenga population group (in the rank of local population, DN 78 = 0. 013), also as well the Angara-Yenisei and North-Baikal population group (in the rank of subpopulation, DN 78 = 0. 004 – 0. 008) stand apart {{on the rest of the}} territory. Gradient-analysis of the genetic distances revealed the borders between the phylogeographical groups of pine populations on the Lena-Angara and Central-Siberian plateaus, on the one hand, in the South Siberia Mountains, Near-Baikal and Trans-Baikalia, on the other hand, and an important role of l. Baikal as a barrier of the migration and differentiation of the populations. As an analysis result of minimal genetic distances between 25 P. sylvestris populations in the south «non-glacial» zone and the group of 8 populations in the «glacial» zone 4 main <b>refugiums</b> (South-Near-Baikal, South-Ural, Upper-Vitim and Upper-Olekma) and several secondary <b>refugiums</b> have been revealed...|$|R

5000|$|Interest {{in using}} algae for {{nutrient}} control once again increased, {{this time in}} the form of keeping the algae in a [...] "sump" [...] or other small aquarium which was connected to the main aquarium via plumbing.

Sumps or other small aquariums used for this purpose became known as [...] "refugiums". The name [...] "refugium" [...] was used because the growing algae provided a safe place for small and microscopic animals to breed and grow, and thus was a [...] "refuge" [...] from the large fish and invertebrates in the main aquarium that would otherwise consume them. However while the <b>refugiums</b> did indeed consume nutrients from the water, they did not consume them fast enough in all situations; this caused many hobbyists to continue to have nuisance algae problems in their main aquariums.|$|R

25|$|Live copepods {{are used}} in the {{saltwater}} aquarium hobby as a food source and are generally considered beneficial in most reef tanks.

25|$|Aberdeen is at {{the eastern}} end of Grays Harbor, near the mouth of the Chehalis River and {{southwest}} of the Olympic Mountains. Grays Harbor is notable as the northernmost ria on North America's Pacific Coast because it has remained free of glaciers throughout the Quaternary due to unfavorable topography and warm temperatures.

25|$|The {{region of}} modern-day Croatia may {{have served as}} a <b>refugium</b> for the {{northern}} populations during the last glacial maximum (LGM). The eastern Adriatic coast was much further south.

The region had a specific role in the structuring of European, and particularly among Slavic, paternal genetic heritage, characterized by the predominance of R1a and I, and scarcity of E lineages.

25|$|The {{specifics}} of Paleo-Indian migration to {{and throughout the}} Americas, including the exact dates and routes traveled, {{are the subject of}} ongoing research and discussion. According to archaeological and genetic evidence, North and South America were the last continents in the world to gain human habitation. During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the land bridge of Beringia that joined Siberia to northwest North America (Alaska). Alaska was a glacial <b>refugium</b> because it had low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of North America, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.|$|E
25|$|Melanesians are not {{the only}} modern-day {{descendants}} of Denisovans. David Reich of Harvard University, in collaboration with Mark Stoneking of the Planck Institute team, found genetic evidence that Denisovan ancestry is shared also by Australian Aborigines, and smaller scattered groups of people in South-East Asia, such as the Mamanwa, a Negrito people in the Philippines though not all Negritos were found to possess Denisovan genes; Onge Andaman Islanders and Malaysian Jehai, for example, were found to have no significant Denisovan inheritance. These data place the interbreeding event in mainland South-East Asia, and suggest that Denisovans once ranged widely over eastern Asia. Based on the modern distribution of Denisova DNA, Denisovans may have crossed the Wallace Line, with Wallacea serving as their last <b>refugium.</b> A paper by Kay Prüfer in 2013 said that mainland Asians and Native Americans had around 0.2% Denisovan ancestry.|$|E
25|$|From a {{mitochondrial}} DNA perspective, haplogroup H, {{which has}} high incidence (≈40%) throughout Europe, has received similar attention. Early studies by Richards et al (2000) {{suggested that it}} arose 28–23 kya (thousand years ago), spreading into Europe ≈20kya, before then re-expanding from an Iberian glacial refuge ≈15 kya, calculations subsequently corroborated by Pereira et al. (2005). However, a larger study by Roostalu et al. (2007), incorporating more data from the Near East, suggested that whilst Hg H did begin to expand kya, this {{was limited to the}} Near East, Caucasus and Southeastern Europe. Rather its subsequent spread further west occurred later, in the post-glacial period from a postulated South Caucasian <b>refugium.</b> This hypothesis has been supported by a recent ancient DNA analysis study, which links the expansion of mtDNA Hg H in Western Europe with the Bell Beaker phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|During the Ice Age a vast, {{cold and}} dry Mammoth steppe {{stretched}} from the arctic islands southwards to China, and from Spain eastwards across Eurasia {{and over the}} Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon where it was blocked by the Wisconsin glaciation. The land bridge existed because sea-levels were lower because more of the planet's water than today was locked up in glaciers. Therefore, {{the flora and fauna}} of Beringia were more related to those of Eurasia rather than North America. Beringia received more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover from the north Pacific Ocean {{than the rest of the}} Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided a ecological <b>refugium</b> for plants and animals. In East Beringia 35,000 YBP, the northern arctic areas experienced temperatures 1.5 C degrees warmer than today but the southern sub-Arctic regions were 2 C degrees cooler. During the LGM 22,000 YBP the average summer temperature was 3–5 C degrees cooler than today, with variations of 2.9 C degrees cooler on the Seward Peninsula to 7.5 C cooler in the Yukon. In the driest and coldest periods of the Late Pleistocene, and possibly during the entire Pleistocene, moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the air-flow from the North Pacific.|$|E
25|$|In the Late Pleistocene, Beringia was {{a mosaic}} of {{biological}} communities. Commencing from BP (MIS 3), steppe–tundra vegetation dominated large parts of Beringia with a rich diversity of grasses and herbs. There were patches of shrub tundra with isolated refugia of larch (Larix) and spruce (Picea) forests with birch (Betula) and alder (Alnus) trees. It has been proposed that {{the largest and most}} diverse megafaunal community residing in Beringia at this time could only have been sustained in a highly diverse and productive environment. Analysis at Chukotka on the Siberian edge of the land bridge indicated that from BP (MIS 3 to MIS 2) the environment was wetter and colder than the steppe–tundra to the east and west, with warming in parts of Beringia from BP. These changes provided the most likely explanation for mammal migrations after BP, as the warming provided increased forage for browsers and mixed feeders. Beringia did not block the movement of most dry steppe-adapted large species such as saiga antelope, woolly mammoth, and caballid horses. However, from the west the woolly rhino went no further east than the Anadyr River, and from the east North American camels, the American kiang-like equids, the short-faced bear, bonnet-horned muskoxen, and badger did not travel west. At the beginning of the Holocene, some mesic habitat-adapted species left the <b>refugium</b> and spread westward into what had become tundra-vegetated northern Asia and eastward into northern North America.|$|E
500|$|On {{the basis}} of {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequence analysis, Myotis alcathoe first appeared close to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus) of southern Europe, North Africa, and southwestern Asia. However, {{a study of the}} mitochondrial cytochrome b gene incorporating many Myotis species did not support this relationship, and could not place M.alcathoe securely at a specific position among Eurasian Myotis. Two groups with slightly divergent mitochondrial DNA sequences (separated by 1.3 to 1.4% sequence divergence) are distinguishable within the species, which probably correspond to different glacial refugia where M.alcathoe populations survived the last glacial period. One, known as the [...] "Hungarian" [...] group, has been recorded from Spain, France, Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia, and probably corresponds to a <b>refugium</b> in Iberia; the other, the [...] "Greek" [...] group, is known only from Greece and Slovakia.|$|E
500|$|The species {{now known}} as Leucopholiota decorosa was first {{described}} by Charles Peck in 1873, based on a specimen he found in New York State; he placed it in Tricholoma, then considered a subgenus of Agaricus. In 1947, Alexander Smith and Walters transferred the species into the genus Armillaria, based on its apparent close relationship to Armillaria luteovirens; the presence of clamp connections in the hyphae, the amyloid spores, {{and the structure of}} the veil and its remnants. The genus Armillaria, as it was understood at the time, would later be referred to as a [...] "taxonomic <b>refugium</b> for about 270 white-spored species with attached gills and an annulus." [...] Smith later transferred the species to the genus Tricholomopsis; however, he neglected the amyloid spores, the recurved scales of the cap cuticle, and the lack of cells known as pleurocystidia, features which should have ruled out a taxonomic transfer into the genus. In 1987, the species was transferred yet again, this time to the genus Floccularia.|$|E
500|$|An astragalus (ankle bone) {{thought to}} belong to a species of Allosaurus was found at Cape Paterson, Victoria in Early Cretaceous beds in southeastern Australia. It was thought to provide {{evidence}} that Australia was a <b>refugium</b> for animals that had gone extinct elsewhere. This identification was challenged by Samuel Welles, who thought it more resembled that of an ornithomimid, but the original authors defended their identification. With fifteen years of new specimens and research to look at, Daniel Chure reexamined the bone and found that it was not Allosaurus, but could represent an allosauroid. Similarly, Yoichi Azuma and Phil Currie, in their description of Fukuiraptor, noted that the bone closely resembled that of their new genus. This specimen is sometimes referred to as [...] "Allosaurus robustus", an informal museum name. It may have belonged to something similar to, or the same as, Australovenator, or it may represent an abelisaur.

500|$|Coastal {{southern}} California from 60,000YBP {{to the end}} of the Last Glacial Maximum was {{cooler and}} with a more balanced supply of moisture than today.

By 24,000YBP, the abundance of oak and chaparral decreased, but pines increased, creating open parklands similar to today's coastal montane/juniper woodlands. After 14,000YBP, the abundance of conifers decreased, and those of the modern coastal plant communities, including oak woodland, chaparral, and coastal sage scrub, increased. The Santa Monica Plain lies north of the city of Santa Monica and extends along the southern base of the Santa Monica Mountains, and 28,000–26,000YBP it was dominated by coastal sage scrub, with cypress and pines at higher elevations. The Santa Monica Mountains supported a chaparral community on its slopes and isolated coast redwood and dogwood in its protected canyons, along with river communities that included willow, red cedar, and sycamore. These plant communities suggest a winter rainfall similar to that of modern coastal southern California, but the presence of coast redwood now found [...] to the north indicates a cooler, moister, and less seasonal climate than today. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for dire wolves and their competitors.|$|E

However, from BP the Laurentide ice sheet fused with the Cordilleran ice sheet, which blocked gene flow between Beringia (and Eurasia) and continental North America.

2500|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{refers to the}} conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrite and finally nitrate. While fish waste (urine and feces) and decaying matter release ammonia, the majority of ammonia released (approximately 60%) in both marine and freshwater aquariums is excreted directly into {{the water from the}} fishes' gills. Biological (bacterial) nitrification converts the ammonia into nitrite ions, NO2-, and then to nitrate ions, NO3-. Nitrate is readily taken up and assimilated by algae and hermatypic corals. Some nitrate is converted via an anaerobic bacterial process to free nitrogen, but this process is very difficult to maintain. In the recent past, most nitrate, which is less toxic to fishes and most invertebrates than nitrites, accumulated in the water until it was physically removed by a water change. [...] However, many marine aquarists are now employing the use of a special section of the tank or separate tank altogether, called a [...] "refugium." [...] A <b>refugium</b> is, as its name suggests, a sheltered area that shares water with the primary, or display, tank. [...] Refugiums usually contain a deep sand bed to allow anoxic zones to develop within them where anaerobic bacteria can convert nitrate into nitrogen gas, a useful means of nitrate removal. [...] Various types of macroalgae can be grown and harvested from the <b>refugium</b> as another means of nitrate export. [...] As refugiums become more common in marine aquaria, nitrate levels are easily manageable for even the novice hobbyist. [...] Ammonia and nitrite should be tested regularly; any detectable levels (i.e., over 0 ppm) can be indicative of a problem. Nitrates should not exceed 2 ppm in reef tanks, or 20 ppm in fish-only tanks. It is sometimes acceptable to have a small amount of nitrate buildup, as some livestock, especially fish, are fairly tolerant of nitrate. Most corals, while able to assimilate nitrate, cannot be expected to survive, much less thrive, with high nitrate concentrations.|$|E
2500|$|Although similar {{terms in}} other {{languages}} have described an event marking large scale migration {{of a specific}} population from a place of origin, such as the biblical account of Israelites fleeing from Assyrian conquest (circa 740 BCE), in English, the term refugee derives from the root word refuge, from Old French refuge, meaning [...] "hiding place". It refers to [...] "shelter or protection from danger or distress", from Latin fugere, [...] "to flee", and <b>refugium,</b> [...] "a taking [...] refuge, place to flee back to". In Western history, the term was first applied to French Huguenots, after the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540), who again migrated from France after the Edict of Nantes revocation (1685).

2500|$|A hugely [...] {{controversial}} {{theory is}} so-called refugia. This was {{proposed in the}} 1990s by Kalevi Wiik, a professor emeritus of phonetics at the University of Turku. According to this theory, Finno-Ugric speakers spread north as the Ice age ended. They populated central and northern Europe, while Basque speakers populated western Europe. As agriculture spread from the southeast into Europe, the Indo-European languages spread among the hunter-gatherers. In this process, both the hunter-gatherers speaking Finno-Ugric and those speaking Basque learned how to cultivate land and became Indo-Europeanized. According to Wiik, {{this is how the}} Celtic, Germanic, Slavic, and Baltic languages were formed. The linguistic ancestors of modern Finns did not switch their language due to their isolated location. The main supporters of Wiik's theory are Professor Ago Künnap (Univ. of Tartu), Professor Kyösti Julku (Univ. of Oulu) and Associate Professor Angela Marcantonio (Univ. of Rome). Wiik has not presented his theories in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Many scholars in Finno-Ugrian studies have strongly criticized the theory. Especially Professor Raimo Anttila, Petri Kallio and brothers Ante and Aslak Aikio have renounced Wiik's theory with strong words, hinting strongly to pseudoscience and even at right-wing political biases among Wiik's supporters. Moreover, some dismissed the entire idea of refugia, due to the existence even today of arctic and subarctic peoples. The most heated debate took place in the Finnish journal Kaltio during autumn 2002. Since then, the debate has calmed, each side retaining their positions. While the <b>refugium</b> theory proved unpopular among Finns, substantial genotype analyses across the greater European genetic landscape have mostly confirmed the Last Glacial Maximum refugiums to be correct and have substantial backing of the greater scientific community. But this does not in any way corroborate or prove that these 'refugia' spoke Uralic/Finnic, as it belies wholly independent variables that are not necessarily coeval (i.e. language spreads and genetic expansions can occur independently, at different times and in different directions).|$|E
