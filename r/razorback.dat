5|$|The Colorado River had {{experienced}} natural flooding before {{the construction of}} the Hoover Dam. The dam eliminated the natural flooding, which threatened many species adapted to the flooding, including both plants and animals. The construction of the dam devastated the populations of native fish in the river downstream from the dam. Four species of fish native to the Colorado River, the Bonytail chub, Colorado pikeminnow, Humpback chub, and <b>Razorback</b> sucker, are listed as endangered.|$|E

However, {{they were unable to}} score any points as Deion Belue blocked a 41-yard Zach Hocker field goal that preserved the shutout.

5|$|Native fish in Fossil Creek include {{headwater}} chub, roundtail chub, speckled dace, longfin dace, Sonora sucker, {{and desert}} sucker. Between 2007 and 2010, the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added native spikedace, loach minnows, Gila topminnows, and <b>razorback</b> suckers {{as well as}} more longfin dace above the barrier. All except speckled dace are special-status fish listed as endangered, threatened, or sensitive by federal or state agencies. In addition, more than 100 macroinvertebrate species live in the Fossil Creek watershed. One, the fossil springsnail, is listed sensitive by the U.S. Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Infantry Battalion {{arrived at}} ANZAC Cove {{on the evening}} of Anzac Day, 25 April 1915.

Moving in the dark through the thick scrub of the <b>Razorback,</b> the 15th found in the scrub the empty positions that it was sent to fill. The 15th Infantry Battalion was soon switched to Quinn's Post, one of the most exposed parts of the Anzac perimeter, with Cannan becoming post commander.|$|E
5|$|Rivers {{and streams}} in the Colorado basin were once home to 49 species of native fish, of which 42 were endemic. Engineering {{projects}} and river regulation {{have led to}} the extinction of four species and severe declines in the populations of 40 species. Bonytail chub, <b>razorback</b> sucker, Colorado pikeminnow, and humpback chub are among those considered the most at risk; all are unique to the Colorado River system and well adapted to the river's natural silty conditions and flow variations. Clear, cold water released by dams has significantly changed characteristics of habitat for these and other Colorado River basin fishes. A further 40 species that occur in the river today, notably the brown trout, were introduced during the 19th and 20thcenturies, mainly for sport fishing.|$|E

5|$|That night, the Japanese made a minor {{attack against}} 'C' Company, {{but this was}} turned back with {{artillery}} and small arms. The following day the Australians resumed their attack. In doing so, McKinna ordered 'D' Company to renew the assault, aiming for Pear Hill, on the right hand side of the Australian line. Although it required a more physically draining approach march over Artillery Hill and through dense scrub, the tactic {{proved to be more}} successful than the previous day's efforts. Pear Hill was joined by a narrow <b>razorback</b> ridge that limited the Australian frontage to just three men side-by-side, who had to cut their way through the thick bamboo with machetes. Weighed down with full marching order and heavy weapons, including Vickers machine guns, the Australians found it heavy going. It took the majority of the afternoon to reach {{the crest of the hill}} where they were to form up for the final assault. A thirty-minute pause followed, after which an artillery barrage was called down upon the Japanese defenders. On their right, 'A' Company, began to draw the Japanese fire and at 15:30 hours 'D' Company attacked the ridge, across a thin saddle. By late afternoon, the Japanese defenders had pulled back from the ridge, leaving the Australians in possession of it after heavy fighting with 'D' Company securing the main position, while 'B' Company skirted north of Barton's Knoll and secured a secondary position below the ridge, which the Australians dubbed Baker's Brow. Meanwhile, on the Australian left—the western side of the battlefield—a Juki heavy machine and snipers held up 'C' Company's advance.|$|E

Each team then added another touchdown before the Razorbacks homecoming game went final, 48–28. The Razorbacks' outstanding ground game was helped out by five Rebels turnovers, which led to 24 <b>Razorback</b> points.|$|E
