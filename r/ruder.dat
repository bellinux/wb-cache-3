5000|$|The {{eleventh}} {{match was}} a WWF Intercontinental Championship match between defending champion The Ultimate Warrior and [...] "Ravashing" [...] Rick <b>Rude</b> with Bobby Heenan in his corner. As the Warrior {{was doing his}} usual running entrance, <b>Rude</b> tried to jump start the match by attempting a knee to Warrior's stomach, {{only to find that}} the Warrior was still wearing the Intercontinental belt and hurt his knee with no effect to the champion. Warrior then shoved <b>Rude</b> into the corner 3 times from mid-ring before slapping on a bearhug. <b>Rude</b> hit a missile dropkick on Warrior and went for a cover, but Warrior no-sold and grabbed a second bearhug on <b>Rude.</b> <b>Rude</b> bit but Warrior hit him with a back body drop. He went for a Warrior Splash but <b>Rude</b> hit his knees on Warrior. <b>Rude</b> followed with a back to belly piledriver and got a near-fall on the champion. <b>Rude</b> hit a jawbreaker on Warrior and clotheslined him for a near-fall. He hit Warrior with a Russian legsweep and got another near-fall. <b>Rude</b> hooked on a surfboard but Warrior grabbed the ropes. He powered out hitting <b>Rude</b> with a running shoulder block. He delivered <b>Rude</b> a backbreaker and tried to lift him up, but dropped him clumsily in the ropes. Warrior hit <b>Rude</b> a series of Irish whips in every corner. He missed a Warrior Splash. <b>Rude</b> went for a <b>Rude</b> Awakening but Warrior powered out and clotheslined <b>Rude</b> to the apron. He tried to suplex him back into the ring, but just before he completed the move Bobby Heenan pulled Warrior's leg out from under him, which caused <b>Rude</b> to fall on top of the champion, and held onto it so the weakened Warrior could not escape as <b>Rude</b> pinned him. <b>Rude</b> won the match and became new WWF Intercontinental Champion in what was Warrior's first pinfall loss in the WWF. Following the match, an enraged Warrior chased Heenan around and into the ring and hit him with a gorilla press drop.|$|R

It's a bit much for anyone expecting the less theatrical performances of today. And yet it fits remarkably well with today's reality programming. Wolfe, after all, is <b>ruder</b> than anyone on Survivor.|$|E

25|$|With this iniquity of the Romans Salvian {{contrasts}} the chastity of the Vandals, the piety of the Goths, and the <b>ruder</b> {{virtues of}} the Franks, the Saxons, and the other tribes to whom, though heretic Arians or unbelievers, God is giving in reward the inheritance of the empire (vii. 9, II, 21). It is curious that Salvian shows no such hatred of the heterodox barbarians as was rife in Gaul seventy years later. It is difficult to credit the universal wickedness adduced by Salvian, especially in face of the contemporary testimony of Symmachus, Ausonius and Sidonius.|$|E
25|$|On 16 September 1725, <b>Ruđer</b> Bošković left Dubrovnik for Rome. He was in {{the care}} of two Jesuit priests who took him to the Society of Jesus, famous for its {{education}} of youth and at that time having some 800 establishments and 200,000 pupils under its care throughout the world. We learn nothing from Bošković himself until the time he entered the novitiate in 1731, but it was the usual practice for novices to spend the first two years not in the Collegium Romanum, but in Sant'Andrea delle Fratte. There, he studied mathematics and physics; and so brilliant was his progress in these sciences that in 1740 he was appointed professor of mathematics in the college.|$|E
5|$|The Ultimate Warrior {{gained the}} early {{advantage}} in his steel cage match with Rick <b>Rude.</b> After the Warrior missed a splash attempt, <b>Rude</b> attempted {{to win the}} match by escaping the cage. The Warrior stopped him, and both wrestlers unsuccessfully attempted to perform their finishing moves. <b>Rude</b> was then able to perform a <b>Rude</b> Awakening neckbreaker but chose to continue attacking the Warrior rather than escape the cage. <b>Rude</b> performed a shoulderblock and tried to leave through the cage door. The Warrior held him back while Bobby Heenan, <b>Rude's</b> manager, tried to pull <b>Rude</b> out. The Warrior pulled both <b>Rude</b> and Heenan into the cage. He punched Heenan and then threw {{him out of the}} cage with an atomic drop.

5000|$|At SummerSlam, Roddy Piper {{interfered}} in Rick <b>Rude's</b> WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship title {{defense against}} Ultimate Warrior and distracted <b>Rude,</b> causing <b>Rude</b> {{to lose the}} title to Warrior.

Jimmy Snuka {{became a part of}} Rowdy's Rowdies and Mr. Perfect became a part of <b>Rude</b> Brood. The Bushwhackers (Butch and Luke) feuded with The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau) in early 1989. This led to their WrestleMania V encounter where Bushwhackers won, leading to Bushwhackers joining Roddy's Rowdies and Rougeaus joining <b>Rude</b> Brood.|$|R
25|$|In WCW, <b>Rude</b> {{became a}} member of the New World Order (nWo), {{managing}} his friend Curt Hennig. Thus, <b>Rude</b> became the first wrestler to be part of both DX and nWo. When the nWo split, Hennig and <b>Rude</b> joined the nWo Wolfpac, and they tried to motivate Konnan to defeat Goldberg, who was undefeated at the time. When Konnan was defeated by Goldberg, <b>Rude</b> and Hennig attacked him, later joining nWo Hollywood, the rivals of the Wolfpac. By late 1998, both <b>Rude</b> and Hennig were off WCW television due to injuries. Hennig had an ongoing leg injury that year, and <b>Rude</b> was thought to have had testicular cancer which later turned out to be a spermatocele. Hennig returned to the nWo from his injury at Starrcade without <b>Rude,</b> who was still unable to appear. <b>Rude</b> officially left WCW in March 1999.|$|R
25|$|In {{his style}} of painting, Mr. Aikman seems to have aimed at imitating nature in her {{pleasing}} simplicity: his lights are soft, his shades mellow, and his colouring mild and harmonious. His touches have neither the force nor harshness of Rubens; nor does he seem, like Reynolds, ever to have aimed at adorning his portraits with the elegance of adventitious graces. His mind, tranquil and serene, delighted rather to wander with Thomson in the enchanting fields of Tempe, than to burst, with Michelangelo, into the <b>ruder</b> scenes of the terrible and the sublime. His compositions are distinguished by a placid tranquility and ease rather than a striking brilliancy of effect: and his portraits may be more readily mistaken for those of Kneller than any other eminent artist; {{not only because of}} the general resemblance in the dresses, which were those of the times, they being contemporaries, but also for the manner of working, and the similarity and bland mellowness of their tints.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the cities}} in the region, Varaždin and Zagreb occupy {{particularly}} prominent places in terms of culture. Varaždin is often considered the most significant centre of baroque culture and heritage in Croatia. That claim {{is reflected in the}} city's historical architecture and cultural events, based on traditions of the city from the era. Zagreb, on the other hand, is the largest cultural centre, not only in the region, but also in Croatia as a whole. It is home to dozens of galleries, museums, and theatres as well as being the site of numerous landmarks. The landmarks include the Zagreb Cathedral, founded in 1093 and rebuilt numerous times since, the last major reconstruction being after the 1880 earthquake. The cathedral is the tallest structure in Croatia. Zagreb is the most significant centre of scientific work and education in the region and the entire country. It is the site of the University of Zagreb—the oldest place of higher education in Croatia and Southeast Europe, operating continuously since 1669. It is also home to the <b>Ruđer</b> Bošković Institute—the leading Croatia's scientific research institute—and to the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.|$|E

500|$|After {{designing}} the show, {{the two had}} significant difficulties getting the series green lit. It was not picked up for fifteen years. In their final pitch to the Walt Disney Company, the creators designed a recorded storyboard, featuring a very rough outline of characters. The prototype Phineas was <b>ruder</b> to others than the version in the eventual show, where the creators decided to make him more kind. Citing comedy's [...] "big duos" [...] including Wallace and Gromit and Jay and Silent Bob, the creators chose to give Phineas most of the dialogue while Ferb remains almost silent.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{compared}} {{the film to}} those of director John Waters but felt that it fell short of the mark. Stephanie Zacharek called it a [...] "Waters knockoff" [...] while Ebert said that Waters might have been <b>ruder</b> and more polished. Babbit says that although Waters {{is one of her}} influences, she did not want her film to have the [...] "bite" [...] of his. She states that whereas John Waters does not like romantic comedies, she wanted to tell a conventionally romantic story. The production design, which was important to the overall look and feel of the film, drew mixed responses. LaSalle described it as clever and eyecatching and James Berardinelli called it a standout feature. Others found it to be gaudy, dated, cartoonish and ghastly.|$|E
500|$|So far, {{there have}} been two {{occasions}} in which no award has been presented. Bent did not offer a prize in 1987 and 1991, as he felt there was no title that was odd enough to deserve the prize. The prize has become noteworthy enough that, in 2004, The Bookseller castigated publishers for choosing titles with a view to winning it, saying, [...] "There were too many self-consciously titled entries – presumably in a bid to emulate the 2003 champion, Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories". Bent has also expressed his dislike of people voting for <b>ruder</b> titles, stating that he himself would not have voted for the 2007 winner If You Want Closure in Your Relationship, Start with Your Legs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rude</b> ways of {{speaking}} include inappropriately discouraging a person's {{participation in a}} conversation with <b>rude</b> phrases, such as [...] "" [...] or using a tone of voice that indicates disrespect for the other person.

25|$|The wrestlers {{remaining}} in the second ring continued to fight. The final four {{remaining in}} the second ring were Sting, <b>Rude,</b> Ricky Steamboat and Steve Austin. Sting attacked <b>Rude</b> as Steamboat attacked Austin. Sting sent <b>Rude</b> into Austin, and performed a Stinger splash to Austin. <b>Rude</b> accidentally eliminated Austin with a clothesline, and Steamboat eliminated <b>Rude</b> with a headscissors takedown. <b>Rude</b> then pulled Steamboat down, and Sting became the last wrestler {{remaining in the}} second ring. <b>Rude</b> returned and performed a <b>Rude</b> Awakening on Sting. Luger had the advantage over Sting with a clothesline and an inverted atomic drop. After Luger sent Sting into the guard rail, Sting fought back, sent Luger into the guard rail, and kicked him repeatedly in the midsection. Sting attempted a Stinger splash, but Luger avoided it. Sting continued to attack Luger, and performed a leg drop bulldog. Sting then eliminated Luger with a clothesline to win Battlebowl.|$|R
5|$|After {{the second}} match ended, Rick <b>Rude</b> and the Junkyard Dog {{made their way}} to the ring. Their match began as <b>Rude</b> {{attacked}} Junkyard Dog from behind, who retaliated by headbutting <b>Rude</b> several times. Subsequently, <b>Rude</b> climbed to the wrestling ring's top rope and pulled down his tights to reveal another pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl Roberts on them.
