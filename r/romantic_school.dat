Morphy's contemporaries considered him less exciting of a player than earlier giants such as Pierre La Bourdonnais and Adolf Anderssen.|$|E

500|$|Rabearivelo's first poetic work, La coupe de cendres (1924), {{demonstrates}} the evident mastery of meter and rhythm in his earliest works, despite {{an absence of}} innovation on the classic models of poetry he uses. The works that follow this initial effort can be broadly clustered into two phases, the first being highly influenced by the symbolist and <b>romantic</b> <b>schools</b> of poetry, and the second reflecting greater creativity and individuality in personal expression, and with a recurrent interest in reconciling a mental image of a [...] "mythic past" [...] with an [...] "alienating modernity".|$|R
50|$|The same incongruity marks Girodet's Danae (1799) and his Quatre Saisons, {{executed}} {{for the king}} of Spain (repeated for Compiègne), and shows itself to a ludicrous extent in his Fingal (Leuchtenberg collection, St. Petersburg), {{executed for}} Napoleon in 1802. This work unites the defects of the classic and <b>romantic</b> <b>schools,</b> for Girodet's imagination ardently and exclusively pursued the ideas excited by the varied reading of both classic and modern literature, and the impressions he received from the external world afforded him little stimulus or check; he consequently retained the mannerisms of his master's practice whilst rejecting all restraint on choice of subject.|$|R
2500|$|Antonín Dvořák {{wrote in}} 1894 that Schubert, whom he {{considered}} one of the truly great composers, was clearly influential on shorter works, especially Lieder and shorter piano works: [...] "The tendency of the <b>romantic</b> <b>school</b> has been toward short forms, and although Weber helped to show the way, to Schubert belongs the chief credit of originating the short models of piano forte pieces which the <b>romantic</b> <b>school</b> has preferably cultivated.

60|$|Taken together, Gray's works form a most {{interesting}} {{commentary on the}} varied life of the eighteenth century. He was a scholar, familiar with all the intellectual interests of his age, and his work has much of the precision and polish of the classical school; but he shares also the reawakened interest in nature, in common man, and in mediæval culture, and his work is generally romantic both in style and in spirit. The same conflict between the classic and <b>romantic</b> <b>schools,</b> and the triumph of Romanticism, is shown clearly in the most versatile of Gray's contemporaries, Oliver Goldsmith.|$|R

2500|$|Stylistically, Madetoja {{belongs to}} the {{national}} <b>Romantic</b> <b>school,</b> along with Finnish contemporaries Armas Järnefelt, Robert Kajanus, Toivo Kuula, Erkki Melartin, Selim Palmgren, and Jean Sibelius; {{with the exception of}} Okon Fuoko, Madetoja's music, darkly colored but tonal, is not particularly modernist in outlook, certainly not when compared directly with the outputs of Uuno Klami, Aarre Merikanto, Ernest Pingoud, and Väinö Raitio. For a Romantic composer, however, Madetoja's music is notably [...] "introverted", avoiding the excesses characteristic of that art movement in favor of the [...] "balance, clarity, refinement of expression, and technical polish" [...] of classicism.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the field}} of {{literature}} and aesthetics, Müller belongs to the <b>Romantic</b> <b>school.</b> He is a Romanticist even in his specialty, politics and political economy. As Eichendorff says in his Geschichte der poetischen Literatur Deutschlands (new ed., by W. Kosch, Kempten, 1906, p.352), Müller [...] "mapped out a domain of his own, the application of Romanticism to {{the social and political}} conditions of life." [...] Carl Schmitt presented the view that [...] "it is impossible to judge Müller's theory of the state as anything but a matter of aesthetics and style." [...] Müller himself declares: [...] "The reconciliation of science and art and of their noblest ideas with serious political life was the purpose of my larger works" [...] (Vermischte Schriften, I, p. iii).|$|E
2500|$|In 1824, {{he sent a}} copy of his folksong {{collection}} to Jacob Grimm, who was enthralled particularly by The Building of Skadar which Karadžić recorded from singing of Old Rashko. Grimm translated it into German and the song was noted and admired for many generations to come. Grimm compared them with the noblest flowers of Homeric poetry, and of The Building of Skadar he said: [...] "one of the most touching poems of all nations and all times." [...] The founders of the <b>Romantic</b> <b>School</b> in France, Charles Nodier, Prosper Mérimée, Lamartine, Gerard de Nerval, and Claude Fauriel translated a goodly number of them, and they also attracted the attention of Russian Alexander Pushkin, Finnish national poet Johan Ludwig Runeberg, Czech Samuel Roznay, Pole Kazimierz Brodzinski, English writers Walter Scott, Owen Meredith, and John Bowring, among others.|$|E
2500|$|The art {{historian}} Jean Clay said Ingres [...] "proceeded always from certitude to certitude, {{with the result}} that even his freest sketches reveal the same kind of execution as that found in the final works." [...] Abhorring the visible brushstroke, Ingres made no recourse to the shifting effects of colour and light on which the <b>Romantic</b> <b>school</b> depended; he preferred local colours only faintly modelled in light by half tones. [...] "Ce que l'on sait," [...] he would repeat, [...] "il faut le savoir l'épée à la main." [...] ("Whatever you know, you must know it with sword in hand.") Ingres thus left himself without the means of producing the necessary unity of effect when dealing with crowded compositions, such as the Apotheosis of Homer and the Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian. Among Ingres's historical and mythological paintings, the most satisfactory are usually those depicting one or two figures, such as Oedipus, The Half-Length Bather, Odalisque, and The Spring, subjects only animated by the consciousness of perfect physical well-being.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, momentous changes {{were taking place}} in Telugu art and literature. A number of young writers and artists openly came out with their {{solidarity}} to the fighting masses. All the existing literary establishments were questioned. Rebellion shook the foundations of traditional, vague humanistic and <b>romantic</b> <b>schools</b> of literature. Some illustrious figures like Sri Sri and Kutumba Rao from older generation joined hands with the young blood {{in the cause of}} the people. Under the influence of the three-year-old people's armed struggle in Srikakulam, a year-long effort in the literary field brought Viplava Rachayitala Sangham (Revolutionary Writer's Association) into existence.

2500|$|Although Keats {{wrote that}} [...] "if poetry comes not as {{naturally}} as the Leaves {{to a tree}} it had better not come at all", poetry did not come easily to him; his work was the fruit of a deliberate and prolonged classical self-education. He may have possessed an innate poetic sensibility, but his early works were clearly those {{of a young man}} learning his craft. His first attempts at verse were often vague, languorously narcotic and lacking a clear eye. His poetic sense was based on the conventional tastes of his friend Charles Cowden Clarke, who first introduced him to the classics, and also came from the predilections of Hunt's Examiner, which Keats read as a boy. Hunt scorned the Augustan or 'French' school, dominated by Pope, and attacked the earlier Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, now in their forties, as unsophisticated, obscure and crude writers. Indeed, during Keats's few years as a published poet, the reputation of the older <b>Romantic</b> <b>school</b> was at its lowest ebb. Keats came to echo these sentiments in his work, identifying himself with a 'new school' for a time, somewhat alienating him from Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron and providing the basis from the scathing attacks from Blackwoods and The Quarterly.|$|E
