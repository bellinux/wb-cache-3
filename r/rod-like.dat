5|$|As {{we already}} saw above, the nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{are composed of}} <b>rod-like</b> molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector n called the director, is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules {{in the neighborhood of}} any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.|$|E
5|$|The objects {{created by}} amphiphiles are usually spherical (as {{in the case}} of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), <b>rod-like,</b> or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These {{anisotropic}} self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves {{in much the same way}} as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single <b>rod-like</b> unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{suggest that it}} may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also seems to have been greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is <b>rod-like</b> in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a sensitive middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Frogs and {{all other}} living {{tetrapods}} have a <b>rod-like</b> bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum —or homologous tympanum— to the inner ear. Temnospondyls also have a stapes, which projects into the otic cavity. The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe-finned fishes. The positioning of the stapes and {{the shape of the}} otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these amphibians are no longer considered homologous with the hearing systems of reptiles, birds, and mammals. Therefore, ear structures in temnospondyls were not ancestral to those of all other tetrapods.|$|E
5|$|Like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, {{and other}} styracosternans, Eolambia has {{cervical}} vertebrae {{which are very}} opisthocoelous, meaning that their front ends are strongly convex while their back ends are strongly concave. Unusually, {{the front end of}} the third cervical is set slightly higher than the back end, which is not seen in any other cervical vertebrae. Vertebrae from further back in the neck have a greater angle between the elongate articular processes known as the postzygapophyses, and also more elongate transverse processes. On the transverse processes, there are further articular processes – the rounded parapophyses and <b>rod-like</b> diapophyses – are located. In the rearmost cervicals, there is also a deep depression separating the postzygapophyses, and the neural spines have steeply-angled front margins, which has the effect of creating prominent spike-like projections.|$|E
5|$|The arms of I. bernissartensis {{were long}} (up to 75% {{the length of}} the legs) and robust, with rather {{inflexible}} hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main digits. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal's nose. Later fossils revealed {{the true nature of the}} thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. They could have been used for defense, or for foraging for food. The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons, which were tendons that turned to bone during life (these <b>rod-like</b> bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings).|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} of a stony coral in the order Scleractinia is secreted by the epidermis of {{the lower part of}} the polyp; this forms a corallite, a cup-shaped hollow made of calcium carbonate, in which the polyp sits. In colonial corals, following growth of the polyp by budding, new corallites are formed, with the surface of the skeleton being covered by a layer of coenosarc. These colonies adopt a range of massive, branching, leaf-like and encrusting forms. Soft corals in the subclass Octocorallia are also colonial and have a skeleton formed of mesogloeal tissue, often reinforced with calcareous spicules or horny material, and some have <b>rod-like</b> supports internally. Other anthozoans, such as sea anemones, are naked; these rely on a hydrostatic skeleton for support. Some of these species have a sticky epidermis to which sand grains and shell fragments adhere, and zoanthids incorporate these substances into their mesogloea.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with <b>rod-like</b> structures, and {{degenerated}} nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E
5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a <b>rod-like,</b> single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{is placed}} under guard in quarters. McGivers {{is sent to}} brief him on current events. Taking {{advantage}} of McGivers' attraction towards him, Khan tells her he means to rule mankind again and needs her help to take over Enterprise. Reluctantly, she agrees, beaming Khan to Botany Bay, where he revives {{the rest of his}} people. They return to Enterprise and assume control of the ship. Khan throws Kirk into a decompression tank, and threatens to slowly suffocate him unless Kirk's command crew agree to follow Khan. Having a change of heart, McGivers frees Kirk from the chamber. Kirk and Spock vent anesthetic gas throughout the entire ship to disable Khan and his cohorts. Khan escapes the gas and heads to Engineering, where he attempts to destroy Enterprise, but Kirk confronts him and a brawl ensues. Though outmatched by Khan's superior strength, Kirk pulls an odd <b>rod-like</b> tool (never seen before or since, in this episode or the entire series) from a wall and uses it as a club to knock the superman unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Azobenzene {{molecules}} can {{be incorporated}} into polymer matrices as stabilizers. It is also {{interesting to note that the}} rigid <b>rod-like</b> structure of azo molecules allows them to behave as liquid-crystal mesogens in many materials.|$|E
25|$|Since {{fibrinogen}} is a <b>rod-like</b> protein with nodules {{on either}} end capable of binding GPIIb/IIIa, activated platelets with exposed GPIIb/IIIa can bind fibrinogen to aggregate. GPIIb/IIIa may also further anchor the platelets to subendothelial vWF for additional clot structural stabilisation.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1900s, yogurt was {{a staple}} in diets {{of people in the}} Russian Empire (and {{especially}} Central Asia and the Caucasus), Western Asia, South Eastern Europe/Balkans, Central Europe, and India. Stamen Grigorov (1878–1945), a Bulgarian student of medicine in Geneva, first examined the microflora of the Bulgarian yogurt. In 1905, he described it as consisting of a spherical and a <b>rod-like</b> lactic acid-producing bacteria. In 1907, the <b>rod-like</b> bacterium was called Bacillus bulgaricus (now Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). The Russian Nobel laureate and biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov, from the Institut Pasteur in Paris, was influenced by Grigorov's work and hypothesized that regular consumption of yogurt was responsible for the unusually long lifespans of Bulgarian peasants. Believing Lactobacillus to be essential for good health, Mechnikov worked to popularize yogurt as a foodstuff throughout Europe.|$|E
25|$|In acetylene, the H–C≡C bond angles are 180°. By {{virtue of}} this bond angle, alkynes are <b>rod-like.</b> Correspondingly, cyclic alkynes are rare. Benzyne is highly unstable. The C≡C bond {{distance}} of 121 picometers is much {{shorter than the}} C=C distance in alkenes (134pm) or the C–C bond in alkanes (153pm).|$|E
25|$|The neck of Postosuchus {{consists}} {{of at least}} eight cervical vertebrae followed by sixteen dorsals, while four co-ossified sacral vertebrae supported the hips. It {{is thought to be}} over thirty vertebrae in the tail decreasing in size to the end. The pelvis with the hooked pubis and the <b>rod-like</b> ischium looked like those of carnosaur dinosaurs. The ribcage of Postosuchus had typical archosaur structure, composed of large and slender, curved ribs. In some discoveries ribs were found associated with gastralia, dermal bones located in the ventral region of the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the {{electrodes}} is the key part: These are <b>rod-like</b> structures usually made of glass, with a bulb containing the sensor at the bottom. The glass electrode for measuring the pH has a glass bulb specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration. On immersion in the solution to be tested, hydrogen ions in the test solution exchange for other positively charged ions on the glass bulb, creating an electrochemical potential across the bulb. The electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to pH units. The magnitude of the electrochemical potential across the glass bulb is linearly related to the pH according to the Nernst equation.|$|E
25|$|Different populations within Cape Dwarf Chameleons {{were found}} to have {{different}} preferences regarding Perch Diameter. The two main populations, Kogelberg and Stellenbosch, were seen to have different behavior. Kogelberg tended to use perches that were significantly wider on average than perches used by the Stellenbosch site which chose perches by random. Hand size has a direct correlation with grip strength on both broad and narrow dowels, <b>rod-like</b> structures, in both populations. The longer the tail length, the greater the strength. This species prefers to sleep on perches of specific diameters that correspond to their specific morphology. Animals from habitats characterized by wider perches are also stronger than their counterparts living in habitats with narrow branches. This has led to sexual selection for chameleons with specific traits like hand size and tail length.|$|E
25|$|Digestive system: The {{mouth is}} a minute {{transverse}} slit {{in the front}} of the cephalic disc. The jawss are large, but imperfectly cornified. The jaws are angular and minutely, irregularly serrate. They are composed of numerous minute prismatic rods. On the margin many of these rods are transverse and project slightly, forming a minute serration. The radular sack is small. The radula has the formula 12.1.1.1.12. The central tooth is a simple flat triangular plate. The single lateral tooth is well differentiated from the marginal teeth, from which it is separated by a considerable space, and points in the opposite direction. The marginal teeth are slender, elongate, curved <b>rod-like</b> bodies somewhat expanded at the base. They decrease in size gradually from the second or third marginal, which is slightly larger than the first, outwards.|$|E
25|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (C12H25NaO4S; mW: 288.38) (only used in {{denaturing}} protein gels) is {{a strong}} detergent agent used to denature native proteins to individual polypeptides. This denaturation, which {{is referred to as}} reconstructive denaturation, is not accomplished by the total linearization of the protein, but instead, through a conformational change to a combination of random coil and α helix secondary structures. When a protein mixture is heated to 100°C in presence of SDS, the detergent wraps around the polypeptide backbone. It binds to polypeptides in a constant weight ratio of 1.4 g SDS/g of polypeptide. In this process, the intrinsic charges of polypeptides become negligible when compared to the negative charges contributed by SDS. Thus polypeptides after treatment become <b>rod-like</b> structures possessing a uniform charge density, that is same net negative charge per unit weight. The electrophoretic mobilities of these proteins is a linear function of the logarithms of their molecular weights. Without SDS, different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in mass-charge ratio, as each protein has an isoelectric point and molecular weight particular to its primary structure. This is known as native PAGE. Adding SDS solves this problem, as it binds to and unfolds the protein, giving a near uniform negative charge {{along the length of the}} polypeptide.|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{crystals}} made of <b>rod-like</b> molecules {{had been}} discovered in 1888, and many compounds had been synthesized at Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany in the 1920s and 30s. Some physical studies had been undertaken by the German and Russian schools during that era, but the subject later languished till the mid-fifties. Starting in the late fifties, the systematic synthetic effort by George William Gray in the UK and the physical studies by Wilhelm Maier in Germany (including the well-known Maier–Saupe or MS theory) started {{a revival of the}} subject. Chandrasekhar and his co-workers made contributions to the application of the dynamical theory of reflections to study the fascinating optical properties of cholesteric liquid crystals which have a helical structure with a pitch which is usually ~ 0.5mm, and to the extensions of the molecular theory of nematic liquid crystals beyond the MS model. Chandrasekhar was invited to establish a liquid crystal laboratory in RRI after the Department of Science and Technology started supporting it in 1971. The move had a highly positive impact on his productivity. Along with a couple of former students who moved with him to RRI, in a short time, he developed a laboratory with all the essential facilities needed for research in the chosen area. Realizing that cutting-edge research would not be possible without an in-house capacity to produce new materials, a synthetic organic chemistry laboratory was set up. Soon many new experimental and a few theoretical results emerged and the Liquid Crystal Laboratory at RRI became one of the leading centres of research in the world. The twisted nematic liquid crystal display was invented in Europe in 1971 and recently, LCDs have displaced CRTs as commercially the most important displays. In cooperation with Chandrasekhar and his colleagues, the Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Bangalore, developed indigenous know-how for the manufacture of simple LCDs for the domestic market.|$|E
500|$|Caenorhabditis elegans (...) is a {{free-living}} (not parasitic), transparent nematode (roundworm), about 1mm in length, {{that lives}} in temperate soil environments. The name {{is a blend of}} the Greek caeno- (recent), rhabditis (<b>rod-like)</b> and Latin elegans (elegant). In 1900, Maupas initially named it Rhabditides elegans, Osche placed it in the subgenus Caenorhabditis in 1952, and in 1955, Dougherty raised it to the status of genus.|$|E
500|$|Thescelosaurus was {{a heavily}} built bipedal animal, {{probably}} herbivorous, but potentially not. There {{was a prominent}} ridge {{along the length of}} both maxillae (the tooth-bearing [...] "cheek" [...] bones), and a ridge on both dentaries (tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw). The ridges and position of the teeth, deeply internal to the outside surface of the skull, are interpreted as evidence for muscular cheeks. Aside from the long narrow beak, the skull also had teeth in the premaxilla, or upper beak (a primitive trait among ornithopods). Long <b>rod-like</b> bones called palpebrals were present over the eyes, giving the animal heavy bony eyebrows. Its teeth were of two types: small pointed premaxillary teeth, and leaf-shaped cheek teeth. Six small teeth were present in both premaxillae, with a toothless section {{at the tip of the}} beak.|$|E
500|$|The art {{style for}} the game {{was based on the}} work of Frank Frazetta and {{inspired}} by heavy metal and rock album covers. The team only considered the addition of elements to the artwork if they felt it would be something that could be seen on such covers. The setting includes hot <b>rod-like</b> engines that grow from the earth like a [...] "V8 Truffle Of Speed", with design inspired by the designs of Ed [...] "Big Daddy" [...] Roth. The art team wanted to avoid creating [...] "another brown-gray game", and strove to use the wide color palettes that are associated with heavy metal art. Cutscenes in the game use the game's engine, though some pre-recorded scenes from the engine have also been prepared with the help of Tasha Harris, a former Pixar employee who helped to animate character's faces during cutscenes.|$|E
500|$|Limusaurus was a small, slender {{animal with}} a long neck and legs (the latter being 1.8 times {{the length of the}} torso), {{measuring}} about [...] in length and [...] in weight. It had a short skull, which was roughly half the length of the femur. A beak covered the slightly convex premaxilla {{at the tip of the}} jaw, a feature that was not known in any non-coelurosaurian theropods until the discovery of Limusaurus. The opening, or fenestra, of the mandible was quite large, being 40% the length of the entire lower jaw. The eye socket was also quite large. Other bones with distinctive morphologies in the skull of Limusaurus are the nasal bones, which were ridged on each side, and were short and wide relative to the entire skull; the lacrimal bones, which sloped downwards sharply over the eyes; and the jugal bones, the branches of which were slender and <b>rod-like.</b>|$|E
500|$|Dromaeosaurids {{had long}} tails. Most {{of the tail}} {{vertebrae}} bear bony, <b>rod-like</b> extensions, as well as bony tendons in some species. In his study of Deinonychus, Ostrom proposed that these features stiffened the tail {{so that it could}} only flex at the base, and the whole tail would then move as a single, rigid, lever. However, one well-preserved specimen of Velociraptor mongoliensis (IGM 100/986) has an articulated tail skeleton that is curved horizontally in a long S-shape. This suggests that, in life, the tail could bend from side to side with a substantial degree of flexibility. It has been proposed that this tail was used as a stabilizer or counterweight while running or in the air; in Microraptor, an elongate diamond-shaped fan of feathers is preserved {{on the end of the}} tail. This may have been used as an aerodynamic stabilizer and rudder during gliding or powered flight (see [...] "Flight and gliding" [...] below).|$|E
500|$|ATP synthase is {{a massive}} protein complex with a mushroom-like shape. The {{mammalian}} enzyme complex contains 16 subunits and has a mass of approximately 600 kilodaltons. The portion embedded within the membrane is called FO and contains a ring of c subunits and the proton channel. The stalk and the ball-shaped headpiece is called F1 and {{is the site of}} ATP synthesis. The ball-shaped complex {{at the end of the}} F1 portion contains six proteins of two different kinds (three α subunits and three β subunits), whereas the [...] "stalk" [...] consists of one protein: the γ subunit, with the tip of the stalk extending into the ball of α and β subunits. Both the α and β subunits bind nucleotides, but only the β subunits catalyze the ATP synthesis reaction. Reaching along the side of the F1 portion and back into the membrane is a long <b>rod-like</b> subunit that anchors the α and β subunits into the base of the enzyme.|$|E
500|$|At hatching, {{a typical}} {{salamander}} larva has eyes without lids, teeth in both {{upper and lower}} jaws, three pairs of feathery external gills, a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins. The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond-living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water. Pond-type larvae often have a pair of balancers, <b>rod-like</b> structures {{on either side of}} the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment. Some members of the genera Ambystoma and Dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form, but this varies with species and with populations. The northwestern salamander (Ambystoma gracile) is one of these and, depending on environmental factors, either remains permanently in the larval state, a condition known as neoteny, or transforms into an adult. Both of these are able to breed. Neoteny occurs when the animal's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine. Other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food, lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics. The tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process. The adult tiger salamander is terrestrial, but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state. When conditions are particularly inhospitable on land, larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out. There are fifteen species of [...] neotenic salamanders, including species of Necturus, Proteus and Amphiuma, and many examples of [...] ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances.|$|E
500|$|The spores of M.nargan {{are roughly}} ellipsoid, smooth, hyaline, and measure 7.4–10.4 by 4.8–7.1μm. They have a small, oblique , and lack oil droplets. In terms of {{staining}} reactions, they are [...] (not absorbing methyl blue dye), and amyloid (turning [...] blue-black in Melzer's reagent). The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are club-shaped, have clamp connections at their bases, and measure 29.6–36.4 by 8.2–10.7μm. They are four-spored, and the spores {{are attached to the}} basidia by long slender sterigmata that are up to 7.2μm long. The gill edge is sterile (without basidia), and has adundant cystidia. These thin-walled cheilocystidia range in shape from swollen in the middle with a beak-like point, to spindle-shaped (...) to club-shaped. They are smooth, hyaline, and inamyloid, with dimensions of 20.8–38.4 by 4.8–10.4μm. They have a clamp connection at base. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not present in this species. The gill tissue is made of smooth, thin-walled cylindrical to egg-shaped cells, up to 30.4μm in diameter. The cells are dextrinoid (producing a black to blue-black positive reaction with Melzer's reagent), and reddish brown. The surface of the cap (the pileipellis) is made of a layer of bent-over filamentous hyphae measuring 1.8–4.8μm. These loosely arranged hyphae are slightly gelatinised, smooth, thin-walled, hyaline, inamyloid, and have clamp connections. The tissue layer directly under the pileipellis (the hypodermium) has cells containing brown pigment. The cap tissue consists of smooth, thin-walled, cylindrical to broadly cylindrical or ovoid cells, up to 37.0μm in diameter, with clamp connections. These cells are dextrinoid and reddish orange-brown in colour. The surface of the stem is made of filamentous hyphae, 2.2–4.0μm in diameter, either smooth or with sparse to moderately dense short, <b>rod-like</b> to cylindrical projections. The cells are thin-walled to very slightly thick-walled, hyaline, inamyloid, and have clamp connections. Caulocystidia (cystidia on the cap surface) are not present. The stem tissue consists of short, cylindrical cells, up to 28.0μm in diameter that are smooth, thin-walled, and with or without brown pigment in the cytoplasm. The cells contain clamp connections and are reddish orange-brown.|$|E

2500|$|Juvenile onset {{dystonia}} {{is a rare}} {{degenerative disease}} that affects the central nervous system; in particular, it affects areas of the neocortex and thalamus, where <b>rod-like</b> eosinophilic inclusions are formed. The affected individuals represent a phenotype with deformities on the median line, sensory hearing loss and dystonia. It {{is caused by a}} point mutation in which the amino acid tryptophan replaces arginine in position 183. [...] This alters actin’s interaction with the ADF/cofilin system, which regulates the dynamics of nerve cell cytoskeleton formation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulty}} {{in determining the}} exact structure of Nafion stems from inconsistent solubility and crystalline structure among its various derivatives. [...] Advanced morphological models have included a core-shell model where the ion-rich core is surrounded by an ion poor shell, a rod model where the sulfonic groups arrange into crystal-like rods, and a sandwich model where the polymer forms two layers whose sulfonic groups attract across an aqueous layer where transport occurs. [...] Consistency between the models include a network of ionic clusters; the models differ in the cluster geometry and distribution. [...] Although no model has yet been determined fully correct, some scientists have demonstrated that as the membrane hydrates, Nafion's morphology transforms from the Cluster-Channel model to a <b>rod-like</b> model.|$|E
2500|$|Nutritional {{stress can}} change {{bacterial}} morphology. [...] A common shape alteration is filamentation {{which can be}} triggered by a limited availability {{of one or more}} substrates, nutrients or electron acceptors. Since the filament can increase a cell’s uptake–surface area without significantly changing its volume appreciably. [...] Moreover, the filamentation benefits bacterial cells attaching to a surface because it increases specific surface area in direct contact with the solid medium. In addition, the filamentation may allows bacterial cells to access nutrients by enhancing the possibility that part of the filament will contact a nutrient-rich zone and pass compounds {{to the rest of the}} cell’s biomass. For example, Actinomyces israelii grows as filamentous rods or branched in the absence of phosphate, cysteine, or glutathione. However, it returns to a regular <b>rod-like</b> morphology when adding back these nutrients.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of the SDS-PAGE application, the {{compound}} works by disrupting non-covalent bonds in the proteins, and so denaturing them, i.e., causing the protein molecules to lose their native conformations and shapes. By binding to the proteins with high affinity and in high concentrations, the negatively charged detergent provides all proteins with a similar net negative charge and therefore a similar charge-to-mass ratio. In this way, the difference in mobility of the polypeptide chains in the gel can be attributed solely to their size as opposed to both their size and charge. [...] It is possible to make separation based {{on the size of the}} polypeptide chain to simplify the analysis of protein molecules, this can be achieved by denaturing proteins with the detergent SDS. The association of SDS molecules with protein molecules imparts an associated negative charge to the molecular aggregate formed; this negative charge is significantly greater than the original charge of that protein. The electrostatic repulsion that is created by SDS binding forces proteins into a <b>rod-like</b> shape, thereby eliminating differences in shape as a factor for electrophoretic separation in gels.Dodecyl sulfate molecule has two negative charges at the pH value used for electrophoresis, this will lead the net charge of coated polypeptide chains to be much more negative than uncoated chains. The charge-to-mass ratio is essentially identical for different proteins because SDS coating dominates the charge.|$|E
