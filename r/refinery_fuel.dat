40|$|In {{order to}} meet DOE's goals of {{developing}} low-emissions coal-based power systems, PCI has further developed and adapted it's Rich-Catalytic Lean-burn (RCL{reg_sign}) catalytic reactor to a combustion system operating on syngas as a fuel. The technology offers ultra-low emissions without the cost of exhaust after-treatment, with high efficiency (avoidance of after-treatment losses and reduced diluent requirements), and with catalytically stabilized combustion which extends the lower Btu limit for syngas operation. Tests were performed in PCI's sub-scale high-pressure (10 atm) test rig, using a two-stage (catalytic then gas-phase) combustion process for syngas fuel. In this process, the first stage consists of a fuel-rich mixture reacting on a catalyst with final and excess combustion air used to cool the catalyst. The second stage is a gas-phase combustor, where the air used for cooling the catalyst mixes with the catalytic reactor effluent to provide for final gas-phase burnout and dilution to fuel-lean combustion products. During testing, operating with a simulated Tampa Electric's Polk Power Station syngas, the NOx emissions program goal of less than 0. 03 lbs/MMBtu (6 ppm at 15 % O{sub 2 }) was met. NOx emissions were generally near 0. 01 lbs/MMBtu (2 ppm at 15 % O{sub 2 }) (PCI's target) over a range on engine firing temperatures. In addition, low emissions were shown for alternative fuels including high hydrogen content <b>refinery</b> <b>fuel</b> gas and low BTU content Blast Furnace Gas (BFG). For the <b>refinery</b> <b>fuel</b> gas increased resistance to combustor flashback was achieved through preferential consumption of hydrogen in the catalytic bed. In the case of BFG, stable combustion for fuels as low as 88 BTU/ft{sup 3 } was established and maintained {{without the need for}} using co-firing. This was achieved based on the upstream catalytic reaction delivering a hotter (and thus more reactive) product to the flame zone. The PCI catalytic reactor was also shown to be active in ammonia reduction in fuel allowing potential reductions in the burner NOx production. These reductions of NOx emissions and expanded alternative fuel capability make the rich catalytic combustor uniquely situated to provide reductions in capital costs through elimination of requirements for SCR, operating costs through reduction in need for NOx abating dilution, SCR operating costs, and need for co-firing fuels allowing use of lower value but more available fuels, and efficiency of an engine through reduction in dilution flows...|$|E

As a result, researching options for alternative components or alternative processes are very important to continuously improve the octane number in the fuel pool. Therefore, by exploiting the high olefin (butene, hexene and octene) content part of the feedstocks, the overall aim {{of this study was to}} obtain olefin skeletal isomerization for the improvement of the RON in the <b>refinery</b> <b>fuel</b> pool. The influence of temperature variation (350 °C, 400 °C and 450 °C) on the performance of the different alumina catalysts (eta (η) -alumina, H-ZSM- 5 and silicated alumina) was investigated. All experiments were performed using a fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure and a constant weight hourly space velocity of 5 h- 1. The effect of the different conditions and additions on conversion and selectivity was determined. Eta alumina and the silicated alumina (Siralox 40) were proved to be the catalysts that were most prone to cause skeletal isomerization when in contact with longer carbon chains. Butene did not isomerize to a significant extent when contacted over either Eta alumina or Siralox 40. In the case of the zeolite catalyst (ZSM- 5), none of the feeds isomerized and it was speculated that it could have been due to the high activity of ZSM- 5 which made this catalyst more likely to cause side reactions rather than the preferred skeletal isomerization reaction.

40|$|In {{order to}} compare the {{environmental}} damage of vehicles, rating systems are analyzed as to allow decision makers to dedicate their financial and non-financial policies and measures in function of the ecological damage. Different types of pollutions (acid rain, photochemical air pollution, noise pollution and global warming, etc.) and their effect on numerous receptors such as ecosystems, buildings and human beings (e. g. : cancer, respiratory diseases, etc) are investigated. The methodology described, know as Ecoscore, {{is based on a}} methodology similar to a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) which considers the part played by emissions in certain types of damage (e. g. by using the Exposure-Response damage function). Total emissions involve oil extraction, transport and <b>refinery,</b> <b>fuel</b> distribution and electricity generation and distribution, (Well-to-Wheel approach).

40|$|A DOE/PETC funded {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the use of a liquid phase mixed alcohol synthesis (LPMAS) plant to produce gasoline blending ethers. The LPMAS plant was integrated into three utilization scenarios: a coal fed IGCC power plant, a petroleum refinery using coke as a gasification feedstock, and a standalone natural gas fed partial oxidation plant. The objective {{of the study was to}} establish targets for the development of catalysts for the LPMAS reaction. In the IGCC scenario, syngas conversions need only be moderate because unconverted syngas is utilized by the combined cycle system. A once through LPMAS plant achieving syngas conversions in the range of 38 [...] 49 % was found to be suitable. At a gas hourly space velocity of 5, 000 sL/Kg-hr and a methanol:isobutanol selectivity ratio of 1. 03, the target catalyst productivity ranges from 370 to 460 g iBuOH/Kg-hr. In the petroleum refinery scenario, high conversions ({approximately} 95 %) are required to avoid overloading the <b>refinery</b> <b>fuel</b> system with low Btu content unconverted syngas. To achieve these high conversions with the low H{sub 2 }/CO ratio syngas, a recycle system was required (because of the limit imposed by methanol equilibrium), steam was injected into the LPMAS reactor, and CO{sub 2 } was removed from the recycle loop. At the most economical recycle ratio, the target catalyst productivity is 265 g iBuOH/Kg-hr. In the standalone LPMAS scenario, essentially complete conversions are required to achieve a fuel balanced plant. At the most economical recycle ratio, the target catalyst productivity is 285 g iBuOH/Kg-hr. The economics of this scenario are highly dependent on the cost of the natural gas feedstock and the location of the plant. For all three case scenarios, the economics of a LPMAS plant is marginal at current ether market prices.

40|$|International audiencetHydrocarbon {{pyrolysis}} concerns {{many different}} fields (petroleum geochemistry, <b>refinery,</b> <b>fuel</b> thermalstability, pyrocarbon deposition, etc.). It is therefore studied {{in a wide}} variety of temperature–pressureexperimental conditions, which strongly affect the chemistry of hydrocarbons cracking. An experimental study of the pyrolysis of n-octane has been performed at very low reactant concen-tration (1 mbar diluted in inert gas − total pressure 1500 mbar − molar fraction 0. 07 %) in a closed reactor,at temperatures ranging between 350 ◦C and 450 ◦C, and reaction time from 1 h to 70 h. The major prod-ucts of the reaction are 1 -alkenes (C 2 H 4 to C 7 H 14), methane and ethane; other alkanes (C 3 H 8 to C 6 H 14) are minor products. At 450 ◦C and 4 h, the conversion is close to 9 % and we observe, in terms of molarfractions:C 2 H 4 > C 3 H 6 ≈ CH 4 > C 4 H 8 > C 5 H 10 > C 6 H 12 ≈ C 2 H 6 > C 7 H 14 These experimental results are very different from those of the thermal decomposition of n-alkanesat the same low temperature but at high pressure. In particular, the cracking stoichiometric equations(for example: C 8 H 18 = C 6 H 14 + C 2 H 4) are not observed since alkanes (except methane and ethane) are invery low quantities. This can be explained by the very low concentration of reactant which limits thebimolecular reactions. In our conditions, the radicals decompose several times by beta-scissions of CCbonds when it is possible (unimolecular reaction), rather than react by H-transfers (metathesis) with thereactant (bimolecular reaction) which produce alkanes.

Even if 50 percent of the coke produced is exported, {{there will be an}} excess capacity of coke selling at less than $ 30 /ton depending upon the sulfur content. This coke can be gasified effectively to produce medium-Btu (300 Btu/scf) gas which, in turn, can fuel the refinery furnaces to replace natural gas. Coke gasification should prove economical with natural gas price decontrol and the average price projected to rise to over $ 14. 0 per million Btu in 1990. The paper will discuss three gasifiers - Gesellschaft fur Kohle-Technologie Gmbh (GKT), Texaco and Westinghouse which may be used for the production of medium-Btu gas from coke.

40|$|AbstractPre-combustion CO 2 Capture {{applied to}} {{industrial}} sources {{is an alternative}} for achieving low CO 2 emissions at a moderate cost. The potential of the technology {{to be used as}} retrofit would further expand its possibilities and could be a real benefit to the industry in terms of achieving CO 2 emission reduction at relatively low cost. The retrofitting of a boiler to hydrogen fuel bears some difficulties due the significant differences in gas and combustion properties between hydrogen and gaseous hydrocarbon fuels. The present investigations by CFD simulations revealed that the effect on the overall performance of the fired heater when the fuel is switched to hydrogen is likely to be minimal. The simulations also showed that the NOx-emissions with pure hydrogen fuel is in fact lower than with the <b>refinery</b> <b>fuel</b> gas on mass basis, or similar on ppm basis. This is due to the rather large contribution from the prompt-NO mechanism that obviously is absent in the hydrogen case. Similarly, the effect of switching fuel from methane to hydrogen was investigated experimentally on a lab scale model low NOx burner. The burner, first characterized for methane in terms of emissions and stability, was operated with hydrogen without modification and then by applying a first development modification. The later version of the burner allowed first to solve an overheating issue recognized when in the direct switch configuration. Furthermore, the NOx performance revealed to be even better than with methane as fuel, which contradicts most of the previous studies found on this topic, but confirms the CFD analysis of the full refinery heater simulation. Energetic requirements for post-combustion capture using MEA as solvent, an auto-thermal reformal based pre-combustion scheme with aMDEA as solvent and steam methane reformer with pre- and post-combustion capture using MEA and aMDEA were evaluated. Post-combustion capture has the least energy requirements followed by auto-thermal reformer based pre-combustion route.
