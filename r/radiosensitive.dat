25|$|Differences in {{response}} to treatment between HPV-OPC and HPV+OPC may include differences in the extent and manner in which cellular growth-regulatory pathways are altered in the two forms of OPC. For instance in HPV+OPC the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes merely render the p53 and pRb pathways dormant, leaving open the possibility of reactivation of these pathways by down-regulating (reducing) expression of the oncogenes. This {{is in contrast to}} the mutant form of p53 found in HPV-OPC that is associated with treatment resistance. Furthermore, it is suggested that the effects of E6 and E7 on these pathways renders the tumour more <b>radiosensitive,</b> possibly by interference with mechanisms such as DNA repair, repopulation signalling, and cell-cycle redistribution. The microenvironment is also important, with radiation increasing host immune response to viral antigens expressed on the tumour. Also, there is an association between an increase in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and in circulating white blood cells in HPV+OPC patients and better prognosis. This implies a role for an adaptive immune system in suppressing tumour progression.|$|E

50|$|Inhibition {{or loss of}} MDC1 protein through {{studies with}} siRNA on human cells or {{knockout}} studies in mice have shown several defects at both the cellular and organismal level.

Knock out MDC1 mice cells and silenced human cells were <b>radiosensitive,</b> failed to initiate Intra-S phase and G2/M checkpoints, failed to produce ionizing radiation-induced foci had poor phosphorylation by the DRR kinases (ATM, CHK1, CHK2), defects in homologous recombination.

50|$|The {{response}} of a cancer to radiation {{is described by}} its radiosensitivity.Highly <b>radiosensitive</b> cancer cells are rapidly killed by modest doses of radiation. These include leukemias, most lymphomas and germ cell tumors.The majority of epithelial cancers are only moderately <b>radiosensitive,</b> and require a significantly higher dose of radiation (60-70 Gy) to achieve a radical cure.Some types of cancer are notably radioresistant, that is, much higher doses are required to produce a radical cure than may be safe in clinical practice. Renal cell cancer and melanoma are {{generally considered to be}} radioresistant but radiation therapy is still a palliative option for many patients with metastatic melanoma. Combining radiation therapy with immunotherapy is an active area of investigation and has shown some promise for melanoma and other cancers.|$|E
50|$|Radiation is used {{to control}} or cure cancers provided: the tumor {{targeted}} falls in the range suitable for radiation, no <b>radiosensitive</b> organs are involved, {{and it can be}} meta-sized. It can be done either internally through implants (branchytherapy), or externally by using radioactive beams (teleotherapy). This destroys the DNA of the cells and ensures reproduction chances are diminished.|$|E

50|$|Radiotherapy is {{the main}} choice of {{treatment}} for both SPB and extramedullary plasmacytoma, and local control rates of >80% can be achieved.

Surgery is an option for extramedullary plasmacytoma, but for cosmetic reasons it is generally used when the lesion is not present within the head and neck region.|$|E
50|$|The {{differences}} in risk are even greater when considering organ-specific cancers, especially given that both reports identify breast, ovarian, lung, colon, and thyroid tissues {{as the most}} <b>radiosensitive</b> among women. For example, the FGR 13 has estimated that the ratio of thyroid cancer incidence for women as compared to men is 2.14, while the findings of BEIR VII suggest that women are even more vulnerable to radiation-induced thyroid cancer {{at a ratio of}} 4.76.|$|E
50|$|A {{different}} approach to CRC is to inhibit CD47—a membrane protein that is the thrombospondin-1 receptor. Loss of CD47 permits sustained proliferation of primary murine endothelial cells, increases asymmetric division and enables these cells to spontaneously reprogram to form multipotent embryoid body-like clusters. CD47 knockdown acutely increases mRNA levels of c-Myc and other stem cell transcription factors in cells in vitro and in vivo. Thrombospondin-1 is a key environmental signal that inhibits stem cell self-renewal via CD47. Thus, CD47 antagonists enable cell self-renewal and reprogramming by overcoming negative regulation of c-Myc and other stem cell transcription factors. In vivo blockade of CD47 using an antisense morpholino increases survival of mice exposed to lethal total body irradiation due to increased proliferative capacity of bone marrow-derived cells and radioprotection of <b>radiosensitive</b> gastrointestinal tissues.|$|E
50|$|Although most of {{the dose}} was {{directed}} at the feet, a substantial amount would scatter or leak in all directions. Shielding materials were sometimes displaced to improve image quality, to make the machine lighter, or out of carelessness, and this aggravated the leakage. The resulting whole-body dose may have been hazardous to the salesmen, who were chronically exposed, and to children, who are about twice as <b>radiosensitive</b> as adults. Monitoring of American salespersons found dose rates at pelvis height of up to 95 mr/week, {{with an average of}} 7.1 mr/week (up to ~50 mSv/a, avg ~3.7 mSv/an effective dose). A 2007 paper suggested that even higher doses of 0.5 Sv/a were plausible. The most widely accepted model of radiation-induced cancer posits that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation increases linearly with effective (i.e., whole-body) dose at a rate of 5.5% per Sv.|$|E

50|$|Paediatric Radiation Protection Issues: Children {{are more}} <b>radiosensitive</b> than adults.

The paediatric radiology and medical community has long had an awareness of this issue and has developed radiation protection policies and practices that reflect this. With {{the increased use of}} imaging and in particular, CT scanning, there is increasing attention to this issue by the entire medical and radiology communities. An educational resource for health care providers as well as patients and parents is the Image Gently web site started in 2008.http://www.imagegently.org/ There is collaboration by several radiology, medical physics, paediatrics, and governmental organizations to increase awareness of radiation safety issues in children and to provide education to all stakeholders caring for children on ways to decrease the ionizing radiation exposure in children http://www.imagegently.com.

In agreement with this hypothesis, a significant inverse correlation between telomere length and chromosomal radiosensitivity was observed in lymphocytes from 24 breast cancer patients and 5 normal individuals. In contrast, no chromosomal radiosensitivity was observed in mouse cell lines that showed shortened telomeres, possibly reflecting differences in radiation responses between primary cells and established cell lines.

40|$|With an {{experimental}} model of spontaneous lung metastases in immunosuppressed newborn rats, seven clones and variants with different metastatic potential and gangliosides expression {{were derived from}} a single parental human melanoma cell line M 4 Be. The cellular radiosensitivity of M 4 Be and its seven sublines was estimated using an in vitro colony assay. The total amount of gangliosides in M 4 Be and its seven sublines was determined by cell extraction and thin-layer chromatography, while the expression of GD 3 gangliosides was estimated by flow cytometry with a monoclonal antibody. The radiation-cell survival curves of most clones and variants derived from M 4 Be showed a zero dose extrapolation clearly lower than 100 %, suggesting that two populations of cells of very different radiosensitivity coexist within each of these clones and variants. Although the proportion of <b>radiosensitive</b> cells could be estimated from {{the shape of the}} survival curve, its radiosensitivity is too high to be properly evaluated by the colony assay. The eight survival curves differ essentially in the proportion of <b>radiosensitive</b> cells [...] which varied from 0 % to 40 % among M 4 Be and its seven sublines [...] whereas the cellular radiosensitivity of the radioresistant population was similar among them. The metastatic potential in vivo of M 4 Be and its seven sublines was not significantly related to the cellular radiosensitivity of their corresponding radioresistant population, but significantly increased with the fraction of <b>radiosensitive</b> cells. This relationship is valid only when the highly metastatic cells are cultured for no more than five passages in vitro as the fraction of <b>radiosensitive</b> cells is rapidly lost during subcultures. The relationship remains valid in vivo as metastatic melanoma-bearing newborn rats whole body irradiated with 20 cGy show no lung metastasis compared with controls. The <b>radiosensitive</b> cell fraction is inversely correlated with both the total ganglioside content (r = 0. 84, P < 0. 02) and the number of cells positively labelled with the monoclonal antibody directed to GD 3 (r = 0. 92, P < 0. 001). The incubation of a <b>radiosensitive</b> clone with the exogenous bovine brain ganglioside GM 1 significantly increases the proportion of radioresistant cells and suppresses its metastatic potential, while the inhibition of the endogenous gangliosides synthesis in the radioresistant cell line M 4 Be increases the proportion of <b>radiosensitive</b> cells.

The validity of the total of 171 genes as radiosensitivity related genes were certified by permutation test (P<. 05). Furthermore, we selected 62 genes on the basis of a clustering analysis, and confirmed the validity of these genes with cross-validation test. The cross-validation test also indicates the possibility of making prediction of radiosensitivity for discriminating radiation-sensitive from radiation resistant biopsy samples by predicting score (PS) values calculated from expression values of 62 genes in 19 samples, because the prediction successfully and unequivocally discriminated the <b>radiosensitive</b> phenotype from the radioresistant phenotype in our test panel of 19 cervical carcinomas. The extensive list of genes identified in these experiments provides a large body of potentially valuable information for studying the mechanism(s) of radiosensitivity, and selected 62 genes opens the possibility of providing appropriate and effective radiotherapy to cancer patients...|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} to know whether the human population includes genetically predisposed <b>radiosensitive</b> subsets. In vitro studies have shown that cells from individuals homozygous for ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) are much more <b>radiosensitive</b> than cells from unaffected individuals. Although cells heterozygous for the ATM gene (ATM(+/-)) may be slightly more <b>radiosensitive</b> in vitro, it remained to be determined whether the greater susceptibility of ATM(+/-) cells translates into an increased sensitivity for late effects in vivo, though there is a suggestion that radiotherapy patients that are heterozygous for the ATM gene may be more at risk of developing late normal tissue damage. We chose cataractogenesis in the lens as a means to assay for the effects of ATM deficiency in a late-responding tissue. One eye of wild-type, Atm heterozygous and homozygous knockout mice was exposed to 0. 5 -, 1. 0 -, 2. 0 -, or 4. 0 -Gy x rays. The animals were followed weekly for cataract development by conventional slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Cataract development in the animals of all three groups was strongly dependent on dose. The lenses of homozygous mice were the first to opacify at any given dose. Most important in the present context is that cataracts appeared earlier in the heterozygous versus wild-type animals. The data suggest that ATM heterozygotes in the human population may also be <b>radiosensitive.</b> This may influence the choice of individuals destined to be exposed to higher than normal doses of radiation, such as astronauts, and may also suggest that radiotherapy patients who are ATM heterozygotes could be predisposed to increased late normal tissue damage...|$|E

For the micronucleus assay lymphocytes were exposed in vitro to 3. 5 Gy 60 Co γ-rays at a high dose rate or low dose rate. 70 [*]h post-irradiation cultures were arrested and micronuclei were scored in 1000 binucleate cells. The results demonstrated that the group {{of breast cancer}} patients with a known or putative genetic predisposition was on the average more <b>radiosensitive</b> than a population of healthy women, and this with the G 2 {{as well as with the}} high dose rate and low dose rate micronucleus assay.
