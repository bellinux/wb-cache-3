50|$|Prop 36 is not retroactive, {{meaning that}} {{defendants}} {{who had to}} attend unlicensed drug <b>rehabs</b> prior to Prop 36 and the Drug Courts are not afforded {{the opportunity to have}} their cases reheard in court. Prop 36 and the Drug Courts have discontinued the use of unlicensed <b>rehabs</b> as sentencing tools, due to concerns that unlicensed treatment could be unethical. Many drug offenders who had used use unlicensed <b>rehabs</b> had been abused and are unable to appeal past convictions due to the formation of the Drug Courts. Unlicensed <b>rehabs</b> are no longer used, but people who relied on them are not afforded any of Prop 36's protection. If Prop 36's benefits had been extended retroactively, these people would have received them; at present, they do not.|$|R

50|$|When Amtrak {{took over}} in 1971, {{lightweight}} combines were used on most routes, particularly on trains which had used combines before Amtrak took over. As Amtrak started <b>rehabbing</b> their older cars to Heritage Fleet standards, the only combines which survived were the Baggage-Dorm cars. As Amtrak received the Superliner cars in all forms, including dorm cars, the only routes which required <b>rehabbed</b> single-level dorm cars were the East Coast routes (Crescent, Lake Shore Limited, Silver Star, etc.) due to low tunnel clearance. Because Amtrak had a surplus of single-level coaches due to the recent delivery of Amfleet coaches, baggage-coaches were unnecessary. Thus, baggage-dorm cars were the only cars that should logically be <b>rehabbed.</b> <b>Rehabbed</b> baggage-dorm cars were used on Amtrak East Coast routes from the early 1980s until 1996.|$|R
