40|$|The {{supergene}} <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intermediate <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the linnaeite-carrollite {{series by}} djurleite in the Carrizal Alto deposits {{has resulted in}} the development of microscopic inter-mediate zones consisting of essentially stoichiometric carrollite (Co,cuS+) and lesser amounts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cobalt sulfide mineral. The latter, with the approximate composition Coo nuS, exhibits physical properties and an X-ray powder pattern corresponding to synthetic F Cor-"S.

5000|$|Phase {{relations}} in the Cu-Co-S system have been investigated. [...] At temperatures around 900 °C a chalcocite-digenite solid solution coexists with cobalt sulfides. With decreasing temperature, at 880 °C a carrollite-linnaeite solid solution develops, becoming more copper-rich on cooling, with the carrollite composition at about 500 °C. Below 507 °C covellite is stable and coexists with copper-bearing cattierite. Low chalcocite appears at 103 °C, djurleite appears at 93 °C, and digenite disappears and anilite appears around 70 °C. There is some evidence for supergene <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intermediate <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the linnaeite-carrollite series by djurleite.|$|R
