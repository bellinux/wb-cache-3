40|$|To {{describe}} physics properly, {{we need to}} {{take into}} account quantum effects. Thus, for every non-quantum physical theory, we must come up with an appropriate quantum theory. A traditional approach is to replace all the scalars in the classical description of this theory by the corresponding operators. The problem with the above approach is that due to non-commutativity of the quantum operators, two mathematically equivalent formulations of the classical theory can lead to different (non-equivalent) quantum theories. An alternative quantization approach that directly transforms the non-quantum action functional into the appropriate quantum theory, was indeed proposed by the Nobelist Richard Feynman, under the name of path integration. Feynman path integration is not just a foundational idea, it is actually an efficient computing tool (Feynman diagrams). From the pragmatic viewpoint, Feynman path integral is a great success. However, from the foundational viewpoint, we still face an important question: why the Feynman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>path</b> integration formula?

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} effects of distributed, multiplayer training video games on the performance of distributed teams of robot operators. Two hypotheses were tested, the first hypothesis stated that online, game-based team training will improve the performance of an ad-hoc team versus an ad-hoc team formed of individually trained teammates. The second hypothesis stated that the fractal dimension of a robot 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>path</b> can be used as an indicator of its operator 2 ̆ 7 s skill. Forty-one volunteers participated in an experiment in which they played a distributed, online training game which showed them the basics of operating an Inuktun Extreme VGTV for a search task. The participants were divided into two groups, one group trained in pairs as a team while the other group trained individually. The results showed that team training has no effect on the number of items found in a search by an ad-hoc team; however, team training does significantly impact the amount of information sharing between team members. The results also showed that the fractal dimension of a robot 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>path</b> is quadratically related to the operator 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness in a search task.

The path P is called an <b>s</b> − t <b>path</b> if v 0 = s and vm = t. The length of P is m. Here m {{is allowed to}} be 0. The distance from s to t is the minimum length of any <b>s</b> − t <b>path.</b> (If no <b>s</b> − t <b>path</b> exists, we set the distance from s to t equal to ∞.)

The results of these experiments reveal that fundamental preference characteristics are critical in predicting how long the market will take to reach a stable matching. In particular, intercorrelation and correlation are shown to have an exponential impact on the number of blocking pairs that must be randomly satisfied before stability is attained. The magnitude of the impact is dramatically different, however, depending on whether preferences are positively or negatively intercorrelated...|$|R
