50|$|The Chilean horse or Chilean Corralero is a horse breed from South America. It is {{the oldest}} {{registered}} native American breed, the oldest registered breed of Iberian origin, the oldest <b>registered</b> <b>horse</b> breed in South America and the oldest registered stock horse breed in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|A {{horse that}} is {{registered}} is one recorded with a breed registry or stud book, having written documentation of its pedigree. A grade horse has no registration papers, and usually sells for significantly {{less money than}} a <b>registered</b> <b>horse.</b> However, some grade horses with special talent or a proven performance record in a given discipline may become valuable on their individual merits. A case in point was Snowman, a workhorse who became a show jumper and was eventually inducted into the United States Show Jumping Hall of Fame.|$|E
5000|$|Today, {{although}} {{horses are}} no longer bred for military uses, there are still civilian uses for horses. [...] As {{the primary goal of}} the Yeguada Militar remains to produce stallions to improve the bloodstock of horses through Spain, the Yeguada Militar keeps about 35 Arabian broodmares and between 100 and 120 Andalusian (PRE) mares. [...] They also own about 100 stallions kept at the stallion depots to cover mares owned by private breeders for a very low stud fee. Other stallions remain at Jerez de la Frontera. [...] If a stallion {{is not going to be}} used to sire a <b>registered</b> <b>horse,</b> the owner of the mare pays no stud fee. Private breeders may also ask the government to be allowed to stand a Yeguara Militar stallion at their own farm for a limited period.|$|E
5000|$|Breeding stock: a solid <b>horse</b> <b>registered</b> {{with one}} of the various {{registries}} that <b>registers</b> <b>horses</b> with pinto markings, such as the American Paint Horse Association (APHA), which <b>registers</b> these <b>horses</b> under a special designation of [...] "Solid Paint Bred" [...] (SPB).|$|R
5000|$|Today the Dutch Friesian {{registry}} (FPS, Friese Paarden Stamboek) and its American counterpart (FHANA, Friesian Horse Association North America) prohibit their <b>registered</b> <b>horses</b> {{from being}} used to create crossbred horses. [...] However, the German Friesian registry (FPZV, Friesenpferde Zuchtverband e. V.) and its American counterpart (FPZV USA) do allow their <b>registered</b> <b>horses</b> to be crossbred with other breeds, {{but they will not}} register the crossbred offspring. [...] Both the Dutch and German registries have recognized the severe risks of inbreeding this has created in the breed, and have created policy committees to try to reduce these risks.|$|R

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Warmblood horse studbooks aim to breed horses with a conformation {{that will enable}} elite future performance, but {{reduce the risk of}} injuries and lameness. Negative conformational traits, such as asymmetrical or 'uneven' forefeet would possibly diminish performance. Objectives: To assess the prevalence and heritability of uneven feet and its genetic relationship to other conformation traits as well as to sporting performance later in life in Warmblood riding horses. Methods: The databases of the Royal Dutch Warmblood Studbook (KWPN, n = 44, 840 horses) and Royal Dutch Equestrian Sports Federation (KNHS, n = 33, 459 horses in dressage and n = 30, 474 horses in showjumping) were linked through the unique number of each <b>registered</b> <b>horse.</b> Therefore, heritabilities and genetic and phenotypic correlations could be estimated from the scores of the jury at studbook admission and the sports performance of that population in dressage and jumping over the period 1990 - 2002. Results: The prevalence of uneven feet was 5. 3 % on average, and increased from under 4. 5 % during the first 3 years of recording to over 8 % in the years from 2000 onwards. Heritability estimates of foot conformation traits were moderate and ranged from 0. 16 for heel height to 0. 27 for hoof shape. The genetic correlation between the trait of uneven feet and performance in competition was negative but weak: - 0. 09 with dressage and - 0. 12 with showjumping. Conclusions: Predisposition to uneven feet can be reduced by selection. Because of weak genetic correlations, the increased prevalence is not directly associated with selection for better sports performance or higher conformation grade. If the trait 'uneven feet' arises from a disproportionate relationship between height at the withers and neck length, then selection on conformation grade might result in development of uneven feet. In general, limb conformation has a moderate genetic relationship to conformation grade and foot conformation traits have a genetic relationship to sporting performance. Reducing occurrence of uneven feet by selection is possible, without limiting progress in sport performance...|$|E
50|$|The Nokota Horse Registry is {{the breed}} registry, {{organized}} by the Nokota Horse Conservancy.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to analyse the numbers and division of horses of undefined breed. At the present time this group is the most numerous in the entire population of horses. Horses of undefined breed do not come under any breeder union which would provide reports about these horses; these <b>horses</b> are only <b>registered</b> and breeders are informed only about their numbers. Our study is the first to deal with the problem of increasing numbers of horses of undefined breed. The database contained 22 â 211 <b>horses</b> not entered <b>registered</b> in any of the stud books. In the database we filed approved horses born between 1972 and 1 September 2012 and <b>horses</b> <b>registered</b> from 1987. The data were processed in the Excel programme and results were evaluated in graphs. The most frequent horse in this group was the warm-blood type (n = 9 â 303), pony type (n = 6 â 285), cold-blooded type (n = 2 â 663) and unlisted horses (n = 2 â 278). Since 2001 the number of <b>registered</b> <b>horses</b> of undefined breed has increased. The most numerous dams of horses of undefined breed is the Czech warm-blood with 1 â 912 offspring; dams of the English Thoroughbred with 552 offspring and mares of the utility Huzule horse with 492 offspring. In the group of <b>registered</b> <b>horses</b> of undefined breed the Czech warm-blood appears in the pedigree of 507 colts and the American Paint Horse in the pedigree of sires of 506 colts. Why the numbers of horses of undefined breed are increasing is the boom of leisure horsemanship and unqualified horse breeding...|$|R
