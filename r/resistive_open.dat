40|$|Abstract This paper {{addresses}} the {{problems related to}} <b>resistive</b> <b>opens</b> and bridging faults that lie out {{of the most critical}} paths. These faults cannot be detected by traditional delay fault testing because the induced delay defects are not large enough to result in timing violations when the test rate is equal to the nominal operating frequency. In spite of this problem, <b>resistive</b> <b>opens</b> and bridgings should be detected because they may give rise to reliability problems. To detect them, we propose a testing method that is based on the propagation of pulses within the faulty circuit and that exploits the degraded capability of faulty paths to propagate pulses. The effectiveness of our method is analyzed at the transistor level and compared with the use of reduced clock periods to detect the same class of faults.

40|$|Abstract—Under {{manufacturing}} process variation, {{a path through}} a net is called longest if there exists a process condition under which the path has the maximum delay among all paths through the net. There are often multiple longest paths for each net, due to different process conditions. In addition, a local defect, such as <b>resistive</b> <b>open</b> or a resistive bridge, increases the delay of the affected net. To detect delay faults due to local defects and process variation, {{it is necessary to}} test all longest paths through each net. Previous approaches to this problem were inefficient because of the large number of paths that are not longest. This paper presents an efficient method to generate the set of longest paths for delay test under process variation. To capture both structural and process correlation between path delays, we use linear delay functions to express path delays under process variation. A novel technique is proposed to prune paths that are not longest, resulting in a significant {{reduction in the number of}} paths. In experiments on ISCAS circuits, our number of longest paths is 1 % to 6 % of the previous best approach, with 300 X less running time...|$|E
