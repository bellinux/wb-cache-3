50|$|During the {{production}} {{life of the}} Comanche, six different transmissions were offered, manufactured by Aisin, Chrysler, and Peugeot. Aisin provided the AX-4 (four-speed), AX-5 and AX-15 (five-speed overdrive) manual transmissions, along with the AW-4 four-speed automatic that was used beginning in 1987. This is the same Warner transmission used in early- to mid-1990s Toyota 4Runners with the 3.0 and some 22re 4wd. The AX-15 was phased in to replace the Peugeot BA-10/5 five-speed {{that had been used}} from 1987 until mid-1989 behind the 4.0 L I6 engine. The Comanche came equipped with a weight sensing <b>rear</b> brake <b>proportioning</b> valve.|$|R
50|$|The cattle are red, preferably {{deep red}} with white {{only on the}} tail switch and udder. They are {{naturally}} polled (without horns). Red Poll cattle are mainly used as beef suckler cows, although a few dairy herds are found in England, {{as well as in}} the United States in the state of Texas. They are known for easy calving and successfully <b>rearing</b> a high <b>proportion</b> of their calves. They are sometimes used for conservation grazing.|$|R
40|$|Variation in the {{sex ratio}} at {{hatching}} in the chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica was investigated, using molecular sexing to test predictions of sex allocation theory. The sex ratio was slightly male-biased (0. 54) but {{did not differ significantly}} from parity. The proportion of males increased with nest size, an estimator of parental quality in chinstrap penguins. High-quality parents were able to produce and <b>rear</b> a higher <b>proportion</b> of male offspring, the more costly sex in this slightly sexually dimorphic species. Our results may be in agreement with Trivers and Willard's (1973) argument on biases in the offspring sex ratio being contingent on parental condition or quality. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

50|$|On the VTX1800, Honda updated its linked braking feature, {{instead of}} having the usual {{separate}} hand and foot brakes, the hand brake operated two-thirds of the front pistons while the foot operated the other third in front and all the <b>rear</b> via a <b>proportioning</b> valve. The induction system was Honda's programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) system using a Manifold Air Pressure (MAP) sensor in the small throttle areas until the standard throttle position sensor (Alpha N) took over at greater throttle opening values. The VTX1800 also had an emission control system that utilized air injection and catalytic converter controlled by the ECU to reduce hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen to levels surpassing emissions standards.|$|R
40|$|I {{present a}} model demonstrating that, in social Hymenoptera, split sex {{allocation}} {{can influence the}} evolution of reproductive partitioning (skew). In a facultatively polygynous population (with one to several queens per colony), workers vary in their relative relatedness to females (relatedness asymmetry). Split sex-ratio theory predicts that workers in monogynous (single-queen) colonies should concentrate on female production, as their relatedness asymmetry is relatively high, whereas workers in the polygynous colonies should concentrate on male production, as their relatedness asymmetry is relatively low. By contrast, queens in all colonies value males more highly per capita than they value females, because the worker-controlled population sex ratio is too female-biased from the queens' standpoint. Consider a polygynous colony in a facultatively polygynous population of perennial, social Hymenoptera with split sex ratios. A mutant queen achieving reproductive monopoly would gain from increasing her share of offspring but, because the workers would assess her colony as monogynous, would lose from the workers <b>rearing</b> a greater <b>proportion</b> of less-valuable females from the colony's brood. This sets an upper limit on skew. Therefore, in social Hymenoptera, skew evolution is potentially affected by queen-worker conflict over sex allocation...|$|R
40|$|Models {{of sexual}} {{selection}} propose that exaggerated secondary sexual ornaments indicate a male 2 ̆ 7 s own fitness and the fitness of his offspring. These hypotheses have rarely been thoroughly tested in free-living individuals because overall fitness, {{as opposed to}} fitness components, is difficult to measure. We used 20 years of data from song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) inhabiting Mandarte Island, British Columbia, Canada, to test whether a male 2 ̆ 7 s song repertoire size, a secondary sexual trait, predicted overall measures of male or offspring fitness. Males with larger song repertoires contributed more independent and recruited offspring, and independent and recruited grandoffspring, to Mandarte 2 ̆ 7 s population. This was because these males lived longer and <b>reared</b> a greater <b>proportion</b> of hatched chicks to independence from parental care, not because females mated to males with larger repertoires laid or hatched more eggs. Furthermore, independent offspring of males with larger repertoires {{were more likely to}} recruit and then to leave more grandoffspring than were offspring of males with small repertoires. Although we cannot distinguish whether observed fitness variation reflected genetic or environmental effects on males or their offspring, these data suggest that female song sparrows would gain immediate and intergenerational fitness benefits by pairing with males with large song repertoires...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition and body proportions of Achatina fulica (Bowdich), Achatina achatina (Linné) and Archachatina ventricosa (Gould) fed a concentrated diet were investigated and compared with wild A. fulica, A. achatina and Arch. ventricosa. Wild and artificially <b>reared</b> snail shell <b>proportion</b> were 42. 09 and 46. 91 %; 47. 20 and 52. 96 %; 48. 02 and 51. 96 % {{of the whole}} body, respectively, for A. fulica, A. achatina and Arch. ventricosa. The pedal mass proportion was 41. 36 and 36. 66 %; 27. 80 and 26. 62 % than 36. 59 and 32. 71 %, respectively, for wild and reared A. fulica, A. achatina and Arch. ventricosa. The pedal mass mean energy, dry matter, proteins, lipid and mineral matter content were 53. 21 cal/ 100 g; 12. 86 % by weight of deshelled snails; 63. 98 / DM (% of dry matter); 15. 80 /DM and 8. 96 /DM in A. achatina. For A. fulica pedal mass average energy, dry matter, proteins and mineral matter content were 47. 82 cal/ 100 g; 13. 63 % by weight of deshelled snails; 58. 94 /DM and 14. 92 /DM. Arch. ventricosa pedal mass mean energy, dry matter, proteins, lipid and mineral matter content were 50. 32 cal/ 100 g; 14. 19 % in weight of deshelled snails; 66. 36 /DM; 13. 43 /DM and 10. 25 /DM.

40|$|Social Hymenoptera {{have become}} key organisms for tests of sex-ratio theory. We assess {{the role of}} {{resources}} for explaining sex-ratio variation in a highly male-biased population of the ant Formica exsecta. Key predictions {{of two of the}} three leading hypotheses invoking an effect of resource availability on sex ratios in social insects are not upheld. One prediction of the multifaceted parental-investment hypothesis is that colonies with greater brood production will <b>rear</b> a greater <b>proportion</b> of their diploid offspring as reproductive females (gynes), rather than workers, This study shows the positive correlation between female-biased sex ratio and the production of brood by female-producing colonies was not the outcome of a trade-off in the production of workers vs. gynes. The main prediction of the constant-female hypothesis is that investment in gynes should be constant. We found extreme variation among colonies in the number of gynes produced. By contrast, all the predictions of the queen-replenishment hypothesis were supported. The queen-replenishment hypothesis predicts that colonies produce gynes only when queen number is so low that colony production of brood is reduced, or colony survival threatened. We found that, as predicted by this hypothesis, female-producing colonies had fewer queens and produced a lower biomass of brood than male-producing colonies. In contrast, male-producing colonies had lower production per queen, and {{were more likely to be}} limited by external resources. This suggests that queen number limits production in female-producing colonies. These data provide evidence of adaptive adjustment of resources to worker, gyne, and male brood...|$|R
40|$|Characteristics of pedal cycle crashes (as {{reported}} to the police) in South Australia, and how they have changed over the period 1981 - 2004, are examined. The paper describes both the present situation (2001 - 2004) and how it has changed since 1981; both child and adult casualties; both the numbers of casualties and the proportions seriously injured; and both factors that are commonly tabulated and some that are relatively unusual. In 1981, pedal cyclist casualties were mostly children and teenagers, but in 2004, pedal cyclist casualties were mostly spread across the age range from 16 to 49. Child pedal cyclist casualties reached a maximum in 1982 - 1987, and have fallen sharply since. Adult pedal cyclist casualties reached a maximum in 1987 - 1990, and then fell. Concerning the proportion of casualties seriously injured (i. e., killed or admitted to hospital), in 2001 - 2004 this proportion among adults (16 +) was 12 % when the speed limit was 60 km/h or less, and 33 % when the speed limit was 70 km/h or higher. Among the four most frequent types of crashes (right angle, side swipe, right turn, and <b>rear</b> end), the <b>proportions</b> of adult casualties seriously injured were 11 %, 11 %, 16 %, and 18 %. The proportion was 14 % for male drivers {{of the motor vehicle}} and 9 % for female drivers; it was 17 %, 15 %, 15 %, 14 %, 10 %, and 11 % for motor vehicle driver age groups 16 - 19, 20 - 29, 30 - 39, 40 - 49, 50 - 59, and 60 - 99.

40|$|Cooperative {{behaviours}} are {{ubiquitous in}} nature and puzzle scientists ever since Darwin formulated his theory for evolution through natural and sexual selection. Why should an individual help another one, if selection favours those maximising their own fitness? Indirect fitness benefits as first described by Hamilton, and alternatively, direct fitness benefits for cooperating individuals (for example through reciprocity) helped to explain the evolution of cooperation over the last 60 years. Understanding the evolution and maintenance of cooperative behaviours in nature nevertheless requires identifying the potential for conflict and the mechanisms in place to prevent exploitation. This thesis focuses on communal nursing in house mice (Mus musculus domesticus). Female mice show two alternative reproductive tactics; rearing their Young either solitarily, or pooling their litters in one nest and caring for all pups indiscriminately. Communal breeding {{can be observed in}} many different species, which is remarkable given the high costs of parental care. The potential for exploitation seems high, whenever females differ in the amount of care they provide to the joint litter, or the number of young they have in the nest. I combined experiments in the laboratory with data from a free living population to asses whether there is potential for conflict and to quantify the fitness consequences of the two alternative reproductive tactics in house mice. Communally nursing females invested according to the total number of pups in the nest, but not their own litter size, making them highly vulnerable to exploitation (Chapter 1). Accordingly, females with relatively fewer offspring in the nest overinvested. In the laboratory, females tried to avoid situations of high conflict by reducing their propensity to cooperate when females differed in litter size (Chapter 2). Furthermore, I found no evidence that females enforced their partner’s continued investment (Chapter 3). Overall, it seems females had only limited options to reduce the risk for exploitation after the formation of the communal nest, emphasising the importance of deciding beforehand whether, or with whom, to communally nurse. Data from a wild population revealed that communally nursing females suffered an increased pup mortality, resulting in a lower reproductive success for females <b>rearing</b> a larger <b>proportion</b> of their litters communally (Chapter 4). Older, and probably heavier females, were more likely to rear their litters solitarily, indicating that it represented a condition dependent alternative reproductive tactic. Younger females may have been unable to rear litters solitarily, therefore opting for communal nursing as a "best-of-a-bad-job", even at the cost of losing some of their offspring. The research presented in this thesis demonstrates the strong potential for conflict among communally breeding females and reveals that an apparent cooperative behaviour does not necessarily always result in benefits for all individuals involved. Plastic and condition dependent alternative reproductive tactics might nevertheless maintain such behaviours in the population, highlighting the importance for future research about the evolution of plasticity and its effect on cooperation...|$|R
