40|$|As female {{birds are}} able to lay {{no more than a}} single egg each day, in those species {{producing}} larger clutches the first laid eggs may get a developmental head-start over later eggs in the clutch. All other things being equal, the differential pattern of development <b>across</b> <b>the</b> clutch may contribute to hatching asynchrony and subsequent inequity in the competition between brood mates, and ultimately increase variance in the quality and fitness of first- and last-laid offspring. It has been suggested that females might allocate resources differently <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence to moderate the developmental rate and hatching time of different embryos. We tested this theory in the Zebra Finch Taeniopygia guttata, a common model species for investigating maternal effects in birds. We removed 758 eggs from 160 nests shortly after they were laid and used artificial incubators to control for parental effects and monitor hatching times. Eggs from larger clutches consistently hatched sooner than those from average-sized clutches, demonstrating that the intrinsic properties of an egg can alter the developmental time of embryos. There were also differences in the development time of eggs <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence, but these patterns were weaker, inconsistent and unrelated to sequential investment <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence in a straightforward way. This study indicates that maternal resource allocation to eggs <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence and <b>across</b> clutch sizes can influence development times and play a potentially important role in determining the competitive dynamics of broods. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Zebra finches {{have played}} a central role in the {{discovery}} of a variety of maternal effects over the past decade, with females shown to adjust resource allocation to their eggs in response to variables such as the appearance of their partner, their own condition, and the diet on which they are maintained. In addition to being the focus of some of the most high profile individual studies that have influenced maternal effects research in birds, the multitude of zebra finch studies together provide the most comprehensive set of data to illuminate general patterns and compare different maternally derived variables. Surprisingly, to date, virtually all of this work has focused on captive populations of the zebra finch that have been domesticated for many generations, and which are typically held under relatively constant environmental and dietary conditions. Here we report the first data on resource allocation <b>across</b> <b>the</b> egg <b>laying</b> sequence in a free-living wild population. Reassuringly we find that the patterns that have been found in the majority of studies of domesticated populations with respect to investment <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence were all present in the wild population. The size and mass of eggs increased through <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence whilst <b>the</b> concentration of carotenoids significantly decreased <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence. Although th ere was no significant pattern with respect to testosterone <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence <b>the</b> first two eggs had a higher level of testosterone than the last few eggs in the clutch, which is also consistent with the findings of earlier studies in captive populations. 5 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{created an}} {{algorithm}} {{to compensate for}} the saturation of data collected by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). Saturation of the energy measurements had made it impossible to measure surface roughness at 100 m length scales. By calculating the returned energy, the problem of saturation can be avoided. This algorithm was applied to MOLA data <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Martian surface to create an estimate of surface <b>roughness</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> planet. The method calculates pulse spreading from returned pulse energy using the link equation. The accuracy of the method is limited by the accuracy of albedo measurements. This analysis improved the estimation of surface roughness on Mars. Further improvements could be gained by correcting for the opacity of atmospheric dust as a cause of pulse spreading. by Andrew Benedict Mamo. Thesis (S. B.)

We find that variations in bed roughness are spatially organized, and attribute this to the varying efficacy of subglacial erosion and deposition, with rougher (inland, slow-flowing) regions largely manifesting preglacial topography, and smoother (downstream, fast-flowing) regions evincing significant postglacial modification to the subglacial landscape. The observed similarities between bed roughness characteristics of IIS/MIS and the Siple ice streams suggest that IIS and MIS are largely underlain by wet, poorly consolidated sediments, and may therefore be vulnerable to the types of dynamical instabilities experienced by the Siple ice streams...|$|R

40|$|Substantial {{amounts of}} {{maternal}} androgens {{are found in}} birds' eggs and {{have been shown to}} benefit offspring development. Within-clutch patterns of increasing androgen concentrations over <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence are often hypothesized to compensate for the negative effects of hatching asynchrony. However, detrimental effects to offspring fitness of exposure to high yolk androgen levels have also been demonstrated. This suggests that mothers should forego these costs to their offspring when the need for compensation for hatching asynchrony is low or when alternative compensatory strategies, e. g. in terms of increasing egg mass, are available. Here we show that in the south-temperate lesser double-collared sunbird Nectarinia chalybea, a species with hatching asynchrony but also with high survival of last-hatched chicks, mothers do not deposit resources differentially in terms of either yolk androgen concentration or egg mass <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence. We discuss to what extend this challenges the original explanation of within-clutch variation in these egg parameters and offer some explanation for their between-clutch variation which was related to female body mass...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} in the black-headed gull whether female deposition of antioxidants and immunoglobulins (enhancing early immune function), and testosterone (suppressing immune function and increasing early competitive skills) correlate suggesting that evolution has favoured the mutual adjustment of different pathways for maternal effects. We also took egg mass, {{the position of}} the egg in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence and offspring sex into account, as these affect offspring survival. Yolk antioxidant and immunoglobulin concentrations decreased <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> order, while yolk testosterone concentrations increased. This may substantially handicap the immune defence of last-hatched chicks. The decrease in antioxidant levels was greater when mothers had a low body mass and when the increase in testosterone concentrations was relatively large. This suggests that female black-headed gulls are constrained in the deposition of antioxidants in last-laid eggs and compensate for this by enhanced testosterone deposition. The latter may be adaptive since it re-allocates the chick’s investment from costly immune function to growth and competitive skills, necessary to overcome the consequences of hatching late from an egg of reduced quality. ...|$|R

40|$|Boundary-layer {{receptivity}} {{and stability}} of Mach 6 flows over smooth and rough seven-degree half-angle sharp-tipped cones are numerically investigated. The receptivity of the boundary layer to slow acoustic disturbances, fast acoustic disturbances, and vortical disturbances is considered. The effects of three-dimensional isolated roughness on the receptivity and stability are also simulated. The results for the smooth cone show that the instability waves are generated in the leading edge region and that the boundary layer is much more receptive to slow acoustic waves than to the fast acoustic waves. Vortical disturbances also generate unstable second modes, however the receptivity coefficients are smaller {{than that of the}} slow acoustic wave. Distributed roughness elements located near the nose region decreased the receptivity of the second mode generated by the slow acoustic wave by a small amount. <b>Roughness</b> elements distributed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> continuous spectrum increased the receptivity of the second mode generated by the slow and fast acoustic waves and the vorticity wave. The largest increase occurred for the vorticity wave. <b>Roughness</b> elements distributed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> synchronization point did not change the receptivity of the second modes generated by the acoustic waves. The receptivity of the second mode generated by the vorticity wave increased in this case, but the increase is lower than that occurred with <b>the</b> <b>roughness</b> elements located <b>across</b> <b>the</b> continuous spectrum. The simulations with an isolated roughness element showed that the second mode waves generated by the acoustic disturbances are not influenced by the small roughness element.

40|$|Hatching failure {{negatively}} impacts {{reproductive success}} in birds.

In most passerines, copulation declines in frequency or ceases altogether after <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> of <b>the</b> first egg, so eggs laid late in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence {{may be more likely to}} remain unfertilized. We tested this prediction in the Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus, a species in which late-laid eggs are particularly likely to be sperm-limited because it <b>lays</b> <b>the</b> largest clutch of any passerine. We assessed whether: (1) eggs laid later in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence are more likely to fail to develop, (2) larger clutches are more likely to contain undeveloped eggs, (3) the number of sperm present on the perivitelline layers of each egg decreases <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence and (4) the number of sperm present on the perivitelline layers of freshly laid eggs sampled from active clutches predicts the proportion of eggs that develop in the remainder of the clutch. The occurrence of undeveloped eggs was not related to their position in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence, nor was it related to clutch size. Within a clutch, sperm number did not differ between an egg laid early and an egg laid towards the end of <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence. Moreover, there was no indication that the proportion of undeveloped eggs in a clutch correlated with the number of sperm in a subset of eggs from that clutch, or that females laying larger clutches had stored more sperm.

40|$|Differential {{resource}} allocation by females <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence has been hypothesised {{as a mechanism}} through which females could either compensate nestlings that hatch last in asynchronous broods or promote brood reduction. In this study we artificially incubated eggs and cross-fostered offspring to manipulate nestlings' position in the hatching order, to identify whether the competitive ability of nestlings is dependent on position in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence. In both control and experimentally reversed broods, first hatched chicks had a higher survival than last hatched siblings. Yet, nestlings that hatched from eggs laid {{in the second half}} of a clutch begged with a greater intensity than nestlings hatched from eggs laid in the first half of a clutch. In natural broods, the greater begging competitiveness of nestlings from later-laid eggs led to a moderation of sibling competition and these nestlings achieved the same body size and weight as nestlings from eggs laid in the first half of the clutch. The lack of a substantial difference in the size and condition of surviving nestlings in respect to laying order suggests that differential {{resource allocation}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> egg-laying sequence partially compensates for hatching last in asynchronous broods and reduces the negative effects of the nestling size hierarchy. <b>The</b> effect of <b>laying</b> order, brood size and experimental treatment also differed for male and female nestlings.
