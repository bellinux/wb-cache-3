40|$|International audiencePost-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) and addiction to drugs of abuse are two common diseases, showing high comorbidity rates. This review presents {{a number of}} evidence showing similarities between these two pathologies, especially the hyper-responsiveness to environmental cues inducing a reactivation of the target memory leading either to re-experiencing (PTSD), or drug craving. Accordingly, PTSD and addiction to drug of abuse might by considered as memory pathologies, underlined by the same physiological process. We propose that these two pathologies rely on an uncoupling of the monoaminergic systems. According to this hypothesis, exposure to extreme conditions, either negative (trauma) or positive (drugs) induced a loss of the reciprocal control that one system usually exerts on the other monoaminergic system, resulting to an uncoupling between the noradrenergic and the serotonergic systems. Results obtained in our laboratory, using animal models of these pathologies, demonstrate that after a trauma, such as after repeated drug injections, rats developed both a behavioral sensitization (increases of the locomotion {{in response to a}} stimulation of the monoaminergic systems) and a pharmacological sensitization (increases of noradrenergic release within the prefrontal cortex). These results support our hypothesis and led us to propose new and innovative therapeutic approaches consisting either to induce a re-coupling of the monoaminergic systems, or to modify the pathological memories by using an emotional memory remodeling. Extremely encouraging results have already been obtained in rats and in humans, opening new and promising therapeutic avenues. Les troubles de stress post-traumatique (TSPT) et la dépendance aux drogues d’abus sont deux pathologies qui présentent un fort taux de comorbidité. Cette revue présente un certain nombre d’arguments montrant des ressemblances entre TSPT et dépendance aux drogues et notamment l’hyper-réactivité aux éléments de l’environnement qui se traduit par une réactivation des souvenirs cibles, conduisant soit à des <b>reviviscences</b> (TSPT), soit à des envies irrépressibles de drogue. Ainsi TSPT et dépendance aux drogues d’abus pourraient être des pathologies de la mémoire, reposant sur le dérèglement d’un même processus physiologique. Nous proposons que ces pathologies résultent d’un découplage des systèmes monoaminergiques. Cette revue explique les fondements de notre hypothèse et présente les résultats expérimentaux obtenus chez l’animal. Cette nouvelle conception permet d’envisager de nouvelles approches thérapeutiques qui ont été expérimentées pour ces deux pathologies chez l’animal et chez l’homme et dont les premiers résultats s’avèrent extrêmement encourageants...|$|R
40|$|To {{avoid the}} risk of {{bacterial}} <b>reviviscence</b> in a supply network, the water produced must contain very little dissolved organic matter and particular {{care must be taken}} to eliminate the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) which the bacteria can consume. Biological contactors, such as granular activated carbon (GAC) filters once colonized by bacteria, will no longer adsorb DOC but the biomass they fix can be used, within a water treatment system, to reduce the biodegradable carbon fraction. Consequently, the process appreciably. affects the quality of the water produced. Following studies on pilot and full-scale plants, we have assessed the operating parameters which must be applied in the process using the following methodologies: estimation of the bacterial activity in the filter - estimation of the biomass quantities fixed in the pilot plant - the kinetics of the biological processes involved. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|With {{the shift}} in {{perspective}} from temporary to permanent residence in this country, Sikhs are caught in between two polar ends of homeland and diaspora. This thesis attempts to illuminate a third – a universal permanence free of physical barriers. This account describes a movement towards establishing a Sikh homeland that is manifested in the collective Sikh body of the world {{rather than in the}} physical land of Punjab. The turban that is the physical identity of the Sikhs in diaspora has also come to represent the rigidities of the culture, which neglect the omnipresent divinity, and sacredness of every place. In its form and content, this thesis is engaged in “unfolding of the turban” to open it to the new worlds it is now a part of, to create a new beginning as a human body unfolds upon death into its five primal elements on the verge of <b>reviviscence.</b> Sikhs worldwide are aware of their need to convert diaspora back into a homeland, to fight against restrictions that hinder the completion of rituals of life and death. The unraveling of the turban into an undulating path allows for a new perspective on permanence for the Sikhs in foreign lands. Unfolded into a form of the meandering river, the turban also represents the eternally flowing waters. The silent sacredness of the water indistinctly exists in Toronto. Behind the towering city, the Don River often flows quietly, leading a life parallel to that of the River Ganges and the River Sutlej. This once pastoral valley that sustained villages and nature is now discarded, in post-industrial despair. Trapped within these modern city confines, the river still secretly retains the power to transfigure souls, but its powers of <b>reviviscence</b> remain unidentified and unused due to restrictive cremation bylaws. This thesis attempts to create for the Sikhs an essential funeral landscape, whose icons may be read through an anamorphic lens of Sikh culture, while providing for all an opportunity to engage the forgotten river, and its energy...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{compounds}} used {{to treat}} fish diseases in aquaculture and the ornamental fish industry (such as formalin and malachite green) can be more toxic to the hosts than their parasites. With the <b>reviviscence</b> {{in the use of}} herbal products, various botanicals have been heralded as cures for particular pathogens, but the efficacy of these compounds for parasitic worms is questionable. Here, we tested a range of garlic (Allium sativum) products against a major aquarium pathogen, Gyrodactylus turnbulli, infecting the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). All garlic products significantly reduced parasite mean survival time in vitro, from 13 h to < 1 h. In fully randomised trials, the number of parasites was also significantly reduced on infected fish exposed to garlic from different sources. Two garlic treatments (minced and granule forms) reduced worm burdens by 66 % and 75 % after three doses, whereas Chinese freeze-dried garlic and allyl disulphide were 95 % effective after a single application. In fact, Chinese freeze dried garlic was equally effective as Levamisole, a licensed livestock dewormer that is highly effective against G. turnbulli but not routinely prescribed for use in fish; hence, garlic may be a potential alternative treatment for gyrodactylosis...|$|E
40|$|For a long time, {{adolescence}} as {{a concept}} has been little or not invested by human sciences. The most confused period of human life {{is more than a}} mere transformation of psychological order. This theorization attempt aims to combine three ideas around adolescence: the violence of the desire, the incestuous temptation and the creative passion. Rite or initiation, adolescence is a period when violence and aggressivity, in their creative or destructive function, are both the motor and the ordeal of this existential and vital passage. Between passage, transition and rebirth, adolescence is above all a negociation with oneself, one's family and the others. At this age of one's life, the narcissistic passion devours the self representation and weakens the subject. Transformation of the body and the mind, <b>reviviscence</b> of the former (OEdipian) conflicts, quest for identity and autonomy, violence of the feelings and sexualization of the desire are inherent to this fundamental 'stage' of human life. The violence of the crisis coincides with that of the desire because the genuine stake of adolescence is to desire elsewhere, outside the OEdipian family. Alliance between the being of yesterday and that of to-morrow, crisis of passage and crisis of desire, adolescence is the mirror where the affecting image of a childhood which fades in order to re-emerge is reflected, just where the desire can open up.

40|$|Les étapes de désinfection de l'eau, telles que l'ozonation et la chloration, génèrent des sous-produits d'oxydation de nature variée. Ces composés sont soupçonnés d'être toxiques à plus ou moins long terme. Certains d'entre eux sont, de plus, {{facilement}} biodégradables et favorisent donc une <b>reviviscence</b> bactérienne dans le réseau de distribution. Enfin, à cause de leurs caractéristiques organoleptiques, ils peuvent conduire à la détérioration de la qualité sensorielle de l'eau distribuée. La recherche de plusieurs sous-produits d'oxydation dans l'eau potable a pu être effectuée grâce à de nouvelles techniques d'analyse quantitative par chromatographie en phase gazeuse: il s'agit des aldéhydes et des cétones de faible poids moléculaire, des acides haloacétiques et de certains céto-acides. Ces composés ont été recherchés dans des usines comportant une étape d'ozonation. L'influence de ce traitement sur {{la formation}} des aldéhydes et des céto-acides est démontrée dans cette étude. L'ozonation multiplie la concentration totale d'aldéhydes par un facteur variant de 2 à 4 suivant les usines et les trois céto-acides recherchés ont été trouvés en quantités importantes dans des eaux ozonées. La filtration sur charbon, lorsqu'elle existe, s'avère efficace pour l'élimination de ces composés. Les trois acides chloroacétiques sont présents dans des eaux chlorées, en sortie d'usines appliquant des taux de chloration assez importants. Enfin, I'évolution de ces sous-produits d'oxydation tout au long d'un réseau de distribution a pu être expliquée par leur biodégradabilité. New regulations are being {{considered by the}} US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) concerning a variety of disinfection by-products formed during chlorination and ozonation (halonitriles, haloketones, haloacids, low molecular weight aldehydes [...] .) and many surveys are underway to assess the presence of such products in drinking waters. This renewed interest for disinfection byproducts (DBPs) arises from their suspected carcinogenic or mutagenic properties. In addition to possible long term health effects, specific disinfection by-products may also induce immediate water quality deterioration due to their objectionable organoleptic properties. Biodegradable DBP's also probably contribute a substantial proportion of the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). As far as oxidation disinfection practices in France are concerned, the use of ozone is frequent. Also, most major French treatment plants include an activated carbon filtration process {{which is likely to}} remove some of the DBPs {{as well as some of}} their precursors. This paper summarizes the results obtained along various treatment plants in the Paris area, concerning three major families of DBPs considered for regulation: the DBPs investigated include 30 aldehydes and ketones, chloroacetic acids and 3 ketoacids. The aldehydes and ketones were measured by GC-ECD or GC-MS after derivatization with PFBHA; the chloroacetic acids were measured using a micro extraction method with methyltertiobutylether followed by diazomethane methylation and GC-ECD or GC-MS; the six plants investigated in the Paris area treat surface water from the river Seine upstream of Paris (Morsang, Vigneux, Orly, Ivry) or groundwater which is artificially recharged with Seine river water downstream of Paris (Le Pecq, Aubergenville). The Alençon plant which is located outside the Paris area treats raw water from the Sarthe river plus groundwater from various wells. All the treatment lines studied include an ozonation step which is followed at some plants (Morsang, Ivry, Vigneux, Le Pecq-Minor) by a granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration. The treatment line investigated at Vigneux used an ozone/hydrogen peroxide combination as an oxidation step. Three of these treatment lines (Morsang, Le Pecq-Minor, Alençon) comprise a prechlorination step; the other plants only use chlorination as a final disinfection step. The study compares the total concentration of aldehydes detected before and after ozonation as well as after GAC filtration. Approximately half of this total is usually due to formaldehyde while acetaldehyde, glyoxal and methylglyoxal represent most of the remainder. These concentrations which initially range from 1 to 25 µg/l show a drastic increase after ozonation. Depending on the water DOC and ozonation conditions, the total level of aldehydes is multiplied by a factor of 2 to 4. The final chlorine disinfection step used at all these plants does not significantly influence the total concentration of the aldehydes, therefore the level of these DBPs at the outlet of the plants is mainly determined by the ozonation or ozone/GAC filtration steps. The three aldo and ketoacids analysed were glyoxylic acid, pyruvic acid and ketomalonic acid. They were detected in ozonated water with total concentrations which range from 65 to 80 µg/l. Glyoxylic acid alone, represents half of these quantities. Chloroacetic acids were not detected at the outlet of the plants which are supplied by groundwater (Le Pecq-Minor, Aubergenville) and which apply a low chlorine dose (0. 1 - 0. 2 ppm) as a final disinfection stop. Although the Morsang treatment line investigated applies a low prechlorination dose ([smaller or equal] 1 ppm) in addition to the low postchlorination dose, no haloacids were detected at the outlet, which is agreement with the low levels of trihalomethanes usually detected at this plant. The absence of haloacids at the outlet of this plant can be attributed to the efficiency of the ozone/GAC combination as well as to the low prechlorination dose applied. Haloacids were only detected at the outlet of the Orly, Ivry and Alençon plants which apply a rather high chlorine dose during the final disinfection stop (between 0. 8 and 2. 2 ppm) in order to maintain a residual in the distribution system. Typical levels of haloacids are found between 10 and 35 µg/l, mainly under the form of dichloro and trichloroacetic acid. To summarize, the levels of the specific DBPs investigated remain well below their individual WHO recommendations (respectively 50, 100 and 900 µg/ 1 for dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and formaldehyde). Unless more drastic national regulations are implemented, the interest in the fate of these DBP's mainly lies in their possible secondary effects such as enhancement of bacterial regrowth in distribution systems or degradation of drinking water organoleptic properties...|$|E
40|$|La chloration sur les réseaux de {{distribution}} d’eau potable constitue une tâche délicate. Elle assure la protection contre la <b>reviviscence</b> microbienne et contre la contamination du réseau. Les réactions du chlore avec la matière organique du système entraînent {{la formation}} des sous‑produits chlorés, indésirables pour la santé humaine. Ainsi, le maintien du taux de chlore libre à des valeurs admissibles, sur tout le réseau et à tout moment, constitue un objectif principal des gestionnaires des réseaux. Lors de la chloration à partir des sources d’eau, les processus de réaction-transport créent sur les réseaux, caractérisés par des temps de séjours importants, de mauvaises distributions des taux de chlore libre. Les stations d’appoints sur les réseaux constituent une alternative efficace. La détermination de leur nombre et le choix des emplacements optimums constituent les deux difficultés auxquelles sont confrontés les gestionnaires. Le présent travail utilise un algorithme génétique (AG) pour la détermination du nombre et des emplacements optimums des stations d’appoint de chlore sur les réseaux. Deux objectifs ont été fixés : (1)  l’amélioration de l’homogénéité spatio-temporelle de la chloration et (2)  la minimisation du nombre de stations d’appoint. L’application du modèle développé sur un réseau test a permis d’identifier les emplacements des deux stations d’appoint de chlore. La solution optimale a considérablement amélioré l’homogénéité et a assuré, pour 98  % des noeuds, des taux de chlore libre dans l’intervalle admissible (0, 1 - 0, 5)   mg/L. The chlorination {{of drinking water}} networks represents a delicate task. It ensures protection against microbial regrowth and network contamination. However, chlorine also reacts with organic matter {{in the system and}} leads to the formation of chlorinated by-products, which are undesirable for the human health. Thus, one of the main objectives of the water network manager is to maintain acceptable levels of free residual chlorine, at all network nodes and at all times. When water sources are chlorinated, reaction-transport processes create an unbalanced distribution of free chlorine concentrations, especially in networks characterized by long water residence times. Booster stations in networks constitute an efficient alternative to improve the spatial and temporal chlorine distribution. Their number and their optimum locations are two challenges facing network managers. In this respect, this paper suggests the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the number and the optimum locations of chlorine booster stations in networks. The two main objectives of this study were: (1) the improvement of the spatio-temporal homogeneity of chlorination and (2) the reduction of the number of booster stations. A solution to this optimisation problem is an arrangement of ns booster stations in n consumption nodes of the water network. To resolve this problem, we linked the toolkit of the hydrodynamic computer program EPANET, which uses a one-dimensional reaction-transport model, to the proposed genetic algorithm (GA). In this application, we assume that free chlorine reactions through distribution networks are first-order. First, the EPANET computer program simulates temporal and spatial chlorine spreading in the network for each solution. Next, the GA calculates the sum square deviation E(NN, T), for the average chlorine concentration required for adequate sanitation (0. 1 ‑ 0. 5)  mg/L, which corresponds to an optimal free chlorine concentration of 0. 3  mg/L in the network. The number of booster stations is also defined for each solution studied. The optimal solution must minimize the sum square deviation and the number of booster stations used. Therefore, solution j can be evaluated by its fitness representing the weighted sum of the homogeneity function Fh(j) and the function of booster stations number Fsmin(j). According to the fitness of the solution, genetic operators (tournament selection, two points crossover and mutation) associated with an elitist evolution strategy (ES), combine individuals and create new populations. This iterative process explores the solution space and improves the maximum population fitness until stagnation, to achieve the optimal individual. The test network configuration maintained for modelling is formed by a tank and 20  km of pipes. The stretched-out shape of the network imposed long water residence times and usually created an unbalanced distribution of free chlorine concentrations at consumption nodes. In order to evaluate chlorination, three control nodes were chosen: N 145 (first consumption node), N 168 (middle of the network) and N 206 (extremity of the network). For this network example, the best initial chlorination homogeneity was reached with a constant free chlorine concentration equal to 0. 5  mg/L, usually imposed by the manager at the exit of the water tank. This initial management approach created in the network a sum square deviation of 65. 9  mg 2 /L 2, as well as an unbalanced spatial chlorination distribution with 27 % of the consumption nodes having free chlorine concentrations less than the minimum required value for adequate sanitation (0. 1  mg/L). The simulation of higher free chlorine concentrations at the exit of the water tank (0. 8  mg/L) led to concentrations above the maximum value required for adequate human health protection (0. 5  mg/L) at 26 % of the consumption nodes. Also, 10 % of the nodes had concentrations lower than the minimum concentration required for human health. For all constant chlorination scheduling studied (0. 4; 0. 5; 0. 6; 0. 7 and 0. 8  mg/L), an important fraction of consumption nodes remained with free chlorine concentrations outside the desired concentration range. Therefore, this management approach is not suitable for networks with long residence times. Before its application, the GA required the definition of the crossover and the mutation probability (respectively 0. 9 and 0. 05), the size of the population (100) and the maximum number of generations (300). In addition, in the present application, chlorination homogeneity and the reduction of the booster stations number (p 1  = p 2  =  0. 5) were given the same importance. According to boundary conditions, we imposed a free chlorine concentration of 0. 5  mg/L at both the exit of the water tank and at the booster stations. The application of the GA, developed in this study, ensures the evolution of the initial population until stagnation of its maximum fitness. The resulting optimal solution involved the creation of two booster stations at nodes N 179 and N 196. The simulation of this chlorination management improves the spatio-temporal homogeneity of free chlorine concentrations in consumption nodes. It reduced the sum square deviation from 65. 9 to 38. 8  mg 2 /L 2. Finally, 98 % of the consumption nodes had free chlorine concentrations (0. 1 - 0. 5  mg/L) that were required in the context of human health. This model represents a first step in the optimization of chlorination homogeneity in networks characterized by long water residence times. The use of this tool requires network hydraulic modelling, the simulation of the free chlorine behaviour, the definition of the chlorine reaction coefficients and the GA parameters. The optimization of the chlorine concentration scheduling (in water sources and in booster stations) represents an additional step in the present work...|$|E
40|$|Afin d'étudier la <b>reviviscence</b> bactérienne dans les réseaux de distribution, des méthodes de mesures de la biomasse et de l'activité bactérienne ont été investiguées sur des eaux provenant d'un réseau de distribution. Trois méthodes d'estimation de la biomasse bactérienne ont été comparées : le comptage sur gélose, selon la norme française d'examen bactériologique des eaux de consommation, le dosage de l'ADN contenu dans les {{particules}} retenues sur une membrane de porosité de 0. 2 µm et le comptage direct au microscope à épifluorescence après coloration des bactéries à l'acridine orange. Les comptages sur gélose, tout comme en milieu aquatique naturel, sous-estiment très largement le nombre de bactéries; ceci semble principalement lié à la présence de bactéries viables mais non cultivables. Le dosage de l'ADN et les comptages directs corrèlent assez bien avec en moyenne un contenu en ADN par bactérie de 4, 1 x 10 - 15 g d'ADN, mais la première méthode semble moins précise. Le comptage direct semble donc la méthode la plus adaptée à l'estimation du nombre total de bactéries dans ce type de milieu. Afin d'estimer l'activité bactérienne, les protocoles expérimentaux de deux méthodes utilisées en écologie bactérienne ont été adaptés aux conditions particulières de l'eau de distribution : l'incorporation de thymidine tritiée dans l'ADN bactérien et l'incorporation de leucine tritiée dans les protéines. La comparaison des deux méthodes sur une série d'échantillons montre une bonne corrélation, avec un rapport molaire entre incorporation de leucine et de thymidine compatible avec les facteurs de conversion des deux méthodes cités dans la littérature et établis pour les milieux aquatiques naturels. Les deux méthodes sont utilisables pour mesurer l'activité bactérienne dans l'eau potable, néanmoins l'incorporation de thymidine est plus aisée à mettre en oeuvre, car elle ne nécessite de travailler qu'à une seule concentration en traceur radioactif. Bacterial regrowth in distribution {{systems is}} an important problem for drinking water producers. It {{is linked to the}} more and more frequent utilization of low quality surface waters, containing high concentration of organic matter, as raw water, and also to the increase in size and complexity of the distribution networks with high residence time of the water between its production and utilization. At the present time chlorination of treated water, with sometimes rechlorination in the network, is the usual way to limit growth in distribution systems. This solution however presents disadvantages, the major one is the formation of unpleasant organochlorine compounds which are responsible for tastes and odours of water. An alternative strategy consists of developing treatment lines in which biodegradable dissolved organic carbon is removed. It allows through a reduction of the chlorine demand of the water to increase the stability of the chlorine residual of the water. In this context, it is important to get a good knowledge of the factors controlling bacterial development in distribution networks. Up to now, studies on this subject have met some methodological problems linked to the fact that classical bacteriological methods are inadequate to study this kind of systems. In this paper, various methods have been investigated to estimate bacterial biomass and activity in tap water. For this study, the analyzed water samples have been collected in the distribution system of the Parisian suburbs. Three methods have been tested for the determination of bacterial biomass : plate count, measurement of DNA associated with particles with a size higher than 0. 2 µm and direct microscopic enumeration. Heterotrophic plate counts have been performed following the French standard and results are expressed in CFU (Colony Forming Units) per ml; the DNA collected after filtration of 500 ml to 1500 ml of water on a 0. 2 µm pore size membrane was estimated using a fluorimetric method, as proposed by Mc COY and OLSON (1985); direct enumerations were performed by epifluorescence microscopy after acridine orange staining (AODC) following the procedure proposed by HOBBIE et al. (1977), the comparison between plate counts and AODC (fig. 1) shows the important underestimation of the bacterial numbers when estimated by the CFU (up to 3 orders of magnitude). Such discrepancy has already been observed in natural aquatic ecosystems and is usually explained by the presence of numerous dead cells enumerated by microscopy. Now, it seems that the difference between, plate counts and direct counts may rather be explained by the presence in water of « viable but non culturable » bacteria. A comparison between DNA estimation and direct counts have also been performed. Figure 2 shows the results of this comparison. In spite of the dispersion, the correlation between both methods is significant and the correlation straight line indicates an average DNA content per bacteria of 4. 1 x 10 - 15 g DNA in good accordance with the values quoted in the literature. The dispersion of the data around this average can be explained by various ways : the variability of DNA per cell content for the different bacterial strains present in the water samples, the precision of the DNA method which is not higher than 20 % and possible contamination by other organisms than bacteria, as flagellates or ciliates, which are retained on the 0. 2 µm pore size membrane. On the basis of these tests, it seems that the direct count by epifluorescence microscopy is the most adapted method for studying the bacterial regrowth in distribution system. The understanding of bacterial dynamics in a distribution system requires measurements of bacterial activity. Various methods have been developed in order to estimate bacterial activity in natural aquatic ecosystems. They are primarily based on the use of radioactive tracers. At the present time, the tritiated thymidine incorporation method, which measures the replication of bacterial DNA, is the most usually used one, but the incorporation of tritiated leucine into proteins, which measures increase in bacterial biomass, seems to be also an interesting method. These methods have been selected, on one hand, because of their specificity towards bacteria and, on the other hand, because of their high sensibility which is required for measurements of bacterial activity in the conditions of drinking water. Up to now, these methods have never been applied to drinking water. We have modified the experimental procedure of both methods : incubation time, radioactive tracers concentrations and volume of the sample have been tested and adapted in order to allow measurement in the conditions of drinking water samples. For thymidine incorporation, the volume of sample, incubated during 20 hours in the presence of 20 nM concentration of 3 H-thymidine, was 100 ml. The incorporation was measured in the DNA, using the biochemical procedure proposed by WICKS and ROBARTS (1977), rather than in the total macromolecules. For leucine incorporation, we measured the incorporation rate at four leucine concentrations (2, 27, 52, 77 nM : 2 nM of 3 H-leucine + non radioactive leucine) in 25 ml samples and the incubation lasted 3 to 4 hours. The incorporation rate was calculated as the reciprocal of the angular coefficient of the correlation straight fine obtained when the reciprocal of the fraction of leucine incorporated per hour was plotted against leucine concentration (fig. 3). Comparison of both methods on samples of drinking is presented at figure 4, a good linear correlation was found. The equation of the correlation straigth line is :log [Inc. leu (pmol/l. h) ] = 0, 97 log [Inc. thy (pmol/l. h) ] + 1. 35 (n = 69, r = 0. 84) The molar ratio between leucine and thymidine incorporation found in these samples (20 to 25) seems to be in good agreement with the usual conversion factors found for both methods in natural aquatic ecosystems. Bath methods seem to be available to bacterial activity estimations in drinking water, the triatiated thymidine incorporation method which requires working with only one concentration of radioactive tracer seems easier to use...|$|E
