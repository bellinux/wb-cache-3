5|$|The {{earliest}} independent {{styles to}} emerge were Yoseikan Aikido, begun by Minoru Mochizuki in 1931, Yoshinkan Aikido, founded by Gozo Shioda in 1955, and Shodokan Aikido, founded by Kenji Tomiki in 1967. The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death {{and did not}} cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique <b>rule-based</b> competition that some felt was contrary {{to the spirit of}} aikido.|$|E
5|$|It {{is largely}} an {{empirical}} procedure, {{and has a}} reasonable safety record {{within the scope of}} its intended application. Advantages are reduced overall decompression time and for some versions, easy estimation of decompression by the use of a simple <b>rule-based</b> procedure which can be done underwater by the diver. It requires the use of specific gas mixtures for given depth ranges. The advantages claimed are flexibility in that if the depth is not known accurately, the schedule can be adjusted during the dive to allow for the actual depth, and that it allows deep dives without the use of an expensive trimix dive computer.|$|E
5|$|The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are {{standards}} and interpretations {{developed by the}} International Accounting Standards Board, which are principle-based. IFRS are used by over 115 countries or areas including the European Union, Australia, and Hong Kong. The United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting, is largely <b>rule-based.</b> Critics have stated that the rules-based GAAP is {{partly responsible for the}} number of scandals that the United States has suffered. The principles-based approach to monitoring requires more professional judgment than the rules-based approach.|$|E

25|$|Prolog is well-suited for {{specific}} tasks that benefit from <b>rule-based</b> logical queries such as searching databases, voice control systems, and filling templates.|$|E
25|$|Some particle-based {{simulation}} packages use an ad-hoc formalism for {{specification of}} reactants, parameters and rules. Others can read files in a recognised <b>rule-based</b> specification format such as BNGL.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>rule-based</b> {{specification}} methods exist. In general, the {{specification of}} a model is a separate task from {{the execution of the}} simulation. Therefore, among the existing <b>rule-based</b> model specification systems, some concentrate on model specification only, allowing the user to then export the specified model into a dedicated simulation engine. However, many solutions to the specification problem also contain a method of interpreting the specified model. This is done by providing a method to simulate the model or a method to convert it into a form {{that can be used for}} simulations in other programs.|$|E
25|$|The Computational Representational Understanding of Mind (CRUM) {{is another}} attempt at {{modeling}} human cognition through simulated processes like acquired <b>rule-based</b> systems {{in decision making}} and the manipulation of visual representations in decision making.|$|E
25|$|Prova {{provides}} native syntax {{integration with}} Java, agent messaging and reaction rules. Prova positions {{itself as a}} <b>rule-based</b> scripting (RBS) system for middleware. The language breaks new ground in combining imperative and declarative programming.|$|E
25|$|Thus, by only {{considering}} {{states and}} features important for a particular reaction, <b>rule-based</b> model specification eliminates the need to explicitly enumerate every possible molecular state that can undergo a similar reaction, and thereby allows for efficient specification.|$|E
25|$|Others {{have criticized}} the SEC for taking an overly <b>rule-based</b> and enforcement-focused {{approach}} to regulation, rather than an approach that emphasizes industry-wide safety and learning and thus ensures {{the reliability of the}} national securities trading system.|$|E
25|$|Schematron is a {{language}} for making assertions {{about the presence}} or absence of patterns in an XML document. It typically uses XPath expressions. Schematron is now a standard (Part 3: <b>Rule-based</b> validation of ISO/IEC 19757 - DSDL).|$|E
25|$|There {{are major}} {{differences}} between the grammars just listed. In this regard, the dependency relation is compatible with other major tenets of theories of grammar. Thus like constituency grammars, dependency grammars can be mono- or multistratal, representational or derivational, construction- or <b>rule-based.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Tabular Islamic {{calendar}} is a <b>rule-based</b> {{variation of}} the Islamic calendar, in which months are worked out by arithmetic rules rather than by observation or astronomical calculation. It has a 30-year cycle with 11 leap years of 355 days and 19 years of 354 days. In the long term, it is accurate to one day in about 2,500 years. It also deviates up to about {{one or two days}} in the short term.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>rule-based</b> {{specification}} {{systems and}} their associated network generation and simulation tools {{have been designed}} to accommodate spatial heterogeneity, in order to allow for the realistic simulation of interactions within biological compartments. For instance, the Simmune project includes a spatial component: Users can specify their multi-state biomolecules and interactions within membranes or compartments of arbitrary shape. The reaction volume is then divided into interfacing voxels, and a separate reaction network generated for each of these subvolumes.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, the {{structure}} of sentiments and topics is fairly complex. Also, the problem of sentiment analysis is non-monotonic in respect to sentence extension and stop-word substitution (compare THEY would not let my dog stay in this hotel vs I would not let my dog stay in this hotel). To address this issue a number of <b>rule-based</b> and reasoning-based approaches have been applied to sentiment analysis, including defeasible logic programming. Also, there is a number of tree traversal rules applied to syntactic parse tree to extract the topicality of sentiment in open domain setting.|$|E
25|$|Kriegsman {{has been}} writing and porting {{open-source}} software for 30 years. He founded and ran pioneering software companies, including Document.com, later acquired by Merrill, and Clearway Technologies, acquired by Mirror Image Internet. After college, Kriegsman worked for Cognitive Systems, Inc. (started by notable AI researcher Roger Schank), developing large scale <b>rule-based,</b> statistical, and text-processing AI systems. He later integrated those three technologies in a paper he wrote for IEEE. Designing document management systems at Interleaf led him to found his first startup, Document.com. After founding Clearway, Kriegsman was a senior developer at @stake, which was later acquired by Symantec.|$|E
25|$|It is easy {{to imagine}} a {{biological}} system where some components are complex multi-state molecules, whereas others have few possible states (or even just one) and exist in large numbers. A hybrid approach has been proposed to model such systems: Within the Hybrid Particle/Population (HPP) framework, the user can specify a <b>rule-based</b> model, but can designate some species to be treated as populations (rather than particles) in the subsequent simulation. This method combines the computational advantages of particle-based modeling for multi-state systems with relatively low molecule numbers and of population-based modeling for systems with high molecule numbers and a small number of possible states. Specification of HPP models is supported by BioNetGen, and simulations can be performed with NFSim.|$|E
25|$|Language {{documentation}} combines anthropological inquiry (into {{the history}} and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. Lexicography involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a dictionary. Computational linguistics {{is concerned with the}} statistical or <b>rule-based</b> modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of translation and interpretation, as well as in language education – the teaching of a second or foreign language. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} science, graphs {{are used}} to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. For instance, the link structure of a website can be represented by a directed graph, in which the vertices represent web pages and directed edges represent links from one page to another. A similar approach {{can be taken to}} problems in social media, travel, biology, computer chip design, and many other fields. The development of algorithms to handle graphs is therefore of major interest in computer science. The transformation of graphs is often formalized and represented by graph rewrite systems. Complementary to graph transformation systems focusing on <b>rule-based</b> in-memory manipulation of graphs are graph databases geared towards transaction-safe, persistent storing and querying of graph-structured data.|$|E
25|$|At the {{simplest}} level, most well-known lunar calendars {{are based on}} the initial approximation that 2 lunations last 59 days: a 30-day full month followed by a 29-day hollow month — but this is only roughly accurate, and eventually needs correction by using larger cycles, or the equivalent of leap days. Additionally, the synodic month does not fit easily into the year, which makes accurate, <b>rule-based</b> lunisolar calendars complicated. The most common solution to this problem is the Metonic cycle, which takes advantage of the fact that 235 lunations are approximately 19 tropical years (which add up to not quite 6940 days). However, a Metonic calendar will drift against the seasons by about 1 day every 200 years. Metonic calendars include the calendar used in the Antikythera Mechanism about 2000 years ago, and the Hebrew calendar.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't {{long before}} the frame {{communities}} and the <b>rule-based</b> researchers {{realized that there was}} synergy between their approaches. Frames were good for representing the real world, described as classes, subclasses, slots (data values) with various constraints on possible values. Rules were good for representing and utilizing complex logic such as the process to make a medical diagnosis. Integrated systems were developed that combined Frames and Rules. One of the most powerful and well known was the 1983 Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE) from Intellicorp. KEE had a complete rule engine with forward and backward chaining. It also had a complete frame based knowledge base with triggers, slots (data values), inheritance, and message passing. Although message passing originated in the object-oriented community rather than AI it was quickly embraced by AI researchers as well in environments such as KEE and in the operating systems for Lisp machines from Symbolics, Xerox, and Texas Instruments.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the traditional understanding of law (see the separate entry on law), the sociology of law does not normally view and define the law only as a system of rules, doctrine and decisions, which exist independently of the society out of which it has emerged. The <b>rule-based</b> aspect of law is, admittedly, important, but provides an inadequate basis for describing, analysing and understanding law in its societal context. Thus, legal sociology regards law {{as a set of}} institutional practices which have evolved over time and developed in relation to, and through interaction with, cultural, economic and socio-political structures and institutions. As a modern social system, law does strive to gain and retain its autonomy to function independently of other social institutions and systems such as religion, polity and economy. Yet, it remains historically and functionally linked to these other institutions. Thus, one of the objectives of the sociology of law remains to devise empirical methodologies capable of describing and explaining modern law's interdependence with other social institutions.|$|E
500|$|While {{recognising}} bureaucracy as {{the most}} efficient form of organisation and even indispensable for the modern state, Weber also {{saw it as a}} threat to individual freedoms and the ongoing bureaucratisation as leading to a [...] "polar night of icy darkness", in which increasing rationalisation of human life traps individuals in the aforementioned [...] "iron cage" [...] of bureaucratic, <b>rule-based,</b> rational control. In order to counteract bureaucrats, the system needs entrepreneurs and politicians.|$|E
500|$|Qapital {{is a free}} {{personal}} finance app for iOS and Android devices, intended to encourage its users to save money. Qapital directs each of its users to set savings goals, then automatically transfers money from their checking account to an account for savings, when a rule established in the app is met. It uses the [...] "if this then that" [...] (IFTT) <b>rule-based</b> web-service. For example, one rule could be that if a user purchases a cup of coffee, then the app will round up the charge to the nearest dollar and deposit the difference into savings. Users connect their bank accounts to Qapital, so it knows when purchases are made. When a rule is met, money for savings are transferred to a Qapital account operated in partnership with Lincoln Savings Bank.|$|E
500|$|A single hyphen {{is used to}} {{indicate}} a compound. What constitutes a compound is controversial, with some authors equating it to a [...] "word" [...] in English, and others not willing to limit it to the English concept of a word. Examples from POJ include [...] "forty", [...] "circus", and [...] "recover (from illness)". The <b>rule-based</b> sandhi behaviour of tones in compounds {{has not yet been}} clearly defined by linguists. A double hyphen [...] is used when POJ is deployed as an orthography (rather than as a transcription system) {{to indicate}} that the following syllable should be pronounced in the neutral tone. It also marks to the reader that the preceding syllable does not undergo tone sandhi, as it would were the following syllable non-neutral. Morphemes following a double hyphen are often (but not always) grammatical function words.|$|E
500|$|Denning {{writes that}} the real {{challenge}} is keeping up with technological change, and in this sense, scientific management was the key American technological advance in the 20th century. It allowed American companies to provide large numbers of jobs to semi-skilled workers through supply-chain management, hierarchies, and <b>rule-based</b> systems. Businesses must now adjust to well-informed consumers who disdain profiteering and wish to be [...] "delighted". A related challenge is shifting from managing semi-skilled to knowledge workers. The Economist contrasted the [...] "Great Stagnation" [...] thesis with the [...] "Great Divergence" [...] which traces the pay gap to an increasing demand for skilled workers. Timothy Noah, writing in Slate, did not share Cowen's optimism {{about the future of}} American educational attainment on the basis that President Obama [...] "is getting tough" [...] on teachers' unions. There have been many reforms implemented in the last thirty years that the unions initially opposed, and the United States has poorer outcomes than many OECD countries with stronger unions. Noah reminds us that the earlier authors were optimistic about increased third level enrollment and that has since fallen as have graduation rates. The United States remains significantly behind other advanced countries in educational outcomes offering a perverse hope for improvement.|$|E
