25|$|In any {{of these}} designs an observer, rather than seeing a {{continuous}} weak light, sees a brighter light during short time intervals. These instants of bright light are arranged to create a light characteristic or, pattern specific to a lighthouse. For example, the Scheveningen Lighthouse flashes are alternately 2.5 and 7.5seconds. Some lights have sectors of a particular color (usually formed by colored panes in the lantern) to distinguish safe water areas from dangerous shoals. Modern lighthouses often have unique reflectors or <b>Racon</b> transponders so the radar signature of the light is also unique.|$|E
25|$|Lady Isle {{is home to}} an {{interesting}} lighthouse. Established in 1903 the lighthouse is not the standard round tower type but rather consists of a platform built on buttresses with an exterior stairwell. The light is still used as a navigational aid (Fl(4)30s19m8M) and is managed by the Northern Lighthouse Board. An X/S Band <b>racon</b> radar beacon, with S Band emissions restricted to landward {{is also on the}} lighthouse. A small wooden storage hut sits beside the lighthouse, rather oddly inscribed Social Security Appeals Tribunal. A large white horizontal cylinder used to hold the gas supply for the lighthouse light which was converted to electricity during the refurbishment and solarisation in around 2004. Regarding the approach to the island, mariners have to beware the drying rock all around the island up to 2 cables to the northeast (see the map).|$|E
50|$|Their {{characteristics}} are {{defined in the}} ITU-R Recommendation M.824, Technical Parameters of Radar Beacons (RACONS). <b>Racons</b> usually operate on the 9320 MHz to 9500 MHz marine radar band (X-band), and most also operate on the 2920 MHz to 3100 MHz marine radar band (S-band). Modern <b>racons</b> are frequency-agile; they have a wide-band receiver that detects the incoming radar pulse, tunes the transmitter and responds with a 25 microsecond long signal within 700 nanoseconds.|$|R

40|$|Poster presentado en la 4 th International Conference on Medical Geology GEOMED celebrada en Bari (Italia) del 20 al 25 de septiembre de 2011 The {{presence}} of abuse drugs in surface waters of rivers, lakes, marsh, etc are indicatives of human activity, and may denote a lack in the purification of urban wastewaters. In some cases, found levels of these substances {{can be used}} for estimation of the population¿s consume. Drugs of abuse are excreted mainly as metabolites through human waste, and only traces or small quantities can be found unaltered in soils and waters. Due to the limited number of research studies in this field, there is scarce understanding of the environmental occurrence, transport and fate for these compounds and it is also not known the effects of the permanent exposure of aquatic organisms to these toxics. Coastal marshes {{are one of the most}} important Mediterranean type ecosystems, which have suffered during the last decades an important demotion due to the intensification of agriculture and the construction of infrastructures. Pego-Oliva marsh is a good example of that. For this reason we selected this area, of approx. 1, 290 ha, to assess the levels of drugs of abuse through the analysis of twenty-three water samples taken in this wetland. A previously developed analytical method for the simultaneous determination of 14 drugs of abuse and their metabolites in surface waters, using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was utilized. Several isotope-labelled internal standards were included in the method as a way to compensate the matrix effects, for a better quantification. Ectasy, amphetamine, metamphetamine, MDA, ketamine, THC-COOH (the main metabolite of the THC), cocaine and their main metabolites (benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester), methadone, morphine and 6 -acetylmorphine were found at concentrations in the range of 0. 2 ng/L until 20. 4 µg/L. It was impossible to establish an origin of the drugs or the levels of consumption in the population of the surrounding areas due to that the marsh receive waters from different sources like Gallinera, Molineel, Bullent and <b>Racons</b> rivers, which could bring contaminated waters from long distances, as well as the {{presence of}} springs.
