40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the expression {{pattern of the}} predominant gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plasma membrane transporter GAT- 1 in Old World monkey (Macaca mulatta) and human retina. METHODS: GAT- 1 was localized in retinal sections by using immunohistochemical techniques with fluorescence and confocal microscopy. Double-labeling studies were performed with the GAT- 1 antibody using antibodies to GABA, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and the bipolar cell marker Mab 115 A 10.

M and P cells were morphologically {{similar to those}} found in Old- and New-World primates. Measurements were performed on well-stained cells from 4 retinas of different animals. We analyzed separate mosaics for inner and outer M and P cells at increasing distances from the fovea (2. 5 - 9 mm of eccentricity) to estimate cell density, proportion, and dendritic coverage. M cell density decreased towards the retinal periphery in all quadrants. M cell density was higher in the nasal quadrant than in other <b>retinal</b> <b>regions</b> at similar eccentricities, reaching about 740 cells/mm 2 at 2. 5 mm of temporal eccentricity, and representing 8 - 14 % of all ganglion cells.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} regional cone dysfunction in {{retinitis pigmentosa}} (RP) by recording focal electroretinograms (FERGs) {{from the central}} and paracentral <b>retinal</b> <b>regions</b> and to correlate the FERG with perimetric sensitivity losses. METHODS: Twenty-three typical patients with RP (age, 18 - 65 years; visual acuity, 20 / 100 to 20 / 20; kinetic visual field by size II/ 4 e, 20 - 40 degrees) and eight age-matched control subjects were evaluated. FERGs were recorded in response to either a central (eccentricity, 0 - 2. 25 degrees) or a paracentral annular (2. 25 - 9 degrees) field, presented on a light-adapting background. Fields' luminances (mean: 80 cd/m(2)) were sinusoidally modulated at different temporal frequencies (TFs; 10. 3, 14, 21, 32, 41, and 52 Hz). Amplitude and phase of the responses' fundamental harmonic (1 F) were measured. Perimetric sensitivity was measured by a visual field perimeter. For each patient, mean sensitivity losses were calculated for both the central (0 - 2. 25 degrees) and paracentral (2. 25 - 9 degrees) regions. RESULTS: On average, central and paracentral FERGs of patients with RP were reduced in amplitude (P </= 0. 05) compared with control values. Amplitude losses tended to be smaller in the central than the paracentral region and were limited to low-medium TFs (10. 3 - 14 Hz). Paracentral losses were rather invariant with TF. Paracentrally, but not centrally, the FERG phase in patients was delayed on average (P < 0. 01), compared with control values. The central FERG phase was delayed only in patients with visual acuities less than 20 / 40. In individual patients, paracentral 41 -Hz amplitude losses were positively correlated with corresponding perimetric losses (r = 0. 7, P < 0. 005). Both central and paracentral 41 -Hz amplitudes displayed high specificity (87. 5 % and 100 %, respectively) with relatively low sensitivity (46. 6 % and 63. 6 %, respectively) in predicting perimetric results in corresponding <b>retinal</b> <b>regions.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In RP, central and paracentral FERGs are differently altered {{as a function of}} TF, indicating regional differences in the stage and/or pathophysiology of retinal cone dysfunction.

40|$|Inherited {{photoreceptor}} degenerations (IPDs) are {{the most}} genetically heterogeneous of Mendelian diseases. Many IPDs exhibit substantial phenotypic variability, but the basis is usually unknown. Mutations in MERTK cause recessive IPD phenotypes associated with the RP 38 locus. We have identified a murine genetic modifier of Mertk-associated photoreceptor degeneration, the C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) allele of which acts as a suppressor. Photoreceptors degenerate rapidly in Mertk-deficient animals homozygous for the 129 P 2 /Ola (129) modifier allele, whereas animals heterozygous for B 6 and 129 modifier alleles exhibit an unusual intermixing of degenerating and preserved <b>retinal</b> <b>regions,</b> with females more severely affected than males. Mertk-deficient mice homozygous for the B 6 modifier allele display degeneration only in the far periphery, even at 8 months of age, and have improved retinal function compared to animals homozygous for the 129 allele. We genetically mapped the modifier to an approximately 2 -megabase critical interval that includes Tyro 3, a paralog of Mertk. Tyro 3 expression in the outer retina varies with modifier genotype in a manner characteristic of a cis-acting expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), with the B 6 allele conferring an approximately three-fold higher expression level. Loss of Tyro 3 function accelerates the pace of photoreceptor degeneration in Mertk knockout mice, and TYRO 3 protein is more abundant in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) adjacent to preserved central <b>retinal</b> <b>regions</b> of Mertk knockout mice homozygous for the B 6 modifier allele. Endogenous human TYRO 3 protein co-localizes with nascent photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagosomes in a primary RPE cell culture assay, and expression of murine Tyro 3 in cultured cells stimulates phagocytic ingestion of POS. Our findings demonstrate that Tyro 3 gene dosage modulates Mertk-associated retinal degeneration, provide strong evidence for a direct role for TYRO 3 in RPE phagocytosis, and suggest that an eQTL can modify a recessive IPD...|$|R
40|$|Eye {{movements}} and visual attention are intimately related. The major function of saccadic eye movements {{is to move}} objects of interest into the fovea, the <b>retinal</b> <b>region</b> of highest acuity, for close inspection during the following fixation (Findlay & Gilchrist, 2003).

40|$|Hereditary retinal {{diseases}} (HRDs) are heterogeneous disorders {{that cause}} incurable visual loss mainly {{due to the}} dysfunction or degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptor cells in the retina. Although a wide and sometimes overlap-ping spectrum of phenotypes exists, HRDs that mainly affect photoreceptors and/or RPE cells can be roughly divided into three main categories based on the predominant cell type affected and the pattern of disease progression: rod-domi-nated diseases in which pronounced, widespread rod photo-receptor loss precedes cone involvement (retinitis pigmentosa [RP], {{the most common form}} of inherited retinal degen-eration, classically follows this pattern), cone-dominated diseases with more pronounced cone photoreceptor loss, and regional degeneration in which a specific <b>retinal</b> <b>region</b> (e. g., the macula) is affected.

A cell-based immunoisolated intraocular drug delivery device for continuous GDNF release was designed. The photoreceptor rescuing effects in a rat model with inherited retinal degeneration were examined after the implantation of the gel device. METHODS: HEK 293 cells that overexpress GDNF were encapsulated in a composite matrix constituted of 2 mg/ml collagen and 1 % alginate. The collagen-alginate gel device was intravitreally injected into Royal College of Surgeons rats on post-natal day 28 (P 28). Rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham, un-operated, vehicle control, and treatment groups. Vitreous contents were collected for GDNF content assessment on P 35 and P 42. Enucleation was carried out on P 56 for histological evaluations. H&E stained paraffin sections of the retina were examined for the degree of morphological rescue via quantifying the outer nuclear layer photoreceptors at various <b>retinal</b> <b>regions.</b> RESULTS: Significant amount of GDNF was released into the vitreous after 7 and 14 days of device implantation. Outer nuclear layer (ONL) linings in the treatment group were better aligned at the central <b>retinal</b> <b>regions</b> when compared to the control groups. Increase in mean ONL cell counts were observed across the whole retina, in particularly, the center of the inferior retina. CONCLUSIONS: Cell growth, proliferation and sustained release of GDNF were achieved through implanting the cell-encapsulating collagen-alginate gel device, resulting in morphological rescue of photoreceptor cells in vivo.

However, as morphological structures and layering in health {{as well as their}} alterations in disease are complex, segmentation procedures have not yet reached a satisfactory level of performance. Therefore, raw images and qualitative data are commonly used in clinical and scientific reports. Here, we assess the value of OCT reflectivity profiles as a basis for a quantitative characterization of the retinal status in a cross-species comparative study. Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), confocal Scanning-Laser Ophthalmoscopy (SLO), and Fluorescein Angiography (FA) were performed in mice (Mus musculus), gerbils (Gerbillus perpadillus), and cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) using the Heidelberg Engineering Spectralis system, and additional SLOs and FAs were obtained with the HRA I (same manufacturer). Reflectivity profiles were extracted from 8 -bit greyscale OCT images using the ImageJ software package ([URL] profiles obtained from OCT scans of all three animal species correlated well with ex vivo histomorphometric data. Each of the retinal layers showed a typical pattern that varied in relative size and degree of reflectivity across species. In general, plexiform layers showed a higher level of reflectivity than nuclear layers. A comparison of reflectivity profiles from specialized <b>retinal</b> <b>regions</b> (e. g. visual streak in gerbils, fovea in non-human primates) with respective regions of human retina revealed multiple similarities. In a model of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), the value of reflectivity profiles for the follow-up of therapeutic interventions was demonstrated. OCT reflectivity profiles provide a detailed, quantitative description of retinal layers and structures including specialized <b>retinal</b> <b>regions.</b> Our results highlight the potential of this approach in the long-term follow-up of therapeutic strategies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe morphology, fine {{structure}} and spectral sensitivity of retinal photoreceptors of two anchovy species were investigated using light and electron microscopy and microspectrophotometry. Distinct regional specialisation of cones was observed. Long and short (bilobed) cones {{were observed in}} the horizontal retinal belt, including the nasal and temporal retinal zones. Only triple cones with two long lateral components, one small central component were observed in the dorsal and ventro-nasal <b>retinal</b> <b>regions.</b> The long cones presented various lamellar organisation patterns: (1) in parallel along the cell axis in the central retina, (2) oriented transversely {{at the base of}} the outer segment, and (3) tilted longitudinally while extending to the tip of the cone in the retinal periphery. In the short cones, the lamellae were always oriented along the cell axis, and their planes were perpendicular to the lamellae in the long cones, providing a structural basis for the detection of polarisation of incident light. The lamellae in all the outer segments of the triple cones are arranged perpendicular to the long cell axis. In both species, the long and short cones from the ventro-temporal retina were slender and more densely packed, and the outer segments of the long cones lay far more sclerad compared with the outer segments of the bifid cones. Microspectrophotometry revealed that in both species the lateral components of the triple cones displayed a maximum absorbance wavelength (Œªmax) of approximately 502 nm, while the short central components were more shortwave sensitive (Œªmax= 475 nm). The Œªmax of all long and short cones in the ventro-temporal zone was 492 nm, compared to 502 nm in other <b>retinal</b> <b>regions.</b> Anchovies are unique among vertebrates in that they contain clear structural basis for both colour and polarisation vision in the same retina...|$|R
