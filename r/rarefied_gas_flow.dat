40|$|Rooted {{from the}} gas kinetics, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a {{powerful}} tool in modeling hydrodynamics. In the past decade, it has been extended to simulate <b>rarefied</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flows</b> beyond the Navier-Stokes level, either by using the high-order Gauss-Hermite quadrature, or by introducing the relaxation time that {{is a function of}} the gas-wall distance. While the former method, with a limited number of discrete velocities (e. g. ~D 2 Q 36), is accurate up to the early transition flow regime, the latter method (especially the multiple relaxation time (MRT) LBM), with the same discrete velocities as that used in simulating hydrodynamics (i. e. ~D 2 Q 9), is accurate up to the free-molecular flow regime in the planar Poiseuille flow. This is quite astonishing in the sense that less discrete velocities are more accurate. {In this paper, by solving the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook kinetic equation accurately via the discrete velocity method, we find that the high-order Gauss-Hermite quadrature can not describe the large variation in the velocity distribution function when the rarefaction effect is strong, but the MRT-LBM can capture the flow velocity well because it is equivalent to solving the Navier-Stokes equations with an effective shear viscosity. Since the MRT-LBM has only been validated in simple channel flows, and for complex geometries it is difficult to find the effective viscosity, it is necessary to assess its performance for the simulation of <b>rarefied</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flows.</b> } Our numerical simulations based on the accurate discrete velocity method suggest that the accuracy of the MRT-LBM is reduced significantly in the simulation of <b>rarefied</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flows</b> through the rough surface and porous media. Our simulation results could serve as benchmarking cases for future development of the LBM for modeling and simulation of <b>rarefied</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flows</b> in complex geometries...|$|R

Extensive literature review of research work on the dynamic stability of rectangular panels in <b>rarefied</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> conditions indicated the lack of published reports dealing with this phenomenon. A recently completed preliminary study for NASA JSC dealing with the mathematical analysis of the stability of two-degree-of-freedom elastically supported rigid panels under the effect of <b>rarefied</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> was reviewed. A test plan outline is prepared {{for the purpose of}} conducting a series of experiments on four rectangular rigid test articles in a vacuum chamber under the effect of continuous and pulsating Nitrogen jet plumes.

The hardware required careful design to select a very lightweight material while satisfying rigidity and frequency requirements within the constraints of the test environment. The data to be obtained from the vacuum chamber tests can be compared with the predicted behavior of the theoretical two-degree-of-freedom model.

The primary objective is to investigate the existence of Knudsen minimum in microchannels of varying cross sections. The effect of geometrical cross section and fluid properties on the Knudsen minimum are also investigated by performing experiments on three divergence angles (4 degrees, 8 degrees, and 12 degrees) and three different gases (argon, nitrogen, and oxygen) to prove the robustness of the result. The Knudsen minimum, {{which is one of the}} characteristic features of rarefied flows, is experimentally observed for the first time in a microchannel of varying cross section.

An {{accurate}} and direct algorithm for solving the semiclassical Boltzmann equation with relaxation time approximation in phase space is presented for parallel treatment of <b>rarefied</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flows</b> of particles of three statistics. The discrete ordinate method is first applied to discretize the velocity {{space of the}} distribution function to render a set of scalar conservation laws with source term. The high order weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme is then implemented to capture the time evolution of the discretized velocity distribution function in physical space and time. The method is developed for two space dimensions and implemented on gas particles that obey the Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Computational examples in one- and two-dimensional initial value problems of <b>rarefied</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flows</b> are presented and the results indicating good resolution of the main flow features can be achieved.

The model has been applied to rarefied shear-driven and pressure-driven flows between parallel plates at Knudsen numbers between 0. 01 and 1.
