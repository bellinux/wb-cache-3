50|$|The {{construction}} of the building can be explained with stone masonry and <b>rough</b> <b>plaster</b> cover. Later on second floor was added with concrete slabs and brick walls. The later addition part was constructed with cast iron columns and steel profiled points on top of it.|$|R
50|$|The Chapel {{was built}} in the early 1950s and is {{dedicated}} to the Saint who so inspired Springvale School’s first headmaster, Canon Robert Grinham. It is built of brick, <b>rough</b> <b>plastered</b> and white painted; its internal pillars are gum poles, as are the beams which support the thatched roof.|$|R
50|$|Voysey {{designed}} {{every detail}} of his houses, including the furniture. His houses were inspired by English vernacular sources of the 16th and early 17th centuries, featuring white roughcast walls with horizontal ribbon windows and huge pitched roofs, and used <b>rough</b> <b>plaster,</b> slate and other materials typical of English farmhouses.|$|R

50|$|Although {{built in}} two stages, the {{internal}} finish to the newer section mirrors {{that of the}} first. The interior features silky oak joinery, parquetry floors, <b>rough</b> <b>plaster</b> finish on the walls to picture-rail height, plaster ceilings and cornices employing a variety of decorative mouldings, and leadlighted fanlights above doorways and in the arches of the central corridor.|$|R

It is built of brick, <b>rough</b> <b>plastered</b> and white painted; its internal pillars are gum poles, as are the beams which support the thatched roof. It is a simple building; a no-nonsense expression of the Christian faith.|$|R
50|$|Low-rise buildings, {{generally}} only single-storied are {{a peculiar}} characteristic of Qatari Architecture. This {{is in keeping}} with regional planning principles and then available local materials such as bamboo, mud (soil) and palm fond (leaves of the date palm tree). All buildings in this market are <b>rough</b> <b>plastered</b> and small openings face the streets (generally faced a courtyard in former residential buildings). Wind towers were used in residential buildings and one such property exists {{at one end of the}} market.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} hall {{is an impressive}} double volume with the marble finish of the portico carried through to the stair treads, skirtings and the internal masonry faces of the window wall. The floor has a glass mosaic finish in a simple two-tone grid pattern with a ceramic tile skirting. The walls generally have a <b>rough</b> <b>plaster</b> and paint finish. The ceiling, as {{for most of the}} building, is made up of gypsum plaster panels with acoustic perforations.|$|R
50|$|The east wing {{contains}} {{the kitchen and}} a woodshed. It has seven-foot (7 ft) plaster ceilings with walls finished in <b>rough</b> <b>plaster.</b> On the east wall is an early 19th-century cooking fireplace and baking oven with wooden Federal style mantel. The oven is behind two wooden doors. The doors have narrow casings with beaded Federal style backbands. There is a small pantry in the northeast corner. The woodshed, on the east, has an earthen floor below the kitchen's floor level.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a solid}} {{crash of}} {{released}} waters leaping upon the wheel more furiously than ever, a grinding of cogs, a hum like the hum of a hornet, and then the unvisited darkness of the old mill was scattered by intolerable white light. It threw up every cobweb, every burl and knot in the beams and the floor; till the shadows behind the flakes of <b>rough</b> <b>plaster</b> on the wall lay clear-cut as shadows of mountains on the photographed moon.|$|R

A doorway is visible in the <b>rough</b> <b>plaster</b> wall {{providing}} access to the pulpit. Framed pictures and a cross hang on the wall beside the pulpit. A placard fixed to the font of the pulpit reads "From this pulpit in 1800 [?], Father Arrojo[?] preached the Gospel to Indians in 13 [?] Indian dialects. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{influence}} of Le Corbusier may be discerned in the <b>rough</b> <b>plastered</b> concrete work, exposed concrete beams {{and the way}} the interior is dramatized by light brought into the building by high windows. Precedents may be seen at both Ronchamp and Sainte Marie de La Tourette. Care is taken to clearly express the junctions of different materials by negative detailing and the projection of beams past their point of support. The use of diagonal symmetry, gridded planning and modular dimensions all relate the building to both high modernism and classical architecture.|$|R
60|$|The {{walls of}} this {{upper end of}} the hall, as far as the dais extended, were covered with hangings or curtains, and upon the floor there was a carpet, both of which were adorned with some {{attempts}} at tapestry, or embroidery, executed with brilliant or rather gaudy colouring. Over the lower range of table, the roof, as we have noticed, had no covering; the <b>rough</b> <b>plastered</b> walls were left bare, and the rude earthen floor was uncarpeted; the board was uncovered by a cloth, and rude massive benches supplied the place of chairs.|$|R
2500|$|Originally, {{the hotel}} lobby resembled the 16th century Palazzo Farnese {{courtyard}} in Rome, Italy. To reach the skylight lit lobby, guests would enter from L Street through hand-painted decorated main doors and pass through [...] "a colonnade of <b>rough</b> <b>plastered</b> walls covered with gold beneath tints of blue". Optionally, the guest could travel straight from the entry doors, across the lobby, {{to the far end}} of the lobby and climb one of two winding staircases to reach a balcony floor extending around and overlooking the lobby. The stair stick spindles lining the stairway sides were pastel paint shaded ornamental ironworks.|$|R

50|$|The Konak Pier is a pier in the Turkish city of İzmir. It was {{designed}} in 1890 by the famous French architect and construction engineer Gustave Eiffel, {{to function as}} a customs building. It was built close to historical Konak Square and adds significant value to the area even now. The building was constructed with stone masonry and covered with <b>rough</b> <b>plaster.</b> For the roof design wood trusses were added. Even though {{it was meant to be}} a customs building, its function changed several times. In 1960 it started {{to function as a}} fish market. With the restructuring efforts in 2003-2004, Konak Pier gain its current look and function as upmarket shopping center.|$|R
50|$|The first European settler on {{the island}} was Robert Thomson, who {{established}} a modest farm for hay production, {{as well as a}} salt collection enterprise. In August 1838, a Corporal Welch was sent to Rottnest with 10 aboriginal prisoners. The following year, Thomson had his whaleboat stolen, supposedly by several of the inmates, and after complaints, Governor John Hutt decided to resume all land grants previously made {{on the island}}. Henry Vincent, a gaoler at the Fremantle prison was subsequently sent to the island as its first superintendent. Vincent went on to personally build or oversee the construction of many of the buildings listed. Building materials were mostly locally quarried limestone as well as timber from the local pine (callitris preissii) and featured distinctive <b>rough</b> <b>plastered</b> walls.|$|R
50|$|Painting of the Sittanvasal Caves were {{analysed}} {{to establish}} the technique and the material used to make the. Analysing {{a painting of a}} lotus pond in the ardhamantpam, it has been inferred that they are made with Fresco-secco, techniques made over rough stone using <b>rough</b> <b>plaster</b> of 2.5 mm thickness made of lime mortar and sand with minor impurities, applying 0.5 mm thick lime wash of fine lime water when the <b>rough</b> lime <b>plaster</b> is still <b>rough.</b> The pigments used are composed of white made from lime, black made from wood charcoal or lamp black, yellow from yellow ochre, red from red ochre, blue from ultramarine\lapis lazuli, and green from terre verte. Pigments of permanent mineral colours (not vegetable colours as reported on the display plaque at the site by ASI) were applied over dry plaster surfaces without any adhesive grove; the process involved a chemical reaction of lime water which absorbed oxygenin the air and getting converted by a carbonisation process into insoluble calcium carbonate, which enabled the pigments to adhere to the surface. At the initiative of Pudukkottai State, during 1937-39, the paintings were cleaned, and then given a preservative coating. Also, the damaged portions of the plastering were injected with cementing material and the paintings were also retouched.|$|R
50|$|The three {{interconnected}} {{houses at}} the corner of the Striftstraße and Prinz-Christians-Weg were built in 1904 according to plans by Joseph Maria Olbrich. The corner house (with pilaster strips made of bricks) and the “Blue House” (the ground floor is covered with blue-glazed tiles) were erected to be sold, while the “Grey House”, also known as the “Preacher House”, (which has a dark <b>rough</b> <b>plaster</b> surface) was designed as a residence for the court preacher. Olbrich designed the interior of the Grey House; Paul Haustein and Johann Vincenz Cissarz were responsible for the décor of the Blue House and some rooms of the corner house. The three houses were intended to demonstrate living possibilities for the middle classes. They were heavily damaged in World War II. The Grey House made way for a new construction, while the other two were reconstructed with serious modifications.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile, on {{a little}} rise of ground near the road, {{neighbor}} Gammons and John Bowers were building our next home. It did {{not in the least}} resemble the foundation of an everlasting family seat, but it deeply excited us all. It was of pine and had the usual three rooms below and a long garret above and as it stood on a plain, bare to the winds, my father took the precaution of lining it with brick to hold it down. It was as good as most of the dwellings round about us but it stood naked on the sod, devoid of grace as a dry goods box. Its walls were <b>rough</b> <b>plaster,</b> its floor of white pine, its furniture poor, scanty and worn. There was a little picture {{on the face of the}} clock, a chromo on the wall, and a printed portrait of General Grant--nothing more. It was home by reason of my mother's brave and cheery presence, and the prattle of Jessie's clear voice filled it with music. Dear child,--with her it was always spring! ...|$|R

50|$|The {{architecture}} of Roma mirrors its sister city of Ciudad Mier on the Mexican {{side of the}} river, as well as Guerrero Viejo upriver. Roma is notable for its buildings of river sandstone, caliche limestone and molded brick, using rejoneado (patterned large and small stones) and sillar (stone laid in an ashlar pattern) masonry techniques. Both methods employ an outer finish of <b>rough</b> lime <b>plaster</b> detailed with bands of smooth colored plaster, characteristic of northern Mexico.|$|R
60|$|SCENE--CURTIS JAYSON'S study. On the left, forward, a gun rack {{in which}} are {{displayed}} several varieties of rifles and shotguns. Farther back, three windows looking {{out on the}} garden. In the rear wall, an open fireplace with two leather arm-chairs in front of it. To right of fireplace, a door leading into the living-room. In the far right corner, another chair. In the right wall, three windows looking out on the lawn and garden. On this side, front, a typewriting table with machine and chair. Opposite the windows on the right, a bulky leather couch, facing front. In front of the windows on the left, a long table with stacks of paper piled here and there on it, reference books, etc. On the left of table, a swivel chair. Gray oak bookcases are built into the cream <b>rough</b> <b>plaster</b> walls which are otherwise almost hidden from view by a collection {{of all sorts of}} hunter's trophies, animal heads of all kinds. The floor is covered with animal skins--tiger, polar bear, leopard, lion, etc. Skins are also thrown over the backs of the chairs. The sections of the bookcase not occupied by scientific volumes have been turned into a specimen case for all sorts of zoological, geological, anthropological oddities.|$|R
50|$|Deep blue {{face brick}} with white {{recessed}} horizontal joints forms {{the wall of}} the basement garage which is entered at the northwest corner of the site. Pale blue balcony recesses, fawn squaring on the parapets, and the wire mesh parapets are white. The south wall is pale blue with white window frames. The entrance porch is in a deep plum colour on a <b>rough</b> textured <b>plaster</b> on which the name of the building in white lettering is fixed. The squared panel is grey, doors are white and the floor black.|$|R
50|$|In three coat {{plastering}} it {{is standard}} {{to apply a}} second layer in the same fashion, leaving about a half inch of <b>rough,</b> sandy <b>plaster</b> (called a brown coat or browning (UK)). A smooth, white finish coat goes on last. After the plaster is completely dry, the walls are ready to be painted. In this article's photo ("lath seen from the back...") the curls of plaster are called keys and are necessary to keep the plaster on the lath. Traditional lime based mortar/plaster often incorporates horsehair which reinforces the plasterwork, thereby helping to prevent the keys from breaking away.|$|R

6000|$|For {{a purpose}} {{such as this}} the cellar was well adapted. Its walls were loosely constructed, and had lately been {{plastered}} throughout with a <b>rough</b> <b>plaster,</b> which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from hardening. Moreover, {{in one of the}} walls was a projection, caused by a false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to resemble the red of the cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily displace the bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole up as before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious. And in this calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I easily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, with little trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood. Having procured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible precaution, I prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old, and with this I very carefully went over the new brickwork. When I had finished, I felt satisfied that all was right. The wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked around triumphantly, and said to myself--"Here at least, then, my labor has not been in vain." ...|$|R
5000|$|Farleigh {{appears in}} Domesday Book of 1086 as the manor of Ferlega. It {{was held by}} Robert de Wateville from Richard Fitz Gilbert (de Clare and de Tonbridge). Its domesday assets were: ½ hide; 2 ploughs, 1 ox, to its overlords per year {{rendering}} £3.

[...] The main façade and the corner, which is formed by geometric shapes, are ornamented with grotesques moulded in smooth plaster. The façade facing Pohjoinen Makasiininkatu is rhythmically pierced by bay windows. The roof is steeply pitched and again asymmetrical, with gables of varying heights; the architects' original reddish tiles have been replaced with copper.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly they {{mounted a}} large spiral {{staircase}} which filled {{the space of}} a round tower, and was lighted from the top by a lantern of rich, coloured glass on which were emblazoned the arms of the family. Then they entered the vestibule, an apartment spacious enough for a salon; which, however, was not fitted up in the Gothic style, but of which the painted ceiling, the gilded panels, and inlaid floor were more suitable to a French palace. The brilliant doors of this vestibule opened in many directions upon long suites of state chambers, which indeed merited the description of shells. They were nothing more; of many the flooring was not even laid down; the walls of all were <b>rough</b> and <b>plastered.</b>|$|R
60|$|My {{letter to}} Madam Esmond, announcing my revolt and disobedience (perhaps I myself {{was a little}} proud of the {{composition}} of that document), I showed in duplicate to Mr. Lambert, because I wished him to understand what my relations to my mother were, and how I was determined, whatever of threats or quarrels the future might bring, never for my own part to consider my separation from Theo as other than a forced one. Whenever I could see her again I would. My word given to her was in secula seculorum, or binding at least {{as long as my}} life should endure. I implied that the girl was similarly bound to me, and her poor father knew indeed as much. He might separate us; as he might give her a dose of poison, and the gentle, obedient creature would take it and die; but the death or separation would be his doing: let him answer them. Now he was tender about his children to weakness, and could not have the heart to submit any one of them--this one especially--to torture. We had tried to part: we could not. He had endeavoured to separate us: it was more than was in his power. The bars were up, but the young couple--the maid within and the knight without--were loving each other all the same. The wall was built, but Pyramus and Thisbe were whispering on either side. In the midst of all his grief and perplexity, Uncle Lambert had plenty of humour, and could not but see that his role was rather a sorry one. Light was beginning to show through that lime and <b>rough</b> <b>plaster</b> of the wall: the lovers were getting their hands through, then their heads through--indeed, it was wall's best business to retire.|$|R
