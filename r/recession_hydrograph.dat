40|$|A {{schematic}} representation of karst aquifers {{may be that}} of a high hydraulic conductivity channel network with kilometre-wide intervals, surrounded by a low hydraulic conductivity fractured limestone volume and connected to a local discharge area, the karst spring. The behaviour of the karst spring (hydrographs, chemical or isotopic composition, etc.) represents the global response of the karst aquifer to input events. The available data on karst aquifer hydraulic parameters are limited. Global response is therefore more easily obtained and is commonly used to make inferences on the recharge and groundwater flow processes, {{as well as on}} the hydraulic parameter fields. Direct verification of these interpretations is, obviously, very difficult. We have used an indirect method of verification, consisting of introducing well-defined theoretical karst structures into a finite element model and then analysing the simulated global response according to presently accepted interpretation schemes. As we know what we put into the numerical model, the validity of any interpretation may be checked. The first results indicate that some of the generally accepted interpretations are not necessarily true. In particular: (i) separation of simulated recession hydrographs into several components shows that different exponential components do not necessarily correspond to aquifer volumes with different hydraulic conductivities; (ii) non-exponential parts of recession hydrographs do not always give information about the infiltration process; and (iii) the recession coefficient of the baseflow (i. e. the last, nearly exponential part of the <b>recession</b> <b>hydrograph)</b> depends on the global configuration of the whole karst aquifer, not just on the hydraulic properties of the low hydraulic conductivity volumes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a rainfall-runoff simulation study, {{conducted in a}} laboratory to investigate surface runoff characteristics, verify unit hydrograph assumption and investigate {{the nature of the}} recession constant. A hydrology bench consisting of a metallic tray with an over head sprinkler system was used for this study. The metallic tray with soil bed and a river network acted as a small catchment. The over head sprinkler system consisting of spray nozzles acted as rainfall simulator. Different rainfall intensities and durations were taken as the treatments for the experiments. Surface runoff volume was collected at 10 secondly pulses of time in each experiment. Collected data were then processed and analyzed to explain the results. Unit hydrographs were developed from the surface runoff hydrographs for different rainfall durations and intensities. Recession constant K was calculated from the recession limb of each surface runoff hydrograph by optimization. Investigations show that runoff volume, runoff generation rate and peak runoff rate increase with the increasing rainfall duration. However, the peak runoff rate per sec of effective rainfall decreases with the increasing rainfall duration. There is also an evidence of the effects of rainfall intensity on runoff characteristics but no specific trend is identified. This study also reveals that the assumption of linearity between runoff volume and hydrograph ordinates is partially valid with some error which may be attributed to the non-uniform distributions of rainfall. Nature of recession constant suggests that the <b>recession</b> <b>hydrograph</b> is not only a function of catchment characteristics but also depends on rainfall intensities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{main purpose}} of this thesis was {{going to set up}} a {{hydrological}} model between the main watershed and sub-watershed in Guandaushi watershed where located in the middle of Taiwan, in order to estimate the stream flow of main watershed. The results were shown as follows: 1. According to the annual discharge and rainfall collected from 1996 to 1998, the average outflow rate in the sub-watershed was 35. 2 % and was 61. 4 % in the main watershed. The reason why the sub-watershed outflow rate less than the main watershed was that most of the precipitation percolated into the ground. 2. According to the collected 19 events of storms in the main watershed, the average hydrological response value was 15. 3 %;the range was 1. 4 %∼ 64. 3 %. The hydrological response value increased with the duration of storm. If the antecedent precipitation moistened the watershed damp, the rainfall of the storm would outflow more by runoff and made the hydrological response value increased with the duration of storm to show the higher flashiness. 3. According to the statistical analysis, the average lag time (TL) and the time to peak (Tp) of the sub-watershed were 1. 7 hours and 4. 8 hours but it took 1. 6 days and 3. 8 days in the main watershed which was 23 times of the TL and 19 times of the Tp in the sub-watershed. This showed that with the similar shape of these two watersheds, TL and Tp in the main watershed was shorter than the square times of watershed length ratio. The main watershed area was 47 times larger than the sub-watershed. TL and Tp in the main watershed were shorter in proportion to ratio of the area and the length of the stream. This might due to the average slope of the geography in the main watershed was steeper than that in the sub-watershed. 4. The regression analysis of rainfall and discharge flow on <b>recession</b> <b>hydrograph</b> in the main watershed, The result showed that rainfall did not have much influence on the <b>recession</b> <b>hydrograph.</b> Even if the extreme value of the discharge parameter was deleted,the regression analysis would showed that there was highly correlation between the maximum daily rainfall and runoff. However, we found that some rainfall events were over the threshold value, but there were no runoff occurred. This might be due to un-uniform rainfall distribution in space. 中 文 摘 要 本研究乃以台灣中部關刀溪森林集水區為試區，將位於試區西北側之一小集水區為對照區，藉由所設置之水文、氣象觀測設施與關刀溪集水區接近出口處之流量測定，來探討兩大小集水區之溪流量變化關係，期能建立一上、下游間集水區之相關模式，茲將分析結果摘要如下： 一、由年流量與年雨量之間的關係，推得 1996 ∼ 1998 年間子集水區之流出率平均為 35. 2 %，主流集水區則為 61. 4 %。子集水區流出率偏小的原因，可能係大部分之降水滲漏至地下所致。 二、由主流集水區 19 場暴雨事件所求得之水文反應值平均為 15. 3 %；最小者僅 1. 4 %，最大者為 64. 3 %；水文反應值有隨暴雨延時的增加而呈上昇之趨勢；且若前期降雨使集水區處於一較濕潤狀態，則暴雨雨量將以較多逕流量之形式流出，而使集水區之水文反應值隨著暴雨延時增加而增顯其高度之突現性。 三、由統計結果顯示，子集水區之平均稽延時間(TL) 及尖峰到達時間(Tp) 分別為 1. 7 hr及 4. 8 hr；主流集水區則分別為 1. 6 天及 3. 8 天，分別約為子集水區平均稽延時間之 23 倍與尖峰到達時間之 19 倍，顯示在兩集水區形狀相似之情況下，主流集水區之稽延時間與尖峰到達時間為略小於兩集水區最高點至出水口距離之比值之平方倍，而主流集水區面積約為子集水區面積之 47 倍，依此面積及溪流長度比例顯示主流集水區之尖峰到達時間及稽延時間較之子集水區均呈現較快之趨勢，此可能因主流集水區地形之平均坡度較子集水區為陡所致。 四、將主流集水區退水曲線上再度降雨之流量參數作一迴歸分析，顯示退水曲線之流量並非單純受降雨之影響。若將流量參數中 之極端值刪除，由迴歸分析顯示最大日雨量與直接逕流量雖具有顯著之相關性，但仍有部分降雨之雨量雖多卻未能成為直接逕流流出之情形，這可能係降雨之空間分佈不均所致。目 錄 頁次 表次……………………………………………………………… [...] .

40|$|Abstract. <b>Hydrograph</b> <b>recession</b> {{constants}} {{are required}} in rainfall-runoff models, base flow augmen-tation studies, geohydrologic investigations and in regional low-flow studies. The recession {{portion of a}} streamflow hydrograph is shown to be either an autoregressive process or an integrated moving average process, depending upon {{the structure of the}} assumed model errors. Six different estimators of the base flow recession constant are derived and tested using thousands of <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recessions</b> available at twenty-three sites in Massachusetts, U. S. When <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recessions</b> are treated as an autoregressive process, unconditional least squares or maximum likelihood estimators of the base-flow recession constant are shown to exhibit significant downward bias due to the short lengths of <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recessions.</b> The precision of estimates of <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recession</b> constants is shown to depend heavily upon assumptions regarding the structure of the model errors. In general, regression procedures for estimating <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recession</b> parameters are generally preferred to the time-series alternatives. An evaluation of the physical significance of estimates of the baseflow recession con-stant is provided by comparing regional regression models which relate low-flow statistics to three independent variables: drainage area, basin slope and the baseflow recession constant.

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] method of recession analysis proposed by Brutsaert and Nieber (1977) remains one of the few analytical tools for estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters at the field scale and beyond. In the method, the <b>recession</b> <b>hydrograph</b> is examined as −dQ/dt = f(Q), where Q is aquifer discharge and f is an arbitrary function. The observed function f is parameterized through analytical solutions to the one-dimensional Boussinesq equation for unconfined flow in a homogeneous and horizontal aquifer. While attractive in its simplicity, as originally presented it is not applicable to settings where slope is an important driver of flow, or where hydraulic parameters vary greatly with depth. We compare analytical solutions to the linearized one-dimensional Boussinesq equation for a sloping aquifer to numerical solutions of the full nonlinear equation. The behavior of the nonlinear Boussinesq equation is also assessed when the aquifer is heterogeneous wherein the lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity k varies as a power law with height z above the impermeable layer (k ∼ z[superscript n], n constant ≥ 0). All of the analytical solutions differ in key aspects from the nonlinear solution when plotted as −dQ/dt = f(Q) and thus are inappropriate for a Brutsaert and Nieber-type analysis. However, new analytical solutions for a sloping aquifer are derived “empirically” from the numerical simulations that are applicable during the late period of recession when the recession curve converges to −dQ/dt = aQ[superscript b], where b = (2 n + 1) /(n + 1) and a {{is a function of the}} dimensions and hydraulic properties of the aquifer...|$|E
40|$|Karst {{aquifers}} {{are often}} classified as highly heterogeneous systems. Such systems are very complex {{to assess and}} model due {{to the presence of}} discontinuous porosity, large spatial variability of hydraulic parameters and the difficulties encountered in establishing the fundamental spatial properties of the system. In fact, karst aquifers have been studied and classified into groups based on several methods such as chemograph analysis (monitoring water quality variations at springs), linear systems analysis (kernel functions and time moment analysis), heterogeneity ratio, <b>recession</b> <b>hydrograph</b> analysis and flashiness of an aquifer. All these methods have been reviewed, with emphasis on the fourth and fifth approaches because they are based on hydrograph analysis. The problem with these two methods is the fact that they do not take in account the duration time between the starting of the rising limb and the peak discharge and the duration time between rising limb and the returning to the baseflow condition. On these reasoning it may be argued that taking in consideration the whole hydrograph components (rising limb, peak and recession limb) could be used as bases to introduce a new parameter called Degree of karstification index (D k) Which then {{can be used as a}} measure of the karstifiaction of karst aquifers. Several sets of hydrograph data obtained from different springs have been analysed to determine values of (D k). The results have yielded values ranging from less than 10 where the aquifer is considered to be Darcian to more than 60 where the aquifer is assumed to be highly karstified. Application of such classification method may help to provide a basis for deciding whether to use Equivalent porous medium, fracture or conduit based models to simulate karst aquifers. ...|$|E

40|$|Compared to <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recession</b> analysis, {{which is}} widely applied in {{engineering}} hydrology, the {{quantitative assessment of}} stream salinity with time (i. e. the salinograph) has received significantly less attention. In particular, while in many previous hydrological studies an inverse relationship between hydrograph and salinograph responses is apparent, the concept of salinity accession (the inversely related salinity counterpart to <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recession)</b> has not been introduced nor quantitatively evaluated in previous literature. In this study, we conduct a mathematical analysis of salinograph accession, and determine new quantitative relationships between salinity accession and <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recession</b> parameters. An equation is formulated that reproduces the general trend in salinity accession. A salinity accession parameter kc is then introduced and is shown to be the ratio of direct runoff to total stream flow recession parameters: kr/k. The groundwater recession parameter kg was estimated using a simple and rapid method that uses both salinograph and hydrograph data. Salinity accession type-curves illustrate that under certain conditions, the relative steepness of individual salinographs is dependent upon the ratio of groundwater salinity to direct runoff salinity: Cg/Cr. The salinity accession algorithms are applied to two contrasting field settings: Scott Creek, South Australia and Sandy Creek, northern Queensland, Australia. It was found that kg > k during periods of obvious stream flow recession, for the events analysed. Salinograph accession behaviour was fairly similar for both sites, despite contrasting environments. Using assumed end-member salinities for groundwater and direct runoff based upon field observations, the behaviour of kc from the Scott Creek site was approximately reproduced by varying the initial groundwater to runoff flow ratio: Qg 0 /Qr 0, within reasonable parameter ranges. The use of salinograph information when used in addition to standard hydrograph analyses provided useful information on recession characteristics of stream components.

Determination {{of the actual}} magnitude of the hydrograph and duration of the inflow recession requires knowledge of the changes of seepage rates with surface head in the reservoirs. This thesis develops three independent methods of determining seepage under saturated flow conditions from stage recorder and pan evaporation records: the application of Darcy's Law; the application of extrapolated curves of storage decline versus pan evaporation to zero pan evaporation; {{and the application of}} a three dimensional regression model. It is felt that the Darcy method produces the most accurate results, and that the extrapolation method produces the least accurate results. The extrapolation method requires several averaging methods contributing to its inaccuracy.

Validation methods diered {{in the type of}} data used, in their target and in mode. The model was applied in the humid and mountainous Brugga catchment (40 km 2) in south-west Germany.

Although runo simulations were satisfying, inadequacies of the model structure compared with the real situation with regard to hydrological processes in the study area were found.

40|$|<b>Hydrograph</b> <b>recession</b> during dry periods {{has been}} used to {{construct}} water storage–discharge relationship, and to quantify storage dynamics and evaporation when streamflow data is available. However, variable hydrologic connectivity among hillslope-riparian-stream zones may affect the lumped storage–discharge relationship, and as a result, affect the estimation of evaporation and storage change. Given observations of rainfall and runoff, and remote sensing-based observation of evaporation, the ratio (α) between estimated daily evaporation from recession analysis and observed evaporation, and the ratio (β) between estimated contributing storage and total watershed storage are computed for 9 watersheds located in different climate regions. Both evaporation and storage change estimation from recession analysis are underestimated due to the effect of partial contributing storage, particularly when the discharge is low. It was found that the values of α decrease significantly during individual recession events, while the values of β are relatively stable during a recession event. The values of β are negatively correlated with the water table depth, and vary significantly among recession events.

40|$|International audienceAn {{analysis}} of <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recessions</b> {{can be used}} to identify the parameters of a conceptual catchment storage irnodel and, with the advent of large-scale digital data storage and automated logging systems, it has become desirable to automate recession curve analysis. Various studies have thus reported algorithms used to infer 'baseflow' storage models automatically from recession data. Such algorithms commonly operate by maximising the fit of measured recession data to some a priori function. Here, an alternative approach is taken in which the appropriate form for a catchment saturated zone store is investigated by combining observed recession data to form a Master Recession Curve (MRC). This is done within a software package that offers automated functions to help select recession periods suitable for inclusion within the MRC. These recession periods are combined automatically to form a "prototype" MRC, which can be modified interactively to overcome problems such as unrepresentative or sparse data. The master recession for a catchment is used to calculate an empirical catchment-averaged discharge-relative storage (Q?S) relationship. The method is considered to be general because the Q?S relationship may be of arbitrary form. Examples are given, showing the derivation for three catchments of different Q?S functions...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recessions</b> {{can be used}} to identify the parameters of a conceptual catchment storage irnodel and, with the advent of large-scale digital data storage and automated logging systems, it has become desirable to automate recession curve analysis. Various studies have thus reported algorithms used to infer 'baseflow' storage models automatically from recession data. Such algorithms commonly operate by maximising the fit of measured recession data to some a priori function. Here, an alternative approach is taken in which the appropriate form for a catchment saturated zone store is investigated by combining observed recession data to form a Master Recession Curve (MRC). This is done within a software package that offers automated functions to help select recession periods suitable for inclusion within the MRC. These recession periods are combined automatically to form a "prototype" MRC, which can be modified interactively to overcome problems such as unrepresentative or sparse data. The master recession for a catchment is used to calculate an empirical catchment-averaged discharge-relative storage (QΔS) relationship. The method is considered to be general because the QΔS relationship may be of arbitrary form. Examples are given, showing the derivation for three catchments of different QΔS functions...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aspiration}} {{behind this}} study was to calculate groundwater recession parameter using recently developed method and to apply calculated parameter for calculation of groundwater recharge. The equation for the <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recession</b> curve can be utilized to predict groundwater recharge during each recession period. The steps involved during recession curve analysis include selection of analytical expression, derivation of recession characteristic and optimization of the parameters. Each segment shows the outflow process which creates short-term or seasonal influence. The variations recession rate causes problems for derivation of recession characteristics. To avoid variations in recession parameters Short Time Fourier Transformation (STFT) was used. While applying STFT in real runoff data recession segments were chosen by user. The selected segments were further used for calculation of groundwater recharge assuming a linear hydrological model. The runoff hydrograph represents consist of three components: surface flow, intermediate flow and base flow. The applications of wavelet transformation can differential those flow components into were short, intermediate and long wavelet periods. The displacement method was used to obtain further information from wavelet transformation and to verify its practical application in groundwater studies.

40|$|Currently, {{sampling}} regimes rely on predetermined time or flow-weighted intervals {{at which}} to collect samples. During periods of high flow, such as storm events, automated samplers may {{run out of}} sample bottles {{before the end of}} the hydrograph, resulting in the loss of data and inaccurate load calculations. In this research, real-time monitoring sensor networks with automated samplers were used to monitor the flowrate in agricultural tile-drains and ditches. By characterizing site specific hydrographs, a model was developed that enabled the datalogger to create storm-specific sampling regimes, resulting in approximately 20 samples for each storm event that resulted in a significant hydrograph. The model uses a power-law relationship for defining each <b>hydrograph’s</b> <b>recession</b> curve and spaces sampling events at flow-weighted intervals over the expected recession. The model’s performance was found to be satisfactory when either average or best-fit values of the two model parameters were used to predict the recession curves. The average error in the cumulative flow represented by each recession sample in the six hydrographs analyzed was less than 10 %. The use of this model to create a storm-specific sampling regime eliminated the uncertainty in determining the flow-weighted sampling interval and led to the optimal usage of the sample bottles available in the automated sampler. ...|$|R
40|$|Separation of streamflow {{components}} into quickflow and baseflow {{is usually}} {{carried out in}} two main ways: <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recession</b> analysis and tracer-based methods. In this paper, it is proposed to use a fully coupled surface and subsurface flow and transport model {{to gain a better}} understanding of the relationship between physical catchment characteristics (e. g. aquifer hydraulic conductivity) and hydrological response (e. g. stream salinity and flow response) to a rainfall event. This enables an evaluation of the common empirical approaches of recession analysis and baseflow separation in practice. This is achieved by conducting a range of numerical experiments on a hypothetical case study, which is based on a commonly used surface water-groundwater interaction benchmarking problem. A fully coupled, variably saturated surface-subsurface flow and transport model (HydroGeoSphere) forms the basis of the numerical experiments conducted in this investigation. The results indicate that the empirical baseflow separation algorithms failed to reproduce the simulated groundwater discharge to the stream from the theoretical catchment, although it was identified that the surface-subsurface benchmark problem needs to be further developed to produce more realistic hydrograph behaviour before a proper comparison between the two approaches can be made.

40|$|<b>Hydrograph</b> <b>recessions</b> from {{rainfall}} {{events have}} previously been analyzed for discharge at springs and streams; however, relatively little quantitative {{research has been}} conducted with regard to <b>hydrograph</b> analysis of <b>recessions</b> from monitoring wells screened in karst aquifers. In previous work a quantitative hydrography analysis technique has been proposed born which matrix transmissivity (i. e., transmissivity of intergranular porosity) and specific yields of matrix, fracture, and conduit components of the aquifer may be determined from well hydrography. The technique has yielded realistic results at three sites tested by the authors thus far (Y- 12, Oak Ridge, TN; Crane, IN, and Ft. Campbell, KY). Observed field data, as well as theoretical considerations, show that karst well hydrography are valid indicators of hydraulic properties of the associated karst aquifers. Results show matrix transmissivity (T) values to be in good agreement with values calculated using more traditional parameter estimation techniques such as aquifer pumping tests and slug tests in matrix dominated wells. While the hydrograph analysis technique shows promise for obtaining reliable estimates of karst aquifer T with a simple, relatively inexpensive and passive method, the utility of the technique is limited in its application depending on site-specific hydrologic conditions, which include shallow, submerged conduit systems located in areas with sufficient rainfall for water levels to respond to precipitation events...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a method for}} characterizing flow systems in karst aquifers by acquiring quantitative information about the geometric and hydraulic parameters of a karst conduit network from spring hydrograph analysis. The investigation method applied consisted of constructing simple conceptual models of karst systems, and deducing analytical formulae describing the connection between aquifer parameters and <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recession</b> coefficient. The resulting formulae were then applied for evaluating input parameters for numerical models of the Bure aquifer (Jura, Switzerland). The comparison between model simulation results and real-world data permitted to test {{the applicability of the}} analytical formulae. The Bure test site also provided as a basis for evaluating some general characteristics of conduit networks by steady-state numerical models. Analytical formulae identified two, significantly different flow domains, depending on the overall configuration of aquifer parameters. During the baseflow recession of mature karst systems, the conductivity of karst conduits does not influence the drainage of the low-permeability matrix. In this case the drainage process is influenced by the size and hydraulic parameters of the low-permeability blocks alone. This flow condition has been defined as matrix-restrained flow regime (MRFR). During the baseflow recession of premature karst systems and the flood recession of mature systems, the recession process is dependent not only on the hydraulic parameters {{and the size of the}} low-permeability blocks, but also on conduit condu...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to identify the transport pathways of pesticides from a sloped litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) orchard to a nearby stream based on a three-component hydrograph separation (baseflow, interflow, surface runoff). Dissolved silica and electrical conductivity were chosen as representative tracers. During the study period (30 d), 0. 4 and 0. 01 % of the applied mass of atrazine and chlorpyrifos, respectively, were detected in the stream after 151 mm of rainfall. Baseflow (80 – 96 %) was the dominant hydrological flow component, followed by interflow (3 – 18 %) and surface runoff (1 – 7 %). Despite its small contribution to total discharge, surface runoff was the dominant atrazine transport pathway during the first days after application because pesticide concentrations in the surface runoff flow component declined quickly within several days. Preferential transport with interflow became the dominant pathway of atrazine. Because chlorpyrifos was detected in the stream water only twice, it {{was not included in}} the hydrograph separation. A feature of the surface runoff pathway was the coincidence of pesticide and discharge peaks. In contrast, peak concentrations of pesticides transported by interflow occurred during the <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recession</b> phases. Stormflow generation and pesticide transport depended on antecedent rainfall. The combination of high-resolution pesticide concentration measurements with a three-component hydrograph separation has been shown to be a suitable method to identify pesticide transport pathways under tropical conditions...|$|R

The following characteristics were evaluated: (1) the influence of the SM loss at mid-depths (20 cm) on <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recession,</b> (2) the influence of moisture loss from deeper portions of the soil (50 cm) on late-season baseflow and (3) the timing of this transition. Thirty-four pairings were used between SNOTEL sites and nearby stream gauges in select locations throughout Utah, for 3 – 5 years each depending on data quality, to generate 143 total comparisons of soil moisture loss and stream discharge. Regressions were fairly strong (r 2 3 ̆e 0. 8) where the SNOTEL site was in a location with slow meltout rates, ample infiltration and minimal summer precipitation. In a few cases, the correlation was remarkably strong (r 2 3 ̆e 0. 95), even for SNOTEL sites located far from respective stream gauges (e. g. 3 ̆e 30 -km, 3 ̆e 1000 -m elevation difference for the best pairing). At such sites, transition timing in 2013 (between predominantly 20 - vs 50 -cm SM loss) was well predicted from 2012 data given the similarity in water years, with discharges at the transition point less than 30...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} {{of water resources}} in Ireland prior to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) has focussed on surface water and groundwater as separate entities. A critical element to the successful implementation of the WFD is to improve our understanding of the interaction between the two and flow mechanisms by which groundwaters discharge to surface waters. An improved understanding of the contribution of groundwater to surface water is required for the classification of groundwater body status and the determination of groundwater quality thresholds. The results of the study will also have a wider application to many areas of the WFD. A subcommittee of the WFD Groundwater Working Group (GWWG) has been formed to develop a methodology to estimate the groundwater contribution to Irish Rivers. The group has selected a number of analytical techniques to quantify components of stream flow in an Irish context (Master <b>Recession</b> Curve, Unit <b>Hydrograph,</b> Flood Studies Report methodologies and hydrogeological analytical modelling). The components of stream flow that can be identified include deep groundwater, intermediate and overland. These analyses have been tested on seven pilot catchments that have a variety of hydrogeological settings and have been used to inform and constrain a mathematical model.

40|$|TOPMODEL rainfall-runoff hydrologic {{concepts}} {{are based on}} soil saturation processes, where soil controls on <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recession</b> have been represented by linear, exponential, and power function decay with soil depth. Although these decay formulations have been incorporated into baseflow decay and topographic index computations, only the linear and exponential forms have been incorporated into infiltration subroutines. This study develops a power function formulation of the Green and Ampt infiltration equation for the case where the power n D 1 and 2. This new function was created to represent field measurements in the New York City, USA, Ward Pound Ridge drinking water supply area, and provide support for similar sites reported by other researchers. Derivation of the power-function-based Green and Ampt model begins with the Green and Ampt formulation used by Beven in deriving an exponential decay model. Differences between the linear, exponential, and power function infiltration scenarios {{are sensitive to the}} relative difference between rainfall rates and hydraulic conductivity. Using a low-frequency 30 min design storm with 4 Ð 8 cm h 1 rain, the n D 2 power function formulation allows for a faster decay of infiltration and more rapid generation of runoff. Infiltration excess runoff is rare in most forested watersheds, and advantages of the power function infiltration routine may primarily include replication of field-observed processes in urbanized areas and numerical consistency with power function decay of baseflow and topographic index distributions.

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{catchment}} behaviour during recession periods {{is better}} identifiable {{than in other}} periods, the representation of <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recession</b> is often weak in hydrological simulations. Among the various aspects that influence model performance during low flows, {{in this paper we}} concentrate on those more inherently related to the modelling, such as the development of a suitable model conceptualization, and the choice of an appropriate calibration strategy. In this context we develop a methodology where the calibration procedure is combined with an iterative process of model improvement, to obtain an optimal model configuration that performs well both during low flows and high flows. The methodology starts by calculating a synthetic master recession curve that represents the long-term recession of a given catchment. Subsequently, using a simple reservoir model, we determine the storage-discharge relation that simulates the slow hydrograph component. This relation is determined without making any a-priori assumption on its form and is inferred from discharge data available through an iterative process. Next, high flow related parameters are recalibrated separately, to avoid that the simulation of low discharges is neglected in favour of a higher performance in simulating peak discharges. This methodology is applied on several catchments in Luxembourg, and as a result we determined that in all catchments except one (where human interference is high) within the chosen model structure a linear reservoir describes best the observed groundwater behaviour. This result is used to trigger a discussion as to the general suitability of the use of a linear groundwater reservoir in hydrological modelling...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{evaluation}} {{of the performance of}} a physically-based distributed model of a small Mediterranean mountain catchment is presented. This was carried out using hydrological response data, including measurements of runoff, soil moisture, phreatic surface level and actual evapotranspiration. A-priori model parameterisation was based as far as possible on property data measured in the catchment. Limited model calibration was required to identify an appropriate value for terms controlling water loss to a deeper regional aquifer. The model provided good results for an initial calibration period, when judged in terms of catchment discharge. However, model performance for runoff declined substantially when evaluated against a consecutive, rather drier, period of data. Evaluation against other catchment responses allowed identification of the problems responsible for the observed lack of model robustness in flow simulation. In particular, it was shown that an incorrect parameterisation of the soil water model was preventing adequate representation of drainage from soils during <b>hydrograph</b> <b>recessions.</b> This excess moisture was then being removed via an overestimation of evapotranspiration. It also appeared that the model underestimated canopy interception. The results presented here suggest that model evaluation against catchment scale variables summarising its water balance can be of great use in identifying problems with model parameterisation, even for distributed models. Evaluation using spatially distributed data yielded less useful information on model performance, owing to the relative sparseness of data points, and problems of mismatch of scale between the measurement and the model grid.
