H 2 recorded {{for a variety of}} equivalence ratios at a firing rate of 10 kW. The present numerical study suggests that there is a critical momentum rate of the inlet fuel−air mixture below which the MILD combustion cannot occur. Also, it is revealed, both experimentally and numerically, that, above the critical rate, both the inlet fuel−air mixedness and momentum rate impose insignificant influence on the stability of and emissions from the MILD combustion.

40|$|Moderate or Intense Low Oxygen Dilution (MILD) {{combustion}} {{technology has}} been identified as an innovative approach to reducing combustion generated pollutants and increasing thermal efficiency. The present experimental study investigates the performance and operation characteristics of a parallel jet MILD combustion furnace using pulverized coal as the fuel. Kingston brown coal and Bowen basin anthracite coal with particle size in the range of 38 - 180 μm was injected into the furnace using CO 2 as a carrier gas. It was found that MILD conditions are achievable for coal particles without additional pre-heating of the air. Measurements of in-furnace combustion gas concentration of CO and NO, exhaust gas emissions, and furnace temperatures are presented. The in-furnace combustion data are analyzed to better understand the combustion characteristics of coal under the MILD condition in a <b>recuperative</b> <b>furnace.</b> High CO concentration was recorded at lower portion of the furnace for brown coal. It was also found that for the same equivalence ratio (φ = 0. 88) the NO emission dropped to 45 % for brown coal in comparison to that measured for anthracite coal. M. Saha, B. B. Dally, P. R.

40|$|In this {{experimental}} work, a laboratory-scale <b>recuperative</b> <b>furnace</b> {{has been}} used to investigate the sustainability of Moderate or Intense Low Oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion with pulverised coal. Low-rank and high volatile Kingston brown coal and high-rank and low volatile Bowen Basin black coal with particle size in the range of 38 - 180 μm were injected into the furnace using either CO 2 or N 2 as a carrier gas. Operating conditions for stable MILD combustion of pulverised coal have been identified and evidencing MILD condition is achievable without any additional pre-heating of the air. The O 2 and CO emissions were measured in parallel with NO emission. A water cooled sampling probe was used to conduct in-furnace gas sampling. Measurements of in-furnace gas concentration of CO and NO and in-furnace temperatures are presented. It was found that a significant reduction of NO emission owing to the strong NO reburning reaction inside the furnace. These findings, together with the potentiality of MILD conditions for soot depression and destruction, open the possibility of using high rank black and low rank brown coal with this technology. M.

40|$|The CO system {{makes it}} {{possible}} to reduce operating costs to a minimum. It combines the advantages of both a <b>recuperative</b> melting <b>furnace</b> and an oxygen melting furnace. Exact analysis of the requests and the situation of the furnace operator is vital for calculating the combination of the CO-System in order to obtain the optimum cost of operation and design. ...|$|R

The EC {{is part of}} an Integrated Operation and Control System, whose hierarchical architecture is also described, and is divided in two sub-systems, a Fault Detection System, and a Process Optimisation System (POS). The POS architecture and operation, detailed in this paper, is based on a Genetic Algorithm, for solution search, and a learning algorithm, based on fuzzy set theory, to interpolate a cost function, which quantifies one of the objectives...|$|R
40|$|Since present {{conventional}} {{glass melting}} furnaces have reached their technological limits {{both in terms}} of energy usage and emission, a number of add-on systems have been developed for regenerative and <b>recuperative</b> <b>furnaces</b> in recent years to minimize NO_x emissions and the energy consumption of these conventional furnaces by means of already known primary and secondary measures, the modification of these measures and their combination. The individual components of a glass melting furnace have been designed, coordinated, optimized and developed further for this R and D project in order to develop one of the largest melting furnaces for container glass and to install a trend-setting prototypical full scale unit for the first time which now represents the third generation of a well-known and proven glass melting furnace type. Since glass melting furnaces are a very complex system, many of their parameters cannot be simply applied from one scale to the next so that certain specific tasks had to be redefined, resimulated, retraced and resolved by means of physical model tests and corresponding mathematical computer calculations in order to achieve the aim of this R and D project and to reduce the economic risks with the implementation of the development results. The primary environmental technology involved in the standard LoNOx"c"i"r"c"l"e"d"R Melter does not require any external add-on systems and so the furnace compaign can be extended and savings are achieved in both material and labour costs which will finally result in a lower final unit cost of glass produced. The consequent accomplishment of the primary measures of the LoNOx "t"r"a"d"e"m"a"r"k Melter proved that this full scale unit is consistently capable of achieving specific emission levels of 500 mg NO_x/Nm" 3 dry waste gas, converted to 8 % oxygen, a value subjected to the dynamic clause.

40|$|The {{effects of}} fuel mixture on the {{establishment}} of moderate and intense low oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion in a <b>recuperative</b> <b>furnace</b> were investigated. Experimental as well as computational results are presented in this paper. Data from exhaust sampling of NOx and thermocouple measurements of temperature are reported along with results from simultaneous measurement of temperature and OH using Rayleigh scattering and laser induced predissociation fluorescence, respectively. A variety of fuel mixtures using methane, ethylene, and propane were investigated. It was found that dilution of fuel with CO 2 or N 2 reduced the NOx emission and made the flame inside the furnace invisible. This dilution caused the stoichiometric mixture fraction to shift toward the rich side where the scalar dissipation is highest. This implies that premixing of the fuel stream with circulated exhaust gases can have beneficial effects on {{the establishment of}} MILD combustion {{without the need for}} higher fuel jet momentum. The reaction zone was found to be characteristically broad and the temperature images were patchy in {{the lower part of the}} furnace. The probability density function of the temperature exhibited a bimodal behavior with a cross over temperature of 1300 K. B. B. Dally, E. Riesmeier and N. Peter...|$|E
40|$|The {{moderate}} or intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion {{regime is}} a promising technology that operates at high combustion efficiency and lessens pollutant emissions. This numerical {{study of a}} parallel jet <b>recuperative</b> MILD combustion <b>furnace</b> investigates the effects of coal particle size and inlet air momentum on furnace dynamics and global CO emissions. It is found that coal particle size affects the coal penetration depth within the furnace {{and the location of}} a particle stagnation point. The effects of air inlet momentum are tested in two ways, first by raising the inlet temperature at constant mass flow rate, and second by increasing the mass flow rate at constant temperature. In both cases, increasing the air jet momentum broadens the reaction zone and facilitates MILD combustion, but also increases CO emissions due to lowered reaction rates. Emmet M. Cleary, Paul R.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to determine the feasibility of applying gas reburn to glass tanks for NOx emissions control. Three model furnaces representing the main furnace types were evaluated: a 250 ton per day end port container glass furnace, a 500 ton per day side port flat glass furnace, and a 125 ton per day <b>recuperative</b> fiber glass <b>furnace.</b> The evaluation consisted of conceptual reburn system designs, a thermal analysis, an estimate of NOx removal achievable, and an economic analysis. It was found that NOx reductions {{on the order of}} 80 percent may be expected for the regenerative glass furnaces, and 65 percent for the recuperated furnace. The cost of control is estimated to be 25 to 33 {{percent of the cost of}} oxy-fuel. Potential complications are an estimated increase on the order of 200 graden F in gas temperatures throughout the regenerator and a decrease in fuel efficiency of up to 10 to 12. 4 percent...|$|R
