As in Sonnet 20, the beloved's beauty is compared to both a man's (Adonis) and a woman's (Helen).|$|E

For example, the zoo raises 40 varieties of bamboo for the pandas on long-term loan from China, and it maintains 18 varieties of eucalyptus trees to feed its koalas.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Soviet Union, the future of the breed seemed unclear since rich Russians {{interested}} in harness racing preferred the faster Russian and American trotters. Therefore, in 1997, the International Committee for the Protection of the Orlov Trotter was established. Purebred Orlov trotters are now raised on twelve stud farms in Russia and three in Ukraine. The studs in Russia have a total of about 800 mares, which <b>raises</b> <b>some</b> concern; it is a general rule that a horse breed with fewer than 1000 female individuals is in danger.|$|E

25|$|Although discontinued, this {{application}} {{is also one}} of the most concern to the general public. The vast majority of older pressure-treated wood was treated with CCA. CCA lumber is still in widespread use in many countries, and was heavily used during the latter half of the 20th century as a structural and outdoor building material. Although the use of CCA lumber was banned in many areas after studies showed that arsenic could leach out of the wood into the surrounding soil (from playground equipment, for instance), a risk is also presented by the burning of older CCA timber. The direct or indirect ingestion of wood ash from burnt CCA lumber has caused fatalities in animals and serious poisonings in humans; the lethal human dose is approximately 20grams of ash. Scrap CCA lumber from construction and demolition sites may be inadvertently used in commercial and domestic fires. Protocols for safe disposal of CCA lumber are not consistent throughout the world. Widespread landfill disposal of such timber <b>raises</b> <b>some</b> concern, but other studies have shown no arsenic contamination in the groundwater.|$|E
500|$|On 2 May 2007, mX, an {{afternoon}} newspaper in Brisbane, {{revealed that the}} defence team for Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley would be referring the song to Queensland Attorney-General Kerry Shine, due to concerns that the song's lyrics could prejudice the 2004 Palm Island death in custody, where Hurley had been charged for manslaughter. On 2 May Hurley's lawyer Glen Cranny said [...] "The content and proposed timing of the song’s release <b>raises</b> <b>some</b> serious concerns regarding Mr Hurley’s trial." [...] It was claimed by the defence team that the song's lyrics were similar to the events that took place surrounding the death of Mulrunji. The band's manager, Paul Piticco, conceded the song was about the case but insisted they were not specific enough to cause a problem.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Black Tears" [...] {{from the}} album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence {{originally}} had the lyric [...] "An island watchhouse bed, a black man's lying dead", which sparked fears {{that it might}} prejudice {{the trial of the}} former Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case. The band claimed that the song's lyrics primarily dealt with the climbing of Uluru by tourists despite requests from the Indigenous people of the area to respect their sacred sites and not climb. The original version of the song was retracted from the album, and replaced with an alternative version with the criticised material removed. The legal team for Hurley, who was charged with manslaughter over the death of Mulrunji in 2004, had referred the song to the Attorney-General of Queensland, Kerry Shine, in their attempt at altering the track. One of Hurley's lawyers, Glen Cranny, stated that [...] "the content and proposed timing of the song's release <b>raises</b> <b>some</b> serious concerns regarding Mr Hurley's trial". Powderfinger's band manager, Paul Piticco, stated that Fanning had confirmed that a line in the song was related to the case. However, he added that the lyric in question could refer to [...] "a watchhouse in The Bahamas or something".|$|E

Domestic and commercial activities pollute rivers and coastal waters as well. The report {{goes on to say that}} the best water quality is found at sites where stream systems filter water through healthy wetland environments, and at sites further away from settled areas and lined with larger riparian corridors. The worst water quality is normally located in streams that have little or no riparian zones and are heavily used for washing clothes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{story may}} be true, but if so, it <b>raises</b> <b>some</b> {{difficult}} questions. The boy {{would have been}} Alexander's only child born during his lifetime (Roxane's son was born posthumously). Even if Alexander had ignored him, which seems highly unlikely, the Macedonian Army and the successors would certainly have known of him, and would almost certainly have drawn him into the succession struggles which ensued upon Alexander's death. Yet we first hear of the boy twelve years after Alexander's death, when a boy was produced as a claimant to the throne. Especially since Alexander's own half brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (Philip II's illegitimate and physically and mentally disabled son) was Alexander's original successor [...] Alexander's illegitimate son would have had more rights to the throne than his illegitimate half-brother. Heracles played a brief part in the succession battles, and then disappeared. It seems {{more likely that the}} romance with Barsine was invented by the boy's backers to validate his parentage.|$|E

2500|$|Although Dwyer {{wished to}} {{purchase}} the Hamilton players, {{for a little while}} it seemed that Hamilton might remain in the NHL as Abso-Pure talked about building a new arena. The arena was not built and Dwyer bought the rights to the Tigers' players from Thompson for $75,000, and gave the players <b>raises,</b> <b>some</b> as high as 200% of their previous salary. Dwyer's team was for a time known as the [...] "New York Hamilton Tigers" [...] by the time it reached training camp, but this was changed to the New York Americans. [...] The Hamilton franchise was officially revoked at the September 22 league meeting in the same year, and the matter of the players' suspensions and fines dropped with little additional comment. Although Dwyer was ostensibly the owner, due to his underworld ties he was not publicly named by the NHL at the meeting announcing the team. Instead, Colonel Hammond of Madison Square Garden, Duggan, and former Ottawa manager Tommy Gorman were announced as the officers. [...] Although the Americans' roster was composed almost entirely of the former Tigers players, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary, the NHL does not consider the Americans to be a continuation of the Bulldogs/Tigers franchise.|$|E
2500|$|The first 19 {{chapters}} of the Grammar present key examples of ornament {{from a number of}} sources which were diverse both historically and geographically – notably examining the Middle East in the chapters on Arabian, Turkish, Moresque (Alhambra) and Persian ornament. The final chapter, titled 'Leaves and Flowers from Nature' acknowledges the underlying principle that dictates the design of ornament around the world, which is the form found in nature, [...] "in the best periods of art, all ornament was based upon an observation of the principles which regulate the arrangement of form in nature" [...] and that [...] "true art consists of idealising, and not copying, the forms of nature". Christopher Dresser, Owen Jones's best known protégé, contributed one of the plates in this final chapter, and he was concurrently presenting theories on natural-form ornament in his famous botanical lectures at the Government School of Design in the mid-1850s. This last chapter <b>raises</b> <b>some</b> critics about the inability to produce new ornamental design since repetition is a common factor among nature, and Jones describes this as [...] " [...] going back to nature like the ancients did" [...] but his own response to this issue evolves around the fact that nature has a great variety of line and form, and is based in geometry which gives an enormous amount of freedom to the designer to follow and idealize the form of nature as a basic element while creating something that society has never seen before.|$|E
