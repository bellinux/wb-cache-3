40|$|One {{possible}} {{function of}} the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is discrimination of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), spectral cues used for vertical sound localization. Recent psychophysical and physiological studies suggest that steep, <b>rising</b> spectral <b>edges</b> may be the features used to identify HRTFs. Here we showed, using notch noise and noise band stimuli presented over a range of frequencies, that a subclass of DCN type IV neurons responded with a response peak when the <b>rising</b> spectral <b>edge</b> of a notch or band was aligned near best frequency (BF). This edge sensitivity was correlated with weak or inhibited responses to broadband noise and inhibition in receptive fields at frequencies below BF. Some aspects of the inhibition shaping the response peak, namely inhibition to <b>rising</b> <b>edges</b> below BF and to falling edges at BF, {{could be explained by}} the properties of type II interneurons with BFs below those of the type IV neurons. However, many type IV neurons also showed inhibitory responses with the <b>rising</b> spectral <b>edge</b> just above BF, and these responses could not be reproduced by current models of DCN circuitry. Therefore, a new component of the DCN circuit is needed to fully explain the responses to <b>rising</b> spectral <b>edges.</b> This shaping of edge sensitivity by inhibition to <b>rising</b> spectral <b>edges</b> both below and above BF suggests the specialization of DCN for spectral edge coding along the tonotopic gradient.

2500|$|Synchronous {{dynamic random-access memory}} (SDRAM) is any dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) {{where the}} {{operation}} of its external pin interface is coordinated by an externally supplied clock signal. DRAM integrated circuits (ICs) produced from the early 1970s to mid-1990s used an asynchronous interface, in which input control signals have a direct effect on internal functions only delayed by the trip across its semiconductor pathways. SDRAM has a synchronous interface, whereby changes on control inputs are recognised after a <b>rising</b> <b>edge</b> of its clock input. [...] In SDRAM families standardized by JEDEC, the clock signal controls the stepping of an internal finite state machine that responds to incoming commands. These commands can be pipelined to improve performance, with previously started operations completing while new commands are received. The memory is divided into several equally sized but independent sections called banks, allowing the device to operate on a memory access commands in each bank simultaneously and speed access in an interleaved fashion. [...] This allows SDRAMs to achieve greater concurrency and higher data transfer rates than asynchronous DRAMs could.|$|E
2500|$|For a given load, sizing of a {{smoothing}} capacitor is a tradeoff between reducing ripple voltage and increasing ripple current. The peak current is {{set by the}} rate of rise of the supply voltage on the <b>rising</b> <b>edge</b> of the incoming sine-wave, reduced by {{the resistance of the}} transformer windings. [...] High ripple currents increase I2R losses (in the form of heat) in the capacitor, rectifier and transformer windings, and may exceed the ampacity of the components or VA rating of the transformer. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers specify the maximum capacitance of the input capacitor, and SS diode rectifiers also have current limitations. [...] Capacitors for this application need low ESR, or ripple current may overheat them. [...] To limit ripple voltage to a specified value the required capacitor size is proportional to the load current and inversely proportional to the supply frequency and the number of output peaks of the rectifier per input cycle. Full-wave rectified output requires a smaller capacitor because it is double the frequency of half-wave rectified output. [...] To reduce ripple to a satisfactory limit with just a single capacitor would often require a capacitor that's infeasibly large.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – We propose an {{efficient}} method to measure a pulse width using multiphase clock signals generated from a ring oscillator. These clocks, {{which have the}} same frequency and are evenly spaced, give multiple <b>rising</b> <b>edges</b> within a clock cycle. Thus, {{it is possible to}} measure a pulse width more accurately than with existing single clock-based methods. The proposed method is applied to a capacitive touch switch. Experimental results show that the capacitive touch switch with the proposed method gives a 118 fF resolution, which is 6. 4 times higher than that of the touch switch with a single clock-based pulse width measurement method...|$|R

40|$|A {{document}} discusses {{a component}} of a laser metrology system designed to measure displacements {{along the line of}} sight with precision on the order of a tenth the diameter of an atom. This component, the phasemeter, measures the relative phase of two electrical signals and transfers that information to a computer. Because the metrology system measures the differences between two optical paths, the phasemeter has two inputs, called measure and reference. The reference signal is nominally a perfect square wave with a 50 - percent duty cycle (though only <b>rising</b> <b>edges</b> are used). As the metrology system detects motion, the difference between the reference and measure signal phases is proportional to the displacement of the motion. The phasemeter, therefore, counts the elapsed time between <b>rising</b> <b>edges</b> in the two signals, and converts the time into an estimate of phase delay. The hardware consists of a circuit board that plugs into a COTS (commercial, off-the- shelf) Spartan-III FPGA (field-programmable gate array) evaluation board. It has two BNC inputs, (reference and measure), a CMOS logic chip to buffer the inputs, and an Ethernet jack for transmitting reduced-data to a PC. Two extra BNC connectors can be attached for future expandability, such as external synchronization. Each phasemeter handles one metrology channel. A bank of six phasemeters (and two zero-crossing detector cards) with an Ethernet switch can monitor the rigid body motion of an object. This device is smaller and cheaper than existing zero-crossing phasemeters. Also, because it uses Ethernet for communication with a computer, instead of a VME bridge, {{it is much easier to}} use.
