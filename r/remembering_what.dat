Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life.|$|E
25|$|Various {{studies have}} {{reported}} that 50-80% of all everyday memories are, at least in part, related to prospective memory. Prospective memory is crucial for normal functioning since people form future intentions and remember to carry out past intentions on a daily basis. Numerous aspects of daily life require prospective memory, ranging from ordinary activities such as remembering where to meet a friend, to more important tasks such as <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> time to take medication.|$|E

25|$|In the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure (PRVP), {{participants}} are informed {{that they will}} receive tasks to complete while watching a video on a television screen. They are given a response sheet in order to record details of the tasks when the appropriate cues appear in the video. A distractor task is given {{at a certain point}} in order to test for prospective memory. Titov and Knight (2001) used a PRVP with a video consisting of a pedestrian walking through a shopping district and required participants to make decisions on whether to buy certain items {{as if they were the}} pedestrian. Shopping requires many prospective memory intentions such as <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> items are needed and what items can be purchased another day.|$|E

She explained, [...] "But what happens is as soon as you put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E
