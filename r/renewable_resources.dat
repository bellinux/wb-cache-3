5|$|Jordan aims {{to benefit}} from its large uranium {{reserves}} with two nuclear plants, 1000 MW each, scheduled for completion in 2025. Natural gas was discovered in Jordan in 1987. The estimated size of the reserve discovered was about 230 billion cubic feet, a modest quantity compared with its other Arab neighbours. The Risha field, in the eastern desert beside the Iraqi border, produces nearly 35 million cubic feet of gas a day, which is sent to a nearby power plant to produce a minimal amount of Jordan's electricity needs. Jordan receives 330 days of sunshine per year, and wind speeds reach over 7m/s in the mountainous areas. King Abdullah inaugurated several large-scale projects like the 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm and the 53 MW Shams Ma'an Power Plant in the 2010s. In May 2017, {{it was announced that}} more than 200 MW of solar energy projects had been completed. The government has set a target to satisfy 20% of Jordan's electrical consumption with <b>renewable</b> <b>resources</b> by 2020, a total of around 1800 MW.|$|E

Sensitivity of aggressive strategies to the starting resource level suggests that improvement in <b>renewable</b> <b>resource</b> extraction can be attained by ensuring a healthy initial resource level.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an economic}} growth model {{of land use}} with capital accumulation and dynamics of <b>renewable</b> <b>resource.</b> The economy consists of the industrial, agricultural and <b>renewable</b> <b>resource</b> sectors and the land is distributed among housing, agricultural production and resource growth. The model synthesizes the main ideas in the Solow growth, the Ricardian two-sector economic model, and the logistic model in resource economics in a compact framework. With some specified values of the parameters, we demonstrate that the economic system has a unique equilibrium point. We also conduct comparative dynamic analysis with regard {{to changes in the}} industrial sector’s total productivity, the propensities to consume the resource, to consume housing and to save. For instance, our simulation result demonstrates that when the propensity to consume the <b>renewable</b> <b>resource</b> is increased, the land distribution is not affected; both the consumption level and price of the resource are increased; the resource sector increases its output and employs more labor and capital, but the stock of the resource falls over time; the total capital stock and the capital inputs to the agricultural and industrial sectors are reduced; the rate of interest is increased but the wage rate is reduced; less labor is employed by the industrial and agricultural sectors; and the land rent and the price of agricultural good are reduced. Our model also predicts some results different from the growth model with <b>renewable</b> <b>resource</b> by Eliasson and Turnovsky (2004). <b>renewable</b> <b>resource,</b> growth model, economic structure, housing, land distribution...|$|R

Although households know that the degree of own patience depends on its resource, we assume that households believe that they cannot control the motion of the aggregate <b>renewable</b> <b>resource.</b> This is because they think that their impact is negligible so that there exists an externality {{in the form of the}} patience of the households. Based on this framework, we analyze the dynamic character of the steady state and show that the equilibrium path may be indeterminate. We next examine the welfare effects of tax policies.
