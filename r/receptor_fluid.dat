40|$|Percutaneous {{absorption}} of 14 C-labeled benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was studied in five-day in vivo and in vitro experiments with female Sprague-Dawley rats following single topical doses of 9 - 10 &mu;g/cm 2. The in vivo percutaneous absorption {{was measured by}} the presence of 14 C radioactivity in urine, feces and tissues. In vitro percutaneous absorp-tion was measured with excised (non-viable) skin in Franz-type diffusion cells. Several modifications of standard diffusion cell techniques which are known to enhance the transport of lipophilic compounds were evaluated. In vitro penetration was determined by directly measuring the level of 14 C radioactivity in the receptorfluid. BaP was observed to readily penetrate in vivo with a total of 46. 2 % (n = 4, SD = 3. 4 %) of the applied dose being absorbed over five days. In in vitro experi-ments using a &sim; 350 &mu;m-thick skin section and normal saline receptor solution, only 2. 1 % of the applied BaP diffused into the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> over five days. In in vitro experiments usingfull-thickness skin and a 6 % solution ofnonionic surfactant <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid,</b> 28. 0 % of the applied BaP diffused into the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> over five days. When both a &sim; 350 &mu;m-thick skin section and a 6 % surfactant receptor solution were used in vitro, 49. 9 % (n = 4, SD = 3. 1 %) of the BaP dose was found in the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> after five days.

40|$|International audienceConcern is {{continuously}} {{raised about}} the safety of parabens which are present in most of the cosmetic preparations. In this investigation, methyl-, ethyl-, propyl- and butyl paraben (MP, EP, PP, BP), in a commercial cosmetic lotion, were deposited on human skin fragments, collected after surgical operations. Permeated parabens were determined after their passage through human epidermis-dermis layers, fixed on Franz diffusion cells. Bovine serum albumin (3 %) was employed as <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid.</b> Then, parabens were assessed by liquid chromatography. The objective of this research was to determine the permeation of these molecules through human epidermis-dermis layers, and their possible passage to body tissues and/or accumulation in skin layers. Two groups of experiments were performed. In the first experimental group (G 1), unique doses of the cosmetic were deposited on skin fragments fixed on Franz cells (n = 6), at time 0 h, followed with different withdrawn times of the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> at 12, 24 and 36 h. G 1 results demonstrated that parabens penetration was influenced by their lipophilicity: more lipophilic the parabens were (BP > PP > EP > MP), less they crossed the skin layers (BP < PP < EP < MP). The second experimental group (G 2) was constituted of three equal deposits on each Franz cell (n = 6) at different hour times 0, 12 and 24 h followed with three withdrawn times of the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> at 12, 24 and 36 h.

In addition, {{the influence of}} biocidal formulations on the absorption of DDAC was investigated. Following dermal exposure to DDAC in aqueous solution, less than 0. 5 % of the applied dose reached the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> after 48 h. The apparent permeability coefficient (Kp) was 5 ± 1 cm/h × 10 - 6 for concentrations 11 mg/mL). However, the amount of DDAC reaching the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> remained low (< 1 % over a 48 h period). Selected biocidal formulations tended to reduce DDAC skin absorption.

Based on the comparison of the distribution of DDAC in full-thickness skin and epidermal membranes, we conclude that approximately one-third of the DDAC measured in the full-thickness membranes resides in the dermis.

Materials and Methods : Fluid movement in jejunum and colon were determined simultaneously in the same rat, by modifying the Beubler method. Nv-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 20 mg/kg, s. c) alone and in combination with L-arginine (L-Arg, 150 mg/kg s. c) or D-arginine (D-Arg, 150 mg/kg, s. c) were administered 30 min before administration of 1 -PBG (18. 5 &# 956;g/kg, i. v). Results : Intravenous administration of 1 -phenylbiguanide (1 -PBG) induced a net secretion of fluid in both jejunum and colon. 1 -PBG had a more prominent secretory effect in the colon, causing a three-fold increase in volume of fluid secreted/g of colon than in the jejunum. Pretreatment with (L-NNA) prevented the 1 -PBG-induced fluid accumulation in both jejunum and colon. The inhibitory effect of L-NNA on 1 -PBG-induced fluid accumulation was reversed by L-Arg but not by D-Arg.

40|$|The {{potential}} EU {{ban on the}} use {{of animals}} in the testing of cosmetic products and their ingredients from 2009 together with the ethical reasons for avoiding tests on human beings have recently prompted the development of guidelines on in vitro alternative methods and an extensive search for novel validated in vitro permeation models. The prediction of the percutaneous absorption by means of in vitro methodologies requires good in vitro-in vivo correlation. Moreover, due to differences in the type of vehicle (conventional vehicles or particulate carriers) and in the physicochemical properties of the substance, such as its solubility, the selection of appropriate in vitro conditions is crucial. In particular, the validation of an in vitro skin penetration model appears quite difficult for highly lipophilic substances, because of their limited rate of transfer between stratum corneum and the viable epidermis, due to their low solubility in most physiological <b>receptor</b> <b>fluids.</b> This chapter focuses on comparative in vitro-in vivo skin permeation of butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, a highly lipophilic UV-A absorber (log Po/w = 5. 6), methylbenzylidene camphor (log Po/w = 4. 8) a less lipophilic sunscreen agent, and glycolic acid, a hydrophilic active substance (log Po/w < 0).

Quantitative estimation of therapeutic drug deposition into all three areas has not previously been reported. Finite doses of minoxidil (2 %, w/v) in formulations containing varying amounts of ethanol, propylene glycol (PG), and water (60 : 20 : 20, 80 : 20 : 0, and 0 : 80 : 20 by volume, respectively) were used. Minoxidil in SC (by tape stripping), appendages (by cyanoacrylate casting), and <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> was determined by liquid scintillation counting. At early times (30 [*]min, 2 [*]h), ethanol-containing formulations (60 : 20 : 20 and 80 : 20 : 0) caused significantly greater minoxidil retention in SC and appendages, compared to the formulation lacking ethanol (0 : 80 : 20).

The skin penetration and distribution of chemicals with differing physicochemical properties, namely; Benzoic acid, 3 -Aminophenol, Caffeine and Sucrose has been assessed in this model. Although, skin penetration over 24 h differed for each chemical, compromising the skin did not alter the shape of the time course profile, although absorption into <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> was higher for each chemical. Systemic exposure (<b>receptor</b> <b>fluid,</b> epidermis and dermis), was marginally higher in compromised skin following exposure to the fast penetrant, Benzoic acid, and the slow penetrant Sucrose. The systemically available dose of 3 -Aminophenol increased to a greater extent and the absorption of Caffeine was more than double in compromised skin, suggesting that Molecular Weight and Log Pow, are not the only determinants for assessing systemic exposure under these conditions.

Nevertheless, the steepest slope was reached within the first hour of exposure (Fig.  1). Similar to caffeine experiments, testosterone permeated slowest across freshly excised dorsal skin. However, the differences between freshly excised and frozen skin {{and the location of}} the skin sites were not as clearly defined as for caffeine absorption [see (Additional file 2) for detailed information on cumulative absorbed doses for each time point].

Two different methods, a two-chamber diffusion cell and a single-chamber glass chamber method, were used to demonstrate the permeation capability.

However, the activity of dermal hydrolases has rarely been investigated in humans, or experimental animals. In the present study, we focused on the identification of rat dermal esterases and the hydrolysis of a prodrug during permeation across rat skin. We found that carboxylesterase (CES), especially the rat CES 1 isozyme, Hydrolase A, is expressed in rat skin and that the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acyl derivatives and caproyl-propranolol (PL) was 20 -fold lower in the 9000 g supernatant fraction of skin homogenate than in liver microsomes. A permeation study of caproyl-PL was performed in rat full-thickness and stripped skin using a flow-through diffusion cell.

Hypothesis/Objectives: To determine effects of various formulation types on penetration and retention of lasalocid applied to canine skin in vitro. Animals: Normal canine skin was collected from the thorax of five dogs that had been euthanized on the basis of health and/or intractable behavioural issues. Methods: Solution, lotion and ointment containing 2 % lasalocid were applied to ex vivo canine skin. Transdermal penetration was assessed for a 24 h period and retention of lasalocid was assessed {{at the conclusion of the}} study.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the human skin penetration of epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) and quercetin from green tea and G. biloba extracts vehiculated in cosmetic formulations. This study was conducted with fresh dermatomed human Caucasian skin from abdominal surgery mounted on static Franz diffusion cells. Skin samples were mounted between two diffusion half-cells and 10 mg/cm(2) of formulations supplemented with 6 % of green tea or G. biloba extract were applied on the skin surface. The <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> was removed after 6 and 24 h and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography for the quantification of the flavonoids. The stratum corneum was removed by tape stripping and immersed in methanol and the epidermis was mechanically separated from the dermis and triturated in methanol to extract EGCG and quercetin. The results showed that the flavonoids under study penetrated into the skin, without reaching the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid.</b> The majority of EGCG was quantified in the stratum corneum (0. 87 mu g/cm(2)), which was statistically higher than the EGCG concentrations found in viable epidermis (0. 54 mu g/cm(2)) and in the dermis (0. 38 mu g/cm(2)). The majority of quercetin was quantified in the viable epidermis (0. 23 mu g/cm(2)), which was statistically higher than the EGCG concentration found in the stratum corneum layer (0. 17 mu g/cm(2)).

40|$|The endocytic pathway of eukaryotes is {{essential}} for the internalization and trafficking of macromolecules, fluid, membranes, and membrane proteins. One of the most enigmatic aspects of this process is endocytic recycling, the return of macromolecules (often <b>receptors)</b> and <b>fluid</b> from endosomes to the plasma membrane. We have previously shown that the EH-domain protein RME- 1 is a critical regulator of endocytic recycling in worms and mammals. Here we identify the RAB- 10 protein as a key regulator of endocytic recycling upstream of RME- 1 in polarized epithelial cells of the Caenorhabditis elegans intestine. rab- 10 null mutant intestinal cells accumulate abnormally abundant RAB- 5 -positive early endosomes, some of which are enlarged by more than 10 -fold. Conversely most RME- 1 -positive recycling endosomes are lost in rab- 10 mutants. The abnormal early endosomes in rab- 10 mutants accumulate basolaterally recycling transmembrane cargo molecules and basolaterally recycling fluid, consistent with a block in basolateral transport. These results indicate a role for RAB- 10 in basolateral recycling upstream of RME- 1.

40|$|Incubation of {{alveolar}} macrophages in hypoosmotic K(+) -containing buffers {{results in}} persistent cell swelling and {{an inability to}} undergo regulatory volume decrease. We demonstrate that cells incubated in hypo- K+ show an inhibition of endocytosis without any observed alteration in recycling. The inhibition of endocytosis affected all forms of membrane internalization, <b>receptor</b> and <b>fluid</b> phase. Both increased cell volume and the inhibition of endocytosis could be released upon return of cells to iso-Na+ buffers. The ability to synchronize the endocytic apparatus allowed us to examine hypotheses regarding the origin and maturation of endocytic vesicles. Incubation in hypo-K+ buffers {{had no effect on}} the delivery of ligands to degradative compartments or on the return of previously internalized receptors to the cell surface. Thus, membrane recycling and movement of internalized components to lysosomes occurred in the absence of continued membrane influx. We also demonstrate that fluorescent lipids, that had been incorporated into early endosomes, returned to the cell surface upon exposure of cells to hypo-K+ buffers. These results indicate that the early sorting endosome is a transient structure, whose existence depends upon continued membrane internalization. Our data supports the hypothesis that the transfer of material to lysosomes can best be explained by the continuous maturation of endosomes...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} P 2 X receptors have {{attracted}} increasing attention as regulators of exocytosis and cellular secretion. In various cell types P 2 X receptors {{have been found}} to stimulate vesicle exocytosis directly via Ca 2 + influx and elevation of the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. Recently, a new role for P 2 X 4 receptors as regulators of secretion emerged. Exocytosis of lamellar bodies (LBs), large storage organelles for lung surfactant, results in a local, fusion-activated Ca 2 + entry (FACE) in alveolar type II epithelial cells. FACE is mediated via P 2 X 4 receptors that are located on the limiting membrane of LBs and inserted into the plasma membrane upon exocytosis of LBs. The localized Ca 2 + influx at the site of vesicle fusion promotes fusion pore expansion and facilitates surfactant release. In addition, this inward-rectifying cation current across P 2 X 4 <b>receptors</b> mediates <b>fluid</b> resorption from lung alveoli. It is hypothesized that the concomitant reduction in the alveolar lining fluid facilitates insertion of surfactant into the air-liquid interphase thereby activating it. These findings constitute a novel role for P 2 X 4 receptors in regulating vesicle content secretion as modulators of the secretory output during the exocytic post-fusion phase...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{chemical}} mixtures {{is more common}} than exposure to a single chemical. Skin is the largest tissue {{in the human body}} and is an important route of exposure {{to chemical}} mixtures. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of toluene, trichloroethylene (TCE) and phenol on the dermal bioavailability of nickel, All four compounds are prevalent in the environment, at industrial facilities, and at hazardous waste sites. An in vitro approach was employed which utilized radiotracer methodology and a modified Teflon flow-through diffusion cell system to measure the amount of chemical which penetrated through or became bound to dermatomed male or female pig skin. In males, there was almost a 2 -fold increase in the total cumulative percentage of radioactivity in the <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> after treatment with the mixture compared to nickel alone. In females, significantly more radioactivity (2 -fold) penetrated into <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> when skin was treated with the chemical mixture of nickel versus nickel alone. The chemical mixture produced a significant increase in the total penetration and the amount of nickel that became bound to skin relative to nickel alone in both sexes. Also, more radioactivity remained loosely adsorbed to skin and could be easily washed off of the skin surface when nickel was applied alone rather than in combination to male or female skin. However, the total penetration and the radioactivity in the skin matrix was significantly higher in females than in males treated with the nickel mixture. This study revealed that the bioavailability of nickel to skin is significantly higher when administered in the chemical mixture compared to nickel alone. Furthermore, females are at greater risk than males from dermal exposure to the nickel mixture...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of Chamomile oil as absorption enhancers for cutaneously administered Silver Sulfadiazine by comparing it with a penetration enhancer Dimethyl Sulfoxide. Silver sulfadiazine is used in burn infection. Gel was selected as the vehicle for Silver Rat’ skin samples were placed in a continuous flow diffusion cell, with Silver Sulfadiazine gel on top. <b>Receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. The quantity of gel remaining on the skin surface after completion of each test was weighed and the amount of drug in the skin was analyzed. Addition of chamomile oil or Dimethyl Sulfoxide to the gel increased the percutaneous absorption of the drug. 5 % Chamomile oil was found to be the most efficient absorption enhancer in this comparison...|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} of a pyrethroid insecticide, cypermethrin, through rat skin has been measured both in vitro and in vivo. Cypermethrin did not penetrate in vitro through whole skin but did penetrate epidermal membranes. The in vitro absorption {{was influenced by}} the choice of <b>receptor</b> <b>fluid</b> in the glass diffusion cell. There was good agreement between in vivo and in vitro data using 50 % aqueous ethanol, 6 % Volpo 20, or total calf serum receptor fluids. Rat epidermal membranes in vitro were more than 20 times more permeable to cypermethrin than human epidermal membranes, indicating that cypermethrin would be less readily absorbed in humans than in the rat. The percutaneous absorption in vitro technique using epidermal membranes was successfully used with this Iipophilic chemical to predict the in vivo absorption in the rat...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} guanylyl cyclase {{cell receptors}} are known, but others {{will likely be}} discovered {{within the next few}} years. The general function of these receptors appear to relate to the regulation of fluid volume or <b>fluid</b> movement. New <b>receptors,</b> or possibly the currently known receptors, therefore, may be discovered in areas of the body where fluid volume regulation is important. Such fluids whose volume or composition might be regulated by guanylyl cyclase <b>receptors</b> include synovial <b>fluid,</b> uterine/oviductal luminal fluid, follicular fluid, aqueous humor, cerebral spinal fluid, seminiferous tubule luminal fluid, epididymal luminal fluid, seminal plasma, and airway luminal fluid. The function of the heterodimeric forms of guanylyl cyclase appear to relate to a primary regulation of nitric oxide (or similar molecules) concentrations, which are in turn regulated by a Ca 2 +/calmodulin-sensitive nitric oxide synthase...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{development}} of a reliable in vitro permeation system necessitates {{the use of a}} precise and accurate method of quantifying the amount of permeant partitioning from the membrane into the cell receptor phase. Aqueous donor and <b>receptor</b> chamber <b>fluids</b> have been used in the majority of reported investigations, which makes quantitative permeant analysis relatively facile. Alternatively, radiolabelled diffusants have been used and flux rates monitored by scintillation counting, obviating the need for chromatographic separation of the receptor-phase components. However, this technique is not applicable when nonlabelled compounds or commercial dosage forms are to be evaluated by a cell system. Furthermore, several studies indicate that aqueous receptor phases may not present an optimal partitioning environment for certain lipophilic permeants (1 - 4), thereby impairing accurate flux monitoring due to limited diffusant solubility. Several attempts have therefore been made to improve the partitioning environment within these systems, by the addition of surfactants for example (4). A lipophilic receptor environment appears beneficial for corticosteroid partitioning, and thus, the use of isopropyl myristate has been investigated because of its bipolar properties that tend to mimic the biochemical composition of the skin (5, 6). Betamethasone 17 -valerate and its 21 -valerate degradation product are highly soluble in isopropyl myristate and this nonaqueous solvent will not augment C- 17 -to-C- 21 ester degradation reactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{theory of}} dentin sensitivity states that a stimulus applied at the orifice of exposed dentinal tubules causes movement of tubular fluid which stimulates nerve <b>receptors.</b> The <b>fluid</b> should obey principles of fluid move-ment through capillary tubes. Any {{decrease in the}} functional radius of the dentinal tubules should greatly reduce the rate of fluid flow, thus reducing dentinal sensitivity. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the ability of agents that have been used previously for clinical dentin desensitization to reduce the rate offluid flow through dentin in vitro. Dentin discs prepared from extracted human third molars were treated with 50 % citric acid to remove debris from tubular orifices. After placing the discs in a split chamber device, the rate at which buffer solution could filter across the dentin under 240 cm of water pressure was measured. The occlusal side of the disc was then treated with an agent thought to desensitize dentin to deter-mine if it reduced fluid flow rate. Discs that had more than a 50 % reduction in flow rate were examined by scanning electron microscopy to determine if those agents that decreased fluid flow also partially occluded tubular orifices. This in vitro model provided a useful quantitative method for screening a host of preparations that have been used in the past to decrease dentin sensitivity...|$|R
