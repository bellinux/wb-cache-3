40|$|Although the John Brewer <b>Reef</b> <b>Floating</b> Hotel {{remained}} in operation {{for only one}} year from March 1988, its construction and installation triggered a major environmental assessment and monitoring program which was innovative in many ways. First, the hotel {{was the first of}} its kind in the world so the potential impacts were largely unknown and, second, there was increasing community pressure for comprehensive assessments of environmental impacts given the high conservation value placed on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park - a World Heritage Area. As a result, the environmental impact assessment and monitoring procedure which was implemented was probably the most complex that had been attempted for a project of that scale in Australia and proved, in many ways, to be a pilot for studies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park since then. The program involved many individuals and several institutions working in areas such as oceanography, water quality, biological monitoring and social impact studies, with the program coordinated by the Centre for Coastal Management at the University of New England - Northern Rivers (then known as the Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education) on behalf of the proponent...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{of various}} coastal {{phenomena}} on the Kujukuri Coast and Kashimanada Coast {{was done by}} the use of aircraft for the purpose of investigating the characteristics of shore <b>reefs</b> and <b>floating</b> sand, and the depth of the sea. A multispectral camera and a video ITV camera were used as sensors. The first flight was over the Kashimanada and Kujukuri Coasts and the next flight was over the Katsuura Bay. The shape of shore reefs, the state of floating sand, the depth of the sea, etc., are represented by equidensitographs using texture. The interval of density slices is 0. 05. Correlations between the textures represented by equidensitographs, digital graphs and analog display are estimated...|$|R
50|$|The United States Army Corps of Engineers dredged {{the harbor}} and built the breakwall between 1957 and 1959 and brought the village back from obscurity. In 1970, {{construction}} of a small boat harbor began {{to the south of}} the main harbor entrance by several institutions under the name of Project Tugboat. It was designed as a test of the use of high explosives to create harbors in hard substrate and as a proof of the concept that small nuclear charges could be used for civil works projects. Over 100 tons of conventional explosives (roughly equivalent to the smallest nuclear charge that could be built at that time) were buried in the Kawaihae reef and detonated to clear the basin and the entrance. It is the home of Kawaihae Canoe Club. It also served as the launching point for the film Waterworld with Kevin Costner. The artificial <b>reef</b> or <b>floating</b> island was just off the coast with headquarters for the movie at the harbor.|$|R
60|$|Some of the time, moreover, Betts {{passed in}} fishing, {{supplying}} not only Mark and himself, but the pigs and the poultry, {{with as much}} food as was desired. Several of the fish caught {{turned out to be}} delicious, while others were of a quality that caused them to be thrown into the compost heap. A cargo of guano was also imported, the rich manure being mixed up in liberal quantities with the loam. At {{the end of the first}} week of these voyages to 'loam-rock,' Betts went out to fish in a new direction, passing to windward of the 'sea-wall,' as they called the reef that protected the ship, and pulling towards a bit of naked rock a short distance beyond it, where he fancied he might find a particular sort of little fish, that greatly resembled the Norfolk Hog-fish, one of the most delicious little creatures for the pan that is to be found in all the finny tribe. He had been gone a couple of hours, when Mark, who was at work within the crater, picking up the encrusted ashes that formed its surface, heard Bob's shout outside, as if he wished assistance. Throwing down the pick, our young man ran out, and was not a little surprised to see the sort of cargo with which Bob was returning to port. It would seem that a great collection of sea-weed had formed to windward of the rock where Bob had gone to fish, at which spot it ordinarily gathered in a pile until the heap became too large to lodge any longer, when, owing to the form of the rock, it invariably broke adrift, and passed to the southward of the <b>Reef,</b> <b>floating</b> to leeward, to fetch up on some other rock, or island, in that direction. Bob had managed to get this raft round a particular point in the reef, when the wind and current carried it, as near as might be, directly towards the crater. He was calling to Mark to come to his assistance, to help get the raft into a sort of bay, ahead of him, where it might be lodged; else would there be the danger of its drifting past the Reef, after all his pains. Our young man saw, at once, what was wanted, got a line, succeeded in throwing it to Bob, and by hauling upon it brought the whole mass ashore in the very spot Betts wished to see it landed.|$|R
50|$|Under British colonial rule, the {{government}} controlled gold mining {{to protect the}} profits of European companies. The colonial government also restricted possession of gold {{as well as of}} mercury, essential in recovering gold from the ore in which it is embedded. Following independence, foreign control of the sector was tempered by increasing government involvement under the Nkrumah regime; however, production began to decline in the late 1960s and did not recover for almost twenty years. In the mid-1960s, many mines began to hit poorer gold <b>reefs.</b> Despite the <b>floating</b> of the international gold price in the late 1960s, few investors were willing to invest, and {{the government}} failed to provide the capital necessary to expand production into new reefs. Of the two major gold mining enterprises, neither the State Gold Mining Corporation nor AGC (40% controlled by the government) expanded or even maintained production.|$|R
2500|$|Cage {{design is}} {{important}} in preventing escape of juveniles and entry of predators and also shading of algal and seaweed on rocks. Recommended designs include cages with 8x8mm plastic mesh and an aluminium frame. Steel reef, plastic <b>reef</b> and plastic <b>floating</b> cages have proven ineffective as steel reef cages allowed high mortality from predator entry and plastic cages induced shading of the rocks algae and seaweed are attached to which results in low productivity. Suitable locations for reef cages are sand and rubble bottom reef bases exposed to less wave action [...] or fore-flat zones which are 10m behind the reef crest with water depths of 0 to 2.5m during spring-tides. Shifting sand and sediment deposition areas may smother foraging surfaces {{and need to be}} avoided when allocating cages;. Wind-ward sections of the reef flat are considered suitable sites. Floating cages require frequent cleaning to remove fouling species and allow high water flow and/ or nutrient flux for high algal biomass and quality. [...] Other environmental factors such as water temperature and salinity can have seasonal and episodic effects on the growth of the juveniles.|$|R
40|$|The marine topshell Trochus niloticus (‘trochus’) {{has been}} overfished {{throughout}} its distribution. Intermediate culture in reef-based cages {{may be an}} effective approach for providing sub-adults for restocking. In Vanuatu, 15 – 30 mm (basal shell width; BSW) tagged juveniles were grown over a 9 -month period at varied stocking densities inside steel reef, plastic <b>reef</b> and plastic <b>floating</b> cages; n= 12 for each caging type. Shell sizes, mortality and escapement were recorded at 3 -month intervals. Repeated measures ANCOVA showed that shell growth was inversely dependent on stocking density and differed significantly among caging types. Growth rates decreased significantly through time in all treatments. Reef-based cages were more problematic than floating cages, but yielded faster shell growth of trochus, averaging 2. 6 mm month− 1. Stocking densities up to 30 juveniles m− 2 are recommended. In all caging types, mortality was relatively low (8 – 21 %) but escapement was high, indicating that cages should be purpose-built for trochus culture. The findings show that high numbers of small juvenile trochus can be cultured in cages to 40 – 50 mm BSW in 9 months then released onto reefs with expected high survival to broodstock size. Intermediate culture in sea cages thus provides an effective, intermediate step for restocking...|$|R
40|$|Estuarine environments are {{threatened}} by the synergistic effects of anthropogenic disturbance and bioinvasion. The construction of artificial structures (such as pilings and pontoons) provides a habitat resource {{in close proximity to}} vessel hulls that may be carrying a wide range of non-indigenous fouling species. In addition, the release and accumulation of toxicants from antifouling (AF) paints on vessel hulls creates a chemical disturbance that may reduce the invasion resistance of native communities. This thesis examines how shipping-related disturbances affect sessile communities, and in particular what role AF paints and artificial structures play in the invasion of estuaries. Using a series of field-based experiments, I found that copper and tributyltin have the potential to influence both the transport of species to a new region, via the application of AF paints on vessel hulls, and their subsequent establishment, via the accumulation of AF biocides in estuaries. Temperature, pH, salinity and turbidity were also related to species distributions. During subtidal surveys of artificial and natural structures I found more non-indigenous species (NIS) on pilings and pontoons than on rocky <b>reef,</b> and shallow <b>floating</b> structures were identified as hotspots for invaders. These findings suggest that artificial structures {{play an important role in}} the initial establishment of sessile non-indigenous species in new regions. A subset of NIS were also present on the reefs sampled during the survey and I conducted manipulative experiments to determine factors affecting the invasibility of turf and canopy-forming algal assemblages. The resident assemblage provided a barrier to most invaders, particularly when light and sedimentation levels were also high (i. e. on horizontal substrate). My results suggest that the areas of reef most susceptible to invasion are vertical rock walls and those subjected to disturbances that release space. In summary, this is the first study to relate copper and tributyltin contamination in the field to NIS distributions. My research has also highlighted the potential role of artificial structures in facilitating the establishment of NIS in estuaries and identified invasion threats to rock wall communities and disturbed reefs in estuarine systems...|$|R
5000|$|The {{growth of}} the cultured {{individuals}} can depend on the density of juveniles in the cages and the likely causes are competition for food and space. An initial density of 100 trochus m-2 achieves a basal diameter of 10-20mm which can then be reduced to 50 trochus m-2 to yield basal diameters 25-40mm. Beyond this range a density of less than 10 trochus m-2 is recommended. Seaweed and algae are the main food and these grow on the dead corals and rocks which may occur naturally at the cultured sites or collected from adjacent areas and placed {{at the bottom of}} the cages. It is recommended that for cages with juveniles sized >30mm, these seaweed-covered rocks should be replaced 2 to 3 times a month and cover over 50% of the area. Cage design is important in preventing escape of juveniles and entry of predators and also shading of algal and seaweed on rocks. Recommended designs include cages with 8x8mm plastic mesh and an aluminium frame. Steel reef, plastic <b>reef</b> and plastic <b>floating</b> cages have proven ineffective as steel reef cages allowed high mortality from predator entry and plastic cages induced shading of the rocks algae and seaweed are attached to which results in low productivity.
