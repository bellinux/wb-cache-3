5|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle in soils {{depends on the}} fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. This is achieved {{by a number of}} diazotrophs. One way this can occur is in the nodules in the roots of legumes that contain symbiotic bacteria of the genera <b>Rhizobium,</b> Mesorhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Azorhizobium.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter {{species are}} free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria; in {{contrast}} to <b>Rhizobium</b> species, they normally fix molecular nitrogen from the atmosphere without symbiotic relations with plants, although some Azotobacter species are associated with plants. Nitrogen fixation is inhibited {{in the presence of}} available nitrogen sources, such as ammonium ions and nitrates.|$|E
5|$|Modified bases {{also occur}} in DNA. The {{first of these}} {{recognised}} was 5-methylcytosine which {{was found in the}} genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1925. The complete replacement of cytosine by 5-glycosylhydroxymethylcytosine in T even phages (T2, T4 and T6) was observed in 1953 In the genomes of Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp12 and halovirus FH the full complement of cystosine has been replaced by 5-methylcytosine. 6N-methyadenine was discovered to be present in DNA in 1955. N6-carbamoyl-methyladenine was described in 1975. 7-methylguanine was described in 1976. N4-methylcytosine in DNA was described in 1983. In 1985 5-hydroxycytosine was found in the genomes of the <b>Rhizobium</b> phages RL38JI and N17. α-putrescinylthymine occurs in both the genomes of the Delftia phage ΦW-14 and the Bacillus phage SP10. α-glutamythymidine is found in the Bacillus phage SP01 and 5-dihydroxypentyluracil is found in the Bacillus phage SP15.|$|E

25|$|Biofilms {{are formed}} by {{bacteria}} that colonize plants, e.g. Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and related pseudomonads which are common plant-associated bacteria found on leaves, roots, {{and in the}} soil, {{and the majority of}} their natural isolates form biofilms. Several nitrogen-fixing symbionts of legumes such as <b>Rhizobium</b> leguminosarum and Sinorhizobium meliloti form biofilms on legume roots and other inert surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Bacteria {{that produce}} {{cellulose}} include Gram-negative bacteria {{species such as}} Acetobacter, Azotobacter, <b>Rhizobium,</b> Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Alcaligenes, and Gram-positive bacteria species such as Sarcina ventriculi. The most effective producers of cellulose are A. xylinum, A. hansenii, and A. pasteurianus. Of these, A. xylinum is the model microorganism for basic and applied studies on cellulose due to its ability to produce relatively high levels of polymer {{from a wide range}} of carbon and nitrogen sources.|$|E
25|$|Extracellular endosymbionts {{are also}} {{represented}} {{in all four}} extant classes of Echinodermata (Crinoidea, Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea, and Holothuroidea). Little is known {{of the nature of}} the association (mode of infection, transmission, metabolic requirements, etc.) but phylogenetic analysis indicates that these symbionts belong to the alpha group of the class Proteobacteria, relating them to <b>Rhizobium</b> and Thiobacillus. Other studies indicate that these subcuticular bacteria may be both abundant within their hosts and widely distributed among the Echinoderms in general.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens (updated {{scientific}} name <b>Rhizobium</b> radiobacter, synonym Agrobacterium radiobacter) is the causal agent of {{crown gall disease}} (the formation of tumours) in over 140 species of eudicots. It is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative soil bacterium. Symptoms are caused by the insertion of a small segment of DNA (known as the T-DNA, for 'transfer DNA', {{not to be confused}} with tRNA that transfers amino acids during protein synthesis, confusingly also called transfer RNA), from a plasmid, into the plant cell, which is incorporated at a semi-random location into the plant genome.|$|E
25|$|Biofilms can {{be found}} on rocks and pebbles at the bottom of most streams or rivers and often form on the surface of {{stagnant}} pools of water. Biofilms are important components of food chains in rivers and streams and are grazed by the aquatic invertebrates upon which many fish feed. Biofilms are found on the surface of and inside plants. They can either contribute to crop disease or, {{as in the case of}} nitrogen-fixing <b>Rhizobium</b> on roots, exist symbiotically with the plant. Examples of crop diseases related to biofilms include Citrus Canker, Pierce's Disease of grapes, and Bacterial Spot of plants such as peppers and tomatoes.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that AM fungi release an unidentified diffusional factor, known as the myc factor, which activates the nodulation factor's inducible gene MtEnod11. This is the same gene involved in establishing symbiosis with the nitrogen fixing, rhizobial bacteria (Kosuta et al. 2003). When <b>rhizobium</b> bacteria are present in the soil, mycorrhizal colonization is increased due to an increase in the concentration of chemical signals involved in the establishment of symbiosis (Xie et al. 2003). Molecules similar to Nod factors were isolated from AM fungi and were shown to induce MtEnod11, lateral root formation and enhance mycorrhization. Effective mycorrhizal colonization can also increase the nodulations and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in mycorrhizal legumes.|$|E
500|$|Root nodules {{containing}} <b>Rhizobium</b> bacteria {{have been}} found on R. regia trees in India. [...] The presence of rhizobia-containing root nodules is usually associated with nitrogen fixation in legumes; {{this was the first}} record of root nodules in a monocotyledonous tree. [...] Further evidence of nitrogen fixation was provided by the presence of nitrogenase (an enzyme used in nitrogen fixation) and leghaemoglobin, a compound which allows nitrogenase to function by reducing the oxygen concentration in the root nodule. [...] In addition to evidence of nitrogen fixation, the nodules were also found to be producing indole acetic acid, an important plant hormone.|$|E

They can grow {{in a wide}} range of soils, with optimum growth in moist alluvial soils with a good organic content. Soybeans, like most legumes, perform nitrogen fixation by establishing a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum (syn. <b>Rhizobium</b> japonicum; Jordan 1982). For best results, though, an inoculum of the correct strain of bacteria should be mixed with the soybean (or any legume) seed before planting. Modern crop cultivars generally reach a height of around , and take 80–120days from sowing to harvesting.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fixation}} {{of atmospheric}} nitrogen {{is a very}} energy-intensive process, as it involves breaking the very stable triple bond between the nitrogen atoms. The enzyme nitrogenase {{is one of the}} few enzymes that can catalyze the process. The enzyme occurs in <b>Rhizobium</b> bacteria. There are three components to its action: a molybdenum atom at the active site, iron–sulfur clusters that are involved in transporting the electrons needed to reduce the nitrogen, and an abundant energy source in the form of magnesium ATP. This last is provided by a symbiotic relationship between the bacteria and a host plant, often a legume. The relationship is symbiotic because the plant supplies the energy by photosynthesis and benefits by obtaining the fixed nitrogen. The reaction may be written symbolically as ...|$|E
2500|$|Atmospheric {{nitrogen}} must be processed, or [...] "fixed", in a usable form to {{be taken}} up by plants. Between 5x1012 and 10x1012 g per year are fixed by lightning strikes, but most fixation is done by free-living or symbiotic bacteria known as diazotrophs. These bacteria have the nitrogenase enzyme that combines gaseous nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia, which is converted by the bacteria into other organic compounds. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo-nitrogenase, found {{in a wide variety}} of bacteria and some Archaea. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two-component enzyme that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups. An example of the free-living bacteria is Azotobacter. [...] Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as <b>Rhizobium</b> usually live in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a mutualistic relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for carbohydrates. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such symbioses. Today, about 30% of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the Haber-Bosch process, which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source (natural gas or petroleum) into ammonia.|$|E
2500|$|Biochemically, prokaryotic {{heterotrophic}} metabolism is {{much more}} versatile than that of eukaryotic organisms, although many prokaryotes share the most basic metabolic models with eukaryotes, e. g. using glycolysis (also called EMP pathway) for sugar metabolism and the citric acid cycle to degrade acetate, producing {{energy in the form}} of ATP and reducing power in the form of NADH or quinols. [...] These basic pathways are well conserved because they are also involved in biosynthesis of many conserved building blocks needed for cell growth (sometimes in reverse direction). [...] However, many bacteria and archaea utilize alternative metabolic pathways other than glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. [...] A well-studied example is sugar metabolism via the keto-deoxy-phosphogluconate pathway (also called ED pathway) in Pseudomonas. [...] Moreover, there is a third alternative sugar-catabolic pathway used by some bacteria, the pentose phosphate pathway. The metabolic diversity and ability of prokaryotes to use a large variety of organic compounds arises from the much deeper evolutionary history and diversity of prokaryotes, as compared to eukaryotes. [...] It is also noteworthy that the mitochondrion, the small membrane-bound intracellular organelle that is the site of eukaryotic energy metabolism, arose from the endosymbiosis of a bacterium related to obligate intracellular Rickettsia, and also to plant-associated <b>Rhizobium</b> or Agrobacterium. [...] Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} all mitrochondriate eukaryotes share metabolic properties with these Proteobacteria. [...] Most microbes respire (use an electron transport chain), although oxygen is not the only terminal electron acceptor that may be used. [...] As discussed below, the use of terminal electron acceptors other than oxygen has important biogeochemical consequences.|$|E
