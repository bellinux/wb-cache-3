40|$|A {{dimensionless}} {{measure of}} otolith mass asymmetry, w, was calculated as {{the difference between}} the masses of the right and left paired otoliths divided by average otolith mass. Saccular otolith mass asymmetry was studied in eight flatfish species (110 otolith pairs) and compared with data from a previously published study on <b>roundfishes.</b> As in the case of symmetrical fishes, the absolute value of w in flatfishes does not depend on fish length and otolith growth rate, although otolith mass and the absolute value of otolith mass difference are correlated with fish length. The values of w were between 02 and þ 02 in 964 % of flatfishes studied. The mean S. E. value of w in flatfishes was significantly larger than in standard bilaterally symmetrical marine fishes (‘roundfishes’), respectively 0070 0006 and 0040 0006. The most prominent distinction is the existence of downside prevalence of saccular otolith mass in flatfishes, which contrasts with no right–left prevalence in <b>roundfishes</b> found in a previous study. In the right-eyed flatfishes (Soleidae), the left saccular otoliths are heavier than the right otoliths. In the left-eyed flatfishes (Bothidae and Citharidae), the right saccular otoliths are heavier than the left otoliths.

Among 45 tested species, all showed a significant correlation between total length (L) and total weight (W). The influence of sex on WLR was estimated for 39 species and presented a significant sexual dimorphism for 18 species. Condition factor (K) of females was always higher than for males. Moreover, a spatial effect on the WLR according to five ecoregions (the Bay of Biscay, the Celtic Sea, the Western English Channel, the Eastern English Channel and the North Sea), was significant for 18 species among 38 tested species. The temporal effect was tested according to components (year and quarter/season). The seasonality effect on WLR is more frequently significant than the year especially for the Elasmobranchii species, and {{can be related to}} the spawning season.

40|$|Discards {{generated}} from marine fisheries have significantly affected species populations and community composition of seabirds through mechanisms such as competition, predator–prey interactions and nutrient transfer. Our {{understanding of the}} fate of discards beyond seabird scavenging is fragmented, but {{it is likely that}} similar mechanisms come into play. This study contributes in resolving this knowledge gap by quantifying the amount and composition of discards that become available to scavengers other than seabirds. The key was nevertheless found in revealing seabird discard consumption, as seabirds are likely the first in taking profit of fishery discards due to their high mobility. Their selective consumption determines the composition and amount of food remaining for others. The consumption of discards by scavenging seabirds was assessed for the French fishing fleet in the Bay of Biscay. Experimental sea trials were conducted to assess the proportion of discards consumed by foraging guild and discard type. Experimental discard consumption (EDC) was raised to fleet level by foraging guild using the total number of discards by discard type. The raising procedure accounted for the spatio-temporal variability of both foraging guilds and discards, by standardising both distributions to their lowest common resolution. Discards limited inferences in space, whilst the highest temporal resolution was determined by the biennial monitoring of foraging guilds. As EDC of <b>roundfish</b> by Large gulls and Gannets varied considerably, we investigated the main drivers. Consumption increased logarithmically with the number of ship followers for both guilds, but was greatly impaired by competitors for Large gulls. Competition between Large gulls and Gannets reduced the <b>roundfish</b> consumption by threefold, while other guilds such as Kittiwakes, Procellariids and Skuas had only a limited though significant influence. As Large gulls dominated during the first semester (April to September), the consumption of discards and notably <b>roundfish</b> was dictated by this foraging guild. The abundance of ship following Gannets was remarkably higher in the second semester (October to March). This change in flock composition and in numbers of ship followers implied an increase in the consumed proportion of <b>roundfish</b> of 27. 9 %. The total number of discards that became available to non-avian scavengers was however higher in the first semester, as more discards were produced during this period. Most discards comprised benthic invertebrates, but excluding this discard type revealed that over two thirds of the discards remained <b>roundfish...</b>|$|E

40|$|Metamorphosis is the {{developmental}} {{process by which}} larvae become adult-like juveniles. In both amphibia and flatfish thyroid hormones (THs) {{have been shown to}} drive metamorphosis and probably also influence the larval to juvenile transition in <b>roundfish.</b> Remarkably {{little is known about the}} regulation and expression of deiodinase genes that are responsible for TH metabolism or the TH-responsive genes at this developmental stage in teleosts. The objective of this thesis was to characterise the potential role of deiodinases in the metamorphosis of the Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), a flatfish and the analogous larval to juvenile transition in a <b>roundfish</b> the gilthead sea bream (Spams auratus). Fast and slow muscle Troponin-T genes were cloned from both species and found to be differentially regulated by THs. Species specific differences were found in TnT genes and their expression profiles during development which probably reflect the significant differences in muscle ontogeny between these teleosts. A halibut epidermal-keratin gene was also isolated and shown to be differentially expressed in skin during metamorphosis and related to molecular, cellular and histological changes that occur at this time. Genes encoding all three deiodinase enzymes (which regulate intracellular TH levels in target tissues) were isolated from both halibut and sea bream and their expression profile was correlated to molecular and cellular changes in muscle during the larval to juvenile transition in both teleosts. The results presented here strongly suggest that despite the significant morphological differences that exist between halibut metamorphosis and sea bream larval to juvenile transition the overall relationships between deiodinases expression is conserved suggesting that THs have a similar role in both these processes...|$|E

The objective is to examine whether modifying the species selectivity properties can contribute to rebuild overexploited stocks. To meet this objective, conceptual and empirical bioeconomic models were constructed. The conceptual model was used to investigate the qualitative impacts and the empirical model was used to derive the quantitative impacts of modifying the species selectivity properties of the gear. ^ In the conceptual part of this study, a stylized model was developed to analyze the longrun equilibrium bioeconomic properties of modifying the species selectivity properties of the gears. The study examined two polar cases, namely when the gears were perfectly non-selective and perfectly selective. ^ The analysis showed {{that there was a}} considerable amount of uncertainty regarding the impact of technological improvement. Policy prescriptions for rebuilding stocks varied dramatically {{depending on the type of}} technology employed and the presence of biological interrelationships. In the perfectly non-selective gear case, rebuilding strategies would benefit from decreasing the catchability of the overexploited species as long as the stocks were biologically independent. In the presence of biological interrelationships, decreasing the catchability yielded ambiguous results. Other policies, such as increasing the catchability of accompanying species, and simultaneously decreasing the catchability of the target species and increasing the catchability of the accompanying species also generated ambiguous results. ^ In the empirical part of the study, a bioeconomic model of the Georges Bank multispecies fishery was constructed. The model had four species groups (<b>roundfish,</b> flatfish, elasmobranchs, and pelagics) and three gears types (otter trawl, gillnet and longline). The model evaluated the long-term biological and economic implications of changing the gear design or configuration (technology-based changes) and the creation of a tax-subsidy program (market-based changes). ^ Model results suggested that technological and market-based programs could aid in the rebuilding process; however, by themselves they are insufficient to recover the stocks.

The experimental trawl produced catches similar to the control trawl for all commercially valuable flatfish, except arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, which was reduced 24 %. Catches of most rockfish and <b>roundfish</b> were significantly reduced in the experimental trawl (50 – 94 % depending on species). However, the catches of darkblotched rockfish Sebastes crameri and redbanded rockfish S. babcocki were not reduced significantly in the experimental trawl. Nighttime catches were reduced 30 – 99 % for most rockfish species, the greatest reductions occurring in the experimental trawl. The large nighttime catch reduction for several rockfish species for both trawls along with no catch reduction in Dover sole Microstomus pacificus, suggests that fishing only at night may be a viable bycatch-reduction strategy for some rockfish species. The diel and depth-related variation in catch rates we noted for the selective flatfish trawl indicates that catches by this trawl may be especially sensitive to physical and environmental factors such as time of day, depth, or turbidity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Detailed {{observations}} of the behaviour of harbour seals, Phoca vitulina L., at sites within the estuaries of the Rivers Dee and Don, in north-eastern Scotland, were made over two full years between 1993 and 1996. Small numbers of grey seals, Halichoerus grypus Fab., were also present. The presence of seals within the estuaries was strongly related to season, with maximum numbers observed in winter and early spring; seals were virtually absent in June and July. The River Don was used largely as a haul-out site, while the River Dee was used predominantly as a foraging site, {{although it was not}} possible to determine whether the same seals were using the two estuaries. More seals were hauled-out on the River Don during twilight and dark than in daylight. The seals were observed to eat mostly salmonids, Salmo salar L. and S. trutta L., unidentified <b>roundfish</b> and flounder, Pleuronectes flesus L. The otoliths identified in scats collected at the mouth of the River Don belonged to marine species indicating that the seals were also feeding outside the estuaries. A minimum estimate is given of the numbers of large salmonids eaten in each river during the course of the year. Although no information was available on the numbers of salmonids using the rivers or the reproductive status of the fish eaten by the seals, as a cause of mortality, seal predation on large salmonids in estuaries is apparently an order of magnitude less important than mortality caused by angling within the river...|$|E
