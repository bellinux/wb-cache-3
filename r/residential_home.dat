5|$|Beginning {{with only}} two {{teachers}} and 26 students in a single classroom in Towner Road, the new association rapidly expanded over the 1960s, building special schools at Margaret Drive and Jurong, a sheltered workshop at Geylang, a <b>residential</b> <b>home</b> at Tampines {{as well as their}} main administration centre, Lee Kong Chian Centre. SARC started a subcommittee for services for those with less severe intellectual disabilities in 1971 and a youth volunteering group the year after; the subcommittee was split into an independent organisation, the Association for the Educationally Subnormal (AESN), in 1976. In 1983 SARC launched the first early intervention programme in Singapore, prompting other organisations to follow suit and set up an adjunct subcommittee that became Special Olympics Singapore.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{characteristics}} of elderly people living in <b>residential</b> and nursing <b>homes</b> over the period 1981 - 1996. The paper draws on information collected in four surveys: a 1981 survey of local authority, private and voluntary residential homes; a 1986 survey of private and voluntary residential and nursing homes; a 1988 survey of local authority residential homes; and a 1996 survey of local authority, private and voluntary <b>residential</b> <b>homes,</b> and private and voluntary nursing homes. The distributions of length of stay for permanent residents in local authority and voluntary <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> and nursing homes in 1996 {{were similar to those}} in 1986 / 88. Mean lengths of stay for voluntary <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> and nursing homes were slightly shorter in 1996 than in 1986, whereas the reverse appears to be the case for local authority homes. However, the mean length of stay of permanent residents in private <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> was substantially longer in 1996 than in 1986. In terms of their length of stay, permanent residents in private <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> resembled those in local authority homes in 1996. In 1996, residents in nursing homes were most likely to have been admitted from hospital and residents in <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> were most likely to have been living alone prior to admission, particularly in voluntary <b>residential</b> <b>homes.</b> Residents in private <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> {{were more likely to have}} been admitted from hospital than residents in local authority and voluntary <b>residential</b> <b>homes.</b> A larger proportion of residents in voluntary <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> and nursing homes had been admitted from hospital in 1996 than in 1986, whereas the proportion had decreased for private <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> and, to a greater extent, for local authority homes. In 1996, residents in nursing homes were substantially more dependent than residents in <b>residential</b> <b>homes,</b> whereas levels of dependency among residents of local authority, private and voluntary <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> were quite similar. Prior to 1996, residents in voluntary <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> were less dependent than residents in local authority and private <b>residential</b> <b>homes.</b> Levels of dependency increased in all types of home between 1986 / 88 and 1996, but the changes were greater for voluntary <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> and nursing homes, although levels of dependency among residents of nursing homes were also greater than in local authority and private <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> in 1986 / 88. In 1981, residents in local authority and private <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> had similar levels of physical functioning and were much more dependent than residents in voluntary <b>residential</b> <b>homes.</b> Between 1981 and 1986 / 88 levels of dependency among residents of local authority and voluntary <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> increased, but levels of dependency among residents of private <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> were very similar in 1981 and 1986...|$|R

40|$|Dependency {{levels were}} {{compared}} in residents of private, voluntary and statutory <b>residential</b> <b>homes,</b> private {{nursing homes and}} patients in geriatric continuing-care wards in South Belfast. Dependency levels were least in private and voluntary <b>residential</b> <b>homes,</b> were similar in residential and private nursing homes, but were very much greater in the geriatric wards. Evidence of dementia was found in 23 °O of residents of voluntary homes, 35 °O of residents of private <b>residential</b> <b>homes,</b> 61 °o of residents of statutory <b>residential</b> <b>homes,</b> 54 °O of those in private nursing homes and 80 °o of patients in geriatric wards. Severe degrees of immobility and incontinence were commoner in nursing than in <b>residential</b> <b>homes,</b> but much commoner in geriatric wards. The number of private <b>residential</b> and nursing <b>home</b> places in the area studied has increased three- to five-fold since a previous survey in 1985. In this time, dependency levels, and frequencies of dementia, immobility and incontinence have increased in both statutory <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> and geriatric continuing-care wards. It appears, therefore, that private <b>residential</b> and nursing <b>homes</b> take rather less dependent old people and that highly dependent old people are being concentrated in hospital.

40|$|Children and {{adolescents}} with behavioral disorders are {{often referred to}} <b>residential</b> <b>homes.</b> These homes cater and treat socially disadvantaged adolescents {{with a history of}} deviant behavior. This study investigated the environment of eight adolescents in these <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> and four non-aggressive adolescents living with their families. The daily activities were recorded by using camera-glasses attached to the subject. These activities took place in school, leisure time, family and <b>residential</b> <b>homes.</b> Other additional methods were used to investigate the perception and experience of these adolescents. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the adolescents in <b>residential</b> <b>homes</b> have a smaller living space in contrast to the non-aggressive adolescents. They also have less close relationships and fewer interactions with their peers. Moreover they have more conflicts and show more often aggressive behavior and they are more often victims of aggression...|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} congregation {{was started}} in 1941 as a local minyan, led by several prominent Syrian Jewish families in a <b>residential</b> <b>home</b> located at 1756 Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, New York. Early in its development, the synagogue generally maintained around 75 worshippers. However, during the High Holidays, attendance swelled to 750 congregants at a nearby hall called Aperion Manor, {{a few blocks away}} at 815 Kings Highway due to space constraints at the home. The high attendance indicated to community leaders that a large central structure was needed for the growing crowds. On March 24, 1951, six leaders from the Shaare Zion committee met to discuss the acquisition of land for such a synagogue. They decided on a plot of land on Ocean Parkway and between Avenues T and U – the current site of the building. The same year, they purchased the land and later in 1953, architectural plans were drawn up for the present structure.|$|E

All that was required of Hordern in his next role, the wealthy but terminally ill landowner Peter Featherstone in the BBC adaptation Middlemarch, was for him simply to lie in bed and pretend to die. It was the kind of role which he found to be most fitting for someone of his advanced years and confirmed to him that the older he got, the more typecast he became. It was a situation that did not altogether bother him as he felt grateful for being employable at the age of 81.|$|E
