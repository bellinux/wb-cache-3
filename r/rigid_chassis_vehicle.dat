40|$|Hand calculations, {{finite element}} (FE) {{analysis}} and experimental validation of chassis mounted platform design for defence and commercial off-road vehicles have been attempted in this work. The work was commenced with the thorough study of platform configuration, loading pattern, platform mount location & configuration on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>chassis</b> and relevant <b>vehicle</b> characteristics. Calculation of section modulus, shear force and bending moment of various structural members under specified loading {{has been carried}} out before proceeding with the FE modeling and analysis of platform. FE model of the chassis mounted platform has been made using shell elements and the boundary conditions have been imposed based on the loading pattern with an assumption of <b>rigid</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>chassis.</b> Static and gradient analyses of the platform have been carried out for full scale and reduced scale prototype FE models. Experimental strain measurement at critical locations under different static and gradient loads {{has been carried out}} for design validation of chassis mounted platform using the scaled prototype. Close correlation has been found between the experimental stress values and FE stress analysis results for static and gradient load conditions. From the entire load tests conducted, it is observed that the strain values in rear portion are less as compared with those in front and mid portions of the platform in-spite of the rear overhang provision.

Finite element analysis involved static loading on <b>vehicle</b> <b>chassis.</b> The scope of this study include identifying location of high stress area and evaluate the torsional stiffness of the chassis. CAD design for the chassis is carried out using Solid works version 2012 and FEA prediction is performed using Comsol multiphysics version 4. 2. The result show that the high concentration stress likely to occur at the joints and specific area. The magnitude the stresses depend on the material properties and size of the chassis.

At first they had a centrally mounted boom on the front section, with the driver's cab on the rear section, as in the Teleram 40, but the <b>rigid</b> <b>chassis</b> design with a rear-mounted boom and cab to the side has become more popular.|$|R
50|$|The Tipo 61 was {{the most}} well known model but Giulio Alfieri {{designed}} 5 different models, all based on an intricate multi-tubular frame concept. This multi-tubular construction produced a light weight and <b>rigid</b> <b>chassis</b> that was a significant competitive advantage for a racing car. All models included independent front suspension, 4-wheel disc brakes and 5-speed transmission. A De Dion type rear axle was used on the Tipo 60 and 61.|$|R

[...] The bike provided a sporty though easily manageable ride. The combination of light weight, <b>rigid</b> <b>chassis,</b> strong handling, and the V-twin's strong mid-range torque appealed to beginner and experienced riders alike. The 2003 SV1000 was marketed it as a bigger alternative to the second generation SV650.|$|R
2500|$|Mallet {{also worked}} out schemes for {{compounds}} with independent divided drive for HP and LP, some {{with a single}} <b>rigid</b> <b>chassis</b> that were never built, others with a <b>rigid</b> rear <b>chassis</b> on which the HP cylinders were mounted and an articulated LP front engine unit. The latter arrangement was adopted worldwide. The first application {{was a series of}} 600mm gauge locomotives specially built by the Decauville Company for the Paris Exposition of 1889; the design was introduced to the North American railroading in 1900 with B No. 2400, and rapidly became popular there. US practice progressed to the [...] "simple Mallet", which used the same articulated arrangement but eliminated the compounding. Both simple and compound Mallet locomotives lasted to the end of steam.|$|R

25|$|Locomotives {{with total}} adhesion, {{where all of}} the wheels are coupled together, {{generally}} lack stability at speed. To counter this, locomotives often fit unpowered carrying wheels mounted on two-wheeled trucks or four-wheeled bogies centred by springs that help to guide the locomotive through curves. These usually take on weight – of the cylinders at the front or the firebox at the rear — when the width exceeds that of the mainframes. For multiple coupled-wheels on a <b>rigid</b> <b>chassis,</b> a variety of systems for controlled side-play exist.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} cars built between 1896 and 1898 {{were reportedly}} initially based on Benz Viktorias, using a single cylinder, 2.9-litre, 4.5 hp petrol engine. From 1899 over 400 articulated front-wheel drive 'Victoria Combinations' (also {{known as the}} Eureka) were manufactured at 10 Avenue de la Grande Armée. From 1900-1901 the Duc-Spider and Duc-Tonneau were more conventional models, with the engine mounted in the <b>rigid</b> <b>chassis</b> and driving the rear wheels via a propeller shaft. The 'Duc' (Duke) models used Aster engines of 5,000cc or 6,500cc.|$|R
2500|$|These design {{choices were}} carried {{over to the}} {{characteristic}} [...] "Bianchi Line" [...] inspired by the locomotives and systems already used in Switzerland.

5000|$|In 1876 he {{introduced}} {{a series of}} small 2-cylinder compound 0-4-2 tank locomotives for the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz Railway in France. He subsequently designed an articulated compound system with a <b>rigid</b> <b>chassis</b> at the rear carrying two high-pressure cylinders plus two low-pressure ones mounted on an articulated front driving truck, patented in 1884 with full rights granted in 1885. This was first used for a series of [...] narrow gauge locomotives specially built by the Decauville Company in 1888 for the Paris Exposition of 1889. This arrangement became known as the Mallet locomotive.|$|R
5000|$|The M100 Elan's {{cornering}} {{performance was}} undeniable (on release the Elan {{was described by}} Autocar magazine as [...] "the quickest point to point car available"). Press reaction was not uniformly positive, as some reviewers found the handling too secure and predictable compared to a rear-wheel-drive car. However, the Elan's <b>rigid</b> <b>chassis</b> minimised roll through the corners and has led to its description as 'the finest front wheel drive car bar none'. Unlike the naturally aspirated version, the turbocharged SE received power steering as standard, as well as tyres with a higher ZR speed rating.|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{locomotives}} were of 2-2-2 wheel arrangement {{to accommodate}} the extra length. However, with the outside cylinders, the engines were extremely unsteady, swaying from side to side. This led Stephenson to bring the rear wheels forward in the 4-2-0 formation, with the cylinders between the leading wheels. Such an engine was the [...] "Great A" [...] which {{took part in the}} Gauge Trials. This however, left the firebox behind the wheels and was therefore limited in size and weight. Moreover, the long <b>rigid</b> <b>chassis</b> made bends difficult to negotiate and damaged the track.|$|R

To compare {{the possibility of}} tip over around different axes, a Moment-Height Stability (MHS) measure method {{is used to calculate}} the stability of vehicle on the deck. The MHS result shows compartments of the instability around each edge, which is a good supplement to the tire force method...|$|R
