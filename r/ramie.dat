5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting to be quiet, without struggle, and voluntary {{even though it}} is inevitable. At the same time, he considers the separation of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. <b>Ramie</b> Targoff argues that this is not because he sees the separation of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{resources}} and fibres from plants {{are used to}} construct dwellings and to manufacture clothing. Wood is used not only for buildings, boats, and furniture, but also for smaller items such as musical instruments and sports equipment. Wood is pulped to make paper and cardboard. Cloth is often made from cotton, flax, <b>ramie</b> or synthetic fibres such as rayon and acetate derived from plant cellulose. Thread used to sew cloth likewise comes in large part from cotton.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 3rd century, sewing, {{followed}} later by weaving, {{was introduced to}} Japan from Korea. Early textiles were made of simple twisted cords from wisteria, mulberry, hemp or <b>ramie</b> fibres. Following a gift of silk clothes and silk worms from the Chinese court, the Japanese court started to support textile and silk production from the 4th century onward. Chinese and Korean weavers were encouraged to exhibit their fabrics bringing new techniques such as those used to make brocades or delicate silk gauzes. In the 8th century Nara period, Japanese weavers employed {{a variety of techniques}} such as tie-dyeing, stenciling, batik, and embroidery. They skillfully imitated continental weaves, including rich damasks, many types of brocades and chiffon-like gauzes. Because of a general change in aesthetics in the Heian period weaving and dyeing techniques became less varied with less colourful brocades, smaller patterns, and less elaborate gauzes. The Japanese aristocracy preferred plain silks over woven or dyed designs. A total of seven National Treasures have been designated in the weaving and dyeing category, including: two mandalas, two monk's surplices or kesa, one brocade, one embroidery with a Buddhist motif and a set of garments presented to a shrine.|$|E

25|$|In {{constructing}} the Prius, Toyota used a new range of plant-derived ecological bioplastics, {{made out of}} cellulose derived from wood or grass instead of petroleum. The two principal crops used are kenaf and <b>ramie.</b> Kenaf {{is a member of}} the hibiscus family, a relative to cotton and okra; <b>ramie,</b> commonly known as China grass, {{is a member of the}} nettle family and one of the strongest natural fibres, with a density and absorbency comparable to flax. Toyota says this is a particularly timely breakthrough for plant-based eco-plastics because 2009 is the United Nations' International Year of Natural Fibres, which spotlights kenaf and <b>ramie</b> among others.|$|E

25|$|Fine Art: Strengths of CHF’s fine-art {{collection}} {{include the}} Fisher Scientific International Collection and the Roy Eddleman Collection, more than 90 paintings and 200 {{works on paper}} that unmask {{the world of the}} alchemists. In their pursuit of the elusive philosophers’ stone, alchemists created a body of knowledge about the material world through experiments and lab work, setting the stage for modern chemistry. Other highlights of the fine-art collection include oil paintings depicting such early modern chemical activities as distillation and metallurgy and watercolors showing the production process of the textile <b>ramie.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Vanessa indica is not {{reported}} as a pest on any crop but on <b>ramie</b> it causes considerable damage by feeding on young tender leaves which affect {{the growth of}} the plant. The larvae of this insect feed on tender young leaves as shown in the picture. The adults lay the eggs on tender leaves in which larvae emerge and feeds on young tender leaves preferably at neck region of the leaves, due to this leaves look like the hanging like position and latter get dry. The caterpillar feeds on young leaves and later fold the leaves {{in such a way that}} both the margins are attached by a silky web and pupation takes place inside the folded leaf. Later the adult emerges as a butterfly.|$|E
500|$|For clothing, silken robes {{were worn}} by the wealthy and elite while hemp and <b>ramie</b> was {{worn by the}} poor; by the late Song period cotton clothes were also in use. Shipment of all these {{materials}} and goods was aided by the 10th century innovation of the canal pound lock in China; the Song scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (10311095) wrote that the building of pound lock gates at Zhenzhou (presumably Kuozhou along the Yangtze) during the 1020s and 1030s freed up the use of five hundred working laborers at the canal each year, amounting to the saving of up to 1,250,000 strings of cash annually. He wrote that the old method of hauling boats over limited {{the size of the}} cargo to 300tan of rice per vessel (roughly [...] ), but after the pound locks were introduced, boats carrying 400tan (roughly [...] ) could then be used. Shen wrote that by his time (c. 1080) government boats could carry cargo weights of up to 700tan (...) , while private boats could hold as much as 800bags, each weighing 2tan (i.e. a total of [...] ).|$|E

The Tang poets also wrote Ci verses set to the tunes for dances such as the [...] "Boddhisattva Barbarian" [...] (...) , a processional dance (隊舞) that may have several hundred performers.|$|E
2500|$|After 1912, {{with the}} {{development}} of the Art Deco style, Charvet, along with fashion designer Paul Poiret, started to commission art work from the French painter Raoul Dufy, the [...] "granddaddy of modem chic", through the French weaver Bianchini-Férier. Some of the first were related to the war, such as Les Alliés or the Victory Rooster (Figure, left). This was followed by more silk squares, woven silk fabrics for vests, and printed <b>ramie</b> fabrics for dressing gowns and shirts. Some famous customers of the period were fashion designer Coco Chanel and the Maharadjah of Patiala who once placed a single order of 86 dozen shirts.|$|E
2500|$|Shirts {{are made}} of woven cloth. The natural fibers {{used in the past}} were cotton (the most frequent), linen (the oldest), <b>ramie,</b> wool or silk. Nowadays, {{artificial}} fibers such as polyester or polyester blends are often used, due to their low cost, despite being considered by most shirtmakers the poorest material, owing to less softness and breathability. However, while high quality cotton shirts can survive with care a few decades, a polyester/cotton blend may be used in more demanding environments. Linen produces a cool fabric that wrinkles heavily, and is mostly used in light summer shirts. [...] Cotton is therefore the standard material for all but the cheapest shirts. Silk is occasionally worn, though it is hot to wear and has a marked sheen.|$|E
2500|$|The spun fibers are {{generally}} divided into animal fibers, plant and synthetic fibers. [...] These fiber types are chemically different, corresponding to proteins, carbohydrates and synthetic polymers, respectively. [...] Animal fibers include silk, but generally are long hairs of {{animals such as}} sheep (wool), goat (angora, or cashmere goat), rabbit (angora), llama, alpaca, dog, cat, camel, yak, and muskox (qiviut). [...] Plants used for fibers include cotton, flax (for linen), bamboo, <b>ramie,</b> hemp, jute, nettle, raffia, yucca, coconut husk, banana fiber, soy and corn. [...] Rayon and acetate fibers are also produced from cellulose mainly derived from trees. [...] Common synthetic fibers include acrylics, polyesters such as dacron and ingeo, nylon and other polyamides, and olefins such as polypropylene. [...] Of these types, wool is generally favored for knitting, chiefly owing to its superior elasticity, warmth and (sometimes) felting; however, wool is generally less convenient to clean {{and some people are}} allergic to it. [...] It is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk. [...] Even within a type of fiber, there can be great variety in the length and thickness of the fibers; for example, Merino wool and Egyptian cotton are favored because they produce exceptionally long, thin (fine) fibers for their type.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ramie</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} fiber crops, having been used for at least six {{thousand}} years, and is principally used for fabric production. It is a bast fiber, and the part used is the bark (phloem) of the vegetative stalks. <b>Ramie</b> is normally harvested two to three times a year but under good growing conditions can be harvested up to six times per year. Unlike other bast crops, <b>ramie</b> requires chemical processing to de-gum the fiber.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ramie</b> ( [...] , [...] ) is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} nettle family Urticaceae, native to eastern Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial growing to 1 - 2.5 m tall; the leaves are heart-shaped, 7 - 15 cm long and 6 - 12 cm broad, and white on the underside with dense small hairs—this gives it a silvery appearance; unlike stinging nettles, the hairs do not sting. The true <b>ramie</b> or China grass, is also called Chinese plant or white <b>ramie.</b>|$|E
50|$|A second type, {{known as}} green <b>ramie</b> or rhea, is {{believed}} to have originated in the Malay Peninsula. It has smaller leaves which are green on the underside, and it appears to be better suited to tropical conditions. The word <b>ramie</b> is derived from the Malay word rami.|$|E
50|$|Shenyi {{in later}} dynasties {{directly}} {{descended from the}} shenyi worn in earlier dynasties, like Han Dynasty. Shenyi originally is made of <b>ramie</b> cultivated in China. <b>Ramie</b> fabric needs to be bleached and produced 45 to 60 centimeters wide textile. The yi (衣, blouse) and chang (裳, skirt) of the shenyi is sewn together. The upper part {{is made up of}} 4 panels of <b>ramie</b> fabric, representing four seasons of a year. 2 panels are fold and sewn to cover the upper body. Another 2 panels of <b>ramie</b> fabric are sewn onto each side of the yi as two sleeves. The lower part is made up of 12 panels of fabric sewn together (十二片縫合), representing 12 months a year.
