40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} problem of extracting meaningful, {{uncorrelated}} biological modes of variation from tangent space shape coordinates in 2 D and 3 D using non-Euclidean metrics. We adapt the maximum autocorrelation factor analysis and the minimum noise fraction transform to shape decomposition. Furthermore, we study metrics based on <b>repated</b> annotations of a training set. We define a way of assessing the correlation between landmarks contrary to landmark coordinates. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a 2 D data set consisting of outlines of lungs and a 3 D/(4 D) data set consisting of sets of mandible surfaces. In the latter case the end goal is to construct a model for growth prediction and simulation. ...|$|R

Here we present {{evidence}} that the most recent six of the 'Heinrich layers', deposited between 14, 000 and 70, 000 years ago, record marked decreases in sea surface temperature and salinity, decreases in the flux of planktonic forminifera to the sediments, and short-lived, massive discharges of icebergs originating in eastern Canada. The path of the icebergs, clearly marked {{by the presence of}} ice-rafted detrital carbonate, can be traced for more than 3, 000 km - a remarkable distance, attesting to extreme cooling of surface waters and enormous amounts of drifiting ice. The cause of these extreme events is puzzling. They may reflect <b>repated</b> rapid advances of the Laurentide ice sheet, perhaps associated with reductions in air temperatures, yet temperature records from Greenland ice cores appear to exhibit only a weak corresponding signal. Moreover, the 5 - 10, 000 -yr intervals between the events are inconsistent with Milankovitch orbital periodicities, raising the question of what the ultimate cause of the postulated cooling may have been...|$|R

This paper proposes new architectures for numeric function generators (NFGs) using piecewise arithmetic expressions. The proposed architectures are programmable, and they realize a wide range of numeric functions. To design an NFG for a given function, we partition the domain of the function into uniform segments, and transform a subfunction in each segment into a arithmetic spectrum. From this arithmetic spectrum, we derive an arithmetic expression, and realize the arithmetic expression with hardware. Since the arithmetic spectrum has many zero coefficients and <b>repated</b> coefficients, by storing only distinct nonzero coefficients in a table, we can significantly reduce the table size needed to store arithmetic coefficients. Experimental results show that the table size can be reduced to only a small percent of the table size needed to store all the arithmetic coefficients. We also propose techniques to reduce table size further and to improve performance...|$|R
40|$|Learning to {{converge}} to an efficient, i. e., Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium of the repeated game {{is an open}} problem in multiagent learning. Our goal is to facilitate the learning of efficient outcomes in repeated plays of incomplete information games when only opponent’s actions but not its payoffs are observable. We use a two-stage protocol that allows a player to unilaterally commit to an action, allowing the other player to choose an action knowing the action chosen by the committed player. The motivation behind commitment is to promote trust between the players and prevent them from mutually harmful choices made to preclude worst-case outcomes. Our agents learn whether commitment is beneficial or not. Interestingly, the decision to commit {{can be thought of}} as expanding the action space and our proposed protocol can be incorporated by any learning strategies used for playing repeated games. We show the improvement of the outcome efficiency of standard learning algorithms when using our proposed commitment protocol. We propose convergence to pareto optimal Nash equilibrium of repeated games as desirable learning outcomes. The performance evaluation in this paper uses a similarly motivated metric that measures the percentage of Nash equilibria for <b>repated</b> games that dominate the observed outcome...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies in}} a {{probabilistic}} framework some topics concerning the way words (strings) can overlap, and relationship {{of this to}} the depth of a digital tree associated with this set of words. A word {{is defined as a}} (random) sequence of (possibly infinite) symbols over a finite alphabet. By depth of a word (or the associated suffix tree) we mean the average length of a string that can be recopied. In other words, the depth is a measure of compressions for words, and as such finds many applications in computer sciences and telecommunications, most notably in coding theory, theory of languages and design and analysis of algorithms. Our main finding shows that the depth of a word (suffix tree) is asymptotically equivalent to the depth of a set of independent words (i. e., independent tries). More precisely, let us consider the first n suffixes of a random word. Then, the depth of a suffix tree built from these suffixes is normally distributed with the mean 1 /h 1. log n and the variance a. log n where h 1 is entropy of the alphabet, and a is a parameter of the probabilistic model. Finally, we present some consequence of our findings for the design and analysis of algorithms on words. In particular, we consider compression schemes that compress <b>repated</b> patterns by sending pointers to them instead of the patterns themselves, and prove that such a compression is not efficient for random strings...|$|R
40|$|Although {{measurement}} of intracranial pressure by noninvasive methods has been suggested, but mainly invasive methods {{are used for}} this purpose-Increase in episcleral venous pressure {{can be expected to}} result in a linear increase in intraocular pressure. Congested oculat veins with capillary leakage and hemorrhage are seen when the ICP is increased, thus theoretically {{measurement of}} intraocular pressure can be a procedure for estimation of the ICP. This study was performed to find whether there is andy relationship between intraocular pressure and ICP, so we used 12 albino rabbits in two divided groups. Our study was not designed to elucidate the mechanism of change but merely to record any changes observed. All measures except an increase in ICP were applied on the test group {{as well as on the}} control group. After general anesthesia with the combination of ketamin, rampune, and pentobarbital a burr hole was made in the lambda region of the skull and a cannula was placed in the subdural space. The ICP in the test group increased up to 15 mmHg and was constant throughout the experiment. Intraocular pressure was measured by Schiotz tonometers afte general anesthesia, after cannulation of the skull, and immediately after increasing the ICP which was <b>repated</b> in 15 minutes interval for 4 hours. There was no statistical difference between the two groups (P: 0. 997). results show that neither cannulation nor general anesthesia for 4 hours produce alteration in IOP in the control group nor increasing of the ICP to level of 15 mmHg produces any alteration in IOP on the test group...|$|R

The increase of sweet com production may {{be carried out}} by improving the growth and production of this plant by providing required hara element supply. This supply may be implemented by giving compost. The making of compost requires long time; it therefore should be added with stimulator EM 4, namely liquid culture of microorganism like Lactobacillus, Actinomycetes and photosynthesis bacteria which may accelerate the composing process. The problem formulation of this research is whether compost with EM 4 stimulator influences the growth and producyion of sweet com and how many doze of compost with EM 4 stimulator which may give the best result. The aim of the research is to evaluate the effect of compost with EM 4 stimulator against the growth and production of sweet com and also to evaluate the best doze of compost with EM 4 stimulator which may gives the highest result. The research uses Complete Random Design with 4 treatments in which each treatment is <b>repated</b> 5 times. Those treatments are PO (control), P 1 (compost 47, 1 g/polybag), P 2 (compost 94, 2 g/polybag), P 3 (compost 141, 3 g/polybag). The obtained data was analyzed using ANOVA and BNT test when there is a significant difference.

40|$|After {{myocardial}} infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock the inflammatory response {{is the result}} of an ischemic insult. Elevated procalcitonin levels, correlated to IL- 6 levels, are triggered by bacterial toxins. In cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) hypoperfusion of the gut may result in a loss of barrier function and as a consequence bacterial endotoxins may enter the systemic circulation. Alkaline phosphatase is capable of detoxifying endotoxins and extracellular nucleotides. Based on the promising results of alkaline phosphatase in the attenuation of the inflammatory response in several studies we focused in this thesis on the effect of bovine Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (bIAP) on the inflammatory response in the field of cardiology and cardiac surgery. In chapter 2 of this thesis the proposed mechanism of endotoxin release during cardiac surgery with the use of CPB is discussed, followed by both material dependent and material independent measures taken throughout the years to diminish endotoxin release. In chapter 3 we investigated the effect of bIAP in {{myocardial infarction}}. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was induced in mice. BIAP was given intravenously. A single dose of bIAP reduced the production of the chymase mMCP- 1 and diminished the systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine response in the acute phase after AMI. In chapter 4 a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study among a total of 63 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with low till intermediate EuroSCORE is discussed. Bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase or placebo was administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion for 36 hours. Five patients in the placebo group displayed a significant TNFa response followed by an increase in plasma levels of IL- 6 and IL- 8. Such a TNFa response was not observed in the bIAP group, confirming the anti-inflammatory activity of bIAP. In chapter 5 we focused on alkaline phosphatase release. The intravenous administration of bIAP as a bolus followed by continuous infusion to patients undergoing elective CABG with CPB leads to an initial rise of plasma alkaline phosphatase levels followed by a significant increase of plasma alkaline phosphatase at about 4 - 6 hours post start of surgery. This second peak of alkaline phosphatase has an endogenous origin. The most likely source is liver type alkaline phosphatase. To exclude that aprotinin as possible anti-inflammatory agent was the eliciting factor in endogenous alkaline phosphatase release we performed a small study in patients undergoing CABG with the use of CPB, but without the use of aprotinin. This study is described in chapter 6. In this study it is demonstrated that the release of endogenous alkaline phosphatase is not induced by aprotinin, and that it is only induced by bolus bIAP followed by continuous infusion. In piglets bIAP was administered intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously either as a single bolus or as <b>repated</b> bolus twice a day, with an interval of about 8 hours for 3 consecutive days. No endogenous alkaline phosphatase release could be demonstrated in piglet experiments which are described in chapter...|$|R
40|$|The fishery {{investigations}} in northern polar waters {{carried out by}} the Norwegian Fishery Administration have since 1933 been concentrated solely on the deep sea banks off the west coast of Spitsbergen in order to develop and support the commercial fishery which has come into existence here. The fishery investigations carried out annually since 1923 were during a series of years mainly centered upon the waters around Bear Island, with the intention of opening these waters for the commercial fishery, which also succeeded. But the Norwegian fishery interests stretch over the vast area of the Barents Sea - Jan Mayen - Southeast Greenland, and several cruises have been untertaken also in these waters {{in order to get a}} survey of the fishery conditions. On all these cruises fishing vessels or sealing vessels leased for the purpose have been employed, the majority of them being of about 50 gross tons, but also larger vessels have been used. On all the cruises the essential work has of course been to carry out practical fishing experiments, to collect biological and oceanographical material and to obtain information on depth and bottom conditions. Besides these primary tasks we have collected botanical and geological material in localities incidentally visited, and from which little or no material of this kind previously had been collected, as for instance Southeast Greenland, Jan Mayen and many places in the Svalbard area. My coworker on nearly all these cruises, mag. sci. EINAR KOEFOED, has through his wide knowledge and interest added to the value of the material collected. We have also had the opportunity to visit the lonely, arctic Hope Island which lies in the Barents Sea about 115 miles due east of the southern point of Spitsbergen. After my visit to the southern part of Hope Island in 1924 the results were published in the Skrifter om Svalbard og Ishavet, Vol. I, no. 10, Oslo 1926. During our later fishery {{investigations in}} these waters in 1929 and 1930 I had the opportunity to visit also the northern part of the island. During these latter landings I have taken a number of photographs and measured some heights on the island. According to these measurements it has been possible to draw the equidistances more correctly than on my sketch map of 1924. The localities which have been paid most attention in 1929 and 1930 are Hermansenskardet (Hermansen Gap) with Småhumpen (Small Hummock), ancl Bråstadskardet (Bråstad Gap) with Lyngefjellet (Lynge Hill). Some measurements of the sun's altitude were also taken. The distance between the south and north points, and the distances between the different mountains and gaps were determined by sailing to and from along the coast and using the patent log. On the basis of the observations taken in 1924 and in 1929 - 1930 I have made a new sketch map of Hope Island (fig. 36). On this new sketch map the south point has been shifted 4 miles to the south and 1 mile to the west. Hope Island is 18 miles long, i. e. 2 miles shorter than on the previous sketch map, and the angle formed by the longitudinal direction of the island with the meridian is somewhat larger. The measurements of the sun's altitude taken at one and the same spot on various occasions show differences on account of bad horizon, and I have therefore been compelled to use the mean values. On account of the varying tide currcnts I have also had to use the mean of the distances sailed along the coast from the south to the north points. These investigations on Hope Island have been carried out when the opportunity arose, and they must be considered only as a small contribution to the discription of the island. An accurate survey of Hope Island is still lacking. In accounts dealing with the whaling period in Spitsbergen waters walrus is mentioned at Hope Island. Walrus is not found at the island nowadays, although single specimens may be encountered here as well as in many other localities in the Svalbard area, and even at the Norwegian coast. The great quantities of skeletal fragments of walrus found at Koefoed Point might be remains from walrus slaughtered in the whaling period. However, by a closer study of these remains I am mostly inclined to believe that a catastrophe has occurred here once or <b>repated</b> times. The skeletal fragments are found partly scattered on the soil surface, but a great part of them are overgrown by vegetation. The size of the craniums shows that they belong to walrus of all age-groups, even new-borns. In many craniums the tusks are fixed in their proper place. As a whole I got the impression that these skeletal fragments were not remains of slaughtered animals. If, however, a natural catastrophe has occurred it might be explained thus: Near the south point of Hope Island the Koefoed point juts out eastwards as a low, grass-clad spit of land with a flat beach. Steep mountain sides mark the bounds on all other sides of this point. A large herd of walrus has been assembled on Koefoed Point during a strong and protracted gale blowing on the shore. This gale has pushed the drift-ice ashore, piling it up into such a high ice-wall that it has been impossible for the Walrus to escape into the sea. The herd has become enclosed for so long time that all the animals ultimately have died from hunger. Hope Island is assumed to be discovered by the Dutchman RIJP who called the island "Visch Eylandt" because he should have found much fish at the southern part of the island. Possibly RIJP by "Visch" meant whales. This mode of expression was at that time common among the whalers, and is even used today by the Norwegian whalers. RIJP was, however, on a voyage of discovery and he was perhaps no whaler, so it is possible that he by "Visch" really meant fish, i. e. cod or haddock or possibly capelan. When we have visited Hope Island we have never seen any indication of fish near the shore, but it is possible that under certain conditions shoals of capelan can be washed ashore, or that cod and haddock can be present in very shallow water near the island. In the 1870 -ies great shoals of cod were found near the beach in the fjords of Spitsbergen and Bear Island, and something similar may have occurred at that time at Hope Island. On August 26. 1923, while steering southwards from Frans Josef land with the M/C "Blåfjell", we encountered on the bank due east of Hope Island a great number of whales gorging in Euphausiidæ and capelan. With a small seine we succeeclecl in catching some hundred liters of capelan. Using the capelan as bait we caught a quantity of cod on long-lines in the same locality. This experiment was repeated a few days later on the edge of the bank southeast of Hope Island, and here very large catches of cod were made. However, these catches were made rather far from the island and in comparatively deep water, namely about 100 fathoms. Also on some occasions after 1923 our fishing experiments on the bank southeast of Hope Island have shown that fish could be found here, and in the last years this fishing region has also been visited by ordinary fishing vessels. When the fishermen get better aquainted with the conditions on Hope Island they may occasionally and under certain weather conditions possibly find it advantageous to seek anchorage to the lee of the island while fishing in this region. It is possible that in the future a meteorological station will be needed on Hope Island, and for this purpose the island seems well suited. In this case Hope Island will be utilised in the same way as the small and lonely Bear Island and Jan Mayen. If there cannot be found very valuable minerals on Hope Island it can hardly be exploited in any other way than for winter hunting or for purposes indicated above. The population of white and blue foxes will perhaps not stand reduction every year, perhaps only every second or third year. It is possible that an interchange occasionally takes place through migration of foxes across the ice from Edge Island or conversely. As for the polar bear the case is somewhat different, as it does not inhabit the island all the year round. The polar bear visits the island together with the drift-ice. It is only a few single individuals, perhaps some quite inexperienced young bears, which let the ice drift away from the island without jumping on to it in time. They stay on the island, often vegetating for long periods in summer, till the drift-ice again touches the shore...|$|R
