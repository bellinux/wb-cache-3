40|$|The next {{international}} {{version of}} the System of National Accounts will recommend that R&D (Research and Development) expenditures be capitalized instead of being immediately expensed as in the present System of National Accounts 1993. An R&D project creates a new technology, which in principle does not depreciate like a <b>reproducible</b> <b>asset.</b> A new technology is however subject to obsolescence, which acts {{in a manner that}} is somewhat similar to depreciation. The paper looks at the net benefits of an R&D project in the context of a very simple intertemporal general equilibrium model and suggests that R&D expenditures be amortized using the matching principle that has been developed in the accounting literature to match the fixed costs of a project to a stream of future benefits. Of particular interest is the evaluation of the net benefits of a publicly funded project where the results are made freely available to the public. Cost benefit analysis, R&D project, intertemporal general equilibrium theory, money metric utility scaling, matching principle, amortization, deprecia...|$|E

40|$|Evaluating the {{sustainability}} of a society requires a system of shadow or accounting values derived from {{the sustainability}} objective. As {{a first step toward}} the derivation of such shadow values for a maximin objective, this paper studies an economy composed of two <b>reproducible</b> <b>assets,</b> each producing one of two consumption goods. The effect of the substitutability between goods in utility is studied by postulating, in turn, neoclassical diminishing marginal substitutability, perfect substitutability and perfect complementarity. The degree of substitutability has strong effects on the maximin solution, affecting the regularity or non-regularity of the program, and on the accounting values. This has important consequences for the computation of genuine savings and the sustainability prospects of future generations...|$|R
40|$|Economists and {{economic}} historians {{tend to use}} the terms capital and machinery interchangeably, even though machinery rarely constitutes one-fifth and sometimes is as little as one-tenth of a nation’s <b>reproducible</b> tangible <b>assets.</b> This habit can distort the way economists think and talk about important issues. In economic history, disproportionate attention to machinery helps explain why the “Habakkuk” debate, which has now spanned several decades, has been premised {{on the need to}} rationalize empirical regularities the opposite of those in need of explanation. In manufacturing and, indeed, in the economy in the aggregate, the United States was less, not more capital intensive than Britain in 1860...|$|R
