25|$|With the {{reverser}} in mid {{gear position}} since {{there should be}} no superimposed return crank motion, the expansion link die slot should be an arc of a circle centred on the pivot in mid gear and of radius equal to the length of the <b>radius</b> <b>rod.</b> This condition precludes adjustment of the valve gear by altering the length of the <b>radius</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{lay out the}} Walschaerts gear, the {{proportions}} of the combination lever must be chosen. The total movement of the valve rod in mid gear should be symmetric between front and back dead centre. A displacement of the union link end by half the piston travel must cause a valve rod displacement of the valve lead plus the valve lap. The ratio of distance from union link end to pivot with <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> to {{the distance between the}} valve rod end to the pivot with the <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> should be in the same proportion as half piston travel to valve lap plus lead.|$|E
25|$|For space reasons, Oldsmobile adopted torsion {{bars for}} the Toronado's front {{suspension}} (the first GM passenger car application of torsion bars in the US, but {{still did not}} duplicate Packard's automatic ride leveling system. On a side note, European Opel and Vauxhall divisions used torsion bars in the 1930s and 1940s), with conventional, unequal-length double wishbones. Rear Toronado suspension was a simple beam axle on single leaf springs, unusual only in having dual shock absorbers, one vertical, one horizontal (allowing it {{to act as a}} <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> to control wheel movement).|$|E

25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
2500|$|The Mason Bogie was still, though, {{plagued by}} one of the biggest {{problems}} of the Fairlie - the jointed steam pipes to the driven truck leaked far too much steam. Mason eventually changed to a different scheme, in which the pivot point for the leading truck became a hollow ball joint through which the live steam for the cylinders passed. [...] Mason also developed a sliding seal for the exhaust from the moving cylinder saddle into the smoke box. Although better, Mason's improvements took up much valuable space in between the driving wheels, forcing Mason to use an outside valve gear, generally the Walschaerts valve gear. Additionally, the reversing shaft had to be mounted atop the boiler, with a long lifting link dropping down to the <b>radius</b> <b>rod,</b> a feature unique to Mason Bogies (this was necessary because the lifting link would swing to the side as the truck pivoted, lifting the <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> and changing the valve setting. [...] Lengthening the link, and thus increasing the radius of its swing, minimized the amount of change.).|$|E
2500|$|The 370Z uses a front double {{wishbone}} suspension, with forged aluminum control arms and steering knuckle, the rear multi-link suspension uses a forged aluminum upper control arm, lower arm and <b>radius</b> <b>rod,</b> the toe control rod is steel and wheel carrier assembly is aluminum. [...] The refreshed 2013 model uses new dampers with the Sport package models. The brakes {{have been changed}} from the more expensive Brembo racing brakes to Nissan branded brakes which are manufactured by Akebono.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} system uses Land Rover Discovery beam axles front and rear. The front axles are located by <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> and a Panhard rod. The rear axle is located by trailing arms and Watt's linkage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Radius</b> <b>rods</b> are customarily made of stamped {{steel or}} {{aluminum}} for lightness, {{as they are}} part of the vehicle's unsprung weight. Improvements in composite materials technology make possible plastic suspension links, although they are still uncommon.|$|R
50|$|Suspension is {{conventional}} by unequal length wishbones and coil over damper at {{the front}} and by coil sprung live rear axle at the rear which is located by a transverse link (Panhard rod) and two pairs of forward extending <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> to react braking and acceleration and to control axle wind-up.|$|R
50|$|In MacPherson's {{original}} design, an {{anti-roll bar}} also acted as the <b>radius</b> <b>rod.</b> This requires {{the bar to}} be attached through a ball joint, so as to also provide longitudinal control. In most contemporary designs, still commonly termed MacPherson struts, the <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> and anti-roll bar are now separate, with the anti-roll bar mounted in a sliding bush.|$|E
50|$|With the {{reverser}} in mid {{gear position}} since {{there should be}} no superimposed return crank motion, the expansion link die slot should be an arc of a circle centred on the pivot in mid gear and of radius equal to the length of the <b>radius</b> <b>rod.</b> This condition precludes adjustment of the valve gear by altering the length of the <b>radius</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E

50|$|A beam axle's {{fore and}} aft {{location}} is constrained by either: trailing arms, semi-trailing arms, <b>radius</b> <b>rods,</b> or leaf springs. The lateral location is constrained by either: a Panhard rod, a Scott Russell linkage or a Watt's linkage. While shock absorbers and either leaf springs, coil springs, or air bags are used to control vertical movement.|$|R
50|$|Other {{suspension}} components {{can be made}} to act as <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> {{under certain}} conditions. For example, the rear suspension of the original 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado used shock absorbers to connect the rear beam axle to the frame; these shocks controlled longitudinal wheel movement, but their damping action prevented the forces of those movements from being felt by the passengers.|$|R
50|$|Under the new body, {{the running}} gear {{was very similar}} to the 1966 Cortina. The rear {{suspension}} employed a live axle supported on leaf springs with short <b>radius</b> <b>rods.</b> MacPherson struts were featured at the front in combination with rack and pinion steering which employed a steering column that would collapse in response to a collision.|$|R

50|$|In forward motion, {{the yoke}} was pushed forward, {{so that its}} upper pivot {{was in front of}} the bell crank-main link connection. Moving the {{eccentric}} arm back and forth lowered and raised the top of the main link. This motion was translated by the bellcrank into back and forth motion of the <b>radius</b> <b>rod.</b> The angle of the yoke controlled the relative motion, and therefore the cutoff; tilting the yoke backwards reversed the motion of the <b>radius</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Early {{examples}} {{continued to}} use the chain drive and independent suspension in the rear. 752 roadsters and 242 coupés were then produced. After that Honda switched to a conventional drive-shaft, live axle rear end with four <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> and a Panhard rod. [...] 604 roadsters and 69 coupes were built with this setup before disc brakes replaced the front drums.|$|R
5000|$|The {{torque tube}} design is {{typically}} heavier and securely ties {{the rear end}} together, thus providing for a rigid rear and assuring good alignment under all conditions.

50|$|In 1957, the {{lightweight}} Goggomobil used a similar suspension design to the Scarab. Much simpler though, the Goggomobil had bare drive shafts that also acted as the suspension links, with suspension forces {{passing through the}} inboard Hooke joints. The swing axle shafts were only carried by the trailing <b>radius</b> <b>rods,</b> rather than an axle casing, and the long struts were shortened to a simple coilover shock absorber.|$|R
50|$|To {{lay out the}} Walschaerts gear, the {{proportions}} of the combination lever must be chosen. The total movement of the valve rod in mid gear should be symmetric between front and back dead centre.

50|$|Most {{control arms}} form the lower link of a suspension. A few designs {{use them as}} the upper link, usually with a lower wishbone. The {{additional}} <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> is then attached to the upper arm.|$|E
50|$|Problems often {{arise in}} {{incorporating}} a Walschaerts valve gear {{into the design}} of tank and narrow gauge locomotives because of space limitations. The reversing rod (with its lifting arm), needed to change between forward and reverse running, is therefore mounted {{at the same level}} as the pivot of the expansion link. This enables the lifting link (German: Hängeeisen) to be dispensed with, and the lifting arm to be connected directly to the <b>radius</b> <b>rod.</b> To ensure the required horizontal movement, the back end of the <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> is designed as a slide (the 'Kuhn slide') which fits into a rotatable crosshead (Gleitstein) in the lifting arm.|$|E
50|$|The alloy/steel tub of the T332 {{followed}} standard Lola design {{practice with}} twin bulkheads and utilised a semi-stressed engine and transmission. Twin side radiators were mounted {{in front of}} the rear wheels which were located by upper and lower links and <b>radius</b> <b>rods.</b> Driven through a Hewland DG300 five-speed transmission, a Chevrolet powered T332 was once timed at 305 km/h at the now closed Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California.|$|R
25|$|Another {{design was}} {{patented}} in 1894 by inventors John Buchanan and Alexander Gordon from Melbourne, Australia. The construction {{was based on}} a frame of spiral wires covered with waterproof material. The design was improved by Alexander Gordon by attaching the suit to the helmet and other parts and incorporating jointed <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> in the limbs. This resulted in a flexible suit which could withstand high pressure. The suit was manufactured by British firm Siebe Gorman and trialed in Scotland in 1898.|$|R
50|$|Only one Koach {{was made}} for the {{television}} series and feature film. It was made from three Ford Model T bodies and is 18 feet long. The 133-inch frame was made by hand, as were the brass radiator and fenders. It has blood red interior and black pearl paint. It took 500 hours to hand form the ornate rolled steel scrollwork. The front end had a dropped axle, split <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> and T springs. Its design featured a custom hearse body.|$|R
50|$|A {{bellcrank}} whose center pivot was the upper, forward mount on the frame, {{and whose}} ends {{were attached to}} the top of the main link and the <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> (the connection to the combination arm and thence to the valve).|$|E
50|$|The Chapman strut {{is often}} {{confused}} with the MacPherson strut, as both use a near-vertical upper strut, The distinction is that the MacPherson strut always requires a lower track control arm where the Chapman uses the drive shaft and a light <b>radius</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{place of}} the usual rear solid axle, there is {{independent}} suspension from lower wishbones, the original trailing arms, an upper strut and an anti-roll bar. At the front a <b>radius</b> <b>rod</b> on each side {{was added to the}} standard double wishbones.|$|E
500|$|The chassis {{was based}} on a pressed steel ladder frame with channel-section side members and {{fabricated}} and tubular cross members. Suspension was by semi-elliptic leaf springs and Watson Stabilator dampers front and rear, with a tubular beam axle at the front and a live axle and <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> at the rear. The standard wheelbase was , [...] with a wheelbase of [...] available for seven-passenger bodies. The front and rear tracks were both [...] wide. Center-locking wire wheels with 5" [...] x 33" [...] tires were used front and rear.|$|R
50|$|The Farman III was, {{like the}} Voisin, an equal-span pusher biplane {{with a single}} forward {{elevator}} and biplane tail surfaces carried on booms. Farman's design eliminated the covered nacelle for the pilot which also carried the elevator in the Voisin: instead the elevator was mounted on two pairs of converging booms. Lateral control was effected by ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The undercarriage also differed considerably, replacing the pair of wheels {{with a pair of}} skids each carrying a pair of wheels sprung using bungee cord and restrained by <b>radius</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{chassis frame}} has an {{underframe}} {{designed to make}} {{a unit of the}} engine and gearbox both of which are supported by it along the full length of both their sides. Suspension is by semi-elliptic springs all round. At the rear universal-jointed <b>radius</b> <b>rods</b> tie the rear-axle casing to the chassis frame. A triangular torque rod held at its front end by a spring buffer resists the reaction of driving and braking. Internal expanding brakes are fitted to the rear wheels together with an external hinged shoe brake behind the gear box.|$|R
