25|$|A female Asian golden cat at the Washington Park Zoo (now the Oregon Zoo) {{showed a}} {{dramatic}} increase in the frequency of scent marking during estrus. At the same time, she often <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> neck and head on inanimate objects. She also repeatedly approached the male in the cage, rubbed on him, and adopted a receptive posture (lordosis) in front of him. The male's rate of scent marking increased during this time, as did his frequency of approaching and following the female. The male's mounting behavior included a nape bite, but in contrast to other small felids, the bite was not sustained.|$|E
25|$|Genie's father fed Genie {{as little}} as {{possible}} and refused to give her solid food, feeding her only baby food, cereal, Pablum, an occasional soft-boiled egg, and liquids. Her father, or when coerced her brother, spooned food into her mouth as quickly as possible, and if she choked or could not swallow fast enough the person feeding her <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> face in her food. These were normally the only times he allowed his wife to be with Genie, although she could not feed Genie herself. Genie's mother claimed her husband always fed Genie three times a day but also said that Genie sometimes risked a beating by making noise when hungry, leading researchers to believe he often refused to feed her. In early 1972 Genie's mother told researchers that at night, when possible, at around 11 PM she surreptitiously tried to give Genie additional food, causing Genie to develop an abnormal sleep pattern in which she slept from 7 to 11 PM, woke up for a few minutes, and fell back asleep for an additional 6 hours. This pattern continued for several months after removal from captivity.|$|E
2500|$|After Making the Band 4 - The Tour and {{the release}} of the first single [...] "Damaged," [...] Danity Kane once again {{encountered}} rumors of a breakup, largely spurred by scenes from the Making the Band series featuring their mentor Sean Combs sparring with O'Day over her dance performance and desire to create her own image separate from the group. On the August 28, 2008 episode of Making the Band, Combs, frustrated with the [...] "oversexed" [...] image he felt O'Day now showcased, he called O'Day [...] "one of the worst dancers" [...] in Danity Kane, when she used to be [...] "one of the best." [...] He told O'Day that she no longer looked like the girl he signed. Combs bluntly accused O'Day of trying to expand her fame {{at the expense of the}} entire group, and that she liked flaunting her breasts and wearing big hair. O'Day had boasted about her cleavage to former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) [...] guru and current SunSport broadband television producer/host Paul Heyman of The Heyman Hustle in order to validate her breasts as natural. In a controversial act, she <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> cleavage on Heyman's arm. Furious, Combs asked himself on television why he was keeping O'Day in the group. With O'Day forgoing promotional appearances with the group to appear as Amber Von Tussle on Broadway's Hairspray, speculation arose that O'Day's role in the group had been marginalized. On September 7, 2008, however, the group appeared together at the MTV Video Music Awards to help present the Best New Artist Award.|$|E
