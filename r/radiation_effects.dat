The sample of an eight-year-old girl contained 1.13 becquerels/liter. The children were living up to 60kilometers away from the troubled nuclear power plant. The Fukushima Network for Saving Children urged the Japanese government to check the children in Fukushima. The Japanese non-profit <b>Radiation</b> <b>Effects</b> Research Foundation said that people should not overreact, because there are no reports known of health problems with these levels of radiation.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} of the radiation received at a given location also varies with distance from the explosion. Near {{the point of the}} explosion, the neutron intensity is greater than the gamma intensity, but with increasing distance the neutron-gamma ratio decreases. Ultimately, the neutron component of initial radiation becomes negligible in comparison with the gamma component. The range for significant levels of initial radiation does not increase markedly with weapon yield and, as a result, the initial radiation becomes less of a hazard with increasing yield. With larger weapons, above 50 kt (200 TJ), blast and thermal effects are so much greater in importance that prompt <b>radiation</b> <b>effects</b> can be ignored.|$|E
25|$|The <b>radiation</b> <b>effects</b> {{from the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear {{disaster}} are the observed and predicted effects {{resulting from the}} release of radioactive isotopes from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Radioactive isotopes were released from reactor containment vessels {{as a result of}} venting to reduce gaseous pressure, and the discharge of coolant water into the sea. This resulted in Japanese authorities implementing a 20km exclusion zone around the power plant, and the continued displacement of approximately 156,000 people as of early 2013. Trace quantities of radioactive particles from the incident, including iodine-131 and caesium-134/137, have since been detected around the world.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was {{planning}} on stopping funding for the ABCC's work in Japan. However, James V. Neel made an appeal and the AEC decided to fund them $20,000 a year, for three years, to continue research. In 1956, Neel and William J. Schull published their final draft of The Effect of Exposure to the Atomic Bombs on Pregnancy Termination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This monograph gave {{a detailed description of}} all the data they had collected Despite their efforts, trust in the ABCC was declining, so the ABCC became the <b>Radiation</b> <b>Effects</b> Research Foundation (RERF), and with the new name and administrative organization, funding for the research on survivors was to be provided equally by the United States and Japan. The RERF was established on 1 April 1975. A binational organization run by both the United States and Japan, the RERF is still in operation today.|$|E

25|$|Reliable {{projections}} for CNS risks from space radiation exposure cannot {{be made at}} this time due to a paucity of data on the subject. Existing animal and cellular data do suggest that space radiation can produce neurological and behavioral effects; therefore, {{it is possible that}} mission operations will be impacted. The significance of these results on the morbidity to astronauts has not been elucidated, however. It is to be noted that studies, to date, have been carried out with relatively small numbers of animals (<10 per dose group); this means that testing of dose threshold effects at lower doses (<0.5 Gy) has not yet been carried out to a sufficient extent. As the problem of extrapolating space <b>radiation</b> <b>effects</b> in animals to humans will be a challenge for space radiation research, such research could become limited by the population size that is typically used in animal studies. Furthermore, the role of dose protraction has not been studied to date. An approach has not been discovered to extrapolate existing observations to possible cognitive changes, performance degradation, or late CNS effects in astronauts. Research on new approaches to risk assessment may be needed to provide the data and knowledge that will be necessary to develop risk projection models of the CNS from space radiation. A vigorous research program, which will be required to solve these problems, must rely on new approaches to risk assessment and countermeasure validation because of the absence of useful human radio-epidemiology data in this area.|$|E

Despite the insignificance of birth defects found in Neel's study and the detailed medical literature, up to 1987, historians such as Ronald E. Powaski frequently wrote that Hiroshima experienced [...] "an increase in stillbirths, birth defects, and infant mortality" [...] following the atomic bomb.|$|E

In 1959, Karl-Heinz Hinkelmann produced the first reasonable primitive equation forecast, 37 years after Richardson's failed attempt. Hinkelmann {{did so by}} removing small oscillations from the numerical model during initialization. In 1966, West Germany and the United States began producing operational forecasts based on primitive-equation models, followed by the United Kingdom in 1972 and Australia in 1977. Later additions to primitive equation models allowed additional insight into different weather phenomena. In the United States, solar <b>radiation</b> <b>effects</b> {{were added to the}} primitive equation model in 1967; moisture effects and latent heat were added in 1968; and feedback effects from rain on convection were incorporated in 1971. [...] Three years later, the first global forecast model was introduced. [...] Sea ice began to be initialized in forecast models in 1971. [...] Efforts to involve sea surface temperature in model initialization began in 1972 due to its role in modulating weather in higher latitudes of the Pacific.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{cisplatin}} as {{a potential}} radiosensitizer in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has produced encouraging results in clinical trials. In order to provide information on improving the design of clinical treatments, we investigated the effect of cisplatin dose, and the time interval and sequence between administration of cisplatin and radiation on cell survival of two NPC cell lines, CNE 1 and SUNE 1. When cisplatin was applied first, an exposure time of 24 h resulted in up to 2. 6 -fold increase in cell death and 7 -fold increase in <b>radiation</b> <b>effect</b> (cell survival after cisplatin/cell survival after cisplatin plus radiation) in the cisplatin-radiation combination treatment compared to the cells treated with cisplatin for 4 h. When radiation was applied first, a shorter interval time of 4 h followed by cisplatin treatment resulted in up to 3 -fold increase in cell death and a 3 -fold enhanced <b>radiation</b> <b>effect</b> over longer time intervals of 24 h. By changing the order of radiation and cisplatin treatment alone, a 2 -fold difference in <b>radiation</b> <b>effect</b> was observed. The differential cytotoxicity was partially explained by the alterations in cell cycle distribution. Our results indicate the importance of scheduling the radiation and cisplatin combination regimens on the survival of NPC cells. © 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
