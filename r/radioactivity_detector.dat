The radiochemical purity was sufficiently high with acceptable chemical contaminations (Table 2). The sequencer-controlling radiosynthesis and the inhalation controller allowed a reliable operation and fairly good reproducibility in the production and inhalation of a series of radiopharmaceuticals. The radiochemical contamination was shown to be negligibly small even when the radiopharmaceuticals were supplied at 4.5 -min intervals (Fig.  4). These features allowed the recently developed rapid method of Kudomi et al. [26] applicable to PET imaging under the clinical environment, as has been demonstrated in more than 2500 examinations in our facility since December, 2012. Automatic evacuation of the target gas that was carried immediately after the end of production of a previous radiopharmaceutical was effective to reduce contamination from the previous supply in the second production despite of the short interval. Automatic record of <b>radioactivity</b> <b>detectors,</b> electronic valves, flow meters, the pressure monitoring sensors, together with other monitoring devices needed in PET examinations were aimed to ensure the quality of 15 O-labeled radiopharmaceuticals in routine clinical scans.

40|$|Objectives: 6 -[18 F]Fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA) is used {{to study}} the {{presynaptic}} dopamine synthesis in vivo using PET [1]. Major indications for this tracer are determination of the disease stage in Parkinson as well as detection of various neuroendocrine tumors and their metastases. Prior {{to set up a}} Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant production, the quality control of FDOPA needs to be validated. The radiopharmaceutical needs to meet the specification as described in the European Pharmacopoeia 7. 0 Methods: An Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography UPLC® with an online <b>radioactivity</b> <b>detector</b> was used to measure the concentrations of FDOPA and impurities. For identification of the parent compound and its impurities an UPLC® coupled to a Xevo® G 2 QTof mass spectrometer was used. The different components were separated on an Waters ACQUITY UPLC® HSS T 3 1. 8 μm, 3. 0 x 50 mm analytical column. The eluent is 0. 05 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer pH 2. 5 with an isocratic flow of 0. 8 ml/min. Total run time is 3 minutes. Several calibration samples of FDOPA were measured to determine linearity, reproducibility, stability, LOQ, LOD and the resolution. Furthermore the linearity of the Berthold flowstar LB 513 online <b>radioactivity</b> <b>detector</b> was measured. For identification of the parent compound and impurities, a sample was taken directly after the [18 F]FDOPA synthesis. The measurements with the mass spectrometer were performed in negative resolution mode with an electrospray source in a range from 50 to 1200 Da. The masses of interest of FDOPA, DOPA, 6 -hydroxy- DOPA and FDOPA-quinone (see fig. 1) are respectively 214. 0516, 196. 0610, 212. 0559 and 212. 0359 Da. (Figure presented) Results: The analyses using UPLC® in combination with online <b>radioactivity</b> <b>detector</b> were validated. FDOPA and side products DOPA and FDOPA-quinone were detected and identified in the production batches. The concentrations were 1040, 0. 1 and 61. 5 μg/mL (n = 19), respectively. The samples were measured over a period time of 9 weeks after production and showed a clear increase in the concentration of FDOPA- quinone over time. The DOPA concentration decreasing over this period. In all the samples the concentration of 6 -hydroxy- DOPA was below the detection limit and therefore {{it was not possible to}} identify this side product with UPLC® -MS. The main impurity was FDOPA-quinone, which is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia 7. 0. Conclusions: The quality control of FDOPA using UPLC® -RA was validated for GMP productions.
