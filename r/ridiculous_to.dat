5|$|The music, {{philosophy}} and lifestyle of heavy metal bands and fans were often panned by both left-wing critics and conservative public opinion, described as senseless, <b>ridiculous</b> <b>to</b> {{the limit of}} self-parody, and even dangerous for the young generation. The 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap addressed many idiosyncrasies of British metal bands, showing comic sides of that world which external observers would judge absurd. Instead metal musicians regarded the movie's content as much too real.|$|E
5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing {{any idea that}} the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On the island of Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, he swung the set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing, and that it was <b>ridiculous</b> <b>to</b> think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. No one wanted to know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E

500|$|... "Fionna and Cake" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Adam Muto from a story {{developed}} by Mark Banker, Patrick McHale, Osborne, and series creator Pendleton Ward. The entry {{was directed by}} Larry Leichliter. The genesis for the episode were drawings that character designer and storyboard revisionist Natasha Allegri posted onto the internet during her free time. Her creations were eventually canonized by the show's producers. Allegri even re-rerecorded the show's theme — which had originally been sung by series creator Pendleton Ward — for the episode. Sugar intended [...] "Fionna and Cake" [...] to both be [...] "a jab [...] a huge celebration of, [...] {{the feeling of being}} fan" [...] and [...] "allowing something completely <b>ridiculous</b> <b>to</b> make your heart tighten".|$|E
500|$|With Brosnan, the Bond writers {{knew that}} because of the changes in public attitudes, he could not be as overtly sexual and {{dominant}} over women as Connery's Bond, and was denounced by M in Goldeneye to be a [...] "sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War". Brosnan was seen by many as the quintessential James Bond in appearance and manner; displaying an air of coolness, elegance and a grace which made him believable as an international playboy, if not purely as an assassin. John G. Stackhouse for instance argues that it is preposterous that any man as strikingly handsome as Brosnan and Connery could be a secret agent, saying, [...] "When Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan enters a room, everyone notices. Thus it is <b>ridiculous</b> <b>to</b> suppose that James Bond, looking like that, could be a secret agent for longer than about two seconds".|$|E

500|$|This {{characterisation}} of the Scots {{was often}} politically motivated, {{and many of}} the most hostile writers were based in areas frequently subjected to Scottish raids. English and French accounts of the Battle of the Standard contain many accounts of Scottish atrocities. For instance, Henry of Huntingdon notes that the Scots: [...] "cleft open pregnant women, and took out the unborn babes; they tossed children upon the spear-points, and beheaded priests on altars: they cut the head of crucifixes, and placed them on the trunks of the slain; and placed the heads of the dead upon the crucifixes. Thus wherever the Scots arrived, all was full of horror and full of savagery." [...] A less hostile view was given by Guibert of Nogent in the First Crusade, who encountered Scots and wrote that: [...] "You might have seen a crowd of Scots, a people savage at home but unwarlike elsewhere, descend from their marshy lands, with bare legs, shaggy cloaks, their purse hanging from their shoulders; their copious arms seemed <b>ridiculous</b> <b>to</b> us, but they offered their faith and devotion as aid." ...|$|E
500|$|Never {{afraid to}} speak his mind, in July 1991 in an {{interview}} by The Straits Times Woon commented: [...] "We effectively don't have a Constitution. We have a law {{that can be easily}} changed by Parliament, and by the party in power because the party is Parliament. The changes themselves might not be controversial, but it is unsettling how flexible the Constitution is, unlike, say, in the United States." [...] In reply, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong pointed out that past changes to the Constitution had been made only with a two-thirds parliamentary majority and not done lightheartedly, as the intensive discussions and the two-year gestation period of the Elected President Bill proved. He affirmed that the Constitution had to evolve to reflect the changing needs of the people, and that it could not be assumed that the Constitution, drafted in 1965, would be the best Constitution for always and should be frozen in time. [...] "So to say that because the Government in power changes the Constitution there is no Constitution is <b>ridiculous,</b> <b>to</b> put it mildly." ...|$|E

Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also hit {{on the lack of}} preparation for the upcoming competition and stated that it seemed [...] "like a very bad idea" [...] to be going without a setlist already decided on, much less with songs unwritten. He said the four audition numbers were [...] "awkwardly paced", though he thought they were [...] "fantastic"; Reiter said they [...] "stood out like glinting gems in a somewhat muddy episode". Canning and VanDerWerff also criticized the block of four songs {{in the middle of the}} episode which, as VanDerWerff put it, [...] "stops the show cold". James Poniewozik of Time was unhappy for another reason altogether: [...] "Having four people stand up and sing solos into a microphone may be music; but it ain't a musical." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Strawberry Bubblegum" [...] {{begins with}} the sound of a stylus {{dropping}} on a vinyl record. The line [...] "Hey, pretty lady" [...] is declared by a deep voice, and Timberlake sings [...] "This goes out to you!". ABC News reporter Allan Raible wrote that [...] "such a move seems engineered to make gullible teen girls in the audience scream". The lyrics feature daft double-entendres and are complemented by spoken-word background vocals. MusicOMH's David Meller wrote that the song's transition into [...] "’70s funk-cum-porno keyboards" [...] is likable, but may seem <b>ridiculous</b> <b>to</b> many listeners. The string loops and the record scratches on the song complete [...] "the faux-vintage" [...] vibe of [...] "Strawberry Bubblegum". Raible concluded that it attempts to sound like Michael Jackson's 2002 song [...] "Butterflies" [...] because of its delicate tone. According to Clyde Erwin Barretto of Prefix Mag, [...] "Strawberry Bubblegum" [...] takes its R style in a more avant-garde direction, but its second half is more classic-sounding. Craig Manning of the Western Herald said that the first half of [...] "Strawberry Bubblegum" [...] draws from Frank Ocean's psychedelic style of R, while the outro is more comparable to the music of 'NSYNC, Timberlake's former group. Jason Lipshutz called the outro [...] "sashaying" [...] and [...] "pleasant".|$|E
500|$|Much of Tenebrae {{takes place}} during daytime, or in harshly over-lit interiors. Except for the finale and some night scenes, the entire movie is shot with clear, cold light permeating the surroundings. The {{lighting}} and camerawork used in Andrzej Żuławski's Possession (1981) was {{an influence on}} the film's look. Although tenebr(a)e means [...] "darkness" [...] or [...] "shadows" [...] in Latin, Argento ordered cinematographer Luciano Tovoli to use as much bright light as possible. The director intended that the film be set {{in the near future}} and wanted the lighting to help create a [...] "cold, stark and semi-futuristic look". Argento explained that this approach was also an attempt to imitate what he saw as the [...] "realistic manner of lighting" [...] used in television police shows. The director explained that he was adopting [...] "a modern style of photography, deliberately breaking with the legacy of German Expressionism. Today's light is the light of neon, headlights, and omnipresent flashes... Caring about shadows seemed <b>ridiculous</b> <b>to</b> me and, more than that, reassuring." [...] Argento filmed half-empty streets and shops where he could, in an attempt to reflect a futuristic setting where a disaster had diminished significantly the population of his imaginary city. Tovoli used Kodak 5247 film stock (125 ASA speed rating) for daylight scenes, and Kodak 5293 (250 ASA) for night shoots. Tovoli rated both at 300 ASA to ensure controlled overexposure of the negative during filming, for the benefit of under-developing in the lab and less colour loss. The ultimate aim was for the images to be [...] "crystal clear", and the night scenes to be awash with light.|$|E

500|$|Jean {{has stated}} that he [...] "does not know enough" [...] to say whether he approves of the {{legislation}} of medicinal marijuana, but none of The Simpsons writers use the drug. [...] "It's {{one of the most}} sober writing staffs I've ever encountered", staff writer Max Pross said in the episode's DVD commentary. When asked about what stance the episode holds regarding the legislation of medicinal marijuana, Jean said that series' staff wanted to explore both sides of the issue, rather than making an absolute statement. He added that the episode is rather a critique of legislations that are immediately criminalized after they are legitimized. [...] "The stance is that it seems <b>ridiculous</b> <b>to</b> legalize something and then criminalize it, which I have seen happen in various states", Jean said. He continued, [...] "It's just weird to take away a right or to grant people a liberty and then abandon it. I would say that's the strongest statement [...] makes." [...] The episode also criticizes the use of genetically modified foods. At the beginning of the episode, Marge announces that the family's dinner includes genetically modified vegetables, to which Lisa replies [...] "American corporations should stop playing god with nature." [...] She then notices that her potato starts eating her carrot. Even though the episode portrays genetic modifications in a negative light, none of The Simpsons writers were actually against the technique. After the scene was written, Reiss asked all the writers if they were against genetic modifications of food, and none of them were. [...] "Very often we take these stands on the show that we do not believe in at all", Reiss explained in the DVD commentary for the episode. The scene was originally three times longer, and was conceived during a rewrite session with the staff writers.|$|E
500|$|Reacting to The Killing Joke and Barbara Gordon's later {{character}} development as Oracle in Batman: Gotham Knights, Ray Tate, a reviewer at Comics Bulletin, wrote [...] "here {{is absolutely no}} reason why Barbara Gordon {{should be in a}} wheelchair. Alan Moore and Brian Bolland meant The Killing Joke as an imaginary tale dealing with the iconography of Batman and the Joker... himself is a certifiable genius in biochemistry. There are countless examples of Batman employing that which is only theoretical in his fight against crime. His knowledge of stem cell technology should surpass that of the real world. There is simply no reason for Barbara Gordon to be confined to that wheelchair." [...] Regarding her representation as a character living with a disability, and her effectiveness as a hero compared to her incarnation as Batgirl, Tate asserts [...] "t's <b>ridiculous</b> <b>to</b> think somebody wakes up thinking how lucky they are to be confined to a wheelchair, and yet the attitude around DC and among the fans is that Oracle is the better character over Batgirl because of her handicap. Rubbish. Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle. Batgirl has saved Batman's life on numerous occasions. Oracle has not. Barbara in this incarnation is not a bad character, but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl." [...] In an article for Bitch magazine entitled [...] "The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence", Shannon Cochran noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes. She quotes Gail Simone, who discussed the gender difference regarding the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis: [...] "Both had their backs broken [...] Less than a year later, Batman was fine. Batgirl—now named Oracle—was in a wheelchair and remained so for many years.” ...|$|E
500|$|When the {{character}} was announced, he {{was described as}} a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self. Norwood expanded on this, saying [...] "when he was in school and the register was being read out and it got to his name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create something even more <b>ridiculous</b> <b>to</b> take away from that. He [...] out of himself and took the power away from those that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason most kids put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something that would get away from that and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff is not something that is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world." [...] Before adopting the [...] "Fatboy" [...] persona, he would adopt personas of men he saw on television, and Norwood said Fatboy was [...] "an awkward kind of child". Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom he has a good relationship, but hustles to hide the fact. He often wears clothing brand Ed Hardy, and his speech has, according to Norwood, a [...] "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.|$|E
