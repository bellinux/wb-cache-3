40|$|A novel {{polygeneration}} {{process is}} {{presented in this paper}} that co-produces olefins, methanol, dimethyl ether, and electricity from conventional pipeline natural gas and different kinds of shale gases. Technical analyses of many variants of the process are performed, considering differences in power generation strategy and gas type. The technical analysis results show that the efficiency of the plant varies between 22 %– 57 % (HHV) depending on the product portfolio. The efficiency is higher than a traditional methanol-to-olefin process, which enables it to be competitive with traditional naphtha <b>cracking</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{change of}} {{gasoline}} demand, the changing regulations about {{the reduction of}} environmental impact and the new refining technologies have brought about a modification of gasoline composition. Nowadays, gasoline is a complex mixture of different fractions deriving from processes of <b>reforming,</b> <b>cracking,</b> isomerization and alkylation, {{with the addition of}} both oxygenates compounds and butanes. When the various fractions are mixed, different factors such as octane number, optimization of combustion, environmental restrictions and enterprise economics have to be satisfied. Commercial gasolines must satisfy the specific demands; therefore, it is necessary to analyse the composition of the various fractions to foresee the final composition. Moreover, analysis of the composition of each fraction allows to properly modify the technological process. In this paper some reforming products are analysed by multidimentional gaschromatography. This technique allows a good separation of the different hydrocarbon types to be obtained in a single analysis...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{state-space}} modeling {{issues in the}} context of model-predictive control, with application to catalytic cracking. Emphasis is placed on model establishment, verification and online adjustment. Both the Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and the Residual Catalytic Cracking (RCC) units are discussed. Catalytic cracking units involve complex interactive processes which are difficult to operate and control in an economically optimal way. The strong nonlinearities of the FCC process mean that the control calculation should be based on a nonlinear model with the relevant constraints included. However, the model can be simple compared to the complexity of the catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>plant.</b> Model validity is ensured by a robust online model adjustment strategy. Model-predictive control schemes based on linear convolution models have been successfully applied to the supervisory dynamic control of catalytic cracking units, and the control can be further improved by the SSPC scheme...|$|R
