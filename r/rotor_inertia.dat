As distinct from related studies, here, the angular velocity is calculated from the rotor's equation of motion; thus, the dynamic response of the rotor is taken into account. Results include the following: First, the <b>rotor's</b> <b>inertia</b> filters large amplitude oscillations in the wind torque owing to the first-order dynamics. Second, the generator and wind torques differ especially during wind transients subject to the conservation of angular momentum of the rotor. Third, oscillations of the power coefficient exceed the Betz limit temporarily due to the energy storage in the rotor, which acts as a temporary buffer that stores the kinetic energy like a flywheel in short durations.

The jet model includes the effects of inertia, longitudinal viscosity, and centrifugal and Coriolis forces. For the jet model the specific type of the boundary conditions depends on the balance between the inertia and viscosity in the momentum transfer through the jet cross-section.

40|$|Oil induced instability, is a {{frequently}} encountered phenomenon causing system instability for rotors {{supported by}} hydrodynamic journal-bearings. In this paper a flexible rotor, simply supported {{at one end}} and with oil lubricated journal-bearing at the other, is analytically modelled. The rotor system is modelled in two ways namely as a discrete system by finite element method (FEM) with nonlinear journal-bearing and as a lumped inertia system with linear journal-bearing. The analysed rotor-bearing system is a Bently Nevada Rotor Kit Model RK 4 with Oil whirl/whip option. Results obtained from the simulation of the discrete rotor model with a nonlinear journal-bearing indicate at which rotational speed the oil induced instability (oil whirl) will occur. Campbell diagrams are shown for the lumped <b>inertia</b> <b>rotor</b> model with linear journal-bearing and the critical speeds are predicted. From the results the accuracy of the analytical speed-dependent bearing coefficients are evaluated. These coefficients were derived from the nonlinear bearing impedance descriptions by D. Childs. The bearing impedance descriptions method is a method valid for all L/D (length to diameter) ratios, and all journal eccentricities. The simulation time is significantly reduced by using a lumped <b>inertia</b> <b>rotor</b> model with linear journal-bearing. Critical speed obtained from Campbell diagram predicts a threshold speed of instability which is about 0. 35 % higher than that predicted by the discrete rotor model with a nonlinear journal-bearing.

When the rotor rotating at high speed, power amplifier circuit will be burned down by excessive vibration control current, {{and at the same}} time the excessive control force will be generated. The vibrating force transfers to frame, which causes the system vibration and influence the dynamic properties and safe operation. So unbalance compensation on the rotating machine is necessary, especially for the high speed bearingless motor. Based on introductions of the rotor motion equation of bearingless permanent magnet synchronous motor (BPMSM) and analysis on generation mechanism of unbalance force, feed-forward compensation controller is designed on the technology of adaptive notch filter in this paper. The control system is simulated with Matlab/Simulink toolbox.
