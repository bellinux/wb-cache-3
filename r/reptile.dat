5|$|At Panxian, {{there appears}} to have been a {{transition}} in the endemic marine <b>reptile</b> fauna, possibly caused by volcanism. This volcanism is indicated by the presence of a bentonite layer between the Middle and Upper <b>Reptile</b> Horizons. From lower in the Upper <b>Reptile</b> Horizon, fossils have also been found of the ubiquitous mixosaurian ichthyosaur Mixosaurus panxianensis (which occurs in all layers), the pachypleurosaurs Keichousaurus sp. and Wumengosaurus delicatomandibularis, and fish, although fossils of the latter are fragmentary. The lower Middle and Lower <b>Reptile</b> Horizons also include the mixosaurian Phalarodon cf. fraasi, the primitive ichthyosaur Xinminosaurus catactes, the placodont Placodus inexpectatus, the nothosaurs Lariosaurus hongguoensis and Nothosaurus yangjuanensis, and the archosaur Qianosuchus mixtus, alongside bivalves and saurichthyid fish.|$|E

50|$|All aquatic <b>reptiles</b> breathe {{air into}} lungs. The {{anatomical}} {{structure of the}} lungs is less complex in <b>reptiles</b> than in mammals, with <b>reptiles</b> lacking the very extensive airway tree structure found in mammalian lungs. Gas exchange in <b>reptiles</b> still occurs in alveoli however, <b>reptiles</b> do not possess a diaphragm. Thus, breathing occurs via {{a change in the}} volume of the body cavity which is controlled by contraction of intercostal muscles in all <b>reptiles</b> except turtles. In turtles, contraction of specific pairs of flank muscles governs inspiration or expiration.|$|R

50|$|<b>Reptiles</b> and {{amphibians}} can be omnivores, carnivores, or herbivores. Omnivorous <b>reptiles</b> can be fed species-dependent mixes {{of plant}} or meat-based foods, with additional supplementation, most commonly calcium. Carnivorous <b>reptiles</b> may need living or dried insects or whole rodents. Frozen rodents {{can be bought}} from pet shops and are then thawed before feeding, and live rodents can be kept and sustained before feeding. Some species of <b>reptiles</b> will also feed on smaller <b>reptiles.</b>|$|R
5|$|In contrast, in {{the north}} half of the central and western states, only one, Wyoming, has named a state <b>reptile.</b> In the Great Lakes region, there is a cluster of three states (Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio) that named a <b>reptile.</b> In the Northeast, there is another cluster of three {{participating}} states (Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont).|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{owing to}} the greater {{presence}} of cold-blooded (ectothermic) reptiles in warmer climates, {{the states in the}} southern half of the United States have more commonly designated a state <b>reptile.</b> From the twenty-four of the contiguous states roughly south of the Mason–Dixon line, only five lack a state <b>reptile.</b> From east to west, they are Delaware, Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Utah.|$|E

5|$|The species most {{frequently}} adopted {{as a state}} <b>reptile</b> is the painted turtle, with four states designating it: Colorado (the western subspecies), Illinois, Michigan, and Vermont. Three southern states—Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi—represent themselves with the American alligator. A species of box turtle, Terrapene carolina or common box turtle, has been chosen by three states, with North Carolina and Tennessee using the Terrapene carolina carolina (eastern box turtle) subspecies, and with Missouri using the Terrapene carolina triungus (three-toed box turtle) subspecies. Two bordering western states, California and Nevada, chose the desert tortoise. The loggerhead sea turtle was named by South Carolina as state <b>reptile,</b> while Florida chose it as state saltwater <b>reptile.</b> Florida also named an official tortoise, the gopher tortoise, the same animal as Georgia's state <b>reptile.</b>|$|E

There are over 6700 species of amphibians and over 9000 species of <b>reptiles.</b> In spite of its modern taxonomic irrelevance, the term has persisted, particularly in the names of herpetology, the scientific study of non-avian <b>reptiles</b> and amphibians, and herpetoculture, the captive care and breeding of <b>reptiles</b> and amphibians.|$|R

Recommendations for {{preventing}} transmission of Salmonella from <b>reptiles</b> and amphibians to humans • Pet store owners, health-care practitioners, and veterinarians should provide information to owners and potential purchasers of <b>reptiles</b> and amphibians {{about the risk}} for acquiring salmonellosis from their pets. • Persons should always wash their hands {{with soap and water}} after handling <b>reptiles</b> and amphibians or their cages. • Persons at increased risk for infection with serious complications from salmonellosis (e. g., children aged < 5 years and immunocompromised persons) should avoid contact with <b>reptiles</b> and amphibians. • <b>Reptiles</b> and amphibians should be kept out of households with children aged < 5 years or immunocompromised persons. Families expecting a new child should give away their pet <b>reptiles</b> and amphibians away before the infant arrives. • <b>Reptiles</b> and amphibians should not be kept in child-care centers. • <b>Reptiles</b> and amphibians {{should not be allowed to}} roam freely throughout the house. • <b>Reptiles</b> and amphibians should be kept out of kitchens and other food-preparation areas to prevent contamination. Kitchen sinks should not be used to bathe pets or to wash their dishes, cages, or aquariums. If bathtubs are used for these purposes, they should be thoroughly cleaned afterward...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{recent efforts}} to {{reforest}} cleared rainforest landscapes, in Australia and elsewhere, {{the value of}} reforested sites for rainforest-dependent <b>reptiles</b> is unknown. We surveyed the occurrence of <b>reptiles</b> {{in a range of}} reforestation types (monoculture and mixed species timber plantations, diverse 'ecological restoration' plantings and regrowth), as well as reference sites in pasture and rainforest, in tropical and subtropical Australia. We recorded 29 species of <b>reptiles</b> from 104 sites, including 15 rainforest-dependent species. Most rainforest <b>reptiles</b> were strongly associated with complex microhabitats (tree trunks, logs, rocks). The richness and abundance of rainforest-dependent <b>reptiles</b> varied between the different types of reforestation and between regions. In the tropics, rainforest <b>reptiles</b> were recorded in old timber plantations and ecological restoration plantings, but not in young timber plantations or regrowth. Rainforest <b>reptiles</b> were recorded in few reforested sites in the subtropics. The occurrence of rainforest-dependent <b>reptiles</b> in reforested sites appears to be influenced by (i) habitat structure, (ii) proximity to source populations in rainforest; and (iii) biogeography and historical differences in the extent of rainforest. Restoration of cleared land for rainforest-dependent <b>reptiles</b> may require the development, or deliberate creation, of complex structural attributes and microhabitats in reforested sites. Where reforested sites are located away from rainforest, recolonization by rainforest <b>reptiles</b> may require the construction of corridors of suitable habitat between reforested sites and rainforest or the translocation of <b>reptiles</b> to reforested sites.

5|$|<b>Reptile</b> later {{appears in}} the 1995 film Mortal Kombat as a bipedal lizard, camouflaging himself until found by Liu Kang. After being thrown into a statue, <b>Reptile</b> {{transforms}} into a human-looking ninja and battles Liu Kang, but is defeated and then crushed after reverting to his original form. Reptile's lizard form was rendered {{with the use of}} computer-generated imagery, while the character's human form is portrayed by Keith Cooke, clothed similar to Scorpion and Sub-Zero in the film, but green and with a fanged open mouth imprinted on his face mask. Originally not included in the movie, <b>Reptile</b> was added in response to focus groups being unimpressed with the original fights in the film. Actor Robin Shou (Liu Kang) and director Paul Anderson noted that neither knew what Reptile's lizard form would look like until after filming, making the pre-fight sequence difficult to shoot.|$|E
