This review focuses on recent findings about various aspects of motors, including chirality, stoichiometry, channel size, entropy, conformational change, and energy usage rate, {{in a variety of}} well-studied motors, including F o F 1 ATPase, helicases, viral dsDNA-packaging motors, bacterial chromosome translocases, myosin, kinesin, and dynein. In particular, dsDNA translocases are used to illustrate how these features relate to the motion mechanism and how nature elegantly evolved a revolution mechanism to avoid coiling and tangling during lengthy dsDNA genome transportation in cell division. Motor chirality and channel size are two factors that distinguish <b>rotation</b> <b>motors</b> from revolution <b>motors.</b> <b>Rotation</b> <b>motors</b> use right-handed channels to drive the right-handed dsDNA, similar to the way a nut drives the bolt with threads in same orientation; revolution motors use left-handed motor channels to revolve the right-handed dsDNA. <b>Rotation</b> <b>motors</b> use small channels (3 nm) with room for the bolt to revolve. Binding and hydrolysis of ATP are linked to different conformational entropy changes in the motor that lead to altered affinity for the substrate and allow work to be done, for example, helicase unwinding of DNA or translocase directional movement of DNA...|$|R

This was done first at low field strengths, then at field strengths generating speeds high enough to disrupt motor function, and finally at low field strengths. Comparison of the initial and final speed versus applied-torque plots yielded relative motor torque. For backward <b>rotation,</b> <b>motor</b> torque rose steeply at speeds close to zero, peaking, on average, at about 2. 2 times the stall torque. For forward <b>rotation,</b> <b>motor</b> torque remained approximately constant up to speeds of about 60 % of the zero-torque speed. Then the torque dropped linearly with speed, crossed zero, and reached a minimum, on average, at about - 1. 7 times the stall torque. The zero-torque speed increased with temperature (about 90 Hz at 11 degrees C, 140 Hz at 16 degrees C, and 290 Hz at 23 degrees C), while other parameters remained approximately constant. Sometimes the motor slipped at either extreme (delivered constant torque over a range of speeds), but eventually it broke. Similar results were obtained whether motors broke catastrophically (suddenly and completely) or progressively or were de-energized by brief treatment with an uncoupler.

For example, rotation may be guided by processes that also prime one to see results of a specific motor action. We directly test the hypothesis by means of a dual-task paradigm in which subjects perform the Cooper-Shepard mental rotation task while executing an unseen <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> in a given direction and at a previously learned speed. Four results support the inference that mental <b>rotation</b> relies on <b>motor</b> processes. First, <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> that is compatible with mental rotation results in faster times and fewer errors in the imagery task than when the two rotations are incompatible. Second, the angle through which subjects rotate their mental images, and the angle through which they rotate a joystick handle are correlated, but only if the directions of the two rotations are compatible. Third, <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> modifies the classical inverted V-shaped mental rotation response time function, favoring the direction of the motor rotation; indeed, in some cases <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> even shifts the location of the minimum of this curve {{in the direction of the}} <b>motor</b> <b>rotation.</b> Fourth, the preceding effect is sensitive not only to the direction of the <b>motor</b> <b>rotation,</b> but also to the motor speed.

But as described in some reports, the use of liposomes was limited by poor repeatability and low encapsulation efficiency and enzyme inactivity, while magnetic NPs was limited by sizes and complicated controllability [28 – 30]. In this work, we used F 0 F 1 -ATPase as a mechanical <b>rotation</b> <b>motor.</b> We separated all the subunits from it first, then reassembled and optimized, and obtained a new relatively complicated nanomachine at last. Under the condition of light driving, the new nanomachine can produce proton gradient, which provides energy for the nanomachine, and makes it rotate smoothly and easily without the limitation of the δ-subunit. Although the assembled process of the δ-subunit-free F 0 F 1 -ATPase is relatively complicated, it has good repeatability, stability, and activity according to our previous studies [14, 15, 22]. However, the proton gradient formed by the light driving may be not the only selection. Li et al. entrapped glucose oxidases (GODs) into the cavity of polymeric hollow spheres of biomimetic nanocapsules, which can hydrolyze glucose in the suspension and produce proton gradient, thus supply power for ATPase.

Method: Serial, retrospective study with measures of the noise intensities in dBNA with a decibelimeter Minipa MSL- 1352 C, USA, in four dental clinics of the public service and four private clinics in Jundiaí-SP, initially from the basal environment noise in each clinic, during five minutes and then from the noise emitted by the high <b>rotation</b> <b>motor</b> (mar) in operation during five minutes to obtain the averages. Results:Public clinics: 1) basal medium= 56. 4 dB;mar= 77. 2 dB. 2) basal medium= 61. 7 dB;mar= 73. 7 dB. 3) basal medium= 61. 07 dB;mar= 75. 04 dB. 4) basal medium= 63. 6 dB;mar= 77. 3 dB.

30|$|Radiologists have {{developed}} a full five-step ultrasonographic shoulder protocol that includes evaluation of the following structures: the long head of the biceps brachii tendon, the subscapularis tendon, the supraspinatus tendon and rotator interval with both static and dynamic evaluation for subacromial impingement, the acromioclavicular joint, and the infraspinatus and teres minor tendons with the posterior glenoid labrum [10]. The performed ultrasonography is 79 % sensitive and 88 % specific for diagnosing supraspinatus tendon calcification and impingement syndrome using dynamic maneuvers such as humerus abduction [11]. One of the key pitfalls for all musculoskeletal ultrasound examinations is anisotropy artifact that requires perpendicular insonation of tendons, ligaments, muscle, and nerves to observe the correct echotexture of the structures [10]. Another pitfall is the improper positioning of the shoulder in visualizing the supraspinatus tendon. Radiologists have also developed specific sonographic signs of shoulder subacromial impingement such as pooling of fluid laterally to the subdeltoid portion of the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa while the humerus is abducted [5]. Our patient had excellent internal and external <b>rotation</b> <b>motor</b> strength of her shoulder, and she stated no tenderness over her long head of the biceps tendon. A focused point-of-care emergency department bedside ultrasound examination was performed over her supraspinatus tendon, and this revealed calcification near the attachment to the greater tuberosity of the humerus; a dynamic bedside ultrasound long-axis evaluation of the patient's supraspinatus tendon showed elevation of the greater tuberosity cranially {{to the level of}} the acromion and impingement of the supraspinatus tendon underneath the acromion of the scapula when the patient actively abducted her left humerus. A complete evaluation of our patient's supraspinatus tendon was obstructed by the calcifications in her supraspinatus tendon, and which may have hidden a partial rotator cuff tear.|$|E
40|$|During assembly, {{bacterial}} virus phi 29 utilizes a motor to insert genomic DNA into a preformed protein shell called the procapsid. The motor contains one twelve-subunit connector with a 3. 6 nm central channel for DNA transportation, six viral-encoded RNA (packaging RNA or pRNA) and a protein, gp 16, with unknown stoichiometry. Recent DNA-packaging models {{proposed that the}} 5 -fold procapsid vertexes and 12 -fold connector (or the hexameric pRNA ring) represented a symmetry mismatch enabling production of a force to drive a <b>rotation</b> <b>motor</b> to translocate and compress DNA. There was a discrepancy regarding {{the location of the}} foothold for the pRNA. One model [C. Chen and P. Guo (1997) J. Virol., 71, 3864 – 3871] suggested that the foothold for pRNA was the connector and that the pRNA–connector complex was part of the rotor. However, one other model suggested that the foothold for pRNA was the 5 -fold vertex of the capsid protein and that pRNA was the stator. To elucidate the mechanism of phi 29 DNA packaging, it is critical to confirm whether pRNA binds to the 5 -fold vertex of the capsid protein or to the 12 -fold symmetrical connector. Here, we used both purified connector and purified procapsid for binding studies with in vitro transcribed pRNA. Specific binding of pRNA to the connector in the procapsid was found by photoaffinity crosslinking. Removal of the N-terminal 14 amino acids of the gp 10 protein by proteolytic cleavage resulted in undetectable binding of pRNA to either the connector or the procapsid, as investigated by agarose gel electrophoresis, SDS–PAGE, sucrose gradient sedimentation and N-terminal peptide sequencing. It is therefore concluded that pRNA bound to the 12 -fold symmetrical connector to form a pRNA–connector complex and that the foothold for pRNA is the connector but not the capsid protein...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have found}} that {{children}} with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have a rigidity of motor plans and difficulties planning and executing movements (Eigsti et al., 2013). Children with ASD also exhibit repetitive behaviors such as nail biting and rocking back and forth. When planning for movements, repetitive behaviors might manifest as difficulty in formulating new or switching between different motor plans. In typically developing individuals, sequential actions often exhibit hysteresis, which is a phenomenon that explains that the way an individual chooses a specific motor plan could be influenced by recent, similar motor actions. We sought to determine if hysteresis was stronger in children with ASD and if this was influencing the planning and execution of a motor task. A <b>rotation</b> <b>motor</b> task was created to evaluate the rigidity of motor planning capabilities and hysteresis of five children with ASD (7 - 9 years old). A control group, consisting of 5 age-matched participants was also tested. The participant sat across from the researcher. A stick was placed in different orientations around a circle grid system containing 24 positions. The researcher would move the stick counterclockwise or clockwise in these positions, reveal the position to the participant, {{and ask them to}} return it to the home position. Researchers measured the position at which the child switched from a thumb up to a thumb down grasp in both the clockwise and counterclockwise direction. While moving the stick clockwise, the peak switch (the switch where children adopted a comfortable grasp) occurred much later for children with ASD. These children also switched their grasp positions less frequently than the control group. The {{results of this study suggest}} that changing a grasp was more costly than being comfortable while performing the action, and that hysteresis was more prevalent in children with ASD than in the control group...|$|E

Details of Design, Modeling, Characterization, Realization and Control of Poly Phase SMA Motor are presented. Motor with 3 and 6 Phases, with {{appropriate}} Control circuit have been realized in laboratory and simulated results have been verified experimentally. In literature, broadly two types of Shape Memory Alloy based motors namely limited <b>rotation</b> <b>motor</b> and unlimited <b>rotation</b> <b>motor</b> are found. In the unlimited rotation type SMA based motor the SMA element is in the spring form. Hence, an attempt {{has been made in}} this research to develop an Unlimited Rotating type Balanced Poly Phase Motor based on SMA wire in series with a spring in each phase. By isolating SMA actuation and spring action a constant force by the SMA wire through out its range of operation is achieved. While designing the motor, similarity in function between Poly Phase SMA Motor and Stepper Motor was found. Hence, the Poly Phase Motor is characterized similar to that of a Stepper Motor. Functionally, the Poly Phase Motor can be used in stepping mode for generating incremental motion and servo mode for generating continuous motion. Various parameters of the motor have been defined. The motor can be actuated in either direction with different Phase sequencing methods, which are presented in this work. While explaining sequencing methods, effect of the thermal time constants has also been presented. The lumped thermal model is used for dynamic simulation of motor. The motor has been modeled with a new approach to the SMA wire Hysteresis model. This model is simple and useful for real time control applications. Model is implemented using Simulink and used for the simulation of the motor. Generalization of the motor concept is done and motor up to 16 Phases are studied and the simulation results done using MATLAB are discussed. It could be observed that the torque generated by the motor increases with increased number of phases while the torque ripple reduces. The motor torque ripple is better for motor with odd number of phases due to its construction. Two methods of achieving servo motion are presented. The first method is Micro Stepping, consisting of controlling single phase temperature with a position feedback. The second method is Antagonistic Control of temperatures of phases with position feedback. Both the above methods use PID Controller with optical encoder feedback for position sensing. Performance of the actuator with step, ramp and triangle inputs has been simulated using Simulink and verified experimentally for various loads and disturbances. Positional accuracy of 0. 07 % for the Step input and for the full rotation of 3600 is achieved. Vector Control of SMA Motor is presented. By this method Speed and the torque of the motor will be effectively controlled. Since the temperatures of the wires are controlled in this research, this method is named as Thermal Space Phasor or Vector Based Control. This method of rotation of motor is simulated using Simulink and verified experimentally. Here the current through the SMA is controlled so as to get near sinusoidal variation in temperature. This leads to a near Sinusoidal variation of force. It is shown that by controlling the temperature of phases Sinusoidally with a phase shift of 1200, the Resultant Force will be a constant over the Spatial angle of 3600 and its Velocity of rotation will be Constant. Open loop and closed loop control of the speed and torque is presented. While the motor rotates at fixed Speed and Torque in Open Loop Control, motor adopts to change in torque and velocity in Closed Loop control with reduced ripple. PID Controller is used for closed loop control. The presented rotary actuator and their experimental results set a new standard for SMA based new generation rotary actuators and control...|$|E

Hence, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate the thermal performance and enhance the cooling capacity of the belt-driven type Integrated Starter Generator. In this study, the internal temperature variations of the motor were investigated with respect to the operating parameters, particularly the rotation speed and environment temperature. At a maximum ambient temperature of 105 °C and <b>rotation</b> speed (<b>motor</b> design point) of 4500 rpm, the coil of the motor was heated to approximately 189 °C in generating mode. The harsh conditions of the starting mode were analyzed by assuming that the motor operates during the start-up time at a maximum ambient temperature of 105 °C and <b>rotation</b> speed (<b>motor</b> design point) of 800 rpm; the coil was heated to approximately 200 °C, which is close to the insulation temperature limit. The model for analyzing the thermal performance of the ISG was verified by comparing its results with those obtained through a generating-mode-based experimen...|$|R
