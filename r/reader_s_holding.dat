40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study is to describe and present consumer complaint responses through the <b>Reader</b> <b>s</b> Letter column in Kompas. com. In collecting the data, the researcher uses secondary data from documentation of complaints taken from the online version of <b>Reader</b> <b>s</b> Letters of Kompas daily newspaper ([URL] or Kompas. com). A total of 168 complaint letters were analyzed during the period December 2011 to April 2012. Results showed that 85 % contain negative words toward the companies (disappointed, frustrated, failed to satisfy customer, feeling trapped and robbed, etc) as reasons to complain through the <b>Reader</b> <b>s</b> Letter column of Kompas. com. Based on this study, companies in Indonesia seem not to place importance on responding to consumer complaints as less than 2 % of companies were eager to reply to the complaints in the same column of <b>Reader</b> <b>s</b> Letter, and only 6 % of complaints were resolved based on the sample data. This paper aims to identify and suggest practical company solutions directly applicable to service management...|$|R

According to these rules a leakage cancellation module is designed and implemented. In combination with an RFID reader prototype, based on the Impinj Indy IC, the fabricated leakage cancellation module is evaluated in an anechoic chamber. The influence of leakage and leakage cancellation on the <b>reader</b> <b>s</b> read rate and read range in mono- and bi-static mode is examined. With regard to the evaluation results, guidelines are stated, in which cases a leakage cancellation module is recommended and in which cases it may even degrade the <b>reader</b> <b>s</b> performance...|$|R

Bibliotherapy, using books to promote healing, is {{a special kind of}} <b>reader</b> <b>s</b> advisory. This article traces the origins of these two concepts and examines their underlying assumptions. It addresses the process through which stories may aid in healing and the process librarians should follow if they decide to engage in bibliotherapy. It concludes that librarians must know the difference between advising and counseling on both a professional and personal level and that they should be wary of letting the power inherent in the readers advisory role endanger their professionalism...|$|R
40|$|The {{epilogue}} of Toni Morrison s A Mercy (2008) is {{narrated by}} the teenage character-narrator Florens mother. Though addressed to her daughter, the mother s words are heard/read {{only by the}} reader, who is left with the (merciful?) gift of understanding and reinterpreting the very act {{that is at the}} center of the novel. The picture (s) he shapes, the telling (s) he hears (161), are conditioned by Florens narration the affective lens through which the world (161) and the narrative are to be read. The <b>reader</b> <b>s</b> legitimacy is recognized and rewarded at the very end of A Mer-cy. Indeed, the mother s account, conjured up by Florens, is staged as an imaginary reconciliation, arising from the reading itself, as well as from the <b>reader</b> <b>s</b> affective, aesthetic desire for such reconciliation...|$|R

40|$|Despite the Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{efforts in}} Rothgery {{to shore up}} a 2 ̆ 2 bright-line rule 2 ̆ 2 for {{attachment}} based upon prior case law, {{the contours of the}} Sixth Amendment right to counsel are still somewhat obscure. To understand the impact of the Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>holding,</b> each state will need to assess its criminal procedure and identify how to reconcile the Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>holding</b> with current practices. This Comment identifies two areas of North Carolina criminal procedure that have been impacted by the Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>holding</b> in Rothgery: (1) the expanded scope of a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s protection under the Sixth Amendment during police questioning under Rothgery; and (2) Rothgery 2 ̆ 7 s impact on attachment of the right to counsel in light of the arresting officer 2 ̆ 7 s discretion to cite the arrestee rather than perform a full custodial arrest. This Comment will discuss: the disconnect between the rule enunciated in Rothgery and current North Carolina criminal procedure; the impact of Rothgery on current practices, specifically police interrogation of defendants without the presence of counsel and the practice of misdemeanor citation and custodial arrest; and finally, recommendations for streamlining North Carolina criminal procedure to comply with the Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>holding</b> in Rothgery...|$|R

40|$|With this thesis, I wish {{to grant}} {{critical}} space to a character often overlooked in Shakespeare studies. Antony and Cleopatra {{has long been}} considered one of Shakespeare s most difficult problem tragedies. In a play where the notion of moral superiority is as elusive as its protagonists, the character that best engages the reader and informs his/her perception of the play is not a queen or an emperor, but a simple soldier only. Enobarbus is a character who straddles not only the Alexandrian and Roman worlds, but also the realm between play and audience, text and reader. An understanding of him is essential to a thorough critical consideration of Antony and Cleopatra. This thesis aims to map his significance by delving deeply into {{the text of the}} play, attempting to determine Enobarbus effect on the <b>reader</b> <b>s</b> experience of the characters, the themes, the tragedy, as well as how the <b>reader</b> <b>s</b> perception of him can and will alter these experiences. I will also compare and contrast Enobarbus role with that of similar characters in Shakespeare s body of writing. Additionally, I seek to discover how varying filmic portrayals of his character can alter the <b>reader</b> s/viewer <b>s</b> perception of the play as a whole...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} two terminating tableau {{systems for}} hybrid logic with the difference modality. Both systems {{are based on}} an abstract treatment of equality. They expand formulas {{with respect to a}} congruence closure that is not represented explicitly. The first system employs pattern-based blocking. The second system employs chain-based blocking and covers converse modalities. Both systems can handle transitive relations. 1 Introduction There are two established ways to arrive at modal logic with equality [5, 10, 1]. One approach employs the difference modality D, defined such that a property Ds holds for a state x if there exists a different state y such that <b>s</b> <b>holds</b> for y. The other approach, known as hybrid logic, employs nominals, which are primitive properties holding for exactly one state x. Without further extensions, the difference modality is more powerful than nominals. Once nominals are accompanied by the global modality E (Es holds for x if there exists a y for which <b>s</b> <b>holds),</b> both approaches have the same expressivity [13]...|$|R
