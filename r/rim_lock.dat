2500|$|There {{are various}} types of {{off-road}} motorcycles, also known as dirt bikes, specially designed for off-road events. The term off-road refers to driving surfaces that are not conventionally paved. These are rough surfaces, often created naturally, such as sand, gravel, a river, mud or snow. These types of terrain can sometimes only be travelled on with vehicles designed for off-road driving (such as SUVs, ATVs, snowmobiles and mountain bikes) or vehicles that have off-road equipment. Compared to road-going motorcycles, off-road machines are simpler and lighter, having long suspension travel, high ground clearance, and rugged construction with little bodywork and no fairings for less damage in spills. [...] Wheels (usually 21" [...] front, 18" [...] rear) have knobby tires, often clamped to the rim with a <b>rim</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>rim</b> <b>lock</b> is a {{locking device}} that {{attaches}} {{to the surface of}} a door.|$|E
50|$|Mortise locks {{may include}} a {{non-locking}} sprung latch {{operated by a}} door handle. Such a lock is termed a sash lock. A simpler form without a handle or latch is termed a 'dead lock'. Dead locks are commonly used as a secure backup to a sprung non-deadlocking latch, usually a pin tumbler <b>rim</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} doors {{have been}} replaced with VJ plank doors, some half- height. Several have <b>rim</b> <b>locks</b> evident. The original timber door lintels are present but severely damaged by termites. The windows are voids with traces of the original joinery evident.|$|R
50|$|The Officer's tool (or A tool) is forcible entry tool used by firefighters. It {{consists}} of a rounded steel handle approximately 18 inches long, with one end tapering to a flattened tip for prying or punching and the other terminated with a perpendicular steel head. the head is four inches long and has a steel forked end opposite a striking end. The Officer's tool, like the smaller K-tool is used to remove the lock cylinders, such as used on <b>rim</b> <b>locks,</b> police locks, dead-bolts, or key-in-the-knob locks.|$|R
50|$|A {{handful of}} {{companies}} offered four-wheel-drive conversions, such as County Tractors of Knighton in Powys, who converted vans {{on behalf of}} Ford as a Special Vehicle Operations factory option. The first Transit County models {{were based on the}} Mk2 Transit model, both long and short wheelbase. The conversion used a Dana 44F front axle and a NP208 transfer box, both lifted from the Ford Bronco, coupled to the regular Transit engine, gearbox and rear axle using three custom propshafts. The Transit rear axle was retained, mounted to a rear subframe or 'lift cradle' to give the extra ride height. Other modifications were 16-inch wheel <b>rims,</b> <b>locking</b> front hubs, a heavy-duty steering box and 305 mm diameter front brake discs.|$|R
50|$|For {{motorcycle}} tires, {{a device}} {{similar to the}} internal beadlock of 4-wheel drive vehicles can be used. A special inner tube is inflated via its own valve stem to high pressure to push the bead of the tire tight against the wheel. Like the <b>rim</b> <b>lock,</b> this clamps both beads at once. The regular valve stem is used to inflate the tire to the desired pressure.|$|E

5000|$|Motorcycle tires use a {{different}} style of beadlock, {{also known as a}} <b>rim</b> <b>lock</b> or bead stopper. Motorcycle tire rim locks clamp both beads at once because the tire is narrow enough do this conveniently with one device, and also {{there is no such thing}} as an [...] "inside bead" [...] and [...] "outside bead" [...] on a motorcycle tire. A curved metal plate inside the tire presses both beads outward against the inside of the wheel rim to clamp both beads at once in one localized area. A threaded stem attached to the plate is placed through a hole in the [...] "well" [...] of the rim, with the plate inside the tire and the threaded stem on the outside. The <b>rim</b> <b>lock</b> is tightened using either a standard bolt that leaves the threads visible, or a special bolt that covers the threads. The threaded stem or special bolt is visible on the inner surface of the wheel and points towards the axle, just like the valve stem.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Anatomic volar <b>rim</b> <b>locking</b> {{plates are}} {{designed}} {{with the aim of}} treating intraarticular distal radius fractures. When used to treat comminuted distal radius fractures, these plates can damage the flexor tendons. In this study, we sought to determine the radiological and functional results and rate of complications of these plates. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 36 patients (28 males, 8 females; mean age: 46. 4 years) with AO/OTA Type C 2 -C 3 distal radius fractures treated with anatomic volar rim distal radius plates between January 2011 and December 2014. Radial length, radial inclination and palmar tilt were compared with the intact wrist. Results were evaluated with the Mayo wrist and Lidstrom scores. Complications were documented throughout the follow-up period of 23. 8 (range: 12 to 48) months. Results: Postoperative measurements of the radial length, inclination and palmar tilt did not differ significantly. Mayo wrist and Lidstrom scores were good and excellent in 27 and 32 patients, respectively. Flexor tenosynovitis was symptomatic in 15 patients and asymptomatic (localized swelling only) in 21. Plates were removed from 15 patients due to symptomatic tenosynovitis and from six patients due to partial rupture of the flexor pollicis longus tendon. The flexor digitorum profundus tendon of the second finger was also partially ruptured in three patients. Conclusion: Anatomic volar <b>rim</b> <b>locking</b> plates provide satisfying radiological and functional results in treating AO/OTA Type C 2 -C 3 comminuted distal radius fractures. However, if these plates interfere with the union of the fracture, they should be removed to avoid potential tendon problems caused by their placement in the rim region.

50|$|To make a <b>rim</b> brake <b>lock</b> {{the wheel}} as firmly as {{possible}} {{a number of}} techniques are used. The most common is where the braking surface of the rim is roughened using an angle grinder. This creates what trials riders refer to as a ground rim. Rim grinds can vary from quite light where the rim surface is very slightly roughened, {{all the way to}} a 'harsh' grind, where the rim has deep grooves (Heading for 1 mm deep if very harsh) in it. A grind may be referred to as 'dead' if it has been used a lot and the brake pads have started to polish it back smooth. Depending on the weather conditions and the brake pad compound chosen, different levels of grind are required for peak brake performance. Ground <b>rims</b> give consistent <b>lock</b> and hold in all but the muddiest conditions, making them more popular in wetter climates than smooth rims.|$|R
25|$|The {{acetabular}} cup is {{the component}} which is placed into the acetabulum (hip socket). Cartilage and bone {{are removed from}} the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either UHMWPE (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is {{held in place by}} a metal coating {{on the outside of the}} cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are sintered beads and a foam metal design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force. Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a <b>rim</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a Morse taper.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} styles of beadlocks. For 4-wheel drive vehicles, a ring {{with a number}} of bolts around the {{circumference}} is used to clamp the tire to the wheel. For motorcycles, a <b>rim</b> <b>lock</b> or bead stopper is a curved plate tightened by a single bolt. For both 4-wheel drive vehicles and motorcycles, a different style of beadlock can be used that is similar to an inner tube which is inflated to press the tire against the wheel.|$|E

5000|$|Each Mason & Hamlin piano {{includes}} a Tension Resonator, {{which is a}} system of steel rods under moderate tension, anchored to the wooden structure {{on the opposite side}} of the sounding board from the strings and iron frame. In grand pianos these rods fan out from one or two central hubs and are attached at intervals around the rim and to the belly rail; the model 50 upright has a rod stretched between the case sides. The manufacturer claims that this adds strength and rigidity to the <b>rim</b> by <b>locking</b> the <b>rim</b> into its permanent shape and which in turn preserves the [...] "crown" [...] of the soundboard.|$|R

50|$|A plastic cord lock (also {{known as}} cord fastener, plastic stopper or cord toggle) {{attaches}} to drawstrings and tightens {{without the use}} of knots. Cord locks allow mountaineers to fasten clothing and camping equipment quickly in cold conditions when the fingers are encased in heavy gloves. They consist generally of three parts: a barrel, a toggle (plunger), and a spring. Squeezed together, tension is released and the cord lock can move freely up and down the cords. Released, the tension is engaged and the cord lock stays in place. They come in many sizes and shapes to suit to any purpose, including plastic cord lock, mini size cord lock, no spring cord lock, with spring cord <b>lock,</b> with <b>rim</b> cord <b>lock.</b>|$|R
25|$|ULDs {{come in two}} forms: pallets and containers. ULD pallets are rugged {{sheets of}} {{aluminum}} with <b>rims</b> designed to <b>lock</b> onto cargo net lugs. ULD containers, also known as cans and pods, are closed containers made of aluminum or combination of aluminum (frame) and Lexan (walls), which, depending {{on the nature of}} the goods to be transported, may have built-in refrigeration units. Examples of common ULDs and their specifics are listed below.|$|R
50|$|One of Naamani's {{most famous}} works is <b>Rim</b> of the <b>Lock</b> in which Naamani explores {{individuality}} of the Lebanese society {{based on the}} Lebanese Civil War. She writes of the pain, violence, and atrocities that occurred during this chaotic time, while suggesting that there are tangible solutions to reach tranquility in the country. It is in poetic form and attempts to employ pathetic appeal as well as spiritual allusions to assert her vision of sadness, but also her hope for the future.|$|R
25|$|Calixarenes are characterised by a {{three-dimensional}} basket, cup or bucket shape. In calixarenes the internal volume is around 10 cubic angstroms. Calixarenes are characterised {{by a wide}} upper rim and a narrow lower rim and a central annulus. With phenol as a starting material the 4 hydroxyl groups are intrannular on the lower rim. In a resorcinarene 8 hydroxyl groups are placed extraannular on the upper ring. Calixarenes exist in different chemical conformations because rotation around the methylene bridge is not difficult. In calixarene 4 up-down conformations exist: cone (point group C2v,C4v), partial cone Cs, 1,2 alternate C2h and 1,3 alternate D2d. The 4 hydroxyl groups interact by hydrogen bonding and stabilize the cone conformation. This conformation is in dynamic equilibrium with the other conformations. Conformations can be locked in place with proper substituents replacing the hydroxyl groups which increase the rotational barrier. Alternatively placing a bulky substituent on the upper <b>rim</b> also <b>locks</b> a conformation. The calixarene based on p-tert-butyl phenol is also a cone. Calixarenes are structurally related to the pillararenes.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} aspects of wheel {{geometry}} {{which must be}} brought into adjustment in order to true a wheel. [...] "Lateral truing" [...] refers to elimination of local deviations of the rim {{to the left or}} right of center. [...] "Vertical truing" [...] refers to adjustments of local deviations (known as hop) of the radius, the distance from the rim {{to the center of the}} hub. [...] "Dish" [...] refers to the left-right centering of the plane of the <b>rim</b> between the <b>lock</b> nuts on the outside ends of the axle. This plane is itself determined as an average of local deviations in the lateral truing. For most rim-brake bicycles, the dish will be symmetrical on the front wheel. However, on the rear wheel, because most bicycles accommodate a rear sprocket (or group of them), the dishing will often be asymmetrical: it will be dished at a deeper angle on the non-drive side than on the drive side.|$|R
50|$|From 2nd to 4th gear, in {{contrast}} to the 1st gear, power transmission in 2nd to 4th gear occurs purely mechanically. The transition from 1st gear into 2nd gear occurs automatically, independent on the driving speed and the driving peddle position. The hydrodynamic power transmission is switched off in 2nd gear. This occurs by the pump brake being closed, which stops the impeller. At the same time, the turbine wheel is not transmitting torque to the turbine gear due to the open turbine brake. The transmission ratio of the 2nd gear corresponds to the input differential.When changing from 2nd into 3rd gear, the input clutch opens and the lockup clutch, is shut. As a result, the drive shaft is, by the outer <b>rim</b> of the <b>locked</b> up clutch, directly connected with the planetary gear shaft, and thus the output shaft. The ratio is now 1:1.Depending on the position of the accelerator pedal, the vehicle load and the topography, the shift from 3rd to 4th gear occurs automatically. During this transition, the locked up clutch opens while the coupling for the 4th gear, the fast release coupling, closes.The 4th gear represents the overdrive gear, with the ratio of 0.7 or 0.73 depending on the differential.|$|R
