5|$|Florida State {{kicked off}} {{following}} the score, and Tech's offense began work from its 18-yard line. Though quarterback Taylor was sacked {{on the first}} play of the drive, the Hokies recovered the lost yardage and gained a first down with the final play of the quarter.

5|$|Following Tennessee's score, the {{two teams}} traded {{possessions}} as each offense went three-and-out. Virginia Tech's offense then began a drive from its 40-yard line with 3:21 <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> half. Williams gained a first down {{with a pair of}} five-yard running plays, and Taylor gained 21 yards on another running play. Tech advanced to the Tennessee 31-yard line, where Taylor was sacked for a loss of nine yards. In an effort to recover the lost field position, Taylor threw a pass downfield, but the ball was intercepted by Tennessee's Janzen Jackson, who returned it to the Tech 48-yard line. Tennessee's offense entered the field of play with 1:11 <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarter, and it moved quickly. On the first play of the drive, a Crompton pass was caught by Hardesty for a 47-yard gain. Two plays later, Crompton completed a two-yard toss to Moore for a touchdown. The extra point tied the game at 14 with 18 seconds remaining before halftime.|$|E
5|$|Following the score, kickoff, and return, Tech began another {{offensive}} possession at its 24-yard line. The Hokies {{picked up}} two first downs and drove into NC State territory, but the clock continued to tick toward halftime. In the Wolfpack {{side of the}} field, Tech running back Eddie Hunter broke free for a 23-yard run, the longest play by Virginia Tech in the second quarter. There was now just over twominutes <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarter. Tech was unable to pick up another first down after Hunter's run, and attempted to convert the fourth down rather than trying a field goal. When the play was stopped for a loss, however, Virginia Tech was denied points and NC State's offense returned with 47seconds <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> half.|$|E

5|$|Georgia's punt {{rolled into}} the end zone for a touchback, and with 1:28 <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, Virginia Tech began the final drive on its own 20-yard line.

Glennon's attempt at a Hail Mary pass fell short, giving Georgia the win with a final score of 31–24.|$|E
5|$|Having stopped Kansas on fourth down, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense at its 22-yard line. With just 5:51 <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, the Hokies badly needed to score quickly {{and get a}} {{defensive}} stop {{in order to have}} a chance to win. The Hokies advanced on the first aspect of that requirement as Sean Glennon converted several first downs through the air. Kansas allowed no play over nineyards until late in the drive, forcing Virginia Tech to use up valuable time. On the last play of the drive, Sean Glennon connected on a 20-yard strike to Justin Harper for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points, but with just three minutes <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, Virginia Tech's comeback would only be complete if the Hokies could recover a difficult onside kick.|$|E
