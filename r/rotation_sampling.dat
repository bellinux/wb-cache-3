The distribution transfer has many applications in remote sensing and image processing such as color adjustment for image mosaicing, image classification, and change detection. The sampling begins with generating a set of random orthogonal matrix samples by Householder transformation technique. The advantage of using the Householder transformation for generating the set of orthogonal matrices is the uniform distribution of the orthogonal matrix samples. The obtained orthogonal matrices are then converted to proper rotation matrices. The performance of using the proposed <b>rotation</b> matrix <b>sampling</b> scheme was tested against the uniform <b>rotation</b> angle <b>sampling.</b> The applications of the proposed method were also demonstrated using two applications i. e., image to image probability distribution transfer and data Gaussianization...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} the survey estimation {{of a population}} mean in continuous time. For this purpose we extend the <b>rotation</b> <b>sampling</b> method to functional data. In contrast to conventional rotation designs that select the sample before the survey, our approach randomizes each sample replacement and thus al-lows for adaptive sampling. Using Markov chain theory, we evaluate the covariance structure and the integrated squared error [ISE] of the related Horvitz-Thompson estimator. Our sampling designs decrease the mean ISE by suitably reallocating the sample across population strata during replacements. They also reduce the variance of the ISE by increasing the frequency or the intensity of replacements. To investigate the benefits of using both current and past measurements in the estimation, we develop a new composite estimator. In an application to electricity usage data, our rotation method outperforms fixed panels and conventional rota-tion samples. Because of the weak temporal dependence of the data, the composite estimator only slightly improves upon the Horvitz-Thompson estimator...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimation}} of finite population mean {{on the current}} occasion based on the samples selected over two occasions has been considered.

The bias and mean square error of the proposed estimator is obtained. We proposed another estimator, which is a linear combination {{of the means of}} the matched and unmatched portion of the sample on the second occasion. The bias and mean square error of this combined estimator is also obtained. The optimum mean square error of this combined estimator was compared with (i) the optimum mean square error of the estimator proposed by Singh (2005) (ii) mean per unit estimator and (iii) combined estimator suggested by Cochran (1977) when no auxiliary information is used on any occasion.

40|$|The use of {{repeated}} surveys {{to estimate the}} population mean of a variable over time is approached as a time series problem. A survey carried out at time t yields an estimate Y(,t) of the population mean X(,t). We write Y(,t) = X(,t) + u(,t), where u(,t) is the survey error of estimation. If X(,t) follows a stochastic model, the problem of estimating X(,t) becomes one of estimating a time series observed subject to measurement error. In this work X(,t) is postulated to be an autoregressive process;In <b>rotation</b> <b>sampling</b> designs, the measurement error u(,t) can be modeled as a moving average process. An efficient estimation method, based upon {{the properties of the}} least squares estimators of an autoregressive moving average, is developed for the parameters of the X(,t) process.

40|$|We {{have been}} {{analyzing}} Itokawa samples {{in order to}} definitively establish the degree of shock experienced by the regolith of asteroid Itokawa, and to devise a bridge between shock determinations by standard light optical petrography, crystal structures as determined by electron and X-ray diffraction techniques. We are making measurements of olivine crystal structures and using these to elucidate critical regolith impact processes. We use electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD). We are comparing the Itokawa samples to L and LL chondrite meteorites chosen to span the shock scale experienced by Itokawa, specifically Chainpur (LL 3. 4, Shock Stage 1), Semarkona (LL 3. 00, S 2), Kilabo (LL 6, S 3), NWA 100 (L 6, S 4) and Chelyabinsk (LL 5, S 4). In SXRD we measure the line broadening of olivine reflections {{as a measure of}} shock stage. In this presentation we concentrate on the EBSD work. We employed JSC's Supra 55 variable pressure FEG-SEM and Bruker EBSD system. We are not seeking actual strain values, but rather indirect strain-related measurements such as extent of intra-grain lattice rotation, and determining whether shock state "standards" (meteorite samples of accepted shock state, and appropriate small grain size) show strain measurements that may be statistically differentiated, using a sampling of particles (number and size range) typical of asteroid regoliths. Using our system we determined that a column pressure of 9 Pa and no C-coating on the sample was optimal. We varied camera exposure time and gain to optimize mapping performance, concluding that 320 x 240 pattern pixilation, frame averaging of 3, 15 kV, and low extractor voltage yielded an acceptable balance of hit rate (> 90 %), speed (11 fps) and map quality using an exposure time of 30 ms (gain 650). We found that there was no strong effect of step size on Grain Orientation Spread (GOS) and Grain Reference Orientation Deviation angle (GROD-a) distribution; there was some effect on grain average Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM) (reduced with smaller step size for the same grain), as expected. We monitored GOS, Maximum Orientation Spread (MOS) and GROD-a differences between whole olivine grains and sub-sampled areas, and found that there were significant differences between the whole grain dataset and subsets, as well as between subsets, likely due to sampling-related "noise". Also, in general (and logically) whole grains exhibit greater degrees of cumulative lattice <b>rotation.</b> <b>Sampling</b> size affects the apparent strain character of the grain, at least as measured by GOS, MOS and GROD-a. There were differences in the distribution frequencies of GOS and MOS between shock stages, and in plots of MOS and GOS vs. grain diameter. These results are generally consistent with those reported this year. However, it is unknown whether the differences between samples of different shock states exceeds the clustering of these values to the extent that shock stage determinations can still be made with confidence. We are investigating this by examination of meteorites with higher shock stage 4 to 5. Our research will improve our understanding of how small, primitive solar system bodies formed and evolved, and improve understanding of the processes that determine the history and future of habitability of environments on other solar system bodies. The results will directly enrich the ongoing asteroid and comet exploration missions by NASA and JAXA, and broaden our understanding of the origin and evolution of small bodies in the early solar system, and elucidate the nature of asteroid and comet regolith...|$|E
