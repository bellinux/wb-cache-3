The article reviews manufacturer’s production programs <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills (Carmex, Emuge, Jel, Sandvik, Vargus) to show that, presently, there is a significant diversity <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mill designs for processing. The analysis allowed to reveal the main nomenclature and standard sizes <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills, including combined tools on their base, as well as to reveal classification signs and to develop classification <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills. Classification comprises also combined tools based on design <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mill, which allow us to reduce the nomenclature of the tools used in threading. The paper considers working schemes of the main types <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills and areas of their rational application. To analyse design data <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills two types of tools have been selected, namely the integral trailer edge thread mills with the spiral chip flutes and drill thread mills made from hard alloy.
