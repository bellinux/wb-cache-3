50|$|The Ponte dei Tre Archi {{connects the}} {{northern}} bank {{with the small}} fragment of the southern bank. The bridge’s arch acts as a <b>viewfinder,</b> <b>focusing</b> the viewer’s gaze onto the tiny patch of pure blue, breaking up the otherwise entirely urban landscape.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon AI-P {{versions}} enable full compatibility (except for autofocus) {{with all}} Nikon AF SLRs, {{similar to the}} AI-P manual-focus lenses Nikon has produced in the past. All metering patterns in 2-D mode, all program modes, and <b>viewfinder</b> <b>focus</b> indicators are available.|$|R
5000|$|... 1950: The first SLR with {{interchangeable}} <b>viewfinders</b> and <b>focusing</b> screens, the Exakta Varex.|$|R
50|$|The FTn {{also offered}} a choice (made at {{purchase}} time or by replacement at factory service centers) of brighter fixed <b>viewfinder</b> <b>focusing</b> screens: Nippon Kogaku's standard Type J with central 4 mm microprism focusing aid plus 12 mm etched circle indicating {{the area of}} the meter centerweighting or the Type A with central 3 mm split image rangefinder plus 12 mm etched circle.|$|R
50|$|The New F-1 is an {{expandable}} system. It {{consists of}} interchangeable <b>viewfinders,</b> <b>focusing</b> screens, motor drives, and alternate backs, {{all of which}} are specific to the New F-1. All other Canon components, such as the FD lens series, close up accessories (bellows, extension tubes, etc.), and Canon A and T Speedlights (except the 300TL) are also compatible with the system.|$|R
50|$|The F2 {{also had}} {{interchangeable}} <b>viewfinder</b> <b>focusing</b> screens. Nippon Kogaku's standard Type K screen had central 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm microprism collar focusing aids on a matte/Fresnel background plus a 12 mm etched circle indicating {{the area of}} the meter centerweighting. There were 18 other screens available with a variety of focusing aids or etched guidelines choices, including none at all. Note that the screens for the F2 were interchangeable with the ones for the Nikon F, but not with later F-series SLRs.|$|R
50|$|About 18 {{interchangeable}} camera lenses, some <b>viewfinders</b> and <b>focusing</b> screens, film holders (also {{for instant}} film), different bellows and extension rail sets for close ups were offered.|$|R

5000|$|A {{focusing}} screen is a flat translucent material, either a ground glass or fresnel lens, {{found in a}} system camera that allows the user of the camera to preview the framed image in a <b>viewfinder.</b> Often, <b>focusing</b> screens are available in variants with different etched markings for various purposes. For instance, [...] "overall matte" [...] {{focusing screen}}s with no etchings are a popular choice for astrophotography and other low-light situations.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{an earlier}} {{resolution}} {{to avoid the}} mass market, Rollei began to sell a <b>range</b> of <b>viewfinder</b> cameras for the amateur market. The cameras were made in Asia by Skanhex, Premier, Kyocera and Ricoh, among others, and sold under the brand name Rollei Prego. The product line initially consisted solely of 35 mm cameras; digital cameras were added later on - Rollei even began to develop these itself.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the Kodak Brownie Starlet, the Starflash {{features}} an integrated flashgun accepting M-2 style flashbulbs, {{as well as}} M-5 and M-25 bulbs for longer <b>range</b> photos. The <b>viewfinder</b> is slightly smaller to accommodate the large parabolic reflector.|$|R
5000|$|... 1950: Ihagee Exakta Varex (East Germany; called Exakta V in USA): first {{interchangeable}} <b>viewfinder,</b> first interchangeable <b>focusing</b> screens, first <b>viewfinder</b> {{condenser lens}} SLR. Original viewfinder selection was waist-level or pentaprism. For the next half-century, interchangeable viewfinder customization was the signal feature of fully professional level SLRs, {{although they have}} not made the transition to digital SLRs.|$|R
5000|$|Focus can be {{set with}} an active-infrared {{autofocus}} or by manual adjustment. In autofocus mode, a central indicator in the viewfindershows the point the camera will attempt to focus on and a lamp in the <b>viewfinder</b> indicatesthat <b>focus</b> has been achieved when the shutter release is half pressed. Focus remains lockeduntil the shutter release is pressed fully or the button released.Manual focus is initiated by {{a button on the}} top plate of the camera. Focus is adjusted byreading the focus distance from the top-mounted LCD and adjusted with the [...] "+" [...] and [...] "-"buttons. A single button can be pressed to lock focus at infinity.|$|R
50|$|The G Series was {{a unique}} 35 mm {{autofocus}} rangefinder system with interchangeable lenses. Rather than displaying a typical rangefinder focusing patch and brightlines, the first G1 had a zooming <b>viewfinder</b> with a <b>focus</b> confirmation light activated by the autofocus system if manual focus was required. The actual AF system, unlike AF for SLR cameras, used a twin-window rangefinder, but the alignment determination was electronic.|$|R
5000|$|M6 0.85 - 1998. The M6 {{could be}} {{optionally}} ordered with a [...]85 magnification <b>viewfinder</b> for easier <b>focusing</b> with long lenses and more accurate focusing with fast lenses, {{such as the}} 50 mm/f1.0 Noctilux and 75 mm/f1.4 Summilux. The 28 mm framelines are dropped in this model. 3,130 of these cameras were made (all black chrome), so {{they are among the}} rarer non-commemorative M6's.|$|R
50|$|The {{viewfinder}} uses projected parallax-correctedbrightline framelines {{which shows}} {{the field of view}} to be captured when a photograph istaken. The centre of the viewfinder shows the point at which autofocus will beattempted, and a lamp in the <b>viewfinder</b> indicates when <b>focus</b> hasbeen achieved. The viewfinder is located on the far upper left-hand side of the camera (whenseen from the rear) in a position similar to that traditionally used forrangefinder cameras.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how first generation migrants experience urban outdoor places, detailing significant findings and methodological development relating to two research projects. The research {{is located in}} Sheffield, England. The first research project (<b>Viewfinder)</b> <b>focuses</b> on young refugees and asylum seekers exploring citywide greenspaces and parks. The second project (Walking Voices) addresses a neighbourhood scale of interest, working with first generation migrant residents to communicate their own stories and experiences of their local area. Creative and participatory research methods were developed for on-site work, using photography and independent audio recording. The research found that spending time outside is an important means by which first generation migrants {{feel a sense of}} agency and belonging in a neighbourhood context. Though the research supports use of urban greenspace as beneficial to individual and collective wellbeing, it underlines the critical importance of understanding cultural dimensions – motivations and barriers - to visiting parks and other types of greenspace. Evaluation of a local environment is often shaped by migrants’ experiences of past places, and previous expectations of life in the UK. Place attachment is strengthened by participation and familiarity in a local located community, and often by recognising transcultural connections. The overlapping use of public space by people from different ethnic communities offers opportunities for gradual informal contact and gives a visual shared recognition to the diversity of a neighbourhood. However, the ability to make choices about when to engage with one’s own ethnic group, and when to retreat from the expectations of this ‘public gaze’ was also valued. The thesis examines the implications of these findings for landscape architecture practice, and emphasises that the profession needs to become more culturally literate in responding to the superdiversity of urban contexts, and to difference in social and cultural values with regard to recreation, socialising, and natural places...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} method of DSLR infrared photography {{is to remove}} the infrared blocker {{in front of the}} sensor {{and replace it with a}} filter that removes visible light. This filter is behind the mirror, so the camera can be used normally - handheld, normal shutter speeds, normal composition through the <b>viewfinder,</b> and <b>focus,</b> all work like a normal camera. Metering works but is not always accurate because of the difference between visible and infrared refraction. When the IR blocker is removed, many lenses which did display a hotspot cease to do so, and become perfectly usable for infrared photography. Additionally, because the red, green and blue micro-filters remain and have transmissions not only in their respective color but also in the infrared, enhanced infrared color may be recorded.|$|R
2500|$|The first SLR cameras with {{internal}} (“through-the-lens” or “TTL”) meters (e.g., the Pentax Spotmatic) {{required that the}} lens is stopped down to the working aperture when taking a meter reading. [...] With a small aperture, this darkened the <b>viewfinder,</b> making viewing, <b>focusing,</b> and composition difficult. Subsequent models soon incorporated mechanical coupling between the lens and the camera body, indicating the working aperture to the camera while allowing the lens to be at its maximum aperture for composition and focusing; this feature became known as automatic aperture control or automatic diaphragm control.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon D7000 is a 16.2-megapixel digital single-lens {{reflex camera}} (DSLR) model {{announced}} by Nikon on September 15, 2010. At {{the time of}} announcement, {{it was a new}} class of camera placed between the professional D300S and the midrange D90. The D7000 offers numerous professional-style features over the D90, such as magnesium alloy body construction, weather and moisture sealing, a 2,016-segment color exposure meter, built-in timed interval exposure features, 39 rather than 11 focus points, dual SD memory card slots, virtual horizon (in live view and viewfinder) and compatibility with older non-CPU autofocus and manual-focus AI and AI-S Nikon F-mount lenses (including an electronic rangefinder with three-segment <b>viewfinder</b> manual <b>focus</b> indication) as well as tilt-shift PC-E lenses. Other built-in features are a wireless flash commander, two user-customizable modes, full HD video with autofocus and mono audio (With support for an external stereo microphone), automatic correction of lateral chromatic aberration and support for GPS and WLAN.|$|R
50|$|The Topcon RE Super, or Beseler Topcon Super D in USA, was {{launched}} by Tokyo Kogaku KK in 1963 and manufactured until 1971, {{at which point}} it was upgraded to the Super D and again to Super DM the following year. General sale continued for several years. These later models have a shutter release lock lever on the shutter release collar. It is a professional oriented 35mm SLR camera that had a comprehensive range of accessories available. It has a removable pentaprism <b>viewfinder</b> and <b>focusing</b> screen. It features the Exakta bayonet lens mount for interchangeable lenses. A special accessory shoe is situated {{at the base of}} the rewind knob with a standard PC sync. contact next to it. The release button is placed at the right-hand camera front, but it lacks a mirror-up facility. This was included on the upgraded versions. The standard lens is the RE. Auto-Topcor 1:1.4 f=5.8cm or the slightly slower 1:1.8 version. A battery-operated winder to be attached to the camera base was made available.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was a full}} line of {{specialized}} equipment available for these system cameras that included microscope adaptor, extension bellows, stereo attachments, medical attachments and various specialized finder screens. Equipment is fully compatible between all models manufactured between 1936 and 1969. The spelling found on cameras has traditionally been Exakta, but some early Kine-Exaktas were marked Exacta specifically for marketing in France, Portugal and the U.S., perhaps for copyright reasons; and certainly {{a great number of}} American collectors refer to the whole range as the [...] "Exacta." [...] A related line of smaller, simpler cameras was the [...] "Exa" [...] line; these, too, existed in several variations. The Beseler Topcon line of 35mm cameras used the same lens mount as the Exakta. In the early 1970s the Exakta [...] "RTL 1000" [...] was introduced; it accepted the older models' lenses but had its own <b>range</b> of <b>viewfinders,</b> which included a model with through-the-lens light metering. M42 lens mount variants of the RTL line of cameras also appeared under the Practica name.|$|R

5000|$|The first lenses were plain stop-down design {{but many}} {{manufacturers}} extended the M42 lens mount to provide extra features. The first innovation was the pre-select type, which allowed an aperture value to be pre-selected without actually closing the aperture, {{with a separate}} ring to close down the aperture quickly to the chosen value. This gave the user the benefit of comfortable framing and focusing with a bright <b>viewfinder</b> and clear <b>focus</b> separation, and then closing the aperture without the need to remove the eye from the eyepiece. A further development followed with [...] "auto" [...] lenses, which have a pin in the mount which closes the aperture against a spring to the chosen setting when it is pushed. This was adopted as a common standard by virtually all lens manufacturers. Cameras designed for these lenses have a bar {{in the bottom of}} the mount which depresses the pin when the shutter is released. The first cameras, such as the Praktica Nova range, used physical finger pressure on the shutter button to operate the bar and close the aperture, allowing a stopped-down preview of the depth of field before the shutter fired. However, this function was removed in later Praktica models because some users found it was possible, with longer exposure times, to release the shutter button and open the aperture before the shutter had closed. The bar on Pentax Spotmatic cameras is operated by spring pressure with timing linked to the shutter, but these cameras also had a separate switch for the light meter circuit which closed the aperture and gave the depth of field preview in this way. To allow auto lenses to be used on earlier cameras without the bar, many lenses were provided with a switch or button to put the lens into stop-down mode, commonly referred to as the Auto-Manual or A/M switch.|$|R
5000|$|As {{expected}} {{of a professional}} camera at the time, the LX provides mechanical shutter speeds, ranging from the flash synchronization ('X') speed of 1/75 second to 1/2000 second and bulb ('B'), permitting manual operation without battery power. The slow speeds from 1/60 second to 4 seconds, {{as well as the}} exposure meter, are battery dependent. Construction is strong and durable, with a solid cast metal frame and metal covering plates. All buttons and dials are weather and dust sealed, a unique feature not found on other professional cameras of the day. Underneath the satin black finish is black chrome, so that even as the surface finish inevitably wore through in hard professional use, the underlying metal would not look brassy. Both the <b>viewfinder</b> and the <b>focusing</b> screen are interchangeable to suit the task at hand, a large choice of alternatives were available. The camera has a somewhat uncommon frame counter, being able {{to keep track of the}} frame number in either direction, whether advancing or rewinding the film; this feature dramatically adds to the flexibility of the camera, as well as aids in multiple exposures. The camera has a multi-function lever that supports mirror lock-up, self-timer and depth of field preview. Both a winder and motor drive were available, and a full complement of other professional accessories. Many additional features could be found inside the camera, the [...] "Magic-Needles" [...] ringed the film take-up spool. Found on M-series bodies, it was included in the LX to make loading a quick task. The shutter curtains are made of a Titanium foil composite and a small thumb operated dial sit to the side of the film plane to operate a mask that could be deployed for use with the time data back when installed in place of the standard back. As stated about the mask for data back, Pentax offered two types. The time stamp version that included a wristwatch style component that was inserted in the back and projected on to the deployed mask. The other data back was a three digit type that could project dates or useful information on to the film. Also taking advantage of the removable back was a high capacity magazine allowing for 250 exposures.|$|R
