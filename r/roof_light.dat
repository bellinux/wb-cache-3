5|$|Bombs often {{landed on}} the estate during the blitz of Bristol. In September 1940, during a raid on the Bristol Aeroplane Company factory at Filton, bombs cut off the estate's water supply, and during a later raid, one bomb badly damaged the lantern <b>roof</b> <b>light</b> over the hallway. In 1946, {{after the end of}} the war, Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for a repair grant, but was turned down. As a result damp, and latterly birds, entered the house through the <b>roof</b> <b>light,</b> until the house came into the {{ownership}} of the National Trust and was repaired.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{a number}} of rooms feature period wall and ceiling decorations {{including}} the entrance hall, which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded panelling and cornices, a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster ceiling and an arabesque frieze. The stairwell is lit from above with a <b>roof</b> <b>light</b> and features a cantilevered stair with iron balusters from the 1825 adaptation with a later brass handrail.|$|E
5|$|Built with a {{range of}} shops to both sides, the modernist design of the {{entrance}} vestibule {{takes the form of a}} double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The ticket hall beyond is octagonal with a central <b>roof</b> <b>light</b> of the same shape. The ticket hall originally had a pair of wooden ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E

25|$|The boro taxis {{are various}} car makes and models, {{but they are}} all painted an {{identical}} color of apple green, with standard marking on the vehicles. The vehicles are equipped with GPS, debit/credit card reader, a meter, a <b>roof</b> <b>light</b> and a camera or a partition, {{in the same way}} as the yellow taxis are, and the meter fares are the same as in the yellow taxis. The equipped GPS is also used by the city to track and enforce that there are no pick-ups within the yellow zone.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} GPS, debit/credit card reader, a meter, a <b>roof</b> <b>light</b> and a camera or a partition {{in the same way}} as in the yellow cabs. The meter fares for street hailed trips are the same rate as in the yellow cabs. Boro taxis are still considered a car service, therefore customers can call their bases for pre-arranged trips in the same way that they normally do with other car services. The pre-arranged trips can pick up passengers in the outer boroughs including the airports and northern Manhattan, but are still prohibited from picking up any passengers below East 96th and West 110th streets.|$|E
25|$|Before 2011, a cab's {{availability}} {{was indicated}} by {{the lights on the}} top of the car. When no lights were lit, the cab would be occupied by passengers. When just the center light showing the medallion number was lit, the cab would be empty and available. When the OFF and DUTY inscriptions to either side of the medallion number were lit, with the medallion number off, the cab would be off duty and not accepting passengers. However, when the OFF and DUTY inscriptions were lit and the medallion number was still lit, the cab would be off duty but the driver could choose to pick up passengers heading in the same direction as the driver. In fall 2011, the TLC announced a plan to replace the three-light system with a simple indicator as to whether the taxi is available. In 2012, the TLC simplified the light system further, with a lit <b>roof</b> <b>light</b> indicating that the taxi is available and an unlit light indicating that the taxi is not available, regardless of whether it has passengers or is simply off duty. It also started fining drivers $100 for picking up passengers without the light on, except for if the driver is picking up their last passenger of their shift.|$|E

2500|$|Chamberlain, Powell and Bon were {{commissioned}} {{to design the}} Physical Education Centre which was built in 1966. The main characteristic of the building is {{the roof of the}} changing rooms and small gymnasium which has hyperbolic paraboloid <b>roof</b> <b>light</b> shells and is completely paved in quarry tiles. The roof of the sports hall consists of eight conoidal 2½-inch thick sprayed concrete shells springing from [...] long pre-stressed valley beams. On the south elevation, the roof is supported on raking pre-cast columns and reversed shells form a cantilevered canopy.|$|E

60|$|It is by {{this time}} drawing on to dinner time. The table is laid {{on the roof of}} the palace; and thither Rufio is now climbing, ushered by a majestic palace official, wand of office in hand, and {{followed}} by a slave carrying an inlaid stool. After many stairs they emerge at last into a massive colonnade on the <b>roof.</b> <b>Light</b> curtains are drawn between the columns on the north and east to soften the westering sun. The official leads Rufio to one of these shaded sections. A cord for pulling the curtains apart hangs down between the pillars.|$|E
60|$|The chief {{leading the}} way, I {{followed}} {{through the open}} entrance of the courtyard. The yard was very spacious, and under the dark shade of the trees I could see a light {{here and there in}} the windows of small huts along the walls, where, as I found later, the slaves and the young men of the family slept. In the middle of the space there was another altar, I am sorry to say; indeed, there were altars everywhere. I never heard of a people so religious, in their own darkened way, as these islanders. At the further end of the court was a really large and even stately house, with no windows but a clerestory, indicated by the line of light from within, flickering between the top of the wall {{and the beginning of the}} high-pitched <b>roof.</b> <b>Light</b> was also streaming through the wide doorway, from which came the sound of many voices. The house was obviously full of people, and, just before we reached the deep verandah, a roofed space open to the air in front, they began to come out, some of them singing. They had flowers in their hair, and torches in their hands. The chief, giving me a sign to be silent, drew me apart within the shadow of a plane tree, and we waited there till the crowd dispersed, and went, I presume, to their own houses. There were no women among them, and the men carried no spears nor other weapons. When the court was empty, we walked up the broad stone steps and stood within the doorway. I was certainly much surprised at what I saw. There was a rude magnificence about this house such as I had never expected to find in the South Sea Islands. Nay, though I am not unacquainted with the abodes of opulence at home, and have been a favoured guest of some of our merchant princes (including Messrs. Bunton, the eminent haberdashers, whose light is so generously bestowed on our Connection), I admit that I had never looked on a more spacious reception-room, furnished, of course, in a somewhat savage manner, but, obviously, regardless of expense. The very threshold between the court and the reception-room, to which you descended by steps, was made of some dark metal, inlaid curiously with figures of beasts and birds, also in metal (gold, as I afterwards learned), of various shades of colour and brightness.|$|E

5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living <b>roofs,</b> <b>light</b> covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, <b>light</b> surfaces, <b>light</b> <b>roofs,</b> and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} the problems connected with new offers on a daylight factor design in premises with <b>roof</b> natural <b>lighting</b> system with account of lighting effect of surrounding buildings. The offers for daylight design {{are based on}} a hypothesis of possible use of some design points for side natural lighting of interiors in the design of <b>roof</b> natural <b>lighting.</b> This is connected with a need to account for a lighting effect of neighborhood buildings. This effect must be considered in the case of lighting design for underground or sub-around buildings. These theoretical offers were confirmed with practical experiment results. The problem, discussed in the article has been stated and analyzed before by a number of domestic and foreign authors. These questions arose mainly because of the broad developing activity in the construction of underground and below-ground buildings and structures, mainly bound with public premises. The need of such development {{can be explained by the}} lack of vacant city areas, especially in the central parts. Moreover, the construction methods of such a development are much simpler, as compared with traditional construction technologies of above-ground objects. As for indoor lighting conditions in the underground and below-ground buildings, the only possible way to provide sufficient lighting of interiors is an implementation of <b>roof</b> <b>lighting</b> system in the form of skylights or monitors with one-side or two-side glazing. It is obvious, however, that these <b>roof</b> <b>lighting</b> units are influenced by shadowing effect of the surrounding buildings, which can decrease the incoming light flow to the interiors. This point is the main one, which forced the authors to investigate this scientific problem...|$|R
