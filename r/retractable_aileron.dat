40|$|A large-chord NACA 23012 airfoil was tested. The airfoil {{extended}} completely {{across the}} test section, and two-dimensional flow was approximated. The model was {{fitted with a}} full-span slotted flap having a chord 25. 66 percent of the airfoil chord. The ailerons investigated extended over the entire span and each had a chord 10 percent of the airfoil chord. The types of ailerons tested were: retractable ailerons, slot-lip ailerons using {{the lip of the}} slot for ailerons, and plain ailerons on the trailing edge of the slotted flap. The data are presented in the form of curves of section lift, drag, and pitching-moment coefficients for the airfoil with flap deflected but with ailerons neutral, and of rolling-moment, yawing-moment, and hinge-moment coefficients calculated for a rectangular wing of aspect ratio 6 with a semi-span aileron and a full-span flap. For the ailerons investigated the data indicate that, from considerations of rolling and yawing moments produced and of stick forces desired, the <b>retractable</b> <b>aileron</b> is the most satisfactory means of lateral control for use with a full-span slotted flap...|$|E
40|$|A {{low-speed}} wind-tunnel {{investigation was}} made to determine the lateral control characteristics {{of a series of}} untapered low-aspect-ratio wings. Sealed flap ailerons of various spans and spanwise locations were investigated on unswept wings of aspect ratios 1. 13, 1. 13, 4. 13, and 6. 13; and various projections of 0. 60 -semispan <b>retractable</b> <b>ailerons</b> were investigated on the unsweptback wings of aspect ratios 1. 13, 2. 13, and 4. 13 and on a 45 degree sweptback wing.

40|$|Sectional {{characteristics}} of airfoil having retractable slotted flap with plain, slot-lip, or <b>retractable</b> <b>ailerons</b> are presented {{for a large}} range of aileron deflections. The analysis indicated that pitching moments produced by spoilers were less positive than those produced by plain flaps of equal effectiveness, also that pitching moments created by the spoiler increased less with the Mach number than similar moments produced by plain flaps.

40|$|A flight {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the lateral-control characteristics of <b>retractable</b> <b>ailerons</b> installed on a highly tapered wing. The effectiveness of the ailerons in producing roll was measured at various air speeds with full-span plain flaps both neutral and deflected 45 degrees. The direction of the yawing moment created by the ailerons was also noted. The lateral control provided by the <b>retractable</b> <b>ailerons</b> used in this {{investigation was}} approximately {{the same as that}} obtained with the plain ailerons of equal span with which the airplane was previously equipped. The amount of control available was found to be somewhat inadequate, apparently because of the rather short span of the ailerons (0. 327 of the wing span). It is likely that, with an aileron span of from 0. 50 to 0. 60 of the wing span, a satisfactory degree of control would be obtained. With the full-span flaps deflected 45 degrees, the rolling action of the ailerons was increased about 30 percent over that obtained with the flaps neutral at the same speed. The yawing moment produced by the ailerons was in the same sense as the rolling moment, i. e., right roll was accompanied by yaw. Lag in the response of the rolling action to control application was not large enough to be noticed by the pilots. No appreciable control force was apparent to the pilots, which was considered somewhat undesirable. Minor modifications {{in the design of the}} ailerons, however, would probably correct this fault...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the undesirable delayed action, or lag, of the spoiler-type lateral control device {{led to the development}} of the NACA slot-lip aileron. The tests were made in the 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel with a 4 - by 8 -foot wing hinged at the tunnel jet boundary and taken of the motion of the control device under test and of the resulting wing motion. First, the lag, as affected by the fore-and-aft location of <b>retractable</b> <b>ailerons</b> or spoilers was determined. The lag was found to increase regularly as the spoiler was moved from the rear of the wing toward the front. Then a combination of spoilers and fixed slot was developed that, with the spoiler retracting into the forward part of the slot, reduced the time lag to a negligible value. In addition, an arrangement was developed using a hinged aileron-type flap as the upper portion, or lip, of a slot through the wing. This arrangement appears to be usable as a form of lateral control device that shows promise of giving improved control and stability at the high angles of attack through stall, with negligible lag, low control forces, and relatively simple construction...|$|R

[...] The 707 programme provided valuable insights into the Vulcan's flight characteristics, most of the information coming from the second and third prototypes which flew before the Vulcan. All 707s were powered by a single Rolls-Royce Derwent centrifugal turbojet. The air intake on the first prototype and later 707B was located on the upper rear fuselage.

40|$|Tests of a partial-span {{model of}} a large bomber-type air 1 ane were {{conducted}} to determine the. aerodynamic characteristics of the wing equipped with full-span flaps and a <b>retractable</b> spoiler end <b>aileron</b> lateral control system. The arrangement consisted of (1) a double slotted flap extending over aproximate 1 y 86 percent of the wing semispan, (2) a 20 -percent constant-percentage-chord aileron extending from the outboard end of the flap to the wing tip, and (3) a retractable spoiler, located at the 65 -percent wing-chord station and extending from approximately 63 percent of the wing semispan to the wing tip. In addition, tests were made of a wing vent (of 1 and 2 percent of the wing chord located directly behind the spoiler), perforations in the spoiler, a blot or cut-out along the lower edge of the spoiler and spoilers of various spans. With full-span flaps deflected and with the 2 -percent vent open or closed the initial stalling of the wing occurred at the tips, but with the vents closed there probably would be no appreciable loss in lateral control until maximum lift was reached. The l-percent vent increased the rolling effectiveness of the spoiler at small spoi 1 er deflections, particularly at high angles of attack with flaps deflected. With flaps deflected the 2 -percent vent caused a large reduction in both the wing lift and rolling effectiveness of the spoiler at large angles of attack. However, at small angle of attack the 2 -percent vent increased the rolling effectiveness of the spoiler at small spoiler deflections. The simultaneous operation of the spoiler and vent (in contrast to a vent fixed in the wing) {{would result in a}} large increase in the effectiveness of the spoiler and would avoid any loss in wing lift as in a fixed vent arrangement. The tests of the spoiler modifications revealed that (1) the spoiler perforations reduced the rolling-moment and yawing-moment coefficients but caused the spoiler hinge-moment coefficients to become more positive; (2) the spoiler slot had no notable effect on the rolling-moment and yawing-moment characteristics but produced a positive increase in the spoiler hinge-moment coefficients at large spoiler deflections; (3) the effects produced by the individual modifications were additive when the various modifications were combined. In general, progressively decreasing the spoiler span by removing the segments from the inboard end of the spoiler caused a decrease in rolling effectiveness approximately proportional to the span of the segment...|$|R
