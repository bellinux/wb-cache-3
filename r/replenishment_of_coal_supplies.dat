40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} paper is to assess the security <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>supply</b> to Eskom in the short and medium term. It seeks to accomplish this by identifying and analyzing factors that affect the security <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>supply</b> to Eskom. It will also examine the need for government coordination to ensure there is a secure <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> to Eskom. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopted a cross sectional research design approach. It used semi-structured interviews to collect data from nine coal industry experts in South Africa. The {{data were analyzed using}} coding methods. Findings: The security <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>supply</b> is affected by the price <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> returns on investments in coal mines, the nature <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> contracts with Eskom, decision making at Eskom, problems with the mines, relationships with the industry, regulatory uncertainties, investments in coal mines, and the logistics infrastructure to transport and deliver coal. The findings on the need for coordination were not definitive. Analysis and Conclusions: The identified factors are intertwined and affect one another. The <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> to Eskom is not secure in the short and medium term. This is threatened by two key events and an issue. The events are the expiry of short and medium term contracts in 2018 and the full operation of Kusile as currently expected in 2022. The issue is a lack of reinvestments in costplus coal mines...|$|R

40|$|Fossil fuels still {{constitute}} {{an important source}} of energy in the world, but they need to comply with more strict environmental requirements. The coal industry, the basic primary energy supplier to the Polish economy, not only faces new environmental regulations but also restructuring and changes in the industry¿s organisational structure. The issues of primary importance are the medium and longterm prospects of achieving a suitable quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>supplied,</b> as well as suitable costs. The structure of power generation needs to adjust to emissions limits with given fuel supplies. The paper discusses the construction <b>of</b> a <b>coal</b> <b>supply</b> balancing system which has been developed and applied as a decision support for rational planning of the development <b>of</b> the Polish <b>coal</b> industry. It consists of two linked groups <b>of</b> models: <b>coal</b> <b>supply</b> and <b>coal</b> balancing. Such a structure allows it to respond to the problems emerging for the most part from new environmental regulations, and to select policies that will lead to sustainability in the industry. JRC.

40|$|AbstractObject-oriented Petri Net {{modeling}} <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>supply</b> chain {{system can}} be established {{from the perspective of}} workflow by applying the technology of object-orientation and Petri net. On the basis of the modeling, profit maximization optimization for the selection of resources and the environment in a certain condition to meet customer demand is taken as the <b>coal</b> <b>supply</b> chain optimization objective. And under the quantitative description and analysis of the internal nodes, logistics, capital flow and information flow in <b>coal</b> <b>supply</b> chain system, the optimal method is used for objective optimization. Through this research, we have learned that the use of the method in <b>coal</b> <b>supply</b> chain modeling and objective optimization can accurately reflect the operation <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> <b>supply</b> chain and its resource constraints, which will finally improve decision-making performance. The complex systems can be highly abstracted by using this OPN model which is also easy for expansion and optimization model has a strong versatility...|$|R

40|$|Coal {{exports from}} the US to Asia are declining {{over time as}} a result of (1) {{increased}} competition from coal suppliers within the Asia-Pacific region, (2) changing steel making technologies, (3) decreased emphasis on security <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>supplies,</b> and (4) deregulation of the energy industry [...] particularly electric utilities. There are no major changes on the horizon that are likely to alter the role of the US as a modest coal supplier to the Asia-Pacific region. The downward trend in US coal exports to Asia is expected to continue over the 1997 [...] 2010 period. But economic and policy changes underway in Asia are likely to result in periodic coal shortages, lasting a few months to a year, and short term increased export opportunities for US coal. US coal exports to Asia are projected to fluctuate within the following ranges over the 2000 [...] 2010 period: 10 [...] 17 million tons in total exports, 6 [...] 12 million tons in thermal coal exports, and 4 [...] 9 million tons in coking coal exports. The most important role for US coal, from the perspective <b>of</b> Asian <b>coal</b> importing countries, is to ensure a major alternative source <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>supplies</b> that can be turned to in the event of unforeseen disruptions in <b>coal</b> <b>supplies</b> from the Asia-Pacific region or South Africa. However, the willingness of consumers to pay a premium to ensure US export capacity is declining, with increased emphasis on obtaining the lowest cost <b>coal</b> <b>supplies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The game {{models were}} used to study the {{mechanism}} of coal-electricity price conflict under conditions of double price regulations <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and electricity. Based on this, the peak shaving reserve mechanism was designed to probe into the countermeasures against the coal-electricity price conflicts. The study revealed that in the boom seasons <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> demand, the initiatives <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> enterprises to <b>supply</b> thermal <b>coal</b> and the electricity enterprises to order thermal coal are reduced under conditions of double price regulations. However, under the circumstances <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> price marketization, in the boom seasons <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> demand the thermal coal price may go up obviously, the initiatives <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> enterprises to <b>supply</b> thermal <b>coal</b> are increased, and meanwhile the initiatives of the power enterprises to order thermal coal are decreased dramatically. The transportation capacity constraint <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>supply</b> leads to the evident decrease of the initiatives <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> enterprises for the thermal <b>coal</b> <b>supply.</b> The mechanism <b>of</b> peak shaving reserve <b>of</b> thermal <b>coal</b> may not only reduce the price <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> market but also increase the enthusiasm of the power enterprises to order more thermal coal and the initiatives <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> enterprises to <b>supply</b> more thermal <b>coal...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the issues <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>supply</b> and {{blending}} pertaining to an electric utility company in Taiwan. Since the fuel used by coal-fired power plants are mainly imported in bulk from overseas sources, the planning <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> shipping and blending is of great economic importance. This operation involves the consideration of (1) each contract's <b>coal</b> <b>supply,</b> quality and price, (2) each power plant's demand, environmental constraints and limit on the maximum number <b>of</b> different <b>coal</b> sources that can supply it, (3) installation of blending facilities and (4) the transient seaport's shipload capacity. A mixed-integer zero-one programming model is presented for finding optimal shipping and blending decisions <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> fuel from each overseas contract to each power plant. A solution procedure is developed that employs heuristic rules in conjunction with branch-and-bound methods, and is illustrated using real-world data collected from the electric power company.
