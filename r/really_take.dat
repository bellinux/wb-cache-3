Hoping to become a cartoonist, he began to study architecture in 1993 at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts as {{he thought it would}} help him to improve his drawing skills. Only after he had been studying for a couple of years, did he <b>really</b> <b>take</b> an interest in architecture. He continued his studies at the Escola Tècnica Superior d'Arquitectura in Barcelona, and returned to Copenhagen to receive his diploma in 1999. As a third-year student in Barcelona, he set up his first practice and won his first competition.|$|E

In 1727, Sultan Achmed III gave his permission for the establishment of the first legal print house for printing secular works in Arabic script (religious publications still remained forbidden), but printing activities did not <b>really</b> <b>take</b> off until the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The first {{recorded}} Clyde racing yacht, a 46-ton cutter, {{was built by}} Scotts of Greenock in 1803, and the great Scottish yacht designer William Fyfe did not start designing yachts until 1807. The first yacht club on the Clyde was the Northern Yacht Club, which appeared in 1824 and received its Royal Charter in 1831. The club was founded to organise and encourage the sport, and by 1825 Scottish and Irish clubs were racing against {{each other on the}} Clyde. However, yachting and yacht building didn't <b>really</b> <b>take</b> off until the middle of the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|Dick Adler of the Los Angeles Times {{gave the}} {{documentary}} a positive review, writing: [...] "'The Lord of the Universe' doesn't <b>really</b> <b>take</b> sides, which doesn't mean it's a bland hour {{trying to please}} everybody. [...] Its considerable bite comes first from the material TVTV so carefully gathered and there from the artfully wise frame in which it chose to present it." [...] Deirdre Boyle wrote in Art Journal that the piece was [...] "the zenith of TVTV's guerrilla-TV style". According to Boyle's Subject to Change: Guerrilla Television Revisited, as in all TVTV tapes, everyone in the documentary comes across as foolish, describing the production's sarcasm as the [...] "ultimate leveler" [...] using equal irony [...] "both with the mighty and the lowly".|$|E

500|$|Asch {{told his}} colleagues that his studies of {{conformity}} were informed by his childhood experiences in Poland. He recalled being {{seven years old}} and staying up for his first Passover night. He recalls seeing his grandmother pour an extra glass of wine. When he asked who the glass of wine was for, she {{said that it was}} for the prophet Elijah. He then asked her whether Elijah would <b>really</b> <b>take</b> a sip from the glass and his uncle assured him that he would. His uncle told him to watch very closely when the time came. [...] "Filled with a sense of suggestion and expectation" [...] Asch [...] "thought he saw the level of wine in the cup drop just a bit". Thus, early in life, Asch succumbed to social pressure, an experience which led him to investigate conformity later in life.|$|E
500|$|Army {{engineers}} {{determined by}} 5:30p.m. {{on the first}} day that no one remained alive in the damaged section of the building. In the days after the crash, news reports emerged that up to 800 people had died. Army soldiers from Fort Belvoir were the first teams to survey the interior of the crash site and noted the presence of human remains. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Urban Search and Rescue teams, including Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue assisted the search for remains, working through the National Interagency Incident Management System (NIIMS). Kevin Rimrodt, a Navy photographer surveying the Navy Command Center after the attacks, remarked that [...] "there were so many bodies, I'd almost step on them. So I'd have to <b>really</b> <b>take</b> care to look backwards as I'm backing up in the dark, looking with a flashlight, making sure I'm not stepping on somebody". Debris from the Pentagon was taken to the Pentagon's north parking lot for more detailed search for remains and evidence.|$|E

[...] The action followed several days of rumours and a PC caucus meeting in which that party agreed to accept the Wildrose members. Smith said that several conversations with Prentice revealed that they shared much common ground, particularly on fiscal issues. Ultimately, she concluded that it made little sense for her to continue in opposition. [...] "If you’re going to be the official Opposition leader," [...] she said, [...] "you have to really want to take down the government and <b>really</b> <b>take</b> down the premier. I don't want to take down this premier. I want this premier to succeed." ...|$|E

Lindsey Thomas of Rolling Stone named Dwight interrogating {{the workers in}} the Office after finding the joint {{in the parking lot}} one of the top twenty-five scenes from the show, ranking it at number fifteen. Alan Sepinwall of The Seattle Times wrote that [...] "'Drug Testing' (in which Rainn Wilson's supercilious Dwight paraded around the office wearing a Smokey Bear hat and carrying a coffee cup filled with undrinkable liquid)" [...] allowed the show to finally make [...] "The Leap." [...] Brendan Babish of DVD Verdict was pleased with the entry and awarded it an [...] "A–". He was pleased with the episode's emphasis on Dwight and called it [...] "a far better showcase for Dwight's many charms than 'Dwight's Speech'." [...] M. Giant of Television Without Pity awarded the episode an [...] "A". Not all reviews were so glowing. Michael Sciannamea of AOL TV was more critical of the episode and wrote that he [...] "didn't think this episode was so hot", calling the premise [...] "a good idea that didn't <b>really</b> <b>take</b> off". He also disliked Jim and Pam's subplot and called it [...] "rather childish" [...] and wrote that it [...] "didn't seem to go anywhere".|$|E
500|$|Guandique faced {{a minimum}} penalty of 30 {{years to a}} maximum of life {{imprisonment}} without the possibility of parole. In seeking the maximum possible sentence, the prosecutors stated that Guandique [...] "is unable to control himself and thus, will always remain a danger to women". A memo submitted by the prosecution in February 2011 cited Guandique's harassment of female staff in prison, including soliciting a nurse and masturbating in front of guards. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez disclosed that he had traveled to El Salvador with a detective to investigate allegations that Guandique had fled his native country because of suspected attacks against local women dating back to 1999. During the sentencing hearing on February 11, Guandique said to Levy's family, [...] "I am sorry for what happened to your daughter", and insisted on his innocence. Before Judge Gerald Fisher reminded Susan Levy to address the court instead of the defendant, Levy said to him, [...] "Did you <b>really</b> <b>take</b> her life? Look me in my eyes and tell me." [...] Fisher denied Guandique's motion for retrial and handed down a sentence of 60 years in prison, stating that Guandique [...] "will be a danger for some time. He's a sexual predator." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B on an A+ to F scale, writing that the [...] "episode didn’t <b>really</b> <b>take</b> {{advantage}} of Jack Burton's {{return to the}} show. Instead, it pushed him off to the sidelines {{to make room for}} a storyline that had no earthly business in this episode." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a nice break from the Volkoff drama". Melody Simpson of Buzz Focus wrote, [...] "This story line has the potential to bring lots of drama but the way that it has been building up to this moment." [...] Stephen Lackey of Mania called the episode [...] "fun stuff just lacking in drama where drama was required." [...] Brittany Frederick of Starpulse wrote that the episode reminded her [...] "of all the reasons I fell in love with this show a year ago. It's fun, and funny without being campy, but more importantly, it's got heart. It's an episode that made me think, 'This is why people fight for this show season after season.' If it helps turn out more episodes like these, Gary Cole can drop by anytime he likes. I, for one, will be glad to see him." ...|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Simon Vozick-Levinson graded {{the album}} B− and praised the [...] "hard-edged" [...] tracks such as [...] "Got Dynamite", calling them {{suggestions}} of [...] "a direction that might set her apart {{in years to}} come". Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra rated the album three stars and wrote: [...] "Despite the Disney machine's presence, Here We Go Again doesn't rely too heavily on 'tween trends, instead relying on Lovato's penchant for rock-drama and teaming her with a slew of older, established acts." [...] Kerri Mason of Billboard praised the album for not relying heavily on production and Auto-Tune, calling Lovato [...] "a natural talent who could <b>really</b> <b>take</b> flight after outgrowing Disney". Mason wrote that the album includes [...] "quiet surprises" [...] and potential hits, particularly praising the title track and [...] "Catch Me". Jeff Miers from The Buffalo News rated Here We Go Again {{two and a half}} stars out of four, writing: [...] "Unlike so many of her Disney-fied peers, Lovato can really sing, and part of what makes her sophomore effort appealing is the lack of in-studio vocal manipulation." [...] Miers wrote that it is [...] "refreshing" [...] that Lovato does not need Auto-Tune [...] "to mask any lack of natural ability". He concluded by calling the album [...] "safe and pretty predictable, but also incredibly catchy".|$|E
500|$|Mark Washburn of Knight Ridder {{wrote that}} at the time of the episode's broadcast, most Americans were {{accustomed}} to seeing homosexual characters on television. He said this is why Patty's coming-out did not become as controversial as the episode's examination of the same-sex marriage issue, which was more sensitive in the country then. The controversy became so big that local news programs in certain cities aired segments about it. In response to the claims that this episode was supporting gay marriage, Al Jean replied that [...] "we don't <b>really</b> <b>take</b> any positions for or against anything, we just like to examine all sides of an issue and I think that anyone who would get their political wisdom from a cartoon might be sadly mistaken." [...] Likewise, Mark Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons that once the episode ended, it was hard to tell what stance on same-sex marriage the writers had and that [...] "both sides of the controversy had their say, voiced by various Simpsons characters". Jean has also cited the episode in defense to critics who say The Simpsons has lost its relevance and edginess in later years. In his book , John Ortved responded to this, commenting that despite the controversies the episode was [...] "in fact a long-winded and lame exploration of the topic." ...|$|E
500|$|US President Barack Obama {{stated in}} June 2012: [...] "Right now, [...] focus {{has to be}} on {{strengthening}} their overall banking system...making a series of decisive actions that give people confidence that the banking system is solid... In addition, they're {{going to have to look}} at how do they achieve growth at the same time as they're carrying out structural reforms that may take two or three or five years to fully accomplish. So countries like Spain and Italy, for example, have embarked on some smart structural reforms that everybody thinks are necessary—everything from tax collection to labour markets to a whole host of different issues. But they've got to have the time and the space for those steps to succeed. And if they are just cutting and cutting and cutting, and their unemployment rate is going up and up and up, and people are pulling back further from spending money because they're feeling a lot of pressure—ironically, that can actually make it harder for them to carry out some of these reforms over the long term... n addition to sensible ways to deal with debt and government finances, there's a parallel discussion that's taking place among European leaders to figure out how do we also encourage growth and show some flexibility to allow some of these reforms to <b>really</b> <b>take</b> root." ...|$|E
