5|$|Dan Dugan (born March 20, 1943) is an American audio engineer, inventor, {{and nature}} sounds <b>recordist.</b> He {{was the first}} person in {{regional}} theatre to be called a sound designer, and he developed the first effective automatic microphone mixer: the automixer. Dugan's sound design work was acknowledged in 2003 with a Distinguished Career Award by the United States Institute for Theatre Technology.|$|E
5|$|In early 1929 Robey {{returned}} to South Africa and then Canada for another tour with Bits and Pieces, {{after which he}} started another series of variety dates back in England. Among the towns he visited was Woolwich, where he performed to packed audiences {{over the course of}} a week. Here he met the theatre managers Frank and Agnes Littler, with the latter briefly becoming his manager. In 1932 Robey appeared in his first sound film, The Temperance Fête, and followed this with Marry Me, which was, according to his biographer A. E. Wilson, one of the most successful musical films of the comedian's career. The film tells the story of a sound <b>recordist</b> in a gramophone company who romances a colleague when she becomes the family housekeeper.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{services}} featured in the film were one-off events. For example, the wedding was shot at Lyng, where the bride's father was the rector. The bridegroom, Nigel McCulloch, {{went on to become}} the Bishop of Manchester. The production encountered difficulties with obtaining some footage; while filming a Seaman's Mission from Great Yarmouth, a wave flooded the boat, ruining the sound-recording equipment, and a sequence featuring an open-air service taking place at daybreak on Easter Sunday at the most easterly point of the UK — at Ness Point, Lowestoft — was nearly missed after the sound <b>recordist</b> overslept.|$|E
5000|$|Miniature {{binaural}} [...] "in-ear" [...] or [...] "near-ear" [...] microphones can {{be linked}} to a portable Digital Audio Tape (DAT) or MiniDisc recorder, bypassing the need for a dummy head by using the <b>recordist's</b> own head. The first clip-in binaural microphones using the <b>recordist's</b> own head were offered by Sennheiser in 1974. The first clip-on binaural microphones using the <b>recordist's</b> own head were offered by Core Sound LLC in 1989. The first completely [...] "in-ear" [...] binaural microphones using the <b>recordist's</b> own head were offered by Sound Professionals in 1999. Roland Corporation also offers its CS-10EM in-ear binaural microphone set.|$|R

5|$|After he {{graduated}} {{with a degree in}} civil engineering from Siddhartha Engineering College in Vijayawada, Ram Gopal Varma opened a video-rental shop in Ameerpet. Noting his son's interest in films, Penmatsa Krishnamraju (a former sound <b>recordist</b> for Annapurna Studios) helped Varma join the teams of Collector Gari Abbai (1987) and Rao Gari Illu (1988) as an assistant director. Varma befriended actor Akkineni Nagarjuna, and filmmakers Akkineni Venkat and Yarlagadda Surendra. He presented his script for Raathri to them. When Nagarjuna rejected it, Varma presented another script based on his life as a student in Vijayawada. He earlier narrated this script to filmmaker Kovelamudi Raghavendra Rao who suggested few changes because of its serious tone. Varma watched Rao's Kaliyuga Pandavulu (1986) and backed out after understanding Rao's point of view.|$|E

30|$|Associates {{would be}} {{verified}} sound workers, whether researchers, designers, or <b>recordists.</b> They {{would be able}} to upload sounds without vetting, add research-related metadata (e.g., identifiability, acoustic analyses, and citations), and create new keywords.|$|R
5000|$|The Global Recordings Network {{worked to}} {{translate}} the biblical messages and songs into every language possible. They trained <b>recordists</b> to choose the most appropriate scripts in order to appeal most to specific groups of people. They had scripts prepared to target many different groups from spirit-worshipers to Muslims or Buddhists. <b>Recordists</b> go into villages and conduct interviews with community members in order to decide which scripts would be most appropriate to gain converts in that area. The final products of the scripts that are recorded appeal to the specific groups of people because the [...] "Spirit" [...] speaks through background noises such as children's voices, bugs, and other sounds that relate to their cultural environment.|$|R
25|$|Sony has {{produced}} albums, {{and ran the}} Shifty Music label at BMG (Africa) {{for two years in}} the mid-1990s. He has also worked as a film sound <b>recordist,</b> sound designer and sound artist.|$|E
25|$|Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family {{are widely}} {{considered}} to be important early country musicians. Their songs were first captured at a historic recording session in Bristol, Tennessee, on August 1, 1927, where Ralph Peer was the talent scout and sound <b>recordist.</b> A scene in the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? depicts a similar occurrence in the same timeframe.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{recorded}} her {{scenes from}} January 6–8, 1996. She {{had a relationship}} with cast member Matthew Perry at the time and an audience member said about their on-screen kiss, [...] "Julia looked at Matt and said 'I'm glad we rehearsed this over the weekend'." [...] A sound <b>recordist</b> commented: [...] "I've seen screen kisses before but this was the best. They really went at it." [...] Roberts thought her appearance on the show was [...] "the most nerve-wracking thing" [...] she had done since auditioning for Pretty Woman. [...] "I wanted to be the best I could be. [...] is incredibly funny, and you want to inspire that same kind of joy that he does. Then at a certain point at lunch, you go, 'Well, it ain't gonna happen. I'll just try to be cute.'" ...|$|E
50|$|The cameras {{themselves}} are generally considered by most sound <b>recordists</b> {{to be quite}} noisy in operation, possibly because the amount of computer processing power, and subsequent generated heat leads to cooling fans being used to keep the camera at a reasonable temperature.|$|R
50|$|In typical {{practice}} for Nagra analogue tape recorders, Alignment Level {{is regarded as}} −8 and maximum level 0. Thus sound <b>recordists</b> using location mixers would typically send a tone at 0 VU or PPM 4 (British) and adjust the Nagra recorder's gain to read −8 on the modulometer.|$|R
50|$|Sherbrooke Forest {{is famous}} for its {{population}} of superb lyrebirds and was an early, and still important, site for the study and conservation of this species. One of the early lyrebird researchers and sound <b>recordists</b> of the 1930s was Raymond Littlejohns. Another researcher who analysed lyrebird song was Konstantin Halafoff.|$|R
500|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, [...] film soundtracks were often bootlegged; if the officially {{released}} soundtrack had been re-recorded with a house orchestra, {{there would be}} demand for the original audio recording taken directly from the film. One example was a bootleg of Judy Garland performing Annie Get Your Gun, before Betty Hutton replaced her early in production, but after a full soundtrack had been recorded. The Recording Industry Association of America took {{a dim view of}} unauthorised releases and attempted several raids on production. The Wagern-Nichols Home <b>Recordist</b> Guild recorded numerous performances at the Metropolitan Opera House, and openly sold them without paying royalties to the writers and performers. The company was sued by the American Broadcasting Company and Columbia Records (who held the official rights to the recordings), who managed to obtain a court injunction against producing the record.|$|E
500|$|Alex Thompson, the episode's sound <b>recordist,</b> {{arranged}} the phones {{so that the}} actors could {{speak to each other}} in real-time. Pemberton and Shearsmith wanted this so that the voices would not have to be recorded in a studio later and added in ADR. The voice of [...] "Chloe"—the identity of whom is key to the story—presented a particular technical challenge, as the writers wanted to ensure that her identity was not revealed the first time her voice is heard. First, the production team recorded Shearsmith playing George-as-Chloe, and then a number of actresses recorded their versions of Shearsmith playing George-as-Chloe. Of these, one—Hall—was chosen to lend her voice to Chloe. Shearsmith then re-recorded his voice, imitating Hall's version of George-as-Chloe. Hall and Shearsmith's respective performances of George-as-Chloe could then be merged together for the final episode. The first time viewers hear [...] "Chloe", her voice is mostly Hall's; as the episode progresses, more of Shearsmith's voice is audible. For Shearsmith, this did not represent the production team cheating the viewers, as viewers' experiences are filtered through Andy's experiences. The first time viewers hear Chloe, they—like Andy—experience her as a teenage girl. As most of the episode was filmed in real-time, George is visible making calls as Chloe, meaning that he hides in plain sight. Footage of Shearsmith playing George-as-Chloe in George's office—used in the final episode—was filmed separately {{to the rest of the}} episode, as a camera set-up in George's office would have been visible on one of the main cameras.|$|E
2500|$|When such [...] "big" [...] {{sounds are}} required, the <b>recordist</b> will begin {{contacting}} professionals or technicians {{in the same}} way a producer may arrange a crew; if the <b>recordist</b> needs an explosion, he may contact a demolition company to see if any buildings are scheduled to be destroyed with explosives in the near future. [...] If the <b>recordist</b> requires a volley of cannon fire, he may contact historical re-enactors or gun enthusiasts.|$|E
50|$|The world's largest {{collection}} of natural sounds is held in the climate-controlled archives of the Lab's Macaulay Library. There are more than 165,000 recordings of birds, bats, whales, insects, frogs, elephants, and other animals. Macaulay Library <b>recordists</b> continue to mount expeditions to collect wildlife sounds and images {{from around the world}} to expand the archive.|$|R

[...] Many sound effects cannot be recorded in a studio, such as explosions, gunfire, and automobile or aircraft maneuvers. [...] These effects must be recorded by a sound effects editor or a professional sound effects <b>recordist.</b>|$|E

2500|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{historical}} documentation and musicological research and analysis of Virgin Islander music. The sound <b>recordist</b> Mary Jane Soule and ethnomusicologist Margot Lieth-Philipp collaborated on an annotated CD, Zoop Zoop Zoop: Traditional Music and Folklore of St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John; these liner notes are among the comprehensive descriptions of folk music known. Lieth-Phillipp has also published some other material, on bamboula (which she refers to as a [...] "forgotten" [...] style of Caribbean music) and other topics. The loca and the Smithsonian Institution have also documented some folk traditions, but their research remains largely unpublished. [...] Carmen Nibbs-O'Garra, wife of well-known Antiguan calypsonian Figgy, {{is the author of}} In de Calypso Tent, which, though perhaps no longer available, contains information of calypso competitions of St. Thomas and also reproduces the lyrics of popular Virgin Islands calypsos, and historical programs from past calypso tents on the islands. While not a scholarly history of the islands' musical life, The Memoirs of Alton Augustus Adams, Sr.: First Black Bandmaster of the United States Navy were recently published by the University of California Press in a scholarly edition by Mark Clague. This book offers a first-hand account of musical life in the Virgin Islands from the 1900s through the 1950s. Adams's remembrances are surprisingly precise as in addition to his musical activities, he worked as a journalist and much of his writing is based upon the articles and notes he penned for The St. Thomas Times and The Bulletin as well as The Pittsburgh Courier.|$|E

40|$|The {{preservation}} of {{historical and contemporary}} data safeguards our scientific legacy. Bioacoustic recordings can have historical as well as scientific value and should be assessed for their conservation requirements. Unpreserved bioacoustics recordings are generally not referenced and are frequently {{at high risk of}} loss by material degradation and/or by misplacement. In this study we investigated the preservation status of sets of natural sound recordings made in Portugal from 1983 until 2010 inclusive. We evaluated the recordings {{on the basis of their}} rate of loss, the degree to which unpreserved recordings could be preserved, and their risk of loss. <b>Recordists</b> of animal sounds were surveyed (by questionnaire or interview) to identify sets of recordings and to collect information on their quality and state of preservation.
