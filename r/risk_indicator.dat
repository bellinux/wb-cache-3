The rankings of the 15 applications by the indicators differed when the score for the environment as a whole was concerned. This was caused by the large variety in environmental compartments taken into account by the indicators. However, for the individual compartments surface water, groundwater and soil the indicators gave similar rankings of the 15 pesticide applications. The ranking based on the indicator ???kilograms of active ingredient??? did not correlate with most of the rankings by the <b>risk</b> <b>indicators.</b> Indicators are regarded as useful tools for the reduction of the environmental impact of pesticides.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{a series of}} principles, similar to those developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in relation to policy oriented indicators, intended to codify best-practice {{with regards to the}} design of pesticide <b>risk</b> <b>indicators</b> for use by farmers. Development of these principles was based upon extensive reviews of the literature concerning the potential exposure to and impacts of pesticides on non-target organisms and the relative merits and limitations of different methodological approaches, discussions with farmers concerning the suitability of different approaches to <b>risk</b> <b>indicators</b> and experimental assessments of indicator performance. These assessments took the form of a three-year field trial examining the impact of different levels of pesticide input upon non-target arthropods and several smaller trials that compared the performance of different insecticides and investigated the effect of differences in pesticide dose on non-target arthropods. The data were then compared with the theoretical results generated by a number of different <b>risk</b> <b>indicators.</b> The thesis also identifies a number of barriers to the implementation of these principles in the form of new pesticide <b>risk</b> <b>indicators.</b> These include restrictions on the range of non-target organisms and potential effects for which high quality data is available and the methodological difficulties associated with the incorporation of sublethal, indirect and ecosystem-level effects into <b>risk</b> <b>indicators.</b> Improvements in the validation of pesticide <b>risk</b> <b>indicators</b> that enable objective evaluations of indicator performance to be made are also required.

50|$|Financial risk is most {{commonly}} {{measured in terms}} of the variance or standard deviation of a variable such as percentage returns or rates of change. In foreign exchange, a relevant factor would be the rate of change of the spot exchange rate between currencies. Variance represents exchange rate risk by the spread of exchange rates, whereas standard deviation represents exchange rate risk by the amount exchange rates deviate, on average, from the mean exchange rate in a probability distribution. A higher standard deviation would signal a greater currency risk. Economists have criticized the accuracy of standard deviation as a <b>risk</b> <b>indicator</b> for its uniform treatment of deviations, be they positive or negative, and for automatically squaring deviation values.

50|$|A {{biomarker}} can be {{a substance}} that is introduced into an organism {{as a means to}} examine organ function or other aspects of health. For example, rubidium chloride is used in isotopic labeling to evaluate perfusion of heart muscle. It can also be a substance whose detection indicates a particular disease state, for example, the presence of an antibody may indicate an infection. More specifically, a biomarker indicates a change in expression or state of a protein that correlates with the risk or progression of a disease, or with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment. Biomarkers can be characteristic biological properties or molecules that can be detected and measured in parts of the body like the blood or tissue. They may indicate either normal or diseased processes in the body. Biomarkers can be specific cells, molecules, or genes, gene products, enzymes, or hormones. Complex organ functions or general characteristic changes in biological structures can also serve as biomarkers. Although the term biomarker is relatively new, biomarkers have been used in pre-clinical research and clinical diagnosis for a considerable time. For example, body temperature is a well-known biomarker for fever. Blood pressure is used to determine the risk of stroke. It is also widely known that cholesterol values are a biomarker and <b>risk</b> <b>indicator</b> for coronary and vascular disease, and that C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker for inflammation.|$|E
50|$|The spatial QRS-T angle (SA) {{is derived}} from a vectorcardiogram, which is a {{three-dimensional}} representation of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) created with a computerized matrix operation. The SA is the angle of deviation between two vectors; the spatial QRS-axis representing all of the electrical forces produced by ventricular depolarization and the spatial T-axis representing all the electrical forces produced by ventricular repolarization. The SA {{is indicative of the}} difference in orientation between the ventricular depolarization and repolarization sequence. In healthy individuals, the direction of ventricular depolarization and repolarization is relatively reversed; this creates a sharp SA. There is high individual variability and gender difference in the magnitude of the SA. The mean, normal SA in healthy young adult females and males is 66° and 80°, respectively, and very similar magnitudes are found in the elderly population (65 years and older). In ECG analysis, the SA is categorized into normal (below 105°), borderline abnormal (105-135°) and abnormal (greater than 135°). A broad SA results when the heart undergoes pathological changes and is reflected in a discordant ECG. A large SA indicates an altered ventricular repolarization sequence, and {{may be the result of}} structural and functional myocardial changes that induce regional shortening in action potential duration and impaired ion channel functioning. Current standard ECG markers of repolarization abnormalities include ST depression, T wave inversion and QT prolongation. Many studies have investigated the prognostic strength of the SA for cardiac morbidity and mortality compared to these and other ECG parameters. In treated hypertensive patients, the SA was significantly larger in patients with elevated blood pressure compared to those with lower blood pressure values and a discrimination between patients with high and low blood pressure could not be detected using other ECG parameters. In the Rotterdam Study with men and women aged 55 years and older, having an abnormal SA significantly increased the hazard ratios for cardiac death, sudden cardiac death, non-fatal cardiac events (infarction, coronary interventions) and total mortality. Independently, the SA was a stronger <b>risk</b> <b>indicator</b> of cardiac mortality compared to the other cardiovascular and ECG risk factors analyzed. The Women’s Health Initiative study concluded that a wide SA was the strongest predictor for incident coronary heart failure risk and a dominant risk factor for all cause mortality compared to several other ECG parameters. The SA also increases accuracy of diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Using only conventional ECG criteria to diagnose LVH the diagnostic accuracy was 57%, however the inclusion of the SA significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy to 79%.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundA basic {{assumption}} was that exposure to the indoor environment would increase the manifestation of respiratory symptoms in predisposed individuals. The aim {{was to investigate the}} proportion of perceived respiratory symptoms attributed to specific environmental exposures, and associations related to indoor climate <b>risk</b> <b>indicators,</b> i. e. occurrence of damp or mould, insufficient ventilation and condensation on windows. MethodA questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 8008 individuals, stratified for gender and age. The response rate was 84 % (n= 6732). Established criteria for current asthma were used to classify subjects into three subgroups: asthmatics, healthy and symptomatics (but without current asthma). ResultsThe proportion of symptoms attributed to specific environmental exposures increased in the total sample and in the three subgroups when indoor climate <b>risk</b> <b>indicators,</b> particularly damp or mould, were reported. Generally, the lowest proportions were found for healthy and the highest for asthmatics. Univariate analyses presented as relative risks (RR) (95 % CI) showed significantly increased risks for perceived overall influence on airways for all groups, with RR ranging from 4. 3 to 6. 8. Although respiratory symptoms attributed to dust, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and strong scents increased when <b>risk</b> <b>indicators</b> were reported, RR were generally lower in all groups. ConclusionThe high frequency of respiratory symptoms among asthmatics increased when occurrences of <b>risk</b> <b>indicators</b> were reported.
