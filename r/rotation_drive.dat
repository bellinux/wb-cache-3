We find that {{large amounts of}} initial <b>rotation</b> <b>drive</b> the system into a phase of strong mass loss while it is moderately contracting. The core is rotating even faster than before although angular momentum is transported outwards. At {{the same time the}} core is heating. Given these features this phase can be associated with the gravo-gyro 'catastrophe' found by Hachisu (1979). The increase in central angular momentum levels off after about 2 - 3 initial half-mass relaxation times indicating that the source of this `catastrophe' is depleted. Finally, the central angular velocity increases again, but with a rather small power of the central density [...] the same power as for the central velocity dispersion during self-similar contraction towards the collapse. The rotation curves flatten and the ellipticity variations decrease with time, but their shapes are very similar. These results suggest the existence of a self-similar solution for a rotating cluster as well. The maximum values of rotational velocity and ellipticity occur at about the half mass radius.

Despite its unusual motility behavior, draft genome sequencing revealed that both the composition and organization of flagellar genes in Paenibacillus sp. were very similar to those in Bacillus subtilis.

But Page 95 {{is at the end of}} a chapter?Microstructures play an important role in controlling distribution of properties in engineering materials. It is possible to develop components with tailored distribution of properties such as strength and stiffness by controlling microstructure evolution during the manufacturing process. When forming metallic components by imposing large deformations, mechanisms such as slip and lattice <b>rotation</b> <b>drive</b> formation of texture in the underlying polycrystalline microstructure. Such microstructural changes affect the final distribution of material properties in the component. By carefully designing the imposed deformation, one could potentially tailor the microstructure and obtain desired property distributions. This thesis focuses on development of novel computational strategies for designing deformation processes to realize materials with desired properties. The techniques presented are an interplay of several new tools developed recently, such as reduced order modeling, graphical cross-plots, statistical learning, microstructure homogenization and multi-scale sensitivity analysis. The primary outcomes of this thesis are listed below: 1. Development of reduced-order representations and graphical methodologies for representing process-property-texture relationships. 2. Development of adaptive reduced-order optimization techniques for identification of processing paths that lead to desirable microstructure-sensitive properties. 3. Development of homogenization techniques for predicting microstructure evolution in large deformation processes. 4. Development of multi-scale sensitivity analysis of poly-crystalline material deformation for optimizing microstructure-sensitive properties during industrial forming processes. The framework for design of polycrystalline microstructures leads to increased product yield in industrial forming processes and simultaneously allows control distribution of properties such as stiffness and strength in forged products. Multi-scale design problems leading to billions of unknowns have been solved using parallel computing techniques. The computational framework can be readily used for selecting optimal processing paths for achieving desired properties. The methodology developed is a fundamental effort at providing detailed deformation process design solutions needed for controlling properties of performance-critical hardware components in automotive, structural and aerospace applications...|$|E
40|$|Aspects of the {{macroscopic}} phenomenology of tokamak plasmas - relaxation, transport, {{and flow}} generation - are analyzed {{in the context}} of phase space dynamics. Particular problems of interest are: i) fluctuation entropy evolution with turbulence driven flows and its application to flow generation by heat flux driven turbulence, and ii) dynamical coupling between phase space structures and zonal flows and its implication for macroscopic relaxation and transport. In chapter 2, intrinsic toroidal <b>rotation</b> <b>drive</b> by heat flux driven turbulence in tokamak is analyzed based on phase space dynamics. In particular, the dynamics of fluctuation entropy with turbulence driven flows is formulated. The entropy budget is utilized to quantify tokamaks as a heat engine system, where heat flux is converted to macroscopic flows. Efficiency of the flow generation process is defined as the ratio of entropy destruction via flow generation to entropy production via heat input. Comparison of the results to experimental scaling is discussed as well. In chapter 3, dynamics of a single phase space structure (drift hole) is discussed for a strongly magnetized 3 D plasma. The drift hole is shown to be dynamically coupled to zonal flows by polarization charge scattering. The coupled dynamics of the drift hole and zonal flow is formulated based on momentum budget. As an application, a bound on the self-bound drift hole potential amplitude is derived. The results show that zonal flow damping appears as a controlling parameter. In chapter 4, dynamics of both a single structure and multi- structures in phase space are discussed for a relevant system, i. e. trapped ion driven ion temperature gradient turbulence. The structures are dynamically coupled to zonal flows, since they must scatter polarization charge to satisfy the quasi-neutrality. The coupled evolution of the structures and flows is formulated as a momentum theorem. An implication for transport process is discussed as well.

The dynamical friction exerted by zonal flow is a novel effect and reduces transport by algebraically competing against other fluxes, such as a quasilinear diffusive flu...|$|E

The upper platform {{is connected to the}} lower one by six movable elements, three of which are rods attached to the bases by means of spherical joints, and another three have a crank structure. The paper shows an approach to the solution of a direct task of kinematics based on mathematical modeling. The inverse problem of kinematics is formulated as follows: at specified angles of <b>rotation</b> <b>drive</b> (the values of generalized coordinates) to determine the position of the top mobile platform. To solve this problem has been used a mathematical model describing the proposed system. On the basis of the constructed model were made the necessary calculations that allowed us using the values of crank angles connected with the engines to determine the position of the platform in space. To solve the problem we used the method of virtual points {{to reduce the number of}} equations and unknowns, which determine the position of the upper platform in space, at a crucial system from eighteen to nine, thus simplifying the solution. To check the solution correctness was carried out numerical experiment. Each generalized coordinate took on values in the range from - 30 ° to 30 °; for them a direct positional problem was solved, and its result was inserted, as initial data, in the previous solved and proven inverse problem on the position of the platform under study. The paper presents comparative results of measurements with the calculated values of the generalized coordinates and draws the appropriate conclusions, that this model is in good compliance with the results observed in practice. One of the distinctive features of the proposed approach is that rotation angles of engines are used as the generalized coordinates. This allowed us to state the possibility to use the constructed model for the further development of control systems based on it.
