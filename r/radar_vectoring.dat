Much {{of the benefit}} to these carriers is envisioned through merging and spacing the arriving and departing traffic to a more manageable flow. More environmentally friendly and efficient area navigation (RNAV) descent profiles, combined with CDTI, may allow crews to eventually aid controllers with assisted visual acquisition of traffic and limited cockpit-based separation of aircraft. The benefits to the carrier are fuel and time efficiencies associated with idle descent and shorter traffic patterns than typical <b>radar</b> <b>vectoring</b> allows.|$|E

50|$|Flight 775 {{took off}} from London-Gatwick bound for Entebbe with an {{intermediate}} stop in Rome. While descending into Rome, the flight crew was given clearance for an ILS approach to runway 16L. Due to poor visibility, a missed approach was carried out. A second approach was attempted to runway 25. This too had to be abandoned due to weather conditions. The crew requested <b>radar</b> <b>vectoring</b> to runway 34L.

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the crew did not discuss {{the details of their}} intended route with Flight Service or activate the instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan forwarded from the airline dispatch to Flight Service. If they had been operating under instrument flight rules they would have been tracked by radar or required to make position reports to air traffic control en route. Under VFR they would only need to maintain contact with a controller while in controlled airspace. In this area of rural Arkansas there was no controlled airspace below 18,000 feet (5,486 m). Further, according to Federal Aviation Regulations the airline dispatcher should have been notified the flight was proceeding under VFR.

40|$|Continuous descent {{operations}} (CDOs) with required {{times of}} arrival (RTAs) {{have been identified}} as a potential solution to reduce fuel consumption and noise nuisance in the ma- neuvering area and without compromising capacity. This paper assesses the feasibility of replacing current air traffic control sequencing and merging techniques (mainly based on <b>radar</b> <b>vectoring)</b> by a control based on RTAs over known and fixed arrival routes, aiming to enable CDOs by ensuring flight management systems have an unerring knowledge about the remaining distance to the runway threshold. The assessment has been performed for Barcelona El Prat airport (Spain), using arrival traffic for several representative days gath- ered from historical data. The earliest and latest trajectories at a metering fix for each inbound aircraft have been computed assuming engine-idle CDOs. Given the attainable RTA window for each aircraft, the feasibility of sequencing the arrival traffic with RTAs has been assessed by solving an aircraft sequencing problem. Results show that low traf- fic scenarios could be properly managed by only assigning RTAs. For certain scenarios, however, with high traffic loads and late RTA assignments, <b>radar</b> <b>vectoring</b> would still be necessary. The distance from the runway where inbound aircraft are expeced to receive the RTA has been also subject of study, demonstrating that the assignment of RTAs well before starting the descent would favor to remove <b>radar</b> <b>vectoring</b> and enable full CDOs.

50|$|A hybrid SID is a {{departure}} that combines {{elements of both}} the pilot-nav and <b>radar</b> <b>vector</b> departures. A hybrid SID usually requires the pilot to fly a set of instructions, then be vectored to a defined route to a transition to leave the terminal area.|$|R

40|$|The task of {{establishing}} properly spaced landing sequences is quite demanding for {{air traffic controllers}} in heavy traffic conditions. Indeed, air traffic controllers combine two or more streams into a single stream before landing by means of <b>radar</b> <b>vectoring</b> and speed instructions. This high level task of sequencing aircraft is not currently communicated to the pilot. Instead, controller translate it into clearances to the pilot, typically <b>radar</b> <b>vectoring</b> and speed instructions. In this paper, the task of merging an aircraft over a specified meter fix is addressed through a novel ‘Set Reference Path ’ procedure in which the air traffic controller may clear an aircraft to merge at a specified meter fix at a given time. This paper focuses on {{the definition of a}} reference path for time-based operations at meter fix. It includes path stretching operations, which occur when the aircraft is predicted to overfly too early a meter fix with respect to other traffic flow constraints. This paper presents a new approach to generate a reference path with length and endpoint constraints based on modified Bezier curves. Compared to reference trajectories based on straight lines and circle arcs, which are usual in the aviation community, the proposed approach allows for smooth control cues and avoids the scheduling between straight lines and circle arcs segments.

40|$|International audienceThe {{delegation}} to the flight crew of some tasks currently performed by air traffic controllers provides new perspectives to potentially increase air traffic control efficiency. More specifically, the task of establishing properly spaced landing sequences is very demanding in heavy traffic conditions for the air traffic controllers {{in charge of the}} terminal manoeuvring area. Automatic merging and station keeping operations could relieve air traffic controller of providing time consuming <b>radar</b> <b>vectoring</b> instructions. The objective of this communication is to provide technical insight into the airborne devices and algorithms which may be used onboard aircraft to automatically achieve a specified distance or delay with respect to another aircraft at a specified meter fix. A nonlinear control law based on sliding mode control is proposed to control the lateral motion of the trailing aircraft. The design is followed by two illustrative examples which show the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the Zagreb Terminal Airspace capacity. The basic {{scenario}} has been modelled using the RAMSPlus simulator and capacity has been calculated by using the WMSE method which {{takes into account the}} peak-hour workload based on air traffic controllers’ tasks. The problem of traffic congestion has been analyzed and several case study scenarios have been simulated. The conducted simulations have demonstrated that in the conditions of increased traffic loads (traffic demand amounting to 6 % annually) the working technology and the airspace organization of Zagreb Terminal Airspace will become a restricting factor at peak-hour workloads. The new technologies in Zagreb Terminal Airspace (P-RNAV routes and airspace sectorization) will enable the reduction in air-traffic controller’s workload regarding <b>radar</b> <b>vectoring,</b> radio-telephony and coordination tasks.

The data for mean separation time between targets at the MAP and the range about that mean were analyzed by appropriate analyses of variance. Significant effects were found for mean separation times {{as a result of the}} configuration of the MLS and for interaction between the configuration and wind conditions.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} a specific aspect of {{air traffic control}} services, namely the achievement of an orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic under time constrained continuous descent approach. More specifically, a futuristic 4 D trajectory application where the air traffic controller will ask an aircraft to overfly a meter fix at a specific time is addressed. The main benefit expected from this application is to improve flight efficiency by more precise maneuvering resulting from on-board capabilities as well as noise abatement and fuel saving. More precise maneuvers are also expected to increase sector capacity. Indeed moving from <b>radar</b> <b>vectoring</b> to monitoring precomputed trajectories would contribute to decrease controller’s workload and therefore to increase sector capacity. This paper presents a new methodology to compute a reference trajectory for time based continuous descent operations and focuses on aircraft longitudinal motion including known wind. As far as time constrained operations are assumed, final {{time as well as}} final altitude and along track distance to be flown are imposed. We propose a new methodology to compute a reference calibrated airspeed (CAS) and a reference vertical speed to achieve imposed final position and altitude at a prescribed time which solve the Two-point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP) where initial and final constraints are coupled with the set of ordinary differential equations associated with the aircraft motion. The aircraft is considered as a point mass model. The optimal control problem consists in minimizing fuel consumption while ensuring that the maximum longitudinal and normal accelerations remain lower than the acceptable level for civil flights. The computed trajectory is a time parametrized trajectory which will be used as a reference trajectory by some envisioned tracking controller installed on board the aircraft. Nevertheless the design of the tracking controller is out of the scope of this paper. Numerical simulations using Bada 3. 11 are provided to illustrate the suboptimal trajectory generation method and achieved results...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} a specific aspect of {{air traffic control}} services, namely the achievement of an orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic under time constrained continuous descent approach. The task of establishing properly spaced landing sequences is quite demanding for air traffic controllers, especially under heavy traffic conditions. Indeed, terminal control area (TMA) air traffic controllers have to merge two or more streams into a single stream by means of <b>radar</b> <b>vectoring</b> and speed instructions. This high level task of sequencing aircraft is not currently communicated to the pilot. In this paper, the task of merging an aircraft over a specified meter fix is addressed through a novel clearance in which air traffic control clears an aircraft to track an ad-hoc computed reference trajectory. This enables the aircraft to merge a specified meter fix at a given time. This kind of application may be envisioned as an enhancement {{of the use of}} the ground based Arrival MANager (AMAN), which is a tactical controller assistance system enabling the computation of rendez-vous time at meter fix to meet the runway capacity and absorb the traffic. The time computed by the AMAN is envisioned to be used by the air traffic controller to request the aircrew to overfly the meter fix at the desired time. In comparison with current operations, the change is that the controller would communicate decisions on traffic flow organization at a higher level to the pilot rather than requiring the controller to calculate and communicate lower-level guidance instructions. While keeping the controller responsible for making the traffic flow decisions, the envisioned application involves new avionics capabilities for merging operations, including the tracking of height and speed. Thus, air traffic control improvement is achieved through a greater involvement of pilots in cooperation with air traffic controllers. This type of application is clearly in the scope of the 4 D trajectory concept promoted by the European programme SESAR and by the US programme NextGen. In this paper a futuristic 4 D trajectory application where the air traffic controller will ask an aircraft to overfly a meter fix at a specific time is addressed. The overflying time is assumed to be specified by the air traffic controller to settle properly the arrival sequence and could be given for example through an Arrival Manager (AMAN). In addition, this clearance is assumed to be given after the Top Of Descent (TOD) of the aircraft. This paper focuses on the issue of computing reference airspeed and height profiles for time constrained descent. The proposed approach is illustrated through some examples...|$|E
5000|$|The {{accident}} investigation board was split in its {{decision as to whether}} the flight crew or Air Traffic Control were responsible. The majority absolved the controllers as the plane was not on a published approach segment. The dissenting opinion was that the flight had been <b>radar</b> <b>vectored.</b> Terminology between pilots and controllers differed without either group being aware of the discrepancy. It was common practice at the time for controllers to release a flight to its own navigation with [...] "Cleared for the approach," [...] and flight crews commonly believed that was also authorization to descend to the altitude at which the final segment of the approach began. No clear indication had been given by controllers to Flight 514 that they were no longer on a <b>radar</b> <b>vector</b> segment and therefore responsible for their own navigation. Procedures were clarified after this accident.

The search and rescue efforts were hampered by rough terrain and adverse weather condition.|$|R
50|$|When an {{aircraft}} is flying under instrument flight rules (IFR), the pilot will often have no visual {{reference to the}} ground, and must therefore rely on internal (e.g. GPS) or external (e.g. VOR) aids in order to navigate. Although in some situations air traffic control may issue <b>radar</b> <b>vectors</b> to direct {{an aircraft}}'s path, this is usually done to facilitate traffic flow, {{and will not be}} the sole means of navigating to an important point, such as the position from which an aircraft commences its approach to landing.|$|R
50|$|Because IFR flights {{often take}} place without visual {{reference}} to the ground, a means of navigation other than looking outside the window is required.

Air traffic control may assist in navigation by assigning pilots specific headings ("radar vectors").
