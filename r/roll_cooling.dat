40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} the mechanism {{of the development of}} abnormal grain sizes in the through-thickness direction of hot rolled steel strips. For this purpose, industrially prepared steel strips were further hot rolled in a laboratory hot rolling mill, setting a variety of rolling parameters. As found, the deformation rate in the hot rolling practice exerts an important role in explaining the mechanism of abnormal grain growth, especially in the close vicinity of the strip surface. Furthermore, the influence of the cooling penetration depth, induced by the roll contact was examined closely, as this phenomenon might support abnormal grain growth mechanisms. Additional information was found in performing a texture analysis in the through-thickness direction of the steel strips, in accordance with the optical metallurgical survey of the microstructures. It will be shown that, the combination of particular hot rolling parameters provokes the occurrence of abnormal grain growth in the through-thickness direction of the ELC steel strips.

40|$|O resfriamento de cilindros é um dos {{important}}es processos dentro da Laminação a Quente, podendo destacar dois fenômenos. O primeiro é a degradação da superfície do cilindro, em que sua durabilidade é influenciada pela temperatura. O segundo é a expansão térmica do cilindro que é crítico tanto para a forma quanto para a tolerânciadimensional do produto. Para que o resfriamento seja eficiente, é preciso que os jatos de água sejam distribuídos uniformemente ao longo do corpo do cilindro e a pressão seja o suficiente para romper o filme de vapor de água, de forma que a água atue diretamente na superfície do cilindro. Determinar os coeficientes e os regimes de transferência de calor durante o resfriamento de cilindros são fundamentais para qualidade do produto laminado. Este trabalho contemplou estudos experimentais e numéricos dos efeitos do resfriamento de um jato de água em formato de leque sobre um cilindro protótipo sob elevadas temperaturas (50 a 350 ºC). As características térmicas foram examinadas em diferentes condições de teste. A análise numérica foi realizada usando o método inverso da condução de calor. Os resultados obtidos contribuíram para um melhor entendimento dos modos de transferência de calor envolvidos durante o resfriamento de cilindros aquecidos a elevadas temperaturas, para melhorar a modelagem e o dimensionamento de sistemas de resfriamento da Laminação a Quente. Os resultados mostraram que a pressão, o tipo de bico usado e o comprimento do leque influenciam na eficiência doresfriamento de cilindros. O valor máximo encontrado para o coeficiente de transferência de calor foi de 6, 0 kW/m 2. °C e apresentou uma diferença de 14, 3 % entre o centro e a extremidade do leque. <b>Roll</b> <b>cooling</b> {{is one of}} {{the important}} processes in the Hot Rolling, can highlight two points. The first is the wear of the roll, where the high temperature influence on its durability in the mill. The second is the thermal expansion of the roll where it is critical to both the shape and dimensional tolerance for the product. For the cooling is done well, it is necessary that the jets of water are conveniently distributed throughout the body and the roll pressure is adjusted according to need, ie, enough to break the film of water vapor, so that water acts directly on the roll body. Therefore, determining the coefficients and the regimes of heat transfer, which occur during the incidence of water jet on the surface at high temperature, are essential for the control system. Throughoutthis paper we present experimental and numerical studies of the effects of cooling water jet fan-shaped on a roll prototype to high temperatures ranging from 50 to 350 ºC. The thermal characteristics were examined by means of cooling curves at different test conditions. The numerical analysis was performed using the inverse heat conduction. The results contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the modes of heat transfer involved during cooling of rolls heated to high temperatures, and to improve the modeling and design of cooling systems for hot rolling.

40|$|The {{high quality}} {{requirements}} of sheet metal (eg steel, aluminium) {{and the modern}} trends towards computer control of sheet rolling have placed an increasing emphasis on {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics of the flat rolling process. The examination of the thermal behaviour of the rolls and rolled product, as the latter is deformed in a rolling stand, is integral to an understanding of rolling. The thermal process occurring in the rolling stands affects the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the material, governs the <b>roll</b> <b>cooling</b> requirements, and influences the overall flatness of the rolled product. This thesis is primarily concerned with the prediction of the short-time variation of the temperature field of the rolls and rolled product, as the latter is deformed in a rolling stand. The effect of an oxide layer, which often exists in hot rolling of steel, on the thermal process has been studied in detail. It is demonstrated that, under normal rolling conditions, the thermal process occurring in rolling can be reduced by perturbation methods to one of heat transfer between three slabs with plane parallel boundary contact. As a result, the reduction in heat loss to the rolls and the increase in temperature of the rolled product due to the insulating effect of the oxide layer can be quantified. The contribution of each heat source term, namely, that arising from the effect of the bulk temperature difference between the roll and rolled product, frictional heating at the roll/rolled product contact region, and deformation heating in the rolled product within the roll gap, to the overall thermal process is estimated for both hot and cold rolling conditions...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. The cooling of working rolls is an important process in the hot rolling technology. The optimal cooling of rolls should be designed with respect to two aspects. The first is the wearing of a roll where high temperature decreases the durability of the surface layer. The second aspect is a thermal deformation of a roll. This is critical for the shape and tolerance of flat products. Cooling at rolling mill should be designed with consideration to both aspects. Finding optimum pressure and flow rate is a difficult task. In regards to water quantity, the experience shows that the phrase “more is better” is not valid here. In other word – {{an increase in the}} amount of water can even cause a decrease in cooling intensity. Water nozzles are typically used in this case. There are many of factors which can influence the efficiency of the nozzle cooling system: Type of a nozzle, geometrical configuration (nozzle pitch, distance from the roll, orientation, number of manifolds), coolant pressure and temperature. Cooling intensity is mostly specified through Heat transfer coefficient (HTC) or heat flux (HF) distribution. Coolant flow on the rotating roll surface makes the problem complex. Surface temperature of the cylinder {{plays an important role in}} the heat transfer mechanism, especially for higher temperatures where boiling must be considered. No analytical or numerical solution of heat transfer and fluid flow for this case is known. The task can be successfully solved experimentally. An experimental bench and methodology of realistic boundary conditions determination was developed in the Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow Laboratory (HEATLAB). The strategy of optimization is based on two steps. First is investigation of present situation of work <b>roll</b> <b>cooling</b> system and second is design of a new system. Criterion of optimization is saving of cooling water with remaining or increasing of cooling intensity. Comparison of the original design and new design was done numerically, using special software and experimentally by temperature measurement of working roll after specified rolling campaign.
