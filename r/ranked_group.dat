50|$|Most of the {{examples}} of ‘sociétés à maison’ cited by Lévi-Strauss, {{with the exception of}} the Kwakiutl Indians of the North-west coast of Canada, were feudal. This has led some to ask if feudalism was an essential feature of House societies, and answering in the negative. Schrauwers, in contrast, has argued that House societies are characteristically organized around a system of social ranks, not feudalism. That is, the House is not an economic class but a socially <b>ranked</b> <b>group</b> (e.g. a nobility) in a society organized around a system of social ranks; while a House may own property, it is thus not tied to a feudal mode of production. Schrauwers gives, as an alternate example, societies organized around slavery where a noble group's property are its slaves (such as the Kwakiutl case).|$|E

40|$|In a {{fallow deer}} {{population}} in south western Sweden was female group size and group composition estimated. A possible rank order between female {{groups and the}} effects of this was also investigated. By using GPS-position from 11 marked females was home range size, preferred habitats and distance to preferred habitats determined and tested for relationship to rank order. Mean female home range size was 2. 92 km 2 and preferred habitats were "Arable land", "Broad-leaved forest not on mire or open bedrock", and "Younger forest". Mean group size in mainly open areas was 72 individuals. Represented by the marked females there was a rank order found between female groups, and each marked female included in the rank study received a unique rank. There was a negative relationship between rank and home range size, the higher rank a female group did possess the smaller home range did it kept. Thus a high <b>ranked</b> <b>group</b> may not need to move over large areas to satisfy its requirements. This would mean less time to search for food and more time to forage and therefore an increased fitness. Further there was also a negative relationship between rank and area of preferred habitat, as high ranked female group kept a smaller area of the preferred habitats "Broad-leaved forest" and "Younger forest". This is related to a small home range that consists of smaller areas of preferred habitat in the same way a large home range consist of larger areas preferred habitat. This will however not mean that the low <b>ranked</b> <b>group</b> that keeps a large home range and large areas of preferred habitat always has access to all preferred habitats. Rather it is probably restricted at certain times by other groups with higher rank to one or several of these preferred areas and thus requires larger areas to alternate between. Finally, mean distance from home range centre to preferred habitat was smaller if the group had a higher rank. This is also related to the fact of a small home range in a high <b>ranked</b> <b>group,</b> where the distance to most habitats is shorter than in large home ranges as for a low <b>ranked</b> <b>group...</b>|$|E

Our <b>ranked</b> <b>group</b> fairness definition extends group fairness using the standard notion of protected groups {{and is based on}} ensuring that the proportion of protected candidates in every prefix of the top-k ranking remains statistically above or indistinguishable from a given minimum. Utility is operationalized in two ways: (i) every candidate included in the top-$k$ should be more qualified than every candidate not included; and (ii) for every pair of candidates in the top-k, the more qualified candidate should be ranked above. An efficient algorithm is presented for producing the Fair Top-k Ranking, and tested experimentally on existing datasets as well as new datasets released with this paper, showing that our approach yields small distortions with respect to rankings that maximize utility without considering fairness criteria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm grounded in statistical tests that can mitigate biases in the representation of an under-represented group along a ranked list.

40|$|Personal {{epistemology}} addresses "the {{theories and}} beliefs that individuals hold about knowledge and knowing {{and the way}} in which such epistemological perspectives are related to academic learning" (Hofer, 2004, p. 120). Hofer and Pintrich (1997) proposed that personal epistemological theories consist of two constructs: the nature of knowledge and the nature of knowing. These constructs are hypothesised to exist on a continuum ranging from naïve to sophisticated epistemological beliefs. Personal epistemology is particularly applicable to medical students in a problem-based-learning (PBL) program, as it emphasises self-directed learning, as "beliefs about knowing and knowledge are potentially important determinants of intellectual performance" (Kuhn, Cheney & Weinstock, 2000, p. 309). There is a paucity of studies in the medical education literature on personal epistemological beliefs (Knight & Mattick, 2006). Roex and Degryse (2007) argue that "insights into students‘ epistemological beliefs have yet to find their way into the curriculum" (p. 616). Savin-Baden (2000) reported that "students‘ voices are largely missing from the literature on problem-based-learning, key elements such as learning context… are rarely acknowledged" (p. 26). The aims of this study was to investigate how personal epistemological beliefs were conceptualised by medical students at the end of their first two years in a PBL medical program; whether their beliefs evolved over the first two years and were related to the process of learning; and whether they differed between students from the lowest and highest ranked academic groups. A qualitative research design framed this investigation. A series of interviews were conducted with 12 second year medical students selected according to a maximum variation purposeful sampling technique (Patton, 2002). The participants represented the highest and lowest academically ranked in their year. Interview transcripts were analysed using a combination of thematic analysis, the constant comparison approach, and a personal epistemological theory framework. The results were presented as thematic narratives constructed on the students‘ retrospective experience of learning over the first two years of medical school. Narratives are well-suited to reporting these qualitative results to "link audience, text, structure, empirical inquiry and lived experience" (Denzin, 1997, p. 244). The findings revealed that students‘ prior learning experiences in high school had a major impact on their epistemological interpretations of the medical program. There was a pattern of epistemological beliefs between the two groups of students. Students from the lowest <b>ranked</b> <b>group</b> retained naïve epistemological beliefs after two years. These students misinterpreted the constructivist curriculum and their approach to learning was disabling. Students from the highest <b>ranked</b> <b>group</b> demonstrated sophisticated beliefs. These students struggled with the transition to the medical program but turned these into opportunities for epistemological development. These results provide an epistemological explanation for why some students struggle, and will continue to struggle, based on their prevailing epistemological beliefs. The findings also suggested that the constructivist PBL approach was a major influence on the development of students‘ epistemological views, and that a constructivist PBL medical program can accelerate students‘ epistemological development.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundRanking of {{hospitals}} by lay media has attracted widespread attention {{but may not}} accurately reflect quality. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality is a straightforward measure of clinical outcome frequently used by ranking algorithms. AimsOur aim was to assess whether ranking among top hospitals correlated with lower in-hospital risk-adjusted mortality following admission for AMI. MethodsUsing a hierarchical regression model and the comprehensive nationwide database of hospital AMI admissions from 2004 to 2007 in France, we analysed crude and risk-adjusted hospital mortality rates in the ranked (‘best’) hospitals versus non-ranked hospitals. We subsequently restricted the comparison to non-ranked hospitals with matching on-site facilities. ResultsWe analysed 192, 372 admissions in 439 hospitals, 43 of which were in the <b>ranked</b> <b>group.</b> Patients admitted to the 396 non-ranked hospitals tended to be older with more comorbidities and underwent fewer revascularization procedures than patients admitted to ranked hospitals. Between hospital differences accounted for 10 % of differences in mortality. Crude mortality was lower in ranked versus non-ranked hospitals (7. 5 % vs. 11. 9 %; P< 0. 001). The survival advantage associated with admission to ranked hospitals was reduced after adjustment for age and sex (5. 7 % vs. 6. 4 %; P= 0. 087) and comorbidities (4. 9 % vs. 5. 5 %; P= 0. 102).

Sieving coefficients of uncharged dextrans of graded size (radii 30 to 60 Å) {{were used to}} characterize barrier size-selectivity in nonazotemic diabetic humans with microalbuminuria (Group 1, N = 11) or macroalbuminuria (Group 2, N = 21). Compared to a non-diabetic control group (N = 21) the low radius end of the sieving profile was depressed, whereas the high radius end was elevated in each diabetic group, more so in Group 2 than Group 1. A heteroporous membrane model revealed the major portion of the glomerular barrier to be perforated by restrictive pores of ∼ 56 Å radius in all three groups. However, in keeping with a parallel trend for GFR, the relative density of restrictive pores was control > Group 1 > Group 2. The remaining minor portion of the barrier was perforated by large, shunt-like pores, the relative prominence of which <b>ranked</b> <b>Group</b> 2 > Group 1 > control. Although the hypothetical, fractional clearance of macromolecule s attributable to the shunt-like pores varied directly with fractional clearances of albumin and IgG, the progressive increment in the latter fractional protein clearances in the two diabetic groups was disproportionate. This {{raises the possibility that}} factors in addition to barrier size defects contribute to the development, magnitude and composition of proteinuria early in the course of diabetic glomerular disease. Such factors could include: (1) a progressive decrement in fractional reab-sorption as the filtered protein load increases, and (2) a concomitant loss of barrier charge-selectivity, permitting albumin but not IgG to escape through restrictive pores, and thereby accounting for an observed excess of albumin over IgG clearance in both micro- and macroalbuminuric stages of diabetic glomerular disease...|$|E

This study {{commenced}} with {{a consideration of the}} measures used in other research, with the purpose of evaluating the relevant provisions {{in the context of the}} elderly population of the Launceston Urban Area. A definition of 'elderly' was sought, based upon the effects and role of aging in our society. By means of a comprehensive review of the literature, the needs of the elderly were examined and three key elements in life satisfaction distinguished - housing, motility and social relationships/activity levels. In addition it was anticipated that spatial differences in the provision of these elements would exist. An interview schedule was designed to elicit information on the provision of the key elements and the factors influencing them at the individual level. Following a broad review of the significance of location among elderly people and their distribution in the Launceston Urban Area, a sample of approximately 5 per cent of the total was selected, locationally stratified but otherwise random. Each element was analysed separately following a review of relevant literature to provide a basis for evaluation of the local circumstances. Thus, each respondent was placed in a <b>ranked</b> <b>group</b> relating to the quality of his/her housing, motility and social relationships/activity levels. In the final chapter the information on the three key elements is combined to provide an index labelled QLP (quality-of-life potential) for each respondent. As the literature and the previous analyses suggested that socio-economic status and aging are major factors in life quality and satisfaction, their impact on the Launceston Urban Area elderly was established. Finally, the factors operating to create disadvantage not explicable in terms of socioeconomic status and aging were examined, and found to relate largely to location in areas of commercial invasion and recent public housing estates. The characteristics of these areas operating negatively on the quality of life of the elderly residents were distinguished through further analysis and interviews...|$|E

The IG stars in the 4 FGs are 0. 3 - 0. 5 Gyr older than in the 8 nonFGs. For the IGL, B-R=~ 1. 4, in good agreement with observations. For FGs/nonFGs the iron abundance of the IG stars is slightly sub-solar in the central parts (r~ 100 kpc) decreasing to about 40 % solar at about 0. 5 r_vir The IG stars are alpha-element enhanced with [O/Fe] increasing with r, and an overall [O/Fe]~ 0. 45, indicating predominant SNII enrichment. The velocity distributions of the IG stars and group galaxies are, at r>~ 30 kpc, significantly more radially anisotropic for FGs than for nonFGs. So a characteristic of FG formation, apart from formation time (D'Onghia et al.), may be the "initial" velocity distribution of the group galaxies. For FGs one can dynamically infer the (dark matter dominated) mass distribution of the groups all the way to r_vir, from the kinematics of the IG stars or group galaxies. For the nonFGs this method overestimates the group mass at r>~ 200 kpc, by up to a factor of two at r_vir. This is interpreted as FGs being, in general, more relaxed than nonFGs. Finally, FGs of the above M_vir should host ~ 500 planetary nebulae at projected distances between 100 and 1000 kpc from the first ranked galaxy. All results appear consistent with the FG formation scenario of D'Onghia et al. Comment: 12 pages, 15 figures, Accepted for MNRAS, Printing in colour recommende...|$|E

It aims to assess {{the extent to which}} the distribution of direct aids of the CAP rewards the supply for environmental public goods by farming. French FADN data are used to analyse the distribution of direct aids received by three farm types: OTEX 15 (cereals and oilseeds), OTEX 45 (milk farms) and OTEX 46 (cattle farms), which represent 44 % of French farms and 50 % of the direct payments in the FADN sample. Eleven indicators of farm pressure on the environment available in the FADN are used to rank farms according to their overall environmental impact. They include the share of grassland, the share of protein crops, or the share of irrigated land in total agricultural area, an index of crop diversity, and information on input costs. The ranking is made in several steps: 1) ranking by indicator: points are attributed to each farm according to its rank in its type of farm decile; 2) for each farm, the points attributed for each indicator are summed; 3) farms are finally ranked in quartiles calculated according to the sum of points, by type of farm. Farms ranked as more environmentally friendly have, on average, larger agricultural area and smaller arable land area, but with higher diversity of crops, and incomes equivalent to those in other farms. For cattle breeding, the best <b>ranked</b> <b>group</b> has fewer cows, and uses more grass and less silage. The income of more environmentally friendly farms is on average less variable over time. During the period 2000 - 13, these farms received lower payments than less environmentally friendly farm categories, but the distribution of payments is changing as the CAP reforms are implemented. Direct payments per hectare are always higher in the farm group with the lowest marks. The difference is not very important for crop farms, but it is large in dairy farming and cattle farming, where the most environmentally friendly farming group receives much lower first pillar payments. They receive higher second pillar payments, but not enough to compensate the difference in first pillar payments. Initial results on UK and German dairy farms point to larger changes in payment distribution over time, mainly due to the regional approach to allocating direct payment from Pillar I among farms...|$|E
