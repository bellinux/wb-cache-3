25|$|Gemini was {{equipped}} with an Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS), containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes (forward/backward, left/right, up/down), in addition to attitude control (pitch, yaw, and <b>roll</b> <b>angle</b> orientation) as in Mercury. Translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude, necessary to perform space rendezvous with other craft, and docking with the Agena Target Vehicle (ATV), with its own rocket engine {{which could be used}} to perform greater orbit changes.|$|E
25|$|In June 1905 the NTC finally {{approved}} Skvortsov's {{proposal to}} decrease deck armor, saving 130 tonnes of gross weight. This {{was only a}} prelude to a major redesign of the ships's protection scheme. In August 1905 Krylov and Skvortsov independently raised concerns about the ship's stability in combat. Skvortsov wrote that although the maximum <b>roll</b> <b>angle</b> was set at a respectable 30°, combat damage would reduce it to an unacceptably low 15°. The only solution, he wrote, was to extend belt armor upward, effectively armoring the whole freeboard surface. Skvortsov compensated the added weight with the removal of two 8-inch gun turrets and yet another redesign of the remaining turrets. The NTC, scared by the losses at Tsushima, approved the proposal. They were not yet aware {{of the effectiveness of}} counter-flooding system of the Borodino-class battleships. Counter-flooding enabled survival of Oryol but her crewmen were still held prisoners in Japan. Their experience materialized in a counter-flooding system designed by Skvortsov in the summer of 1906.|$|E

The recognition rate is drastically decreasing with the images captured in uncontrolled environment having pose variations in yaw, pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>angles.</b> When the face image with frontal pose it is proved that the recognition system performs well.

By estimating the change in pose with respect to yaw, pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>angles</b> based on the landmark points best viewed side of the pose is identified. Using tilting, stretching and mirroring operation to the best viewed side, frontal pose is obtained. This approach is database independent, training free and no need to generate 3 D model and not using any fitting approach, which is a complex task and handle any combination of <b>roll,</b> yaw, pitch <b>angle</b> up to ± 22. 5 degrees only from the 2 D landmark points.

40|$|Landing is a {{dangerous}} and complex phase of any flight. Landing on an airless, dusty world presents unique challenges to perception, including dust blowback. During crewed lunar landings, astronauts will either be directly piloting the lander or supervising the automation in the event {{they need to take}} over piloting duties. An accurate perception of vehicle attitude is critical if the astronaut is to bring the craft down safely. We aim to study human perception of orientation under different visual cues using a helicopter simulator. We conducted a simulator-only lunar landing experiment with seventeen helicopter pilot subjects at USAARL utilizing the 6 degree-of-freedom moving-base UH- 60 helicopter simulator. The subjects did not fly the simulator but continuously indicated his/her perceived pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>angles</b> throughout each trial by keeping a modified joystick aligned with Earth vertical, and the accuracy of the responses has been analyzed to determine the effect of visual cue on attitude perception. The subjects experienced recorded trajectories under five different visual conditions: no visual cues, out-the-window cues with no, medium, and high dust, and instrument cues. Regression models were fit to the correlations between the Subjects' indicated perceived pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>angles</b> and the simulator model pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>angles.</b> It was found that the no vision cue severely hindered the subjects' ability to accurately perceive craft attitude, while the instrument cue enhanced it. The effect of the different levels of dust, as compared to out-the-window no dust condition and the instrument conditions were not statistically significant, though they were better than no vision. by Stephanie E.
