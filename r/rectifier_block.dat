40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to model a typical Aircraft Generator along with its control system and study the {{behaviour}} / performance during fault, particularly in the <b>rectifier</b> <b>block</b> which is used in the field circuit and fault in the winding. The study shows that there is no considerable change in the Generator supply characteristic up to a certain extent of fault, but the significant change in the field excitation was observed. The output of the developed model was successfully corroborated with the MIL-STD 704 F power supply characteristics. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of fully integrated rectifiers in BiCMOS and standard CMOS technologies for rectifying an externally generated RF carrier signal in inductively powered wireless devices, such as biomedical implants, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, and smart-cards to generate an on-chip dc supply. Various full-wave rectifier topologies and low-power circuit design techniques are employed to decrease substrate leakage current and parasitic components, reduce the possibility of latch-up, and improve power transmission efficiency and high-frequency performance of the <b>rectifier</b> <b>block.</b> These circuits are used in wireless neural stimulating microsys-tems, fabricated in two processes: the University of Michigan’s 3 - m 1 M/ 2 P N-epi BiCMOS, and the AMI 1. 5 - m 2 M/ 2 P N-well standard CMOS. The rectifier areas are 0. 12 – 0. 48 mm 2 in the above processes and {{they are capable of}} delivering 25 mW from a receiver coil to the implant circuitry. The performance of these integrated rectifiers has been tested and compared, using carrier signals in 0. 1 – 10 -MHz range.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the high blocking {{capability of the}} 4 H-SiC tungsten Schottky and junction barrier Schottky (JBS) diodes at room temperature {{as well as at}} high operating temperature. First, we present the design of the proposed devices and the process employed for their fabrication. In a second part, their forward and reverse characteristics at room temperature will be presented. Our <b>rectifiers</b> exhibit <b>blocking</b> capability up to 9 kV at room temperature. Then, we investigate the reverse current behaviour at 5 kV from room temperature to 250 °C under vacuum. JBS and Schottky devices that are capable to block 8 kV at room temperature, show leakage current inferior to 100 μA at 250 °C when reverse biased at 5 kV. It confirms the capability of Silicon Carbide to produce devices capable of operation at temperatures and voltages above the Silicon limits. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R
40|$|Slow action {{potentials}} were evoked in twitch fibres of rat extensor digitorum longus (e. d. l.) and soleus muscles after drastically {{reducing the}} Cl and K conductances {{of the muscle}} fibres. Cl conductance was eliminated by exposing the muscles to a Cl-free saline in which methanesulphonate replaced Cl. K conductance was reduced by adding tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 3, 4 -diaminopyridine (3, 4 -DAP) to the Cl-free saline or by overnight incubation of the muscles in a saline containing Cs and TEA. The delayed <b>rectifier</b> was markedly <b>blocked</b> by TEA and 3, 4 -DAP. In contrast, the inward <b>rectifier</b> was <b>blocked</b> only by TEA. Depolarization with pulses of increasing amplitude triggered slow responses which had a threshold of - 30 to - 10 mV and a peak amplitude of 50 - 60 mV. In e. d. l. muscles {{the time course of}} the response was sustained {{for the duration of the}} pulses and was not affected by repeated stimulation. In soleus muscles the first evoked response was sustained in about 60 % of the fibres and transient in the rest. Transient responses reached a peak amplitude and were followed by a hyperpolarization. Repeated stimulation irreversibly transformed the sustained responses of soleus fibres into transient ones. The responses were blocked when the Ca in saline was replaced by Mg (10 mM) or Co (5 mM) or by the addition of Cd (0. 1 - 1. 0 mM) or nifedipine (5 - 6 microM). Tetrodotoxin did not affect the responses. These results strongly suggest that Ca is the main carrier of current during the response. Nifedipine blocked both the Ca response and the subsequent hyperpolarization, suggesting that the latter is due to the activation of a Ca-dependent K conductance...|$|R

50|$|This voltage is not {{directly}} produced by the main power supply circuitry; instead the receiver makes use of the circuitry used for horizontal scanning. Direct current (DC), is switched though the line output transformer, and alternating current (AC) is induced into the scan coils. At {{the end of each}} horizontal scan line the magnetic field, which has built up in both transformer and scan coils by the current, is a source of latent electromagnetic energy. This stored collapsing magnetic field energy can be captured. The reverse flow, short duration, (about 10% of the line scan time) current from both the line output transformer and the horizontal scan coil is discharged again into the primary winding of the flyback transformer by the use of a <b>rectifier</b> which <b>blocks</b> this negative reverse emf. A small value capacitor is connected across the scan switching device. This tunes the circuit inductances to resonate at a much higher frequency. This slows down (lengthens) the flyback time from the extremely rapid decay rate that would result if they were electrically isolated during this short period. One of the secondary windings on the flyback transformer then feeds this brief high voltage pulse to a Cockcroft-Walton generator design voltage multiplier. This produces the required EHT supply. A flyback converter is a power supply circuit operating on similar principles.|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{the effect of the}} {{morphology}} on the optical and electrical properties of the TPyP thin films deposited by vacuum evaporation on different substrates (Si with different characteristics, ITO, quartz and glass). The presence of some well-defined B and Q absorption bands has been evidenced. FTIR and photoluminescence measurements have been used to confirm the preservation of the chemical structure of the compound during the evaporation process. The contact Au/TPyP/Si(n) is <b>rectifier,</b> while a <b>blocking</b> behavior has been shown by Si(n) /TPyP/Si(n) and ITO/TPyP/Si(n) and an injector dominated behavior by Si(p) /TPyP/Si(p) and ITO/TPyP/Si(p) heterostructures. The best transmission was obtained on TPyP film deposited on ITO and the highest value of the current in heterostructures Si(n) electrode characterised by a large grain morphology and in consequence by a weak optical and charge carrier scattering at the grain boundaries...|$|R
40|$|In {{the heart}} cells, rapid delayed {{rectifier}} K+current {{is one of}} the important currents for action potential repolarization phase. Rapid delayed <b>rectifier</b> K+current is <b>blocked</b> by low concentration of E- 4031. The aim of this research was to compare the effect of E- 4031 blocker on pacemaker activity of sinoatrial node (SAN) and atrioventricular node (AVN) of mouse heart. Materials & methodes: The pacemaker activity of distinct intact SAN and AVN by two separate metal microelectrodes that contact the endothelial surface of nodes, was recorded before and during 1 M E- 4031 and cycle length (CL) was measured. Findings: 1 M E- 4031 increased CL on SAN preparations by 67. 6 ± 12. 5 % and on AVN preparations by 28 ± 3. 5 %. These changes were significants in two nodes. Conclusion: It is passible to conclude that 1) the rapid delayed rectifier K+current was present in two nodes 2) the effect of E- 4031 on CL of two nodes was differe...|$|R
40|$|To {{obtain a}} clearer {{understanding}} of the mechanisms by which somatostatin modulates stimulus-secretion coupling in neuroendocrine cells, we investigated the pharmacology of the somatostatin-activated inward rectifier in mouse pituitary tumour cells (AtT- 20 corticotrophs). Individual AtT- 20 cells displayed spontaneous, long-lasting action potentials that caused transient spikes in cytosolic [Ca 2 +] ([Ca]i). Application of 1 - 10 nM somatostatin led to membrane hyperpolarization and loss of [Ca]i spiking activity. Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that the somatostatin-induced hyperpolarization was due to an inwardly rectifying K+ current. Tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) inhibited both outward and inward currents through the inward <b>rectifier,</b> whereas Cs+ <b>blocked</b> only inward current and tetraethylammonium (TEA+) was completely ineffective in blocking somatostatin-activated currents. However TEA+, but neither TBA+ nor Cs+, blocked voltage-gated outward currents. Correspondingly, TBA+ abolished the hyperpolarizing effects of somatostatin and, of the three K+ channel blockers, only TBA+ prevented the somatostatin-induced inhibition of [Ca]i spiking. TBA+ may thus prove a useful tool in elucidating the underlying mechanisms by which somatostatin affects the secretory activity of neuroendocrine cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Myoblast fusion is {{essential}} to skeletal muscle development and repair. We have demonstrated previously that human myoblasts hyperpolarize, before fusion, through the sequential expression of two K � channels: an ether-à-go-go and an inward rectifier. This hyperpolarization {{is a prerequisite for}} fusion, as it sets the resting membrane potential in a range at which Ca 2 � can enter myoblasts and thereby trigger fusion via a window current through � 1 H T channels. This work was undertaken to elucidate the molecular identity of the inward rectifier (Kir) channel involved in fusion. Using RNase protection assays, we detected mRNA for Kir 2. 1 and Kir 2. 2. Transcript levels for both Kir candidates increased during myoblast differentiation. Single-channel recordings of undifferentiated myoblasts overexpressing Kir 2. 1 or Kir 2. 2 indicated that only the conductance of Kir 2. 1 corresponds to that of the endogenous channel. Inhibition of Kir 2. 1 expression with an antisense-Kir 2. 1 -RNA expressed from transfected vector drastically reduced the endogenous inward <b>rectifier</b> current and <b>blocked</b> fusion. In contrast, an antisense-Kir 2. 2 -RNA had no effect on fusion. Taken together, our results demonstrate that functional Kir 2. 1 channels are required for human myoblast fusion. Key words: potassium current • membrane potential • myoblast fusion • muscle • antisens...|$|R
40|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem for}} Aircraft Manufacturers {{has been the}} difficulty in carrying out accurate and robust simulations of the complete aircraft power network, while including numerous models {{from a variety of}} individual equipment suppliers. Often the models are of variable or low quality, with ill-defined parameters or behavior, and in many cases of the wrong level of abstraction to be appropriate for large scale network simulations. In addition, individual equipment suppliers often provide poor models for network integration, with a common issue being low robustness of models leading to lack of convergence, excessive simulation times and delays in development due to the need for rework and extensive testing of these models. In order to address this specific issue a complete library of power electronic system models for Aerospace applications has been developed that encompasses the range of functions from elementary components (passives, devices, switches and magnetic components), intermediate building <b>blocks</b> (<b>rectifiers,</b> inverters, motors, protection devices) and finally complete system models (variable frequency starter generators, power converters, battery and storage elements, transformers). These models have been developed in partnership with several key aircraft equipment suppliers and in partnership with Airbus to ensure that the resulting models are complete and robust. Specific equipment models were also developed in this library including permanent magnet generators, synchronous machines, environmental control systems, wing ice protection systems, power electronic modules and advanced power protection systems. The specific models have been validated against reference and measured data to ensure that they are consistent and accurate. This paper will describe the techniques used to achieve more robust models, using model based engineering, the integration of specific equipment models into the complete aircraft network and the validation of the behavior against measured results. The paper will provide the results of a complete aircraft power network highlighting how the individual models are integrated into the overall network model and the inherent robustness ensure effective, accurate and robust simulations...|$|R
