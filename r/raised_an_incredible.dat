50|$|Keegan partnered up with Operation Smile in 2013 {{after hearing}} a talk done by David Grier, the South African adventurer {{who ran the}} Great Wall of China. David shared the story about kids whose parent couldn't pay for their children's cleft lip and palate {{surgeries}} and the complications they would encounter in their lives. The pictures on the slide show touched Keegan deeply and after the talk {{he walked up to}} David and asked to be involved. Since that day, The Cape Trek Project and Keegan have <b>raised</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> amount of money for the organization. Costing just R5 500 to not only repair a child's palate and lip but also their life, gives these people another chance at life. Keegan has always maintained {{that it would have been}} impossible to do the things he had done if he had a deformity like this and has committed to helping others..|$|E
5000|$|In 1970 Zemaitis started {{experimenting with}} placing a metal shield {{on the top}} of the guitar in order to {{eliminate}} microphonic noise picked up by the guitars' pickups. His first metal top guitar prototype was purchased by Tony McPhee, while the second was for Ronnie Wood of Rolling Stones fame (he was in the Faces at the time). Wood played the instrument on The Faces' Top of the Pops appearance in 1971, and the shiny appearance of the guitar <b>raised</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> amount of interest from guitar players. Zemaitis asked gun engraver Danny O'Brien to do artistic engravings on the metal top and other metal parts, and started building custom-order guitars for the rich and famous. His most famous guitars are Ronnie Wood's 24-fret metal top guitars (a total of four guitars were built for Wood), which he used from 1971 until 1995, Ronnie Wood's [...] "Desert Island" [...] (or [...] "Slide on This") metal disc top guitar, Keith Richards' 5-string [...] "Skull&Bones" [...] guitar, Eric Clapton's [...] "Ivan the Terrible" [...] 12-string acoustic guitar, various acoustics and resonators for George Harrison and basses and resonator for Ronnie Lane. Aside from metal top guitars, from the mid-70s Zemaitis also started decorating the tops of his guitars with elaborate pearl inlay, either figures like dragons and skulls and bones, or complete mosaic-like inlaid tops. These guitars command the highest prices.|$|E
40|$|Serum {{proteome}} {{investigations have}} <b>raised</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> {{interest in the}} research of novel molecular biomarker, nevertheless few of the proposed evidences have been translated to the clinical practice. One of the limiting factors has been the lack of generally accepted guidelines for clinical proteomics studies {{and the lack of}} a robust analytical and pre-analytical ground for the proposed classification models. Pre-analytical issues may results in a deep impact for biomarker discovery campaign. In this study we present a systematic evaluation of sample storage and sampling conditions for clinical proteomics investigations. We have developed and validated a linear MALDI-TOF-MS protein profiling method to explore the low protein molecular weight region (5 - 20 kDa) of serum samples. Data normalization and processing was performed using optimise peak detection routine (LIMPIC) able to describe each group under investigation. Data were acquired either from healthy volunteers and from multiple sclerosis patients in order to highlight ex vivo protein profile alteration related to different physio-pathological conditions. Our data showed critical conditions for serum protein profiles depending on storage times and temperatures: 23 degrees C, 4 degrees C, - 20 degrees C and - 80 degrees C. We demonstrated that upon a - 20 degrees C short term storage, characteristic degradation profiles are associated with different clinical groups. Protein signals were further identified after preparative HPLC separation by peptide sequencing on a nanoLC-Q-TOF TANDEM mass spectrometer. Apolipoprotein A-IV and complement C 3 protein fragments, transthyretin and the oxidized isoforms in different apolipoprotein species represent the major molecular features of such a degradation pattern. status: publishe...|$|E
