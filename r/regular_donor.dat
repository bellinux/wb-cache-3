40|$|International audienceAbstract AIM: Blood donor {{retention}} {{represents a}} fundamental objective in public health. Comparison between the sociodemographic characteristics and motivational factors between lapsed and <b>regular</b> <b>donors</b> is then required. The objectives {{of this analysis}} were: (1) to compare the sociodemographic characteristics of lapsed donors and current donors; (2) to compare the motivations to donate blood expressed by lapsed and current donors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from a 2008 survey, representative of the population by crossed quotas method, of 1400 individuals questioned by phone were used to reach these objectives. Chi(2) tests and binary logistic regressions were used. RESULTS: Results show that socio-occupational categories and motivational factors are different between lapsed and <b>regular</b> <b>donors.</b> Workers, senior management and higher intellectual professions are more often lapsed than <b>regular</b> <b>donors.</b> Concerning motivations, results show that lapsed donors more frequently mention the first experience with blood donation (with colleagues, friends, and parents) than <b>regular</b> <b>donors,</b> for whom altruistic and community motivations are more frequently cited. CONCLUSION: Workers, senior management and higher intellectual professions should be targeted uppermost, in order to convert them in <b>regular</b> <b>donors.</b> Finally, concerning motivations, the social pressure applied to lapsed donors for their first blood donation appears crucial, whereas <b>regular</b> <b>donors</b> have internalized their motives, more often altruistic and community motivations...|$|R

In this survey, the seroprevalence of blood-borne infections among regular, sporadic (lapsed) and first-time blood donors of Bushehr city were determined. Methods: In a retrospective study, the prevalence of transfusion transmitted infections was surveyed among all donors of Bushehr city (20294 persons) during March 2006 to February 2007 and infections markers for hepatitis B and C, HIV AIDS and syphilis were surveyed through screening and confirmatory tests. Results: Among 20294 who donated blood through one year in Bushehr province, 8513 were <b>regular</b> <b>donors</b> (41. 94 %), 2523 sporadic donors (12. 43 %), 9258 first-time donors (45. 61 %) and 495 (2. 40 %) persons were determined as self-exclusion. Of these donors, 48 (0. 23 %) were HBsAg positive, 42 (0. 20 %) HCV-Ab reactive, and all were negative for HIV-Ab and syphilis. We found only 0. 04 % HBsAg positive among <b>regular</b> <b>donors.</b> Conclusions: Blood borne infections among <b>regular</b> blood <b>donors</b> were much less than non <b>regular</b> <b>donors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background The aim was {{to assess}} iron status and dietary iron intake {{in a sample of}} premenopausal female regular and new blood donors. Study design and methods Premenopausal women blood donors were invited to participate. Blood samples were {{analyzed}} for serum ferritin and hemoglobin.  An iron checklist assessed dietary iron intake.  Donors were classified as <b>regular</b> <b>donors</b> or new donors. Results Twenty-one new donors (mean [SD] age,  28. 6 [6. 0] years; body mass index [BMI], 25. 6 [4. 5] kg/m 2) and 172 <b>regular</b> <b>donors</b> (mean age, 29. 4 [5. 5] years; BMI, 24. 7 [3. 8] kg/m 2) participated. Fifty percent of <b>regular</b> <b>donors</b> and 24 % of new donors had depleted iron stores (serum ferritin < 15 mg/L; difference p = 0. 036). Dietary iron intake was higher in regular donors (mean [SE], 12. 6 [0. 7] mg/day) compared to new donors (9. 9 [0. 4] mg/day; p = 0. 006). Eighty-five percent of <b>regular</b> <b>donors</b> and 79 % of new donors met the estimated average requirement for iron. Conclusions Despite {{the fact that most of}} these donors had an adequate dietary iron intake, more than half of the blood donors had depleted iron stores.  Increasing dietary iron intake through supplements and/or dietary means is expected to be necessary to maintain adequate iron status in this group...|$|R

40|$|Background Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MetS), {{a clinical}} condition characterized by insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity, {{has been linked}} with raised levels of serum ferritin (Sfr) concentrations. Objectives This study was carried out to compare hemoglobin (Hb) and Sfr concentrations in patients with MetS, <b>regular</b> <b>donors</b> and first-time donors. Materials and Methods A total of 102 subjects who were between 18 and 60 years were enrolled for the study. They were divided into three groups. The first group (n = 20) {{was made up of}} 5 males and 15 females, all who met the criteria that define MetS. The second group (n = 52; M = 34, F = 18) were <b>regular</b> <b>donors,</b> while the last group (n = 30; M = 16, F = 14) were first-time donors or those who had not donated before. Following an overnight fast, 20 mL of venous blood was drawn from each subject. About 5 mL of this was put into sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) specimen bottles for the full blood count parameters with Sysmex KX- 21 N hematology analyzer (made in Japan). The remaining 15 mL had serum separated for Sfr assay using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a commercial assay kit manufactured by Teco Diagnostics. Results Significant difference was found in the mean Sfr concentration of subjects with MetS (163 ± 136. 92 ng/mL) and <b>regular</b> <b>donors</b> (41. 46 ± 40. 33 ng/mL), P = 0. 001. The mean Sfr concentrations of subjects with MetS (163 ± 136. 92 ng/mL) were also higher than that of first-time donors (102. 46 ± 80. 26 ng/mL), but it was not statistically significant, P = 0. 053. The Hb concentrations of the three groups were not significantly different. Conclusion Sfr concentrations of <b>regular</b> <b>donors</b> were lower than that of subjects with MetS and first-time donors. The difference between <b>regular</b> <b>donors</b> and subjects with MetS was statistically significant. However, there is {{no significant difference in the}} Hb concentrations in the three groups.

50|$|Risks {{are also}} {{associated}} with a <b>regular</b> <b>donor</b> testing positive for HIV, which can have major implications as the donor's last donation could have been given within the window period for testing and could have entered the blood supply, potentially infecting blood product recipients. An incident in 2003 in New Zealand saw a <b>regular</b> <b>donor</b> testing positive for HIV and subsequently all blood products made with the donor's last blood donation had to be recalled. This included NZ$4 million worth of Factor VIII, a blood clotting factor used to treat haemophiliacs which is manufactured from large pools of donated plasma, and subsequently led to a nationwide shortage of Factor VIII and the deferral of non-emergency surgery on haemophiliac patients, costing the health sector millions of dollars more.

40|$|Background. There is {{paucity of}} {{information}} on the effect of blood donation on iron stores in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. The present study was, therefore, designed to assess, using a combination of haemoglobin and iron status parameters, the development of anaemia and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia in this area of Nigeria. Materials and Methods. Three hundred and forty-eight unselected consecutive whole blood <b>donors,</b> comprising 96 <b>regular</b> <b>donors,</b> 156 relatives of patients and 96 voluntary donors, constituted the study population. Three haematological parameters (haemoglobin, packed cell volume, and mean cell haemoglobin concentration) and four biochemical iron parameters (serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation) were assessed using standard colorimetric and ELISA techniques. Results. The prevalence of anaemia alone (haemoglobin < 11. 0 g/dL) was 13. 7 %. The prevalence of isolated iron deficiency (serum ferritin < 12 ng/mL) was 20. 6 % while that of iron-deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin < 11. 0 g/dL + serum ferritin < 12. 0 ng/mL) was 12. 0 %. Among the three categories of the <b>donors,</b> the <b>regular</b> <b>donors</b> were found to be most adversely affected as shown by the reduction in mean values of both haematological and biochemical iron parameters. Interestingly, anaemia, iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anaemia were present almost exclusively among <b>regular</b> blood <b>donors,</b> all of whom were over 35 years old. Conclusion. Anaemia, iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anaemia are highly prevalent among blood donors in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. It will be necessary to review the screening tests for the selection of blood donors and also include serum ferritin measurement for the routine assessment of blood <b>donors,</b> especially among <b>regular</b> blood <b>donors...</b>|$|R
