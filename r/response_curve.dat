5|$|The {{affinity}} of an antagonist for its {{binding site}} (Ki), i.e. {{its ability to}} bind to a receptor, will determine the duration of inhibition of agonist activity. The affinity of an antagonist can be determined experimentally using Schild regression or for competitive antagonists in radioligand binding studies using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Schild regression {{can be used to}} determine the nature of antagonism as beginning either competitive or non-competitive and Ki determination is independent of the affinity, efficacy or concentration of the agonist used. However, it is important that equilibrium has been reached. The effects of receptor desensitization on reaching equilibrium must also be taken into account. The affinity constant of antagonists exhibiting two or more effects, such as in competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents that also block ion channels as well as antagonising agonist binding, cannot be analyzed using Schild regression. Schild regression involves comparing the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC50 of an agonist alone compared to the EC50 {{in the presence of a}} competitive antagonist as determined on a dose <b>response</b> <b>curve.</b> Altering the amount of antagonist used in the assay can alter the dose ratio. In Schild regression, a plot is made of the log (dose ratio-1) versus the log concentration of antagonist for a range of antagonist concentrations. The affinity or Ki is where the line cuts the x-axis on the regression plot. Whereas, with Schild regression, antagonist concentration is varied in experiments used to derive Ki values from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, agonist concentrations are varied. Affinity for competitive agonists and antagonists is related by the Cheng-Prusoff factor used to calculate the Ki (affinity constant for an antagonist) from the shift in IC50 that occurs during competitive inhibition. The Cheng-Prusoff factor takes into account the effect of altering agonist concentration and agonist affinity for the receptor on inhibition produced by competitive antagonists.|$|E
25|$|When {{either side}} of the {{transformer}} is a tuned circuit, the amount of mutual inductance between the two windings, together with the Q factor of the circuit, determine the shape of the frequency <b>response</b> <b>curve.</b> The tuned circuit together with the transformer load form an RLC circuit with a definite peak in the frequency response. When both sides of the transformer are tuned, it is described as double-tuned. The coupling of double-tuned circuits is described as loose-, critical-, or over-coupled depending on the value of k. When two tuned circuits are loosely coupled through mutual inductance, the bandwidth will be narrow. As the amount of mutual inductance increases, the bandwidth continues to grow. When the mutual inductance is increased beyond a critical point, the peak in the <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> begins to drop, and the center frequency will be attenuated more strongly than its direct sidebands. This is known as overcoupling.|$|E
25|$|Many {{electric}} motors and dry type power transformers incorporate PTC thermistors in their windings. When {{used in conjunction}} with a monitoring relay they provide overtemperature protection to prevent insulation damage. The equipment manufacturer selects a thermistor with a highly non-linear <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> where resistance increases dramatically at the maximum allowable winding temperature, causing the relay to operate.|$|E

25|$|The European Union (EU) uses {{a linear}} dose <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> at low-levels of exposure, below {{the point where}} there are {{epidemiological}} data. In other words, the EU assumes there is no safe level of dioxins and PCBs. Accordingly, the European Union sets extremely stringent limits for dioxin and dioxin like PCBs in food, set just above the usual background levels found in various food categories e.g. fish, poultry, beef, pork etc. The limit set for dioxins in pork fat and meat is 1 pg/g TEQ i.e. 1 parts per trillion (ppt) (see swimming pool illustration). The maximum dioxin contamination measured in Irish pork was 0.2 ng/g TEQ fat (200 ppt), equivalent to dispersing 10 drops of TCDD throughout a 2.5 million litre Olympic sized swimming pool.|$|E
25|$|One {{treatment}} {{strategy is}} light therapy (phototherapy), {{with either a}} full-spectrum lamp providing 10,000 lux at a specified distance from the eyes or a wearable LED device providing 350–550 lux at a shorter distance. Sunlight can also be used. The light is typically timed for 30–90 minutes at the patient's usual time of spontaneous awakening, or shortly before (but not long before), which is {{in accordance with the}} phase <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> (PRC) for light. Only experimentation, preferably with specialist help, will show how great an advance is possible and comfortable. For maintenance, some patients must continue the treatment indefinitely; some may reduce the daily treatment to 15 minutes; others may use the lamp, for example, just a few days a week or just every third week. Whether the treatment is successful is highly individual. Light therapy generally requires adding some extra time to the patient's morning routine. Patients with a family history of macular degeneration are advised to consult with an eye doctor. The use of exogenous melatonin administration (see below) in conjunction with light therapy is common.|$|E

500|$|Traditionally {{reversible}} {{enzyme inhibitors}} have been classified as competitive, uncompetitive, or non-competitive, {{according to their}} effects on Km and Vmax. These different effects result from the inhibitor binding to the enzyme E, to the enzyme–substrate complex ES, or to both, respectively. [...] The division of these classes arises from a problem in their derivation and results in the need to use two different binding constants for one binding event. [...] The binding of an inhibitor {{and its effect on}} the enzymatic activity are two distinctly different things, another problem the traditional equations fail to acknowledge. In noncompetitive inhibition the binding of the inhibitor results in 100% inhibition of the enzyme only, and fails to consider the possibility of anything in between. The common form of the inhibitory term also obscures the relationship between the inhibitor binding to the enzyme and its relationship to any other binding term be it the Michaelis–Menten equation or a dose <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> associated with ligand receptor binding. To demonstrate the relationship the following rearrangement can be made: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{parametric}} equaliser is {{an audio}} filter {{that allows the}} frequency of maximum cut or boost to be set by one control, {{and the size of}} the cut or boost by another. These settings, the frequency level of the peak or trough, are two of the parameters of a frequency <b>response</b> <b>curve,</b> and in a two-control equaliser they completely describe the curve.

2500|$|Melatonin {{taken an}} hour or so before the usual bedtime may induce sleepiness. Taken this late, it does not, of itself, affect {{circadian}} rhythms, but a decrease in exposure to light in the evening is helpful in establishing an earlier pattern. In accordance with its phase <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> (PRC), a very small dose of melatonin can also, or instead, be taken some hours earlier as an aid to resetting the body clock; it must then be small enough not to induce excessive sleepiness.|$|E

Although modern photography is dominated by digital users, film continues {{to be used by}} enthusiasts and professional photographers. The distinctive [...] "look" [...] of film based photographs compared to digital images is likely due to a combination of factors, including: (1) differences in spectral and tonal sensitivity (S-shaped density-to-exposure (H curve) with film vs. linear <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> for digital CCD sensors) [...] (2) resolution and (3) continuity of tone.|$|E

40|$|Soil CO 2 efflux (SCE) is an {{important}} component of ecosystem CO 2 exchange and is largely temperature and moisture dependent, providing feedback between C cycling and the climate system. We used a precipitation manipulation experiment {{to examine the effects of}} precipitation treatment on SCE and its dependences on soil temperature and moisture in a semiarid grassland. Precipitation manipulation included ambient precipitation, decreased precipitation (- 43 %), or increased precipitation (+ 17 %). The SCE was measured from July 2013 to December 2014, and CO 2 emission during the experimental period was assessed. The <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> of SCE to soil temperature and moisture were analyzed to determine whether the dependence of SCE on soil temperature or moisture varied with precipitation manipulation. The SCE significantly varied seasonally but was not affected by precipitation treatments regardless of season. Increasing precipitation resulted in an upward shift of SCE-temperature <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> and rightward shift of SCE-moisture <b>response</b> <b>curves,</b> while decreasing precipitation resulted in opposite shifts of such <b>response</b> <b>curves.</b> These shifts in the SCE <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> suggested that increasing precipitation strengthened the dependence of SCE on temperature or moisture, and decreasing precipitation weakened such dependences. Such shifts affected the predictions in soil CO 2 emissions for different precipitation treatments. When considering such shifts, decreasing or increasing precipitation resulted in 43 or 75 % less change, respectively, in CO 2 emission compared with changes in emissions predicted without considering such shifts. Furthermore, the effects of shifts in SCE <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> on CO 2 emission prediction were greater during the growing than the non-growing season.

2500|$|For a Type I {{functional}} <b>response</b> <b>curve,</b> {{the rate}} of prey capture increases linearly with food density. At low prey densities, the search time is long. Since the predator spends most of its time searching, it eats every prey item it finds. [...] As prey density increases, the predator is able to capture the prey faster and faster. [...] At a certain point, {{the rate of}} prey capture is so high, that the predator doesn't have to eat every prey item it encounters. [...] After this point, the predator should only choose the prey items with the highest E/h.|$|E
2500|$|Equalizers are {{electronic}} devices that allow audio engineers {{to control the}} tone and frequencies of the sound in a channel, group (e.g., all the mics on a drumkit) or an entire stage's mix. The bass and treble controls on a home stereo are a simple type of equalizer. Equalizers exist in pro sound reinforcement systems in three forms: shelving equalizers (typically for {{a whole range of}} bass and treble frequencies), graphic equalizers and parametric equalizers. Graphic equalizers have faders (vertical slide controls) which together resemble a frequency <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> plotted on a graph. The faders can be used to boost or cut specific frequency bands.|$|E
2500|$|For a Type II {{functional}} <b>response</b> <b>curve,</b> {{the rate}} of prey capture negatively accelerates as it increases with food density. This is because it assumes that the predator is limited by its capacity to process food. [...] In other words, as the food density increases, handling time increases. At {{the beginning of the}} curve, rate of prey capture increases nearly linearly with prey density and there is almost no handling time. [...] As prey density increases, the predator spends less and less time searching for prey and more and more time handling the prey. The rate of prey capture increases less and less, until it finally plateaus. [...] The high number of prey basically [...] "swamps" [...] the predator.|$|E

40|$|Although {{chemical}} and biological monitoring {{is often used to}} evaluate the quality of surface waters for regulatory purposes and/or to evaluate environmental status and trends, the resulting biological and chemical data sets are large and difficult to evaluate. Multivariate techniques have long been used to analyse complex data sets. This paper discusses the methods currently in use and introduces the principal <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> method, which overcomes the problem of cluttered graphical results representation that is a great drawback of most conventional methods. To illustrate this, two example data sets are analysed using two ordination techniques, principal component analysis and principal <b>response</b> <b>curves.</b> Whereas PCA results in a difficult-to-interpret diagram, principal <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> related methods are able to show changes in community composition in a diagram that is easy to read.

40|$|Distortion {{analysis}} of nonlinear circuits {{is very important}} for designing analog integrated circuits. Especially, the fre-quency <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> are useful to know the global prop-erties of the circuits. Of course, AC-{{analysis of}} Spice is used for this purpose, but it can only get the <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> for the linear incremental circuits at the DC operating point. Thus, we need to develop a user-friendly simulator to cal-culate the <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> for the practical forced inputs. The characteristic curves may be largely {{different from those of the}} incremental linear circuits. We propose here an effi-cient approach based on the Spice-oriented harmonic balance method, where the Fourier transformations of the nonlinear devices such as bipolar transistors and MOSFETs are car-ried out with our Fourier transfer circuit model. Note that the circuit models are constructed by the analog behavior models (ABMs) of Spice. The Fourier circuits correspond-ing to the determining equations in our harmonic balance method are schematically described by coupled resistive DC, Cosine and Sine circuits. Therefore, the frequency <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> can be easily obtained with a use of DC analysis of Spice. 1...|$|R
2500|$|The {{physiological}} blood-flow response largely decides {{the temporal}} sensitivity, {{that is how}} accurately we can measure when neurons are active, in BOLD fMRI. The basic time resolution parameter (sampling time) is designated TR; the TR dictates how often a particular brain slice is excited and allowed to lose its magnetization. [...] TRs could vary from the very short (500ms) to the very long (3s). For fMRI specifically, the hemodynamic response lasts over 10 seconds, rising multiplicatively (that is, {{as a proportion of}} current value), peaking at 4 to 6 seconds, and then falling multiplicatively. Changes in the blood-flow system, the vascular system, integrate responses to neuronal activity over time. Because this response is a smooth continuous function, sampling with ever-faster TRs does not help; it just gives more points on the <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> obtainable by simple linear interpolation anyway. Experimental paradigms such as staggering when a stimulus is presented at various trials can improve temporal resolution, but reduces the number of effective data points obtained.|$|E
2500|$|For ligand-gated ion {{channels}} or {{channels that}} are modulated by metabotropic receptors, the neurotransmitter or drug being studied is usually {{included in the}} pipette solution, where it can interact with {{what used to be}} the external surface of the membrane. The resulting channel activity can be attributed to the drug being used, although it is usually not possible to then change the drug concentration inside the pipette. The technique is thus limited to one point in a dose <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> per patch. Therefore, the dose response is accomplished using several cells and patches. [...] However, voltage-gated ion channels can be clamped successively at different membrane potentials in a single patch. This results in channel activation as a function of voltage, and a complete I-V (current-voltage) curve can be established in only one patch. Another potential drawback of this technique is that, just as the intracellular pathways of the cell are not disturbed, they cannot be directly modified either.|$|E
2500|$|A Type III {{functional}} <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> is a sigmoid curve. [...] The rate of prey capture increases {{at first}} with prey density at a positively accelerated rate, but then at high densities {{changes to the}} negatively accelerated form, {{similar to that of}} the Type II curve. At high prey densities (the top of the curve), each new prey item is caught almost immediately. The predator is able to be choosy and doesn't eat every item it finds. [...] So, assuming that there are two prey types with different profitabilities that are both at high abundance, the predator will choose the item with the higher E/h. [...] However, at low prey densities (the bottom of the curve) the rate of prey capture increases faster than linearly. This means that as the predator feeds and the prey type with the higher E/h becomes less abundant, the predator will start to switch its preference to the prey type with the lower E/h, because that type will be relatively more abundant. [...] This phenomenon is known as prey switching.|$|E
