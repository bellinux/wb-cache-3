40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{new data}} on the levels of lipid and phytosterol oxidation products (POPs) in French fries and potato crisps consumed in Sweden. The levels of POPs in fried foods have attracted interest in recent years because of their potential harmful health effects. The analytical methods used here for the determination of POPs in commercial prefried French fries, French fries collected from fast food restaurants and commercial potato crisps included transesterification, SPE, GC and GC-MS. Higher amounts of total POPs were generally found in French fries prepared in restaurants (1. 5 - 8. 1 µg/g sample) than in prefried French fries (0. 1 - 2. 1 µg/g sample). In potato crisps, the total POPs content ranged from 0. 5 to 6. 8 µg/g sample. In general, no correlation could be established between the POPs content and the fatty acid profile, tocopherol, tocotrienol and sterol content {{in any of the}} fried potato products tested. However, these parameters provided information on the type of frying oil used in the preparation of the commercial fried potato products. The possibility of minimising lipid oxidation and POPs formation in some regular and oleic acid-dominated vegetable oils was examined. The oxidative stability was evaluated in these vegetable oils with and without addition of α-tocopherol and the results showed that addition of α-tocopherol (500 - 20000 µg/g) increased Rancimat stability only in <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> After heating at 180 ºC for up to 12 h, the levels of POPs generally increased over time in high oleic rapeseed oil, palm olein and <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> The addition of 0. 2 % α-tocopherol to <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> decreased POPs formation significantly during heating. Studies on the quality of French fries prepared at 180 ºC in <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and palm olein in five batches at 1 -hour intervals showed a higher content of POPs in French fries prepared in <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> However, all other frying quality parameters tested, such as total polar compounds, free fatty acids and p-anisidine value, were significantly lower in the French fries prepared in <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> than in those prepared in palm olein...|$|E
40|$|Extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> {{are high}} price commodities, {{because of their}} {{production}} process combined with corresponding nutritional properties and sensorial quality.

In particular, a mathematical treatment of the spectra was developed in order to quantify four main pigments: pheophytin-a, pheophytin-b, β-carotene and lutein. Proton NMR measurements on oil samples were performed by using three instruments at different frequency (2 MHz, 100 MHz and 500 MHz). 1 H NMR investigation focuses on the relaxation and diffusion properties of oil samples.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of the refined palm oil addition (20 %) on the fatty acid and sterol compositions of <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> or refined soya bean oil and also to investigate the formation of total polar compounds and volatile compounds in these oil blends during fifty successive deep-frying sessions of potato fries at 180  °C. The blend of <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and refined palm oil exhibited a higher chemical stability during the frying process than that of refined soya bean oil and refined palm oil. Indeed, the total polar compounds and volatile compounds formed, especially 2, 4 -decadienal, were found to be relatively increased in the refined soya bean oil/refined palm oil blend reaching 36. 50 % and 46. 70 %, respectively, after fifty deep-frying sessions. Moreover, the degradation of linoleic acid and β-sitosterol was significantly (P <  0. 05) observed for the refined soya bean oil/refined palm oil blend.

30|$|EEC Regulation 2568 / 91 [1] and International Olive Council (IOC) [2] have {{established}} both analytical and organoleptic criteria {{to define the}} quality grade of an <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> According {{to the results of}} chemical and sensory analyses, an <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> can be classified as extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (EVOO), virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> or lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Each category has a completely different commercial and nutritional value.

40|$|An {{association}} between the intake of heterocyclic amines (HAs) {{and the development of}} cancer has been observed in some epidemiological studies, while in other studies no such correlation has been found. HAs are mutagenic/carcinogenic compounds formed at low levels via the Maillard reaction and a free radical mechanism during cooking of animal tissue. The addition of pure antioxidants or foods containing antioxidants has previously been shown to decrease the amount of HAs formed during cooking. In this study, beefburgers were fried in six different oils: <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> virgin olive oil, virgin olive oil depleted of phenols, rapeseed oil, virgin olive oil with rosemary extract and <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> with rosemary extract.

Matters of practicality determine the use of rats rather than humans as the model of choice. Also, growing interest in nutraceuticals is leading to the formulation of compounds containing olive oil phenols. In this study, we compared metabolism and urinary excretion of hydroxytyrosol [(HT); the most representative phenol of olive oil] between rats and humans by evaluating excretion of HT and its major metabolite, homovanillyl alcohol. Also, we compared human excretion of HT when consumed as a natural component of extra virgin olive oil, when added to <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> or when added to yogurt (as an approximation of functional food). Urinary excretion of HT was greater in humans than in rats, a species with a high basal excretion of HT and its metabolites. The high (234 % of HT administered) excretion of free HT suggests that hydrolysis of oleuropein administered in humans (still an unresolved issue) occurs in vivo. Moreover, human HT excretion was much higher after its administration as a natural component of olive oil (44. 2 % of HT administered) than after its addition to <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (23 % of HT administered) or yogurt (5. 8 % of dose or similar to 13 % of that recorded after virgin olive oil intake).

40|$|Background: The {{study on}} natural {{substances}} especially, dietary components such as liquid oils affecting cholesterol can {{be important for}} therapeutic propose. Sesame seeds with various biomedical actions can be control the hypercholesterolemia. On the other hand, <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> has {{a wide range of}} therapeutic effect on lipid profile in human. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate and compare lipid profile changes after <b>olive</b> and sesame <b>oils</b> consumption in hypercholesterolemia. Methods: This study was a clinical randomized trial that was performed via parallel design on 48 patients. The patients were randomly allocated in to two groups: A: <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and B: sesame oil. After 1 month prescription of Step I National Cholesterol Education Program diet, patients consumed 4 table spoons aprox. 60 g) of <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> or sesame <b>oil</b> daily as an exchange of other oils, for 1 month.

Conclusions: Sesame oil had equivalent effect on lipid profile in comparison <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and lipid profile improvement was better in sesame oil in LDL-C and TG...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the a priori dietary indexes used in the studies that have {{evaluated}} the role of the Mediterranean Diet in influencing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. All the studies show that this dietary pattern protects against cardiovascular disease, but studies show quite different effects on specific conditions such as coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease. A priori dietary indexes used to measure dietary exposure imply quantitative and/or qualitative divergences from the traditional Mediterranean Diet of the early 1960 s, and, therefore, it is very difficult to compare the results of different studies. Based on real cultural heritage and traditions, we believe that the a priori indexes used to evaluate adherence to the Mediterranean Diet should consider classifying whole grains and <b>refined</b> grains, <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and monounsaturated fats, and wine and alcohol differently...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract A {{series of}} 25 virgin and refined edible oils, {{obtained}} from the retail market was analyzed for the content of free 3 -MCPD and 3 -MCPD released from its esters with higher fatty acids (bound 3 -MCPD). The oils contained free 3 -MCPD ranging from < 3 ƒÝg/kg (LOD) to 24 ƒÝg/kg. Surprisingly, the bound 3 -MCPD level was much higher and varied between < 100 ƒÝg/kg (LOD) and 2462 ƒÝg/kg. In average, virgin oils had relatively low levels of bound 3 -MCPD ranging from < 100 ƒÝg/kg (LOD) to < 300 ƒÝg/kg (LOQ). Higher levels of bound 3 -MCPD were found in oils obtained from roasted oilseeds (337 ƒÝg/kg) and {{in the majority of}} refined oils (< 300 ƒÝg/kg to 2462 ƒÝg/kg), including <b>refined</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> In general, it appears that the formation of bound 3 -MCPD in oils is linked with the preliminary heat treatment of oilseeds and with the process of oil refining. The analysis of unrefined, degummed, bleached, and deodorized rapeseed oil showed that the level of bound MCPD decreased during the refining process. However, additional heating of seed oils for 30 minutes at temperatures ranging from 100 oC to 280 oC, and heating at 230 oC (260 oC) for up to 8 hours led to an increase of the bound 3 -MCPD level. On the contrary, heating of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> resulted in a decrease of the bound 3 -MCPD level. For comparison, the fat isolated from salami was analyzed for the intact fatty acid esters of 3 -MCPD. This fat contained the bound 3 -MCPD at the level of 1670 ƒÝg/kg and the fatty acid esters of 3 -MCPD mainly consisted of 3 -MCPD diesters, monoesters of 3 -MCPD were present in smaller amounts. The major types of 3 -MCPD diesters (about 85 %) were mixed diesters of palmitic acid with C 18 fatty acids (stearic, oleic, linoleic acids). These diesters were followed by 3 -MCPD distearate (11 %) and 3 -MCPD dipalmitate (4 %). Generally, very little 3 -MCPD existed as the free compound (31 ƒÝg/kg) ...|$|R
