The present paper attempts to explain exactly what such ‘pseudo-assertions’ are, and how they behave. Many pseudo-assertions can take on multiple roles, both within fictions and in what I call ‘participatory criticism’ of a fiction, especially when they occur discourse-initially. This fact, taken together with problems for <b>replacement</b> <b>accounts</b> of pseudo-assertion based on the implicit prefixing of an ‘in the fiction’ operator, suggest that pseudo-assertion is best understood as a kind of make-believe.

The Gewald thiophene synthesis was utilized to obtain several ethyl 2 -aminothiophene- 3 -carboxylates. These precursors {{were subjected to}} a five-step route to obtain thieno[2, 3 -d][1, 3]oxazin- 4 -ones bearing various substituents at positions 5 and 6.

25|$|The Rome branch {{was always}} busy. The Papal court was {{attended}} by hundreds of minor officials, both ecclesiastical and secular, along with their attendants. The needs of the Papal court were such {{that there was a}} measurable rise in the frequency of money shortages wherever the court went. This led to a need for banking services that the Medici could provide. The various bishops, cardinals, and prelates often held Church or private estates in far-flung states in and beyond Italy. The revenues from these estates needed to be transferred to wherever the Court was residing. A more practical reason was that alternate investments generally took the form of real estate, and any cardinal or bishop who invested overly much in real estate (which they were not supposed to) or relied on income from Church lands might see his investments confiscated under a new Pope who might not favor him so much or even turned over to a <b>replacement.</b> <b>Accounts</b> with the Medici were kept secret and generally free from prying, ecclesiastical eyes, {{especially in the case of}} discretionary deposits.|$|R
40|$|Protein-protein {{interactions}} effectively mediate molecular function. They are {{the result}} of specific interactions between protein interfaces and are maintained by the action of evolutionary pressure on the regions of the interacting proteins that contribute to binding. For the most part, selection restricts amino acid <b>replacements,</b> <b>accounting</b> for the conservation of binding interfaces. However, in some cases, change in one protein will be mitigated by compensatory change in its binding partner, maintaining function in the face of evolutionary change. There have been several attempts to use correlations in sequence evolution to predict interactions of proteins. Most commonly, these approaches use the entire sequence to identify correlations and so infer probable binding. However, other factors such as shared evolutionary history and similarities in the rates of evolution confound these whole-sequence-based approaches. Here, we discuss recent work on this topic and argue that both site-specific coevolutionary change and whole-sequence evolution contribute to evolutionary signals in sets of interacting proteins. We discuss the relative effects of both types of selection and how they might be identified. This permits an integrated view of protein-protein interactions, their evolution, and coevolution...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies accrual {{accounting}} and equity valuation {{in the context}} of a firm that makes repeated and overlapping investments in productive capacity. The analysis identifies a particular {{accrual accounting}} (depreciation) rule which is termed replace-ment cost accounting because the book value of existing capacity assets is set equal to the value that such assets would have if a competitive market were to exist for used assets. It is shown that <b>replacement</b> cost <b>accounting</b> aggregates past investment decisions of the firm without a loss of value-relevant information. In particular, the intrinsic value of the firm can then be expressed as a function of current accounting data and projections of growth in the firm’s output market. Further, it is shown that <b>replacement</b> cost <b>accounting</b> is essentially the only accounting rule with this informa-tional sufficiency property. In many environments of interest, standard depreciation rules, such as the straight-line rule, will not coincide with replacement cost account-ing. Nonetheless, even informationally insufficient accounting rules are shown to be useful to investors. In particular, the analysis in this paper characterizes a best value estimator and derives upper bounds on the valuation errors associated with alternative accounting rules...|$|R

40|$|A dynamic {{programming}} model {{was developed to}} determine the optimum replacement policy of dairy cows. In the model cows were {{described in terms of}} lactation number, stage of lactation and the level of milk production during the previous and present lactations. The objective in determining the optimum replacement policy was to maximize the present value of net revenues from the present and subsequent replacement cows over a 20 -year planning horizon. Milk and calf revenues, feed costs, carcass value, cost of replacement heifers and the probability of and financial loss associated with involuntary replacement were considered. The optimum replacement decisions corresponded with an average herd life of 42. 9 months. Voluntary <b>replacement</b> <b>accounted</b> for 26 % of all replacements. Changes in the price of a replacement heifer or the carcass price for culled cows had a considerable effect on the optimum replacement policy. A reduction in the difference between the carcass value of culled cows and the replacement costs resulted in a higher rate of voluntary replacement. Changes in the price of milk, calves or feed, the production level of the herd or the rate of genetic improvement did not greatly affect the optimum replacement policy. The financial advantage of a reduction in involuntary disposal rates increased when voluntary replacement of cows according to the optimum policy took place. These changes in voluntary replacement rates however reduced the effect on the optimum average herd life of cows...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the population-level impact of such a change on energy, macronutrient and nutrient intakes, and diet cost. DesignCross-sectional modeling study. SettingData from the 2001 – 2002 and 2003 – 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. ParticipantsA total of 8, 112 children aged 2 – 19  years. Main Outcome MeasuresEnergy, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake before and after replacement of MER with low-fat or skim milk. AnalysisSurvey-weighted linear regression models. ResultsMilk eligible for <b>replacement</b> <b>accounted</b> for 46 % of dairy servings. Among MER consumers, replacement with skim or low-fat milk would lead to a projected reduction in energy of 113 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 107 – 119) and 77 (95 % CI, 73 – 82) kcal/d and percent energy from saturated fat by an absolute value of 2. 5 % of total energy (95 % CI, 2. 4 – 2. 6) and 1. 4 % (95 % CI, 1. 3 – 1. 5), respectively. Replacement of MER does not change diet costs or calcium and potassium intake.

The feasibility of such replacement has not been examined and there may be negative consequences if replacement is done with non-nutrient–rich beverages...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{analytical}} mean-field theory for the pair interaction between two colloidal particles, {{based upon a}} recent mean-field equation for the depletion thickness 6 which depends on the chain length N, the bulk concentration psi(b), and the solvency chi. Only in the extremely dilute case is (in mean field) the interaction independent of X. At relevant concentrations a better solvency leads for two flat plates to a stronger attraction at contact (similar topsi(b) /delta) and a smaller range of attraction. This range is 2 delta(i), where the "interaction distance" delta(i) is in semidilute solutions larger than delta. In the dilute limit, both delta and delta(i) reduce to depletion thickness delta(0) of ideal chains. The pair potential for flat plates can be described by a modified Asakura-Oosawa equation, in which delta(i) {{takes the place of}} the original delta(0); this <b>replacement</b> <b>accounts</b> for the concentration and solvency dependence. For the interaction between two spheres of radius a the contact potential is of order alphapsi(b) and nearly insensitive to solvency; again, the range of attraction is smaller for better solvents. For two spheres we calculate the second virial coefficient as a function of concentration and solvent quality and its consequences for the stability of a colloidal dispersion at low colloid concentrations. For relatively short polymer chains the solvent quality hardly matters. For intermediate and large polymer-to-colloid size ratios, increasing the solvent quality leads to an increased miscibility. This implies that the increase in the osmotic pressure for polymers in a good solvent is overcompensated by a decrease of the depletion thickness, leading to weaker interactions...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{passing of}} the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 set new {{standards}} for health care and payer reform. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation {{has been charged with}} the task of piloting new payment programs, including bundled payment methods. Total knee and hip <b>replacements</b> <b>account</b> for a large portion of Medicare spending yearly and the rate of these procedures continues to rise. Many bundled programs target these patients because they are high volume and predictable in recovery. The goal {{of this paper is to}} analyze bundled payments as a health policy for this population and lead physical therapists, significant clinical providers for these patients, in supporting such payment structures for the future. Methods: Extensive literature review and interviews of experts in the bundled payment field were completed. Bundled payments are analyzed as a health policy, current programs are addressed, policy options identified, and therapists provided recommendations to support implementation in the future. Summary: The Bundled Payment for Care Improvement, Prometheus, and Comprehensive Joint Replacement Models offer alternate payments methods for total hip and knee replacements. Each bundle provides pros and cons for health systems and patients. Physical therapists could support the current fee for service model or one of these three models as a policy plan. Conclusion: After a literature review and considering the role of the physical therapist in TKR and THR, it is recommended that the Prometheus Model be utilized as a policy by CMS for bundled payment. There are multiple policy reforms therapists should support to assist with bundled payment including Telehealth privileges, shared billing and assessment for post acute providers, and fair outpatient copays. Therapists will need to prepare for the future of bundled payment and consider their role in patient recovery in order to be primary stakeholders in these payment systems. Presentation: 43 : 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{ongoing process}} of {{population}} aging {{is associated with}} an increase in prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions with a concomitant increase in the demand of orthopaedic services. Shortages of orthopaedic services have been documented in Canada and elsewhere. This population-based study describes the number of patients seen by orthopaedic surgeons in office and hospital settings to set the scene for the development of strategies that could maximize the availability of orthopaedic resources. Methods Administrative data from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan and Canadian Institute for Health Information hospital separation databases for the 2005 / 06 fiscal year were used to identify individuals accessing orthopaedic services in Ontario, Canada. The number of patients with encounters with orthopaedic surgeons, the number of encounters and the number of surgeries carried out by orthopaedic surgeons were estimated according to condition groups, service location, patient's age and sex. Results In 2005 / 06, over 520, 000 Ontarians (41 per 1, 000 population) had over 1. 3 million encounters with orthopaedic surgeons. Of those 86 % were ambulatory encounters and 14 % were in hospital encounters. The majority of ambulatory encounters were for an injury or related condition (44 %) followed by arthritis and related conditions (37 %). Osteoarthritis accounted for 16 % of all ambulatory encounters. Orthopaedic surgeons carried out over 140, 000 surgeries in 2005 / 06 : joint <b>replacement</b> <b>accounted</b> for 25 % of all orthopaedic surgeries, whereas closed repair accounted for 16 % and reductions accounted for 21 %. Half of the orthopaedic surgeries were for arthritis and related conditions. Conclusion The large volume of ambulatory care points to the significant contribution of orthopaedic surgeons to the medical management of chronic musculoskeletal conditions including arthritis and injuries. The findings highlight that surgery is only one component of the work of orthopaedic surgeons in the management of these conditions. Policy makers and orthopaedic surgeons need to be creative in developing strategies to accommodate the growing workload of orthopaedic surgeons without sacrificing quality of care of patients with musculoskeletal conditions. </p...|$|R

25|$|Herd {{immunity}} {{is often}} accounted for when conducting cost–benefit analyses of vaccination programs. It {{is regarded as}} a positive externality of high levels of immunity, producing an additional benefit of disease reduction that would not occur had no herd immunity been generated in the population. Therefore, herd immunity's inclusion in cost–benefit analyses results in more favorable cost-effectiveness or cost–benefit ratios and {{an increase in the number}} of disease cases averted by vaccination. Study designs done to estimate herd immunity's benefit include recording disease incidence in households in which a member was vaccinated, randomizing a population in a single geographic area to be vaccinated or not, and observing disease incidence before and after a vaccination program is introduced. From these, it can be observed that disease incidence may decrease to a level beyond what can be predicted from direct protection alone, indicating that herd immunity contributed to the reduction.

Unfortunately, this trend is expected to escalate in the foreseeable future. Cardiovascular disease remains one of the main problems in contemporary health care worldwide, accounting for approximately one third of the world’s total death (Poole-Wilson, 2005). This article focuses on a subgroup of cardiovascular disease known as valvular heart disease whereby abnormalities or malfunctions of the heart valves are detected.

Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that osteoarthritis has a chronic inflammatory component to its pathogenesis similar to age-related macular degeneration. We evaluated the association between age-related macular degeneration and total hip replacement as proxy for severe osteoarthritis or fractured neck of femur in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. 20, 744 participants had complete data on both age-related macular degeneration assessed from colour fundus photographs taken during 2003 - 2007 and total hip replacement. Total hip replacements due to hip osteoarthritis and fractured neck of femur during 2001 - 2011 were identified by linking the cohort records to the Australian Orthopedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between age-related macular degeneration and risk of total hip replacement due to osteoarthritis and fracture separately, adjusted for confounders. There were 791 cases of total hip replacement for osteoarthritis and 102 cases of total hip replacement due to fractured neck of femur. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, and grouped country of birth, intermediate age-related macular degeneration was directly associated with total hip replacement for osteoarthritis (odds ratio 1. 22, 95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 49). Late age-related macular degeneration was directly associated with total hip replacement due to fractured neck of femur (odds ratio 5. 21, 95 % CI 2. 25 - 12. 02). The association between intermediate age-related macular degeneration and an increased 10 -year incidence of total hip replacement due to osteoarthritis suggests the possibility of similar inflammatory processes underlying both chronic diseases. The association of late age-related macular degeneration with an increased 10 -year incidence of total hip replacement due to fractured neck of femur may be due to an increased prevalence of fractures in those with poor central vision associated with the late complications of age-related macular degeneration.

We find that rising income uncertainty and pension reforms help explain {{both of these}} phenomena. Using a panel of Chinese households covering the period 1989 - 2006, we document that strong average income growth {{has been accompanied by}} a substantial increase in income uncertainty. Interestingly, the permanent variance of household income remains stable while it is the transitory variance that rises sharply. A calibration of a buffer-stock savings model indicates that rising savings rates among younger households are consistent with rising income uncertainty and higher saving rates among older households are consistent with a decline in the pension replacement ratio for those retiring after 1997. We conclude that rising income uncertainty and pension reforms can account for over half of the increase in the urban household savings rate in China since the mid- 1990 s as well as the U-shaped age-profile of savings.

We also demonstrate that partitions can be easily incorporated into the Clock replacement algorithm, thus increasing the likelihood of deploying cost-aware algorithms in modern operating systems...|$|R
40|$|Private {{business}} investment has expanded remarkably in Colombia's recent economic recovery. Sustained expansion of this investment is considered crucial to continued {{economic growth and}} increases in production. Having analyzed demand, the cost of capital, and the availability and allocation of investable funds, the paper makes the following conclusions. First, motivating firms to expand capacity is a key requirement for continued expansion. Secondly, frequent forecasting of such variables as GDP, interest and exchange rates, and credit and monetary aggregates, would tend to improve the climate for investment. Also, the real (marginal) cost of capital to the nonfinancial corporate sector is high: currently about 16 percent. Policy efforts that induce corporations to substitute equity for debt financing should {{lead to a more}} balanced corporate capital structure and possibly a lower overall cost of capital. It could also be reduced by shifting the tax treatment of depreciation allowances away from historical cost accounting system toward a <b>replacement</b> cost <b>accounting</b> system. Finally, high inflation and low savings rates keep the prevailing lending rates high in Colombia - and it is generally easier for larger firms to get capital than for small and medium-size firms.

5|$|In the Battle of Verona on 18 October 1805, André Masséna led the converged light {{companies}} of his army supported by two infantry divisions in an assault {{crossing of the}} river on Verona's west side. The French stormed across the Castelvecchio Bridge and quickly captured San Giorgio, but Vukassovich threw more infantry and cavalry into the struggle for the heights, which lasted most of the day. A French diversion at Pescantina occupied his right flank brigade, keeping {{it out of the}} fight. Meanwhile, a second diversion at Albaredo d'Adige fooled Charles into thinking it was the main attack. Only {{at the end of the}} day did Count Heinrich von Bellegarde appear with reinforcements, but it was too late to stop Masséna from establishing a bridgehead on the hills to the north of the city. Believing that Vukassovich held the riverbank with too few troops, archduke dismissed him from command and appointed Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg-Orsini as his <b>replacement.</b> Another <b>account</b> asserts that Vukassovich was sacked because he placed a number of cannons in an exposed position in violation of Charles' orders. At Verona, the Austrians suffered 1,622 casualties and loss of four cannons, while the French only lost about 450 killed and wounded.|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} in many circles that a {{structural}} change occurred in U. S. collective bargaining in the 1980 s. We investigate {{the extent to}} which the hiring of <b>replacement</b> workers can <b>account</b> for this change. For a sample of over 300 major strikes since 1980, we estimate the likelihood of replacements being hired. We find that the risk of replacement declines during tight labor markets, and is lower for bargaining units with more experienced workers. We use the predicted replacement risk as an explanatory variable in a model of the union's choice between the strike and holdout threat. We find that strike usage decreases significantly as the predicted replacement risk increases. We estimate that a ban on the use of replacement workers would have increased strike incidence from 1982 - 1989 by 3 percentage points, a 30 percent increase. ...|$|R
40|$|Historical {{development}} of Bulgarian accountancy {{under the influence}} of French accounting system – Comptabilite generale et analytique, during XX century is presented and the problems of its going ahead under the established transitional economy. On the basis of historic-logical approach are characterized the impact of pre-war European accounting in Bulgaria and the attempts of its full <b>replacement</b> with ex-USSR <b>accounting</b> after WWII. The adequate reasons are explained in the light of economic schools of value. Emphasis is put on the post-war contradiction between Marxist value theory as a base for the centralized accountting and the Russian mathematical economics as a base for Bulgarian alternative of Comptabilite analytique. This alternativer was bult following the theory L. Kanthorovich for economic optimization. The model for a present revenues-costs co-measurement is charecterized, emphasising on its borrowings from the adequate French models. Key words: manufacturing accounting; command economy; transitional economy, operational costing. 1...|$|R
