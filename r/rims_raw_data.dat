40|$|International audienceComputer {{simulations}} consume {{and produce}} {{huge amounts of}} <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> files presented in different formats, e. g., HDF 5 in computational fluid dynamics simulations. Users often need to analyze domain-specific data based on related data elements from multiple files during the execution of computer simulations. In a <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> analysis, one should identify regions {{of interest in the}} data space and retrieve the content of specific related <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> files. Existing solutions, such as FastBit and RAW, are limited to a single <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> file analysis and can only be used after the execution of computer simulations. Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWMS) can manage the dataflow of computer simulations and register related <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> files at a provenance database. This paper aims to combine the advantages of a dataflow-aware SWMS and the <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> file analysis techniques to allow for queries on <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> file elements that are related, but reside in separate files. We propose a component-based architecture, named as ARMFUL (Analysis of <b>Raw</b> <b>data</b> from Multiple Files) with <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> extraction and indexing techniques, which allows for a direct access to specific elements or regions of <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> space. ARMFUL innovates by using a SWMS provenance database to add a dataflow access path to <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> files. ARMFUL facilitates the invocation of ad-hoc programs and third party tools (e. g., FastBit tool) for <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> analyses. In our experiments, a real parallel computational fluid dynamics is executed, exploring different alternatives of <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> extraction, indexing and analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Large areas {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> simulation,which contains various actual systemerrors, {{is one of the}} main tasks in SAR system design and development. The growth of swath and resolution results in a significant increase in data volume as well as the simulation time. This poses a challenge for SAR <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> simulation considering system errors. For recent years, the graphics processing unit (GPU) -based scalable parallel method has been applied to <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> simulation. In this paper, we investigate time-domain SAR <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> simulation for large areas on multi-GPUs architecture, which can not only simulate <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> of large areas by task partitioning and scheduling, but also improve the efficiency of current GPU-based algorithm by access conflict opti-mization and fine-grained parallel pipeline. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-GPUs-based <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> simulation method achieves a speedup compared to the currentGPU-based method on single GPU, and a significant over speedup on 4 GPUs compared to traditional CPU-based simulation. These results verify that multi-GPUs-based time-domain method is very suitable for large <b>data</b> volume <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> simulation, especially for the case of wide swath and high resolution.

40|$|International audienceData {{aggregation}} is {{an important}} mechanism to reduce energy consumption in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). By investigating spatial and/or temporal correlation of <b>raw</b> <b>data,</b> sensor nodes can aggregate <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> to a meaningful digest instead of directly sending <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> to sink, this process is considered as data aggregation. Several aggregation works focus on the <b>raw</b> <b>data,</b> they use <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> to cluster the nodes or to do aggregation. While analysis of datasets of real projects shows that some nodes perform similar evolution. Thus we propose a raw data-independent aggregation, i. e., Similar-evolution Based Aggregation (Simba), to consider the evolution of data rather than the <b>raw</b> <b>data.</b> Simba creates a group out of isolated nodes, nodes in the group can cooperatively execute data aggregation, this process reduces the energy consumption on each node. Besides, similar evolution of nodes guarantees the recover accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that Simba can save more than 91 % energy comparing no aggregation, and save more 30 % energy than original aggregation functions, and Simba can recover data with higher fidelity comparing with the works relying on <b>raw</b> <b>data...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceComputer {{simulations}} may ingest {{and generate}} {{high numbers of}} <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> files. Most of these files follow a de facto standard format established by the application domain, e. g., FITS for astronomy. Although these formats are supported {{by a variety of}} programming languages, libraries and programs, analyzing thousands or millions of files requires developing specific programs. Database Management Systems (DBMS) are not suited for this, because they require loading the <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> and structuring it, which gets heavy at large-scale. Systems like NoDB, RAW and FastBit, have been proposed to index and query <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> files without the overhead of using a DBMS. However, these solutions are focused on analyzing one single large file instead of several related files. In this case, when related files are produced and required for analysis, the relationship among elements within file contents must be managed manually, with specific programs to access <b>raw</b> <b>data.</b> Thus, this data management may be time-consuming and error-prone. When computer simulations are managed by a Scientific Workflow Management System (SWfMS), they can take advantage of provenance data to relate and analyze <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> files produced during workflow execution. However, SWfMS register provenance at a coarse grain, with limited analysis on elements from <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> files. When the SWfMS is dataflow-aware, it can register provenance data and the relationships among elements of <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> files altogether in a database which is useful to access the contents {{of a large number of}} files. In this paper, we propose a dataflow approach for analyzing element data from several related <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> files. Our approach is complementary to the existing single <b>raw</b> <b>data</b> file analysis approaches. We use the Montage workflow from astronomy and a workflow from Oil and Gas domain as I/O intensive case studies.
