5|$|On December 27, 1977, {{just two}} weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. He pulled himself together, and began <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.|$|E

25|$|Their nests may {{be located}} in the trees or on the ground. Ground nests, {{frequently}} located near leaf litter, may be fabricated within sunken areas of the soil or beneath logs. Ground nests have both advantages and disadvantages. Floods or wet soil may force golden mice to leave their ground nests and relocate into the trees. However, if the ground nest is undisturbed, it can lower the risk for predation for the following reasons: the nest is well hidden, a mouse on the ground is more likely to escape a predator, and less energy is required to build a nest on the ground since the mouse doesn't have to keep <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down a tree with nesting materials.|$|E

25|$|In his autobiography, Cushing {{implies that}} he {{attempted}} suicide {{on the night}} of his wife's death by <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down stairs in the vain hope that it would induce a heart attack. He later stated that this had simply been a hysterical response borne out of grief, and that he had not purposely attempted to end his life; a poem left by Helen had implored him not to die until he had lived his life to the full, and he had resolved that to commit suicide would have meant letting her down. Although not conventionally religious, Cushing maintained a belief both in God and an afterlife. Cushing's colleagues of that period commented on his deeply Christian faith and his conviction that his separation from his wife was only temporary.|$|E
500|$|In mid-January, Danielle Savre {{was cast}} as the film's lead Laura Porter. On Savre, Betancourt stated that [...] " [...] has been {{incredible}} so far {{and has been a}} real trooper. We've [...] had her <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down these halls screaming, throwing blood on her, throwing vomit on her, throwing guts on her and she's held up so far." [...] Tobin Bell was cast as Dr. Mitchell Allen in February and Matt Cohen as Laura's brother Henry in March. Bell modeled his portrayal after Dick Cheney.|$|E
500|$|At 23:14, Muirhead-Gould {{ordered all}} ships to observe {{blackout}} conditions. Just after 23:30, {{he set off}} on a barge towards the boom net, to make a personal inspection. The Admiral reached Lolita at about midnight and indicated to her crew {{that he did not}} take the reports of enemy submarines seriously, reportedly saying: [...] "What are you all playing at, <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the harbour dropping depth charges and talking about enemy subs in the harbour? There's not one to be seen." [...] The crew reiterated that a submarine had been seen, but Muirhead-Gould remained unconvinced and before he left, added sarcastically: [...] "If you see another sub, see if the captain has a black beard. I'd like to meet him." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1847, Brannan {{opened a}} store at Sutter's Fort, in present-day Sacramento, California. During {{that time he}} also built many large {{buildings}} in both Sacramento and San Francisco. Early in 1848, employees of John Sutter paid for goods in Brannan's store with gold they had found at Sutter's Mill, near Coloma, California. His California Star paper could not publish {{the news of the}} gold strike as the staff had left in a rush for the gold fields. Yet he [...] "owned the only store between San Francisco and the gold fields -- a fact he capitalized on by buying up all the picks, shovels and pans he could find, and then <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the streets of San Francisco, shouting [...] "Gold! Gold on the American River!" [...] He paid 20 cents each for the pans, then sold them for $15 apiece. In nine weeks, he made $36,000." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim {{was born}} at 8 Fishguard Street, Everton, Liverpool and was the third eldest of seven {{children}}. The McCartney children were John (Jack), Edith, James (Jim), Ann, Millie, Jane (Jin) and Joe (who was named after a brother who died in infancy). Joe and Florrie McCartney moved shortly after Jim's birth to 3 Solva Street in Everton, which was a run-down terraced house about three-quarters of {{a mile from the}} Liverpool city centre, where Jim attended the Steers Street Primary School off Everton Road. After leaving school at 14, Jim found work for six shillings a week as a cotton [...] "sample boy", at A. Hanney & Co.; a cotton broker in Chapel Street, Liverpool. Jim's job entailed <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down Old Hall Street with large bundles of cotton that had to be delivered to cotton brokers or merchants in various salesrooms. He worked ten-hour days, five days a week, although he received a bonus at Christmas that was almost double his annual salary.|$|E
500|$|The Old Stone House (3051 M Street NW) {{was built}} in 1765 by Christopher and Rachel Layman. The house was sold in 1767 to a wealthy widow, Cassandra Chew, who {{constructed}} a kitchen in the rear in 1767, and a second floor between 1767 and 1775, and a third floor in the 1790s. It remained in private hands for almost two centuries, used as a home and place of business, until the federal government purchased it in 1953 [...] An exceptionally large number of spirits, residents and visitors claim, inhabit the small house. These include: A woman in a brown dress standing near the fireplace, a heavy-set woman standing on the staircase {{and also in the}} kitchen, a man with long blond hair and wearing a blue jacket, a man wearing short pants and long stockings, a woman in a rocking chair on the third floor, a small boy who runs down the third floor hallway, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing standing in the master bedroom, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing seen on the second floor, a young girl with curly hair <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the staircase, an African American boy, and a German-looking craftsman. The laughter of invisible children and the translucent images of women cooking in the kitchen have also been observed. The Old Stone House may also contain one of Washington's only malevolent spirits, nicknamed [...] "George," [...] who has choked and pushed visitors and whose presence (often indicated by an extremely cold spot) leaves witnesses with an intense feeling of dread. The hauntings at the Old Stone House are so well known that they were mentioned in Sandi Wilson's short crime story, [...] "The Blonde in Black." ...|$|E

2500|$|At this, Karolina {{ran from}} the funeral parlor {{screaming}} [...] "My Elsie is dead. She was murdered, murdered." [...] Her husband and Det. Zelasky tried to calm her, but in her extreme distress she began <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the street, drawing a crowd of curious onlookers. She insisted she had known for three weeks that the [...] "gypsies" [...] had killed Elsie. Frank consoled her and assisted her boarding a trolley car for home.|$|E
2500|$|In the European Mountain Running Trophy, {{her best}} {{results have been}} as runner up in Bad Kleinkirchheim, Carinthia, Austria in 1999, which she {{repeated}} in 2001 in Slovenia, finishing behind Russian Svetlana Demidenko, and again in 2003 in Trento, Italy, when Belgium's Catherine Lallemand won. She won the women's World Mountain Running Trophy in Bergen, Germany against expectations in 2000; as with all even-numbered years, the Trophy race followed the international style, which typically only involves an ascent. Mudge is more experienced in British fell-running, which includes <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down hills, but found success despite being unable to exploit her greater descending experience. Mudge herself described the WMRT win as [...] "the pinnacle of my career" [...] in a June 2008 interview.|$|E
2500|$|Just before 11 on {{the night}} of August 8, 1898, Lt. Atwater thought he saw moving figures in white, {{on the edge of the}} woods 250 yards from the lighthouse. At 1145, with {{moonlight}} breaking through the clouds, he saw several men in the brush on the edge of the woods. Without giving an alarm, he instructed the lookouts to be on heightened vigilance. As he was heading to the yard gate to order the corporal of the guard and sentry to come inside the light-house, those men came <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> announced they had seen Spanish troops in the road. Almost immediately, a volley of gunfire erupted from the surrounding woods. [...] Atwater ordered the lighthouse lamp doused as a signal to the three armed ships lying offshore that the light-house was under attack. The cruiser, , the only ship with an operable searchlight, trained it on the hill where the lighthouse sat in order to direct secondary battery gunfire from Cincinnati, Amphitrite and Leyden on the attacking Spanish troops.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Doctor's Daughter" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews. David Chater of The Times {{described it}} as [...] "A wonderful episode - funny, exciting and strangely moving." [...] Martin Anderson of Den of Geek! stated that it was [...] "rather good - though badly plot-holed". He noted that it was yet another episode of Doctor Who [...] "undermined by Murray Gold's incessant music". He also described the episode as [...] "quite redolent of Tom Baker-era Who, with plenty of dark and cheap corridors to run down and two under-manned warring factions for the Doctor to bring peace to". For SFX's Ian Berriman, the <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down corridors was reminiscent of Lenny Henry's 1985 Doctor Who spoof featured on The Lenny Henry Show. Berriman described the episode as [...] "underwhelming", citing that because one [...] "always suspect she's a redshirt" [...] {{it is difficult to}} care for Jenny. Although [...] "reasonably diverting", Berriman argues that budgetary constraints make [...] "the story feel so enclosed" [...] and that the episode's plot, likened to [...] "", seems too {{similar to that of the}} Sontaran two-parter immediately prior to this adventure because both involve [...] "militarism" [...] and [...] "cloning". Newsrounds Lizo Mzimba also notes the similarities with [...] "The Sontaran Stratagem" [...] and [...] "The Poison Sky". Mzimba asserts that the episode's [...] "biggest problem" [...] is that it tries [...] "to cram an enormous amount into 45 minutes" [...] with most of the [...] "interesting" [...] and new ideas not getting [...] "the attention they deserve" [...] resulting in the audience not caring about either the human fighters or the Hath and thereby limiting a [...] "sense of danger or menace".|$|E
