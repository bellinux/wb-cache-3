5|$|The {{scholarly}} {{study of}} music in the United States includes work relating music to social class, racial, ethnic and <b>religious</b> <b>identity,</b> gender and sexuality, as well as studies of music history, musicology, and other topics. The academic study of American music {{can be traced back}} to the late 19th century, when researchers like Alice Fletcher and Francis La Flesche studied the music of the Omaha peoples, working for the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. In the 1890s and into the early 20th century, musicological recordings were made among indigenous, Hispanic, African-American and Anglo-American peoples of the United States. Many worked for the Library of Congress, first under the leadership of Oscar Sonneck, chief of the Library's Music Divisions. These researchers included Robert W. Gordon, founder of the Archive of American Folk Song, and John and Alan Lomax; Alan Lomax was the most prominent of several folk song collectors who helped to inspire the 20th century roots revival of American folk culture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this article is to acquaint the broader pub-lic opinion {{research}} audience with what has been a salient issue within the community of scholars of religion. We address the question of how best to conceptualize and measure <b>religious</b> <b>identities</b> in research on contemporary American society. We consider the main approaches to the measurement of religious identification with regard to their back-grounds, their assumptions about the importance of understanding <b>religious</b> <b>identities</b> in historically relevant terms, and the practical con-siderations of survey measurement. Using data from the General Social Survey, particularly recent innovative efforts to obtain information on subjective association with particular religious traditions and/or move-ments (e. g., Pentecostal, fundamentalist, evangelical, mainline, or liberal Protestant), we compare the two main approaches: the traditional “denominational ” approach, where <b>religious</b> <b>identities</b> are assumed to be associated with religious denominations, and the subjectiv...|$|R

40|$|While a {{large body}} of {{research}} has established that there is substantial prejudice against atheists and nonreligious individuals, both in the US and in other countries where nonreligious people are minorities, to date very little research has looked beyond attitudes toward solitary identities (e. g., “atheists” vs. “gay atheists”). Given the growing recognition of the importance of intersectionality in understanding the experiences of minorities, in this article we examined attitudes toward intersected identities, combining five (non) <b>religious</b> <b>identities</b> (i. e., Christian, Jewish, Muslim, atheist, and nonreligious) with four sexual/gender identities (i. e., heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transgender) using a 100 -point thermometer scale (N = 618). We found that sexual/gender identities were more influential in ordering the results than were <b>religious</b> <b>identities,</b> with heterosexual individuals being rated most positively, followed for the most part by: homosexual, bisexual, and then transgender individuals. However, within the sexual/gender identities, (non) religion ordered the results; Christians and Jewish individuals rated most highly among heterosexuals while nonreligious and atheist individuals rated most highly among transgender individuals. We suggest these results indicate that people believe minority sexual/gender identities “taint” or “pollute” <b>religious</b> <b>identities,</b> unless those <b>religious</b> <b>identities</b> are already perceived as tainted, as is the case for atheists and the nonreligious...|$|R
40|$|The paper interrogates the {{literature}} on online cultural and <b>religious</b> <b>identities</b> through a critical engagement of Stuart Hall 2 ̆ 7 s work on new ethnicity and regimes of representation. It suggests that this literature conflates Hall 2 ̆ 7 s notion of ‘new ethnicity’ with one that argues that online cultural and <b>religious</b> <b>identities</b> are ‘new’ because of transnational and global processes, the pervasiveness of computer-mediated communication and the global mobility of immigrants. Thus, current research on online ethnic and <b>religious</b> <b>identities</b> underestimates the complexity of Hall 2 ̆ 7 s concept and to highlight this complexity we ponder {{the extent to which}} new online ethnicities – as expressed in the current literature – reflect, construct or renegotiate so-called offline ethnicities. The paper concludes that online ethnic subjectivities, while providing alternative representations to counteract the dominant racist discourse within host societies, still reflect mimic essentialist voices. <br /...|$|R

A mixed-methods research approach was used to measure Black women’s ability to reconcile their racial and <b>religious</b> <b>identities.</b> The data gathered enabled the researcher to broadly determine the degree to which reconciliation is achieved among Black LI) S women. The researcher found that the diminutive presence of the African-American religious aesthetic in the LDS Church did not considerably influence identity reconciliation among Black LDS women. This finding is significant as it will help to inform future studies about identity reconciliation among Black people who join historically White religious institutions as well as the viability of the Black Church as a resource for spiritual and racial identity cultivation among Black people...|$|R
