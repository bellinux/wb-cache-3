It was followed in 2006 by a collection of his press articles, carrying the title Democrație și memorie ("Democracy and Memory"), which centers on admiring portraits: those of thinkers, politicians or activists whom he credits with having provided him {{with an understanding of}} political phenomenons—Raymond Aron, Robert Conquest, Arthur Koestler, Jacek Kuroń, Czesław Miłosz, Susan Sontag, Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev—and those of Cold War figures such as US President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II. The book also included his earlier calls to have the Securitate archives, then managed by the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Service,</b> opened for the public, in the belief that liberal democracy has transparency as its prerequisite. Other segments of the book voiced calls for a public debate on the moral legacy of communism, and for the assumption of the [...] "democratic ethos" [...] by regular Romanians.|$|E

40|$|This paper advocates the {{introduction}} of the concept of <b>intelligence</b> in the <b>Romanian</b> language, in order to fill the current methodological gap. The need for a new concept emerged in the activity of <b>Romanian</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>services</b> over a decade ago, when „intelligence” started to be used in parallel with „information” in external and internal missions. Our approach is focused on three dimensions, which we consider fundamental for our demarche: formulating a definition of intelligence, establishing its position in relation with other key-concepts from the cognitive field: data, information, intelligence and knowledge and underlining the differences between the four and finally making a brief presentation of the intelligence types, both in the military and intelligence field, and its extension to the business and academic sector in {{the last two or three}} decades...|$|R

He was adored by the public as an amateur wrestler and bullfighter at the Sidoli Circus, but also translated for Russian trading posts. In one instance, when Cătărău resolved his financial difficulties by turning to unskilled manual labor, Iorga and the students popularized his plight and collected funds in his name.

5000|$|As Antonescu {{was overthrown}} by {{opposition}} forces during the August 23 coup, Killinger, still present in Bucharest, {{committed suicide in}} his office on Calea Victoriei {{in order to avoid}} capture by the Red Army.

However this event is not recorded anywhere else, and has to the viewed as a rumor.In testimonies he gave after being captured by the Western Allies, Walter Schellenberg, the last chief of the German Intelligence Organization (Abwehr), indicated that Killinger and Joachim von Ribbentrop's reports from early 1944 had played a part in assuring German leaders that Romania was under control. This came despite repeated warnings issued by Eugen Cristescu, head of the <b>Romanian</b> Special <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Service.</b> Reflecting on the sequence of events, he indicated his belief that Killinger [...] "was certainly not quite normal".|$|R
