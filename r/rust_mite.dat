50|$|Abacarus hystrix (cereal <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> or grain <b>rust</b> <b>mite)</b> {{belongs to}} the family Eriophyidae. They are {{extremely}} small with adults measuring up to one millimeter in length and only have four legs {{at the front of}} the body. Viewing by the human eye requires, a 10 - 20X lens. The adult mites are usually yellow but also have been seen to be white or orange. The cereal <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> was first found on Elymus repens (couch grass), a very common perennial grass species. It has now been found on more than 60 grass species including oats, barley, wheat and ryegrass, found in Europe, North America, South Africa and Australia. Mites migrate primarily through wind movement and are usually found on the highest basal sections of the top two leaf blades. Abacarus hystrix produces up to twenty overlapping generations per year in South Australian perennial pastures, indicating that the species breeds quite rapidly. It has been noted that the cereal <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> can cause losses in yield of up to 30-70%.|$|E

40|$|Although odour-mediated {{interactions}} among plants, spider mites and predatory mites have been extensively studied above-ground, belowground studies {{are in their}} infancy. In this paper, we investigate whether feeding by <b>rust</b> <b>mites</b> (Aceria tulipae) cause tulip bulbs to produce odours that attract predatory mites (Neoseiulus cucumeris). Since {{our aim was to}} demonstrate such odours and not their relevance under soil conditions, the experiments were carried out using a classic Y-tube olfactometer in which the predators moved on a Y-shaped wire in open air. We found that food-deprived female predators can discriminate between odours from infested bulbs and odours from uninfested bulbs or artificially wounded bulbs. No significant difference in attractiveness to predators was found between clean bulbs and bulbs either wounded 30 ?min or 3 ?h before the experiment. These results indicate that it may not be simply the wounding of the bulbs, but rather the feeding by <b>rust</b> <b>mites,</b> which causes the bulb to release odours that attract N. cucumeris. Since bulbs are belowground plant structures, the olfactometer results demonstrate the potential for odour-mediated interactions in the soil. However, their importance in the actual soil medium remains to be demonstrated...|$|R
25|$|Acarines live in {{practically}} every habitat, and include aquatic (freshwater and sea water) and terrestrial species. They outnumber other arthropods {{in the soil}} organic matter and detritus. Many are parasitic, and they affect both vertebrates and invertebrates. Most parasitic forms are external parasites, while the free living forms are generally predaceous and may even be used to control undesirable arthropods. Others are detritivores that help to break down forest litter and dead organic matter such as skin cells. Others still are plant feeders and may damage crops. Damage to crops {{is perhaps the most}} costly economic effect of mites, especially by the spider mites and their relatives (Tetranychoidea), earth mites (Penthaleidae), thread-footed mites (Tarsonemidae) and the gall and <b>rust</b> <b>mites</b> (Eriophyoidea). Some parasitic forms affect humans and other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, and can even be vectors of diseases such as scrub typhus and rickettsial pox. A well-known effect of mites on humans is their role as an allergen and the stimulation of asthma in people affected by the respiratory disease. The use of predatory mites (e.g. Phytoseiidae) in pest control and herbivorous mites that attack weeds is also important. An unquantified, but major positive contribution of the Acari is their normal functioning in ecosystems, especially their roles in the decomposer subsystem.|$|R
50|$|Cereal <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> {{eggs are}} {{exceptionally}} small and {{are placed in}} leaf vein grooves by the mite. The eggs usually begin hatching {{at the beginning of}} spring (March in the Northern Hemisphere and September in the Southern Hemisphere) and once they have reached the juvenile stage, the mites mature very quickly (16-18 days). Once the mites are at the adult stage they often travel to the lower section of the plant where they feed on young tissues. Mites are always present for the full growing season of the plant, but activity has been seen to decrease as the temperature begins to rise, this is because unlike other mite species the cereal <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> favors much cooler temperatures.|$|E

40|$|In {{the middle}} of the last century, mites moved into the focus of {{attention}} as pests relevantto agriculture, forestry and landscape horticulture, presumably in direct reactionto the “green revolution” that involved plant cultivation in large-plot monocropping systems,improved methods of cultivation, selection of high-yielding cultivars and intensifieduse of pesticides and mineral fertilizers. Agroecosystems in which phytophagous miteshave become harmful organisms are primarily orchards, vineyards, greenhouses, urbangreeneries, plant nurseries and stored plant products, as well as annual field crops to asomewhat lesser degree. Phytophagous mite species belong to a variety of spider mites(Tetranychidae), false spider mites (Tenuipalpidae), gall and <b>rust</b> <b>mites</b> (Eriophyoidae), tarsonemidmites (Tarsonemidae) and acarid mites (Acaridae). Most of these harmful speciesare widespread, some of them having more economic impact than others and being moredetrimental as depending on various specificities of each outdoor agroecosystem in anyparticular climatic region. The first segment of this overview focuses on the most significant mite pests ofagroecosystemsand urban horticultural areas in European countries, our own region andin Serbia today, primarily on species that have caused problems in recent years regardingplant production, and it also discusses various molecular methods available for investigatingdifferent aspects of the biology of phytophagous mites.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 A study {{consisting}} of three parts was undertaken to investigate how variation in species interactions, population genetic structure, epidemiological parameters, and plant breeding system {{may influence the}} ecology and biological control of an apomictic invasive plant, Chondrilla juncea (Asteraceae). Interactions between natural enemy species may modify their net effect on host plants, but {{little research has been}} done to examine how plant resistance influences species interactions in biological weed control. First, we performed common garden experiments with clonal accessions of C. juncea to compare a rust-susceptible weed biotype with a rust-resistant biotype, both of which are invasive in western North America. Inoculations with two biological control organisms, a rust fungus pathogen (Puccinia chondrillina) and an eriophyid gall mite (Eriophyes chondrillae), were applied separately and in combination to test if plant performance is modified by antagonistic or facilitative species interactions. We found no significant <b>rust</b> x <b>mite</b> interaction effects for several plant traits (shoot length, shoot dry biomass, fecundity, rosette growth, and rosette senescence), and therefore the two natural enemies appear to have independent and complementary effects on plant performance. However, rust inoculation reduced the total dry biomass of mite galls in the rust-susceptible biotype by indirect competition due to decreased growth of diseased shoots, but not in the rust-resistant biotype. Our results indicate that rust disease may have the potential to modify mite gall epidemiology and relative plant performance in mixed populations of resistant and susceptible C. juncea biotypes. In {{the second part of the}} study, a monitoring survey of C. juncea was conducted in southwest Oregon during 2006 to investigate natural associations in the distribution of damage caused by P. chondrillina, E. chondrillae, and the cecidomyiid gall midge Cystiphora schmidti. Mite galling was the most aggregated type of damage both within and among field sites. Analysis of an allometric relationship of shoot growth (biomass versus stem area) indicates that rust disease reduced C. juncea growth but only at high stand density, and in general rust disease was the most randomly distributed type of damage within sites. There was no evidence from the field survey to support a species interaction between the gall <b>mite</b> and the <b>rust</b> pathogen, but negative associations were detected between midge galling and the damage caused by both of the other natural enemies, which may indicate species interaction via <b>rust</b> and/or <b>mite</b> interference with C. schmidti oviposition. However, this potential antagonism was found only at high stand density with relatively high levels of damage caused by each natural enemy, and so the overall impact of biological control probably is not strongly diminished by enemy interference. The third part of the study was a mathematical model of inheritance and genetic equilibrium in meiotic diplospory, which is an unusual mechanism of gametophytic apomixis occurring in invasive populations of C. juncea and also in triploid dandelions (Taraxacum officinale). Crossing-over during prophase I of meiotic diplospory has the potential to generate genotypic diversity in apomictic lineages because it involves homologous recombination without fertilization ("subsexual reproduction"). I developed a stage-structured matrix model of inheritance in subsexual reproduction using a wide range of probabilities for recombination and mutation to assess the range of equilibrium conditions under which genotypic diversity is stable in obligately apomictic lines. The analysis supports predictions of genotypic diversity when rates of crossing-over and mutation are not highly imbalanced. Therefore subsexual reproduction remains mathematically plausible as a contributing factor to the quantitative variation in disease resistance and ecological traits of invasive C. juncea found in this study and others...|$|R
40|$|Acaricides {{are one of}} the {{cornerstones}} of {{an efficient}} control program for phytophagous mites. An analysis of the global acaricide market reveals that spider mites such as Tetranychus urticae, Panonychus citri and Panonychus ulmi are by far the most economically important species, representing more than 80 % of the market. Other relevant mite groups are false spider <b>mites</b> (mainly Brevipalpus), <b>rust</b> and gall <b>mites</b> and tarsonemid mites. Acaricides are most frequently used in vegetables and fruits (74 % of the market), including grape vines and citrus. However, their use is increasing in major crops where spider mites are becoming more important, such as soybean, cotton and corn. As revealed by a detailed case study of the Japanese market, major shifts in acaricide use are partially driven by resistance development and the commercial availability of compounds with novel mode of action. The importance of the latter cannot be underestimated, although some compounds are successfully used for more than 30 years. A review of recent developments in mode of action research is presented, as such knowledge is important for devising resistance management programs. This includes spirocyclic keto-enols as inhibitors of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the carbazate bifenazate as a mitochondrial complex III inhibitor, a novel class of complex II inhibitors, and the mite growth inhibitors hexythiazox, clofentezine and etoxazole that interact with chitin synthase I...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to causing phyllody itself, insects and other ectoparasites {{also serve as}} disease vectors that can spread phyllody to other nearby plants. The most common of these insect vectors are leafhoppers, an example of which is Hishimonus phycitis, which transmits the phytoplasma-caused little leaf phyllody in eggplants. The broken-backed bug (Taylorilygus apicalis) is another insect vector of a phytoplasma-caused phyllody in species of Parthenium. Other ectoparasite vectors include eriophyid mites, like the rose leaf curl mite (Phyllocoptes fructiplilus) which {{is known to be}} the primary vector of the rose rosette disease; and the chrysanthemum <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> (Paraphytoptus chrysanthemi) which transmits phytoplasma-caused phyllody in species of chrysanthemums.|$|E

40|$|Mites are {{microscopic}} arthropods {{that are}} {{classified in the}} order Acarina. They are not insects but are related to ticks and spiders. There are over 40, 000 described species of mites in the world. Some of them live freely in soil or water; some are found on plants and some are associated with other animals. Due to their small size {{most of them are}} difficult to see with the naked eye. Mites that are plant pests include spider mites (family Tetranychidae), false spider mites (family Tenuipalpidae), tarsonemid mites (family Tarsonemidae) and the <b>rust</b> or gall <b>mites</b> (family Eriophyidae). These mites cause damage by piercing plant cells and sucking out their contents. In heavy infestations mites may even kill the host plant. Spider mites are given their name as they often spin characteristic protective silk webs. This family has more than 1000 species, which include some species of quarantine importance, and many species that may cause heavy losses to major food crops and ornamental plants. These include the infamous two-spotted mites Tetranychus urticae, and other major economic spider mite pests, which have been recorded in the Northern Territory e. g. oriental red mite, Eutetranychus orientalis- primarily a pest of citrus; vegetable spider mite, Tetranychus neocaledonicus; and avocado brown mite, Oligonychus punicae.

To investigate which selection pressures may have moulded prey preference in an acarine system consisting of two prey species and three predator species, we tested whether prey preference of the predators is matched by the associated reproductive success. The predators involved areAmblyseius finlandicus (Oudemans),Am. potentillae (Garman) andTyphlodromus pyri Scheuten. The prey species are the apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> (Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa)) and the {{fruit-tree red spider mite}} (Panonychus ulmi (Koch)). Reproductive success was assessed in terms of intrinsic rate of increase and for one predator also in terms of diapause induction. All three predator species reached highest reproductive success on the same prey species: apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite.</b> This was most pronounced for the predatorAm. finlandicus, because its larval stage suffered severe mortality when feeding onP. ulmi. An independent study on prey preference of the three predator species (Dicke et al., 1988) revealed thatAm. finlandicus prefersAc. schlechtendali toP. ulmi, whereas the other two predator species have the reverse preference. Thus, on the basis of current data, prey preference ofAm. finlandicus can be understood in terms of reproductive success. However, this is not so for prey preference ofT. pyri andAm. potentillae.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pesticides}} used against codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., on integrated mite management was studied {{for three years}} in five or six commercial apple orchards in central Washington. Phytophagous and predatory mites were counted throughout the season in blocks ranging from 0. 4 - 1. 6 ha in size treated with four codling moth insecti-cides. In one year of the study (2006), five out of six orchards experienced elevated mite densities relative to the standard. In four orchards, novaluron caused a 3. 0 - 16. 9 × in-crease in mite populations; acetamiprid caused a 2. 6 - 3. 4 × increase, and thiacloprid caused a 1. 7 - 13. 8 × increase. In the fifth orchard, the organophosphate standard had an extremely high mite population, {{in addition to all}} three experimental treatments. In 2005 and 2007, only one or two orchards had elevated mite levels in the novaluron, acetami-prid, and thiacloprid treatments. Additive effects of codling moth and thinning programs were evaluated in small plot research trials. Treatments with all three elements [1) cod-ling moth insecticide; 2) calcium polysulfide; 3) carbaryl] produced the highest levels of spider mites. Three sulfur-containing products (calcium polysulfide, ammonium thiosul-fate, and dry flowable sulfur) were evaluated for their effect on Galandromus occiden-talis (Nesbitt) and apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite,</b> Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa). All three materials caused suppressed G. occidentalis numbers. Calcium polysulfide caused the greatest reduction in apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> numbers, ammonium thiosulfate the least reduction, with dry flowable sulfur intermediate between the two. Additive effects of codling moth ma-terials, carbaryl, and sulfur-containing products may be causing increased mite levels in Washington orchards...|$|E

A rapid method for extracting eriophyoid mites was adapted from earlier studies to provide integrated pest management (IPM) consultants and commercial growers with a practical, efficient, and reliable tool to monitor grape rust mites in vineyards and nursery stock vines. The rinse in bag (RIB) method allows quick extraction of mites from young shoots or from leaves using 35...|$|E
