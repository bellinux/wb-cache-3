None {{of the children who}} developed dysimmunoglobulinemia during treatment showed clinical symptoms of this adverse event, in particular none developed severe infections. All patients regained normal immunoglobulin levels after discontinuing SSZ treatment. One patient with a partial IgA deficiency at the start of SSZ treatment showed a slow increase in the IgA level during treatment. During follow-up (4 - 6 years), one patient spontaneously developed a dysimmunoglobulinemia and one patient developed diabetes mellitus. Based on these case <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> of the literature we advocate monitoring of serum immunoglobulin levels while on SSZ treatment...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The smoking {{rate among}} {{patients}} {{with mental health}} problem is {{higher than in the}} general population. Effective pharmacotherapy to treat nicotine addiction is thus needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with cigarette smoking among these patients. This article reviews the literature on the suitability of varenicline for smokers with mental health problems. Methods: A search of the literature was conducted using PubMed from year 2001 to July 2009 using key words varenicline alone and varenicline and mental health. Articles chosen were narrowed to those published in English. The type of articles chosen included clinical trials, metaanalyses, case <b>reports,</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> articles. Results: The search produced a total of 322 articles on varenicline and 14 articles on varenicline and mental health.

40|$|Hypoxic regions {{have been}} {{identified}} within tumors and its presence {{has been linked to}} malignant progression, metastasis, resistance to therapy, and poor clinical outcomes following treatment. Acute and chronic hypoxia are integral components of tumor microenvironment and conduce to metabolic adaptations of tumor cells leading to genetic instability, intratumor heterogeneity and malignant progression. On the success of our fight against cancer, the continued adaptability of tumors to their microenvironmental stresses, such as hypoxia, must be considered. Tumor cells are endowed with a very high plasticity and capacity to adapt. It is our challenge to find populations and conditions of the tumor microenvironment germane for target success. Interdisciplinary work will be the key for achievement of these goals. This e-book is a compendium of original <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> articles contributed by world-class experts in the field of tumor hypoxia. This material will be useful to foster discussion and increase understanding of the involvement of hypoxia in tumorigenesis, biomarker development, and therapeutics.

40|$|Background: Daptomycin is used {{increasingly}} to treat prosthetic joint infection (PJI). A possible {{side effect of}} this drug is eosinophilic pneumonia. We describe two patients with PJI treated with daptomycin who had this side effect with different clinical presentations. METHODS: Case <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> of the literature. RESULTS: The first case was a 64 -year-old male who received daptomycin {{as a part of}} the treatment for PJI caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). He developed fever without other symptoms; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed eosinophils. The second was a 61 -year-old male who also used daptomycin as part of the treatment of PJI caused by MRSE and developed severe lung symptoms. Bronchoalveolar lavage and pleural fluid showed an increased number of eosinophils. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin-induced pneumonia can present with a wide range of symptoms, from fever alone to severe lung symptoms. Surgeons should be aware of this possible side effect when prescribing daptomycin...|$|E

40|$|Early {{clinical}} {{development of}} paclitaxel was complicated by life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) manifested by hypotension, dyspnoea, angiooedema and urticaria. Prolongation of paclitaxel infusion time and empiric pretreatment with steroids, H 1 -antagonists and H 2 -antagonists were introduced based on similar regimens that had proven useful in preventing reactions to radiographic contrast media. This regimen {{has led to}} a reduction in incidence of HSRs and successful retreatment of patients with prior HSRs to paclitaxel. However, the actual benefit of an H 2 -antagonist, such as ranitidine, in the premedication regimen is questionable and may even increase HSRs. On the basis of two case <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> of literature data, the use of ranitidine in prophylaxis of HSRs should be revised and carefully evaluated in clinical practice. Randomized controlled clinical trials need to be performed to address the benefit of H 2 -antagonists in preventing HSRs...|$|E
