50|$|Castor oil is {{well known}} {{as a source of}} <b>ricinoleic</b> <b>acid,</b> a monounsaturated, 18-carbon fatty acid. Among fatty acids, <b>ricinoleic</b> <b>acid</b> is unusual in that it has a {{hydroxyl}} functional group on the 12th carbon. This functional group causes <b>ricinoleic</b> <b>acid</b> (and castor oil) to be more polar than most fats. The chemical reactivity of the alcohol group also allows chemical derivatization that is not possible with most other seed oils. Because of its <b>ricinoleic</b> <b>acid</b> content, castor oil is a valuable chemical in feedstocks, commanding a higher price than other seed oils. As an example, in July 2007, Indian castor oil sold for about US$0.90 per kilogram (US$0.41 per pound) whereas U.S. soybean, sunflower and canola oils sold for about US$0.30 per kilogram (US$0.14 per pound).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate botanical oils, mineral oils and an insecticide that contained azadirachtin (ICA) for the control of Hypothenemus hampei, in addition to the effects of residual castor oil. We evaluated the effectiveness of the vegetable oils of canola, sunflower, corn, soybean and castor, two mineral oils (assist(r) and naturol(r)), and the ICA for the control of H. hampei. The compounds were tested at a concentration of 3. 0 % (v v- 1). The median lethal concentration (LC 50) was estimated with Probit analysis. The oil of castor bean and extract of castor bean cake were also evaluated at concentrations of 3. 0 % (v v- 1) and 3. 0 % (m v- 1), respectively. The mortality rates for H. hampei caused by the ICA and the castor oil were 40. 8 and 53. 7 %, with LC 50 values of 6. 71 and 3. 49 % (v v- 1), respectively. In the castor oil, the methyl esters of the fatty acids were palmitic (1. 10 %), linoleic (4. 50 %), oleic (4. 02 %), stearic (0. 50 %) and <b>ricinoleic</b> <b>acids</b> (88. 04 %). The extract of the castor bean cake was not toxic to H. hampei. The persistence of the castor oil in the environment was low, and the cause of mortality for H. hampei was most likely the blockage of the spiracles, which prevented the insects from breathing...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate, the phytochemical composition of leaves and roots of five Tunisian populations of castor (Ricinus communis L.). Levels of total phenolic contents, total flavonoids, and condensed tannins of methanolic extracts were determined by UV-spectrophotometer. Phenolic compounds were identified and quantified by RP-HPLC (reverse phase HPLC). Gentisic acid, catechin, rutin, vanillic acid, vitexin, and gallic acid were detected. GCMS analysis that uses the FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) method in castor oils revealed the existence of palmitic, stearic, oleic, gondoic, linoleic, and <b>ricinoleic</b> <b>acids.</b> The antioxidant properties of leaves, roots, and oils of castor using the DPPH radical scavenging capacity assays. The study showed a high antioxidant capacity which was expressed by a very low IC 50 values for the leaves extracts: Hammamet (0. 65 mu g/ml), Aouled Amer (2. 42 mu g/ml), Riadh Andalous (2. 34 mu g/ml), Nefza (3. 91 mu g/ml), and Khanguet Hajej (2. 39 mu g/ml).

The LC 50 values for the seed extracts were low: Aouled Amer (570 mg/l), Nefza (603 mg/l), Khanguet Hajej (1260 mg/l), Riadh Andalous (1225 mg/l), and Hammamet (2140 mg/l). This study permits to exhibit two positive correlation relationships: the first one between the total phenolic compounds, total flavonoid compounds, and the antioxidant activities of leaves and roots extracts, and the second one between the antioxidant activity and the larvicidal activity of the leaves extracts...|$|R
40|$|Castor {{seed oil}} (Ricinus communis) is a {{prominent}} feed stock towards {{the generation of}} renewable materials for industrial production. The reach presence of <b>ricinoleic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> at 87. 5 % provides pendant hydroxyl functional groups, which is an essential site for chemical formulations. This paper presents the synthesis, characterization, and evaluations on antibacterial and anticorrosive activities of synthesized hybrid composites from Ricinus communis seed oil. N,N'-bis(2 -hydroxy ethyl) - 12 -hydroxy Ricinus communis oil fatty amide (HERCA) was synthesized via aminolysis polyol formation route. Upon reacting HERCA with succinic acid at a high temperature of about 145 oC, a polyesteramide (RCPEA) was formed. This ester product undergoes urethanation and subsequently interfaced with modified hybrid material. The synthesized composites were characterized using spectroscopic methods such as FT- IR, 1 H-NMR, and 13 C-NMR. Selected physicochemical parameters were also carried out on the products.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{extraction}} of castor oil using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2). The response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to show explicitly {{the influence of the}} process parameters such as temperature, pressure and CO 2 flow rate on the oil yield using the Box-Behnken design. The linear terms of pressure, CO 2 flow rate and temperature, and the quadratic terms of temperature, pressure and CO 2 flow rate had a significant effect on the oil yield. The maximum oil yield obtained from the mathematical model was predicted to be 9. 29 % under the conditions of temperature at 63. 7 °C and pressure of 29. 9 MPa with CO 2 flow rate of 4. 15 mL/min. Comparing the oil yield with the conventional soxhlet extraction, yields of 59. 8 %, 52. 3 % and 49. 9 % were obtained using ethanol, n-hexane and petroleum ether as solvents for optimized average particle sizes and extraction times of 1. 30 mm and 2. 88 h, 1. 26 mm and 2. 65 h and 1. 25 mm and 2. 55 h, respectively. In addition, the solubility of castor oil was measured at temperatures ranging from 313 to 335 K, and pressures 20 to 36 MPa, respectively. The measured solubilities ranged from 1. 00 × 10 - 3 to 4. 88 × 10 - 3 g of oil/g of CO 2. The measurements confirmed that temperature and pressure have direct effects on solubilityenhancement factors. Five semi-empirical models were tested for correlating the experimental data from SC-CO 2 extraction: the Chrastil, Del Valle Aguilera (VA), Bartle, Kumar and Johnston (KJ) and Mendez-Santiago and Teja (MST) models. The solubilities from these models had the following average absolute relative deviations (AARD%) from experimental data: 0. 05 % (Chrastil), 0. 30 % (VA), 0. 38 % (Bartle), 5. 98 % (KJ) and 28. 5 % (MST). Thus, the Chrastil, VA and Bartle models correlated to the castor oil solubility data with the lowest AARD%. The physico-chemical properties of the seed oil extracted using the SC-CO 2 and soxhlet methods were determined. Palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic and <b>ricinoleic</b> <b>acids</b> were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis after the formation of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). For oxidation stability, castor oils derived from these extraction methods were heated in an oven at 70 °C for 0 – 12 weeks. The quality and oxidative stability of oil recovered by SC-CO 2 were generally found to be better than that recovered by the soxhlet method. In addition, the parameters considered in this study, namely peroxide value, refractive index, pH, conductivity, acid value and free fatty acid offer an appropriate tool for evaluating the quality of castor oil during storage as well as its oxidative stability; the study also sheds light on the different responses of castor oil during storage...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of functionalization degree on the thermogravimetric and rheological behaviour of NCO-functionalized chitosan- and chitin-based oleogels. Chitosan and chitin were functionalized using different proportions of 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) and subsequently dispersed in castor oil to promote the chemical reaction between the –NCO group of the modified biopolymer and the –OH group located in the <b>ricinoleic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> chain of castor oil, thus resulting in different oleogels with specific thermogravimetric and rheological characteristics. Biopolymers and oleogels were characterized through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) measurements were performed on the oleogels. Oleogels presented suitable thermal resistance, {{despite the fact that}} the inclusion of HMDI moieties in the polymer structure led to a reduction in the onset temperature of thermal degradation. The insertion of low amounts of HMDI in both chitin and chitosan produces a drastic reduction in the values of oleogel viscoelastic functions but, above a critical threshold, they increase with the functionalization degree so that isocyanate functionalization results in a chemical tool to modulate oleogel rheological response. Several NCO-functionalized chitosan- and chitin-based oleogel formulations present suitable thermal resistance and rheological characteristics to be proposed as bio-based alternatives to traditional lubricating greases.
