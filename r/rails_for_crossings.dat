50|$|Early toy trains {{used two}} metal rail tracks like most real trains.

Three rail contact also negates the need for insulated wheels, an important consideration before plastics became widely available.

50|$|The {{reference}} rail is {{the base}} rail {{that is used}} as a reference point for the measurement. It can vary in different countries. Most countries use one of the rails as the reference <b>rail.</b> <b>For</b> example, the United States uses the reference rail as the line rail which is the east rail of tangent track running north and south, the north rail of tangent track running east and west, the outer rail (the rail that is further away from the center) on curves, or the outside rails in multiple track territory. For Swiss railroad, the reference <b>rail</b> <b>for</b> tangent track is the center line between two rails, but it is the outside <b>rail</b> <b>for</b> curved track.|$|R
