40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical EngineeringWilliam KuhnQ-enhanced Filters {{have been}} {{researched}} extensively, {{but have not}} been often implemented into receiver architectures due to inherent challenges {{in the design and}} stability of these filters. However, recent works have successfully addressed Q-enhanced filter designs which are viable for receiver implementation with tuning algorithms to achieve temperature stability. This work continues these efforts with the redesign of a Two-Pole Q-Enhanced Band-Pass filter tested at narrower fractional bandwidths than previous work of less than one percent and considers potential significant improvements in receiver performance using this filer. The Q-enhanced filter redesign ports the existing filter to a new integrated circuit technology which performs better at higher frequencies. The redesign in particular addresses problems in the previous design. The frequency divider design is modified, resistance tuning is added, and additional modifications to the overall filter functionality are implemented. General problems in obtaining an ideal passband shape by eliminating unwanted coupling are addressed. The supporting software for the tuning algorithm is modified to use analog controls and shown to achieve further narrowed bandwidths of 5 MHz and 2. 5 MHz at center frequencies of 500 MHz, which are demonstrated to be temperature stable. Future software modifications are described to prepare the existing code base for the new filter design. Potential applications for a Q-enhanced filter include improving the performance of receiver designs. One of the most important performance parameters of a <b>receiver</b> is its <b>spurious</b> <b>response</b> rejection. To explore this behavior, an automated test system is developed to characterize receivers, and four receivers are tested. The test results are presented in a novel graphical display, which is used to evaluate receiver performance and compare receivers. These results motivated the development of a potential modified superheterodyne receiver architecture using the Q-enhanced filter as an image filter and an IF filter. The viability of this receiver design is tested and shown to provide significant improvements to <b>receiver’s</b> <b>spurious</b> rejection <b>response...</b>|$|R

The technique {{is based on}} two equivalent topologies of J-inverter and dual-line equivalent circuit of open-circuited stubs.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new capacitively stepped-impedance {{resonator}} (CSIR) {{is proposed}} {{to develop the}} microstrip square-loop dual-mode bandpass filter. Using this new design, simulta-neous size reduction and <b>spurious</b> <b>response</b> suppression for the dual-mode bandpass filter can be achieved. An analytical formu-lation of this novel resonator is given in order to elucidate the spu-rious frequencies relocation design. Together with this formula-tion, a generalized dual-mode bandpass filter model is developed so as to ease the analysis of transmission zero and insertion loss. A prototype filter is designed at 900 MHz with 1. 5 % fractional band-width. Significant spurious suppressions up to 33 and 35 dB are measured at 1. 8 and at 2. 7 GHz, respectively. A circuitry size re-duction of 54 % is achieved when {{compared with that of}} the con-ventional structure. Moreover, the CSIR allows frequency tuning and, thus, a varactor-tuned filter is designed and a measured tun-able center frequency between 1. 5 – 1. 62 GHz is demonstrated.

50|$|For {{crystals}} operated at series resonance or {{pulled away}} from the main mode by the inclusion of a series inductor or capacitor, significant (and temperature-dependent) <b>spurious</b> <b>responses</b> may be experienced. Though most spurious modes are typically some tens of kilohertz above the wanted series resonance their temperature coefficient is different from the main mode and the <b>spurious</b> <b>response</b> may move through the main mode at certain temperatures. Even if the series resistances at the spurious resonances appear higher than the one at wanted frequency a rapid change in the main mode series resistance can occur at specific temperatures when the two frequencies are coincidental.A consequence of these activity dips is that the oscillator may lock at a spurious frequency at specific temperatures. This is generally minimized by ensuring that the maintaining circuit has insufficient gain to activate unwanted modes.|$|R

A complete methodology for implementing the optimal filter using approximating recursive digital filtering is presented.
