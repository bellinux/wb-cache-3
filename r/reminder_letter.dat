40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of personalized mail and telephone interventions to improve follow-up to vision care in patients with diabetes. The project was divided in two parts. In the first study, 521 patients with diabetes who were due for a follow-up dilated fundus examination (DFE) were randomly assigned to receive 1) a single-mailed reminder form letter (usual care), or 2) a <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> plus an educational brochure, followed by a telephone call to schedule a DFE. In the second study, patients with diabetes were randomly assigned to receive 1) a single-mailed <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> (usual care), or 2) a personalized <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> plus an educational brochure or, 3) usual <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> plus a telephone call to schedule the DFE. Barriers to care utilization were also captured. The primary outcome was completion of a DFE within 3 months of suggested return date (timely appointment). Overall, all intervention groups were similar regarding demographic characteristics with a majority being female and African American. A combination of personalized mail and telephone communications and telephone communications alone were more effective in improving DFE adherence than a strategy based solely on standard mailed reminders. However, including an educational brochure did not enhance the effectiveness of the telephone-based intervention. Most commonly reported barriers to scheduling a DFE included busy schedule and issues with health insurance. In summary, a low cost telephone-based intervention significantly improves DFE adherence in an urban primary eye care setting. Presentation: 17 minute...|$|E

40|$|Background: Offering self-sampling to non-attendees of {{cervical}} screening increases screening attendance. Methods: We used {{observations from}} two Finnish {{studies on the}} use of self-sampling among the non-attendees to estimate in a hypothetical screening population of 100, 000 women the possible costs per extra screened woman and costs per extra detected and treated CIN 2 + with three intervention strategies; 1) a primary invitation and a <b>reminder</b> <b>letter,</b> 2) a primary invitation and a mailed self-sampling kit and 3) two invitation letters and a self-sampling kit. The program costs were derived from actual performance and costs in the original studies and a national estimate on management costs of HPV related diseases. Results: The price per extra participant and price per detected and treated CIN 2 + lesion was lower with a <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> than by self-sampling as a first reminder. When self-sampling was used as a second reminder with a low sampler price and a triage Pap-smear as a follow-up test for HPV-positive women instead of direct colposcopy referral, the eradication of a CIN 2 + lesion by self-sampling was not more expensive than in routine screening, and the addition of two reminders to the invitation protocol did not increase the price of an treated CIN 2 + lesion in the entire screened population. Conclusions: As a first reminder, a <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> is most likely a better choice. As second reminder, the higher costs of self-sampling might be compensated by the higher prevalence of CIN 2 + in the originally non-attending population...|$|E

40|$|Background: The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in England offers {{biennial}} guaiac faecal {{occult blood}} testing (gFOBt). There is a socioeconomic gradient in participation and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups have worse colorectal cancer survival than more advantaged groups. We compared the effectiveness {{and cost of}} an enhanced <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> with the usual <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> on overall uptake of gFOBt and the socioeconomic gradient in uptake. Methods: We enhanced the usual reminder by including a heading âA reminder to youâ and a short paragraph restating the offer of screening in simple language. We undertook a cluster-randomised trial of all 168 480 individuals who were due to receive a reminder over 20 days in 2013. Randomisation {{was based on the}} day of invitation. Blinding of individuals was not possible, but the possibility of bias was minimal owing to the lack of direct contact with participants. The enhanced reminder was sent to 78 067 individuals and 90 413 received the usual reminder. The primary outcome was the proportion of people adequately screened and its variation by quintile of Index of Multiple Deprivation. Data were analysed by logistic regression with conservative variance estimates to take account of cluster randomisation. Results: There was a small but statistically significant (P Â¼ 0. 001) increase in participation with the enhanced reminder (25. 8 % vs 25. 1 %). There was significant (P Â¼ 0. 005) heterogeneity of the effect by socioeconomic status with an 11 % increase in the odds of participation in the most deprived quintile (from 13. 3 to 14. 1 %) and no increase in the least deprived. We estimated that implementing the enhanced reminder nationally could result in up to 80 more people with high or intermediate risk colorectal adenomas and up to 30 more cancers detected each year if it were implemented nationally. The intervention incurred a small one- off cost of d 78 000 to modify the <b>reminder</b> <b>letter.</b> Conclusions: The enhanced reminder increases overall uptake and reduces the socioeconomic gradient in bowel cancer screening participation at little additional cost...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of faecal immunochemical test (FIT) -based screening programs is {{highly dependent on}} consistent participation over multiple rounds. We evaluated adherence to FIT screening over four rounds and aimed to identify determinants of participation behaviour.

All were invited for every consecutive round, except {{for those who had}} moved out of the area, passed the upper age limit, or had tested positive in a previous screening round. A <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> was sent to non-responders. We calculated participation rates per round, response rates to a <b>reminder</b> <b>letter,</b> and differences in participation between subgroups defined by age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES). Over the four rounds, participation rates increased significantly, from 60 % (95 % CI 60 - 61), 60 % (95 % CI 59 - 60), 62 % (95 % CI 61 - 63) to 63 % (95 % CI 62 - 64; P for trend < 0. 001) with significantly higher participation rates in women in all rounds (P < 0. 001). Of the 17 [*] 312 invitees eligible for at least two rounds of FIT screening, 12 [*] 455 (72 %) participated at least once, whereas 4857 (28 %) never participated; 8271 (48 %) attended all rounds when eligible. Consistent participation was associated with older age, female sex, and higher SES.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{demonstrated}} need {{to increase}} screening mammography utilization and strong evidence that mail and telephone outreach to women can increase screening, most managed care organizations have not adopted comprehensive outreach programs. The uncertainty about optimum strategies and cost effectiveness have retarded widespread acceptance. While 70 % of women report getting a mammogram within the prior 2 years, repeat mammography rates are less than 50 %. This 5 -year study is conducted though a Central Massachusetts healthcare plan and affiliated clinic. All womenhave adequate health insurance to cover the test. Methods/Design This randomized study compares 3 arms: <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> alone; <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> plus reminder call; <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> plus a second reminder and booklet plus a counselor call. All calls provide women {{with the opportunity to}} schedule a mammogram in a reasonable time. The invention period will span 4 years and include repeat attempts. The counselor arm is designed to educate, motivate and counsel women in an effort to alleviate PCP burden. All women {{who have been in the}} healthcare plan for 24 months and who have a current primary care provider (PCP) and who are aged 51 - 84 are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. Interventions are limited to women who become â¥ 18 months from a prior mammogram. Women and their physicians may opt out of the intervention study. Measurement of completed mammograms will use plan billing records and clinic electronic records. The primary outcome is the proportion of women continuously enrolled for â¥ 24 months who have had â¥ 1 mammogram in the last 24 months. Secondary outcomes include the number of women who need repeat interventions. The cost effectiveness analysis will measure all costs from the provider perspective. Discussion So far, 18, 509 women aged 51 - 84 have been enrolled into our tracking database and were randomized into one of three arms. At baseline, 5, 223 women were eligible for an intervention. We anticipate that the outcome will provide firm data about the maximal effectiveness as well as the cost effectiveness of the interventions both for increasing the mammography rate and the repeat mammography rate.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} a systematic effort to recruit women for breast screening. DESIGN AND SETTING: Individually addressed letters, {{signed by the}} woman's physician (followed by reminder letters and telephone calls as necessary) were sent to women in a rural family practice, prompting them {{to make an appointment}} for breast screening at the Ontario Breast Screening Program-the Kingston Centre. PARTICIPANTS: Women were eligible to receive a letter if they were aged 50 to 69, had not had a mammogram for at least 12 months, and did not have a previous diagnosis of breast cancer or current acute symptoms of breast disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response rates were measured to the initial letter, the <b>reminder</b> <b>letter,</b> and the telephone call. Women who came to the breast screening centre {{as a result of this}} recruitment effort were surveyed on their reaction to the letter. RESULTS: The response rate, as measured 9 months after the initial letters were sent, was 57. 5 %; 38 % of respondents to the initial letter and 49 % of respondents to the <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> said they would not have come to the centre without the letter.

This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of automated reminders by letter, email and short message service (SMS) on package request and sample return in an Internet-based Chlamydia screening among people aged 16 to 29 years in the Netherlands. Methods: Individuals not responding to the invitation letter received a <b>reminder</b> <b>letter</b> after 1 month. Email- and SMS-reminders were sent to persons who did not return their sample. It was examined to what extent reminders enhanced the response rate (% of package requests) and participation rate (% of sample return).

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The aim was {{to examine}} causes for {{non-response}} in a community survey, and how non-response influences prevalence estimates of some exposure and disease variables, and associations between the variables. DESIGN [...] This was a cross sectional questionnaire study with two <b>reminder</b> <b>letters.</b> The questionnaire asked for information on smoking habits, occupational airborne exposure and respiratory disorders. SETTING [...] A random sample of 4992 subjects {{from the general population}} aged 15 - 70 years of Hordaland County, Norway. MAIN RESULTS [...] The overall response rate was 90 %, with a 63 % response to the initial letter. The response rates to the first and second <b>reminder</b> <b>letters</b> were 56 % and 36 % respectively. In 20 % of the non-respondents an uncompleted questionnaire was returned with cause for non-response; in two thirds of these the cause for non-response was that the subject was not resident at the mailing address. A home visit to a random sample of 50 urban non-respondents provided further information on 29 subjects. A wrong address at the Central Population Registry and the subject's feeling of lack of personal benefit from a postal survey were the major reasons for non-response. Smokers were late respondents and subjects with respiratory disorders tended to be early respondents. CONCLUSION [...] The main reasons for non-response were a wrong mailing address and a feeling of lack of personal benefit from responding. Using only the initial letter would have changed the estimated prevalence of smokers from 39 % to 35 %. Otherwise, the estimated prevalence of the exposure and disease variables as well as the associations between them were only slightly changed after including the respondents to the first and second <b>reminder</b> <b>letters...</b>|$|R

Significant statistical difference was seen between usual care group and <b>letter</b> <b>reminders</b> (p< 0. 0005) and between usual care and email reminders (p< 0. 0005) but not between the <b>letter</b> <b>reminders</b> and the email reminders (p= 7. 11). Email reminders are as effective as <b>letter</b> <b>reminders</b> in increasing CRC screening rates...|$|R
40|$|Background: Realizing that {{influenza}} is {{an important}} health problem and that vaccination rates continue to be low, our primary survey goal was to find factors that affect patient compliance with the influenza immunization program at the Swedish Family Medicine Clinic in Seattle, Washington. Methods: Five hundred nineteen high-risk patients from a total clinic population of 4926 were mailed a questionnaire that asked about their influenza immunization history, their assessment of their influenza risk, and their reasons for obtaining or not obtaining the influenza vaccination. Results: The survey results revealed several important issues about this group: many patients {{were not aware of}} their increased risk for influenza; <b>reminder</b> <b>letters</b> were helpful, especially for older patients; younger high-risk patients were less likely to comply with immunization recommendations than older patients; and patients who were noncompliant with immunization recommendations in previous years would likely continue to be noncompliant. Conclusions: To improve influenza immunization rates, the following interventions are recommended: (1) <b>reminder</b> <b>letters</b> should be sent to patients at appropriate times to explain their risk factors, (2) younger high-risk patients should receive intensive education about the importance of influenza immunization and why they are considered to be at increased risk, and (3) high-risk patients who have failed to obtain the vaccinatio...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of us-ing personalized followup, as compared to re-minder letters, in increasing return rates at ur-ban eye disease screening clinics for African Americans with diabetes, and to identify fac-tors predictive of the patientâs likelihood of re-turning for annual follow-up exams. Research Design and Methods: All patients attending free community-based retinopathy screening clinics who were advised to return in one year for another diabetes eye evaluation (DEE) were randomized to standard or person-alized follow-up interventions. Patients in the standard follow-up group received <b>reminder</b> <b>letters</b> a month before it was time to return fo...|$|R
