40|$|Energy <b>recharging</b> has {{received}} much attention in recent years. Several <b>recharging</b> mechanisms were proposed for achieving perpetual lifetime {{of a given}} Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). However, most of them require a mobile <b>recharger</b> to visit each sensor and then perform the <b>recharging</b> task, which increases {{the length of the}} <b>recharging</b> path. Another common weakness of these works is the requirement for the mobile <b>recharger</b> to stop at the location of each sensor. As a result, it is impossible for <b>recharger</b> to move with a constant speed, leading to inefficient movement. To improve the <b>recharging</b> efficiency, this paper takes “recharging while moving” into consideration when constructing the <b>recharging</b> path. We propose a <b>Recharging</b> Path Construction (RPC) mechanism, which enables the mobile <b>recharger</b> to <b>recharge</b> all sensors using a constant speed, aiming to minimize the length of <b>recharging</b> path and improve the <b>recharging</b> efficiency while achieving the requirement of perpetual network lifetime of a given WSN.

40|$|<b>Recharge</b> {{can take}} two main forms, direct <b>recharge</b> from {{rainfall}} infiltrating {{the ground or}} indirect <b>recharge</b> from leakage from wadi beds. The <b>recharge</b> processes operating in the West Bank can be summarised as rainfall <b>recharge,</b> wadi <b>recharge,</b> urban <b>recharge</b> processes and irrigation losses. Rainfall <b>recharge</b> is the predominant form of <b>recharge,</b> whilst wadi <b>recharge,</b> urban and irrigation losses are only minor components. However, these minor components can be locally important. The <b>recharge</b> processes operating in the Wadi Natuf catchment are varied and complex. The four main geological strata through which <b>recharge</b> takes place are: • Jerusalam • Upper Lower Beit Kahil • Lower Beit Kahil • Hebron The main aquifer units are karstic which receive <b>recharge</b> once a wetting threshold is exceeded. This assumption is supported by field observations (Messerschmid, 2003) and a field experiment close to the study area (Lange et al., 2003). Other minor aquifers receive <b>recharge</b> and distribute water laterally to springs. Flow from springs, if not used for water supply or irrigation, can then be routed to other aquifer units or as loss from wadis. High intensity rainfall can produce overland runoff and wadi flow. Flowing wadis loose water to all but the Yatta formation. <b>Recharge</b> can, therefore, occur by two methods, direct infiltration from rainfall and from losses from wadi beds. There are four main <b>recharge</b> processes operating in the aquifers of the West Bank; 1. Direct <b>recharge</b> from rainfall 2. Indirect <b>recharge</b> from wadi losses 3. <b>Recharge</b> from urban water supply and waste water proceses 4. <b>Recharge</b> from irrigation losses The difference between rainfall and potential evaporation, known as effective rainfall, is the main control on direct <b>recharge</b> from rainfall. Rainfall is greatest {{in the north and}} west whereas potential evaporation is the highest in the south and east. The greatest potential for rainfall <b>recharge</b> is, therefore, in the north and west. Soil cover also controls the amount of rainfall <b>recharge</b> and is highly variable over the West Bank.

Point <b>recharge</b> is highly transient and may occur in relatively short-time periods, yet is capable of <b>recharging</b> a large volume of water, even from a single extreme rainfall event. Preferential groundwater flows are observed in karst aquifers with local fresher water pockets of low salinity that develop around point <b>recharge</b> sources. Measurable fresh water plumes develop only when a large quantity of surface water enters the aquifer as a point <b>recharge.</b> In fresh water plumes, the difference in chloride concentrations in diffuse and point <b>recharge</b> zones decreases as the plumes become enriched through mixing.

In karst aquifers, <b>recharge</b> estimation methods based on groundwater age distribution; average annual rainfall and basin average chloride in the conventional chloride mass balance (CMB) method are questionable due to theoretical limitations and key assumptions of these methods not being met.

In this study, simulations of three LSMs (Noah, Mosaic and VIC) obtained from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS- 2) are used to estimate potential <b>recharge</b> in the western US. Modeled <b>recharge</b> was compared with published <b>recharge</b> estimates for several aquifers in the region. Annual <b>recharge</b> to precipitation ratios across the study basins varied from 0. 01 % to 15 % for Mosaic, 3. 2 % to 42 % for Noah, and 6. 7 % to 31. 8 % for VIC simulations. Mosaic consistently underestimates <b>recharge</b> across all basins. Noah captures <b>recharge</b> reasonably well in wetter basins, but overestimates it in drier basins.

The global studies lack the specificity to inform decision making, while the local studies do little to clarify potential changes over large regions (major river basins, states, or groups of states), a scale often important {{in the development of}} water policy. An analysis of the potential impact of climate change on groundwater <b>recharge</b> across the western United States (west of 100 degrees longitude) is presented synthesizing existing studies and applying current knowledge of <b>recharge</b> processes and amounts. Eight representative aquifers located across the region were evaluated. For each aquifer published <b>recharge</b> budget components were converted into four standard <b>recharge</b> mechanisms: diffuse, focused, irrigation, and mountain-systems <b>recharge.</b> Future changes in individual <b>recharge</b> mechanisms and total <b>recharge</b> were then estimated for each aquifer. Model-based studies of projected climate-change effects on <b>recharge</b> were available and utilized for half of the aquifers. For the remainder, forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation were logically propagated through each <b>recharge</b> mechanism producing qualitative estimates of direction of changes in <b>recharge</b> only (not magnitude). Several key patterns emerge from the analysis. First, the available estimates indicate average declines of 10 - 20 % in total <b>recharge</b> across the southern aquifers, but {{with a wide range of}} uncertainty that includes no change.

In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation.

From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are <b>recharged</b> from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E

This compared well to noble gas derived <b>recharge</b> temperatures from the valley wells which ranged from 5 °C below to 7. 4 °C above the mean annual surface temperature of the valley. Cooler temperatures suggest an influence of <b>recharge</b> through the adjacent mountain block while warmer temperatures suggest an influence from summer irrigation...|$|R
