25|$|Coagulation begins almost {{instantly}} after {{an injury to}} the blood vessel has damaged the endothelium lining the vessel. Leaking of blood through the endothelium initiates two processes: changes in platelets, and the exposure of subendothelial tissue factor to plasma Factor VII, which ultimately leads to fibrin formation. Platelets immediately form a plug {{at the site of}} injury; this is called primary hemostasis. Secondary hemostasis occurs simultaneously: Additional coagulation factors or clotting factors beyond Factor VII (listed below) <b>respond</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> complex cascade to form fibrin strands, which strengthen the platelet plug.|$|E

25|$|Though neither {{program was}} {{developed}} as a narrative work, the software programs ELIZA (1964–1966) and SHRDLU (1968–1970) can formally be considered early examples of interactive fiction, as both programs used natural language processing to take input from their user and <b>respond</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> virtual and conversational manner.

25|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that {{nitrogen}} eutrophication decreases the amount of carbon allocation to soil biota over longer periods of time. This can pose problems to the mycobionts, whose production of sporocarps later in the growing season is totally dependent upon the allocation of photosynthates from host plants. Unlike the major community shifts that can occur in sporocarp responses to nitrogen addition, root tips and soil hyphae <b>respond</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> considerably subtler manner in the short term. However, over longer periods of time, eutrophication can cause major shifts in the dominant fungi and dramatically alter belowground diversity.|$|E

25|$|As Piaget {{believed}} {{development was}} a universal process, his initial sample sizes were inadequate, {{particularly in the}} formulation of his theory of infant development. Piaget’s theories of infant development were based on his observations of his own three children. While this clearly presents problems with the sample size, Piaget also probably introduced confounding variables and social desirability into his observations and his conclusions based on his observations. It is entirely possible Piaget conditioned his children to <b>respond</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> desirable manner, so, rather than having an understanding of object permanence, his children might have learned to behave in a manner that indicated they understood object permanence. The sample was also very homogenous, as all three children had a similar genetic heritage and environment. Piaget did, however, have larger sample sizes during his later years.|$|E
25|$|For V. maculifrons {{workers to}} {{communicate}} {{with others in the}} nest about a potential predator, they have an alarm pheromone that stimulates defense. This pheromone is linked to the sting apparatus and prompts attraction and attack. When the alarm pheromone is expressed, wasps around the nest entrance are typically seen circling, outlining a zigzagging flight, and going directly towards the target. However, foragers that were not at the nest when the pheromone was expressed do not <b>respond</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar manner. The facultative social parasite of V. maculifrons, Vespula squamosa, responds to the alarm response of V. maculifrons, suggesting common chemistry between pheromones. Since V. squamosa is known to take over nests of V. maculifrons, selection for V. squamosa favors the ability to recognize and respond to alarm calls within the nest.|$|E

500|$|In medicine, {{consciousness}} is examined using {{a set of}} procedures known as neuropsychological assessment. [...] There are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient: a simple procedure that requires minimal training, and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise. [...] The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli. [...] If so, the next {{question is whether the}} patient can <b>respond</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> meaningful way to questions and commands. [...] If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time.

500|$|In DSM-IV-TR the {{inhibited}} form {{is described}} as persistent failure to initiate or <b>respond</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> developmentally appropriate fashion to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited, hypervigilant, or highly ambivalent and contradictory responses (e.g., the child may respond to caregivers {{with a mixture of}} approach, avoidance, and resistance to comforting or may exhibit [...] "frozen watchfulness", hypervigilance while keeping an impassive and still demeanour). Such infants do not seek and accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain [...] "proximity", an essential element of attachment behavior. The disinhibited form shows diffuse attachments as manifest by indiscriminate sociability with marked inability to exhibit appropriate selective attachments (e.g., excessive familiarity with relative strangers or lack of selectivity in choice of attachment figures). There is therefore a lack of [...] "specificity" [...] of attachment figure, the second basic element of attachment behavior.|$|E

One Grant biographer described the comical nature of the events as an Edwardian farce.

500|$|Governor Dinwiddie had {{designated}} Fort Cumberland the regimental headquarters, {{even though}} it was located in Maryland. Washington learned that it was commanded by Captain John Dagworthy, who led a company of Maryland militia but also held a royal commission and would thus outrank him. [...] After a brief visit to Fort Cumberland in September 1755, Washington left, and chose to base himself at Winchester instead. He then embarked on recruiting expeditions to fill out the regiment, traveling often to Williamsburg. There, he complained bitterly to Dinwiddie about serving under Dagworthy. When Dagworthy refused to let the Virginians draw supplies from Fort Cumberland (which, despite its location, had been paid for and provisioned by Virginia), Dinwiddie came to agree with Washington. He wrote to Massachusetts Governor William Shirley, who was acting as commander in chief after Braddock's death, requesting royal commissions for Washington and other Virginia officers. When Shirley did not <b>respond</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> timely manner, Dinwiddie authorized Washington to travel to Boston to renew the request in person. Washington spent some time visiting in all of the major towns on the way, but his mission was ultimately only partially successful. [...] After receiving Washington, Shirley issued a decree that Virginia's officers outranked Dagworthy and other British officers of lower rank.|$|E
