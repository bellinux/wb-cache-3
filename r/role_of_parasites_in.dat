40|$|The {{potential}} role {{of animal}} behaviour, personality (inter-individual differences {{that are consistent}} over time or across contexts) and behavioural syndromes (suites of correlated behaviours) in various fields, such as ecology, evolution, genetics and associated fields, has gained great momentum {{over the past years}} and decades. However, the underlying factors influencing their maintenance and evolution has only recently attracted considerable amounts of attention. Especially the potential <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> <b>in</b> this context offers a range of interesting unanswered questions worth investigating. This thesis examined the potential impact of parasitic infections on host behaviour and personality from a mechanistic point of view. Thereby, the mechanisms underlying host behavioural change, a phenomenon regularly encountered among wild host species, in a well-established host-parasite model system (the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and the cestode Schistocephalus solidus) were investigated to draw conclusions about the potential <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> <b>in</b> the evolution and maintenance of host behaviour and personality.

40|$|The {{population}} trophic niche of free-living {{species can}} be subdivided into smaller niches comprising individuals specialising on specific food items.

Intrapopulation differences <b>in</b> <b>parasite</b> infections can develop from specialist individuals within populations. Their differences in morphology and habitat can increase {{their exposure to}} intermediate hosts via infected prey, altering their parasite fauna. However, we also suggest that parasite infections can drive this niche specialisation. Through mechanisms including parasite manipulation, altered host phenotypes, and/ or parasite-mediated competition, parasites can alter the resource availability of their hosts, altering their trophic niches. Thus, trophic niche specialisations could result from parasitism via varying influences on host traits, raising questions for future research...|$|R

40|$|While the {{free-living}} fauna of the Wadden Sea {{has received}} much interest, {{little is known}} on the distribution and effects of parasites in the Wadden Sea food web. However, recent studies on this special type of trophic interaction indicate a high diversity of parasites in the Wadden Sea and suggest a multitude of effects on the hosts. This also includes effects on specific predator-prey relationships and the general structure of the food web. Focussing on molluscs, a major group in the Wadden Sea in terms of biomass and abundance and an important link between primary producers and predators, we review existing studies and exemplify the ecological <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> <b>in</b> the Wadden Sea food web. First, we give a brief inventory of parasites occurring in the Wadden Sea, ranging from microparasites (e. g. protozoa, bacteria) to macroparasites (e. g. helminths, parasitic copepods) and discuss the effects of spatial scale on heterogeneities in infection levels. We then demonstrate how parasites can affect host population dynamics by acting as a strong mortality factor, causing mollusc mass mortalities. In addition, we will exemplify how parasites can mediate the interaction strength of predator-prey relationships and affect the topological structure of the Wadden Sea food web as a whole. Finally, we highlight some ongoing changes regarding parasitism in the Wadden Sea {{in the course of}} global change (e. g. species introduction, climate change) and identify important future research questions to entangle the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> <b>in</b> the Wadden Sea food we...|$|E

40|$|Food webs {{represent}} {{the set of}} consumer-resource interactions among a set of species that co-occur in a habitat, but most food web studies have omitted parasites and their interactions. Recent studies have provided conflicting evidence on whether including parasites changes food web structure, with some suggesting that parasitic interactions are structurally distinct from those among free-living species while others claim the opposite. Here, we describe a principled method for understanding food web structure that combines an efficient optimization algorithm from statistical physics called parallel tempering with a probabilistic generalization of the empirically well-supported food web niche model. This generative model approach allows us to rigorously estimate {{the degree to which}} interactions that involve parasites are statistically distinguishable from interactions among free-living species, whether parasite niches behave similarly to free-living niches, {{and the degree to which}} existing hypotheses about food web structure are naturally recovered. We apply this method to the well-studied Flensburg Fjord food web and show that while predation on <b>parasites,</b> concomitant predation <b>of</b> <b>parasites,</b> and parasitic intraguild trophic interactions are largely indistinguishable from free-living predation interactions, parasite-host interactions are different.

Reactivity of serum Abs from these patients has been extensively studied but little is known about the diversity of the in vivo IgG repertoire. We analyzed 125 variable H chain (VH) genes and compared it to repertoires from healthy individuals, and patients with autoimmune processes and other infections. VH were from plasma cells isolated from heart tissue of three cChHD patients and from a Fab combinatorial library derived from bone marrow of another cChHD patient. The <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> <b>in</b> shaping the Ab repertoire was assessed analyzing VH genes before and after panning against T. cruzi Ag. Among recovered VH genes, a significantly increased representation of VH 4 was observed. Plasma cells at the site of cardiac infiltration showed an increased VH 1 usage. CDR 3 lengths were similar to the ones found in the healthy repertoire and significantly shorter than in other infections. VH derived from anti-T. cruzi Fab and plasma cells showed a higher proportion of hypermutated genes, 46. 9 % and 43. 75 %, respectively, vs 30. 9 % of the cChHD patient repertoire, pointing to the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> Ags <b>in</b> the shaping of the humoral response in Chagas' disease.

40|$|The European eel, Anguilla anguilla, is an {{economically}} important species {{that contributes to}} biodiversity within UK and European inland and coastal waters. The numbers of A. anguilla have suffered serious decline {{in recent years and}} the species is now viewed as threatened. One contributory factor to this decline is believed to the pathological impact of infectious agents such as parasites and viruses. To assist understanding <b>of</b> the <b>role(s)</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> <b>in</b> the species decline, we have focused upon the swimbladder nematode Anguillicoloides crassus. This parasite is naturally present in the Pacific eel A. japonica, causing no deleterious health effects.

The primary aim {{of this study is to}} clarify the status of A. crassus within UK eel populations. To this end, we have examined > 500 eels from twenty-seven river systems across England and Wales. Our data confirm that A. crassus infection is widespread; for example, prevalence of infection is 79 %, 70 % and 36 % from specimens isolated from the river Piddle (Dorset), the river Cadoxton (South Wales) and the river Leven (Cumbria) respectively.

As parasitism can play keystone roles in interactions between competitors, and between predators and prey, here we examine the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> <b>in</b> maintaining IGP. We used numerical exploration of population dynamic equations to determine coexistence and exclusion zones for two species engaged in IGP with shared parasitism. We demonstrate that parasitism increases the range of conditions leading to coexistence when the parasite exerts a greater deleterious effect on the ‘stronger’ species {{in terms of the}} combined effects of competition and predation. Such a parasite can enable an inferior competitor that is also the less predatory to persist, and may actually lead to numerical dominance of this species...|$|E
40|$|We briefly {{present a}} {{synthesis}} of theoretical models in eco-epidemiology which merges the fields of ecology and epidemics.

Recent works have revealed that the complexity in parasite-mediated interactions can alter the dynamic behavior of eco-epidemiological systems, exhibiting oscillations, switching stability regimes. Both community structure and interaction strength also can affect the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> <b>in</b> the host-parasite dynamics. The emerging research area focuses on the spatial structure and distribution pattern in eco-epidemiology.

We tested whether parasites caused population cycles in red grouse by manipulating parasite intensities in four, paired 1 km 2 study areas during cyclic population declines over 4 years. Parasite reductions led to (1) larger grouse broods, (2) higher population densities in both autumn and spring, (3) reduced autumn population declines in one of two regions, and (4) reduced spring declines, but only in the first year. We infer that a single trophic interaction between a parasite and its host does not explain cyclic dynamics in spring breeding density in this species, although it contributed to the start of a cyclic decline. Another process was operating to drive the populations down. Together with our other results these findings emphasize that both trophic and intrinsic processes may act within populations to cause unstable dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{theory on}} the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> <b>in</b> the {{evolution}} of social behaviour has emphasized the costs of social behaviour to hosts. However, parasites whose primary effect on host fitness is to reduce fecundity can favour the evolutionary origin or maintenance of social behaviour, including eusociality, under certain conditions. If the parasites are not readily transmitted among members of social groups, then other group members will not be selected to reject infected individuals as social partners, nor will adaptive suicide or avoidance of grouping be selectively favoured for infected individuals. Rather, total or partial parasitic castration may promote the expression of helping behaviour by infected individuals. Some parasites may therefore act to increase variance in direct reproductive value within populations or societies, and to promote reproductive division of labour. The necessary conditions of reduced host fecundity and low within-group transmission are met in some insect-parasite systems, and could occur in other host-parasite systems as well...|$|E
40|$|The study <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> <b>in</b> {{the context}} <b>of</b> {{community}} level organization, either as parasites embedded within host communities, or as parasite communities themselves, is now quite prevalent in parasitology and ecology today.

Papers in The Journal of Parasitology by Clark Read (1951) and John Holmes (1961) were the defining contributions to the beginning of the field, and the ideas elaborated by these two parasitologists still inspire current debates on parasite community structure today. There are several probable explanations for why investigation <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> communities was not popular during the early part of the century.
