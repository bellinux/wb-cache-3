Some closures need to be tamper resistant and have child-resistant packaging features. A tamper-evident band is a common tamper warning for screw caps of bottles, for example.|$|E

Originally packaged in a tin can with a turn key and <b>reclosable</b> lid, the product's packaging was changed to glass jars because of metal shortages during World War II.

40|$|The {{ability of}} 50 {{rheumatoid}} arthritis patients with hand involvement and 50 normal control subjects {{to open a}} range of <b>reclosable</b> tablet containers and unit dose packs was tested. Child-resistant containers, particularly the clic-loc type, proved the most difficult for patients and control subjects to open. Smaller containers were less easy to open than comparable ones of a larger size. Only 54 % patients were able to remove a suppository from its wrapping. Blister packs and conven-tional screw-capped tablet bottles were easiest to open. Dispensing of drugs for rheumatic patients in child-resistant containers {{should be limited to}} those without hand involvement. BY agreement between the medical and pharmaceutical professions it was recommended that from 2 March 1981 all solid-dose oral medicines should be dispensed in <b>reclosable</b> child-resistant containers (CRCs) or in unit-dose packaging. Exceptions include the elderly or handicapped patient. However, we are aware that many rheumatic patients still receive dispensed drugs in containers which {{they may not be able}} to open, often because it is a relative or friend who collects the prescription from the pharmacy. Although both the elderly (1) and the arthritic (2) patient have difficulty in opening CRCs, only a limited range of containers has been tested amongst these patients...|$|E

40|$|A novel safehold {{control law}} was {{developed}} for the nadir-pointing Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) spacecraft, necessitated by a challenging combination of constraints. The instrument optics {{did not have a}} <b>reclosable</b> cover to protect them from potentially catastrophic damage if they were exposed to direct sunlight. The baseline safehold control law relied on a single-string inertial reference unit. A gyroless safehold law was developed to give a degree of rebustness to gyro failures. Typical safehold solutions were not viable; thermal constraints made spin stabilization unsuitable, and an inertial hold based solely on magnetometer measurements wandered unacceptably during eclipse. The novel approach presented here maintains a momentum bias vector not for gyroscopic stiffness, but to use as an inertial reference direction during eclipse. The control law design is presented. The effect on stability of the rate-deficiency of magnetometer-based rate derivation is assessed. The control law's performance is evaluated by simulation...|$|E
40|$|The Framing Camera (FC) is the German {{contribution}} to the Dawn mission. The camera will map 4 Vesta and 1 Ceres through a clear filter and 7 band-pass filters covering the wavelengths from the visible to the near-IR. The camera will allow {{the determination of the}} physical parameters of the asteroids, the reconstruction of their global shape as well as local topography and surface geomorphology, and provide information on composition via surface reflectance characteristics. The camera will also serve for orbit navigation. The resolution of the Framing Camera will be up to 12 m per pixel in low altitude mapping orbit at Vesta (62 m per pixel at Ceres), at an angular resolution of 93. 7 Ã�Â¼radÃ¢Â�Â�pxÃ¢Â�Â� 1. The instrument uses a <b>reclosable</b> front door to protect the optical system and a filter-wheel mechanism to select the band-pass for observation. The detector data is read out and processed by a data processing unit. A power converter unit supplies all required power rails for operation and thermal maintenance. For redundancy reasons, two identical cameras were provided, both located {{side by side on the}} +Z-deck of the spacecraft. Each camera has a mass of 5. 5 kg...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - Packaging {{features}} {{have been}} shown to be of great importance for the consumer final choice of fresh products (Silayoi and Speece, 2007). Packaging is an extrinsic attribute, which consumers tend to rely on, when relevant intrinsic attributes of the product are not available. In the current literature, studies on the influences of packaging features on consumer preferences are mainly related to classical preference evaluation methods like conjoint analysis (CA). The purpose of this paper is to apply both CA and the less known combination of uniform discrete and shifted binomial distributions (CUB) models to food packaging evaluations. Design/methodology/approach - Starting from a real case study in this field, along with CA, the author apply CUB models (Iannario and Piccolo, 2010) as a useful tool to evaluate preferences. CUB models can grasp some psychological characteristics of consumers related to the "feeling" toward packaging attributes and related to an inherently "uncertainty" that affects the consumers' choices. Both psychological characteristics "feeling" and "uncertainty" can be linked to relevant subject's information. At first we detect preferred packaging attributes of fresh food by means of CA, then we apply CUB models to some relevant attributes from the CA study. Findings - Results show that attributes like packaging material and size/shape of packaging are the most important attributes and that biodegradable packaging, <b>reclosable</b> trays/bags and long "best by" date are also valuable features for consumers. The introduction of covariates showed that specific demographic characteristics are linked to both feeling and uncertainty. Originality/value - The "data driven" segmentation results give to the integrated approach "CUB models and Conjoint Analysis" the most important added value...|$|E
