5|$|However, {{the upper}} bound {{established}} by Zarankiewicz for the crossing numbers of complete bipartite graphs {{can be achieved}} using only straight edges. Therefore, if the Zarankiewicz conjecture is correct, then the complete bipartite graphs have <b>rectilinear</b> crossing numbers equal to their crossing numbers.|$|E
5|$|Linear motions (or {{translatory}} motions), which {{move in a}} {{line between}} two points. <b>Rectilinear</b> motion is motion {{in a straight line}} between two points, whereas curvilinear motion is motion following a curved path.|$|E
5|$|Normally a {{sluggish}} species, {{it relies on}} camouflage for protection. Locomotion is primarily <b>rectilinear,</b> using the broad ventral scales in a caterpillar fashion and aided by its own weight for traction. When agitated, it can resort to a typical serpentine movement and move with surprising speed.|$|E
5|$|The kerb-stones {{around the}} tomb display some patterning; {{those on the}} {{northern}} side are mostly <b>rectilinear,</b> while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape. It is probable {{that there was an}} ancillary dry-stone wall constructed using blocks of ironstone from the geological Folkestone beds, as is evident at Chestnuts Long Barrow. Given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally, it may have been quarried.|$|E
5|$|The long, <b>rectilinear,</b> two-storey building, had {{a double}} {{cantilevered}} frame supported {{on a single}} row of concrete columns. These columns tilted outwards from a vertical position. Floor to ceiling glazing on the second storey opened out onto a balcony running {{the length of the}} building. It included technical innovations from America including acoustic ceiling tiles, underfloor electricity ducts and fluorescent lighting.|$|E
5|$|These common {{architectural}} features {{among the}} Medway Megaliths indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels {{elsewhere in the}} British Isles. For instance, {{they would have been}} taller than most other chambered long barrows in Britain, with internal heights of up to 3.8 metres (10 feet). Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows—like the Cotswold-Severn group in south-western Britain—there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum's <b>rectilinear</b> shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow's facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit's Coty. These variations might have been caused by the tombs being altered and adapted over the course of their use; in this scenario, the monuments would be composite structures.|$|E
25|$|Tabriz is {{the market}} {{center for the}} Iranian Northwest. Carpets woven in this region mainly use the {{symmetric}} knot. Heriz is a local center of production for mainly room-size carpets. Warps and weft are of cotton, the weaving is rather coarse, with high-quality wool. Prominent central medaillons are frequently seen with <b>rectilinear</b> outlines highlighted in white. The ornaments of the field are in bold, <b>rectilinear</b> style, sometimes in an allover design. Higher quality Heriz carpets are known as Serapi. The village of Sarab produces runners and galleries with broad main borders either of camel hair or wool dyed in the colour of camel hair. Large, interconnected medaillons fill the field. Mostly <b>rectilinear,</b> geometric and floral patterns are dyed in pink red and blue. Bakshaish carpets with a shield-shaped large medaillon, less elaborate <b>rectilinear</b> patterns in salmon red and blue are labeled after the village of Bakhshayesh. Karadja produces runners with specific square and octagonal medaillons in succession.|$|E
25|$|According to quantum {{mechanics}} (particularly quantum indeterminacy), no possible measurement distinguishes between the 4 different polarization states, {{as they are}} not all orthogonal. The only possible measurement is between any two orthogonal states (an orthonormal basis). So, for example, measuring in the <b>rectilinear</b> basis gives a result of horizontal or vertical. If the photon was created as horizontal or vertical (as a <b>rectilinear</b> eigenstate) then this measures the correct state, {{but if it was}} created as 45° or 135° (diagonal eigenstates) then the <b>rectilinear</b> measurement instead returns either horizontal or vertical at random. Furthermore, after this measurement the photon is polarized in the state it was measured in (horizontal or vertical), with all information about its initial polarization lost.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} part of {{the above}} derivation is just simple calculus, same as in the preceding <b>rectilinear</b> case.|$|E
25|$|The two {{patterns}} are unified by {{the framework of}} <b>rectilinear</b> wall sections and the grid of vertical and horizontal elements.|$|E
25|$|Edges—convex, <b>rectilinear</b> or concave, {{and more}} or less even. Edges on some {{specimens}} are denticulate – scalloped – or notched. Some specimens have unsharpened edges. The profile of a hand axe's worked edges can be regular without pronounced <b>rectilinear</b> deviations (the edge is gently curved {{in the form of}} an S) or an edge may be more sinuous and wave-formed with pronounced curves or deviations in the edge's profile. On some specimens only selected areas have been formed into a working edge.|$|E
25|$|This planar {{geometry}} and <b>rectilinear</b> nature are also echoed and scaled down {{in nearly every}} individual member of the structure’s interior and exterior façade. Metal paneling, glazing, exterior ornamentation are all representative of the buildings overall dimension. Furthermore, it is evident from any elevation, that <b>rectilinear</b> overlap has been transferred from plan to section. This relentless linearity is {{broken only by the}} two abstract pod shapes and the cylindrical columns, in what appears to be an intentional play by the architect to create interest and tension.|$|E
25|$|The Euclidean norm {{from above}} falls into this class {{and is the}} 2-norm, and the 1-norm is the norm that {{corresponds}} to the <b>rectilinear</b> distance.|$|E
25|$|The University of Memphis {{campus is}} {{set out in}} a <b>rectilinear</b> format, planned as a {{geometric}} design similar to the Jeffersonian style of the University of Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Similar invariants {{can also}} be defined for some other {{dissection}} puzzles, including as the problem of dissecting <b>rectilinear</b> polygons into each other by axis-parallel cuts and translations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rectilinear,</b> modular {{structure}} {{of the building and}} its integrated courtyards, as well as the connecting corridors, are said to be inspired by the design of Buddhist temples in China.|$|E
25|$|City rendering: An ESRI shapefile {{containing}} a polygonal {{description of the}} building footprints was read in and then the polygons were resampled onto a <b>rectilinear</b> grid, which was extruded into the featured cityscape.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{a similar}} {{mechanism}} converted <b>rectilinear</b> to polar coordinates, {{but it was}} not particularly successful and was eliminated in a significant redesign (USN, Mk. 1 to Mk. 1A).|$|E
25|$|The {{facility}} is a <b>rectilinear</b> 5-level stadium which can seat up to 64,000 spectators {{for a typical}} football game and is expandable to hold 72,000 spectators, allowing the possibility of hosting a Super Bowl.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>rectilinear</b> TSP the {{distance}} between two cities {{is the sum of}} the absolute values of the differences of their x- and y-coordinates. This metric is often called the Manhattan distance or city-block metric.|$|E
25|$|The Bid Majnūn, or Weeping Willow {{design is}} in fact a {{combination}} of weeping willow, cypress, poplar and fruit trees in <b>rectilinear</b> form. Its origin was attributed to Kurdish tribes, as the earliest known examples are from the Bidjar area.|$|E
25|$|Metzinger's {{works from}} 1915 and 1916 show a more {{restrained}} use of <b>rectilinear</b> grids, heavy surface texture and bold decorative patterning. The manifest {{primacy of the}} geometric armature strikingly controls nearly every element of the composition, ensuring the synthetic unity of the whole.|$|E
25|$|Eureka, Eureka. Never have I {{had so much}} {{satisfaction}} as at this moment, when I {{have just}} explained rigorously, by the simple law of <b>rectilinear</b> motion, those of universal gravitation, which decreases in the same proportion as the squares of the distance increase.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in BB84 is quantum transmission. Alice creates a random bit (0 or 1) and then {{randomly}} selects one of her two bases (<b>rectilinear</b> or diagonal in this case) to transmit it in. She then prepares a photon polarization state depending both on the bit value and basis, {{as shown in the}} adjacent table. So for example a 0 is encoded in the <b>rectilinear</b> basis (+) as a vertical polarization state, and a 1 is encoded in the diagonal basis (x) as a 135° state. Alice then transmits a single photon in the state specified to Bob, using the quantum channel. This process is then repeated from the random bit stage, with Alice recording the state, basis and time of each photon sent.|$|E
25|$|The Romans used a {{consolidated}} {{scheme for}} city planning, developed for civil convenience. The basic plan {{consisted of a}} central forum with city services, surrounded by a compact, <b>rectilinear</b> grid of streets. A river sometimes flowed near or through the city, providing water, transport, and sewage disposal.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} recent {{addition to the}} Red Room is a tall <b>rectilinear</b> secretary desk attributed to Charles-Honoré Lannuier. It was a gift of the White House Historical Association during the Clinton administration, {{on the occasion of}} the 200th anniversary of the completion of the house.|$|E
25|$|The {{security}} of the protocol comes from encoding the information in non-orthogonal states. Quantum indeterminacy means that these states cannot in general be measured without disturbing the original state (see No cloning theorem). BB84 uses two pairs of states, with each pair conjugate to the other pair, and the two states within a pair orthogonal to each other. Pairs of orthogonal states {{are referred to as}} a basis. The usual polarization state pairs used are either the <b>rectilinear</b> basis of vertical (0°) and horizontal (90°), the diagonal basis of 45° and 135° or the circular basis of left- and right-handedness. Any two of these bases are conjugate to each other, and so any two can be used in the protocol. Below the <b>rectilinear</b> and diagonal bases are used.|$|E
25|$|They have a <b>rectilinear</b> {{form with}} the side walls that extend outwardly. Some, like that of Malchittu at Arzachena, are apsidal while others such as the temple of Sa Carcaredda at Villagrande Strisaili culminate with a {{circular}} room. They are surrounded by sacred precincts called temenos.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} {{towards a}} more <b>rectilinear</b> style with simplified forms continues with {{greater emphasis on}} clear geometric principles (derived from the works of Cézanne) not solely visible {{in the works of}} Braque, but too in the works of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay (Picasso being absent from the salons).|$|E
25|$|Widespread {{clinical}} {{use of nuclear}} medicine {{began in the early}} 1950s, as knowledge expanded about radionuclides, detection of radioactivity, and using certain radionuclides to trace biochemical processes. Pioneering works by Benedict Cassen in developing the first <b>rectilinear</b> scanner and Hal O. Anger's scintillation camera (Anger camera) broadened the young discipline of nuclear medicine into a full-fledged medical imaging specialty.|$|E
25|$|The Tiwanaku {{created a}} {{powerful}} ideology, using previous Andean icons that were widespread throughout their sphere of influence. They used extensive trade routes and shamanistic art. Tiwanaku art consisted of legible, outlined figures depicted in curvilinear style with a naturalistic manner, while Wari art {{used the same}} symbols in a more abstract, <b>rectilinear</b> style with a militaristic style.|$|E
25|$|The {{asymmetric}} knot allows {{to produce}} more fluent, often curvilinear designs, while more bold, <b>rectilinear</b> designs may use the symmetric knot. As exemplified by Senneh rugs with their elaborate designs woven with symmetric knots, {{the quality of the}} design depends more on the weaver's skills, than on the type of knot which is used.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 4th {{millennium}} BC, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2 {{and the general}} character of the remains on the site link it culturally with Neolithic 2 (or PPNB) sites in the West Syrian and Middle Euphrates groups. This link is established {{by the presence of}} <b>rectilinear</b> mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.|$|E
25|$|A top, whose parts {{by their}} {{cohesion}} are perpetually drawn aside from <b>rectilinear</b> motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than {{as it is}} retarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve their motions both progressive and circular for a much longer time.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 {{model was}} {{completely}} restyled—It replaced the 1977-based <b>rectilinear</b> design with rounded, more aerodynamic sheetmetal. While {{the body and}} interior were all new, excluding the Anti-Lock Braking System, the chassis and powertrain were carried over from the 1990 model. Several major components (including the floor pan) are entirely interchangeable between 1977 and 1996.|$|E
