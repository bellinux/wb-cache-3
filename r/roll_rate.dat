5|$|Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) was an American {{electronics}} company {{founded in}} Albuquerque, New Mexico that began manufacturing electronic calculators in 1971 and personal computers in 1975. Ed Roberts and Forrest Mims founded MITS in December 1969 to produce miniaturized telemetry modules for model rockets {{such as a}} <b>roll</b> <b>rate</b> sensor. In 1971, Roberts redirected the company into the electronic calculator market and the MITS 816 desktop calculator kit was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics. The calculators were very successful and sales topped one million dollars in 1973. A brutal calculator price war left the company deeply in debt by 1974.|$|E

The large control surfaces made the FD 1 difficult to control or even fly with precision although a rapid <b>roll</b> <b>rate</b> was achieved. Only one FD1 was built, with the second (VX357) and third (VX364) airframes being cancelled before they entered production.|$|E

This paper develops and employs a baseline model to assess <b>roll</b> <b>rates.</b> While on the sur-face <b>roll</b> <b>rates</b> have some intuitively satisfying properties, beneath the surface they have several previously unrecognized shortcomings. Analysis based on stochastic, strictly preference-based voting within parties suggests that inferences based on <b>roll</b> <b>rates</b> overstate party influence generally, and they exaggerate the influence of the majority party relative to the minority.

25|$|The aircraft's {{extremely}} low wing loading of just 23.9lb/ft² gave it outstanding turning performance, and its high power-to-weight ratio of 0.186hp/lb gave superb climbing {{performance for the}} time. The lack of an engine supercharger was a serious handicap at high altitudes. Compared to the later Allison-engined P-40, the P-36 shared the P-40's traits of excellent high-speed handling, <b>roll</b> <b>rate</b> that improved at high speed, and relatively light controls at high speed. However, it was underpowered, affecting its acceleration and top speed, {{and it did not}} accelerate in a dive as well as the P-40.|$|E
25|$|The fuel prevalves were deleted {{from the}} Mercury-Redstone in the {{interest}} of improved reliability, since if they closed during a launch, an abort condition could be triggered. On the three unmanned flights, it was discovered that the Mercury-Redstone exhibited a roll transient of 8° per second versus 4° for the Redstone missile. Although this was below the 12° per second roll transient required to trigger an abort, the <b>roll</b> <b>rate</b> sensor was removed from the two manned flights to reduce the chances of an accidental abort (the booster still retained the roll attitude angle sensor which would be triggered at 10°).|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} make the {{aircraft}} more manoeuvrable and in particular to increase its <b>roll</b> <b>rate,</b> a triplane configuration was chosen. This provided about the same total wing area as that of the biplane Scout with a lower moment of inertia about the roll axis. The Triplane had single-bay wings with heavy stagger, carrying six ailerons. The lower wing was close to the ground so two underwing skids were added below the interplane struts. The mid-line of the nacelle, with the engine at its rear, was on the centre plane, giving the pilot a slightly inferior view than from the Scout.|$|E
40|$|Cartel Theory {{research}} exclusively {{focuses on}} national legislatures, {{which has led}} to empirical uniformity among the studies. By only examining national legislatures, researchers have only observed chambers where there is a strong connection between party reputation and legislator reelection. This project examines legislatures where the connections between party reputation and legislator reelection vary widely. 	National legislatures generally have legislative rules enabling agenda control and therefore tend to have low majority <b>roll</b> <b>rates.</b> The variation in majority <b>roll</b> <b>rates</b> this project finds among U. S. state legislatures is due to the variance in legislative rules among these chambers. While most other Cartel Theory research implicitly assumes a connection between legislative rules and majority <b>roll</b> <b>rates,</b> this project verifies it empirically. 	This project further seeks to determine what causes legislative cartelization. In order to determine causal factors, the project examines cases where there is variation in legislative cartelization and the connection between party reputation and legislator reelection. U. S. state legislatures display substantial variation in both of these variables and are, therefore, ideal candidates for observation. 	With these motivations in mind, this project’s primary two research questions test unverified assumptions made in the Cartel Theory literature: 1. 	How strong is the relationship between legislative cartelization and the connection between party reputation and legislator reelection probability? 2. 	Are low majority <b>roll</b> <b>rates</b> indicative of chambers having institutionalized rules enabling agenda control? The answer to the first is that, among U. S. state legislatures, there is not a consistently strong relationship between majority <b>roll</b> <b>rates</b> and the connection between party reputation and legislator reelection, though there is a strong relationship between agenda control-enabling legislative rules and this connection. These two findings suggest that we need alternative measures of cartelization. More broadly, the findings suggest that Cartel Theory may not be as universally applicable as it once seemed. The answer to the second question {{is that there is a}} strong connection between low majority <b>roll</b> <b>rates</b> and legislative rules enabling agenda control but that this relationship is variable and alternative measures of cartelization are necessary for future Cartel Theory research...|$|R

40|$|We present {{evidence}} suggesting that the majority party in the U. S. Senate exercises significant negative agenda control. Furthermore, this majority party negative agenda control in the Senate is very similar, in empirical terms, to negative agenda control exercised by the majority party in the U. S. House of Representatives. This evidence comes from comparisons of majority party <b>roll</b> <b>rates</b> across legislative vehicles (S bills, confirmation votes, and conference reports) and across chambers of Congress. Majority party <b>roll</b> <b>rates</b> respond to disagreement with other political actors as if the Senate majority party does restrict agenda access. Moreover, the response of majority party <b>roll</b> <b>rates</b> to disagreement with other political actors is very similar across the two chambers. Given that explanations of majority party negative agenda control in the House are often predicated on chamber-specific factors with no clear analogues in the Senate, the results reveal a striking cross-chamber similarity. The stakes of the role and power of politicalparties in the U. S. Congress are vast.

25|$|A notable {{advantage}} of the FRP transverse leaf springs—when supported with widely spaced, pivotable mounts—is the ability to supplement or replace the anti-roll bar. Typically springs that provide a sufficient ride rate need a supplemental spring (the anti-roll bar) to increase the suspension <b>roll</b> <b>rate.</b> The coupling of {{the two sides of}} the transverse leaf spring across the vehicle results in an anti-roll bar like behavior. Corvette engineers have cited this property as enabling the use of a lighter anti-roll bar, and even eliminating the rear anti-roll bar on some versions of the seventh generation Corvette.|$|E
25|$|The P-47N was {{the last}} Thunderbolt variant to be produced. It was {{designed}} as an escort fighter for the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers flying raids on the Japanese home islands. Increased internal fuel capacity and drop tanks had done much to extend the Thunderbolt's range during its evolution, and the only other way to expand the fuel capacity was to put fuel tanks into the wings. Thus, a new wing was designed with two 50U.S. gallon (190l) fuel tanks. The third YP-47M prototype (42-27387) was fitted with this wing and became the YP-47N; its designation was later changed to XP-47N. This redesigned aircraft first flew in July 1944. The redesign proved successful in extending range to about 2,000mi (3,200km), and the squared-off wingtips improved the <b>roll</b> <b>rate.</b> The P-47N entered mass production with the R-2800-57 engine, and later used the upgraded R-2800-73 or -77. A total of 1,816 were built. The very last Thunderbolt to be built, a P-47N-25, rolled off the production line in October 1945.|$|E
25|$|Against the Spitfire V, the Fw 190 {{was found}} to be better in all respects with the {{exception}} of turning radius. At 2,000ft, the Fw 190 was 25 to 30mph faster; at 3,000ft it was 30 to 35mph faster. Its lowest speed advantage was 20mph faster at 15,000ft. At all altitudes it remained the faster fighter. The Fw 190 was also faster in the climb. If a Fw 190 was engaged by a Spitfire V, it could use its superior <b>roll</b> <b>rate</b> to enter a dive in the opposite direction. Its dive speed would enable it to clear the Spitfire. In defensive mode, the Spitfire could evade an attack if caught at low speed only by using its advantage in turning circles. If travelling at maximum speed when engaged, the Spitfire could gain speed in the dive, forcing a longer chase, and drawing the Fw 190 further away from its landing ground.|$|E

25|$|P-63A-8, SN 269261, was {{extensively}} {{tested at}} TsAGI {{in what was}} then the world's largest wind tunnel. Soviet input was significant. With the Soviet Union being the largest buyer of the aircraft, Bell was quick to implement their suggestions. The vast majority of the changes in the A sub-variants were a direct result of Soviet input, e.g. increased pilot armor and fuselage hardpoint on the A-5, underwing hardpoints and extra fuel tanks on the A-6, etc. The Soviet Union even experimented with ski landing gear for the P-63A-6, but this never reached production. Most significantly, Soviet input resulted in moving the main cannon forward, favorably changing the center of gravity, and increasing its ammo load from 30 to 58 rounds for the A-9 variant. The P-63 had an impressive <b>roll</b> <b>rate,</b> besting the Americans' P-47, P-40, and P-51—and the Japanese Navy's Kawanishi N1K2 Shiden-Kai fighter—with a rate of 110° per second at 275mph (443km/h).|$|E
25|$|Normally, a wing {{with such}} a low aspect ratio will suffer from very poor {{performance}} due {{to the degree of}} induced drag created at the wingtips, as the higher pressure air below spills around the wingtip to the lower-pressure region above. In a conventional aircraft, these wingtip vortices carry a lot of energy with them and hence create drag. The usual approach to reducing these vortices is to build a wing with a high aspect ratio, i.e. one that is long and narrow. However, such wings compromise the maneuverability and <b>roll</b> <b>rate</b> of the aircraft, or present a structural challenge in building them stiff enough. The XF5U attempted to overcome the tip vortex problem using the propellers to actively cancel the drag-causing tip vortices. The propellers are arranged to rotate in the opposite direction to the tip vortices, with the aim of retaining the higher-pressure air below the wing. With this source of drag eliminated, the aircraft would fly with a much smaller wing area, and the small wing would yield high maneuverability with greater structural strength.|$|E
25|$|The EL {{brought with}} it {{improvements}} to braking and handling. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high-speed steering. With {{the introduction of the}} new model, buyers could now purchase a Falcon with standard (optional on GLi) anti-lock brakes featuring the latest Bosch 5.3 module. Perhaps the biggest advancement with the EL was the improvements to the handling woes of the EF, with improvements established to the suspension and steering. Engineers at Tickford had discovered that by lowering the pivot point of the Watt's linkages in the rear suspension by 20millimetres (0.8in), that the roll oversteer effect which plagued the EF could finally be eliminated. Previously on EF models, during hard cornering the rear end of the car often felt as if it could not keep up with the front, due to the difference in <b>roll</b> <b>rate</b> between the front and rear suspension. The result of this produced unpredictable car handling at times, where the delayed weight transfer at the rear would seek to damage the integrity of the outside rear tyre grip. This was exaggerated even further in wet weather or on vehicles fitted with poor tyres. Although this problem was addressed to a degree in the EFII update, it was the EL that became the first base level Falcon to feature a rear suspension setup that would complement the precision of rack and pinion steering introduced in the EA Falcon eight years earlier. The improved suspension geometry allowed Ford to soften the spring rates on both front and rear on the EL for a more compliant ride, as the driver no longer had roll oversteer to contain.|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} lateral-directional control system for a fighter airplane capable of controlled operation at extreme angles of attack is developed. The subject airplane is representative of a modern twin-engine high-performance jet fighter, is equipped with ailerons, rudder, and independent horizontal-tail surfaces. Idealized bidirectional thrust-vectoring engine nozzles are appended to the mathematic model of the airplane to provide additional control moments. Optimal schedules for lateral and directional pseudo control variables are calculated. Use of pseudo controls results in coordinated operation of the aerodynamic and thrust-vectoring controls with minimum coupling between the lateral and directional airplane dynamics. Linear quadratic regulator designs are used to specify a preliminary flight control system to improve the stability and response characteristics of the airplane. Simulated responses to step pilot control inputs are stable and well behaved. For lateral stick deflections, peak stability axis <b>roll</b> <b>rates</b> are between 1. 25 and 1. 60 rad/sec over an angle-of-attack range of 10 deg to 70 deg.
