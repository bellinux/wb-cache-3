50|$|A {{power cord}} or {{appliance}} coupler {{may have a}} <b>retaining</b> <b>clamp,</b> a mechanical device that prevents it from inadvertently being pulled or shaken loose. Typical application areas with stricter safety requirements include medical technology, stage and lighting technology, and computing equipment. For specialty equipment such as construction machinery, sound and lighting equipment, emergency medical defibrillators and electrical power tools, used in locations without a convenient power source, extension cords are used to carry the electric current up to hundreds of feet away from an outlet.|$|E

50|$|The {{collapse}} {{was caused}} by the failure of two pin and hanger assemblies that held the deck in place on the outer side of the bridge, according to an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. Rust formed within the bearing of the pin, exerting a force on the hanger which was beyond design limits for the <b>retaining</b> <b>clamps.</b> It forced the hanger on the inside part of the expansion joint at the southeast corner off the end of the pin that was holding it, and the load was shifted to outside hanger. The extra load on the remaining hanger started a fatigue crack at a sharp corner on the pin. When it failed catastrophically, the deck was supported at just three corners. When two heavy trucks and a car entered the section, the remaining expansion joint failed, and the deck crashed into the river below.|$|R
5000|$|An [...] "overvoltage clamping" [...] bulk {{semiconductor}} {{similar to}} an MOV, {{though it does}} not clamp as well. However, it usually has a longer life than an MOV. It is used mostly in high-energy DC circuits, like the exciter field of an alternator. It can dissipate power continuously, and it <b>retains</b> its <b>clamping</b> characteristics throughout the surge event, if properly sized.|$|R
40|$|Turgor {{pressure}} {{provides a}} sensitive indicator for irrigation scheduling. Leaf turgor pressure of Musa acuminate {{was measured by}} using the so-called leaf patch clamp pressure probe, i. e. by application of an external, magnetically generated and constantly <b>retained</b> <b>clamp</b> pressure to a leaf patch and determination of the attenuated output pressure P p that is highly correlated with the turgor pressure. Real-time recording of P p values was made using wireless telemetric transmitters, which send the data to a receiver base station where data are logged and transferred to a GPRS modem linked to an Internet server. Probes functioned over several months under field and laboratory conditions without damage to the leaf patch. Measurements showed that the magnetic-based probe could monitor very sensitively changes in turgor pressure induced by changes in microclimate (temperature, relative humidity, irradiation and wind) and irrigation. Irrigation effects could clearly be distinguished from environmental effects. Interestingly, oscillations in stomatal aperture, which occurred frequently below turgor pressures of 100 kPa towards noon at high transpiration or at high wind speed, were reflected in the P p values. The period of pressure oscillations was comparable with the period of oscillations in transpiration and photosynthesis. Multiple probe readings on individual leaves and/or on several leaves over the entire height of the plants further emphasised the great impact of this non-invasive turgor pressure sensor system for elucidating the dynamics of short- and long-distance water transport in higher plants...|$|R
40|$|US 20070165297 A 1 UPAB: 20071026 NOVELTY - The {{component}} has an elastically deformable silicon membrane {{formed with}} a set of electrically conducting layers (3) to reflect an electromagnetic radiation. The membrane is <b>retained</b> or <b>clamped</b> on a radially outer edge by using a set of suspensions, where the membrane is integrated with an electrical resistance heating mechanism. A structural element e. g. depression, is utilized for structuring the membrane to form a discontinuous curve during deformation. An integrated element e. g. piezoresistive sensor, determines the deformation of the membrane. USE - Used in a confocal microscope for detecting a barcode or a two-dimensional (2 D) code, in an optical system that is utilized for focus tracking in compact disk appliance, digital versatile disc read/write appliance (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The structural element e. g. depression, is utilized for structuring the membrane to form a discontinuous curve during deformation, thus enabling desired deformation profile. The utilization of the elastically deformable silicon membrane provides a variation in the focal distance simply at a low cost...|$|R
40|$|The triad of hypothermia, acidosis, and {{coagulopathy}} in critically injured {{patients is}} {{a vicious cycle}} that, if uninterrupted, is rapidly fatal. During the past 7. 5 years, 200 patients were treated with unorthodox techniques to abruptly terminate the laparotomy and break the cycle. One hundred seventy patients (85 %) suffered penetrating injuries and 30 (15 %) were victims of blunt trauma. The mean Revised Trauma Score, Injury Severity Score, and Trauma Index Severity Score age combination index predicted survival were 5. 06 %, 33. 2 %, and 57 %, respectively. Resuscitative thoracotomies were performed in 60 (30 %) patients. After major sources of hemorrhage were controlled, the following clinical and laboratory mean values were observed: red cell transfusions [...] 22 units, core temperature [...] 32. 1 C, and pH [...] 7. 09. Techniques to abbreviate the operation included the ligation of enteric injuries in 34 patients, <b>retained</b> vascular <b>clamps</b> in 13, temporary intravascular shunts in four, packing of diffusely bleeding surfaces in 171, {{and the use of}} multiple towel clips to close only the skin of the abdominal wall in 178. Patients then were transported to the surgical intensive care unit for vigorous correction of metabolic derangements and coagulopathies. Ninety-eight patients (49 %) survived to undergo planned reoperation (mean delay 48. 1 hours), and 66 of 98 (67 %) survived to leave the hospital. With the exception of intravascular shunts, there were survivors who were treated by each of the unorthodox techniques. Of 102 patients who died before reoperation 68 (67 %) did so within 2 hours of the initial procedure. Logistic regression showed that red cell transfusion rate and pH may be helpful in determining when to consider abbreviated laparotomy. The authors conclude that patients with hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy are at high risk for imminent death, and that prompt termination of laparotomy {{with the use of the}} above techniques is a rational approach to an apparently hopeless situation...|$|R
