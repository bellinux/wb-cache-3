50|$|The {{connector}} is an insulation-displacement connector—in other words, each contact comprises a pair {{of points}} which together pierce the insulation of the ribbon cable with such precision that they make {{a connection to the}} desired conductor without harming the insulation on the neighboring wires. The center <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> are all connected to the common ground bus and attached to the odd numbered conductors of the cable. The top <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> are the even-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the even-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to every other even-numbered conductor of the cable. The bottom <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> are the odd-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the odd-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to the remaining even-numbered conductors of the cable.|$|E
50|$|The {{central office}} {{switching}} equipment has a two-motion stepping switch. A contact arm is {{moved up to}} select one <b>of</b> ten <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts,</b> and then rotated clockwise to select one <b>of</b> ten <b>contacts</b> in that <b>row,</b> a total <b>of</b> 100 choices. The stepping motion {{is controlled by the}} current pulses coming from the originating customer's telegraph keys, and later from the rotary dial.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} describes connectors {{which may}} have one, two or three <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts,</b> which are labelled as rows a, b and c. Two row connectors may use rows a+b or rows a+c. The connectors may have 16 or 32 columns, {{which means that the}} possible permutations allow 16, 32, 48, 64 or 96 contacts. The rows and columns are on a 0.1 inch (2.54 mm) grid pitch. Insertion and removal force are controlled, and three durability grades are available.|$|R
50|$|The {{connector}} {{contains two}} parallel <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> within a shielded case having a characteristic D-shape {{similar to that}} used in D-subminiature connectors. The contacts are not pins, but small flat bands of metal, called ribbon contacts. The connectors are manufactured in many capacities, including 14-, 24-, 36-, 50-, 64-, and 100- pin varieties. They may be mounted on boards, panels, or may terminate cables. Wires are attached by means of solder, crimping or insulation displacement. Female connectors have bail locks for a sturdy connection to the male connector. Screws may also be employed to secure connections.|$|R
50|$|A {{peripheral}} CompactPCI Serial slot {{only has}} a small connector with 6 <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> for power and signals. The remainder of a 3U single Eurocard is free for user-defined I/O and offers a total <b>of</b> 128 differential <b>contact</b> pairs or 384 contacts. This is significantly more than in 32-bit CompactPCI.6U double Eurocards provide the entire upper section of the board for user-defined I/O, as do PICMG 2.0 CompactPCI boards of this size. An advantage of the new architecture is that front and rear I/O boards are inserted directly into one another. By contrast to CompactPCI, no midplane or transfer connector is needed here, which reduces costs and increases system flexibility.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for storing and providing numerous coaxial lines for mounting on coaxial connectors, whereby the coaxial lines {{are placed in}} a row in parallel adjacent to each other on a support provided with grooves, and a handling unit and a controller are provided for inserting the coaxial lines in the support. The device consists of two parts and can be moved apart by said two parts. One part of the device is designed as a coaxial line receiving unit and the other part as a transport unit, whereby the transport unit for the coaxial lines is pressed onto the coaxial line placed in the coaxial line receiving unit by means <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> pressure. The coaxial line receiving unit is simultaneously designed as a displacement unit and is moved synchronously with the transport unit. The thickness of the coaxial line receiving unit is designed to be lower than the distance between at least two adjacent <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts,</b> pins or sockets of a coaxial connector, thus pe rmitting the assembly of coaxial connectors by the withdrawability of the coaxial line receiving unit, said coaxial connectors having several contacts, pins or sockets arranged in rows above each othe...|$|R

50|$|A metal disc {{containing}} {{a set of}} concentric rings of openings is fixed to an insulating disc, which is rigidly fixed to the shaft. A <b>row</b> <b>of</b> sliding <b>contacts</b> is fixed to a stationary object so that each contact wipes against the metal disc at a different distance from the shaft. As the disc rotates with the shaft, some <b>of</b> the <b>contacts</b> touch metal, while others fall in the gaps where the metal has been cut out. The metal sheet is connected to a source of electric current, and each contact is connected to a separate electrical sensor. The metal pattern is designed so that each possible position of the axle creates a unique binary code in which some <b>of</b> the <b>contacts</b> {{are connected to the}} current source (i.e. switched on) and others are not (i.e. switched off).|$|R
5000|$|The {{main point}} of ribbon cables {{is to allow}} mass {{termination}} to specially designed IDC connectors in which the ribbon cable is forced onto a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> sharp forked <b>contacts.</b> (The phrase [...] "IDC connector" [...] is widely used, {{even though it is}} redundant—an example of RAS syndrome.) Most commonly termination is done {{at both ends of the}} cable, although sometimes (for example, when making a lead that needs to change wiring between the two connectors) only one end will be IDC terminated, with the other end being terminated in a regular crimp or solder-bucket connection. Although it is sometimes possible to dismantle and re-use IDC connectors, they are not designed to allow this to be done easily.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The cell-substratum {{interaction}} was studied in cultures of osteoclasts {{isolated from the}} medullary bone of laying hens kept on low calcium diet. In fully spread osteoclasts, cellsubstratum adhesion mostly occurred within a continuous paramarginal area that corresponded also {{to the location of}} a thick network of intermediate filaments of the vimentin type. In this area, regular <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> short protrusions <b>contacting</b> the substratum and often forming a cup-shaped adhesion area were observed in the electron microscope. These short protrusions showed a core of F-actin-containing material presumably organized as a network of microfilaments and surrounded by a rosette-like structure in which vinculin and o~-actinin were found by immunofluorescence microscopy. Rosettes were superposable to dark circles in interference-reflection microscopy and thus represented circular forms <b>of</b> close cell-substratum <b>contact.</b> The core <b>of</b> ventral protrusions also contained, beside F-actin, fimbrin and a-actinin. Villin was absent. This form <b>of</b> cell-substratum <b>contact</b> occurring at the tip of a short ventral protrusion differed from other forms <b>of</b> cell-substratum <b>contact</b> and represented an osteoclastspecific adhesion device that might also be present in in vivo osteoclasts as well as in other normal and transformed cell types...|$|R
50|$|Serration {{generally}} {{refers to}} a saw-like appearance or a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> sharp or tooth-like projections. A serrated cutting edge has many small points <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> with the material being cut. By having less contact area than a smooth blade or other edge, the applied pressure at each point <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> is greater and the points <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> are at a sharper angle to the material being cut. This causes a cutting action that involves many small splits in {{the surface of the}} material being cut, which cumulatively serve to cut the material along the line of the blade.|$|R
40|$|The author {{investigated}} five residential {{units of}} an eight story high rise condominium building that had elevated indoor radon levels on every floor. The building had {{two levels of}} ventilated garages under most {{of the building and}} only partial ground contact. Each floor was constructed with post stressed concrete floors and ceilings. Blower door and ventilation dilution measurements in the units tested indicated very low air change rates to the exterior of the units. E-PERM’s ® were placed under three liter metal accumulator’s over exposed surfaces of the concrete in six locations of the building to determine the emanation rate from the concrete. The measurement results indicated the concrete radon emanation rate along with the low ventilation rates was the cause of the elevated indoor radon levels. GENERAL BUILDING INFORMATION The investigated building was actually two buildings above grade with three levels of open parking garages under most of the building. These garages are mechanically ventilated and open to each other. There is an alley way above the garages that separates the buildings. One side of the building is five stories tall. The other side is eight stories tall. There is a single <b>row</b> <b>of</b> ground <b>contact</b> condominiums and commercial stores surrounding three sides of the buildings. Both buildings are built with post stressed concrete slab floors and ceilings. The exterior and interior walls are metal stud framed except around the stairwell and elevator shafts which are concrete walls. There are multiple concrete beams throughout the building supporting the concrete slabs. See aerial photo of the site in Figure 1 below...|$|R
