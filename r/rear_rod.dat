5000|$|The {{steering}} linkage which connects the steering gearbox {{to the front}} wheels consists {{of a number of}} rods. These rods are connected with a socket arrangement similar to a ball joint, called a tie rod end, allowing the linkage to move back and forth freely so that the steering effort will not interfere with the vehicles up-and-down motion as the wheel moves over roads [...] The steering gears are attached to a <b>rear</b> <b>rod</b> which moves when the steering wheel is turned. The <b>rear</b> <b>rod</b> is supported at one end.|$|E
50|$|When {{possession}} of the ball switches to the other team, the forward rod becomes the <b>rear</b> <b>rod</b> and vice versa to minimize the distance the rod men have to move. However, {{at the end of}} the first and third quarters, when players switch directions on the field, the chain crew also moves (for example, a marker may move from one 32-yard line to the other 32-yard line). The <b>rear</b> <b>rod</b> man moves past the forward rod man and continues to mark the start of the series of downs, in the new orientation. The linesman and other officials supervise this movement, using one or more clips to exactly reposition the chains.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of a series of downs, the {{linesman}} stands so that the heel of one foot marks the initial line of scrimmage. The box man places his indicator to mark this position and sets the box to display [...] "1". The operator of the <b>rear</b> <b>rod</b> marks the same position, while the other rod man moves ten yards toward the defense's goal line to mark the line to gain.|$|E

50|$|After an {{intensive}} investigation, the probable {{cause of the}} crash was cited to be failure of the <b>rear</b> master <b>rod</b> bearing on the number three engine. The failure caused the rear crankpin to overheat and fail, whereupon all the <b>rear</b> connecting <b>rods</b> failed, tearing through the cylinder walls and crankcase. In the process, oil lines were torn open, which caused the fire. Sludge buildup in the crankpins, blocking oil flow {{was thought to be}} the root cause, which resulted in improved oil screens and the implementation of a crankpin plug, as well as revised oil change intervals.|$|R
25|$|During the 1960 model year, {{there were}} {{revisions}} to improve lubrication {{of the two}} <b>rear</b> connecting <b>rods,</b> voltage regulator function, cold starting and idling, acceleration, and to prevent breakage of {{the front and rear}} manifold mounting studs.|$|R
5000|$|Another [...] "rod man" [...] {{holds the}} [...] "forward rod" [...] ten yards toward the defense's {{goal-line}} from the <b>rear</b> <b>rod.</b> This marker indicates {{the line to}} gain, which the offense must reach in their series of four downs in order to retain possession of the ball. The two rods (sometimes known as [...] "sticks") are attached at the bottom by a chain exactly ten yards long. The chain is always taut so that the rods are ten yards apart.|$|E
5000|$|The linesman, the box man, or {{a fourth}} {{member of the}} chain crew {{attaches}} a [...] "clip" [...] to the chain to line up with the rear edge of the closest five-yard line to the <b>rear</b> <b>rod.</b> A device on the clip indicates which numbered line this is. The clip and the device let the chain crew restore {{the position of the}} rods after a mishap. In leagues such as the NFL with Instant Replay, there may be multiple clips to let the rods be repositioned after a play is reviewed and reversed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sharing of}} {{suspension}} and other components with other GM cars meant the rear suspension and powertrain was virtually {{identical to that}} of the Citation and Pontiac Phoenix; the Fiero even included <b>rear</b> tie <b>rod</b> ends attached to a [...] "steering knuckle", although these were hard-mounted to the engine cradle and only used for maintaining the rear tire alignment. The front suspension was derived from the Chevette, and Chevette enthusiasts found that they could upgrade their undersized front brakes and rotors using Fiero parts.|$|R
40|$|Adiabatic shearing, {{occuring}} at strain-rates above 103 s- 1, {{is expressed}} as a much critical thermo-plastic material instability, i. e., by the balance between only the two strain-rate hardening and thermal softening terms. The adiabatic temperature rise, calculated locally within the shear band, can be very high and reach a critical temperature for pressure induced phase transition or even melting, thus provoking material instability and eventually fracture.

2500|$|Under the bonnet, the car {{utilised}} the new Villiers Mk 35A unit {{designed specifically}} for it. A development of the 9E, the new engine incorporated numerous mechanical refinements to improve strength and reliability, albeit slightly {{at the cost of}} overall power, now rated at [...] at 4,500rpm. Rear suspension was completely revised, with trailing arm units controlled by Armstrong dampers. The rod and cable brake systems of previous cars was also replaced by a Lockheed semi hydraulic and rod braking system (front brake fully hydraulic, but <b>rear</b> brakes still <b>rod</b> operated from a central floor-mounted hydraulic cylinder) acting on all three wheels.|$|R
5000|$|... 1964 saw the {{introduction}} of the sporty Custom Sports Special. The Custom Sports Special included bucket seats, console, carpeting and racing stripes. The optional High Performance Package could be ordered with a CSS truck or by itself on a base model truck complete with Chrysler's big 426 cu in wedge-head V8. This engine produced 365 hp (272 kW) and 470 lbÂ·ft (637 NÂ·m)âin-line with the muscle car revolution that was then sweeping Detroit. The High Performance Package also included the LoadFlite automatic transmission, a 6000 rpm-rated Sun tachometer with heavy-duty gauges, power steering, dual exhaust and <b>rear</b> axle torque <b>rods</b> (traction bars) sourced from 1961 Imperials. Custom Sports Special trucks were produced from 1964 to 1967. The High Performance Package was only offered from 1964 to early 1966.|$|R
500|$|Despite his accident, Herbert {{suffered}} {{no physical}} injuries, {{except for a}} bruised left knee. He expressed disappointment in his late exit in his final Formula One race, saying that [...] "I'm pretty disappointed {{to have a good}} race ruined by a failure such as that." [...] Herbert left Formula One after 12 years with 161 race starts and 3 wins. Jaguar technical director Gary Anderson traced the suspension failure to a broken link on the <b>rear</b> right suspension <b>rod.</b> Herbert continued to participate in motor racing in 2001 driving in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the American Le Mans Series. He later abandoned plans to drive in CART and became a test driver for the Arrows team in February 2001. Diniz, meanwhile, could not find a race seat and became a shareholder in the Prost team to assist in helping the outfit become more competitive.|$|R

On the Ranger version the rear seats and rear side windows were omitted.|$|R
5000|$|The RPK {{also has}} a {{slightly}} longer receiver, by about 20 mm or less. This was done to decrease the fire rate slightly, but not significantly enough to lower it any less than 600 rounds per minute (RPM). The U-shaped receiver is stamped from a smooth 1.5 mm sheet of steel (compared to the 1.0 mm sheet metal receiver used on the standard AKM rifles. It uses a modified AKM recoil spring assembly, that consists of a <b>rear</b> spring guide <b>rod</b> from the AK and a new forward flat guide rod and coil spring. It features a thick laminated wood foregrip, and a fixed laminated wood [...] "club-foot" [...] buttstock, similar to the stock used on the RPD, {{which is designed to}} allow the user to fire from the prone position more comfortably. It uses a standard AKM pistol grip and can also use standard AKM detachable box magazines, but it is most commonly used with a 40-round box magazine or a 75-round drum magazine. Interchangeability of parts between the RPK and AKM are moderate.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an effort}} to extend a line growing {{obsolete}} {{in the face of}} advances in sports car design, Allard introduced an 'improved' model in late 1951, the J2X (extended). The chassis remained unchanged from the previous J2 (Tom Lush, Allard the inside story) but in an attempt to improve handling, the front suspension's <b>rear</b> attaching radius <b>rods</b> were redesigned with forward ones, which required a forward cross member and extending the nose out past the front wheels. This, in turn, allowed the engine to be moved forward, yielding more cockpit room. There is often confusion when it comes to identification of J2 and J2X types because they are seemingly very similar. However, the most obvious differences are that the J2 nose does not extend past the front tyres and has two vents below the grille, while the J2X nose has a more protruding chin with a single vent below the grille, which, as explained extends out past the front tyres. Allard historian Tom Lush, who was Sydney Allard's Personal Assistant and Allard employee from the beginning, said in his definitive book [...] "Allard: The Inside Story" [...] that the chin was the most obvious difference between the two models. In standard form the spare wheel was carried hidden on top of the rear-mounted fuel tank, but either version could carry one or two side mounted optional spares. This allowed the use of a 40 gallon long distance fuel tank.|$|R
