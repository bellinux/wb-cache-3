25|$|The surface {{reflectance}} {{of incoming}} solar radiation {{is important for}} the surface energy balance (SEB). It is the ratio of reflected to incident solar radiation, commonly referred to as albedo. Climatologists are primarily interested in albedo integrated over the shortwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (~300 to 3500nm), which coincides with the main solar energy input. Typically, albedo values for non-melting snow-covered surfaces are high (~80-90%) except in the case of forests. The higher albedos for snow and ice cause rapid shifts in surface reflectivity in autumn and spring in high latitudes, but the overall climatic significance of this increase is spatially and temporally modulated by cloud cover. (Planetary albedo is determined principally by cloud cover, and by the small amount of total solar radiation received in high latitudes during winter months.) Summer and autumn are times of high-average cloudiness over the Arctic Ocean so the albedo feedback associated with the large seasonal changes in sea-ice extent is greatly reduced. Groisman et al. (1994a) observed that snow cover exhibited the greatest influence on the Earth <b>radiative</b> <b>balance</b> in the spring (April to May) period when incoming solar radiation was greatest over snow-covered areas.|$|E

Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through {{a subset of the}} aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei.

They are said to be formed “when the atmospheric oxidation products of volatile organic compounds undergo gas-particle transfer.”The contribution of VOCs to the levels of SOA in the atmosphere have been modeled using simulation chamber experiments to gain a better understanding of the chemistry involved. SOAs are said to be a major causative factor to the mortality rates associated with the exposure to harmful fine particulate air pollution however there is an absence of in vitro particle exposure techniques to test for toxicity.

Below {{are a few of}} my current projects discussed in a bit of detail. Oceanic transport in a snowball Earth model scenario The goal for this modeling study is to investigate the role of oceanic heat transport in the event that the Earth is completely covered in ice, a so called ”Snowball Earth ” state. These events are speculated to have occurred in our planet’s distant past, and is interesting in climate dynamics because a completely ice covered Earth has a very high albedo, and the question arises of how the Earth could ever get out of such a state. The ocean is an important mechanism for redistributing heat on the planet, and we aim to study it’s role in a low complexity global climate model. In collaboration with my advisor, Dr. Juan Restrepo, and Dr. Doug Kurtze of St. Joseph’s University, we have developed a simple conceptual energy balance model for global climate dynamics.
