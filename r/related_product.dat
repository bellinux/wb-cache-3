25|$|The Apprentice was so {{successful}} that, according to Trump, he earned $214 million from 14 seasons of the show, plus more from <b>related</b> <b>product</b> licensing as his name as a brand became more valuable. As {{the popularity of the}} series grew, {{more and more of the}} tasks began to be tied to specific companies. For example, sales tasks would require a team to take over a brand-name storefront or restaurant and operate it; and marketing tasks would require teams to prepare a marketing material (e.g. a jingle or flyer) or campaign for an established company. In later series, the launches of specific products would be tied to the airing of episodes of the series. Several companies have appeared multiple times on the show.|$|E
500|$|In August 1942, Roosevelt {{appointed}} Conant to the Rubber Survey Committee. Chaired by Bernard M. Baruch, [...] {{a trusted}} adviser and confidant of Roosevelt, {{the committee was}} tasked with reviewing the synthetic rubber program. Corporations used patent laws to [...] restrict competition and stifle innovation. When the Japanese occupation of Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak, followed by the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, cut off 90 percent of the supply of natural rubber, [...] the rubber shortage became a national scandal, {{and the development of}} synthetic substitutes, an urgent priority. Baruch dealt with the difficult political issues; Conant concerned himself with the technical ones. There were a number of different synthetic rubber products to choose from. In addition to DuPont's neoprene, Standard Oil had licensed German patents for a copolymer called Buna-N and a <b>related</b> <b>product,</b> Buna-S. None had been manufactured on the scale now required, and there was pressure from agricultural interests to choose a process which involved making raw materials from farm products. The Rubber Survey Committee made a series of recommendations, including the appointment of a rubber director, and the construction and operation of 51 factories to supply the materials needed for synthetic rubber production. Technical problems dogged the program through 1943, but by late 1944 plants were in operation with an annual capacity of over a million tons, most of which was Buna-S.|$|E
