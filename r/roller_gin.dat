40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{discusses}} the pollution caused by Chrome Composite Leather-Clad (CCLC) rollers {{commonly used in}} cotton <b>roller</b> <b>ginning</b> industries and suggests an alternative roller material. The CCLC rollers contain about 18000 to 36000 mg/kg (ppm) total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms which are toxic and carcinogenic to human health. When the seed-cotton is processed in Double <b>Roller</b> (DR) <b>ginning</b> machines, the lint is contaminated with chromium of about 140 to 1990 ppm as against the safety limits of 0. 1 ppm. During the ginning process due to persistent rubbing of leather over stationary knife, chromium particles are carried into the lint such that the spun yarns and cotton by-products contain about 100 to 200 ppm, which according to world environmental standards should not be more than 0. 1 ppm. Gin and mill workers are directly exposed to this carcinogenic substance. To offset this problem, pollution-free Rubberized Cotton Fabric (RCF) rollers have been fabricated, used and experimented in <b>roller</b> <b>gins.</b> RCF <b>roller</b> covering is made of multiple layers of fabrics bonded together using white rubber compounding which has a surface finish conducive to high ginning efficiency. This nullifies chromium contamination and pollution during the ginning process.

5000|$|A cotton gin is {{a machine}} that quickly and easily {{separates}} cotton fibers from their seeds, allowing for much greater productivity than manual cotton separation. The fibers are then processed into various cotton goods such as linens, while any undamaged cotton is used largely for textiles like clothing. Seeds {{may be used to}} grow more cotton or to produce cottonseed oil. Handheld roller gins had been used in India and then other countries since at earliest 500 CE. The Indian worm-gear <b>roller</b> <b>gin,</b> invented some time around the sixteenth century, has, according to Lakwete, remained virtually unchanged up to the present time. A modern mechanical cotton gin was created by American inventor Eli Whitney in 1793 and patented in 1794. Whitney's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through, while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams. It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States, but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased. The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War. Modern automated cotton gins use multiple powered cleaning cylinders and saws, and offer far higher productivity than their hand-powered forebears.|$|E

The cotton <b>roller</b> <b>ginning</b> process is the mechanical separation of cotton fibres from their seeds by means of one or more rollers to which fibres adhere while the seeds are impeded and struck off or pulled loose. When the seed-cotton is ginned, due to persistent rubbing of CCLC rollers over the fixed knives, the ginned lint cotton adsorbs about 143 to 1990 mg/kg (ppm) as total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms and the cotton products carry with it of about 17 to 250 mg/kg (ppm) of chromium which according to Indian Standards (MOEF- 157, 1996) for yarn and fabrics, should not be more than 0. 1 mg/kg (ppm). Toxic effects are produced by prolonged contact with airborne or solid or liquid chromium compounds even in small quantities because of their properties viz. carcinogenecity, mutagenecity and corrosiveness. Traces of Cr (VI) are found even in analar grade trivalent compounds and complications do arise due to reduction in nature of these traces that affect the organic tissues of the body.

40|$|Impact of the ginning method on fiber {{quality and}} textile {{processing}} performance of Long Staple Upland cotton Marinus HJ van der Sluijs 1, 2 With the {{increased demand for}} quality {{and the production of}} finer, longer and stronger Upland cottons, an increasing proportion of these cottons are ginned on roller gins to preserve and improve fiber quality. However, although the benefits of roller ginning on lint turn out and fiber quality are fairly well understood, it is still unclear whether these improvements translate into improved yarn quality and processing performance. The aim of this research was to com-pare the impact of saw and roller ginning on Long Staple Upland cotton in a high-production and commercial environ-ment and to evaluate quality and textile processing performance in a commercial textile mill.

There is evidence that in his work on the enumeration of syllabic combinations, Pingala stumbled upon both the Pascal triangle and Binomial coefficients, although he did not have knowledge of the Binomial theorem itself. A description of binary numbers is also found in the works of Pingala. The Indians also developed the use of the law of signs in multiplication. Negative numbers and the subtrahend had been used in East Asia since the 2nd century BCE, and Indian mathematicians were aware of negative numbers by the 7th century CE, and their role in mathematical problems of debt was understood. Although the Indians were not the first to use the subtrahend, they were the first to establish the [...] "law of signs" [...] with regards to the multiplication of positive and negative numbers, which did not appear in East Asian texts until 1299. Mostly consistent and correct rules for working with negative numbers were formulated, and the diffusion of these rules led the Arab intermediaries to pass it on to Europe.|$|R
