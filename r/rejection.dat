5|$|After passing his exam, Woodruff {{entered his}} {{position}} at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery. Originally, {{he had planned}} to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Instead, Woodruff was given a place in the pathology laboratory where he studied transplant <b>rejection,</b> a process in which the immune system of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was particularly interested in thyroid allografts to the anterior chamber of the eye because they did not appear to meet with <b>rejection.</b> Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and <b>rejection.</b> To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of <b>rejection.</b> The two men discussed transplantation and <b>rejection,</b> beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against <b>rejection</b> sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal <b>rejection).</b> In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high <b>rejection</b> sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high <b>rejection</b> sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E

30|$|One {{interesting}} {{outcome in}} the direct comparison of CAC plots for hits and correct <b>rejections</b> in both experiments (Fig.  5) {{is that the}} CAC function is steeper for hits than for correct <b>rejections.</b> Correct <b>rejections</b> are much more accurate than hits at lower levels of confidence. The opposite occurs at the highest level: Hits display greater accuracy than correct <b>rejections.</b> In other words, subjects seem better calibrated in assessing hits than in assessing correct <b>rejections,</b> and for correct <b>rejections,</b> accuracy of their assessments does not change as much across confidence levels (Palmer, Brewer, Weber, & Nagesh, 2013).|$|R
40|$|The <b>rejections</b> of {{selected}} N-nitrosamines by commonly used high-pressure nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were quantitatively evaluated using a bench-scale cross-flow filtration apparatus. The selected nitrosamines included N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosomethylethylamine (NMEA), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR), N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosodi-n-butylamine (NDBA) and N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPHA). Nitrosamine <b>rejections</b> were evaluated {{under steady state}} at elevated feed concentrations, since NDMA <b>rejections</b> {{were found to be}} consistent with feed concentrations over three orders of magnitude. The steady-state nitrosamine <b>rejections</b> by NF membranes varied significantly, from 9 to 75 %, depending on nitrosamine compounds and tested membranes. For hydrophilic compounds, <b>rejections</b> increased with increasing molecular weight. The nitrosamine <b>rejections</b> by brackish RO membranes reached as high as 97 % for higher molecular weight nitrosamines. However, for low molecular weight nitrosamines such as NDMA, <b>rejections</b> as low as 54 % were observed. This low level of <b>rejections</b> was attributed to diffusive solute transport being more effective than convective transport. Physicochemical properties such as molecular weight and aqueous diffusivity showed reasonable correlations with nitrosamine permeability constants. M. S.

30|$|We {{examined}} the relationship of confidence in making correct <b>rejections</b> in our experiments, and we compared CAC plots for correct <b>rejections</b> with those with CAC plots of hits. The different scale types generally produced little or no difference among the proportions of correct <b>rejections</b> in either experiment. In general, the CAC plots are gently positive, with higher confidence leading to higher rates of correct <b>rejections.</b> Correct <b>rejections</b> were considerably lower and less confident in Experiment 1 (with words) than in Experiment 2 (with faces). This could be either because of inherent differences in recognizing words and faces, or because we selected lures for words to be highly associated with the target words, or because of both factors.|$|R
5|$|A {{more complex}} example of stepped {{impedance}} design {{is presented in}} figure 6. Again, narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has resonators connected in shunt across the main line. This topology {{can be used to}} design elliptical filters or Chebyshev filters with poles of attenuation in the stopband. However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as m-derived filters instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose of incorporating resonators is to improve the stopband <b>rejection.</b> However, beyond the resonant frequency of the highest frequency resonator, the stopband <b>rejection</b> starts to deteriorate as the resonators are moving towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter. This also ensures good <b>rejection</b> at high frequency.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe ceramic {{industry}} has witnessed fast growth in emerging {{and developing countries}} primarily due to growth in power, construction and housing sectors. The production of ceramic products can be divided in to two distinct phases: pre-kiln operations and post-kiln operations. The <b>rejections</b> in pre-kiln operations can be pushed back into the process without much loss to the environment. However, the post-kiln <b>rejections</b> cannot be recycled. Also, most of the energy is spent in the kiln process leading to high damage to environment. This paper presents {{a case study of}} {{ceramic industry}} to reduce the post-kiln <b>rejections</b> in the manufacturing of insulators for power sector. Ishikawa diagrams have been used to find the root causes of various <b>rejections</b> in post-kiln operations. The implementation of simple kaizens has led to more than 40 % reduction in post-kiln <b>rejections</b> thus saving energy and loss to environment...|$|R

40|$|When many (m) null {{hypotheses}} {{are tested}} {{with a single}} dataset, {{the control of the}} number of false <b>rejections</b> is often the principal consideration. Two popular controlling rates are the probability of making at least one false discovery (FWER) and the expected fraction of false discoveries among all <b>rejections</b> (FDR). Scaled multiple comparison error rates form a new family that bridges the gap between these two extremes. For example, the Scaled Expected Value (SEV) limits the number of false positives relative to an arbitrary increasing function of the number of <b>rejections,</b> that is, E(FP/s(R)). We discuss {{the problem of how to}} choose in practice which procedure to use, with elements of an optimality theory, by considering the number of false <b>rejections</b> FP separately from the number of correct <b>rejections</b> TP. Using this framework we will show how to choose an element in the new family mentioned above. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1112. 451...|$|R

40|$|Large {{quantities}} of sheet metal are consumed every month in various sectors of industry, the automotive, furniture, white and brown goods, electrical and body building (including coaches and containers) being the chief consumers. A {{large number of}} "critical" automotive sheet metal parts lead to <b>rejections</b> leading to wastage of sheet metal during manufacturing. Here, a product that permits a smaller window of variation in material properties compared to that permitted by the standards {{is said to be}} "critical". The wastage due to layout (utilization) of blanks on the sheet and that on account of <b>rejections</b> constitutes total wastage. While a number of algorithms are available to maximize sheet utilization and curtail the wastage, there appears to be none to minimize <b>rejections.</b> Thus, it will always be helpful to an industry to use a system capable of predicting and minimizing these <b>rejections</b> at the sheet layout stage. This paper views wastage in totality and attempts to minimize the total wastage arising from layout as well as <b>rejections.</b> Highly strained regions in a sheet metal blank are identified. Based on the permissible window of variation in the material properties, a 'defect map' is generated on the sheet. The blanks are laid out and the possible number of <b>rejections</b> is predicted probabilistically, leading to the prediction of the actual utilization of the material. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
