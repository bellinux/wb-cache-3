40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the developments of European building regulatory systems and place them {{within the context of}} general trends in the <b>regulatory</b> <b>sciences,</b> particularly with reference to Europeanisation studies. Within the <b>regulatory</b> <b>sciences</b> there is broad consensus about the trend towards deregulation and privatisation in recent decades. Studies conducted under the rubric of ‘Europeanisation’ analyse the effects of European policies on the policy frameworks of the member states in more detail. Are the systems converging or diverging? Although the history of this kind of research is short, most authors agree that European policies have {{had a profound impact on}} the policies of the member states, but that this impact has not been uniform. In this paper, we analyse privatisation and deregulation trends within the building regulatory systems of eight European countries, and we consider whether the systems appear to be converging or diverging. We focus on three elements: the scope of the technical requirements, the building-permit procedures and the division of control and inspection responsibilities. The analyses reveal no evidence that the scope of technical requirements in European countries is diminishing. Through its directives, the European Union exercises a convergent influence on the contents, scope, and formulation of these technical requirements. In addition, all member countries are taking steps to streamline their administrative procedures. The importance of the role played by private organisations in checking and controlling regulations is increasing across the board. Although they differ in pace and emphasis, these administrative deregulation and privatisation trends exhibit a number of parallel developments. ...|$|R

These tools offer the opportunity to evaluate multiple hypotheses and provide a means to identify, quantify, and understand relevant sources of variability, to optimize translation and clinical trial design.

Method: We employed a prospective intervention study with a control group. The patients ranging in age from 60 to 74, were using one of the six selected community pharmacies in the Tokyo metropolitan area. They had been prescribed six or fewer kinds of medications, one of which was amlodipine. The medication dosages covered 1 month or longer. Patients who {{agreed to participate in the}} study were randomly assigned to the groups at each pharmacy. For the patients in the intervention group, the pharmacists provided telephone counseling between physician visits, in addition to the time they visited the pharmacies to collect their medications. For the patients in the control group, the pharmacists provided counseling only at their pharmacies. Results and discussion: The average days of medication administration were 49. 2 days for the 58 patients in the intervention group, and 49. 8 days for the 53 patients in the control group, with the average number of medications being 3. 4 items per person for both groups. Through the telephone counseling, we were able to collect more information, eg, changes in physical condition and occurrences of side effects, from the intervention group than from the control group. The rate of incident detection in the information from the intervention group was five times that of the control group, making subsequent incident resolutions faster. Conclusion: This study suggested that phone counseling between physician visits could enable the identification of more issues regarding patients’ conditions.

[3] as adequate evidence for questioning the safety of NK 603 maize and its glyphosate-based co-technology. In our comparative analysis based on four out of five criteria of EFSA, we found the studies of Monsanto [12] and Hammond et al. [14] submitted as evidence for proving the safety of NK 603 maize to suffer from comparable deficiencies. We did find critical double standards in acceptance and rigor of the evaluation of feeding studies submitted as proof of safety for regulatory approval to EFSA. We further conclude that during 23  years of EU regulation for GM organisms and various GM crop risk assessments and approvals, <b>regulatory</b> <b>sciences</b> and methodology are used that were developed under the contrasting US regulatory concept. It is this mismatch between these different legal frameworks and the choice of risk assessment methodology that we see to be the basis of the often-stated public mistrust in the EU authorities. Only recently, the EU authorities started to build up an implementing system that takes its directives from the current EU legislation and is supportive of its own approach. Concerns about the intransparent and arbitrary use of reference controls as instrument to state biological irrelevance of significant differences between GM organisms and its parents must be addressed in these ongoing activities. Activities of prime concern in this regard is the GMO Risk Assessment and Communication of Evidence (GRACE) Project [65] developing protocols for 90 -day rat feeding trials with GM plants and certainly influencing the suggested development of respective 2 -year testing protocols with rats. But until now, the GRACE Project adheres to the intransparent use of reference varieties. Until the scientific questions with regard to appropriate risk research and assessment are resolved and the application of double standards has ceased, we do not expect that neither the public nor the scientific debate will subside.|$|R

Thus, these patients are likely to take glimepiride and rosuvastatin concomitantly. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between these two drugs in healthy males and to explore the effect of SLCO 1 B 1 and CYP 2 C 9 polymorphisms on their interactions in two randomized, open-label crossover studies. Glimepiride was studied in part 1 and rosuvastatin in part 2. Twenty-four participants {{were randomly assigned to}} each part. All subjects (n= 24) completed part 1, and 22 subjects completed part 2. A total of 38 subjects among the participants of the PK interaction studies were enrolled in the genotype study to analyze their SLCO 1 B 1 and CYP 2 C 9 polymorphisms retrospectively (n= 22 in part 1, n= 16 in part 2). Comparison of the PK and safety of each drug alone with those of the drugs in combination showed that both glimepiride and rosuvastatin did not interact with each other and had tolerable safety profiles in all subjects. However, with regard to glimepiride PK, the SLCO 1 B 1 521 TC group had a significantly higher maximum plasma concentration (Cmax,ss) and area under the plasma concentration–time curve during the dose interval at steady state (AUCt,ss) for glimepiride in combination with rosuvastatin than those for glimepiride alone. However, other significant effects of the SLCO 1 B 1 or CYP 2 C 9 polymorphism on the interaction between the two drugs were not observed. In conclusion, there were no significant PK interactions between the two drugs; however, the exposure to glimepiride could be affected by rosuvastatin {{in the presence of the}} SLCO 1 B 1 polymorphism.
