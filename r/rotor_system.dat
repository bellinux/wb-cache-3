40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{literature}} survey and review is model reduction methods and their application to <b>rotor</b> dynamic <b>systems.</b> <b>Rotor</b> dynamic <b>systems</b> require careful consideration in their dynamic models as they include unsymmetric stiffness, localized nonproportional damping, and frequency-dependent gyroscopic effects. The literature reviewed originates from both controls and mechanical systems analysis and has been previously applied to <b>rotor</b> <b>systems.</b> This survey discusses the previous literature reviews on model reduction, reduction methods applied to <b>rotor</b> <b>systems,</b> {{the current state of}} these reduction methods in rotor dynamics, and the ability of the literature to reduce the complexities of large order <b>rotor</b> dynamic <b>systems</b> but allow accurate solutions...|$|R

50|$|Before {{development}} of powered helicopters {{in the mid}} 20th century, autogyro pioneer Juan de la Cierva researched and developed many of the fundamentals of the rotor. De la Cierva is credited with successful {{development of}} multi-bladed, fully articulated <b>rotor</b> <b>systems.</b> This system, in its various modified forms, {{is the basis of}} most multi-bladed helicopter <b>rotor</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
40|$|A set of {{adaptive}} liquid-friction bearings {{is designed to}} ensure a reliable and qualitative operation of <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> under intensive operating conditions. Therefore, a field of application for such bearings is broad and ranges from the standard semiautomatic machines with a constant grinding wheel rotational speed to the flexible modules with an adaptive control system. Work specifics of <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> with adaptive liquid-friction bearings of a new design analysed in the paper. Experimental research equipment and principle at its work are described. Experimental researches and computer calculations of <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> with adaptive liquid-friction bearings are performed with purpose to define the influence of different factors on work quality of these systems...|$|R

25|$|The basic {{airframe}} {{came from}} an early post-World War II commercial airplane program for a four-place airplane in the Bonanza and Navion class. McDonnell enlisted Kurt Hohenemser and Friedrich von Doblhoff, the Austrian helicopter designer of the WNF 342, to provide technical direction in developing the tip-jet driven <b>rotor</b> <b>system.</b> After 22 months of fabrication, the first aircraft (serial 53-4016) was ready for flight testing by early 1954.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{intended}} to be a simplified helicopter. Constructed by two brothers with no prior aeronautical experience or skills it employed a unique coaxial, counter-rotating, fixed pitch <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> with no collective control, but employed a rudder. To account {{for the fact that the}} aircraft could not autorotate after a power failure, it was equipped with two engines and could hover on either one. A ballistic parachute was optional.|$|E
25|$|The rotor {{is mounted}} atop the {{vertical}} mast. The <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> of all Bensen-type autogyros is of a two-blade teetering design. There are some disadvantages {{associated with this}} rotor design, but {{the simplicity of the}} rotor design lends itself to ease of assembly and maintenance {{and is one of the}} reasons for its popularity. Aircraft-quality birch was specified in early Bensen designs, and a wood/steel composite is used in the world speed record holding Wallis design. Gyroplane rotor blades are made from other materials such as aluminium and GRP-based composite blades.|$|E

Such technologies can include compliant-surface gas bearings, magnetic bearings, and advanced solid lubricants and tribo-materials. This presentation briefly reviews critical technology developments {{and the current}} state-of-the-art, emerging Oil-Free <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> and discusses obstacles preventing more widespread use.

Damping can be a major stabilizing influence for these conditions, and a method of introducing damping in the flexbeam would allow for greater aeromechanical stability. Distributed and point damping strategies are currently being investigated to this end...|$|R
25|$|The AH-1T+ {{demonstrator}} and AH-1W prototype {{were later}} tested {{with a new}} experimental composite four-blade main <b>rotor</b> <b>system.</b> The new system offered better performance, reduced noise and improved battle damage tolerance. Lacking a USMC contract, Bell developed this new design into the AH-1Z with its own funds. By 1996, the Marines were again not allowed to order the AH-64. Developing a marine version of the Apache would have been expensive and it was likely that the Marine Corps would be its only customer. They instead signed a contract for upgrading AH-1Ws into AH-1Zs.|$|E
25|$|The BK 117 was a joint {{development}} between MBB and Kawasaki {{based on an}} agreement made on 25 February 1977. The agreement would replace two separate projects for twin-engined general purpose helicopters; the Bo 107 by MBB and the KH-7 from Kawasaki. Costs were shared equally, with MBB developing the rotors (based on the rigid <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> used on MBB's Bo 105), tailboom, flight controls and hydraulic system and Kawasaki developing the landing gear, airframe, main transmission and other minor components. Each company would have its own assembly line producing aircraft for local markets.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the design was revised with the {{introduction}} of the Fenestron tail <b>rotor</b> <b>system,</b> an advanced rigid main rotor, composite materials, and resonance isolation systems. It was decided to pursue a full certification program, resulting in the production of two pre-production prototypes; at the same time, it was chosen to give the Bo 108 a new designation of EC135 to correspond with the newly created Eurocopter company. At this point, it was decided that the EC135 should be developed with the option of being powered by two competing engines, the Turbomeca Arrius 2B and the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW206B engines; two pre-production prototypes were built in 1994 powered by either engine, both powerplants proved to be successful and were used on subsequent production aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Wind-tunel {{testing of}} a {{properly}} scaled aeroelastic model helicopter rotor {{is considered a}} necessary phase in the design development of new or existing <b>rotor</b> <b>systems.</b> For this reason, extensive testing of aeroelastically scaled model rotors {{is done in the}} Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) located at the NASA Langley Research Center. A unique capability of this facility, which enables proper dynamic scaling, is the use of Freon as a test medium. A description of the TDT and a discussion of the benefits of using Freon as a test medium are presented. A description of the model test bed used, the Aeroelastic <b>Rotor</b> Experimental <b>System</b> (ARES), is also provided and examples of recent rotor tests are cited to illustrate the advantages and capabilities of aeroelastic model rotor testing in the TDT. The importance of proper dynamic scaling in identifying and solving rotorcraft aeroelastic problems, and the importance of aeroelastic testing of model <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> in the design of advanced <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> are demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} to study system vibration characteristics for improving product quality and ensuring safety operation of units. In this paper, some dynamics of <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> are studied in large centrifugal compressor. The models of diaphragm coupling and tilting pad bearing are established by appropriate simplification. The finite element model of rotors with bearing and coupling is set up by taking interrelation of these subsystems into account. The unbalance responses of journal are computed based on the relative standard. The effect of bearing parameters (length-diameter ratio, clearance ratio and lubricating oil number) to journal vibration of <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> is analyzed. Finally test results and theoretical results are compared and errors are analyzed. The research results will provide theoretical basis for improving the bearing design of compressor <b>rotor</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
50|$|The mast is a {{cylindrical}} {{metal shaft}} that extends upwards from the transmission. At {{the top of}} the mast is the attachment point for the rotor blades called the hub. The rotor blades are attached to the hub. Main <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> are classified according to how the rotor blades are attached and move relative to the hub. There are three basic types: hingeless, fully articulated, and teetering; although some modern <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> use a combination of these.|$|R
2500|$|The {{existing}} two-bladed semi-rigid, teetering <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> {{is being}} {{replaced with a}} four-bladed, hingeless, bearingless composite <b>rotor</b> <b>system.</b> The improvement in flight characteristics provided by the four-bladed configuration has led to increases in flight envelope, maximum speed, vertical rate-of-climb, payload and [...] reduced rotor vibration. The <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> has 75% fewer parts than that of four-bladed articulated systems, and the improved yokes allow for weight saving with {{the elimination of all}} bearings, hinges, and vibration absorbers in the rotor hub. The blades are made of carbon fiber-based composites, which have an increased ballistic survivability, and there is a semiautomatic folding system for stowage aboard Amphibious assault ships. Both helicopters will receive an upgraded, four-blade tail rotor and drive system.|$|E
2500|$|Bell {{participated in}} a joint Bell-Government {{integrated}} test team during the engineering manufacturing development (EMD) phase of the H-1 program. The AH-1Z program progressed slowly from 1996 to 2003 largely as a research and development operation. [...] The existing two-blade semi-rigid, teetering <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> is being replaced with a four-blade, hingeless, bearingless <b>rotor</b> <b>system.</b> The four-blade configuration provides improvements in flight characteristics including increased flight envelope, maximum speed, vertical rate of climb, payload and reduced rotor vibration level.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Sikorsky began {{designing}} the S-60 as a prototype [...] "flying crane" [...] helicopter. The S-60 utilized the transmission, <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> and piston engines from the CH-37/S-56.|$|E

The aircraft can be fitted to fly as a conventional rotary-wing aircraft, fixed-wing aircraft, or compound helicopter, and is designed for testing existing and future <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> in flight. Controls include full-authority fly-by-wire controls and mechanical controls for rotary wing and for fixed wing. Stability augmentation, <b>rotor</b> test measurement <b>systems,</b> variable center of gravity capability, and rotor loading potential of the RSRA are also described...|$|R
40|$|Fault {{detection}} and isolation (FDI) in <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> often faces {{the problem that}} the system dynamics {{is dependent on the}} rotor rotary frequency because of the gyroscopic effect. In unbalance excited <b>rotor</b> <b>systems,</b> the continuously distributed unbalances are hard to be determined or estimated accurately. The unbalance forces as disturbances make fault detection more complicated. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop linear time invariant (LTI) FDI methods (i. e., with constant parameters) for <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> under consideration of gyroscopic effect and disturbances. Two approaches to describe the gyroscopic effect, that is, as unknown inputs and as model uncertainties, are investigated. Based on these two approaches, FDI methods are developed and the results are compared regarding the resulting FDI performances. Results are obtained by the application in a rotor test rig. Restrictions for the application of these methods are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{capabilities}} of genetic algorithms as a non-calculus based, global search method make them potentially {{useful in the}} conceptual design of <b>rotor</b> <b>systems.</b> Coupling reasonably simple analysis tools to the genetic algorithm was accomplished, and the resulting program was used to generate designs for <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> to match requirements {{similar to those of}} both an existing helicopter and a proposed helicopter design. This provides a comparison with the existing design and also provides insight into the potential of genetic algorithms in design of new rotors...|$|R
