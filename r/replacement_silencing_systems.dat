40|$|In a {{situation}} where traffic, railway or aircraft noise sources are not present, as it happens in shielded areas, other sources might become relevant in terms of annoyance. This {{is the case of}} typical turbomachinery elements, such as fans, compressors or turbines, where sound is generated aerodynamically. As a part of the Sonorus project, where all noise sources in urban environments are considered, the goal of this research is to develop an auralization tool that generates a time domain signal depending on the fan working conditions and the propagation scenario. In this paper, a computational aero-acoustics solver is used to simulate the flow field generated by an axial fan, and the acoustic field is calculated using the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings method. The information contained in this acoustic field is used to generate an audio signal for auralization purposes. The model results are evaluated by comparisons with recordings and measurements. © 2016, German Acoustical Society (DEGA). All rights reserved.

Here we show that PIWI, an ARGONAUTE/PIWI protein family member that binds to Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), strongly and specifically interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 a (HP 1 a), a central player in heterochromatic gene silencing. The HP 1 a dimer binds a PxVxL-type motif in the N-terminal domain of PIWI. This motif is required in fruit flies for normal silencing of transgenes embedded in heterochromatin. We also demonstrate that PIWI, like HP 1 a, is itself a chromatin-associated protein whose distribution in polytene chromosomes overlaps with HP 1 a and appears to be RNA dependent. These findings implicate a direct interaction between the PIWI-mediated small RNA mechanism and heterochromatin-forming pathways in determining the epigenetic state of the fly genome...|$|R

Silencing of horizontally-acquired {{genes in the}} bacterium Escherichia coli {{is caused by the}} global transcriptional repressor H-NS. The activity of H-NS is enhanced or diminished by other proteins including its homologue StpA, and Hha and YdgT. The interconnections of H-NS with these regulators and their role in silencing gene expression in E. coli are not well understood on a genomic scale. In this study, we use transcriptome sequencing to show that there is a bi-layered gene <b>silencing</b> <b>system</b> - involving the homologous H-NS and StpA - operating on horizontally-acquired genes among others. We show that H-NS-repressed genes belong to two types, termed ``epistatic'' and ``unilateral''. In the absence of H-NS, the expression of ``epistatically controlled genes'' is repressed by StpA, whereas that of ``unilaterally controlled genes'' is not. Epistatic genes show a higher tendency to be non-essential and recently acquired, when compared to unilateral genes. Epistatic genes reach much higher expression levels than unilateral genes {{in the absence of the}} <b>silencing</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, epistatic genes contain more high affinity H-NS binding motifs than unilateral genes. Therefore, both the DNA binding sites of H-NS as well as the function of StpA as a backup system might be selected for silencing highly transcribable genes...|$|R

Inv mutant mice show consistently reversed internal organs (situs inversus), multiple renal cysts and neonatal lethality. The Inv::GFP-rescue mice, which introduced the Inv::GFP fusion gene, can rescue inv mutant mice phenotypes. This indicates that the Inv::GFP gene is functional in vivo. To analyze the physiological functions of the Inv gene, and to demonstrate the availability of transgenic RNAi mice, we introduced a short hairpin RNA expression vector against GFP mRNA into Inv::GFP-rescue mice and analyzed the gene silencing effects and Inv functions by examining phenotypes. Transgenic RNAi mice with the Inv::GFP-rescue gene (Inv-KD mice) down-regulated Inv::GFP fusion protein and showed hypomorphic phenotypes of inv mutant mice, such as renal cyst development, but not situs abnormalities or postnatal lethality. This indicates that shRNAi-mediated gene <b>silencing</b> <b>systems</b> that target the tag sequence of the fusion gene work properly in vivo, and suggests that a relatively high level of Inv protein is required for kidney development in contrast to left/right axis determination.

40|$|The {{definition}} of a disease is fundamentally difficult, even if one considers only genetically based diseases. In its broadest sense, disease {{can be defined as}} any deviation from the norm that results in a physiological disadvantage. Natural selection ensures that the norm for any given species is constantly changing. In addition, some disadvantages are latent and might only manifest under certain environmental conditions. Conversely, an apparent disadvantage can carry a benefit, for example, the disease sickle-cell anemia that is an advantage in malarial areas. Because of the difficulties in giving disease a precise definition, in this review, gene silencing-based disease resistance will be restricted to the description of gene inactivation processes that contribute to maintain the physical fitness of an organism. In this sense, we are concerned with the elimination of invasive nucleic acid expressing. In numerous organisms, a variety of severe diseases are caused by the attack of invasive nucleic acids such as viruses and retroviral or transposable elements. Organisms have developed diverse mechanisms to defend themselves against such attack that include immune responses and apoptosis. Fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates also enlist gene <b>silencing</b> <b>systems</b> to counteract the harmful effects of invasive nucleic acids. In particular, plants that lack interferon and immune responses have established efficient transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene <b>silencing</b> <b>systems.</b> In this review, we describe how plants defend against invasive nucleic acids and focus on the continual evolutionary battle between plants and viruses. In addition, the importance of controlling transposon activity is outlined.

40|$|Background: Introduction of a {{transgene}} that transcribes RNA homologous to an endogenous gene in {{the plant}} genome can induce silencing of both genes, a phenomenon termed cosuppression. Cosuppression was first discovered in transgenic petunia plants transformed with the CHS-A gene encoding chalcone synthase, in which nonpigmented sectors in flowers or completely white flowers are produced. Some of the flower-color patterns observed in transgenic petunias having CHS-A cosuppression resemble those in existing nontransgenic varieties. Although the mechanism by which white sectors are generated in nontransgenic petunia {{is known to be}} due to RNA silencing of the CHS-A gene as in cosuppression, whether the same trigger(s) and/or pattern of RNA degradation are involved in these phenomena has not been known. Here, we addressed this question using deep-sequencing and bioinformatic analyses of small RNAs. Results: We analyzed short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced in nonpigmented sectors of petal tissues in transgenic petunia plants that have CHS-A cosuppression and a nontransgenic petunia variety Red Star, that has naturally occurring CHS-A RNA silencing. In both <b>silencing</b> <b>systems,</b> 21 -nt and 22 -nt siRNAs were the most and the second-most abundant size classes, respectively. CHS-A siRNA production was confined to exon 2, indicating that RNA degradation through the RNA silencing pathway occurred in this exon. Common siRNAs were detected in cosuppression and naturally occurring RNA silencing, and their ranks {{based on the number of}} siRNAs in these plants were correlated with each other. Noticeably, highly abundant siRNAs were common in these systems. Phased siRNAs were detected in multiple phases at multiple sites, and some of the ends of the regions that produced phased siRNAs were conserved. Conclusions: The features of siRNA production found to be common to cosuppression and naturally occurring silencing of the CHS-A gene indicate mechanistic similarities between these <b>silencing</b> <b>systems</b> especially in the biosynthetic processes of siRNAs including cleavage of CHS-A transcripts and subsequent production of secondary siRNAs in exon 2. The data also suggest that these events occurred at multiple sites, which can be a feature of these silencing phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Genetics. Plant Biotechnology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The main aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis was to further {{our understanding of the}} role of Pyrrophosphate: fructose 6 -phosphate 1 -phosphotransferase (PFP) in sugarcane, by specifically investigating its potential contribution to phloem metabolism. PFP activity in sugarcane internodal tissue is inversely correlated to sucrose content across varieties that differ in their sucrose accumulation abilities. This apparent correlation is in contrast to previous studies that suggest PFP plays an insignificant role in metabolism. In {{the first part of this}} study an immunological characterisation of the two subunits of sugarcane PFP was conducted to establish whether it differ significantly from other plant species in terms of size and distribution. Both the alpha and beta subunit appears to be approximately sixty kilo Daltons in size and uniform in their relative distribution to each other in the various plant organs of sugarcane. Although the observed alpha subunit size is less than that predicted this could be explained at the hand of post translational modification, in essence the sugarcane PFP subunits appear similar than that described for other plants especially that of tobacco which was employed as a model system later on in this study. The only direct way to investigate PFP’s contribution to phloem metabolism is to alter its activity by recombinant DNA technologies. Therefore, in the second part of the study transformation systems were designed for both the constitutive and phloem specific downand up-regulation of PFP activity. For the down-regulation of activity a post transcriptional gene <b>silencing</b> <b>system,</b> i. e. a complementary strand intron hairpin RNA (ihpRNA) <b>silencing</b> <b>system,</b> was employed.

Transgene insertion was accomplished by means of Agobacterium mediated transformation and tissue specific manipulation of PFP activity was confirmed by in situ activity staining...|$|R

Strikingly, the efficiency of the catalase silencing appeared to be correlated with the zygosity of the primary target locus and, to a lesser extent, with that of the silencing-inducing locus. These data suggest that silencing of an endogene induced by transgenic secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) might depend on the amount of primary target transcripts that can act as template for the production of an efficient transitive silencing signal...|$|R
