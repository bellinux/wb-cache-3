25|$|Fiery Cross {{had been}} the first tea clipper home in 1861, 1862, 1863 and 1865. As a {{slightly}} older ship, built in 1860, she predated the widespread acceptance of composite construction, so was built of wood. Nevertheless, she was full of the latest technology; for example steel masts and Cunningham's patent roller <b>reefing</b> topsails and t'gallants.|$|E
25|$|Speed was profit, and so {{in summer}} the sails were made of cotton, and in winter of flax. There were four sets of <b>reefing</b> points, with later designs {{encompassing}} roller-reefing, which although bringing its own boat handling issues meant that {{the chances of a}} broken boom crippling the boat were low. The size, scale and number of any headsails were a captain's personal choice, but were often be used to fool other pilots into thinking that they were being passed by a fishing boat, or as a signature to be recognised by approaching cargo boat captains.|$|E

2500|$|Slocum {{normally}} sailed the Spray {{without touching}} the helm. Due {{to the length}} of the sail plan relative to the hull, and the long keel, the Spray was capable of self-steering (unlike faster modern craft), and he balanced it stably on any course relative to the wind by adjusting or <b>reefing</b> the sails and by lashing the helm fast. He sailed [...] west across the Pacific without once touching the helm.|$|E
2500|$|Oriskany was {{the first}} United States warship slated to become an {{artificial}} reef, under authority granted by the fiscal 2004 National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 108-136). Oriskany was towed to Pensacola in December 2004 and was originally scheduled to be sunk with controlled charges [...] south of Pensacola by June 2005. Exhaustive ecological and human health studies were conducted by Navy scientists {{in consultation with the}} Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to demonstrate no adverse impact from <b>reefing</b> the ship. Failure to gain EPA [...] approval caused a delay, so Oriskany was then towed back to Texas in June to ride out the 2005 hurricane season. [...] Completion and peer review of a complex Prospective Risk Assessment Model developed in consultation with EPA, the first for any ship <b>reefing</b> project, was necessary to support EPA's February 2006 decision to issue a risk-based PCB disposal approval for the estimated 750lb (340kg) of polychlorinated biphenyls contained in solid form, mostly integral in the insulation layers of the electrical cabling throughout the ship.|$|E
50|$|The fish {{attracted}} {{and brought}} in to the artificial <b>reef</b> zones vary from <b>reef</b> to <b>reef,</b> and many times artificial <b>reefs</b> do in fact attract more fish than natural surrounding <b>reefs.</b> The fish that the <b>reef</b> will attract depends largely on the age, size {{and structure of the}} artificial <b>reef.</b> Different <b>reefs</b> attract different types of fish and large <b>reef</b> structures like the artificial <b>reefs</b> created by sinking large ships attract larger fish. In addition to attracting certain fish based on the structure of the artificial <b>reef,</b> the structure of the natural existing <b>reef</b> effects the impact of the artificial <b>reef</b> as well.|$|R

2500|$|The {{single storey}} {{octagonal}} brick base was [...] from floor {{level to the}} top of the brickwork internally.

The brickwork tapered in thickness, being [...] thick at the top. It was [...] across the flats. By 2006 the base was the only remaining part of the mill, although largely hidden by dense undergrowth.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was built}} in 1900 by Ferguson and Baird at their Connah's Quay, Flintshire yard, for local {{shipping}} company Coppack Bros. Constructed with a doubled frame of oak, these were covered by [...] thick seasoned pitch pine planks, fastened to the frames with treenails and iron bolts. Equipped with the first known fitting of Appledore roller <b>reefing,</b> the sails are reefed by a ratchet lever that engaged the cogs on the Gaff boom, thereby winding the sail around it, and then locked to prevent the sail unwinding from the boom. Launched in April 1900 under Captain John Coppack, she was named Lizzie May after the Captain’s daughters.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Reefs</b> {{can develop}} {{vertically}} {{as far as}} the space below the surface allows. The <b>reef</b> generally grows upward from a starting point towards the surface. Once the <b>reef</b> crest reaches sea level the <b>reef</b> may begin growing seaward. Growth begins after flooding, mostly from parts of the <b>reef</b> that have died. Because the <b>reef</b> grows upward, the oldest sediments are found lower in the <b>reef.</b> The <b>reef</b> flat's age indicates when the <b>reef</b> reached sea level. Catch-up <b>reefs</b> have younger surfaces than keep-up <b>reefs</b> of this type.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Reefs</b> {{can form}} in a gradual, {{sporadic}} manner, with alternate {{vertical and horizontal}} growth episodes.

40|$|In the Late Triassic (~ 235 – 201. 3 Ma) scleractinian corals and hypercalcified sponges built large, diverse <b>reef</b> ecosystems, {{the most}} famous of which are the Dachstein <b>reefs.</b> This study {{presents}} a depth transect along an Upper Triassic (lower Rhaetian) Dachstein <b>reef</b> from the Gosausee margin of the Dachsteingebirge (Gosau, Austria). The Gosausee microbial-sponge-coral <b>reef</b> is a complete barrier <b>reef</b> with an almost continuous fore <b>reef</b> to lagoon transect preserved (a very rare occurrence for the Triassic), and thus provides a window into depth zonation of Dachstein-type <b>reef</b> facies and biotic succession. The Gosausee <b>reef</b> facies exhibit strong depth control and five classic <b>reef</b> facies or zones are identified: the fore <b>reef,</b> <b>reef</b> front, <b>reef</b> crest, back <b>reef,</b> and lagoon facies. Thin, rare microbial fabrics and a high abundance of fine-grained, mud-rich skeletal wackestones (transported <b>reef</b> debris) characterize the deepest fore <b>reef.</b> As the <b>reef</b> shallows, muddy sediments decrease in abundance and are replaced by microbial fabrics, corals, and cements. Abundant sponges, microbial crusts, and thick, marine cements typify the <b>reef</b> crest, whereas microbialite-coated phaceloid corals are dominant in the back <b>reef</b> facies. Heavily cemented oncoids or microbial-sponge bindstones are characteristic of the lagoon. Based on their compositional and biotic similarities, the Gosausee <b>reef</b> was likely part of the same barrier <b>reef</b> systems as the source <b>reef</b> for the Gosaukamm <b>reef</b> breccia (one of the classic Norian–Rhaetian Dachstein <b>reefs).</b> The <b>reef</b> zones of the Gosausee margin can be used to interpret the depth or <b>reef</b> zone of less well preserved <b>reef</b> fragments, can inform models of community ecology and niche utilization in the Late Triassic, and highlight the need for additional research into the environmental factors that controlled biotic distribution in Upper Triassic <b>reefs...</b>|$|R
50|$|These biotic <b>reef</b> types take on {{additional}} names {{depending upon}} how the <b>reef</b> lies {{in relation to}} the land, if any. <b>Reef</b> types include fringing <b>reef,</b> barrier <b>reefs,</b> as well as atolls. A fringing <b>reef</b> is a <b>reef</b> that is attached to an island. A barrier <b>reef</b> forms a calcareous barrier around an island resulting in a lagoon between the shore and the <b>reef.</b> An atoll is a ring <b>reef</b> with no land present. The <b>reef</b> front (ocean side) is a high energy locale whereas the internal lagoon will be at a lower energy with fine grained sediments.|$|R
