40|$|In {{this work}} the potencial of cork waste to remove Cu (II) and Cr (VI) from aqueous {{solutions}} has been studied. <b>Raw</b> <b>cork</b> and biochar prepared by pyrolysis of the cork, were used. Kinetic and equilibrium batch sorption experiments were performed {{in order to}} compare the sorption efficiency of each material. Adsorption isotherms were expressed by Langmuir and Freundlich equilibrium models. Moreover the batch kinetic experiments were fitted to the commonly pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order equations. The {{results showed that the}} metal removal using <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> as the sorbent is pH-dependent with the uptake of 61. 5 % for chromium at pH 3 and 55. 6 % for copper at pH 6. Two types of cork size (0. 5 mm and 2 mm particle size) showed the same adsorption potential. Biochar with high specific surface area (300 m 2 g- 1) can be easily prepared from the <b>raw</b> <b>cork.</b> The <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> results show that pseudo-second-order describe better kinetic data for both metals. According to kinetic data the adsorption of chromium using biochar is the best option for removing this metal from water. Biochar is able to sorb copper and chromium. The Langmuir model is not able to fit the experimental values for Cr, nevertheless is able to fit Cu, where the maximum adsorption was 13. 4 mg kg- 1.

40|$|Purpose: This study aims to (1) {{evaluate}} {{the environmental impacts}} associated with {{the three types of}} <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> produced in Portuguese cork oak woodlands (in Alentejo region) considering two alternative practices for stand establishment (plantation and natural regeneration), (2) compare the environmental impacts of <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> production in Portuguese cork oak woodlands and in Catalonian cork oak forests, and (3) assess the influence of different allocation criteria for partitioning the environmental impacts between the different types of <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> produced. : A cradle-to-gate approach was adopted starting with stand establishment up to cork storage in a field yard. The system boundaries include all management operations undertaken during the following stages: stand establishment, stand tending, cork stripping, and field recovery. The allocation of the environmental impacts to reproduction, second, and virgin cork was based on mass and market price criteria. An alternative allocation approach was simulated by allocating environmental impacts also to the wood produced in the cork oak stands. The impact assessment was performed using the characterization factors recommended by the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD). and discussion: In Portugal, cork produced from naturally regenerated stands has a better environmental performance than cork produced from planted stands, but the differences are smaller than 10...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{chemical}} components of cork in the sorption of several pesticides has been investigated. For this purpose <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> and three cork extracted fractions (i. e. cork free of aliphatic extractives, cork free of all extractives and cork free of all extractives and suberin) {{were used as}} sorbent of three ionic pesticides (propazine, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2, 4 -D) and alachlor) and five non-ionic pesticides (chlor-pyrifos, isoproturon, metamitron, methomyl and oxamyl) with a logK(ow) within the range - 0. 47 to 4. 92. The effect of cations on the ionic pesticides, propazine and 2, 4 -D sorption was also analyzed. Results indicated that the highest yields were obtained for chlorpyrifos and alachlor sorption onto <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> (> 55 %). After removal of aliphatic extractives sorption of all pesticides increased that ranged from 3 % for propazine to 31 % for alachlor. In contrast, removal of phenolic extractives caused a sorption decrease. Low sorption yields were obtained for hydrophobic pesticides such as metamitron, oxamyl and methomyl (< 11 %) by using all cork fractions and extremely low when using <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> (< 1 %). FTIR analysis was useful to indicate that lignin moieties were the main components involved on the sorption process. Modelling calculations evidenced that pi-stacking interactions with the aromatic groups of lignin {{play a major role}} in determining the adsorption properties of cork toward aromatic pesticides. Results presented in this paper gain insights into the cork affinities for pesticides and the interactions involved in the sorption process and also enables to envisage sorption affinity of cork for other organic pollutantsThis research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation as part of the projects CTM 2010 - 15185 and CTM 2012 - 37215 -C 02 - 0...|$|E
40|$|El títol de la versió pre-print de l'article és World trade {{analysis}} of cork {{products in the}} Iberian Peninsula: an economic characterization of a forestry industryCork oak forest grows endemically in the coastal regions of the western Mediterranean basin, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. The cork agro-forestry systems {{play a key role}} in ecological processes, and the outer bark, or cork, can be extracted sustainability without damaging the tree or affecting biodiversity. Because of the properties of the cork, an important forestry and industrial structure has been developed around its most valuable goods. This paper describes the current global trade patterns in the Iberian Peninsula, where Portugal and Spain are world leaders. Although these countries bring most of their cork trade flows together with the rest of the world, there are clear differences between these sectors. The aim of this study was to identify these differences and to characterize each analysed sector from an economic perspective. The primary difference between the sectors lies in the characteristics of their supply chain and their capacity to generate wealth from <b>raw</b> <b>cork.</b> Portugal primarily produces and processes <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> into products with high added value. Spain bases its cork sector on raw material and half-manufactured cork, and it is not able to use the full potential that cork provides. Catalonia is an exception because it is the global leader in the champagne stopper market. To encourage the development of the entire cork sector, every link in the supply chain should be strengthened through the establishment of companies and the generation of employment, and therefore the development of rural areas. Moreover, this industry must establish its own development strategies for the future, thereby increasing its investment in R&D and innovation in relation to the opportunities identified as follows: the potential for diversification beyond the wine market, the improvement potential for forest management and the enhancement of sustainability and eco-efficiency in every link of the cork supply chain...|$|E

30|$|Epoxy resins {{are one of}} the {{structural}} adhesives with greater applicability, mainly due to their versatility and mechanical, thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxies present great strength and modulus of elasticity, low creep and good thermal resistance [1]. However, due to the high crosslinking, the polymeric structure presents low toughness and a low resistance to crack initiation and propagation [4, 5]. There are some solutions available to improve ductility of brittle adhesives, like the inclusion of particles (inorganic or organic) [6, 7]. Natural <b>raw</b> materials, such <b>cork,</b> can be used to improve ductility in brittle adhesives and currently different industries are encouraged to include these materials, with the aim to reduce the carbon footprint. Cork is an organic material with unique properties, obtained by a truly sustainable process, since it is renewable and biodegradable [8]. Cork is characterized by being lightweight, flexible, and substantially impermeable to liquids and gases, with excellent thermal, acoustic and vibration insulation, being also an innocuous and rootless material [9 – 11].|$|R
40|$|Two methods {{based on}} {{headspace}} solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography– ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-IT/MS) were {{proposed for the}} analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in cork material used in the production of cork stoppers. The effect of various factors affecting the extraction efficiency was carried out by means of a 24 full factorial design. The first method allowed the extraction of 17 terpenes by using a divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber (50 / 30 μm). The optimal conditions were achieved when cork extract (5 mL) added with 2. 3 g of NaCl was extracted during 35 min at 55 °C. The second method allowed the identification of 41 carbonyl compounds after in-solution (5 mL) derivatization with O-(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine hydrochloride (PFBHA, 2. 3 mg/mL), followed by an incubation period of 6 min at 52 °C and extraction during 36 min at the same temperature, using a PDMS/DVB (50 / 30 μm) fiber. Both methods are simple, solvent free and fast. These methods were applied to the analysis of different <b>cork</b> <b>raw</b> material showing significant differences in the amounts of volatile compounds analyzed. Alcanfor and α-terpineol were the terpenes compounds present at highest amounts, and within carbonyl compounds analyzed, some samples presented a high level of butanal, octanal, nonanal, and glyoxal. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

By using these values, selected after different tests of coherence and credibility, Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher’s indexes and a “synthetic cork deflator” are calculated. Then, a preliminary analysis about the unitary values as a proxy to the prices {{during the second half}} of twentieth century is realized.

40|$|International audienceThe cosorption of gaseous {{sulfur dioxide}} (SO 2) and water vapor (H 2 O) on <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> powder by using {{calorimetry}} coupled with manometry at 298 K was studied. Sorption isotherms of single components confirm the previous results obtained by thermogravimetry: SO 2 is well chemisorbed on cork surface while H 2 O is only physisorbed. Moreover, {{the interaction of}} SO 2 and H 2 O with cork appears more like an absorption process than an adsorption process. Competitive sorption of SO 2 and H 2 O first occurs in favor of SO 2 chemisorption. After all chemisorption sites are saturated by SO 2, the cosorption process becomes selective for H 2 O. The amount of SO 2 sorbed on cork is rather low compared to H 2 O. Results indicate that the sorption of SO 2 on cork cannot explain the decrease in SO 2 content observed during wine aging in bottle...|$|E

Its diversity was studied using both dependent (isolation) and independent culture methods (denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis and cloning of the ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 region). The mycobiota in the samples taken in the stages before and after the first boiling seems to be distinct from the population in the subsequent manufacturing stages. Most isolated fungi belong to the genera Penicillium, Eurotium and Cladosporium. The presence of uncultivable fungi, Ascomycota and endophytes in <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> was confirmed by sequencing. The samples taken after the first boiling contained uncultivable fungi, but in a few samples some isolated fungi were also detected. The main taxa present in the following stages were Chrysonilia sitophila, Penicillium glabrum and Penicillium spp. All applied techniques had complementary outcomes. The main factors driving the shift in cork fungal colonization seem to be the high levels of humidity and temperature to which the slabs are subjected during the boiling process.

40|$|Congreso celebrado del 30 de septiembre- 2 de octubre 2013, en Baeza (Jaén), España. The genus Quercus {{has about}} 500 species {{distributed}} throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Oak forests and woodlands are very abundant in the Mediterranean region and are vital providing a variety of ecosystem services. They provide with <b>raw</b> materials like <b>cork,</b> wood and fuel, and fodder for wild and domestic animals. The silvopastoral system known as “dehesa” provides habitats for wild animals and contributes to a higher biodiversity at the landscape scale. Oak trees provide a climate regulating service by their capacity to sequester carbon and therefore to mitigate the effects of climatic change. There is an increasing demand for cultural services provided by oak woodlands, mainly for recreation, ecotourism, and to enjoy their aesthetic and spiritual values. However, Global Change is affecting negatively oak forests and therefore diminishing their ecosystem services and in consequence human wellbeing. Main drivers are: land use change, introduction of exotic pathogens, air and soil pollution deteriorating oak health, and climatic change, in particular the reduction of rainfall. The aims of the workshop are to analyse the vulnerability and resilience of Quercus species coping with Global Change; to review the main ecological processes related with the regeneration of oaks and how they influence the recruitment and persistence of oak forests; to discuss the different management options for coping with the decline of oak forests and to assure their sustainability, showing case studies from Spain, Portugal and Mexico.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{encountered}} problems in wine industry is the oxidation of white wine during wine storage in bottle. The key factor involved in this phenomenon is the oxygen transfer. However the oxygen transfer through stopper during wine storage is not well studied. In the field of wine industry, the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) is commonly used {{as a mean to}} evaluate the stopper barrier efficiency [1]. It is now often indicated by some suppliers on technical data sheet. However, this parameter only represents a mass flow, which does not include the thickness of the material and the pressure gradient. Consequently, in literature, no diffusion and permeability values are given for materials used as stopper. Cork stoppers are the most used for wine ageing in bottle. Thus, it is important to better know its kinetics properties, in particular considering oxygen. In this work a manometric method was developed, based on the study of Rabiot and al, 1999 [2]. It aims at measuring the intrinsic oxygen diffusion coefficient of <b>raw</b> <b>cork.</b> This set up consists in two gas compartments separated by the cork disc stuck into a sealed metal ring.

40|$|Differences of <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> quality, {{in terms}} of {{thickness}} and porosity, were observed in productive cork oak (Quercus suber L.) stands in the Nebrodi and Iblei mountains of Sicily in relation to stand density. Five study areas were chosen {{across a range of}} different stand density satisfying specific sampling requirements among two managed cork oak stands. Analysis of variance using Fisher-Snedecor's F test (p< 0, 05) were used to identify statistically significant differences of cork quality and sylvicultural, dendrometric and cork stripping parameters between study areas within each stand and also between stands. Relationships between cork quality and sylvicultural and dendrometric parameters were also tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r). The results shown that sylvicultural practices are a key factor influencing cork quality: statistically significant differences in cork thickness and crown area were observed between areas at different stand density; positive correlations were found between cork thickness and crown area in lower density study areas favouring a significant vegetative activity; negative correlations were found between the parameters of cork stripping (cork stripping coefficient, cork stripping surface, maximum height of cork stripping) and cork thickness. No correlations were found between cork porosity and dendrometric or sylvicultural parameters, demonstrating the probable genetic origin of cork porosity...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} know the {{environmental}} behaviour of toxic pollutants it is fundamental to understand the role of chemical components of a material on sorption of such pollutants. In this study, the sorption of a mix of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by cork fractions (i. e. <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> (CF), free extractive cork (FEF) and nonsaponifiable (DESF)) has been investigated {{to better understand the}} role of biopolymers and extractable fraction of cork on their sorption behaviour. All samples were analyzed through elemental analysis and were examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Alter removing the extractable fraction and the suberin from the cork, the sorption capacities (K-oc) of FEF and DESF exhibited mean reductions of 70 % and 30 % respectively. In addition, the sorption results of three pairs of cork samples with different chemical content confirm that the extractable fraction serves as the major sorption medium for PAHs. Considering only low molecular weight PAHs positive correlations between K-oc with K-ow (R- 2 = 0. 70) and F number (R- 2 = 0. 65) were found, showing that these parameters are involved in this adsorption processThis research was funded by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion as part of the project CTM 2010 - 1518...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to analyze the measures implemented during the Franco dictatorship over the period 1939 ㈀ 1959 to revive the exports of cork products, which had fallen sharply {{since the beginning of}} the crisis of 1929. The first measure, implemented in 1939 and 1940, was granting tax reliefs to exporters of several cork products; its impact on commercial traffic of cork was very low. The second measure was the establishment, between 1946 and 1950, of a subsidies system for cork exports, which allowed the recovery of the Spanish cork exports. Yet, these were classified as dumping by the United States and created a trade conflict, which forced its repeal. Immediately after this repeal, cork products were incorporated into the multiple exchange rates mechanism in force in Spain since 1948, a system of hidden subsidies that allowed an improvement in cork exports during the 1950 's. The work also examines whether the objective of protecting domestic industry, through the promotion of cork manufactures exports, was limited by the need of obtaining foreign exchange from exports. The incentives that the dictatorship applied for the export of <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> that was in turn needed by the industry to work with, seems to point to such limit.

40|$|Cork {{is known}} as the {{material}} used for the production of wine stoppers. The specific properties of cork, e. g. low density, very low permeability to water, elastic properties and inertness have made it the best sealant for quality wine. Here we studied the relation between compression, tensile and bending stress in cork and the influence of structural characteristics of cork on its mechanical behaviour. The material was sampled from <b>raw</b> <b>cork</b> planks of good quality (class 1) and poor quality (class 4) collected at one industrial mill after post-harvest six-month air stabilization, water boiling and air drying as usually applied in cork industrial processing. The samples had densities ranging 0. 123 - 0. 203 g. cm- 3 and porosities between 0. 5 and 22. 0 %. There are differences between the type of stress and the corresponding direction of stress. For the same direction of stress, the Young modulus in tension is higher then in bending and it is lowest in compression. The bending Young modulii were well correlated with the tensile Young modulii, because while in bending the sample is submitted to both tensile and compression stresses, the fracture occurs in the tensile zone. There {{were no significant differences in}} the mechanical properties of cork samples obtained from cork planks of different quality classes but the density is an important factor and samples with higher density showed overall larger resistance. Mechanical properties were influenced by the structural features related to the lenticular channels, namely the presence of thick walled and lignified cells that may border the lenticular channels...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work reports {{measurements}} of effective oxygen diffusion coefficient in <b>raw</b> <b>cork.</b> Kinetics of oxygen transfer through cork is studied at 298 K {{thanks to a}} homemade manometric device composed of two gas compartments separated by a cork wafer sample. The first compartment contains oxygen, whereas the second one is kept under dynamic vacuum. The pressure decrease in the first compartment is recorded {{as a function of}} time. The effective diffusion coefficient D-eff is obtained by applying Fick's law to transient state using a numerical method based on finite differences. An analytical model derived from Fick's law applied to steady state is also proposed. Results given by these two methods are in close agreement with each other. The harmonic average of the effective diffusion coefficients obtained from the distribution of 15 cork wafers of 3 mm thickness is 1. 1 X 10 (- 9) m(2) s(- 1) with a large distribution over four decades. The statistical analysis of the Gaussian distribution obtained on a 3 mm cork wafer is extrapolated to a 48 mm cork wafer, which length corresponds to a full cork stopper. In this case, the probability density distribution gives a mean value of D-eff equal to 1. 6 x 10 (- 9) m(2) s(- 1). This result shows {{that it is possible to}} obtain the effective diffusion coefficient of oxygen through cork from short time (few days) measurements performed on a thin cork wafer, whereas months are required to obtain the diffusion coefficient for a full cork stopper. Permeability and oxygen transfer rate are also calculated for comparison with data from other studies...|$|E
