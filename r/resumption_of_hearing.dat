50|$|On <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hearing</b> on 10 March William Shore - Manager of the No1 Kaitangata Mine {{took the}} stand. Shore had found Archie Jarvis' {{body in the}} old workings. He was also certain that the {{explosion}} had been caused in these workings. George Jonathan Binns, a qualified mining engineer and viewer of coal for the New Zealand Government took the stand next. He had inspected the old workings and considered {{that they had the}} potential to be dangerous. He had informed Hodge. Hodge had told him on 24 January that no gas was present in the mine. If gas was present in the mine then the old working should have been sealed off. The alternative and what had happened was gross negligence on behalf of the Mine Manager. Binns did not have the authority to require the Mine Manager to take any action. He did report the situation to his superiors and had, after the explosion, found that the gas had again built up to dangerous levels in the old workings. Binns was later recalled and asked if the gas in the old workings could have come from the new ones. He advised that this was not likely and that it was from the old workings.|$|R
5000|$|Although Life B-P Church {{sued for}} only SGD250,000, {{restricted}} by the jurisdictional limit {{based on the}} venue or court where the action was commenced, it wanted much more than this sum. However, after a 2-day open court trial on 24-25 July 2014 {{when it became clear}} that FEBC would be able to successfully make a “no case to answer” submission (upon <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> the court <b>hearing),</b> Life B-P Church requested FEBC to make an offer for settlement which FEBC acceded to despite taking the view that Life B-P Church’s claim was devoid of any legal basis and having had earlier offers of love-gifts made with the condition that no further claim would be made (until implementation of the Scheme on the sharing and maintenance of the premises) refused by Life B-P Church. FEBC responded with an offer of SGD300,000 on 8 August 2014 - lower than SGD350,000 offered on 5 November 2013 (because of further legal costs incurred)—and this was accepted on 14 August 2014 despite Life B-P Church threatening on 8 August 2014 to transfer the suit to the High Court to sue for a higher sum of SGD615,000.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the association between}} breast feeding after <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menstruation and the duration from <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menses to the next conception. Data from a survey, “Breast-Feeding and Its Effect on Fertility,” conducted in 1987 {{under the auspices of}} the Centre of Population Studies, Banaras Hindu University, India, were used. We used hazard models of conception rates after the return of menstruation with breast-feeding duration as a time-dependent covariate. The interaction of breast-feeding duration after <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menses and postpartum amenorrhea have a significant effect on the rate of conception after return <b>of</b> menses. After <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menstruation, when there is no breast feeding, the risk of conception increases with the increase in postpartum amenorrhea. However, breast feeding attenuates the effects of postpartum amenorrhea. These results suggest that breast feeding beyond the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> menstruation plays a significant role in the proximate determinants to reduce fertility...|$|R
