50|$|After VHF Channel 1 was re-allocated to land-mobile radio {{systems in}} 1948 due to <b>radio-interference</b> problems, one dozen TV {{channels}} remained. That amount {{was found to}} be insufficient during the latter 1940s and 1950s. For example, the following cities were never allocated any VHF-TV stations at all, due to technical reasons found by the FCC: Huntsville, Alabama; Fort Wayne, Indiana; South Bend, Indiana, Lexington, Kentucky; Springfield, Massachusetts; Youngstown, Ohio; Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; and Yakima, Washington. In addition, more cities were able to receive only one VHF broadcast station. Also, the entire state of New Jersey would receive only one VHF broadcast station of its own (which was to ultimately become WNET 13 Newark), leaving much of the state to be served from New York City or Philadelphia. Delaware also had only one VHF station. There were problems with an insufficient number of TV channels being available to cover all of the United States.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{with the}} {{miniaturization}} of communication devices, dense and highly mobile ad-hoc networks are very common. Besides, {{more and more}} devices have several radio interfaces. In such an environment, multi-path routing should be considered. Yet, only few multi-path ad-hoc routing protocols {{take into account the}} <b>radio-interferences</b> which might arise between two geographically close routes. Moreover, they generally only forbid the addition of interfering paths rather than looking for a different, more optimized, solution. This paper presents NICE-MRP, a novel multi-path routing protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks giving efficient solutions with respect to physical <b>radio-interferences</b> between paths. This protocol discovers and stores several combinations of non-interfering multi-path routes. The best multi-path route is used to transmit data, whereas alternative multi-path routes are kept to dynamically react to route breakages due to mobility and node failures. Compared to other well-known protocols, NICE-MRP presents good qualities in terms of latency, overhead and packet losses. Besides, these results end to be rather independent from the degree of mobility...|$|R

We have {{analyzed}} {{the results of}} the Gaussian decomposition of the Leiden/Dwingeloo Survey (LDS) of galactic neutral hydrogen for the pres-ence of Gaussians probably not directly related to galactic H i emission. It is demonstrated that at least three classes of such components can be distin-guished. The narrowest Gaussians, obtained during the decomposition, mostly represent stronger random noise peaks in profiles and some still uncorrected <b>radio-interferences.</b> Many of slightly wider weak Gaussians are caused by in-creased uncertainties near the profile edges and with the still increasing width the baseline problems become dominating among weak components.

40|$|Abstract Distributed video {{applications}} are an emerging area of our modern information society. They are frequently integrated into multimedia-applications and process video data streams produced by video encoders. This processing imposes high storage and throughput requirements {{as well as}} temporal constrains due to the real-time aspect on communication systems. For instance real-time video communication like video conferencing does not perform very favourable when run over best-effort networks without quality-of-service management. Because of data losses or high delays as consequences of congestions, bottlenecks or <b>radio-interference</b> in WLANs the service offered by such a video application can deteriorate. To support the solution of such problems this paper presents {{a study of the}} output process of video encoders to quantify and characterize the requirements of video applications on networks. In particular we measure and investigate the stochastic traffic characteristics of H. 264 /AVC-encoded video streams as network load. This can support the solution of the problem to dimension, configure or parameterize video applications or required services of underlying communication systems. We used the presented results especially to derive and calibrate our analytical and simulation models and tools for load generation as well as reliability and performance evaluation of real-time video communication. Key words: multimedia system, quality of service, real-time video encoding, video stream, frame length, compression, traffic characterization, network load, H. 264, video communicatio...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the Gaussian decomposition of the Leiden/Dwingeloo Survey (LDS) of galactic neutral hydrogen {{for the presence}} of Gaussians probably not directly related to galactic HI emission. It is demonstrated that at least three classes of such components can be distinguished. The narrowest Gaussians mostly represent stronger random noise peaks in profiles and some still uncorrected <b>radio-interferences.</b> Many of slightly wider weak Gaussians are caused by increased uncertainties near the profile edges and with the still increasing width the baseline problems become dominating among weak components. Statistical criteria are given for separation of the parameter space regions, most likely populated with the problematic components from those where the Gaussians are with higher probability describing the actual Milky Way HI emission. The same analysis is applied to the Leiden/Argentina/Bonn survey (LAB). It is demonstrated that the selection criteria for dividing the parameter space are to a great extent independent of the particular survey in use. The presence of the baseline problems in the LDS is indicated by the peculiarities of the distribution of the widest Gaussians in the sky. A similar plot for {{the northern part of the}} LAB demonstrates considerably lower numbers of spurious components, but there are still problems with the southern part of the LAB. The strange characteristics of the observational noise in the southern part of the LAB are pointed out. Comment: 22 pages, 14 figures. Accepted for publication in Baltic Astronomy.

40|$|The redshifted 21 cm line {{of neutral}} {{hydrogen}} (HI), potentially observable at low radio frequencies (~ 50 - 200 MHz), {{should be a}} powerful probe of the physical conditions of the inter-galactic medium during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). The sky-averaged HI signal {{is expected to be}} extremely weak (~ 100 mK) in comparison to the foreground of up to 10000 K at the lowest frequencies of interest. The detection of such a weak signal requires an extremely stable, well characterised system and a good understanding of the foregrounds. Development of a nearly perfectly (~mK accuracy) calibrated total power radiometer system is essential for this type of experiment. We present the BIGHORNS (Broadband Instrument for Global HydrOgen ReioNisation Signal) experiment which was designed and built to detect the sky-averaged HI signal from the EoR at low radio frequencies. The BIGHORNS system is a mobile total power radiometer, which can be deployed in any remote location in order to collect <b>radio-interference</b> (RFI) free data. The system was deployed in remote, radio quiet locations in Western Australia and low RFI sky data have been collected. We present a description of the system, its characteristics, details of data analysis and calibration. We have identified multiple challenges to achieving the required measurement precision, which triggered two major improvements for the future system. Comment: 20 pages, 27 figures.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the next {{generation}} of electric grids, called smart grids, the use of modern and advanced communication systems in high-voltage substations can significantly improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of the electric power grid. Indeed, the deployment of intelligent sensor networks allows {{for the development of a}} more efficient, rapid, and automated remote monitoring, control and diagnosis in major pieces of high-voltage equipment in substations: current, potential, and power transformers, circuit breakers, and high-voltage disconnectors. Wireless sensor networks offer significant benefits in this area. Unfortunately, high-voltage substations are harsh and hostile environments whose wireless communication systems can be interfered to such an extent as to render their performances severely degraded. This work consists of the identification, characterization, and modelling of electromagnetic interférences in substations for the deployment of wireless sensor networks. In the first part, we propose a radio frequency measurement setup for electromagnetic interférences identification and characterization in the frequency range of 800 MHz to 5 GHz in substations. The majority of interference sources comes from radiations caused by partial discharges. The induced signals are characterized by strong transient impulses whose such events follow a cyclostationary process. Next, a characterization process is proposed, by which physical characteristics of partial discharge can be measured in terms of first- and second-order statistics. In the second part, we investigate the modelling of electromagnetic interferences caused by partial discharge sources. First, we propose complete and coherent approach model that links physical characteristics of high-voltage installations to the induced <b>radio-interference</b> spectra of partial discharge sources. The goodness-of-fit of the proposed physical model has been measured based on some interesting statistical metrics. This allows us to assess the effectiveness of our approach in terms of first- and second-order statistics. Finally, a generalized radio-noise model for substations is proposed, in which there are many discharges sources that are randomly distributed over space and time according to the Poisson field of interferers approach. This allows for the identification of some interesting statistical properties of moments, cumulants and probability distributions. These can, in turn, be utilized in signal processing algorithms for rapid partial discharge’s identification, localization, and impulsive noise mitigation techniques in wireless communications in substations...|$|E
