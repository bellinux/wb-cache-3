Each region has an elected region chief, a volunteer adult who is appointed as the region chairman to oversee its region Committee, and an appointed professional (staff) adviser. Each region chief is elected at the national planning meeting the day after the election of the national chief and vice chief by a caucus of the section chiefs from the given region.

Grit is associated with differences in potential motivation, one pathway in motivational intensity theory. Grit may also influence an individual’s perception of task difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} rankings can divert universities’ {{attention}} away from teaching and social responsibility towards the type of scientific research valued by indicators used for ranking exercises. There have also been concerns that by applying a limited set of criteria to world universities, and given the strong desire to feature in the top 200 universities, rankings actually encourage the homogenization of higher education institutions, making them less responsive and less <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> immediate contexts. The fact that rankings are also said to favour the advantage enjoyed by the 200 best-ranked institutions {{has important implications for}} equity.|$|E

The close relation of economic theory and practice with politics is a focus of contention that may shade or distort the most unpretentious original tenets of economics, and is often confused with specific social agendas and value systems.|$|E

5000|$|McMurray {{states that}} health {{literacy}} {{is important in}} a community because it addresses health inequities. It {{is no coincidence that}} individuals with lower levels of health literacy live, disproportionally, in communities with lower socio-economic standing. A barrier to achieving adequate health literacy for these individuals is a lack of awareness, or understanding of, information and resources <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> improving <b>their</b> health. This knowledge gap arises from both patients being unable to understand information presented to them and hospitals' inadequate efforts and materials to address these literacy gaps.|$|R
