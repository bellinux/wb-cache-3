5000|$|Model's {{output is}} also used in {{structuring}} of a project finance deal. Most importantly, {{it is used to}} determine the maximum amount of debt the project company can have and debt <b>repayment</b> <b>profile,</b> so that in any year the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) should not exceed a predetermined level. DSCR {{is also used}} as a measure of riskiness of the project and, therefore, as a determinant of interest rate on debt. Minimal DSCR set for a project depends on riskiness of the project, i.e. on predictability and stability of cash flow generated by it. As a rule of thumb, DSCR should not be less than 1.60. However, in some cases (such as power plant projects with strong off-take agreements) it could be set at as low as 1.05.|$|E
40|$|In Europe (and elsewhere) governments {{intervene}} to stimulate {{innovation in the}} SME sector, and because SMEs face financial constraints in particular, governments encourage the provision of debt and equity (venture capital) finance to such firms. This paper discusses sales contingent claim (SCC backed finance - funding secured only on a claim written on sales - that offers a different <b>repayment</b> <b>profile</b> to debt and equity. The attractiveness of such finance to firms {{as well as the}} behaviour of firms financed in this way are analysed. For various reasons SCC-backed financial instruments are generally not available to SMEs on the market, but it is argued that wider availability could further stimulate the growth and innovative activity of SMEs. The correction of this market incompleteness by the introduction of government schemes providing SCC-backed corporate finance for SMEs in higher risk (higher tech) sectors is recommended. The workability of such a scheme is explored by looking at existing examples aimed largely at project finance for larger firms. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses quantitatively {{the costs}} of sovereign default for the economy, in a model where banks with long positions in government debt {{play a central role}} in the financial intermediation for private sector's investments and face financial frictions that limit their leverage ability. Calibration tries to resemble some features of the Eurozone, where discussions about bailout schemes and default risk have been central issues. Results show that the model captures one important cost of default pointed out by empirical and theoretical literature on debt crises, namely the fall in investment that follows haircut episodes, what can be explained by a worsening in banks' balance sheet conditions that limits credit for the private sector and raises their funding costs. The cost in terms of output decrease is though not significant enough to justify the existence of debt markets and the government incentives for debt repayment. Assuming that the government is able to alleviate its constrained budget by imposing a restructuring on debt <b>repayment</b> <b>profile</b> that allows it to cut taxes, our model generates an important difference for output path comparing lump-sum taxes and distortionary. For our calibration, quantitative results show that in terms of output and utility, it is possible that the effect on the labour supply response generated by tax cuts dominates investment drop caused by credit crunch on financial markets. We however abstract from default costs associated to the breaking of existing contracts, external sanctions and risk spillovers between countries, that might also be relevant in addition to financial disruption effects. Besides, there exist considerable trade-offs for short and long run path of economic variables related to government and banks' behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{provision}} of public services and infrastructure {{has evolved over}} the years and currently, the ever-increasing demand for public services and the greater levels of required renewal and repair of infrastructure have created unsustainable strains on limited public sector resources, leading to a resurgence of private sector involvement in such projects, to a much larger degree than ever before. The key to the success of such privately financed projects is the structure of the financing package. This thesis traces the evolution of project financing, exploring the financial engineering of funding packages using debt and equity instruments by way of financial modelling. This research derives a generic health sector project for which a fmancial model is subsequently developed, based on actual project finance modelling practice and incorporating various financial instruments for funding and credit enhancement. Using this financial model, different permutations of financial structure are simulated and investigated; the use of bank loans versus fixed and index-linked bond issues, debt <b>repayment</b> <b>profiles</b> and blended equity structures, are some of the areas examined, as are gearing, credit enhancement, and the sensitivity of different financial structures to inflation. This thesis offers insightful knowledge on the process of financial engineering for project finance, and on the various instruments and mechanisms that can be employed for project profitability and financial robustness. The development and manipulation of a detailed financial model highlight the role and importance of optimisation of the financial package during modelling and overall, afford the reader {{a better understanding of the}} dynamic that exists between the components of a project's financial structure.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} graduate {{labor market}} performance {{and its implications}} {{in the design of}} a student loan scheme for higher education in Malaysia. The current mortgage-type loan scheme under the National Higher Education Fund Corporation (NHEFC) creates a major problem in terms of loan defaults which contribute to high implicit subsidies and concerns related to the sustainability of this scheme. With high unemployment among fresh graduates and where over-education is found to be prominent among employed graduates, {{it is likely that the}} current mortgage-type loan scheme creates a heavy burden on many graduates with relatively low incomes. The important concept relates to what is known as the ‘repayment burden’, the proportion of a debtor’s income that is required to meet repayment obligations. To understand the extent of <b>repayment</b> burdens, age-earnings <b>profiles</b> are estimated for Malaysia and it is found that the earning ability of graduates varies by level and field of study. The current mortgage-type student loans are shown to impose quite high repayment burdens, particularly for graduates in arts and social sciences, with the results helping us to understand the extent of loan defaults. Adjusting the data to include unemployed graduates, which results in a more informed repayment burden calculation, adds very considerably to our assessment of the average repayment difficulties. In assessing the efficacy of the current loan scheme, we compare the implicit subsidies under the current mortgage-type student loans with a proposed (hypothetical) income contingent loan (ICL) ...|$|R
