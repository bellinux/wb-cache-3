5|$|The English {{judicial}} system had altered considerably {{over the previous}} century, with the royal judges playing {{a larger role in}} delivering justice across the country. John had used his royal discretion to extort large sums of money from the barons, effectively taking payment to offer justice in particular cases, {{and the role of the}} Crown in delivering justice had become politically sensitive among the barons. Clauses 39 and 40 demanded due process be applied in the royal justice system, while clause 45 required that the King appoint knowledgeable royal officials to the <b>relevant</b> <b>roles.</b> Although these clauses did not have any special significance in the original charter, this part of Magna Carta became singled out as particularly important in later centuries. In the United States, for example, the Supreme Court of California interpreted clause 45 in 1974 as establishing a requirement in common law that a defendant faced with the potential of incarceration be entitled to a trial overseen by a legally trained judge.|$|E

50|$|Veterinary {{medicine}} is widely practiced, both {{with and without}} professional supervision. Professional care is most often led by a veterinary physician (also known as a vet, veterinary surgeon or veterinarian), but also by paraveterinary workers such as veterinary nurses or technicians. This can be augmented by other paraprofessionals with specific specialisms such as animal physiotherapy or dentistry, and species <b>relevant</b> <b>roles</b> such as farriers.|$|E

50|$|LIM domains were {{initially}} identified in three homeodomain transcription factors (lin11, is11, and mec3). In {{addition to this}} homeodomain proteins and other proteins involved in development, LIM domains have also been identified in non-homeodomain proteins with <b>relevant</b> <b>roles</b> in cellular differentiation, association with cytoskeleton and senescence. These domains contain a tandem cysteine-rich Zn2+-finger motif and embrace the consensus sequence CX2CX16-23HX2CX2CX2CX16-21CX2C/H/D. LIM domains bind to PDZ domains, bHLH transcription factors, and other LIM domains.|$|E
5000|$|Another foreshadowed {{element of}} {{cognitive}} ecological theory comes from ecological anthropologist Gregory Bateson, who considered {{the notion of}} informational feedback loops between mind and environment, particularly their role in generating meaning and awareness of one's surroundings. In an essay, he speculates on how an observer might best delineate the [...] "self" [...] of a blind man. In his treatment, he questions whether one may arbitrarily choose to carve out the man's informational processing loop at his brain or his hands or his walking stick without offering an incomplete view of his cognitive process. This discussion of concept remains influential in modern cognitive ecological considerations of the densely interconnected elements of ecology that play <b>relevant</b> <b>roles</b> in cognition.|$|E
50|$|During his {{lifetime}} Bishop Obot nurtured priestly and religious vocations by his preachings and teachings, especially his lifestyle of commitment and {{dedication to the}} faith and the church. He was very resilient and energetic, he ensured the training of his priests in different areas of academic interests sending them to train in Canada, Rome, Italy; and the United States, and also within Nigeria. He built many convents for religious women and men, and helped to integrate their apostolates within the diocese; visualizing them as possessing <b>relevant</b> <b>roles</b> and forming {{a crucial part of}} the church's identity. This thinking was rooted in his understanding and evolving profound ecclesiology that perceived the church as the family of God's people, where each and everyone has a critical role to play in promoting and shaping its multivalent features.|$|E

50|$|After {{completing}} his bachelor's degree in Arts from RBC College, Naihati, Chakraborty {{began his career}} as an actor in Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal. He had been an active theater person from his school days. After a fight with his parents, he left home to settle in Kolkata and chase his acting dreams. When he found himself unable to get <b>relevant</b> <b>roles,</b> he changed his plans and decided to become a Director. He was recruited as an Assistant Director by Director Arindam Dey (popularly known as Mamdo Da) in 2000. After six years of association, rigorous hard work, immense dedication, Raj directed his first telefilm, titled 'Nawder Chaand'. This was successful, and he followed it with a series of almost 17 telefilms, talk shows, non-fiction reality shows which gave large viewerships to the channels. Raj is the key member for historical regional TV series like 'Mirakkel' and 'Dance Bangla Dance'. Raj has contributed to the changing face of the regional television of Bengal.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} in Cairo of Italian parents. Returned to his {{homeland}} while still boy and completed his studies in Milan at the Bocconi University, Faculty of Business Administration and Economics. While a student he was deeply influenced by the guide of Gaetano Mosca and Gino Zappa, but only the latter actually became his mentor in the academic and research career in the early thirties. In the early fifties he met and developed friendship and cooperation with Costantino Bresciani Turroni and Amintore Fanfani. He had also relations of fiendly competitive collaboration with Raffaele Mattioli, chairman of Banca Commerciale Italiana, and Enrico Cuccia, chairman of Mediobanca. In these years he became distinguished Professor of Banking at his Alma Mater, where, later, served also as rector. Among his students may be mentioned several prominent Italian bankers and economists as Mario Monti, Mario Arcelli, Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, Fiorella Kostoris, Giovanni Arrighi, Roberto Mazzotta and Fabrizio Saccomanni. A number of pupils shared his scientific views and became professors in leading Italian universities: among them Francesco Arcucci, Alberto Arienti, Alberto Bertoni, Tancredi Bianchi, Sergio Bortolani, Claudio Demattè, Arnaldo Mauri, Paolo Mottura, Marco Onado, Antonio Pin, Antonio Porteri, and Roberto Ruozi. In 1952 Dell'Amore was appointed Chairman {{of the board of}} directors of one of the main Italian banks, Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde and later also elected President of the Associazione fra le Casse di Risparmio Italiane as well as in 1969 President of the International Savings Banks Institute (ISBI) in Geneva, now World Savings Banks Institute in Bruxelles. As president of ISBI he met the British prime minister Edward Heath at the X World Savings Banks Congress held in London in 1972. Under the guide of Dell'Amore the Lombardy's Savings Bank was shaken out its traditional conservative mould to become transformed in the space of two decades into a dynamic modern financial institution. During that period, its deposits climbed 18 times in real terms while its branch network doubled and its employees tripled in number. In 1970 he met in Milan Haile Selassie and the Ethiopian Minister of Finance Mammo Tadesse to discuss programs on technical assistance to Ethiopia in the field of household savings mobilisation. In 1973 he established in Milan Finafrica Foundation with the aim to help the improvement of African financial systems by means of training, providing technical assistance and research. Dell'Amore had also <b>relevant</b> <b>roles</b> in politics: Governor of the Province of Milan, Senator of the Republic of Italy in 1963 and previously, in 1954, Minister of foreign trade in the government led by Amintore Fanfani. His funeral was celebrated in Milan by the cardinal Giovanni Colombo. In February 2006 a square in the centre of Milan (nearby la Scala Opera House) has been named after Giordano Dell'Amore.|$|E
