Spare parts demand forecasting and inventory planning, which {{is an important part}} of MRO activities, must be accurate to avoid costs because of surplus spare parts or machine downtimes. The restriction of reduced accessibility to wind turbines during the winter months also has to be taken into account when planning maintenance activities and spare part inventories for wind farms.

40|$|Structural {{airframe}} {{maintenance is}} {{a subset of}} aircraft maintenance, which is often performed at scheduled intervals to detect and repair cracks that would otherwise affect {{the safety of the}} aircraft. With the progress of structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques, which uses on-board sensors and actuators to assess damage status, condition-based maintenance (CBM) is considered as an alternative to traditional scheduled maintenance. By applying SHM techniques, CBM can access damages status as frequently as needed and unscheduled maintenance can be asked once the damage exceeds a particular threshold. Due to the harsh working environment and sensor limitation, the measurement data acquired from SHM is often quite noisy. In this paper, Extended Kalman filter is used to filer the noise to provide an accurate estimation of crack size and crack growth parameters together with their associated uncertainty. This knowledge is used to obtain a probabilistic estimate of the <b>remaining</b> <b>useful</b> service <b>life</b> of the structure.

50|$|Operational loads {{monitoring}} (OLM) {{is a term}} {{given to}} act of investigating {{the characteristics of a}} structure in its normal operating environment. This term is often used to describe programs involving aircraft to extending their in-service life in a manner that does not compromise flight safety. A typical program would involve the installation of strain gauges to measure loads, accelerometers to measure g-force and other parameters to support the program or to add value (such as flap position, aircraft altitude, environmental conditions etc.), data acquisition system to process this data and a recorder to save the data for later analysis. In this way it is very similar to structural health monitoring, a term that is sometimes also used to describe operational loads monitoring. Unlike Health and Usage Monitoring Systems, OLM programs are generally a short term project used to assess the <b>remaining</b> <b>useful</b> safe <b>life</b> of an airframe. This is especially important when an aircraft's role changes as the stresses and strains may now be significantly different from those initially anticipated. OLM program's benefits include a possible increased safe operating life figure and helping to prevent accidents such as the C-130 crash that occurred after the platform had been modified and flown for a different mission (fire fighting).There are several active OLM programs currently underway, including research initiatives to standardize approaches for civilian aircraft.|$|R

Until the electrification of the Waldshut-Koblenz gap in 1999, passenger services on the bridge were carried out by diesel multiple units of Deutsche Bahn.

50|$|Model-based prognostics {{attempts}} to incorporate physical understanding (physical models) {{of the system}} into the estimation of <b>remaining</b> <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> (RUL). Modeling physics can be accomplished at different levels, for example, micro and macro levels. At the micro level (also called material level), physical models are embodied by series of dynamic equations that define relationships, {{at a given time}} or load cycle, between damage (or degradation) of a system/component and environmental and operational conditions under which the system/component are operated. The micro-level models are often referred as damage propagation model. For example, Yu and Harris’s fatigue life model for ball bearings, which relates the fatigue life of a bearing to the induced stress, Paris and Erdogan's crack growth model, and stochastic defect-propagation model are other examples of micro-level models. Since measurements of critical damage properties (such as stress or strain of a mechanical component) are rarely available, sensed system parameters have to be used to infer the stress/strain values. Micro-level models need to account in the uncertainty management the assumptions and simplifications, which may pose significant limitations of that approach.|$|E

50|$|The {{motivation}} for pre-estimate aggregation {{may be that}} no ground truth data are available. This may occur in situations where diagnostics {{does a good job}} in detecting faults that are resolved (through maintenance) before system failure occurs. Therefore, there are hardly any run-to-failure data. However, there is incentive to know better when a system would fail to better leverage the <b>remaining</b> <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> {{while at the same time}} avoiding unscheduled maintenance (unscheduled maintenance is typically more costly than scheduled maintenance and results in system downtime). Garga et al. REF describe conceptually a pre-estimate aggregation hybrid approach where domain knowledge is used to change the structure of a neural network, thus resulting in a more parsimonius representation of the network. Another way to accomplish the pre-estimate aggregation is by a combined off-line process and on-line process: In the off-line mode, one can use a physics-based simulation model to understand the relationships of sensor response to fault state; In the on-line mode, one can use data to identify current damage state, then track the data to characterize damage propagation, and finally apply an individualized data-driven propagation model for remaining life prediction.|$|E
5000|$|Prognostics is an {{engineering}} discipline focused on predicting {{the time at}} which a system or a component [...] will no longer perform its intended function. This lack of performance is most often a failure beyond which the system {{can no longer be}} used to meet desired performance. The predicted time then becomes the <b>remaining</b> <b>useful</b> <b>life</b> (RUL), which is an important concept in decision making for contingency mitigation. Prognostics predicts the future performance of a component by assessing the extent of deviation or degradation of a system from its expected normal operating conditions. The science of prognostics is based on the analysis of failure modes, detection of early signs of wear and aging, and fault conditions. An effective prognostics solution is implemented when there is sound knowledge of the failure mechanisms that are likely to cause the degradations leading to eventual failures in the system. It is therefore necessary to have initial information on the possible failures (including the site, mode, cause and mechanism) in a product. Such knowledge is important to identify the system parameters that are to be monitored. Potential uses for prognostics is in condition-based maintenance. The discipline that links studies of failure mechanisms to system lifecycle management {{is often referred to as}} prognostics and health management (PHM), sometimes also system health management (SHM) or—in transportation applications—vehicle health management (VHM) or engine health management (EHM). Technical approaches to building models in prognostics can be categorized broadly into data-driven approaches, model-based approaches, and hybrid approaches.|$|E
