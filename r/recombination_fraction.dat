5000|$|Genetic linkage is the {{phenomenon}} where by alleles at different loci cosegregate in families. The strength of cosegregation {{is measured by}} the <b>recombination</b> <b>fraction</b> θ, the probability of an odd number of recombination. More complex pedigree provide higher power. Identity by descent (IBD) matrix estimation is a central component in mapping of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) using variance component models. Alleles have identity by type (IBT) when they have the same phenotypic effect. Alleles that are identical by type fall into two groups; those that are identical by descent (IBD) because they arose from the same allele in an earlier generation; and those that are non-identical by descent (NIBD) or identical by state (IBS) because they arose from separate mutations. Parent-offspring pairs share 50% of their genes IBD, and monozygotic twins share 100% IBD. It should be noted that what is relevant in linkage analysis is the inheritance (or coinheritance) of alleles at adjacent loci; therefore; it is critical importance to determine whether the alleles are identical by descent (i.e. copies from same parental alleles) or only identical by state (i.e. appearing same, but derived from two different copies of alleles). Therefore there three categories of family-based linkage analysis - strongly modeled (the traditional lod score model), weakly model based (variance components methods), or model free. Variance component methods may be viewed as hybrids.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Hunt Morgan's {{laboratory}} in 1911. Based on Morgan's {{observation that the}} <b>recombination</b> <b>fraction</b> between two loci increases with the distance between them, Alfred Sturtevant neglected his homework one evening and constructed the first genetic map covering six loci in Drosophila (Sturtevant, 1913). The statistical foundations of gene mapping were subsequently laid by Haldane, Hogben, Fisher, Penrose, Smith, and Morton (Morton, 1955). Genetic dissection of simple Mendalian and Mendalian-like traits has been greatly enhanced by numerous pioneering contribution of Newton E. Morton over the decades. The same methods are widely used today for investigating and sometime determining genetic basic of complex traits. The lod score method (Morton, 1955), which constitutes the basis of most of linkage studies, has been recognized as pivotal contribution.Unfortunately, linkage analysis in humans, animals and plants languished {{for more than a}} half century after Sturtevant's discovery {{because of the lack of}} genetic markers and of adequate computing power. By the early 1970s, computing resources were sufficiently widely distributed to stimulate algorithmic breakthroughs in likelihood evaluation on human pedigree data (Elston and Stewart, 1971; Lange and Elston, 1975; Ott, 1976; Cannings et al., 1978). Armed with Ott's computer program LIPED, geneticists were well poised to embark on human linkage studies. Initially the mapping work was limited to some of morphological markers and the speed was quite low. Mapping efforts are speeded by development of DNA markers that provided virtually unlimited supply of genetic markers - an idea first conceived by Botstein and colleagues for yeast crosses (Petes and Botstein, 1977) and subsequently for human families (Botstein et al., 1980). The idea of using markers to map in such families is to trace inheritance of existing human pedigrees as if one had set up crosses in the laboratory. After a decade of first discovery of molecular markers, the very first genome map in plants was reported in maize and tomato (Helentjaris et al., 1986) using RFLP marker in a F2 population. The familial linkage methods were very popular for qualitatively inherited molecular markers and traits of interest in humans, animals and plants. Later on the focus was turned to more complex traits - quantitatively inherited traits with high environmental influence. Such complex traits are affected by both environment and genes.|$|E
40|$|A maximum-likelihood {{method to}} {{estimate}} the <b>recombination</b> <b>fraction</b> and its sampling variance using informative and noninformative half-sib offspring is derived. Estimates of the <b>recombination</b> <b>fraction</b> are biased up to 20 cM when noninformative offspring are discarded. In certain scenarios, the sampling variance can be increased or reduced up to fivefold due to the bias in estimating the <b>recombination</b> <b>fraction</b> and the LOD score can be reduced up to 5 units when discarding noninformative offspring. Comparison of the estimates of <b>recombination</b> <b>fraction,</b> map distance, and LOD score when constructing a genetic map with 251 two-point linkage analyses and six families of Norwegian cattle was carried out to evaluate the implications of discarding noninformative offspring in practical situations. The average discrepancies in absolute value (average difference when using and neglecting noninformative offspring) were 0. 0146, 1. 64 cM, and 2. 61 for the <b>recombination</b> <b>fraction,</b> map distance, and the LOD score, respectively. A method for simultaneous estimation of allele frequencies in the dam population and a transmission disequilibrium parameter is proposed. This method might account for the bias in estimating allele frequencies in the dam population when the half-sib offspring is selected for production traits...|$|E
40|$|In linkage analysis, {{estimated}} <b>recombination</b> <b>fractions</b> {{between a}} disease gene and several markers {{are used to}} assign the disease gene to a particular chromosome region. For rare diseases, locus heterogeneity leads to different <b>recombination</b> <b>fractions</b> in different families, {{and a set of}} pedigrees can be regarded as a mixture.

We do not know whether such fractions have been seen in other data sets or whether other factors, e.g. differential viability of the organisms, may have caused the observed values of r> 1 / 2 in those older studies.|$|R

40|$|Provided {{that there}} is no {{chromatid}} interference, no movement of chiasmata, and no discrepancies between meiotic and mitotic chromosome lengths, then genetic maps and recombination fractions may be directly derived from our meiotic chiasma distribution data.

The <b>recombination</b> <b>fraction</b> between 13 p fluorescent markers and the proposed retinoblastoma locus at 13 q 14 is estimated at 0. 27 to 0. 37 and preliminary female chiasma studies suggest a <b>recombination</b> <b>fraction</b> of 0. 5 between these two sites. Therefore, it seems unlikely that 13 p fluorescent markers may be of any practical help in identifying retinoblastoma gene carriers.

40|$|The {{recurrent}} intermating of F(2) {{individuals for}} some number of generations followed by {{several generations of}} inbreeding produces an intermated recombinant inbred (IRI) population. Such populations are currently being developed in the plant-breeding community because linkage associations present in an F(2) population are broken down and a population of fixed inbred lines is also created. The increased levels of recombination enable higher-resolution mapping in IRI populations relative to F(2) populations. Herein we derive relationships, under several limiting assumptions, for determining the expected <b>recombination</b> <b>fraction</b> in IRI populations from the crossover rate per meiosis. These relationships are applicable to situations where the inbreeding component of IRI population development is by either self-fertilization or full-sib mating. Additionally, we show that the derived equations can be solved for the crossover rate per meiosis if the <b>recombination</b> <b>fraction</b> is known for the IRI population. Thus, the observed <b>recombination</b> <b>fraction</b> in any IRI population can be expressed on an F(2) basis.

With {{the development of}} molecular genetic technologies such as RFLP, multilocus data are readily available to researchers.

The estimators are consistent regardless of the model assumptions and are efficient if the model is a good approximation. The estimators are tractable even when there are incomplete observations. Furthermore, the interference between nonadjacent chromosomal regions or those among three chromosomal regions can be modeled and tested by a simple Z-test. The proposed method was applied to linkage analysis of four-locus data obtained from Drosophila and that of seven-locus data obtained again from Drosophila. Reanalysis of the first example revealed that there is interference between chromosomal regions 2 and 3.

In all, 700 F(2) populations were randomly simulated with and 400 individuals with different combinations of dominant and co-dominant markers, as well as 10 and 20 % of missing data. The simulations showed that, in the presence of co-dominant markers only, any combination of algorithm and criteria may be used, even for a reduced population size. In the case of a smaller proportion of dominant markers, any of the algorithms and criteria (except SALOD) investigated may be used. In the presence of high proportions of dominant markers and smaller samples (around 100), the probability of repulsion linkage increases between them and, in this case, use of the algorithms TRY and SER associated to RIPPLE with criterion LHMC would provide better results.
