50|$|During the {{production}} {{life of the}} Comanche, six different transmissions were offered, manufactured by Aisin, Chrysler, and Peugeot. Aisin provided the AX-4 (four-speed), AX-5 and AX-15 (five-speed overdrive) manual transmissions, along with the AW-4 four-speed automatic that was used beginning in 1987. This is the same Warner transmission used in early- to mid-1990s Toyota 4Runners with the 3.0 and some 22re 4wd. The AX-15 was phased in to replace the Peugeot BA-10/5 five-speed {{that had been used}} from 1987 until mid-1989 behind the 4.0 L I6 engine. The Comanche came equipped with a weight sensing <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bikes {{built in}} 2002 were {{recalled}} for a potentially leaky <b>brake</b> <b>proportioning</b> control <b>valve.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> {{was fitted}} to all 4 and 6 {{cylinder}} Centuras from factory {{to compensate for}} weight transfer during braking [...] When the car [...] "nose-dived" [...] under heavy braking, a mechanical link connected to the <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> reduced the <b>brake</b> pressure on the rear wheels, {{to prevent them from}} locking up and causing {{the back of the car}} to slide around. This was typical of many European cars of the time but uncommon in Australian cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{fire started}} before dawn on February 1, 1997, at Aisin Seiki Co.'s Factory No. 1 in Kariya, Japan. The {{cause of the}} fire was {{reportedly}} unknown. The factory produced <b>brake</b> fluid <b>proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> (P-valves) which help prevent skidding by controlling the pressure on <b>rear</b> <b>brakes,</b> and {{are used in the}} braking system of all Toyota vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|As per the {{technical}} paper published by Buschmann et al."The {{job of the}} EBD as a subsystem of the ABS system is to control the effective adhesion utilization by the rear wheels. The pressure of the rear wheels are approximated to the ideal brake force distribution in a partial braking operation. To do so, the conventional brake design is modified {{in the direction of}} rear axle overbraking, and the components of the ABS are used. EBD reduces the strain on the hydraulic <b>brake</b> force <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> in the vehicle. EBD optimizes the brake design with regard to: adhesion utilization; driving stability; wear; temperature stress; and pedal force." ...|$|R
50|$|However, the X-body {{developed}} a poor reputation for quality, due to engineering defects and related safety problems. Several running {{changes were made}} to the car's braking system during the first months of manufacture in 1979. Initial automobile magazine articles about the new car in the autumn of 1979 cited a dangerous tendency for the car to lock the rear wheels upon braking; then hundreds of complaints involving this behavior, including dozens of accidents, over a dozen injuries and one death triggering a lawsuit, were reported {{in the first year of}} manufacture, leading the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to pressure General Motors for some remedial action. Despite there being over a million of these automobiles on the road at that point, GM issued a voluntary recall of only the earliest manual transmission models, less than 50,000, declaring no safety involvement, and declining to publicize the recall. Internal documents, which eventually were leaked, revealed that GM's engineering staff were dubious that this modification to the <b>brake</b> <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> would be sufficient, even for the cars which were subject to the recall, and that further changes to the brake linings and brake drums would be required; that would have raised the cost from $70 a vehicle to $150, in addition to greatly increasing the number of cars involved.|$|R
50|$|A <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{pressure}} to the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> under heavy braking. This limits the <b>rear</b> <b>braking</b> to reduce the chances of locking up the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes,</b> and greatly lessens the chances of a spin.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{example is}} where spring load applies a {{reducing}} force {{so that the}} output pressure is reduced. <b>Proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> are frequently used in cars to reduce the brake fluid pressure to the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Safety wise, the Proton Juara came {{equipped}} with a reinforced body structure with anti-intrusion bars, as well as front ventilated disc <b>brakes</b> and <b>rear</b> drum <b>brakes</b> respectively. The brake line also has a load-sensing <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> which prevents rear wheel lock-up on wet surfaces when the Juara is lightly loaded. However, there are no airbags or an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS).|$|R
5000|$|The {{mounting}} for the <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> {{is different}} {{due to the}} hydraulic <b>rear</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|R
50|$|BMW Motorrad uses {{a system}} called Integral ABS, {{in which the}} front brake lever {{operates}} both the front and <b>rear</b> <b>brakes,</b> while the brake pedal operates only the <b>rear</b> <b>brake.</b> In the inverse, Honda's system that features both combined brakes and anti-lock brakes is dubbed Combined ABS. In this system, the <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> pedal operates both front and <b>rear</b> <b>brake,</b> and the front brake lever operates the front calipers, which in turn activates a secondary master cylinder to engage the <b>rear</b> <b>brake.</b> ABS modulators are installed on both {{the front and rear}} wheel.|$|R
5000|$|The six {{cylinder}} engines were {{fitted with}} a new Carter carburetor. A vacuum operated “Fuel Pacer” was offered as an option, the device using a flashing light to assist the driver in avoiding fuel wastage. This light was initially on the right-hand guard, but was later fitted to the instrument panel. Additional safety features included a pressure <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> in the <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> circuit, power-boosted brakes and hazard warning lights. Indicator, headlight dipping, headlight flashing and windscreen wiper controls were now housed in a steering column stalk. This was the first multi-purpose stalk control to be fitted {{by any of the}} “big three" [...] manufacturers, the other two being Ford Australia and General Motors-Holden's.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{configuration of}} the Arena consists {{of a combination of}} independent MacPherson strut suspensions from a saloon car at the front, and torsion beam, leaf sprung suspensions at the rear. Other modifications include the use of a rigid rear axle, an uprated front stabiliser bar, and 14" [...] front ventilated discs and 9" [...] <b>rear</b> drum <b>brakes</b> with load sensing <b>proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> (LSPV), optimised weight distribution and the use of reinforced high profile tyres. Lotus Engineering provided additional ride and handling enhancements.|$|R

50|$|A dummy-rim <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> was adopted.|$|R
50|$|A {{line lock}} is {{a device that}} allows the front brakes to lock {{independently}} of the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> via a switch. The device is an electric solenoid that controls a valve which allows the brakes to be controlled individually, this allows the front brakes to be locked and the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> to be open. This allows the driver to spin the rear wheels without wasting the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes.</b> This method {{is referred to as}} line lock and is popular among enthusiasts who like to do burnouts frequently.|$|R
5000|$|A drift-inducing {{technique}} called [...] "the brake drift" [...] {{is used in}} racing, involving a series of light <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> trail-braking pulses (usually 2 or 3), followed by a momentary full-force <b>rear</b> <b>braking</b> and sharp releasing of the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes.</b> Mastering continuous trail braking as used under road conditions {{is a prerequisite for}} learning brake drifting. This {{is one of the most}} used drifting techniques in rally racing because - if done properly - allows the driver to enter and exit the corner with full throttle.|$|R
50|$|For the 1921 Indianapolis 500 small <b>rear</b> wheels <b>brakes</b> {{only were}} fitted. Subsequently, Isotta Fraschini-type front wheel brakes {{actuated}} by hand lever, <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> actuated by right pedal.|$|R
500|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> of {{an upright}} bicycle can only produce about 0.25g (~2.5m/s2) {{deceleration}} at best, {{because of the}} decrease in normal force at the rear wheel as described above. All such bikes with only <b>rear</b> <b>braking</b> are subject to this limitation: for example, bikes with only a coaster brake, and fixed-gear bikes with no other braking mechanism. There are, however, situations that may warrant <b>rear</b> wheel <b>braking</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|Tadpole trikes tend also to use Ackermann {{steering}} geometry, {{perhaps with}} both front brakes {{operated by the}} stronger hand. While the KMX Kart stunt trike with this setup allows the <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> to be operated separately, letting the rider do [...] "bootlegger turns", the standard setup for most trikes has the front brake for each side operated by each hand. The center-of-mass of most tadpole trikes {{is close to the}} front wheels, making the <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> less useful. The <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> may instead be connected to a latching brake lever for use as a parking brake when stopped on a hill.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, trail braking is done {{exclusively}} {{with the front}} brake even though trailing the <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> will effectively slow the motorcycle, also decreasing the turning radius.
