40|$|The {{horizontal}} shear capacity of steel-concrete composite floors {{can only be}} determinedwith full scale experiments since no good theoretical model is available. Since {{the properties of the}} sheeting can change over time due to wear of the rollers, regular testing of the steel concrete slabs is therefore necessary. The last research on the ComFlor 210 is from 1993, so new research was conducted to control the results from the past and to get some new insights. In total 9 specimens where tested; three specimen with a length of 3. 6 metre, three specimen with a length of 5. 4 metre, 1 specimen with a length of 7. 2 metre, one specimen with end anchorage and the last specimen did not have <b>rib</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> the first eight specimen did have <b>rib</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The first objective was to determine the {{horizontal shear}} resistance of the ComFlor 210. To determine this resistance two methods where used, the first method was them¡k method and the second method the partial shear interaction method. For the first method clear results from the experiments where obtained {{that can be used in}} practice. For the second method the values that where obtained can also be used in practice, but some assumptions are made to obtain these values. These assumptions should also be made if this method is used. The most important assumption is that the area of the sheeting that is affected by the embossments is 12. 5 %. In the thesis a modification is made to use the partial shear connection method in practice. The method the Eurocode prescribes is designed for shallow decks and using this would give a too large resistance. Determining the effective area of the steel sheeting was also an objective, therefore strain gauges were located on three specimens. With these strain gauges the strain could bemeasured at different locations of the specimen and an effective area of every specimen was determined. Two specimen did have 21 strain gauges and one specimen only 7 strain gauges. The specimen with 21 strain gauges did have approximately the same effective area but the specimen with 7 strain gauge did have a much larger effective area. This area is larger because the strain was measured at fewer locations whereby the maximum strain in the sheeting was not measured. With the results of the two specimen an estimation for the effective area could be made, however more research is needed for this subject. The results of this are therefore not used in other parts of this thesis. The effect of a practical detail of the end anchorage that is often used was also examined, it could be concluded that this end anchorage did increase the bending moment resistance of the slab with 18 %. In the thesis is described how the effect of the end anchorage can be used in practice. Since only one experiment with end anchorage was executed, more research is needed for more statistical certainty, but it can be concluded that end anchorage does have a large positive effect on the shear length. The effect of the <b>rib</b> <b>reinforcement</b> on the bending moment capacity was also determined. In the thesis a calculation is used to determine the contribution of the reinforcement to the bending moment resistance. With this calculation the difference between the specimen with and without <b>rib</b> <b>reinforcement</b> could be explained, the determined influence of the reinforcement is a bit lower than the effect that the reinforcement does have in practice. The effect is a bit larger because the reinforcement holds the concrete together which does increase the longitudinal shear capacity. The last objective was to determine the bending moment resistance. Initially a long slab was used to determine the bending moment resistance, but the specimen with end anchorage did have a much larger bending moment at failure. With this it could be concluded that the long specimen did not fail on bending. since the cross section and properties of both specimen where essentially the same. The bending moment at failure for the specimen with end anchorage was lower than expected. This could mean that the calculation method for the bending moment capacity is incorrect or that this specimen did also not fail on pure bending.

The beam tests were conducted using composite slabs with two modern forms of profiled steel sheeting. Important parameters of the shear connection, such as stud diameter, number of studs per <b>rib,</b> <b>reinforcement</b> pattern, welding procedure and concrete strength, were varied. All the test configurations were selected in accordance with a previously conducted study on the behaviour of shear connectors in push-out specimens. A comparison of the bending resistance of the beam tests and the calculated plastic bending resistance is presented. The shear connector resistances were taken either from the push-out test results or from the analytical methods of Konrad, EN 1994 - 1 - 1 and Nellinger.

40|$|In this paper, {{the seismic}} {{vulnerability}} of single-leaf vaults undergoing horizontal actions is discussed, and an innovative strengthening technique is proposed. The extreme vulnerability of these structures was frequently assessed after recent earthquakes, when {{a significant number}} of single-leaf vaults collapsed, regardless of the earthquake intensity and of the level of the structure global damage; and highlights the need for structural strengthening interventions. In this paper, the vault seismic vulnerability is discussed {{based on the results of}} an experimental study on the behaviour of a single-leaf vault subjected to cyclic unsymmetrical loads. A special testing bench is adopted, which allows tilting the specimen both clockwise and counter-clockwise. In the tilted position, each vault segment is subjected to both relative vertical and horizontal forces, corresponding to the gravity load force components evaluated along and normal to the tilted axis. The resulting load distribution simulates the seismic action acting on the vault ring. Furthermore, lightweight ribs are proposed as an innovative solution to upgrade the seismic performance of existing single-leaf vaults. Ribs can be designed to behave like external retaining structure, preserving the vault shape by constraining the uplift deflection in the case of unsymmetrical load conditions. Further experimental tests will assess the efficiency of the proposed lightweight <b>rib</b> <b>reinforcement</b> solution, and clarify the role of the reinforcement-to-vault connection...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 Depremin meydana getirdiği hasarları analiz etmek kadar, deprem sonrasında yapının kullanıcı durumu açısından kimliğini belirlemek de oldukça önemlidir. 2007 Deprem Bölgelerinde Yapılacak Binalar Hakkındaki Yönetmelik (DBYBHY- 2007) mevcut bina performans değerlendirmesi ve güçlendirmesi konusunda mühendislere yol açmıştır. Bu yönetmelik kapsamında mevcut bina değerlendirmelerinde özellikle kolonların, yönetmelik dışı etriyelerle sargılandığında, gerçekten sargı etkisi gösterip göstermediği belirsiz bir problem olmuştur ve karar mekanizması bozulmuştur.   Bu çalışmanın amacı, yönetmelikte belirtilen kuralların dışında üretilen etriyelerin ve çirozların eksenel yük altında kolonda nasıl çalıştığını araştırarak, elemanın sargılı- sargısız beton davranışından hangisine daha yakın olduğunu belirlemektir. Böylelikle, yönetmelik şartlarının tartışılabilirliği deneysel olarak sunulmuştur. Çalışmada 8 adedi 25 x 25 x 50 cm³ boyutlarında kare prizma ve 14 adedi 25 x 37. 5 x 50 cm³ boyutlarında dikdörtgen prizma olmak üzere toplam 22 kare ve dikdörtgen kesitli kolon numuneleri yapılmıştır. Bunlardan 2 adet kare ve 2 adet dikdörtgen numune referans numunesi olarak imal edilmiştir ve etriyesizdir. Her kolonun etriyeleri ve (6 dikdörtgen numunenin) çirozları 90 ̊, 112. 5 ̊, 135 ̊ arasında değişen çeşitli kanca açılarına ve 40 mm ile 80 mm  kanca boylarına sahiptir. Mevcut binalara yönelik bir araştırma olduğu için, donatı olarak S 220, Φ 8 nervürsüz donatı ve 28 günlük beton basınç dayanımı yaklaşık 10 MPa olan düşük dayanımlı beton tercih edilmiştir. Ayrıca, sadece enine donatının çalışmasını görmek için boyuna donatı kullanılmamıştır. Etriyelerin iskelet halinde kalıba yerleştirilmesi için 0. 5 cm x 0. 5 cm kesit alanına sahip ahşap çıtalardan faydalanılmıştır. Dayanımını almış numuneler eksenel basınç altında test edilmişlerdir. Test aşamasında belirli yükler altındaki şekildeğiştirme dataları alınmıştır. Bu datalar işlenerek her numuneye ait gerilme- şekildeğiştirme ilişkileri bulunmuştur. Elde edilen ilişkiler, aynı deneysel şartlar için hesaplanmış matematiksel {{modeller}}le ait  gerilme-şekildeğiştirme ilişkileriyle kıyaslanmıştır. Bununla birlikte dayanım, süneklik ve enerji yutma kapasitesi açısından değerlendirmeler yapılmıştır. Çalışmada kullanılan matematiksel modeller, Mander Modeli, Saatçioğlu & Razvi Modeli ve İlki ve diğ. Modelidir.        Yapılan karşılaştırma sonuçlarına göre, beton dayanımı düşük olması sebebiyle, modeller yeterli tahmin oranını sağlayamamıştır. Bu da, düşük dayanımlı beton ve yetersiz sargılama durumu olması durumunda modellerin geliştirilmesi gerekliliğini göstermektedir. It is {{well known}} that analyzing the earthquake damage is important, but determine the structure identity after the earthquake is also important. Due to existing structures were constructed according inadequate construction knowledge and practice, construction conditions were not sufficient and unpredictable. Mostly, using low strength concrete and making inaquate confinement on RC beams and columns effects to building performance level.  Performance levels, immediate occupancy, life safety, collapse preventation determine characterstics of failure and correspondingly the utility of building after the earthquake motion. The performance calculation firstly used by SEAOC (Structural Engineers Association of California) in 1995. Also, ATC (Applied Technology Council) (1996) and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) suggested the calculation based on performance analysis. In Turkey, 2007 - SSBDA (Specification for Structures to be Built in Disaster Areas) led to engineers about the performance evaluation and strengthening of existing buildings. These standards specify the strain boundaries and failure mode for structural members. So, the engineer must decide by taking into consideration of existing standards. But the main problem is, in the concept of regulations on assessment of existing buildings, what if building has got low strength RC columns confined with substandard lateral reinforcement? Which performance level should be provided then? Cause of acceptance of inadequate confinement reduces the performance level and maybe makes the engineer decition too much conservative. This question impairs the decision- mechanism.   Basicly, in recent years theoretical and experimental studies proof that the lateral confinement increase the strength and ductility of concrete. Ductility defined as the ability of a material to withstand plastic deformation without rupture. Ductile materials show large deformation before fracture. Usually, if two materials have the same strength and hardness, the one that has the higher ductility is more desirable. At this point, adequate lateral confinement makes passive lateral pressure and resist expansion of concrete. This motion increases the capability of deformation of the concrete.   The effect of lateral confinement on concrete’s stress-strain relationship firstly considered by Consider and the first well-known study on the stress strain curve of concrete with and without confinement was conducted by Richart et al.. Since then there have been numerous analytical models presented in the literature which have been based either on tests on concrete specimens or columns with reinforcement. The earliest analytical models are attributed to Hognestad who used a parabolic expression for the stress strain relationship. Popovics, Sargin et al. proposed a mathematical fractional function for stress strain relationship. Further improvements were developed by Wang et al [...] Kent and Park used a fractional equation for the ascending part of stress strain curve and a linear function for descending part of the curve. Sheikh and Uzumeri studied the effects of the distribution and amount of longitudinal and lateral reinforcement, as well as the spacing of lateral ties on the response of reinforced concrete columns. Saatcioglu and Razvi used a second order parabola for the ascending branch, a linear descending branch and a constant residual strength equal to 20 % of peak strength.  Many authors looked at the behavior of reinforced concrete columns under compression and proposed confinement models which took account of various parameters such as tie spacing reinforcement, column shape and concrete strength. Some of the authors ave been mentioned above, while others include Hoshikuma et al., Hsu and Hsu, Razvi and Saatcioglu, Chung et al., Mander, Shah et al., Ilkı et al [...]    The aim of this experimental study, to investigate the relations of lightly confined substandard stirrups and crossties under the axial compression and determine the behavior of confinement. This experimental work may be answer the questions about the inadequate confined RC column behavior.      In this study, relatively larger size specimens with different hook length and hook angle were tested under axial compression. 6 square and 12 rectangular specimens that are confined by transverse reinforcement of various hook length (80 mm and 40 mm) and hook angle (90 º - 112, 5 º - 135 º) and 4 specimen for reference totally 22 specimen  tested under axial load. To invesitage existing buildings in the research prefered as reinforcement S 220, Φ 8 without <b>rib</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and a 28 -day cylinder concrete compressive strength of about 10 MPa low - strength concrete. Dimension of square RC columns and rectangular RC columns are 250 x 250 x 500 mm and 250 x 375 x 500 respectively. Longitudinal reinforcement was not also used in this study to measure the effectiveness of transverse reinforcement, only wooden slats were used.   Received samples were tested under monolotic compressive loads by using Instron Satec 1000 RD universal testing machine which capable of making displacement and force controlled loading with a capacity of 5000 kN. In the test setup, there were totally 8 strain gauge, 4 straingage replaced between the rods on each surface of sample and 4 strain gauge measured on the full length of the sample. During test, deformation datas were taken from these strain gauges under certain loads with datalogger. The displacement datas transformed to strain datas by dividing first length. The stress datas found by dividing the loads into the section area. For each sample, stress - strain relationship was found by process these datas.   The resulting compressive strength, deformability, ductility and stress-strain relationships were compared with mathematical models results for the same experimental conditions. Ductility defined mathematically by the ratio of the deformation corresponding 85 % strength on descending branch of stress- strain relationship to the strain corresponding to maksimum strength of confined concrete in this study.   The mathematical models used in this study are Mander Model, Saatcioglu & Razvi Model and Ilki et al. Model. These three model are well-accepted models for confined concrete. However, none of them designed for variable hook angle or hook length.   According to the comparison results, due to low concrete strength, models could not provide adequate estimates the rate. This low strength concrete, {{and in the case of}} insufficient wrapping condition indicates need to develop models. However, It is observed that low quality of concrete or lack of adequate confinement still increases the expected strength and ductility surprisingly. Even 90 degree hook angle, confinement provided and the effective area of the column worked and kept going to deformation. Hook length was also a parameter on ductility by penetrated to concrete and secured the working effective area.  Depend on hook angle and length descending parts of stress- strain relationships of samples were variable and because of low strength concrete, the behavior of lateral transverse reinforcement could not observed exactly. During the test loading, firstly low strength concrete rose to the pick load and then slowly damaged by deformations. Thereby, the power dissipation on the concrete made separation and lateral confinement kept out of effective parameter.   Due to analytical approaches proposed by Ilki et al., Saatcioglu and Razvi,  Mander et al. with the test results, Ilki et al. model predict the stress- strain relation and ductility with a high degree of probability. Then Saatcioglu and Razvi model give a good approximation on espacially maksimum strength, but the discending branch did not match with experimental datas. However, Mander Model was unsuccesful to determinate maksimum strength of concrete and ductility for rectangular and square columns.   Consequently,  a new model must be proposed for existing RC structures by taking account of various parameters such as hook angle, hook length, tie spacing reinforcement and concrete strength.

40|$|<b>Ribbed</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is {{described}} as “high bond” in Eurocode 2 (EC 2) and within the code serviceability checks make no allowance for variations in either the ductility or bond characteristics of these bars. In this work, this matter is explored, and the crack development and behaviour of concrete beams reinforced with various types of ribbed steel bar are investigated, using both numerical and experimental approaches. The objective of the experimental approach is to undertake a series of experiments to compare the performance of beams made with standard reinforcement with that of beams formed with a new high-ductility bar produced by CELSA UK. The relationship between the bond strength and the rib pattern of reinforcing steel was studied and the behaviour at SLS load levels of RC beams with <b>reinforcement</b> of different <b>rib</b> patterns in flexure is discussed. The cracking of beams was monitored both visually and using a non-destructive Digital Image Correlation system to trace in-plane deformations and strains {{on the surface of}} the specimens. The test results showed that specimens with bars which had the highest relative rib area (fR value) exhibited the smallest crack spacing and crack width. A numerical model was developed to explore the crack development of reinforced concrete beams under flexural loading. The model employed a non-linear material model for concrete and a smeared crack approach. In order to address the well known numerical stability problems, associated with softening models, a non-local gradient method was used. Crack widths cannot be obtained directly from such models, due to the diffuse nature of non- local simulations, therefore a post-processing procedure was developed to allow the crack characteristics to be calculated. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the satisfactory performance of the model. In addition, a series of numerical simulations of the BOND AND CRACKING OF REINFORCED CONCRETE Simon H. C. Chan Page vi experimental beams tested in the present study were used validate the numerical model and conversely, to provide confidence in the consistency of the experimental results.

40|$|The role of {{reinforcement}} elements in coal mine ribs {{has not been}} well understood. Various approaches to <b>rib</b> support and <b>reinforcement</b> are in use in the industry with mixed results. Rib spall is not uncommon and can vary from small nuisance fragments of coal to large scale collapse of the full rib surface, often with serious safety implications. This paper describes the outcomes of an ACARP research project which investigated rib behaviour to identify the geotechnical mechanics involved and then evaluated some prototype reinforcement strategies based {{on the concept of}} yielding support elements...|$|R
5000|$|The second-generation 4A-GE {{produced}} from 1987 to 1989 featured larger diameter bearings for the connecting-rod big ends (42 mm) and added four additional <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ribs</b> {{on the back}} of the engine block, for a total of seven. The T-VIS feature is maintained. It is visually similar to the first-generation engine (only the upper cam cover now featured red and black lettering) and the US market power output was only increased to [...] The first- and second-generation engines are very popular with racers and tuners because of their availability, ease of modification, simple design, and lightness.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A non-linear finite element model has been developed to analyse reinforced concrete structures taking into account : (1) non-linear concrete behaviour under biaxial stress, (2) progressive cracking of the concrete, and (3) interaction between the reinforcement and the concrete matrix commonly known as bond. Three dimensional reinforced concrete components are analysed by an approximate two dimensional plane stress model. Bond {{is considered to be}} a concentric layer surrounding the reinforcement modelled by a 6 noded rectangular 'shearing' element. The concrete is represented by 8 noded isoparametric membrane elements and the reinforcement by 3 noded isoparametric bar elements. The finite element model uses, an incremental iterative solution technique known as the 'Initial stress method' and a special solution technique to allow for cracking of the concrete. stiffnesses within elements are evaluated by numerical integration using Gaussian Quadrature, with elastic moduli stored at the sampling positions. The bond model is based upon an assumed non-linear relationship between bond stress and slip in which the localised ultimate bond stress' is a function of both the lateral pressures exerted by the concrete on the reinforcement and the radial contraction of the bar' due to Poisson's effect. Allowance is also made for the deterioration of bond when the slip exceeds a tolerance value. The concrete model is a non-linear elastic fracture model based upon the 'Equivalent uniaxial strain approach' as developed by Darwin and Pecknold (1974). Cracking of the concrete is assumed to be 'smeared' within the concrete element. Reinforced concrete components which have been analysed include; the ordinary pullout test, double ended pull out test, a transfer test, and a beam-column intersection. A small experimental programme was conducted to obtain reliable data as to the nature of the bond stress and reinforcement strain distributions in the double-ended pullout test, the transfer test and the beam-column intersection. To determine the reinforcement strain distributions, plain round bars or <b>ribbed</b> <b>reinforcement</b> bars in the case of the beam-column, were embedded in the concrete specimens with electrical strain gauges attached. The author's computer programs are explained and listed in the appendices...|$|R

50|$|The first-generation 4A-GE {{which was}} {{introduced}} in 1983 replaced the 2T-G as Toyota's most popular twincam engine. This engine was identifiable via silver cam covers with the lettering on the upper cover painted black and blue, {{as well as the}} presence of three <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ribs</b> on {{the back side of the}} block. It was extremely light and strong for a production engine using an all-iron block, weighing in at only 123 kg - over fifteen percent reduction compared to 2T-GEU. It was also 4 dB quieter. While originally conceived of as a two-valve design, Toyota and Yamaha changed the 4A-GE to a four-valve after a year of evaluation.|$|R
50|$|Synthetic {{materials}} used for residential fences {{can be in}} a solid cast form, or a reinforced hollow rail design that resembles sawn timber, Most commonly extruded profiles. Higher quality vinyl fence components are <b>ribbed</b> or include <b>reinforcements,</b> often of aluminum, for added strength. For agricultural use, synthetic fencing can consist of a heavy synthetic strapping product inlaid with cable, synthetic-coated high-tensile wire, or a synthetic coating over a wood or metal rail or plank. Residential synthetic fencing products are usually hollow, and thus too fragile to contain livestock, but some designs may be suitable for containing dogs or other pets. Residential grade rails are also made of a thinner material.|$|R

The aim of my research was to gain experience in early detection of crack formation on concrete structures. In the experiments, plain and reinforced beams were bended up to the failure and pull-out tests were carried out. <b>Ribbed</b> and plain <b>reinforcements</b> were used for the simulation of new and old concrete structures. The results of the aforementioned studies indicate that cracks and their locations can be detected much earlier by AT than by visual inspection. Through the experiments, the Kaiser effect was observed as well. All the experiments were performed in ZAG – Slovene National Building and Civil Engineering Institute, Ljubljana...|$|R
