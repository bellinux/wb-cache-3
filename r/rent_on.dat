5|$|On 20 October 1993, the {{municipal}} council {{voted in favor}} of purchasing the stadium. The proposal was supported by the Labour Party and Centre Party, who had 28 of 49 councilors, but opposed {{by the rest of the}} council. Along with two banks, {{the municipal}}ity established a limited company which would own the venue. The municipality and banks would pay for the club's debt of NOK5.4 million, and take over the stadium's operating costs of roughly NOK1 million per year. Ham-Kam would have to pay <b>rent</b> <b>on</b> the stadium. The transaction took place on 26 January 1994, and included a clause granting Ham-Kam the right to buy back the stadium at a later date. The municipality issued a loan of NOK4 million to Ham-Kam in 2003 to allow them to install floodlighting at Briskeby.|$|E

On 27 April 2012, {{it was announced that}} Malmö FF were close to buying the full 25% of stocks owned by Erling Pålsson and 25% of the stocks owned by Peab, increasing their own share to 75% and leaving Peab with a 25% share. On 1 May 2012, Malmö Stad granted the bailment needed for Malmö FF to buy the stocks. The deal, worth 90 million kronor, was finalised on 13 June 2012. The long-term goal for Malmö FF is to buy the remaining 25% of the stocks to fully own Swedbank Stadion.|$|E

By 2003, it was attracting 5,200 visitors a year, of which 4,200 were from abroad. He put the museum up for sale in 2003, but also offered it to the city of Reykjavík as a gift.

5|$|Disaster {{occurred}} on Lady Day 1644, when an exceptionally high tide flooded the Upper Levels, and {{broke through the}} walls of the New Salt Channel. The Commissioners authorised {{the construction of a new}} sea sluice at Kent Wall, and work began in May 1646, but in September, they decided that it should be built at Blackwall instead. The height of Knelle Dam was regularly adjusted, in an attempt to manage the amount of water that still flowed along the Appledore Channel, and the conflicting needs of navigation and drainage. The Great Freshwater Sluice below Appledore deteriorated, and failed in 1650. A new sluice with three channels was built in 1669. The financial burden on the Upper Levels as a result of the sea entering the Wittersham Levels was huge, as they had to pay <b>rent</b> <b>on</b> all land that was not available to its original owners, and so in 1671, an agreement was reached that the sea would be excluded from the levels. Work began in 1680 to enclose areas of land on both sides of the valley, and was largely completed by 1684. The work included a new embanked channel for the Rother, which was built along the southern edge of the valley. It was called the Craven Channel, and ended at Craven Sluices.|$|E

40|$|Neoclassical economists {{argue that}} {{competition}} promotes efficiency, but Schumpeter {{argues that it}} is monopoly rents that help entrepreneurs to invest in R&D. We investigate the overall effect of competition on total factor productivity growth (TFP) growth. We use rent, defined as the factor reward above its perfectly competitive value, as a negative measure of competition. Our main finding is that performance is positively associated with <b>rents</b> <b>on</b> capital but not with <b>rents</b> <b>on</b> labor. Neoclassical economists and Schumpeter may both be right, but the mechanisms differ. ...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to analyse the impact of {{interactions}} between tax rates and agglomeration <b>rents</b> <b>on</b> location decisions of firms within Belgium. In the theoretical literature it is argued that both location determinants may weaken each other’s impact. Using the number of new firms at the sector level for 43 Belgian districts, we show that local effective tax rates either have no or a negative impact on location decisions. Moreover, both types of agglomeration rents in a district are important for location decisions. The presence of firms in a district attracts new firms, while the presence of firms in the same sector deters firm entry due to competition. However, the interaction effect between taxes and agglomeration <b>rents</b> <b>on</b> firm entry is significant. We show that a higher effective tax rate in a district weakens the positive impact of the agglomeration <b>rents</b> <b>on</b> location decisions of firms. ...|$|R
