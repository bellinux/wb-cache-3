5|$|Charitable trusts in English law are {{a form of}} {{express trust}} {{dedicated}} to charitable goals. There {{are a variety of}} advantages to charitable trust status, including exception from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust. To be a valid charitable trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit. Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into categories for public benefit including the <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty,</b> the promotion of education, the advancement of health and saving of lives, promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by the law. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.|$|E
5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty,</b> provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E

In Dingle v Turner, a charitable trust was established to help poor employees of Dingle & Co. While the beneficiaries were all linked by a personal relationship (their employer), the courts ruled that poverty is {{an exception to the}} Oppenheim rule. Academics Richard Edwards and Nigel Stockwell argue that this is because allowing such trusts to exist relieves the rest of society for having to provide for poor people; as a result, there is [...] "public benefit" [...] in a wider way. The general public benefit rule in the [...] "poverty" [...] {{category is}} that [...] "gifts for the <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> among poor people of a particular description" [...] is charitable; [...] "gifts to particular persons, the <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> being the motive of the gift" [...] are not.|$|E

40|$|Nexus between income {{inequality}} and technology capture is explored {{in a global}} CGE model to explore the ricochet effect of technology transmission and its capture.

The Huguenots brought with them little, apart from their skills, and an Order in Council of 16 April 1687 raised £200,000 for the <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> their <b>poverty.</b> In December 1687, the first report of the committee set up to administer the funds reported that 13,050 French refugees were settled in London, primarily around Spitalfields, {{but also in the}} nearby settlements of Bethnal Green, Shoreditch, Whitechapel and Mile End New Town.|$|R

But if the most recent evidence does point to a further concern <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> and inequality in the state, they also point to the significant effectiveness of social policy in addressing these needs based on the combination of improvements in productivity and wages of the poorest workers (structural reduction <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> and inequality), with the construction and expansion of a social safety net and more focused and increasingly generous (immediate <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> extreme <b>poverty).</b> Thus, on the one hand, yet cannot be said that poverty and inequality have been reduced to acceptable levels, secondly, the extremely fast progress achieved over the past two decades, particularly over the last five years, shows the effectiveness of the current social policy.

The chapter is an analysis of LIS data for twelve of these countries and explores the contribution of child support to the reduction in child poverty. The LIS analysis compares the prevalence and characteristics of lone parents, explores the proportion of families with children receiving child maintenance, and the contribution that it made to their income and the reduction <b>of</b> child <b>poverty</b> circa 2000. Child maintenance made a comparatively small contribution to the <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> child <b>poverty</b> overall, but if lone parents actually received child maintenance the poverty reduction achieved was much more significant. The impact of child maintenance also varied according to whether the lone parent was or was not in employment. For lone parents in employment in the UK, child maintenance could reduce child poverty by over two-thirds - {{more than any other}} country except Austria, France and the Netherlands. However, it was not more effective overall because comparatively few non-widowed lone parents had employment and child maintenance in the UK. See also Bradshaw, J.

40|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930 s, {{millions}} of Americans suffered from long term unemployment and subsistence poverty while {{the federal government}} 2 ̆ 7 s New Deal attempted {{to address the problems}} <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> But the rural poor were affected by a kind <b>of</b> chronic <b>poverty</b> that would prove more difficult to address with government-run relief efforts. Because traditional methods <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> from <b>poverty</b> were embedded in the socioeconomic culture of rural America, it was not always possible to apply the same federal relief methods in the countryside as in the urban areas of the nation. The rural poor stood to benefit from modern social relief services and, for a brief period, it seemed as if those services would become available for their benefit. However, as I argue in this dissertation, economic conservatism hindered the potential effectiveness of the two-year federal emergency relief program. From 1933 to 1935, the United States federal government backed the unprecedented expenditure {{of billions of dollars in}} direct emergency relief. Abiding the advice of prominent social workers, the government created an emergency relief program to address the alarming needs of impoverished Americans. These programs affected those who suffered the effects of long term unemployment and those trapped in rural poverty. The federal government created social welfare policies that had the power to ease the misery of those forced to subsist at the bottom. Government benefits and impoverished beneficiaries met through social work. For a brief span of time, the New Deal emergency <b>relief</b> period <b>of</b> early 1933 to mid- 1935 offered an opportunity for social workers to promote a nationalized system of social welfare. This is an understudied aspect of American history, and is the focus of this dissertation...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in clarifying the social milieu of the biblical wisdom literature. Although scholars are certainly not in complete agreement on this issue, nevertheless many have convincingly argued for an urban elite educational background as the well-spring of wisdom thought. This paper explores this thesis through a consideration of wisdom teaching on poverty. The study begins with a brief sketch of the royal tendencies and influences present in the book of Proverbs. The view defended here is that the values and interests of the wisdom writers are the same as those of the urban elite whom they serve. There follows a detailed consideration of the distinctive use of the Hebrew terms for poor in the book of Proverbs. An examination of this vocabulary sets in sharp <b>relief</b> the view <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> held by the wise. In the course of this essay it will be seen that, in their understanding of the causes and theological dimensions <b>of</b> <b>poverty,</b> the wise differed significantly from other strains of the biblical tradition, in particular the Hebrew prophets. The evidence of the wisdom vocabulary on poverty confirms the view that the wise are the purveyors of urban values. 1. Social Background of the Wisdom Literature Many argue that the materials in Proverbs have their origins in the life and needs of the royal court. Several scholars see evidence for this view in the fact that the Egyptian and Mesopotamian wisdom writings were produced by the court schools (cf. Gordis 1971 : 163...|$|R
