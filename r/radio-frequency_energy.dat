They are driven by high-frequency (approximately 35 kHz) alternating current at 2-5 kV. The drive circuit is essentially a specialized power inverter, in which current from a lower-voltage DC supply powers a high-frequency electronic oscillator circuit whose output is stepped up by a high-frequency, high-voltage transformer. The <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>energy</b> from the transformer is transmitted into the gas within the globe through an electrode at its center.

We tested, both in vitro and in vivo, {{a new technique}} for creating long linear atrial lesions with a custom-made, 25 -mm long, stainless-steel, linear probe and a corresponding 500 -kHz generator for assistance in the maze operation. Methods: In the in vitro study with the isolated canine atria, {{the power of the}} delivered <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>energy</b> and the saline irrigating flow rate were changed independently, and the sizes of the lesions were measured. In the in vivo study <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>energy</b> was delivered to 4 portions (ie, the smooth and trabeculated portions of the right and left atria). The sizes of the lesions were measured, and the histologic features of the lesions were examined. Electrical isolation of the right atrial appendage from the remaining right atrium was attempted by using this linear probe. Results: In the in vitro study the size of the lesion became larger as the delivered power was increased, although the lesion was limited when the flow rate was high. In the in vivo study the size of the lesion was equal at the 4 different sites. Histologic examinations demonstrated linear and transmural lesions, and electrophysiologic examinations revealed conduction block between the right atrial appendage and the remaining right atrium. Conclusions: The new original long linear probe was effective for creating transmural linear atrial lesions with the irrigation method, presenting the possibility of an intraoperative technique that mimics the maze procedure.
