40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyses}} {{the measurement}} {{demands of the}} mechanical-press ram displacement waveform on the sample frequency and displacement resolution. A virtual instruction system was developed that contains a USB 2069 data acquisition card and a software based LabVIEW, and a Hall sensor sensitizes the displacement especially at the <b>ram</b> <b>bottom</b> dead center (BDC). The paper describes and explains the characteristic behaviors of the ram displacement curve on the macro shape and the micro waveforms of BDC in various shutheights. The discussion indicates that a flat bottom region of BDC waveform {{is due to the}} clearance between the transmission devices and the elastic distortion of the press frame, and the position of the punch backward departure is a steady inflexion point, which is the best BDC bottommost position. Based the time of flat BDC region, the clearance values can be calculated...|$|R

30|$|We {{selected}} the following parameters by assuming a general melt-rich magma reservoir, since the exact properties beneath Aso volcano are unclear. The prescribed densities are − 0.3  g/cm 3 for low-density bodies, + 0.3  g/cm 3 for high-density bodies, and 0  g/cm 3 for neutral-density bodies (i.e., the background). This density contrast {{is assumed to}} represent the low-density material as a mixture of 50 % melt with some gas and 50 % solid crystals, at which ratio the rheology shifts from viscous to rigid (Marsh 1996). At the same time, we considered basaltic andesite and granite to represent the high- and moderate-density material, respectively. The homogeneity parameter is 0.2, which results in abrupt transitions in density across {{the boundaries of the}} resultant anomalous bodies, e.g., the boundary between a magma reservoir and the surrounding rock. The mean grid length in the inversion model was set to 500  m; this is the finest grid size that can be inverted in a reasonable amount of computing time using our algorithm and hardware (using an Intel Xeon E 5 - 1620 CPU with 16.0  GB <b>RAM).</b> The <b>bottom</b> and top of the model were set to 15  km below sea level and 0.6  km above sea level, respectively. The optimal value determined for the balance factor was 47.46.|$|R

30|$|The top fixture {{is fixed}} to load cell of the Instron machine and is stationary. The bottom fixture is {{attached}} to moving ram of the machine. The sample is held between these two fixtures. The Instron machine has a maximum capacity up to 4 ton. The load cell is kept below the top stud. The <b>bottom</b> <b>ram</b> moves {{up and down with}} the maximum ram stroke up to ± 125 mm. The system is hydraulically operated and can operate at quasi-static and transient load conditions. The ram on which tube is kept was moved up with speed of 5 mm/min to ensure the quasi-static condition. The alignment of the sample and its fixture is assured with the machine axis. The testing was done to the maximum displacement up to 150 mm.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{its lack}} of clear {{boundaries}} and a perceived lack of identity in its folk music, the English Midlands attracted relatively {{little interest in the}} early revivals. However, in more recent years a distinct cultural heritage has been recognised including unique folk traditions and songs, many associated with the regions industrial connections. It has also produced a number of important performers and some particular local instruments, such as the Lincolnshire bagpipes, however the last player, John Hunsley, died in the 19th century and no actual examples of the pipes have survived. From the 19th century the instruments used appear to have been much like those in other regions, with fiddles, accordions and eventually silver and brass. Although, some traditions, like Molly dance died out in the 1930s, the Midlands retained strong traditions of both ceremonial and social dance, particularly in the south Midlands and Cotswolds and in the distinctive Border Morris from Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. The region also furnished some important material for folk songs, including a claim by Nottinghamshire {{for one of the most}} popular series of ballads, that of Robin Hood, while local places appear in songs such as ‘The Leicester Chambermaid’ and ‘Oxford’ or ‘Worcester City’. Folk song collecting in the first revival was much less comprehensive than for many other regions. In the 1860s Llewellynn Jewitt, collected songs from Derbyshire, and some songs were printed by Georgina F. Jackson in her study of Shropshire folk lore. Cecil Sharp’s interest in the region was largely confined to the south, particularly the Cotswold morris villages of Oxfordshire and Warwickshire, which provided him with an archetype of English ceremonial dance. From 1905 Percy Grainger was actively collecting in Lincolnshire, acquiring recordings of songs that would provide the basis for his Lincolnshire Posy (1937). It was not until the early 1970s that the broader heritage of the region, including the many industrial and work songs associated with mining or The Potteries, began to gain serious attention. Despite this neglect there was an active folk scene in the region, which produced several key artists of the second revival from the 1960s, including Anne Briggs from Nottinghamshire, The Settlers from the West Midlands and from Birmingham one of the most influential groups of the period, the Ian Campbell Folk Group, which numbered among its members later British folk rock musicians Dave Swarbrick and Dave Pegg. Slightly later a number of folk groups came out of Derbyshire, including The Druids, <b>Ram's</b> <b>Bottom</b> Band and Muckram Wakes, which included one of the most highly regarded modern performers John Tams. Lincolnshire has produced Martin Simpson, perhaps the most highly regarded folk guitarist of his generation. Birmingham’s position as a centre for folk music has been emphasised by its place as the home of the Birmingham Conservatoire Folk Ensemble, led by former Albion Band fiddler Joe Broughton, which provides something of a clearing house of promising young folk musicians. The regions has numerous folk clubs and host many major folk festivals, including those of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, Loughborough in Leicestershire, Shrewsbury in Shropshire, Warwick and Moseley.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of Caesar's first bridge took place most likely between Andernach and Neuwied, downstream of Koblenz on the Rhine River. Book 4 (Liber IV) of his commentaries gives technical {{details of this}} wooden beam bridge. Double timber pilings were <b>rammed</b> into the <b>bottom</b> end of the river by winching up a large stone and releasing it, thereby driving the supporting posts (or piling) into the riverbed. The most upstream and downstream pilings were slanted and secured by a beam, and multiple segments of these then linked up to {{form the basis of}} the bridge. Conflicting models have been presented based on his description. Separate upstream pilings were used as protective barriers against flotsam and possible attacks while guard towers protected the entries. The length of the bridge has been estimated to be 140 to 400 m (roughly 460 to 1,300 ft), and its width 7 to 9 m. The depth of the river can reach up to 9.1 m.|$|R
60|$|Preparations for a Storm.--Before a storm, dig a ditch {{as deep as}} you can {{round the}} outside of the tent, to divert the coming sheet of surface-water, and see that the ditch has a good out-fall. The ditch will also drain the floor of the tent, if the rain should soak in. Even a furrow {{scratched}} with a tent-peg, is better than no ditch at all. Fasten guy-ropes to the spike of the tent-pole; and be careful that the tent is not too much on the strain, else the further shrinking of the materials, {{under the influence of the}} wet, will certainly tear up the pegs. Earth, banked up round the bottom of the tent, will prevent gusts of wind from finding their way beneath. It is also a good plan to prepare a small hole near the foot of the tent-pole, with a stone firmly <b>rammed</b> into the <b>bottom,</b> into which the tent-pole may be shifted, as soon as the strain of the tent, under the influence of the wet, becomes dangerous to its safety.|$|R
5000|$|C type presses have a {{bed plate}} {{which is used}} to lock the die bottom bolster. For locking the die, T bolts are used and so this plate contain 'T - slots into which t- bolts are slid in. These slots are placed diagonally and with a slot {{horizontal}} to the longer side of the plate, is the general practice. These slots run up to a central hole made in the plate, the hole being large enough to accommodate another bush with a hole, the hole being used for dropping the punched part {{to the bottom of the}} press. The top of the tool butted against a vertical sliding ram with a clamping system which accommodates only a particular diameter of a threaded cylindrical member called the [...] "shank" [...] of the tool. The bottom portion of the tool is locked to the bottom bed plate and the top portion of the tool is locked to the sliding <b>ram.</b> Top and <b>bottom</b> portions of the tool are generally guided by suitable pillar and bush assemblies, which gives safety to the punching elements of the tool.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{crossbeam}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} supporting parts of large gantry CNC machines. The deformation of the crossbeam under loads at work has great impact on integrated machining errors of machines. However, the crossbeam assembly’s structure and the corresponding loads are so complex that it’s difficult to get them through experiences and analytic methods. In this paper, the FE statics analysis method is used to simulate and analysis of the crossbeam under six main working conditions, obtaining deformation and stress distribution of the crossbeam under each conditions. The results show that when the slippery saddle is at the middle of the crossbeam and the ram extends to 100 % length (the distance between the end of <b>ram</b> and the <b>bottom</b> of slippery saddle is 1. 29 m), the total deformation of the crossbeam assembly is 6. 4914 × 10 - 5 m, the maximum deformation is up to 3. 4872 × 10 - 5 m, and the maximum stress is 1. 1882 × 10 7 Pa appearing at the hole of the drive shaft. The design of the crossbeam can meet the work requirements well. And analysis results present a basis for further optimization analysis and structural improvements of the crossbeam...|$|R
2500|$|In 1907, Captain Johnson {{was still}} in charge of Mount Royal. On the {{afternoon}} of July 6, [...] he was returning from Hazelton and was steaming through the Kitselas Canyon, when disaster struck. A strong wind pushed her into a large rock formation named Ringbolt Island, wedging her crosswise against the current. Luckily, she held while the passengers and crew scrambled to safety on the shore. Johnson assessed the situation and decided that Mount Royal could be saved and with ten crewmen, he returned aboard. He had decided {{that the best way}} to deal with this problem was to use the capstan to winch the sternwheeler back over Ringboat Island. This proved to be a disastrous decision. The king post broke and <b>rammed</b> through the <b>bottom</b> of Mount Royal and she buckled as the current washed over her, then she rolled upside down and broke into pieces. Although Johnson survived, six of the crewmen drowned, including the first officer. One of the four survivors was rescued by George Little, who would later become the founder of the town of Terrace. George and a companion spotted the wrecked hull as the wreckage floated past the community of Kitselas. Curious, they paddled out to it and saw a hand waving at them from a hole in hull. The survivor was Mount Royals chief engineer, Ben Maddigan, who was trapped in the bilge and filthy, but unhurt. After George Little chopped him out, Little commented that there must have been some air down there. The exhausted engineer replied, [...] "I don’t know about air, but there was one hell of a lot of water!" ...|$|R
