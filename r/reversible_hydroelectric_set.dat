These turbines could operate as both turbine-generators and in reverse as electric motor driven pumps. The latest in large-scale engineering technology are variable speed machines for greater efficiency. These machines operate in synchronization with the network frequency when generating, but operate asynchronously (independent of the network frequency) when pumping.|$|R

Firstly, the optimal model of the main parts of <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>sets</b> is established including an objective function and some constraint conditions. Afterwards, the stochastic direction method (SDM) and a genetic algorithm (GA) method are applied to solve the optimal model. Comparing the computational results of the two methods, some features of the methods are pointed out. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the above two methods, a new method, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), is presented, and is used to optimize {{the structure of the}} main parts of <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>sets.</b> The computational results show the new method can obtain a global solution with a high search speed compared to the other two methods...|$|R

40|$|In modern <b>reversible</b> <b>hydroelectric</b> power {{stations}} {{it is possible}} to reverse the turbine and pump water up from a downstream reservoir to an upstream one. This allows the use of the same volume of water repeatedly and was speciﬁcally developed for hydro-electric stations operating with insuﬃcient water supply. Pumping water upstream is usually done at times of low demand for electricity, to build up reserves {{in order to be able}} to produce energy during peak hours, thus balancing the load and making a proﬁt on the price diﬀerence. In this paper, we consider a branched model for hydroelectric {{power stations}} interacting in a complex cascade arrangement. The goal of this study is to provide guidance in decision-making aimed at maximizing the proﬁt. A detailed analysis is made of a simpler reservoir conﬁguration, which indicates that even though the problem is nonlinear, a bang-bang type of control is optimal, where the power stations are operated at maximum rates of ﬂow. Some simple relation- ships between price and timing of decisions are calculated directly. A numerical algorithm is also developed...|$|R

5000|$|The worlds largest form {{of storage}} for excess electricity, pumped-storage is a <b>reversible</b> <b>hydroelectric</b> plant. They are a net {{consumer}} of energy but provide storage for any source of electricity, effectively smoothing {{peaks and troughs}} in electricity supply and demand. Pumped storage plants typically use [...] "spare" [...] electricity during off peak periods to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir. Because the pumping takes place [...] "off peak", electricity is less valuable than at peak times. This less valuable [...] "spare" [...] electricity comes from uncontrolled wind power and base load power plants such as coal, nuclear and geothermal, which still produce power at night even though demand is very low. During daytime peak demand, when electricity prices are high, the storage is used for peaking power, where water in the upper reservoir is allowed to flow back to a lower reservoir through a turbine and generator. Unlike coal power stations, which can take more than 12 hours to start up from cold, a hydroelectric generator can be brought into service in a few minutes, ideal to meet a peak load demand. Two substantial pumped storage schemes are in South Africa, Palmiet Pumped Storage Scheme and another in the Drakensberg, Ingula Pumped Storage Scheme.|$|R

40|$|Currently, the <b>hydroelectric</b> {{generating}} <b>sets</b> {{of small}} HPPs with Pelton turbines employ as their generating units conventional synchronous generators with electromagnetic excitation. To {{deal with the}} torque pulsatile behaviour, they generally install a supplementary flywheel on the system shaft that levels the pulsations. The Pelton turbine power output is adjusted by the needle changing water flow in the nozzle, whose advancement modifies the nozzle area and eventually – the flow. They limit the needle full stroke time to 20 – 40 sec. since quick shutting the nozzle for swift water flow reduction may result in pressure surges. For quick power adjustment so-called deflectors are employed, whose task is retraction of water jets from the Pelton turbine buckets. Thus, the mechanical method of power output regulation requires agreement between the needle stroke inside the turbine nozzles and the deflector. The paper offers employing frequency-controlled synchronous machines with permanent magnets qua generating units for the <b>hydroelectric</b> generating <b>sets</b> of small HPPs with Pelton turbines. The developed computer model reveals that this provides {{a higher level of}} adjustability towards rapid-changing loads in the grid. Furthermore, this will replace the power output mechanical control involving the valuable deflector drive and the turbine nozzle needles with electrical revolution rate and power output regulation by a frequency converter located in the generator stator circuit. Via frequency start, the controllable synchronous machine ensures stable operation of the <b>hydroelectric</b> generating <b>set</b> with negligibly small amount of water (energy carrier). Finally, in complete absence of water, the frequency-relay start facilitates shifting the generator operation to the synchronous capacitor mode, which the system operating parameter fluctograms obtained through computer modeling prove.  </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{mathematical model}} for hydroturbine governing system (HTGS) has been proposed. All essential components of HTGS, that is, conduit system, turbine, generator, and hydraulic servo system, are {{considered in the}} model. Using the proposed model, the existence and stability of Hopf bifurcation of an example HTGS are investigated. In addition, chaotic characteristics of the system with different system parameters are studied extensively and presented {{in the form of}} bifurcation diagrams, time waveforms, phase space trajectories, Lyapunov exponent, chaotic attractors, and Poincare maps. Good correlation can be found between the model predictions and theoretical analysis.

Although the current scale of dam-related developments far outstrips anything {{which took place in}} the past, the region has been no stranger to dam-related conflicts. For example, the Kaptai dam, built in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in the 1960 s, submerged the traditional homelands of the Hajong and Chakma indigenous communities, and forced them to migrate into parts of Northeast India. Over the years, this has led to serious conflicts between the refugees and local communities in Arunachal Pradesh"...|$|R

40|$|The {{variations}} of the supporting condition, which change the stiffness of tilting pad thrust bearing, may alter the dynamic behavior of the rotor system. The effects of supporting condition of thrust pad on the lateral vibration of a <b>hydroelectric</b> generating <b>set</b> are investigated in this paper. The action of a thrust bearing is described as moments acting on the thrust collar, and the tilting stiffness coefficients of thrust bearing are calculated. A model based on typical beam finite element method is established to calculate the dynamic response, {{and the effects of}} supporting conditions such as elastic oil tank support, different heights of the thrust pads with rigid support are discussed. The results reveal that the influence of thrust bearing is small when the elastic oil tanks work normally. When the supporting conditions turn to be rigid due to the oil leakage, the differences of thrust pad heights have evident influence on the load distribution of the thrust pads; while the effects on the tilting stiffness of the thrust bearing and the amplitude of the lateral shaft vibration is small when the maximum load on thrust pads is smaller than the allowable value...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} planned {{alternatives}} {{for increasing the}} generation capacity of Hoover Dam to help meet peak power demands. These alternatives include: (a) uprating the existing generating units, (b) replacing or adding one or more generating units and (c) adding <b>reversible</b> pumped-storage <b>hydroelectric</b> units. Since the existing generators are {{at the end of}} their economic life and have to be replaced, their uprating has been scheduled as routine maintenance. This will increase the generating capacity of the Hoover Dam powerplant from 1240 MW to 1810 MW, but the anticipated capacity for meeting power demand is 2300 MW. Therefore, modifications (alternatives B and C) are also being considered to obtain an additional 500 MW from Hoover Dam. The proposed modification of Hoover Dam will alter the existing daily discharge regime, but because of water requirements downstream, the total volume of water discharged over an annual period will remain the same. To meet peak power demands with the proposed alternatives, the daily discharge cycle will be changed to longer periods of low flow (evening-early morning) and shorter periods of peak flow (midafternoon-dusk). The peak discharge rate will increase to 76, 000 ft 3. sec- 1 (Table l), but minimum flows of 2000 ft 3. sec- 1 will be maintained with alternatives A and B when the elevation of Lake Mohave is below 630 ft. Since the water of Lake Mohave extends to the tail race of Hoover Dam when lake elevations are greater than 630 ft., minimum flows of 2000 ft 3. sec- 1 will be unnecessary and hence zero discharge at night may occur. With reversible pumped-storage (alternative C), some of the water used for generating during peak power demands would also be pumped back to Lake Mead at night at a rate of up to 25, 000 ft 3. sec- 1. This will cause reverse flows in the river section, and could pull Lake Mohave water to the dam. Hoover Dam has two sets of intake gates located at elevation 1045 ft. and 900 ft. on the four intake towers. The upper gates (1045 ft.), with few exceptions, have not been used since 1954, but, with the addition of generating units (alternative B) or the installation of reversible pumped-storage units (alternative C), one upper gate on the Arizona Tower would be used in conjunction with the four lower gates to facilitate the higher flows. We have previously reported (Paulson, Baker and Deacon 1980) that the discharge temperature could increase and undergo daily fluctuation due to withdrawal of increasing amounts of warmer water form Lake Mead at higher peak discharge. The U. S. Water and Power Resources Service therefore initiated this investigation to determine to what extent discharge temperature from Hoover Dam and thermal stratification in Lake Mead would change with discharges under the following conditions: (i) all four intakes on the upper gates (ii) all four intakes on the lower gates, (iii) from a combined use of one upper gate and four lower gates...|$|R
