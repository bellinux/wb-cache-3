25|$|The {{idea that}} some {{languages}} {{are superior to}} others and that lesser languages maintained their speakers in intellectual poverty was widespread in the early 20th century. American linguist William Dwight Whitney, for example, actively strove to eradicate Native American languages, arguing that their speakers were savages and {{would be better off}} learning English and adopting a civilized way of life. The first anthropologist and linguist to challenge this view was Franz Boas. While undertaking geographical research in northern Canada he became fascinated with the Inuit people and decided to become an ethnographer. Boas stressed the equal worth of all cultures and languages, that {{there was no such thing}} as a primitive language and that all languages were capable of expressing the same content, albeit by widely differing means. Boas saw language as an inseparable part of culture and he was among the first to <b>require</b> <b>of</b> ethnographers to learn the native language of the culture under study and to document verbal culture such as myths and legends in the original language.|$|E
25|$|The Iranian {{government}} has repeatedly made compromise offers to place strict limits on {{its nuclear program}} beyond what the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Additional Protocol legally <b>require</b> <b>of</b> Iran, {{in order to ensure}} that the program cannot be secretly diverted to the manufacture of weapons. These offers include operating Iran's nuclear program as an international consortium, with the full participation of foreign governments. This offer by the Iranians matched a proposed solution put forth by an IAEA expert committee that was investigating the risk that civilian nuclear technologies could be used to make bombs. Iran has also offered to renounce plutonium extraction technology, thus ensuring that its heavy water reactor at Arak cannot be used to make bombs either. More recently, the Iranians have reportedly also offered to operate uranium centrifuges that automatically self-destruct if they are used to enrich uranium beyond what is required for civilian purposes. However, despite offers of nuclear cooperation by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany, Iran has refused to suspend its enrichment program as the Council has demanded. Iran's representative asserted that dealing with the issue in the Security Council was unwarranted and void of any legal basis or practical utility because its peaceful nuclear program posed no threat to international peace and security, and, that it ran counter to the views of the majority of United Nations Member States, which the Council was obliged to represent.|$|E

500|$|The {{claimant}} {{must first}} {{show that the}} defendant's actions have caused an interference with their use or enjoyment of the land. These interferences are indirect, and almost always the result of continuing events rather than a one-off incident. This interference may be a physical invasion of the land, such as in Davey v Harrow Corporation, noise, as in Christie v Davey, or smells, such as in Wheeler v J J Saunders. The courts have allowed cases where the interference causes emotional distress, as in Thompson-Schwab v Costaki, but have been loath to protect recreational facilities or [...] "things of delight"; things such as the blocking of a pleasant view or a television signal are not considered a nuisance. The latter was discussed in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, where the claimants argued that the blocking of their television signal by {{the construction of the}} skyscraper at One Canada Square was a nuisance. The House of Lords rejected this argument. There are rights to land known as servitudes, such as the right to light through windows or the right of support. An occupier can also be liable for an interference that is naturally arising, assuming they are aware of the interference's existence and fail to take reasonable precautions, as in Leakey v National Trust, which established that in such situations [...] "the standard ought to be to <b>require</b> <b>of</b> the occupier what is reasonable to expect of him in his individual circumstances". This principle was extended in Holbeck Hall Hotel v Scarborough Borough Council, where the Court of Appeal said that if a landowner knows or ought to know that their property may cease to support another's, they are required to take reasonable precautions or they will be liable.|$|E

Romney's spokeswoman said he could not sign the pledge because it could have unforeseen deleterious consequences. Romney himself wrote that, [...] "It is one thing to end federal funding for an organization like Planned Parenthood; it is entirely another to end all federal funding for thousands of hospitals across America.... That is precisely what the pledge would demand and <b>require</b> <b>of</b> a president who signed it." [...] He promised that nonetheless he would support pro-life legislation should it come before him as president, such as a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban abortions after 20weeks of pregnancy.|$|E

[...] But Rabbi Nehemiah explained that it was because “they are one people, and they have all one language,” that they rebelled against God.

2500|$|C's and Unidos Podemos leaders Albert Rivera and Pablo Iglesias met Rajoy on 12 July {{as part of}} {{the interim}} Prime Minister's ongoing round of talks. Rivera left a window open to abstaining in Rajoy's investiture—now {{scheduled}} for late July–early August—asking nothing in return, as an attempt to pressure the PSOE into doing likewise and allowing for a government to be formed. This would mean a change in the party's main election pledge not to allow Rajoy to remain in office. The PP praised the [...] "constructive" [...] tone and [...] "good climate" [...] of the meeting. The next day, C's confirmed its change of position and announced it would vote against Rajoy {{in the first round of}} investiture, but that it would abstain in the second round in which Rajoy would only <b>require</b> <b>of</b> a simple majority to be elected. On the other hand, Iglesias noted Rajoy on Podemos' political project incompatibility with PP's and that he should expect nothing but Unidos Podemos' frontal opposition to his investiture. In the subsequent press conference, Iglesias took the opportunity to urge Sánchez to take the initiative and try to form an alternative government himself with his support, claiming that PSOE had to choose between Rajoy, a leftist alternative or a new election.|$|E
