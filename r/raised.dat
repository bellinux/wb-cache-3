40|$|AbstractThe factory <b>raising</b> {{seedlings}} is {{a large-scale}} concentrated <b>raising</b> seedlings method, {{which is often}} used to develop seedlings of rice, vegetable and flowers. The technology and application of factory <b>raising</b> seedlings were introduced in this paper. Three kinds of <b>raising</b> seedlings modes, which have been put in use in China, are small <b>raising</b> seedlings greenhouse, intelligent <b>raising</b> seedlings greenhouse and factory <b>raising</b> seedlings respectively. The disadvantages are that, they belong to tray <b>raising</b> seedlings mode which needs large fields and trays, and the labor intensity is too hard. In order to reduce the area and <b>raise</b> the level of <b>raising</b> seedlings mechanization, a kind of rice factory three-dimensional <b>raising</b> seedlings system was presented, which is consisted of greenhouse, seedlings frame, carpet seeder and so on. A new carpet <b>raising</b> seedlings was also put forward and can produce long seedlings carpet that is twice as wide as seedlings tray at least. And a carpet seeder designed can flat the nutritional tape into seedlings frame and put seeds and topsoil on the tape. Integrating with multiple stratifications, carpet <b>raising</b> seedlings and intelligent control technology, the factory three-dimensional carpet <b>raising</b> seedlings system provides technical support for the seedlings industrialization development in future...|$|R

5|$|Friedrich der Grosse was {{the first}} ship of the fleet to be scuttled, sinking at 12:16. She was <b>raised</b> on 29 April 1937 and towed to Rosyth for scrapping.

The ship was later <b>raised</b> on 31 July 1935 and broken up in Rosyth over the following year. Kaiser sank at 13:25, and was <b>raised</b> for scrapping on 20 March 1929; breaking work was conducted in Rosyth by 1930. Prinzregent Luitpold sank five minutes later, at 13:30.

5000|$|Also in no-limit and pot-limit games, a <b>raise</b> may be {{expressed}} {{as either a}} <b>raise</b> by $X or a <b>raise</b> to $X. For example, suppose Alice opens by betting $5. If Dianne subsequently announces [...] "I <b>raise</b> by $15" [...] she will be <b>raising</b> by $15 {{over and above the}} opening bet of $5, for a total bet of $20. On the other hand, if Dianne subsequently announces [...] "I <b>raise</b> to $15" [...] she will be <b>raising</b> by only $10 for a total bet of $15. Today, most public cardrooms prefer for players to use the <b>raise</b> to standard as opposed to the <b>raise</b> by standard. In the event of any ambiguity in a player's verbal action while <b>raising,</b> the player will normally be bound to <b>raise</b> to the stated amount. For example, if Alice were to have opened with a $5 bet and Dianne subsequently announced [...] "raise, $15" [...] while putting $20 into pot, in most public cardrooms Dianne would be bound to a total bet of $15 and the [...] "excess" [...] $5 would be returned to her.|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} role of salary <b>raises</b> and the {{perception}} of employees of these salary <b>raises</b> on employees' intended retention and turnover. By using a unique survey data set from an American university, this study investigates a novel hypothesis that faculty perceptions of salary <b>raises,</b> relative to their perceptions of other faculty members' assessments of the <b>raises,</b> influences their labor supply. Using both Ordered Probit and OLS modelling frameworks, we focus on the impact of salary <b>raises</b> and the relative perception of these <b>raises</b> on intended labor supply behavior. We explore a hypothesis that a mismatch between one's ranking of the salary <b>raise</b> {{and the perception of}} others' rankings causes dissatisfaction. Our results provide evidence that salary <b>raises</b> themselves are effective monetary tools to reduce turnover; however, our results also suggest that relative deprivation as a comparison of one's own perceptions of a salary <b>raise</b> with others affects employee retention. We find that employees who have less favorable perceptions of salary adjustments, compared to what they believe their colleagues think, are more likely to seek another employer, holding their own perception of <b>raises</b> constant. Conversely, more favorable views of salary <b>raises,</b> compared to how faculty members think other's perceived the salary <b>raises,</b> does not have a statistically significant impact on retention. Our results indicate that monetary rewards in the form of salary <b>raises</b> do impact employee retention; however, perception of fairness of these salary <b>raises</b> is also as important as the actual <b>raises.</b> Given the high cost of job turnover, these findings suggest that employers would benefit from devoting resources toward ensuring that salary- and raise-determining procedures are generally perceived by the vast majority of employees as being fair. This is the first study that explores the employee satisfaction with salary <b>raises</b> relative to perceptions of other employees' satisfaction with salary <b>raises,</b> and intended labor supply in an American university...|$|R

50|$|In {{the game}} of poker, a betting round {{is said to be}} closed if no player will have the right to <b>raise</b> in the round.

The round can also said to be closed before it has {{actually}} ended if there are still players remaining to act, but they will not be entitled to <b>raise</b> either because the last <b>raise</b> was a sub-minimum all-in <b>raise</b> (see poker table stakes rules) or because the limit ("cap") on allowed <b>raises</b> has been reached.|$|R
