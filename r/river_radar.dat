The grid-scale can be large, particularly for GCMs, and disaggregation is required, for example to generate appropriate spatial-temporal properties of rainfall for coupling with surface-boundary conditions or more general hydrological applications. A method is presented here which considers the generation of the wet areas and the simulation of rainfall intensities separately. For the first task, a nearest-neighbour Markov scheme, based upon a Bayesian technique used in image processing, is implemented so as to preserve the structural features of the observed rainfall. Essentially, the large-scale field and the previously disaggregated field are used as evidence in an iterative procedure which aims at selecting a realisation according to the joint posterior probability distribution. In the second task the morphological characteristics of the field of rainfall intensities are reproduced through a random sampling of intensities according to a beta distribution and their allocation to pixels chosen so that the higher intensities {{are more likely to be}} further from the dry areas.

40|$|Optimal spatial {{assessment}} of short-time step precipitation for hydrological modelling {{is still an}} important research question considering the poor observation networks for high time resolution data. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to present a new approach for rainfall observation. The idea is to consider motorcars as moving rain gauges with windscreen wipers as sensors to detect precipitation. This idea is easily technically feasible if the cars are provided with GPS and a small memory chip for recording the coordinates, car speed and wiper frequency. This study explores theoretically the benefits of such an approach. For that a valid relationship between wiper speed and rainfall rate considering uncertainty was assumed here. A simple traffic model is applied to generate motorcars on roads in a <b>river</b> basin. <b>Radar</b> data are used as reference rainfall fields. Rainfall from these fields is sampled with a conventional rain gauge network and with several dynamic networks consisting of moving motorcars, using different assumptions such as accuracy levels for measurements and sensor equipment rates for the car networks. Those observed point rainfall data from the different networks are then used to calculate areal rainfall for different scales. Ordinary kriging and indicator kriging are applied for interpolation of the point data with the latter considering uncertain rainfall observation by cars e. g. according to a discrete number of windscreen wiper operation classes. The results are compared with the values from the radar observations. The study is carried out for the 3300 km 2 Bode river basin located in the Harz Mountains in Northern Germany. The results show, that the idea is theoretically feasible and motivate practical experiments. Only a small portion of the cars needed to be equipped with sensors for sufficient areal rainfall estimation. Regarding the required sensitivity of the potential rain sensors in cars it could be shown, that often a few classes for rainfall observation are enough for satisfactory areal rainfall estimation.

Time-averaged <b>radar</b> images captured fronts extending offshore from the river’s mouth as bright streaks. Comparisons between satellite optical images and radar images confirm that streaky features in the radar image represent color river plume fronts. Further corroboration comes from field observations of water temperature, salinity, and turbidity conducted simultaneously with the radar measurements. When a survey ship crossed the front, the measured properties varied discontinuously, suggesting that water from the river and sea converged there and also that a downwards current was present. Variation of visibility of the fronts was assessed and compared with the rate of variation of water level and the wind speed and direction. The radar is able to image fronts when the water level is decreasing during ebb tide and the wind speed is over 3 [*]m/s along shore. Surface ripple waves are generated by the local wind, and if they propagate across the front, wave heights increase, causing higher backscatter of the emitted radar beam.

Geographical Information System (GIS) was used for the evaluation of linear, areal and relief aspects of morphometric parameters. The study reveals that the terrain exhibits dentritic and trellis pattern of drainage. The Chalakudi River Basin has a total area of 1, 448.73  km 2 and is designated as seventh-order basin. The drainage density of the basin is estimated as 2.54 and the lower-order streams mostly dominate the basin. The high basin relief indicates high runoff and sediment transport. The elongation ratio of the Chalakudi Basin is estimated as 0.48 and indicates that the shape of the basin is elongated. The development of stream segments in the basin area is more or less effected by rainfall. Relief ratio indicates that the discharge capability of watershed is very high and the groundwater potential is meagre. The low value of drainage density in spite of mountainous relief indicates that the area is covered by dense vegetation and resistant rocks permeated by fractures and joints. These studies are helpful in watershed development planning and wise utilization of natural resources.|$|R

The existing methods for detecting rivers are typically based on rivers&#x 2019; edges, which are easily mixed with those of artificial buildings or farmland.

Inspired by the feature integration and target recognition capabilities of biological vision systems, in this paper, we present a hierarchical method for automated {{detection of}} river networks in the high-resolution SAR data using biologically visual saliency modeling. For effective saliency detection, the original image is first over-segmented into a set of primitive superpixels.

Afterwards, three saliency measurements based on the specificity of the rivers in the SAR images are proposed to generate a single layer saliency map, i. e., Local Region Contrast (LRC), Boundary Connectivity (BC) and Edge Density (ED). Finally, by exploiting belief propagation, we propose a multi-layer saliency fusion approach to derive a high-quality saliency map.

This study combines remote sensing techniques and field measurements {{to evaluate the}} applica-bility of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to defining spring breakup of the braided lower Kuparuk River, North Slope, Alaska. A statistical analysis was carried out on a time series (2001 – 10) of SAR images acquired from the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS- 2) and the Canadian RADARSAT satellite, {{as well as on}} measured runoff. On the basis of field information, the SAR images were separated into pre-breakup, breakup, and post-breakup periods. Three variables were analyzed for their suitability to bracket the river breakup period: image brightness, variance in brightness over the river length, and a sum of rank order change analysis. Variance in brightness was found to be the most reliable indicator. A combined use of that variance and sum of rank order change appeared promising when enough images were available. The temporal resolution of imagery served as the major limitation in constraining the timing of the hydrologic event. Challenges associated with spring runoff monitoring and the sensitive nature of SAR likely resulted in an earlier detection of surficial changes by the remote sensing technique compared to the field runoff observations. Given a sufficient temporal resolution, SAR imagery has the potential to improve the spatiotemporal monitoring of Arctic watersheds for river breakup investigations.

Around the world, especially in the developing regions, many large river basins are mostly ungauged. For these basins river model setup is very challenging due to lack of necessary in-situ and routine measurement of river bathymetry, flood plain and river boundary data. Moreover, lack of data sharing among the countries occupying the trans-boundary rivers, also a hurdle to river model development. For such basins, proxy approaches depending on the satellite based remotely sensed data could be an alternative solution. In this study, one dimensional hydrodynamic model has been developed for the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna basin region using the Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS). Only 7 % of the total basin area has good quality in-situ measurement of river hydraulics. For the remaining part, remotely sensed data have been utilized for river model development.

This paper shows that many of the assessment indicators proposed by the RHF can be already derived by different RS sources and existing methodologies, and that EU countries have sufficient RS data at present to already begin their incorporation into hydromorphology assessment and monitoring, as mandated by WFD, which so far have been insufficiently addressed by the member states due to the demanding efforts it would require. With cooperation and planning, RS data can form a fundamental component of hydromorphological assessment and monitoring in the future to help support the effective and sustainable management of rivers, and this would be done most effectively through the establishment of multi-purpose RS acquisition campaigns and the development of shared and standardized hydromorphological RS databases updated regularly through planned resurveyed campaigns.

It is shown that altimetric measurements can be combined with a single in-situ gauge to derive a reliable stage-discharge relationship upstream from the gauge. The Caqueta River in the Colombian Amazon Basin was selected to simulate a poorly monitored basin. Thus it was possible to derive the stage-discharge relationship for 13 "virtual gauge stations'' defined at <b>river</b> crossing with <b>radar</b> altimetric ground tracks. Stage measurements are derived from altimetric data following the methodology developed by Leon et al. (2006). Discharge is modeled using PROGUM – a flow routing model based on the Muskingum Cunge (M-C) approach considering a diffusion-cum-dynamic wave propagation (Leon et al., 2006) using a single gauge located downstream from the basin under study. Rating curve parameters at virtual stations are estimated by fitting with a power law the temporal series of water surface altitude derived from satellite measurements and the modelled discharges. The methodology allows the ellipsoidal height of effective zero flow to be estimated. This parameter is a good proxy of the mean water depth from which the bottom slope of the reaches can be computed. Validation has been conducted by comparing the results with stages and discharges measured at five other gauges available on the Caqueta basin. Outflow errors range from 10 % to 20 % between the upper basin and the lower basin, respectively. Mean absolute differences less than 1. 10 m between estimated equivalent water depth and measured water depth indicates the reliability of the proposed method. Finally, a 1. 2 × 10 - 4 mm - 1 mean bottom slope has been obtained for the 730 km long reach of the Caqueta main stream considered...|$|R
40|$|The summary and {{conclusions}} are that overall the radar and seismic results were excellent. At {{the time of}} design of the experiments {{we did not know}} how well these two methods could penetrate or resolve the moisture content and structure. It appears that the radar could easily go up to 5, even 10 meters between boreholes at 200 Mhz and even father (up to 20 to 40 m) at 50 Mhz. The seismic results indicate that at several hundred hertz propagation of 20 to 30 meters giving high resolution is possible. One of the most important results, however is that together the seismic and radar are complementary in their properties estimation. The radar being primarily sensitive to changes in moisture content, and the seismic being primarily sensitive to porosity. Taken in a time lapse sense the radar can show the moisture content changes to a high resolution, with the seismic showing high resolution lithology. The significant results for each method are: Radar: (1) Delineated geological layers 0. 25 to 3. 5 meters thick with 0. 25 m resolution; (2) Delineated moisture movement and content with 0. 25 m resolution; (3) Compared favorably with neutron probe measurements; and (4) Penetration up to 30 m. Radar results indicate that the transport of the riverwater is {{different from that of the}} heavier and more viscous sodium thiosulfate. It appears that the heavier fluids are not mixing readily with the in-situ fluids and the transport may be influenced by them. Seismic: (1) Delineated lithology at. 25 m resolution; (2) Penetration over 20 meters, with a possibility of up to 30 or more meters; and (3) Maps porosity and density differences of the sediments. Overall the seismic is mapping the porosity and density distribution. The results are consistent with the flow field mapped by the radar, there is a change in flow properties at the 10 to 11 meter depth in the flow cell. There also appears to be break through by looking at the radar data with the denser sodium thiosulfate finally penetrating the barrier, but not the <b>river</b> water. The <b>radar</b> and seismic data imply that the fluid property differences (density, viscosity, surface tension) between the river water and the sodium thiosulfate do make a difference in flow characteristics...|$|R
