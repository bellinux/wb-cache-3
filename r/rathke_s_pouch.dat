40|$|The {{frequency}} of defecation, leakage, maximum resting pressure, and maximum squeeze {{pressure of the}} anal canal, maximum tolerated volume, and pouch compliance were evaluated in 116 consecutive patients following total proctocolectomy (TPC) with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) and after temporary ileostomy closure. Sixty-nine patients had a double ileal loop pouch ("J") and 47 a triple ("S") design. Seventy patients had mucosal proctectomy and hand-sewn IPAA (mucosectomy) and 46 a stapled IPAA without mucosal proctectomy (stapled). Fifty percent of the S and 30 % of the J pouch patients did not have nocturnal defecations. The avoidance of anal manipulation in the stapled group resulted in higher anal canal resting pressures and a lower incidence of leakage. The maximum tolerated volume and compliance was greater in the <b>S</b> <b>pouch</b> group than in the J group. Although the median {{frequency of}} defecation was equal in both <b>pouch</b> groups, fewer <b>S</b> <b>pouch</b> patients had nocturnal defecations.

40|$|The {{popularity}} of the endorectal pullthrough {{for the treatment of}} benign mucosal diseases of the rectum has created a controversy regarding the need for a reservoir. The four currently advocated procedures, the straight endorectal anastomosis, the J <b>pouch,</b> the <b>S</b> <b>pouch,</b> and the lateral isoperistaltic ileal reservoir were evaluated in a puppy model with four animals in each experimental group. Measurement of rectal capacitance showed that all groups achieved 80 - 85 % of control values at 6 months after surgery. Intestinal transit time decreased by one-half in all groups. Stool consistency, stool culture, water, and electrolyte absorption did not show any statistical superiority of one group over another. Stool frequency varied widely at 6 months; 10 stools per 8 -hour period were counted in the lateral reservoir group versus 25 with the J pouches, and 16 with the straight and S groups. Stool frequency did not correlate with transit time, stool consistency, or rectal capacitance. Barium enemas showed that straight pullthroughs more closely resembled the measurements of the normal animal's endorectal canal.

During the same time, an additional four patients required a standard ileonal procedure. The results of anal manometry and clinical function {{were compared to}} 25 patients who had previously undergone mucosal stripping and a sutured J pouch ileoanal anastomoses with a temporary diverting ileostomy between October 1982 and August 1990. During this same time period, an additional 19 patients underwent an anti-peristaltic reversed J pouch and 18 an <b>S</b> <b>pouch,</b> {{for a total of}} 83 ileoanal procedures. The reversed J pouch had a lower stool frequency than a standard J pouch but had an unacceptable incidence of complications and problems with <b>pouch</b> emptying. The <b>S</b> <b>pouch</b> had a stool frequency similar to the standard J pouch but provided greater length in patients with a short mesentery. Stapled J pouch ileoanal patients had a better (p less than 0. 02) maximum and sphincter resting pressure (46 +/- 11 versus 34 +/- 12 mmHg), fewer (p less than 0. 05) night-time accidents (22 % versus 68 %), daytime (17 % versus 55 %) or night-time (28 versus 61 %) spotting, or use of a protective pad at night (11 % versus 42 %) than nonstapled J pouch ileoanal patients. Stool frequency was similar in the two groups. All but one UC patient had residual disease at the anastomosis. Anal mucosa between the dentate line and stapled anastomosis was 1. 8 +/- 1. 3 cm (range, 0 to 3. 5 cm). Complications in the nonstapled J pouch group included 4 pouches excised (2 for complications, 2 for excessive stool frequency), 1 pelvic abscess, 2 stenosis requiring dilation under anesthesia, 1 enterocutaneous fistula after ileostomy closure, 1 ileostomy site hernia, and 2 small bowel obstructions. Of the 65 patients who underwent ileostomy closure in the entire series, 8 (12 %) developed a complication requiring surgical intervention. Complications in the stapled group included 1 anastomotic leak, 1 pouch leak, and 1 pelvic abscess. Patients were managed successfully with drainage (all 3) and diverting ileostomy (1). One patient developed stenosis requiring dilation under anesthesia. The stapled J pouch ileoanal anastomosis is a simpler, safer procedure with less tension than a standard handsewn J pouch but leaves a very small cuff of residual disease.

40|$|Background: Marsupials {{such as the}} tammar wallaby (M.

Morphologically the lungs of tammar pouch young are immature at birth {{and the majority of}} their development occurs during the first 100 days of lactation. Results: In this study mouse embryonic lungs (E- 12) were cultured in media with tammar skim milk collected at key time points of lactation to identify factors involved in regulating postnatal lung maturation. Remarkably the embryonic lungs showed increased branching morphogenesis and this effect was restricted to milk collected at specific time points between approximately day 40 to 100 lactation. Further analysis to assess lung development showed {{a significant increase in the}} expression of marker genes Sp-C, Sp-B, Wnt- 7 b, BMP 4 and Id 2 in lung cultures incubated with milk collected at day 60. Similarly, day 60 milk specifically stimulated proliferation and elongation of lung mesenchymal cells that invaded matrigel. In addition, this milk stimulated proliferation of lung epithelium cells on matrigel, and the cells formed 3 -dimensional acini with an extended lumen. Conclusions: This study has clearly demonstrated that tammar wallaby milk collected at specific times in early lactation contains bioactives that may have a significant role in lung maturation of pouch young...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we have {{evaluated}} {{the role of}} specific chemotactic cytokines in leukocyte recruitment to s. c. tissue in response to TNF-alpha in vivo. Injection of TNF-alpha into <b>s.</b> c. air <b>pouches</b> led to a rapid, transient accumulation of leukocytes. Maximal accumulation of leukocytes in the air pouch was observed at between 2 and 4 h after injection of TNF-alpha. The cellular exudate comprised predominantly neutrophils, with smaller numbers of eosinophils and mononuclear phagocytes also being recruited. However, lymphocyte recruitment was not observed. TNF-alpha injection induced a time-dependent increase in the levels of immunoreactive macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 2, MIP- 1 alpha, and JE in the pouch exudate as well as increased steady-state mRNA levels of KC, MIP- 2, MIP- 1 alpha, and JE in the tissue lining the <b>s.</b> c. <b>pouch</b> and of MIP- 2, MIP- 1 alpha, and JE in the exudate cell population. Passive immunization with specific Abs directed against each of these chemokines significantly inhibited the accumulation of neutrophils, mononuclear phagocytes, and eosinophils in response to TNF-alpha. Taken together, these data demonstrate {{the existence of a}} chemokine network in vivo involving at least four individual chemokines that regulates recruitment of the major peripheral blood granulocytes and mononuclear phagocytes to s. c. sites during acute inflammation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{retrospective}} {{review was}} performed to determine the results after surgical reconstruction for chronic dysfunction of ileal pouch-anal procedures for ulcerative colitis and familial colonic polyposis at a university medical center. METHODS: During the 20 -year period from 1978 to 1998, 601 patients underwent colectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis, familial colonic polyposis, or Hirschsprung's disease. A J pouch was used for 351 patients, a lateral pouch for 221, an <b>S</b> <b>pouch</b> for 6, and a straight pull-through for 23. Acute complications after pouch construction have been detailed in previous publications and {{are not included in}} this study. Chronic pouch stasis with diarrhea, frequency, urgency, and soiling gradually became more severe in 164 patients (27. 3 %), associated with pouch enlargement, an elongated efferent limb, and obstruction to pouch outflow, largely related to the pouch configuration used during the authors' early clinical experience. These patients were sufficiently symptomatic to be considered for reconstruction (mean 68 months after IPAA). Transanal resection of an elongated IPAA spout was performed on 58 patients; abdominoperineal mobilization of the pouch with resection and tapering of the lower end (AP reconstruction) and ileoanal anastomosis on 83; pouch removal and new pouch construction on 7; and conversion of a straight pull-through to a pouch on 16. RESULTS: Good long-term results (mean 7. 7 years) with improvement in symptoms occurred in 98 % of transanal resections, 91. 5 % of AP reconstructions, 86 % of new pouch constructions, and 100 % of conversions of a straight pull-through to a pouch. The average number of bowel movements per 24 hours at 6 months was 4. 8. Complications occurred in 11. 6 % of reconstructed patients. Five of the 164 patients (3. 1 %) required eventual pouch removal and permanent ileostomy. The high rate of pouch revision in this series of patients undergoing IPAA is due to a policy of aggressive correction when patients do not experience an optimal functional result, or have a progressive worsening of their status. CONCLUSIONS: Although occasionally a major undertaking, reconstruction of ileoanal pouches with progressive dysfunction due to large size or a long efferent limb has resulted in marked improvement in intestinal function in > 93 % of patients and has reduced the need for late pouch removal...|$|R
40|$|Superantigens such as staphylococcal {{enterotoxin}} A and B (SEA and SEB) activate {{the immune system}} by stimulating {{a large proportion of}} T lymphocytes through specific Vbeta regions of the TCR and activating macrophages by binding to MHC class II molecules. While the mechanisms by which superantigens activate T lymphocytes have been elucidated, their role in the generation of local immune responses to bacterial invasion is still unclear. In this study we have examined the ability of the superantigens SEA and SEB to elicit an inflammatory reaction in vivo, in <b>s.</b> c. air <b>pouches</b> in the mouse. Upon injection into the <b>s.</b> c. air <b>pouch,</b> the two superantigens stimulated a time-dependent {{increase in the number of}} leukocytes appearing in the pouch exudate. The leukocytes migrating into the pouch exudate were predominantly neutrophils, with some mononuclear phagocytes and eosinophils present. No T lymphocytes were detected either in the pouch lining tissue or in the exudate cells. Injection of SEA resulted in increased ICAM- 1 expression, as detected by immunohistochemistry, on endothelial cells in the tissue surrounding the air pouch and accumulation of TNF-alpha and the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 (MIP- 2), MIP- 1 alpha, and JE in the pouch exudate. In addition, pretreatment of mice with Abs raised against ICAM- 1, TNF-alpha, MIP- 2, MIP- 1 alpha, KC, or JE inhibited leukocyte accumulation induced by SEA.

40|$|Pitx {{homeodomain}} proteins {{are highly}} conserved regulatory proteins that were first discovered {{on the basis}} of their involvement in the transcriptional regulation of pituitary-specific genes. Recently, a third member of Pitx family, Pitx 3, has been identified which expresses in the midbrain and eye. The main focus of this study was to elucidate the role of Xenopus Pitx 3 during eye development. As a side project, we also studied the role of this gene in the left-right patterning and axis formation in Xenopus. Here, we report the cloning of a Xenopus homolog which encodes a conceptual protein of 292 amino acids and shows a high similarity in amino acid level to human and murine Pitx 3. Early neurula expression is restricted to lateral prechordal mesoderm, anterior paraxial mesoderm, a crescent of anterior sensorial ectoderm, and a discrete spot which is fated to form Rathke 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>pouch.</b> xPitx 3 is expressed throughout lens induction in the presumptive lens ectoderm, lens placode, and later in differentiating lens. During tailbud stages, xPitx 3 is also expressed symmetrically in the pituitary, lateral plate mesoderm, branchial arches, somites, and asymmetrically in looping gut. Ectopic expression assays suggest that xPitx 3 directs development of the optic placode, and that without its influence; both the lens and retina fail to form. xPitx 3 over-expression expands the early expression domains of Pax 6 and Six 3 and alters development of the lens, optic vesicle, optic nerve, and diencephalon. Expression of a xPitx 3 /engrailed repressor chimera alters early expression domains of Pax 6, Rx, and Six 3, and later inhibits lens development consequently abrogating retinal induction. This later inhibition of eye development is reflected by diminished expression of Pax 6, Six 3, Rx, betaB 1 -crystallin, Otx 2, and Lens 1. Similar effects are obtained using antisense morpholino oligonucleotide-mediated translation knockdown. Reciprocal grafting experiments using wildtype and morpholino treated tissues demonstrate that xPitx 3 in the presumptive lens ectoderm is required for both lens and retina formation. Ectopic expression of xPitx 3 results in cyclopia which is indicative of the midline defects. Consistent with this result, overexpression of xPitx 3 or mutant constructs leads to profound visceral situs anomalies, suggesting that xPitx 3 may be involved in midline specification. Lastly, our results indicate that xPitx 3 may also play a role in somitogenesis through modulating Hox- 1 A and hairy 2 genes that are involved in spatiotemporal specification of developing somites.

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} enterocystometry, voiding pattern and urine leakage of four types of orthotopic bladder substitute. Material and methods. At eight urological departments, 78 consecutive men were studied: 66 with an ileal neobladder [30 Studer <b>pouches</b> (<b>S),</b> 24 Hautmann <b>pouches</b> (H) and 12 T-pouches (T) ] and 12 with a right colonic [Goldwasser type (G) ] neobladder. Enterocystometry, determination of residual urine, micturition protocol and 24 h pad weight test were performed 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Results. Colonic neobladders had higher pouch pressure at first desire, normal desire and strong desire than ileal neobladders (except at first and normal desire at 12 months) (p < 0. 02) and contraction was present more often at both 6 and 12 months (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 01). Compliance was good in all types of pouch. Intermittent self-catheterization was more common in H patients at 6 months (p = 0. 033). All patients with colonic neobladders used pads during the day and night. In patients with ileal pouches 32 % used pads during the day and 70 % during the night at 12 months. Urine leakage was higher in patients with colonic bladders at 6 and 12 months during the day (mean/median of 98 / 31 ml and 82 / 16 ml versus 10 / 0 ml and 4 / 0 ml, p < 0. 001). T-pouches had excellent day-time continence, but nocturnal leakage was high. Conclusions. The Hautmann pouch and the Studer pouch behaved similarly at enterocystometry and clinically, and continence was good in the majority of patients.

40|$|In this study, we have {{examined}} the ability of chemokine receptor antagonists to prevent neutrophil extravasation in the mouse. Two murine CXC chemokines, macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP) - 2 and KC, stimulated the accumulation of leukocytes into <b>s.</b> c. air <b>pouches,</b> although MIP- 2 was considerably more potent. The leukocyte infiltrate was almost exclusively neutrophilic in nature. A human CXC chemokine antagonist, growth-related oncogene (GRO) -alpha(8 - 73), inhibited calcium mobilization induced by MIP- 2, but not by platelet-activating factor in leukocytes isolated from the bone marrow, indicating that this antagonist inhibits MIP- 2 activity toward murine leukocytes. Pretreatment of mice with GROalpha(8 - 73) inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the MIP- 2 -induced influx of neutrophils to levels that {{were not significantly different}} from control values. Moreover, this antagonist was also effective in inhibiting the leukocyte recruitment induced by TNF-alpha, LPS, and IL- 1 beta. Leukocyte infiltration into the peritoneal cavity in response to MIP- 2 was also inhibited by prior treatment of mice with GROalpha(8 - 73) or the analogue of platelet factor 4, PF 4 (9 - 70). The results of this study indicate 1) that the murine receptor for MIP- 2 and KC, muCXCR 2, {{plays a major role in}} neutrophil recruitment to s. c. tissue and the peritoneal cavity in response to proinflammatory agents and 2) that CXCR 2 receptor antagonists prevent acute inflammation in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2001 by The American Association of ImmunologistsMembers of the {{chemokine}} gene superfamily {{are known}} to {{play a central role}} in leukocyte extravasation; however, their involvement in acute inflammation in response to micro-organisms has not yet been well studied. We have therefore investigated the role of murine macrophage-inflammatory protein (muMIP) 1 and muMIP- 2 in the inflammatory response mounted against the bacteria Salmonella enteritidis and the Sacchromyces cerevisiae cell wall component, zymosan. Leukocyte extravasation was monitored in murine <b>s.</b> c. air <b>pouches.</b> Both agonists induced accumulation of leukocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with the response peaking after 4 h and declining thereafter. The inflammatory exudate comprised mainly neutrophils; however, an increase in eosinophil accumulation was also observed in response to zymosan. The production of both muMIP- 1 and muMIP- 2 increased with time in response to both the agonists, although production was more sustained in response to the bacteria. Prior treatment of mice with neutralizing Abs against muMIP- 1 or muMIP- 2, either alone or in combination, failed to attenuate the accumulation of leukocytes in response to the agonists. In contrast, the anti-muMIP- 2 Abs significantly inhibited leukocyte recruitment in response to S. enteritidis in complement-deficient mice. Taken together, these data show that while muMIP- 1 and muMIP- 2 are produced in response to phagocytosis of micro-organisms in s. c. tissue, under these circumstances components of the complement pathway appear to play a dominant role in the recruitment of neutrophils.

Only when such tertiary tissues {{are subjected to}} chronic inflam-mation, such as in some (but not all) autoimmune diseases, are naive T cells recruited to these sites. We show that the CCR 7 ligand CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 21 is sufficient for attracting naive T cells into tertiary organs. We performed intravital microscopy of cremaster muscle venules in T-GFP mice, in which naive T cells express green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP cells underwent selectin-dependent rolling, but no firm adherence (sticking). Superfusion with CCL 21, but not CXC chemokine ligand 12, induced integrin-dependent sticking of GFP cells. Moreover, CCL 21 rapidly elicited accumulation of naive T cells into sterile <b>s.</b> c. air <b>pouches.</b> Interestingly, a second CCR 7 ligand, CCL 19, triggered T cell sticking in cremaster muscle venules, but failed to induce extravasation in air pouches. Immunohistochemistry studies implicate ectopic expression of CCL 21 as a mechanism for naive T cell traffic in human autoimmune diseases. Most blood vessels in tissue samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (85 10 %) and ulcerative colitis (66 1 %) expressed CCL 21, and many perivascular CD 45 RA naive T cells were found in these tissues, but not in psoriasis, where CCL 21 vessels were rare (17 1 %).

40|$|Surgical {{treatment}} is often needed {{for patients with}} ulcerative colitis because of toxic dilation, intractability or risk of cancer. Precise diagnosis is vital to exclude Crohn's disease and infective colitis, although patients with `indeterminate' colitis often do well after reconstructive surgery. Restorative proctocolectomy, in which the anal sphincter is preserved and a pelvic ileal reservoir {{is used as a}} substitute for the rectum, is the standard surgical procedure, supplanting panproctocolectomy with ileostomy. Ileorectal anastomosis should also be considered, but is only suitable for patients with relative rectal sparing, and meticulous sigmoidoscopic follow-up is essential. For toxic dilation, colectomy with ileostomy and mucous fistula is recommended, proctectomy and reconstruction being deferred until the patient is fitter. For most patients, the entire colon and rectum are removed and a pelvic ileal reservoir is anastomosed to the anus. Many types of reservoir have been proposed, but randomized trials are few, and it seems that the J pouch is as good as the <b>S</b> or W <b>pouches,</b> and technically is simpler. The operative mortality of restorative proctocolectomy worldwide has been about 1 %, thanks largely to the routine use of a temporary defunctioning ileostomy. A one-stage procedure without ileostomy is permissible if the patient is relatively fit and the surgeon is in attendance for 10 days after operation, but omission of the ileostomy certainly increases the risk to life and the postoperative morbidity, and should thus not be done in debilitated patients or in those on high dose steroids. Resection of the mucosal lining of the anal canal above the dentate line (`mucosal proctectomy') was formerly routine, but leads to diminished sphincter pressure and sensation, such that preservation of the entire motor and sensory sphincteric complex is now advocated by many authors. Omission of mucosal stripping renders the procedure technically simpler and quicker, and is associated with better sphincter function, with less fecal leakage. However, a small rim of inflamed mucosa may then be left above the anal transitional zone which theoretically could lead to risk of recurrent inflammation or even predispose to malignant change...|$|R
