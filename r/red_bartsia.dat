50|$|Odontites vernus, the <b>red</b> <b>bartsia,</b> is a wild flower {{from the}} figwort family native to Europe and Asia and {{occurring}} as an alien in North America. The <b>red</b> <b>bartsia</b> {{is a common}} plant in low-fertility soils, where it lives partially as a parasite on the roots of grasses. The <b>red</b> <b>bartsia</b> has pinkish and red flowers from June to September. They prefer dry conditions and full sun light exposure and are pollinated by bees and wasps. Over the last 70 years, the <b>red</b> <b>bartsia</b> has disappeared from many woodland locations in the English county of Dorset.|$|E
