40|$|Background: Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is a {{myeloproliferative}} disorder characterized by, overproduction of myeloid cells. Hydroxyurea is an antimetabolite which {{is commonly used}} in myeloproliferative syndromes. Reported skin changes related to hydroxyurea therapy may range form xerosis to mucocutaneous cancers. Aim: In this study, {{our aim was to}} understand and discuss the underlying reason for the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in patients <b>recieving</b> hydroxyurea and present a case, in whomwe operated to excise the tumoral masses and reconstruct them. Materials and Methods: After <b>recieving</b> hydroxyuea therapy for four years, the patient was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma on the upper lip and, on the dorsum of the left hand. She was operated and the tumoral masses were excised. The lesion on the upper lip was reconstructed with nasolabial flap, inner and inferior sides of the flap was skin grafted. The defect on the dorsum of the hand was skin grafted. Results: No complication related to operation occured. Throughout postoperative eight months of follow-up period, the patient had no complaint regarding the operation. Conclusıon: Skin lesions of patients <b>recieving</b> hydroxyurea therapy must be carefully examined and monitored regularly, since these lesions may proceed to skin cancers...|$|R

40|$|Background & aim: The {{therapeutic}} {{effects of}} traditional medicinal plants used in traditional medicine for many diseases have been proved. The {{present study was}} undertaken to investigate the effect of oral administration of different doses of hydroalcoholic extract of Nectaroscordum tripedale on biochemical factors. Method: Forty adult male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups of 8 animals as follows control group (<b>recieved</b> distilled water), control + 50 mg/kg Nectaroscordum tripedale, diabetic control group (<b>recieved</b> distilled water), treatment group 1 (<b>recieved</b> 50 mg/kg Nectaroscordum tripedale), treatment group 2 (<b>recieved</b> 100 mg/kg Nectaroscordum tripedales). The animals <b>recieved</b> Nectaroscordum tripedales extract by gavage for 21 days. Diabetes was induced by a single injection streptozotocin in rat (50 mg/kg b. w., ip). Before and 3 days after injection, 7, 14 and 21 days of treatment, the fasting glucose level and weight was measured. At the end of 21 days, blood samples collected from the heart puncture, after animals anesthetized with ether. The blood samples were analysed for lipid profile (total cholesterol, TG, HDL-c, LDL-c). Results: The {{results showed that the}} hydroalcoholic extract of Nectaroscordum tripedale could increase the average weight and decrease glucose in this period and also reduce cholesterol levels, triglyceride, and LDL-c dose dependent reduction at the end of 21 days (P < 0 / 05). The hydroalcoholic extract of Nectaroscordum tripedale showed an overall beneficial effect on serum lipid profiles and biochemical factors. Conclusion: Nectaroscordum tripedale may act as an antidiabetic agent by increasing either the pancreatic secretion of insulin from the pancreas or its release from bound insulin and increasing insulin and improving pancreatic function. Moreover, the antioxidant properties may reduce the hydroxy- 3 -methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase...|$|E

40|$|Background : Methanol usually {{used for}} organic solvent {{is a kind}} of alcohol that has the most simple {{structure}} but very toxic to human. Methanol intoxication can lead to acidosis metabolic, neurological complication, even death. Methanol and ethanol is metabolised mostly in liver and have potential to damage liver cell. There are lot of study about the effect of methanol and ethanol intoxication on liver cell but the study about the damage with microscopic analysis has not yet been found. This study aims to determine the histopathological effect of methanol and ethanol administration to liver cell damage in Wistar rat. Method : Experimental research with post test only controlled group design. Our sampel is 20 male Wistar rats that devided by one control and three treatment group. Treatment was gived through sonde with 6 ml/kg body weight per oral dose of methanol, 8 gr/kg body weight dose of taurine. K group not <b>recieved</b> any treatment. P 1 group <b>recieved</b> ethanol treatment. P 2 <b>recieved</b> methanol treatment. P 3 group <b>recieved</b> methanol and ethanol treatment. All the treatment is given for 14 days. After the treatment the rats was decapitated, autopsied the brain organ for preparation to make histopathology sampel. Result : Data result is analysed by One-way Annova test showed p= 0, 000. Continued by Post Hoc test showed that there is a significant differences between K-P 1 (p= 0, 002), K-P 2 (p= 0, 004), K-P 3 (p= 0, 000), P 1 -P 3 (p= 0, 029), P 2 -P 3 (p= 0, 021). Conslusion : Methanol and ethanol have almost same destruction effect in the liver cell but not significant. However if they gived simultaneously methanol and ethanol have synergistic effect that both compound increased more damage in liver cell significantly compare to other treatment group Keywords : methanol, ethanol, wistar ra...|$|E
