40|$|One of {{parameters}} {{which should}} be controlled and annually logged in the territories <b>radiation</b> <b>hygiene</b> passports is the total volume beta activity of the atmospheric air {{in the form of}} an average annual value in Bq/m 3 units. On different years in the territories <b>radiation</b> <b>hygiene</b> passports there were logged the data on the content of certain radionuclides; however the data on the atmospheric air total volume beta activity were the most informative in all the years. In majority of territories these data are obtained by the Federal Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring Service divisions, in some Russian Federation entities the measurements are carried out by Rospotrebnadzor bodies. However, in the recent years in most Russian Federation entities <b>radiation</b> <b>hygiene</b> passports there are entered design values of the air total volume beta activity, derived using the method of averaging the data on geographic areas. This article is an attempt to generalize the data on the air total volume beta activity in <b>radiation</b> <b>hygiene</b> passports of the Russian Federation entities, to assess long-term stability of this parameter and opportunity to establish numerical values which may be used as a reference at atmospheric air radiation hygienic monitoring. The article proves that at normal operation of radiation objects on the territory of some Russian Federation entities (excluding zones of large radiation objects supervision in these territories) the atmospheric air average annual total volume beta activity value is stable enough. It is determined that on some years the parameter average annual values in the territories of Saint-Petersburg, Krasnoyarsk region and Khanty-Mansi autonomous region – Yugra differ up to 50 % from the average levels derived by long-term observation. The atmospheric air average annual total volume beta activity numerical values assessment is obtained; these values may be accepted as reference levels at atmospheric air radiation hygienic monitoring. Possible reasons are analyzed of atmospheric air total volume beta activity level distinctions on the territory of considered Russian Federation entities.  </p...|$|E

40|$|By {{this time}} in the Russian Federation there is {{collected}} a huge file of data describing the influence of all natural sources of ionizing radiation on population in municipal conditions. These data are collected and generalized in <b>radiation</b> <b>hygiene</b> passports of the Russian Federation for the last 16 years and in the reporting forms of federal statistical supervision No 4 -DOZ “Data on doses of population irradiation due to the natural and manchanged radiation background” for a period of 14 years. These data are received by direct measurements of gamma radiation dose rate in the premises and in the open air on the territory of settlements. Measurements were made with the most different dosimeters; their technical and metrological parameters differ considerably. In this regard of certain interest is evaluation of this data reliability degree; that will help to find out the reasons of higher levels of the Russian Federation population external irradiation in comparison with average global dose values. In this article an attempt was made to evaluate reliability degree of data on the population external irradiation doses using the <b>radiation</b> <b>hygiene</b> passports of territories and reporting forms No 4 -DOZ for the whole period of supervision. For this there was used the known dependence between the gamma radiation dose rate and natural radionuclides effective specific activity (AEFF) in inhabitancy objects. For this purpose there were used the data on average AEFF values of building raw materials and of local manufacture materials, which are presented in <b>radiation</b> <b>hygiene</b> passports of territories. Definition of design value of gamma radiation dose rate in the buildings and in the open air according to AEFF measurement data in building raw materials and in local manufacture materials actually enables to get an independent evaluation of the population external irradiation doses. Comparison of two evaluations of the population external irradiation levels enabled to reveal certain territories on which the population external irradiation doses are obviously overestimated or underestimated. It is proved that the specified population external irradiation dose values for certain entities and for the whole country are much closer to corresponding evaluations by foreign experts and to the average global levels. </p...|$|E

The article describes the main results of the laboratory research of construction materials natural radioactivity and the subsequent substantiation of specifications on natural radionuclides content in them. There was parallel research of natural radionuclides transfer in the system “fertilizers→soil→plants” and further along the nutrition chain into the human body. In these works there were first obtained the quantitative data on coefficients of natural radionuclides transfer from fertilizers into agricultural plants, data on the natural radionuclides content in phosphate fertilizers of the main manufacturers, and the reference data on the natural radioactivity of arable soils. This research provided substantiation of a standard of natural radionuclides content in phosphate fertilizers. Important results were also received in a large-scale research of natural environment radioactivity and of technological processes of production, processing and use of mineral raw materials.

40|$|In 2016, St. Petersburg Research Institute of <b>Radiation</b> <b>Hygiene</b> after Professor P. V. Ramzaev celebrates 60 -th anniversary since its’ foundation. Mindful of the Institute as the {{research}} organization 60 years {{is not too}} much but it was exactly that time period which spanned radiation hygiene’s origination and development as science. The Institute was established only just 11 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, {{against the backdrop of}} nuclear weapons tests when the awareness of ionizing radiation’s disastrous consequences for population and environment was not just confined to a narrow circle of specialists. By that time the famous F- 1 reactor had already been in operation and new perspectives of nuclear energy peaceful use were lying ahead. There had been an urgent need for scientific studies on personnel and population safety, for development of research hardware, for special personnel in-service training etc. So the Institute’s creation was necessitated by life itself, by objectives unthinkable without a specialized scientific research organization. Since the very beginning, the Institute specialists mostly aimed at studying technogenic radiation sources. That was the very purpose of the Institute’s creation. Nevertheless almost simultaneously with that the Institute had initiated studies on natural  radioactivity. New devices had been created in order to identify natural and technogenic radionuclides at such levels which are hardly achievable even these days. It will be demonstrated below that some of the 1970 s and 1980 s hardware  developments retained their uniqueness. Mindful of the upcoming jubilee we consider it expedient to think back to the most outstanding scientists who had made a profound contribution into the establishment of the Institute as the contemporary scientific school of <b>radiation</b> <b>hygiene</b> and domestic hygienic science. This publication describes the infancy of the natural sources dosimetry laboratory. Subsequently it is planned to display the further advancement laboratory’s studies of natural radiation as one of population exposure major sources. </p...|$|E

The authors of this latest study found an interesting correlation between pH-values of the soil and radioactive contamination of the cover of grass. Integration of those data for calculation and simulation using the Ecomodel yielded satisfactory results in the modelling of long-time nuclide transfer used as an averaged value for a number of defined sites.
