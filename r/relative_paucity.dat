5|$|Ariel {{appears to}} be fairly evenly cratered {{compared}} to other moons of Uranus; the <b>relative</b> <b>paucity</b> of large craters suggests that its surface does not date to the Solar System's formation, which means that Ariel must have been completely resurfaced at some point of its history. Ariel's past geologic activity {{is believed to have}} been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently. The largest crater observed on Ariel, Yangoor, is only 78km across, and shows signs of subsequent deformation. All large craters on Ariel have flat floors and central peaks, and few of the craters are surrounded by bright ejecta deposits. Many craters are polygonal, indicating that their appearance was influenced by the preexisting crustal structure. In the cratered plains there are a few large (about 100km in diameter) light patches that may be degraded impact craters. If this is the case they would be similar to palimpsests on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. It has been suggested that a circular depression 245km in diameter located at 10°S 30°E is a large, highly degraded impact structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s {{focused attention on}} the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a <b>relative</b> <b>paucity</b> of basic research into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of heart disease in women. Lung cancer {{is the leading cause of}} cancer death amongst women, but while the number of women enrolled in lung cancer studies is increasing, they are still far less likely to be enrolled than men.|$|E

The disparity is no doubt due to the Free State troops' <b>relative</b> <b>paucity</b> of training and equipment compared with British forces.|$|E
40|$|Like Hipparcos, Gaia is {{designed}} to give absolute parallaxes, independent of any astrophysical reference system. And indeed, Gaia's internal zero-point error for parallaxes {{is likely to be}} smaller than any individual parallax error. Nevertheless, due in part to mechanical issues of unknown origin, there are many astrophysical questions for which the parallax zero-point error σ(π_ 0) will be the fundamentally limiting constraint. These include the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Galactic Center. We show that by using the photometric parallax estimates for RR Lyrae stars (RRL) within 8 kpc, via the ultra-precise infrared period-luminosity relation, one can independently determine a hyper-precise value for π_ 0. Despite their <b>paucity</b> <b>relative</b> to bright quasars, we show that RRL are competitive due to their order-of-magnitude improved parallax precision for each individual object relative to bright quasars. We show that this method is mathematically robust and well-approximated by analytic formulae over a wide range of relevant distances. Comment: 5 pages, 1 Figure, submitted to JKA...|$|R
40|$|Caspase- 12 is a {{dominant-negative}} regulator of caspase- 1 (IL- 1 β-converting enzyme) and an attenuator of cytokine {{responsiveness to}} septic infections. This molecular role for caspase- 12 {{appears to be}} akin {{to the role of}} cFLIP in regulating caspase- 8 in the extrinsic cell death pathway; however, unlike cFLIP/Usurpin, we demonstrate here that caspase- 12 is catalytically competent. To examine these catalytic properties, rat caspase- 12 was cloned, and the recombinant enzyme was used to examine the cleavage of macromolecular and synthetic fluorogenic substrates. Although caspase- 12 could mediate autoproteolytic maturation of its own proenzyme, in both cis and trans, it was not able to cleave any other polypeptide substrate, including other caspase proenzymes, apoptotic substrates, cytokine precursors, or proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum that normally undergo caspase-mediated proteolysis. The dearth of potential substrates for caspase- 12 also was confirmed by whole-cell diagonal-gel analysis. Autolytic cleavage within the caspase- 12 proenzyme was mapped to a single site at the large–small subunit junction, ATAD 319, and this motif was recognized by caspase- 12 when incorporated into synthetic fluorogenic substrates. The specific activity of caspase- 12 with these substates was several orders of magnitude lower than caspases- 1 and - 3, highlighting its <b>relative</b> catalytic <b>paucity.</b> In intact cells, caspase- 12 autoproteolysis occurred in the inhibitory complex containing caspase- 1. We propose that the proteolytic activity of caspase- 12 is confined to its own proenzyme and that autocleavage within the caspase- 1 complex may be a means for temporal limitation of the inhibitory effects of caspase- 12 on proinflammatory cytokine maturation...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{model of}} {{pancreatitis}} is mandatory for elucidating the pathobiology {{of the disease}} and also to see the response of a novel treatment. In addition, the need for an animal model of chronic pancreatitis is further strengthened by the <b>relative</b> inaccessibility and <b>paucity</b> of the human pancreatitis tissue. Whereas various models of acute pancreatitis and also of exocrine pancreatic tumor have been described, chronic pancr-eatitis has not been consistently reproduced in experimental animals. Many researchers attempted to establish an experimental model of chronic pancreatitis either by partially obstructing the drainage of pancreatic secretion in dogs and cats or by feeding alcohol to dogs and rats with and without temporary occlusion of the biliopancreatic duct or by surgically inducing ischaemia in the pancreas of the dogs. But, none of these models is identical with human disease. A consistently reproducible model of human chronic pancr-eatitis probably does not exist. In this expanding era of molecular biology which promises us to enhance greatly our understanding of this disease, a right experimental model of chronic pancreatitis is still in progress. 疾患の実験モデルの作成は,その疾患の病因,病態の解明,さらに治療法の開発のために重要である｡筆者らの一人は厚生省難治性膵疾患調査研究班の班員として,慢性膵炎の病態の解明や治療法の開発に関する研究を行っており,その研究の一環として,慢性膵炎の実験モデルの作成を現在行っている｡そこで,これまで報告されている慢性膵炎の実験モデルについて概要を報告した｡種々の動物や方法でヒト慢性膵炎に病因,病態,組織像が類似するモデルの作成が試みられてきたが,そのすべてが合致するような慢性膵炎モデルは確 立されてはいない｡近年の分子生物学的研究の進歩は著しく,実験モデルへの応用が種々なされている現在,より簡便で再現性のある慢性膵炎モデルの作成が望まれるところである...|$|R

25|$|Other raptors, {{large and}} small, are often {{outright}} dominated by golden eagles. In Eurasia, the <b>relative</b> <b>paucity</b> of mid-sized Buteo species {{is thought to}} be due to the radiation of large Aquila eagles that already occupied the large raptor niche and outcompeted them. In North America, where there are no Aquila eagles other than the golden eagle, Buteo species are more diverse with at least 3 large hawks (the red-tailed, Swainson's (Buteo swainsoni) and ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis)) that occur in similar habitats and sometimes eat similar prey as both each other and golden eagles. On occasion, golden eagles will kleptoparasitize or even predate these three Buteos. Other small to medium-sized diurnal raptors are known to occasionally be hunted by golden eagles, including ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), black kite (Milvus migrans), hen harriers (Circus cyaneus), Eurasian sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus), Cooper's hawks (Accipter cooperii), northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus), common buzzards (Buteo buteo), long-legged buzzards (Buteo rufinus), upland buzzards (Buteo hemilasius), rough-legged buzzards, Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), American kestrels (Falco sparverius), merlins (Falco columbarius), prairie falcons and gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus). Occasionally, golden eagles may even boldly predate these smaller species during migration in mid-flight, as was recorded at Hawk Mountain Sanctuary with a red-shouldered hawk. It is thought that on rare occasions, more nimble, smaller raptors like rough-legged buzzards and harriers can kleptoparatisize golden eagles. Interestingly, northern goshawks in Scandinavia rely on grouse to about the same extent as golden eagles there and even hunt in similar forest edge habitats there. However, the goshawks primarily hunt neonatal and fledgling grouse (30% and 53% of their take of grouse) rather than adult grouse (17% of their prey) in late summer when grouse dominate other birds in their diet, whereas the eagles seem to mainly adult grouse and hunt them aseasonally. Similarly, hen harriers may become somewhat specialized at taking young red grouse, whereas the eagles are more likely to take adults.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{critical}} {{response to}} the book, while largely complimentary in tone, was nevertheless muted and sparse. [...] This <b>relative</b> <b>paucity</b> of attention, Stannard surmises, {{might have been a}} consequence of the earlier serialisation, which meant that the essence of the story was well known before the book appeared. The Times Literary Supplements anonymous reviewer deemed the novel [...] "a study of futility", whose hero is [...] "so incapable of helping himself that he is not worth helping". Peter Quennell in the New Statesman found the story both painful and amusing—"tragedy and comedy are interdependent"—but was not overcome by the bouts of hilarity that had interrupted his reading of earlier novels such as Decline and Fall. If not exhilarating, the book was [...] "certainly the most mature and best written novel that Mr Waugh has yet produced".

40|$|A {{marsupial}} mammal from Mongolia {{representing a}} previously unreported group, Asiadelphia, offers unequivocal evidence that metatherians were {{represented on the}} continent of Asia during the Late Cretaceous (Campanian), even in the northern arid interior. Asiatherium is known by skull, left and right mandibles, {{and most of its}} postcranial skeleton. Comparisons of the dentition, ear region, and aspects of the postcranium not only allow its diagnosis as an Asian group of metatherians but also permit a diagnosis of the Metatheria based on the unequivocally apomorphous condition of the dental formula and probable replacement pattern of the protometatherian, in contrast to the more primitive therian dental formula, represented by the few known Aegialodontidae and the first dental eutherians. It appears an inescapable conclusion that the first metatherians had a more derived dental formula (and probably replacement pattern) than the earliest dental eutherians, regardless of what specific derivation from a therian ancestry is contemplated. Such a diagnosis also supports the metatherian status of other Cretaceous Asian and American taxa such as the Deltatheroida and Kokopellia. The hypothesis that Metatheria originated in North America is largely dependent on the preponderance of Cretaceous forms from North America and negative evidence from Asia (i. e., on the lack of lower latitude Early Cretaceous tropical faunas). Conversely, the <b>relative</b> Cretaceous <b>paucity</b> of placentals from North America and their greater abundance in Asia suggests the earliest flowering of the Eutheria in an unspecified region of the Old World. The concept of a holophyletic Theria (= Tribosphenida) employed here, based on the biologically significant apomorphy of the molar form-function of the first therian, entails only the tribosphenic mammals (infraclasses Tribotheria, Metatheria, and Eutheria) but not the sundry quasi-triangular-toothed mammals and their derivatives in the Mesozoic (Eupantotheria, Peramura, Monotremata, etc.). It is suggested that the Asiadelphia and Deltatheroida, the protospecies of both, with the apomorphic therian dental formula, are ancient lineages of Metatheria independent from their North American relatives probably since {{the early part of the}} Late Cretaceous...|$|R

Between population genetic identity estimates were high and only weakly correlated with geographic proximity. 	Historical rates of gene flow among coastal rainbow trout populations was estimated to be high, at least 1. 7 migrants per population per generation. Seven populations were distinguished by unique alleles, analysis of which indicate that these populations may have recently been isolated from other coastal rainbow trout populations.

40|$|We present two {{open-source}} (BSD) implementations of ellipsoidal harmonic expansions {{for solving}} problems of potential theory using separation of variables. Ellipsoidal harmonics are used surprisingly infrequently, considering their substantial value for problems ranging in scale from molecules {{to the entire}} solar system. In this article, we suggest two possible reasons for the <b>paucity</b> <b>relative</b> to spherical harmonics. The first is essentially historical [...] -ellipsoidal harmonics developed during the late 19 th century and early 20 th, when {{it was found that}} only the lowest-order harmonics are expressible in closed form. Each higher-order term requires the solution of an eigenvalue problem, and tedious manual computation seems to have discouraged applications and theoretical studies. The second explanation is practical: even with modern computers and accurate eigenvalue algorithms, expansions in ellipsoidal harmonics are significantly more challenging to compute than those in Cartesian or spherical coordinates. The present implementations reduce the "barrier to entry" by providing an easy and free way for the community to begin using ellipsoidal harmonics in actual research. We demonstrate our implementation using the specific and physiologically crucial problem of how charged proteins interact with their environment, and ask: what other analytical tools await re-discovery in an era of inexpensive computation?Comment: 25 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

The <b>relative</b> <b>paucity</b> of mappable c5 craters in the Beethoven quadrangle is indicative of the decreasing crater-production rate in the younger crater classes.
