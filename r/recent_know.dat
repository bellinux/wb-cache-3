In this paper, Under Acquistapace-Terreni conditions, we make {{extensive}} use of interpolation spaces and exponential dichotomy techniques to obtain the existence of generalized Stepanov-like pseudo almost automorphic solutions to some classes of nonautonomous partial evolution equations.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} nonemptyness of the solution set for gener-alized mixed quasi-equilibrium problems and investigate the asymptotic behavior of an iterative algorithm for finding common solution of generalized mixed equilibrium problems and fixed point problems of asymptotically nonexpansive mappings under mild conditions of iteration pa-rameters.

40|$|AbstractBy {{applying}} {{the concept of}} partially relaxed η-strong monotonicity of set-valued mappings due to author and the auxiliary variational inequality technique, some new predictor–corrector iterative algorithms for solving generalized mixed quasi-variational-like inclusions are suggested and analyzed. The convergence of the algorithms only need the continuity and the partially relaxed η-strongly monotonicity of set-valued mappings. The algorithm and convergence result are new, and generalize some <b>recent</b> <b>known</b> results in literatures...|$|R

50|$|Amphicyonids {{began to}} decline in the late Miocene, and largely {{disappeared}} in the Pliocene. The reasons for this are unclear: possibly {{it was due to}} competition with other carnivorans, but no direct evidence for this has been found. The most <b>recent</b> <b>known</b> amphicyonid remains are teeth known from the Dhok Pathan horizon, northern Pakistan, dating to the early Pleistocene, classically named Arctamphicyon lydekkeri, which may actually be synonymous with/a species of Amphicyon.|$|R

Less than 24 hours later, on March 7, another blockship the former Black Sea Fleet rescue/diving support vessel BM-416 (VM-416) was scuttled near the Ochakov.|$|R

Besides, formal and precise models of specific parts of the worls that we are building are increasingly detailed and allow us to simulate more accurately both human and natural phenomena. Paradoxically, we argue that this growth both of size and precision will take us to a Computer Science that is closer to humanization...|$|R

This characterization is then applied to readily obtain some (more) <b>recent</b> <b>known</b> results and some new results on the asymptotic distribution of zeros of sections of random power series, extricating quite naturally the deterministic ingredients. Finally, we study the possible limits of the zero counting probabilities of a power series...|$|R

50|$|The Red Deer Cave People {{were the}} most <b>recent</b> <b>known</b> prehistoric archaic human population. Fossils dated to between 14,500 and 11,500 years old were found in Red Deer Cave and Longlin Cave in China.

Evidence shows large deer were cooked in the Red Deer Cave, giving the people their name.|$|R
