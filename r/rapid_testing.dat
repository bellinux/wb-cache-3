40|$|Background: HIV rapid {{antibody}} assays {{are important}} for screening children aged 98 %. Seroreversion rates were lowest with the Determine <b>rapid</b> <b>test.</b> Three HIV <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> (Abon, Advanced Quality, Determine) detected 100 % of HIV-infected children < 18 months of age, the Reveal, SD Bioline and Insti <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> missed 27 (41. 5 %), 1 (4. 5 %) and 1 (1. 5 %) of the HIV-infected children respectively. In children â‰¥ 18 months of age, sensitivity of <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> for detecting HIV infection ranged from 69. 2 % to 100 % and specificity of all <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> was 100 %. Conclusions: None of the 6 HIV <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> evaluated achieved both the World Health Organisation recommended sensitivity and specificity standards for any antibody assay used in screening for HIV exposure in children < 18 months.

40|$|BackgroundAn {{alternate}} HIV testing algorithm {{has been}} proposed which includes a fourth-generation immunoassay followed by an HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 antibody differentiation supplemental test for reactive specimens and a nucleic acid test (NAT) for specimens with discordant results. ObjectiveTo evaluate the performance of five <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> (Alere Clearview, Bio-Rad Multispot, OraSure OraQuick, MedMira Reveal, and Trinity Biotech Unigold) as the supplemental antibody assay in the algorithm. Study DesignA total of 3273 serum and plasma specimens that were third- generation immunoassay repeatedly reactive and Western blot (WB) negative or indeterminate were <b>tested</b> with <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> and NAT. Specimens were classified by NAT 1) HIV- 1 infected (NAT-reactive; n= 184, 5. 6 %), 2) HIV-status unknown (NAT nonreactive; n= 3078, 94. 2 %) or by Multispot 3) HIV- 2 positive (n= 5), 4) HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 positive (n= 6). Excluding HIV- 2 positive specimens, we calculated the proportion of reactive <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> among specimens with reactive and nonreactive NAT. ResultsThe proportion of infected specimens with reactive <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> results and negative or indeterminate WB ranged from 30. 4 % (56) to 47. 8 % (88) depending on the <b>rapid</b> <b>test.</b> From 1 % to 2 % of NAT-negative specimens had reactive <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> results. ConclusionsIn these diagnostically challenging specimens, all <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> identified infections that were missed by the Western blot, but only one FDA-approved <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> could differentiate HIV- 1 from HIV- 2. Regardless of which <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> {{is used as a}} supplemental test in the alternative algorithm, false-positive algorithm results (i. e., reactive screening and <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> in uninfected person) may occur, which will need to be resolved during the baseline medical evaluation.

The {{aim of this study}} is to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the Ov 16 <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> into onchocerciasis surveillance activities in Senegal, based on the following attributes of acceptability, usability, and cost. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 13 villages in southeastern Senegal in May 2016. Individuals 5 years and older were invited to participate in a demographic questionnaire, an Ov 16 <b>rapid</b> <b>test,</b> a skin snip biopsy, and an acceptability interview. <b>Rapid</b> <b>test</b> technicians were interviewed and a costing analysis was conducted. Of 1, 173 participants, 1, 169 (99. 7 %) agreed to the <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> while 383 (32. 7 %) agreed to skin snip microscopy. The sero-positivity rate of the <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> among those tested was 2. 6 % with zero positives 10 years and younger. None of the 383 skin snips were positive for Ov microfilaria. Community members appreciated that the <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> was performed quickly, was not painful, and provided reliable results. The total costs for this surveillance activity was $ 22, 272. 83, with a cost per test conducted at $ 3. 14 for <b>rapid</b> <b>test,</b> $ 7. 58 for skin snip microscopy, and $ 13. 43 for shared costs. If no participants had refused skin snip microscopy, the total cost per method with shared costs would have been around $ 16 per person tested. In this area with low onchocerciasis sero-positivity, there was high acceptability and perceived value of the <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> by community members and technicians.

50|$|The rapid HIV testing {{employed}} by Checkpoint {{was for the}} whole of its existence unique in the Netherlands, because it was at that time not used by the various local health authorities. Such authorities and physicians employed the regular HIV antibody test and clients had to wait 1 or 2 weeks for the result. When an increasing number of local health authorities began using the rapid HIV test, Checkpoint had served its purpose and could be closed down. The rapid HIV test enabled a reliable outcome to be generated within 15 to 20 minutes, which in practice lowered the threshold for such testing. Because in this way more people opted for testing, more HIV-positive people could be reached. A clear advantage is that the diagnosis is made at the earliest possible stage of the infection, facilitating adequate treatment. In addition, through successful early treatment, the infectious period for HIV-positive people can be reduced. In addition to developing the rapid HIV testing methodology, now widely employed, Checkpoint was constantly engaged in promoting the introduction of this <b>rapid</b> <b>testing</b> both in the Netherlands and abroad and in lending support to such initiatives.|$|E
40|$|Background : In many {{patients}} with chest pain, the correct diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction(AMI) is dependent {{mainly on the}} measurement of cardiac markers such as cardiac creatin kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI),because the electrocardiogram is often non-diagnostic. The measurement of cardiac markers are superior {{for the detection of}} minor myocardial injury and more-accurative diagnosis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the assay of routin method of CK-MB and cTnI in comparison with <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> method in suspected patients to AMI. Materials and Methods: The study population comprised 142 patients admitted to the emergency ward with acute chest pain for less than 12 hours before admission.
