40|$|<b>Research</b> <b>surveys</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> are {{undertaken}} yearly {{to monitor}} the distribution and abundance of fish stocks. In the survey data, {{a small number of}} high fish concentration values are often encountered, which denote hotspots of interest. But statistically, they are responsible for important uncertainty in the estimation. Thus understanding their spatial predictability given their surroundings is expected to reduce such uncertainty. Indicator variograms and cross-variograms allow to understand the spatial relationship between values above a cutoff {{and the rest of the}} distribution under that cutoff. Using these tools, a “top” cutoff can be evidenced above which values are spatially uncorrelated with their lower surroundings. Spatially, the geometric set corresponding to the top cutoff corresponds to biological hotspots, inside which high concentrations are contained. The hotspot areas were mapped using a multivariate kriging model, considering indicators in different years as covariates. The case study considered here is the series of acoustic surveys Pelgas performed in the Bay of Biscay to estimate anchovy and other pelagic fish species. The data represent tonnes of fish by square nautical mile along transects regularly spaced. Top cutoffs were estimated in each year. The areas of such anchovy hotspots are then mapped by co-kriging using all information across the time series. The geostatistical tools were adapted for estimating hotspot habitat maps and their variability, which are key information for the spatial management of fish stocks. Tools used here are generic and will apply in many engineering fields where predicting high concentration values spatially is of interest...|$|E

40|$|Cetaceans are {{mobile and}} spend long periods underwater. Because of this, {{modelling}} their habitat could {{be subject to}} a serious problem of false absence. Furthermore, extensive <b>surveys</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> are time and money consuming, and presence–absence data are difficult to apply. This study compares the ability of two presence–absence and two presence-only habitat modelling methods and uses the example of the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The data consist of summer visual and acoustical detections of sperm whales, compiled between 1998 and 2005. Habitat maps were computed using topographical and hydrological eco-geographical variables. Four methods were compared: principal component analysis (PCA), ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA), generalized linear model (GLM) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). The evaluation of the models was achieved by calculating the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the models and their respective area under the curve (AUC). Presence–absence methods (GLM, AUC= 0. 70, and MARS, AUC= 0. 79) presented better AUC than presence-only methods (PCA, AUC= 0. 58, and ENFA, AUC= 0. 66), but this difference was not statistically significant, except between the MARS and the PCA models. The four models showed an influence of both topographical and hydrological factors, but the resulting habitat suitability maps differed. The core habitat on the continental slope was well highlighted by the four models, while GLM and MARS maps also showed a suitable habitat in the offshore waters. Presence–absence methods are therefore recommended for modelling the habitat suitability of cetaceans, as they seem more accurate to highlight complex habitat. However, the use of presence-only techniques, in particular ENFA, could be very useful for a first model of the habitat range or when important <b>surveys</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> are not possible.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} some results of two <b>surveys</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> {{carried out in}} the {{surroundings}} of a urban wastewater discharge on the coast of the Golfo di Palermo, western Sicily (Italy). At the time of the surveys (year 2005) the stretch of water lying before {{the central part of the}} capital town received the untreated wastewater originating from about 200 000 inhabitants, which was discharged on-shore without any prior treatment by the free-surface outfall of “Porta Felice main sewer”. This outfall has crucial importance in the water quality; indeed, the Municipality is steadily implementing a plan featuring an intercepting main sewer along the coast and some pumping stations to connect all the main sewers to the main wastewater treatment plant, located in the SE boundary area of the town. At the moment of the surveys, however, no mitigation measure had been applied yet and the quality of the Gulf was still largely affected by it. Part of the Sanitation Plan was the characterization of the seawater; to this aim, in August and November, 2005, the Università degli Studi di Palermo - on behalf of the Municipality’s Ufficio del Centro Storico - carried out two survey cruises in which the most important seawater quality features were investigated.

40|$|Structure models {{associated}} with P- and S-wave velocities contain {{considerable amount of}} information on lithology and geophysical properties, {{which can be used}} to better understand the complexity of the deep crustal structure. However, records of converted shear waves are less due to the speciality of seismic <b>survey</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> and the rigorous generated conditions. The study on shear waves has always been a weakness for studying the deep crustal structures of South China Sea (SCS). In this paper, eleven three-component OBSs were deployed along the Profile OBS- 2001 in northeastern SCS. After the data processing of polarization and band-pass filter, converted S-wave phases were identified in the radical component records of nine OBSs. Taking the OBS 7 as an example, identification and analysis of converted shear waves were presented and discussed in detail. A few phase groups, such as PWSc, PgSs, PnSc, PmS, and PWSn, were found coming from the deep crust or Moho interface by simple theoretical model calculation and ray-tracing simulation. The results not only provide the underlying basis for studies of S-wave velocity structure and Poisson's ratio structure, but also reveal the relationship between crustal petrology and seismology, which will be of importance for making full use of S-wave information in the future.

40|$|Species mapping is an {{essential}} tool for conservation programmes as it provides clear pictures {{of the distribution of}} marine resources. However, in fishery ecology, the amount of objective scientific information is limited and data may not always be directly comparable. Information about the distribution of marine species can be derived from two main sources: fishery-independent data (scientific <b>surveys</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea)</b> and fishery-dependent data (collection and sampling by observers in commercial vessels). The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare whether these two different sources produce similar, complementary, or different results. We compare them in the specific context of identifying the Essential Fish Habitats of three elasmobranch species (S. canicula, G. melastomus, and E. spinax). Similarity and prediction statistics are used to compare the two different spatial patterns obtained by applying the same Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling approach in the two sources. Results showed that the spatial patterns obtained are similar, although differences are present. In particular, models based on fishery-dependent data are better able to identify temporal relationships between the probability of presence of the species and seasonal environmental variables. In contrast, fishery-independent data better discriminate spatial locations where a species is present or absent. Besides the spatial and temporal differences of the two datasets, the consistency of habitat results highlights the inclusion in each dataset of most of the environmental envelope of each species, both in time and space. Consequently, sampling data should be adapted to each species to reasonably cover their environmental envelope, and a combination of datasets will likely provide a better habitat estimation than using each dataset independently. These findings can be useful in helping fishery managers improve definition of survey design and analyses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Web-based {{teaching}} and learning is rapidly emerging as a predominant paradigm {{in the delivery of}} education in society. Internet is the ocean of knowledge. This ocean can be made available to all students as early as possible in their life. So Information Technology & related tools can be introduced in school education by using World Wide Web (WWW) as education delivery medium. The WWW is used to provide information with great prospect and extend learning outside space and time boundaries. The remarkable developments in IT and networking have opened the doors of education. In the era of IT e-learning / Web based learning (WBL) can be efficiently used for different types of education. Most of the population of India is in the rural areas where literacy rate is poor {{due to the lack of}} educational facilities. This paper discusses the present scenario of education and discusses that Web based education / learning has potential to meet the perceived need for flexible pace, place & face. To find the effectiveness of implementation of WBL in school education a survey was conducted in various schools of Satara District.
