40|$|The muscarinic {{receptor}} mediating vasodilatation of {{the rabbit}} aorta and dog femoral artery has been assessed using muscarinic antagonists. With {{the exception of}} pirenzepine, the antagonist affinities {{were similar to those}} <b>reported</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ileal receptors and dissimilar to those <b>reported</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> atrial receptors.

5|$|Because the Dreamcast had a {{much smaller}} user base than PlayStation platforms, Capcom knew the series could not survive on the platform.

The extended cut was announced in November 2000. It has approximately 10 minutes of new cinematic sequences that reveal more about Wesker's involvement with Umbrella. The rest of the game remains mostly unchanged, although Capcom claimed they made some graphical enhancements.

Fermi was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 that resulted in denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance.|$|E

5|$|In 1873, Barton S. Alexander {{completed}} a <b>report</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{that was the}} first attempt at creating a Central Valley Project. In 1904, the Bureau of Reclamation (then the Reclamation Service) first became interested in creating such a water project, but did not get far involved until a series of droughts and related disasters occurred in the early 1920s. The State of California passed the Central Valley Project Act in 1933, which authorized Reclamation to sell revenue bonds in order to raise about $170 million for the project. Unfortunately, because of insufficient money in the state's treasury and the coincidence with the Great Depression, California turned to the national government for funding to build the project. This resulted in several transfers of the project between California and the federal government, and between Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The first dams and canals of the project started going up in the late 1930s, and the last facilities were completed in the early 1970s. Other features of the project were never constructed, some lie partly finished, or are still awaiting authorization.|$|E

The Special Investigation Team's findings added 24 more names to the 46 people arrested by the police. Before the trial began, 6 of the accused died.
