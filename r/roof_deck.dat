5|$|Speakers at {{the inquiry}} have also testified that a {{significant}} volume of city traffic regularly cut across the <b>roof</b> <b>deck</b> as a bypass of the traffic lights {{at the corner of}} Hillside Drive and Ontario Avenue, resulting in more stress on the structure than it had been designed to handle. The NORR report speculated that a heavy vehicle might have contributed to a previously undetected partial failure of the support structure a few months prior to the final collapse.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 inquest {{into the}} roof {{collapse}} (see Government reaction below), testimony {{has revealed that}} many unpublicized structural problems at the mall dated {{all the way back}} to its initial construction in the late 1970s. In particular, the expansion joint above the escalators, the failure of which appears to have caused the <b>roof</b> <b>deck</b> collapse, was already not properly binding to the concrete, in turn allowing water to seep into the building's seams, as early as 1981 — barely a year after the mall's original opening. The expansion joint was fixed many times, and fully replaced twice, during the building's lifetime, yet always began tearing away from the concrete again shortly after the repairs were complete.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally most flat roofs in {{the western}} world make use of tar or asphalt more usually felt paper applied over <b>roof</b> <b>decking</b> to keep a {{building}} watertight. The felt paper is in turn covered with a flood coat of bitumen (asphalt or tar) and then gravel to keep the sun's heat, UV rays and weather off it and helps protect it from cracking or blistering and degradation. <b>Roof</b> <b>decking</b> is usually of plywood, chipboard or OSB boards (OSB = Oriented Strand Board, also known as Sterling board) of around 18mm thickness, steel or concrete. The mopping of bitumen is applied in two or more coats (usually 3 or 4) as a hot liquid, heated in a kettle. A flooded coat of bitumen is applied over the felts and gravel is embedded in the hot bitumen.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{method of}} {{applying}} radiant {{barrier to the}} roof in new construction {{is to use a}} radiant barrier that is pre-laminated to OSB panels or roof sheathing.

25|$|The {{original}} {{nursing home}} complex was a 1,906sqft(177m²) brick building {{consisting of two}} floors. In 1959, a second building {{was added to the}} rear which includes a garden. The addition increased the size of the complex to 5,179sqft(481m²). The addition was built with precast concrete floor and roof slabs connected to steel beams and columns. In 1966, the brick building was removed and was replaced by a three story building; at the same time, a third floor was added to the original building constructed in 1959. Overall, the second addition expanded the complex to 9,466sqft(879m²). In 1973, a third building was added with a 10ft(3m) corridor connecting to the existing building complex. The third building also consisted of three floors and had a floor area of 3,613sqft(336m²). The construction of the third building, consisted of precast concrete floor slabs, metal <b>roof</b> <b>deck</b> on steel bar joists. All of the buildings were covered with a 5/8inch fire rated plasterboard.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the B. F. Saul Company, {{undertook}} {{the restoration}} and {{renovation of the}} historic main building, a project that was expected to cost $60 million. Contractors installed new double-hung mahogany windows, built a new roof and <b>roof</b> <b>deck,</b> and carefully cleaned the brick façade and aluminum spandrels following preservation standards. After discussions with the Art Deco Society of Washington, D.C. {{as well as the}} residents, the B. F. Saul Company decided to preserve the original floor plans of most apartments. As the contractors renovated each apartment, they kept the original hardware, including the glass doorknobs and brass hinges, as well as the kitchen cabinets and apartment doors, and they sanded and stained the original wood floors. To bring the building up to current standards, they replaced the wiring and plumbing, and installed a sprinkler system and central air-conditioning in the apartments and public areas. The central air-conditioning replaced the huge basement fans, which had been in use since 1931, as well as window units. The company put new stoves and refrigerators in the apartments and, for the first time, washers and dryers. Shops and businesses on the lobby floor supplied such services for the residents.|$|E

500|$|Preliminary damage surveys {{conducted}} {{by a group of}} structural engineers from Texas Tech University determined that many of the frame homes that were destroyed by the Bridge Creek−Moore tornado were constructed below minimal residential building code standards, discovering some structural deficiencies that violated codes, which were considered to be inadequate for regions prone to tornadic activity (under federal building code standards, frame homes that were properly strapped and bolted would have withstood winds between 152 and 157 miles per hour (245 and 253km/h), equivalent to an F2 tornado). The team, led by meteorological researcher Charles Doswell and storm damage engineer/meteorologist Tim Marshall, determined that nails attached to a plywood <b>roof</b> <b>deck</b> in one damaged home were not properly anchored to the rafters; several homes in rural areas that were swept nearly [...] from their original location did not have anchor bolts that secured the frame to their foundations, as was the case at Country Place Estates, where the homes − which left a trail of debris strewn [...] away from their location − were attached to the concrete foundations by tapered cut nails that extended only a half-inch to the bases; many homes that were left at least partially standing also had their garage doors (mainly those made from aluminum material) collapse inward, allowing the tornado's destructive winds to enter the houses.|$|E
50|$|OSB is a {{material}} with favorable mechanical properties {{that make it}} particularly suitable for load-bearing applications in construction. The most common uses are as sheathing in walls, flooring, and <b>roof</b> <b>decking.</b> For exterior wall applications, panels are available with a radiant-barrier layer pre-laminated to one side; this eases installation and increases energy performance of the building envelope. OSB also sees some use in furniture production.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{application}} for a radiant barrier is as a facing for attics. For a traditional shingle roof, radiant barriers may be applied over the rafters or trusses and under the <b>roof</b> <b>decking.</b> This application method has the radiant barrier sheets draped over the trusses of rafters, creating a small air space above with the radiant barrier facing into the entire interior attic space below.|$|R
50|$|One {{problem with}} {{maintaining}} flat roofs {{is that if}} water does penetrate the barrier covering (be it traditional or a modern membrane), it can travel a long way before causing visible damage or leaking into a building {{where it can be}} seen. Thus, {{it is not easy to}} find the source of the leak in order to repair it. Once underlying <b>roof</b> <b>decking</b> is soaked, it often sags, creating more room for water to accumulate and further worsening the problem.|$|R

2500|$|Design issues {{continued}} to plague the project, however. Throughout 1966, private developers {{fought with the}} General Services Administration in hearings before the NCPC, which was closing in on a decision to give final approval to the project. At issue were the [...] high equipment penthouses atop the building. Private developers demanded that they be given the right to raise their buildings by the additional height as well, while other government agencies argued that giving the FBI building a height waiver would set a bad precedent and weaken government height restrictions along Pennsylvania Avenue. With the overhanging <b>roof</b> <b>deck</b> of the FBI building already having lost one of its three stories, the NCPC agreed to the waiver on December 1, 1966. Meanwhile, the President's Council on Pennsylvania Avenue was still pushing for an arcade on the ground level along Pennsylvania Avenue NW. [...] The Council argued that all buildings along Pennsylvania Avenue should include an arcade so that pedestrians could walk along the street somewhat protected from the elements. [...] The FBI and private developers both opposed the arcade requirement. The Council believed that if the FBI were given an exemption from the requirement, it {{would be unable to}} enforce it with other builders. The FBI won the day by arguing that rapists and muggers would hide in the arcades, making Pennsylvania Avenue unsafe for pedestrians and workers. The NCPC agreed, and voted in favor of an exemption on September 14, 1967.|$|E
