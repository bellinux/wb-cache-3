40|$|Summary Liberty versus Security Who {{supports}} the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>freedom</b> by governmental means {{in order to}} increase collective security? The question of this paper is ‘what affects people’s willingness to trade-off individual liberty for security?’ We assess who agrees with the statement that <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>freedom</b> by governmental means is allowed {{in order to increase}} security. We further investigate the support for concrete security measures which encroach on individual liberty and privacy. Various hypotheses are tested using the Dutch National Freedom Survey 2005 (NVO 2005). We find that characteristics of vulnerability have a stronger influence on the support for concrete measures than on the general willingness of people to trade-off liberty for security. Contrary to our predictions this also holds for factors related to social conservatism. Furthermore, we found that social groups subscribing to conservative norms are more likely to support freedom limiting security measures. Remarkably, the same also applies to people holding liberal political views. ...|$|E

40|$|Meeting Theme: The art of {{managing}} diabetes mellitus in older adults - optimize control, avoid hypoglycaemia and delay frailtyPlatform PresentationINTRODUCTION: Older {{people should be}} treated with respect, dignity, and compassion. However, older people are vulnerable to the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> their <b>personal</b> <b>freedom</b> {{by the use of}} physical and chemical restraints, which may negatively influence their physical and psychological well-being, and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors for the use of physical and chemical restraints amongst older people living in residential care in Hong Kong. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Hong Kong Longitudinal Study on Long-Term Care Facility (LTCF) Residents, between 2005 and 2012. Trained assessors (nurses, social workers and therapists) utilized the Minimum Data Set Resident Assessment Instrument (MDS-RAI 2. 0) to collect the data from 10 residential LTCFs. We used the data from residents who had their second annual assessment to ensure completeness of data over the previous 12 months. Use of chemical restraint was defined as receiving any of the 3 medications including anti-psychotic, anti-anxiety and hypnotic agents, during the previous 12 months. Use of physical restraint was defined as receiving any of the 5 restraining interventions including full bedside rails on all open sides of bed, other types of bedside rails used, trunk restraint, limb restraint, and the use of chair to prevent rising. Using a hierarchical logistic regression model, we assessed the incremental predictive power for: a) demographics (Model I); b) physical factors (Model II); c) cognitive factors (Model III); and d) psychiatric factors (Model IV) on the use of chemical and physical restraints. Ethical approval was granted by the IRB. RESULTS: We included 1, 287 older people living in residential care. Mean (±SD) age was 83. 2 (± 8. 4) years, 65 % were females, 28 % were married and 84 % had primary education level or below. Mean Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score was 2. 8 (± 2. 2, range 0 - 6). 10 % experienced falls in the past 6 months, 8. 4 % were fed via nasogastric tube, 33 % had dementia, 11 % had psychiatric diseases, 3 % had mental health history, and around 1 % had mood disturbance, delusions, hallucinations, delirium or behavioural problems. Overall, 18. 2 % (range 11. 5 - 22. 5 %) of the residents received chemical restraint, 58. 8 % (43. 8 - 64. 7 %) received physical restrained, 63. 1 % (49. 5 - 69. 9 %) received either chemical or physical restraint, and 13. 9 % (5. 7 - 19. 6 %) received both. FOR CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS: Model I had no effects; Model II showed having more ADL impairment had higher odds; Model III showed having dementia, delirium and behavioural problems had higher odds; and Model IV showed having a mental health history, psychiatric diseases, delusions and hallucinations had higher odds. For physical restraints: Model I showed being older and married had higher odds; Model II showed having more ADL impairment had higher odds; Model III showed lower cognitive performance score (CPS) had higher odds; and Model IV showed psychiatric factors had no effects. For chemical or physical restraints: Model I showed older and married had higher odds; Model II showed having more ADL impairment had higher odds; Model III showed having dementia and cognitive impairment (lower Cognitive Performance Score) had higher odds; and Model IV showed having a mental health history and psychiatric diseases had higher odds. CONCLUSION: Restraint use was highly prevalent amongst older people living in residential care in Hong Kong. We found significant incremental predictive power for specific physical factors (ADL impairment), cognitive factors (cognitive impairment and dementia) and psychiatric factors (mental health and psychiatric diseases) on the use of chemical and physical restraints. These findings have important implications on the healthcare, social and ethical treatments of the older and vulnerable people living in residential care in Hong Kong...|$|R

The [...] "Swing Youth" [...] usually came from middle-class families in northern Germany. Hamburg, the most Anglophile of German cities, was regarded as the [...] "capital" [...] of the [...] "Swing Youth" [...] movement. The [...] "Swing Youth" [...] were Anglophiles who preferred to dress in the [...] "English style", with the boys wearing checkered coats and homburg hats, carrying umbrellas, and smoking pipes, while the girls wore their hair curled and applied much make-up. In the Third Reich, the [...] "natural look" [...] with no make-up and braided hair was the preferred style for women, so the [...] "swing babies", as female [...] "Swing Youth" [...] were called, were rejecting what their regime had prescribed for them. Reflecting their Anglophilia, the [...] "Swing Youth" [...] often preferred to talk and write {{to each other in}} English (English together with French were languages widely taught in Gymnasium since the early 20th century). For {{the first five years of}} the Third Reich, Nazi propaganda had been favorable to Britain, as Hitler had hoped for an Anglo-German alliance, but in 1938, when it became clear that Britain was not going to ally with Germany, the propaganda of the regime turned fiercely Anglophobic: a major British-bashing campaign was launched in the autumn of 1938. In this light, the Anglophilia of the Swing Youth could be seen as an implicit rejection of the regime. Likewise, the [...] "Swing Youth" [...] tended to welcome Jewish and Mischlinge ("mixed race") teenagers who wanted to join their gatherings. The German musicologist Guido Fackler described the Swingjugend embracing of American music and the [...] "English style" [...] as follows: [...] "The Swingjugend rejected the Nazi state, above all because of its ideology and uniformity, its militarism, the [...] "Führer principle" [...] and the leveling Volksgemeinschaft (people's community). They experienced a massive <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> their <b>personal</b> <b>freedom.</b> They rebelled against all this with jazz and swing, which stood for a love of life, self-determination, non-conformism, freedom, independence, liberalism, and internationalism." [...] Despite the British declaration on war on Germany on 3 September 1939, the [...] "Swing Youth" [...] continued to adopt the [...] "English style", which led to the Nazi regime cracking down on the [...] "Swing Youth": in one raid in 1941 in Hamburg, about 300 [...] "Swing Kids" [...] were arrested. At least seventy of the [...] "Swing Youth", considered to be leaders of the movement, were sent to concentration camps. The [...] "Swing Youth" [...] movement was not overtly political, though it rejected aspects of Nazi ideology, but the persecution of the [...] "Swing Youth" [...] to some taking a more anti-Nazi stance. Very similar to the Swing Youth were the Zazou movement in France who preferred to dress in the style anglais with umbrellas (seen as a symbol of Britishness in France) a popular fashion accessory and their hair done up á la mode d'Oxford, liked to speak to each other in English as it was [...] "cooler", and like their German counterparts loved British and American popular music. The French writer Simone de Beauvoir described the Zazou look as [...] "the young men wore dirty drape suits with 'drainpipe' trousers under their sheep-skinned lined jackets and liberally brillianted their long hair, the girls favored tight roll-coller sweaters with short flared skirts and wooden platform shoes, sported dark glasses with big lenses, put on heavy make-up and went bare-headed to show their dyed hair, set off by a lock of different hue".|$|R
