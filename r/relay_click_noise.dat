5000|$|Joints {{that make}} <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> (also {{a symptom of}} osteoarthritis.) ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a strange}} <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> in the {{distance}} not unlike castanets.|$|R
25|$|The tongue {{may stick}} to the palate, causing a <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> during speech, or the lips may stick together.|$|R
40|$|An FM <b>click</b> <b>noise</b> {{suppressor}} {{was evaluated}} {{by means of}} several experimental tests conducted to verify previous test results. The range and worst case type of operation for the suppressor were also determined. A brief theoretical justification {{for the existence of}} FM <b>click</b> <b>noise</b> near threshold conditions is presented. It is concluded that the circuit does perform click suppression, but over a limited range. Suggestions for improvement of the circuit are given...|$|R
50|$|When struck {{they produce}} a bright <b>clicking</b> <b>noise.</b> Claves are {{sometimes}} hollow and {{carved in the}} middle to amplify the sound.|$|R
50|$|In 1970 the Differential Outcome Effect was {{discovered}} by Trapold when testing the reasoning behind the theory. He created an experiment where rats were taught to discriminate between a <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> and a tone. He associated the left bar with the <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> and the right bar with the tone. The experimental group was given sucrose for one response and food for the other. The control group was randomly given either food or sucrose for each response. The rats {{in the experimental group}} were able to discriminate between the two stimuli faster than the rats in the control group.|$|R
60|$|He felt on the ground, {{found the}} parcel, and shook it. A <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> issued from inside. Swithin smote his {{forehead}} with his hand, and {{walked up and down}} like a mad fellow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Geibel {{placed his}} hand encouragingly on Fritz's shoulder, and the {{lieutenant}} bowed low, accompanying the action with a harsh <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> in his throat, unpleasantly suggestive of a death rattle. But that was only a detail.|$|R
50|$|The {{voice is}} {{described}} as a faint yeah. Mating display calls of groups can be heard at long distances (more than 300 m) and include a rising and falling series of chirping calls and accelerating <b>clicking</b> <b>noises.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{reason for}} the <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> made {{is due to the}} {{specific}} switch technology used nearly universally in computer mice. The switch is a subminiature precision snap-action type; the first of such types were the Honeywell MICRO SWITCH products.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tambourine}} pedal or [...] tpedal is a percussion attachment for the drumkit {{to provide}} {{sound of a}} tambourine without the stick <b>click</b> <b>noise.</b> Tpedal is performed by foot on a kick pedal. This instrument is an idiophone percussion.|$|R
50|$|Form's {{most famous}} side {{effect is a}} <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> {{produced}} by typing on the keyboard on the 18th of every month. However, this payload very rarely appears on modern computers, as it will not execute if a keyboard driver is installed.|$|R
40|$|Threshold {{extension}} device connected between {{demodulator output}} and filter output minimizes <b>clicking</b> <b>noise.</b> Device consists of click-eliminating signal transfer channel with follow-and-hold circuit and detector for sensing click impulses. Final output consists of signal plus low level noise without high amplitude impulses...|$|R
50|$|If {{disturbed}} {{the adult}} can flick itself high (up to 245 mm) into the air, with a takeoff speed {{of up to}} 2.27 m/s, making a loud <b>clicking</b> <b>noise.</b> It can also use this ability to right itself if it falls onto its back.|$|R
50|$|Males {{present some}} {{courtship}} behavior, flying high and displaying their tail, then diving {{and making a}} <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> with the tail. Once courtship ends, the couple mates and builds a nest in which they tend to use synthetic fibers from human activity when available.|$|R
50|$|The Barracuda LP series {{also present}} {{firmware}} issues {{that might be}} alleviated by the latest firmware available on the Seagate web site (CC35), although {{there are reports that}} drives with the CC35 firmware loaded continue to exhibit the same problems as earlier firmware releases. The most commonly referred issue with the Barracuda LP series drives appears to be one variation or another of the infamous click of death problem; the drive will start to emit a regular <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> at some point in its early life (possibly even at first start) and after some time will fail altogether, often after a few months of use. While the <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> is emitted, the hard drive is inaccessible and may prevent the BIOS from detecting it.|$|R
5|$|The use of {{echolocation}} {{was once}} used to separate Aerodramus {{from the other}} non-echolocating cave swiftlet genera Collocalia and Hydrochous (virtually nothing is known about Schoutedenapus). However, recently, the pygmy swiftlet, Collocalia troglodytes, was discovered making similar <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> {{both inside and outside}} its roosting cave.|$|R
50|$|The Amiga is also {{notorious for}} the {{clicking}} sound {{made by the}} floppy drive mechanism if no disk is inserted. The purpose is to detect disk changes, and various utilities such as Noclick exist that can disable the <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> to the relief of many Amiga users.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{echolocation}} {{was once}} used to separate Aerodramus {{from the other}} non-echolocating cave swiftlet genera Collocalia and Hydrochous (virtually nothing is known about Schoutedenapus). However, recently, the pygmy swiftlet, Collocalia troglodytes, was discovered making similar <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> {{both inside and outside}} its roosting cave.|$|R
5000|$|The song's {{arrangement}} uses a Latin percussion instrument {{known as}} claves. These are pairs of small wooden sticks {{that make a}} distinctive high pitched <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> when struck together. The Who previously used this same instrument on the song [...] "Disguises", which was recorded in 1966.|$|R
60|$|Twice {{the young}} man parted his lips. Then he stooped with a sudden gesture and turning up the right leg of his {{trousers}} he pulled down his sock and thrust forward his shin. The doctor made a <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> with his tongue as he glanced at it.|$|R
50|$|In clicker training, {{a parrot}} is taught to {{associate}} a click with receiving a reward {{and is a}} particularly popular form of positive reinforcement training. In clicker training, the <b>click</b> <b>noise</b> {{can be used to}} mark the instant a parrot does the desired behavior, making for more efficient training.|$|R
50|$|Botta's pocket gophers {{are active}} {{for a total}} of about nine hours each day, {{spending}} most of their time feeding in their burrows, but are not restricted to either daylight or night time. They make little sound, although they do communicate by making <b>clicking</b> <b>noises,</b> soft hisses, and squeaks.|$|R
5000|$|Other common {{players such}} as Winamp read the media files in tiny bits, {{just in time for}} playback, and they lack this simple, but effective, feature of loading media files into RAM, which {{prevents}} any interruptions during playback, including the <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> which may occur as a result of such interruption.|$|R
50|$|Unlike bats, the swiftlets make <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> for {{echolocation}} {{that are}} well within the human range of hearing. Two broadband pulses are separated by a slight pause. The length of the pause shortens as light becomes poorer. The clicks are followed by the twittering call when the bird is approaching its nest.|$|R
5000|$|The {{instrumentation}} {{is a mix}} {{of standard}} punk with electronic devices for mechanical tones: A Roland CR-68 drum machine does simultaneous beats alongside a standard drum kit; the Maxi-Korg 800DV synthesizer was used for a unique blipping noise, dubbed by the music press as a [...] "musical stapler", and as a vocoder for [...] "Art Blind". P-Model came to argue with Warner-Pioneer, Sakuma and engineer Makoto Furukawa daily over the Yamaha YC-10 combo organ: The band chose it for a <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> made when a key is pressed, the production wanted to {{take it out of the}} mix and constantly told P-Model to rent an expensive keyboard, which they refused adamantly. P-Model would alter the equalization settings Furukawa used to remove the <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> every time he looked away from the mixing console until he stopped noticing it.|$|R
50|$|Like other snapper shrimp, {{one of the}} chelipeds is {{much bigger}} than the other and is {{modified}} to make an explosive <b>clicking</b> <b>noise.</b> The body is only slightly laterally compressed and does not have a crest on the carapace. There is an orbital hood surrounding the eyes. Male shrimp can grow to 3 cm.|$|R
50|$|Off-normal {{contacts}} typically serve {{two additional}} functions. They may implement a shunt across the transmitter circuit and induction coil {{to maximize the}} pulsing signal of the dial by eliminating all internal impedances of the telephone set. Another function is to short-circuit the telephone receiver during dialing, to prevent audible <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> from being heard by the telephone user.|$|R
50|$|Palatal {{myoclonus}} is a rapid {{spasm of}} the palatal (roof of the mouth) muscles, {{which results in}} clicking or popping in the ear. Chronic clonus is often due to lesions of the central tegmental tract (which connects the red nucleus to the ipsilateral inferior olivary nucleus). Uniquely, the <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> does not subside when the patient sleeps.|$|R
60|$|The shorter man fumbled in {{his pocket}} for some time, and then {{produced}} a small paper packet. He opened this, and took out of it half a handful of whitish granules, which he poured down through the hole. A curious <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> followed {{from the inside of}} the box, and both men smiled in a satisfied way.|$|R
50|$|Eddie Tolman is {{the star}} of this chapter. Being a super genius, Tolman moved on to do great things. His paranoia, however, was holding him from having an overall {{successful}} life. He was paranoid that a satellite called POSSE was trying to take him over, because he would see images, and hear a <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> while {{he would try to}} sleep. After studying Tolman, Siegel can't seem to help him until he speaks to his wife. Mrs. Tolman explains Dr. Tolman's obsession with the film El Topo, {{and the fact that he}} grinds his teeth at night. Siegel concludes that Tolman's paranoia of a satellite is actually stemmed from the film. The images are just pieces of the film playing in his mind, scaring him, and the <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> are just him grinding his teeth in his sleep. Siegel tries to expose this to Dr. Tolman, but the paranoia has taken over so much that Tolman won't listen to the evidence.|$|R
50|$|The threads {{are then}} {{switched}} {{back into the}} space between the index and middle fingers by holding the threads between the thumb and the side of the index finger. This is repeated rhythmically, creating a louder <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> than the quiet method. Another method is to hold all of the worry beads in one hand and roll them against each other, creating soft clicking sounds.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{echolocation}} {{was once}} used to separate Aerodramus from the non-echolocating genera Collocalia and Hydrochous (virtually nothing {{is known about}} Schoutedenapus). But recently, the pygmy swiftlet Collocalia troglodytes was discovered making similar <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> in and outside its cave. Characteristics of behavior, such as what materials other than saliva the nests contain, {{can be used to}} differentiate between certain species of Aerodramus.|$|R
50|$|He {{taught himself}} {{echolocation}} {{at the age}} of five. He was able to detect the location of objects by making frequent <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> with his tongue. This case was explained in 20/20: Medical Mysteries. He used it to accomplish such feats as running, playing basketball, riding a bicycle, rollerblading, playing football, and skateboarding. Underwood's childhood eye doctor claimed that Underwood {{was one of the most}} proficient human echolocators.|$|R
50|$|Holding {{the fingers}} and hand {{perpendicular}} to the strings may cause other difficulties. Since the string is aligned with the groove between fingertip and nail: this may cause <b>clicking</b> <b>noises</b> or double sounds (fingertip sound, then nail sound). By holding the fingers and hand to the left, {{it is impossible for}} the string to land in the groove, since {{the left side of the}} nail will touch the string first.|$|R
50|$|A popper float, {{commonly}} called a 'popping cork' {{is designed to}} mimic a large fish feeding at the surface with rod action. There are different styles of popper floats, some use a metal wire with beads at each end to make a <b>clicking</b> <b>noise</b> when pulled through the water, while floats with concave tops make more of a chugging sound. Some also have metal pellets inside, designed to mimic bait fish jumping at the surface.|$|R
