Using the queue theory of an M/G/ 1 model, which has a simpler theoretical formula than that of a GI/G/ 1 model, to compare the cycle time between the two models. The performance of <b>rotary</b> <b>rack</b> systems are evaluated design of experiment to find the significant factor, by analyzing the inter-relationship between the conveyor speed, the vertical and horizontal speeds of the <b>rotary</b> <b>rack,</b> thresholds, and the arrival rate using an L 18 orthogonal array. Next, the factors that affect the cycle time of <b>rotary</b> <b>rack</b> systems are analyzed by using the Taguchi method to find the optimal factor and analyze its sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we analyse the {{performance}} of an automated Work-In-Process (WIP) storage system consisting of a conveyor and a <b>rotary</b> <b>rack.</b> The stability condition and the expected storage cycle time are derived to analyse {{the performance}} of the WIP storage system. As part of the storage cycle time analysis, the derived expected waiting times at the conveyor and the <b>rotary</b> <b>rack</b> are important performance measures {{that can be used for}} buffer-sizing purpose in such systems. Given the fixed storage space of the <b>rotary</b> <b>rack,</b> we also develop a heuristic approach to determine the near optimum 'shape' of the <b>rotary</b> <b>rack</b> so that the expected storage cycle time is minimized. Numerical results are presented to examine the storage cycle time model and the proposed shape design. The analytical model introduces a simple approach over simulation with acceptable accuracy; it is useful when designing such WIP storage systems. Moreover, it can be expanded to model more complex systems. The derived model also provides insightful information on the design parameters that a typical simulation tool can hardly provide...|$|E

40|$|Carousel {{conveyors}} (also known {{simply as}} “carousels”) are an important and well-known type of material handling system used in warehousing and manufacturing to store/retrieve small-to-medium-sized parts. A traditional multi-tier (or multi-level) carousel, which {{is powered by a}} single drive, rotates as a whole unit, and brings the items to the input/output point one at a time, since each level cannot be rotated independently. A special type of carousel (also known as a “rotary rack”) uses a dedicated drive for each level of the carousel. This allows each level of the carousel to rotate independently of and concurrently with the other levels. It also allows a <b>rotary</b> <b>rack</b> to support multiple pickers (or robots) while a traditional carousel can support typically only one picker. Although rotary racks have been available for quite some time, questions about their performance and efficient use remain largely unanswered, especially in comparison with traditional carousels, which {{have been the subject of}} numerous studies. Assuming one or more picking robots, in this paper we use a simulation model to develop and analyze four retrieval strategies for a <b>rotary</b> <b>rack.</b> We compare the performance of the four strategies as a function of the input data and the number of robots in the system. We also address the question of the appropriate number of robots. As one would expect, the simulation results indicate that the throughput of the system increases with the number of robots. However, more robots also lead to more idle time per robot. We show the tradeoff between the expected time required to process an order and the expected idle time per robot...|$|E

40|$|Neutron {{activation}} analysis (NAA) offers excellent sensitivities that {{are superior to}} other analytical techniques in performing identification and quantitative elemental analysis. The technique involves the irradiation of samples and the detection of gamma energies emitted from the isotopes formed from the process of neutron capture. Most NAA were done by comparison method, which is found to have high errors due to {{the differences in the}} matrix composition of sample as well as comparator. The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate an alternative technique of {{activation analysis}} based on absolute gamma ray measurements and the direct calculation of elemental concentrations from reaction rates equation of neutron capture process. The efficiency of the gamma-ray spectrometer as well as the neutron spectrum parameters, thermal and epithermal neutron flux at four characterized irradiation position of 10, 22, 27, and 31 in the <b>rotary</b> <b>rack</b> 1 -MW TRIGA reactor at Malaysia Nuclear Agency was determined. The accuracy and precision of this absolute NAA technique were verified by analyzing two certified reference materials, Soil- 1 and Soil- 7 provided by IAEA. The experimental results for both the materials irradiated at the four characterized irradiation positions were found to be in good agreement with the certified values. The average Z-score for the concentration values were below two signified that the concentration results were accepted for most elements. In conclusion, the proposed technique can be applied for many of future activation analyses with high accuracy without having to rely on the availability of standard samples...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} study the capability of the neutron activation analysis absolute method by using PUSPATI TRIGA Mark II research reactor, at the Malaysia Nuclear Agency (NM). Most of the quantitative measurements of neutron activation analysis (NAA) were done through comparative method, which {{was found to have}} high degree of errors due to the differences in the matrix. NAA based on absolute method is a more direct analysis of the irradiated samples based on (n, ?) reaction rate without using any standard or comparator. In this study the reaction rate of (n, ?) was adopted based on the Høgdahl conventions as well as Westcott formalism. This technique requires absolute gamma ray measurements and neutron spectrum parameters for the calculation of weights or concentrations of elements present in the sample. The neutron spectrum parameters such as epithermal neutron flux shape factor (a), thermal to epithermal neutron flux ratio (f), and thermal and epithermal neutron flux (fth and fepi) were determined at 40 irradiation positions of the <b>rotary</b> <b>rack</b> (RR) as well as at one location of pneumatic transfer system (PTS). The value of a in 40 RR was found to be in the range of 0. 0060 to 0. 1170 with an average of 0. 0172 and 0. 0028 at PTS. The f parameter ranged from 14. 74 to 30. 26 with an average value of 19. 00 at 40 RR, while at PTS the value was 15. 00. The results of fth and fepi at 40 RR were found to be in the range from 0. 87 × 1012 to 2. 55 × 1012 n cm- 2 s- 1 and from 0. 41 × 1011 to 1. 37 × 1011 n cm- 2 s- 1, respectively. The average values of fth and fepi were 2. 17 × 1012 n cm- 2 s- 1 and 1. 16 × 1011 n cm- 2 s- 1 respectively, and at PTS with value of 3. 89 × 1012 n cm- 2 s- 1 for fth and 2. 59 × 1011 n cm- 2 s- 1 for fepi. In addition, the spectral index parameter (r ?? ? Tn /T 0) was determined at 40 RR and PTS based on Westcott formalism. The average value was found as 0. 0550 at RR and 0. 0493 at PTS. The accuracy and precision of the proposed method were investigated by analyzing CRMs Soil- 7, SL- 1, IAEA- 313, IAEA- 312, NBS 1633 A, USGS STM- 1 and MAG- 1 standard samples. The results showed a good agreement with the values reported in certificate with Z-score within 0 < |Z|< 2. Moreover, CRMs Soil- 7, NBS 1633 A and MAG- 1 were analysed for relative method, and the results were found to be in good agreement with certified values. However, the results were slightly less than the results obtained by absolute method. Finally, the absolute NAA method was applied to determine the elemental concentration of U, Th and rare earth elements in rock samples based on Høgdahl convention except for Eu and Lu which were determined based on Westcott formalism. All samples were also analysed using relative method for comparison with the results obtained by absolute method. The deviations of both methods in most cases were found to be less than 10 %...|$|E
