50|$|The {{building}} {{constructed in}} 1910 as the Cathedral of All Saints is a brick American Gothic Revival church. The plans as designed by Alfred Grindle followed the English collegiate style layout with a chancel nearly {{as long as}} the nave. Due to funding restrictions, only the nave and crossing were constructed according to the plans. A wooden structure served as the chancel, significantly limiting the architectural impact of the building. By the late 1950s this clapboard annex was structurally unsound, and a new brick apse and sacristy designed by the firm Evans Woollen and Associates replaced the old chancel. The curved wall of the new apse contrasts greatly with the rectilinear rigidity of the Gothic nave. This dissonance is viewed by many as a stylistic strength of the building in its blending of hard and soft architectural forms. Acoustically, the curved apse wall promotes dissemination and <b>reverberation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> creating a space much noted for its use in musical performance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn large rooms, {{where many}} people gather such as atria, food courts or restaurants, {{relatively}} high noise levels can occur, due to so called “Lombard effect”. The “Lombard effect” is a reflex of vocal chords {{that relates to}} changes of the voice characteristics in noisy background. Typically an increase of the vocal intensity, the fundamental voice frequency, and the word duration will occur. Noise levels in an enclosed place are influenced {{not only by the}} amount and character of sound sources present, but also by the overall <b>reverberation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in the space. This article deals with the investigation of the acoustic conditions in three large gathering places covered by glass and foils. We focus on the investigation of the influence of the amount and position of sound absorption in atria on their reverberation time and on the occurrence of various sound phenomena, such as flutter echoes, focusing of sound etc. Results of the measurements are used for calibration of acoustical models. Different architectural solutions simulated in ray-based software are compared...|$|E

40|$|During {{abrasive}} blasting, {{the operator}} {{is exposed to}} a process consisting of combined sound pressure levels from compressed air propelling an abrasive media through the hose, the abrasive striking metal substrate, the flow of breathing air inside the helmet, and the <b>reverberation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> inside {{the walls of the}} blast booth. The resulting noise can reach peak sound pressure levels (Lpeak) of 128 dBA, exceeding allowable occupational exposure levels. The objectives of this study were to investigate the noise levels produced during abrasive blasting, attempt to further quantify total noise exposure to the abrasive blast operator, and calculate combined attenuation provided by the abrasive blasting helmets and hearing protection devices. The attenuation provided by the helmets alone was directly measured during abrasive blasting operations through personal dosimetry. The attenuation provided by the helmets when used in combination with hearing protection devices was determined by applying measured attenuation data from the helmets to the attenuation data provided by hearing protection device manufacturers. Findings of the study revealed that noise levels inside the blast booth were above the OSHA permissible exposure level while noise levels inside the helmets were attenuated to within allowable levels largely on account of helmet construction. Combined attenuation provided by the helmet and hearing protection device was significant enough to reduce noise exposure to below the occupational exposure limit of 90 dBA...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, many open-plan {{houses have}} been {{proposed}} not only for comfort reasons, {{but also as a}} place to engage in family life. However, in contrast to the fact that this kind of plan makes it easy for people to interact, the daily life household sounds that occur inside the home may be perceived as noise. It is especially difficult to suppress the propagation of sound and reverberation in staircase and stairwell areas due to the absence of sound-absorbing furniture. In this study, we focused on addressing sound management within the staircase area in open-plan housing where sound absorption is particularly difficult. In order to suppress sound propagation on the upper and lower floors and the <b>reverberation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> we placed a thin sound absorption panel on the wall, ceiling, and riser of the staircase. As a result, we were able to confirm that the propagation of sound on upper and lower floors can be suppressed by carrying out the sound absorption treatment on the staircase. Furthermore, we found that in stairway landing areas, the suppression effect of the propagation of sound varies depending on the position of the sound source and the positioning of the sound absorption panel, {{and that there is a}} position for placing the sound absorption panel where the sound-absorbing effect is effective...|$|E
40|$|Geoacoustic {{properties}} of the seabed have a controlling role in the propagation and <b>reverberation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in shallow-water environments. Several techniques are available to quantify the important properties but are usually unable to adequately sample the region of interest. In this paper, we explore the potential for obtaining geotechnical properties from a process-based stratigraphic model. Grain-size predictions from the stratigraphic model are combined with two acoustic models to estimate sound speed with distance across the New Jersey continental shelf and with depth below the seabed. Model predictions are compared to two independent sets of data: 1) Surficial sound speeds obtained through direct measurement using in situ compressional wave probes, and 2) sound speed {{as a function of}} depth obtained through inversion of seabed reflection measurements. In water depths less than 100 m, the model predictions produce a trend of decreasing grain-size and sound speed with increasing water depth as similarly observed in the measured surficial data. In water depths between 100 and 130 m, the model predictions exhibit an increase in sound speed that was not observed in the measured surficial data. A closer comparison indicates that the grain-sizes predicted for the surficial sediments are generally too small producing sound speeds that are too slow. The predicted sound speeds also tend to be too slow for sediments 0. 5 - 20 m below the seabed in water depths greater than 100 m. However, in water depths less than 100 m, the sound speeds between 0. 5 - 20 -m subbottom depth are generally too fast. There are several reasons for the discrepancies including the stratigraphic model was limited to two dimensions, the model was unable to simulate biologic processes responsible for the high sound-speed shell material common in the model area, and incomplete geological records necessary to accurately predict grain-siz...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} explore and learn the {{surrounding}} environment is a major precondition for autonomous systems and applications includ- ing Human-Robot Interaction. Robot audition is particularly useful in situations where visual sensors suffer from limited Field of View or object occlusions.

40|$|Our human {{propensity}} to label and thereby accord meaning to {{experience is a}} means of demystifying the unknown, since to name a sensation allows us to negotiate its power and influence within our lives. Words; however, can be far from innocuous, {{as in the case of}} the term Black Dog. Separately, the words that constitute the phrase can pack a considerable punch; combined, they invoke a different and even richer dimension, having been used by writers, poets and even politicians like Abraham Lincoln and, in recent times, Winston Churchill, to represent the physical and emotional state of depression to which humans can so readily succumb. Any study of language; however, automatically reveals that it is in a constant state of flux, moulding itself to the crevices, contours and inclinations of human expression. To explore then the evolution of language, we are struck by the fact that the nuances that govern all manner of modern rhetoric today are very distant from the grunts, guttural remarks and gesticulations that in a caveman’s tongue would have given texture and tone to experience. At a fundamental level, philosophers and linguists alike have long pondered “whether the links between language forms (words) and their referents (meanings) reflect some sort of natural, objective reality, or are merely the result of convention, associations created by a particular culture and/or language. ” 2 According to Plato (427 – 327), the names ascribed to objects were drawn from a wellspring of intention – they were meant to be so.

40|$|Sound is {{the most}} {{efficient}} radiation in the ocean. <b>Sounds</b> <b>of</b> seismic and biological origin contain information regarding the underlying processes that created them. A single hydrophone records summary time-frequency information from the volume within acoustic range. Beamforming using a hydrophone array additionally produces azimuthal estimates <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> sources. A two-dimensional array and acoustic focusing produce an unambiguous two- dimensional `image' of sources. This dissertation describes the application of these techniques in three cases. The first utilizes hydrophone arrays to investigate T-phases (water-borne seismic waves) in the Philippine Sea. Ninety T-phases were recorded over a 12 -day period, implying {{a greater number of}} seismic events occur than are detected by terrestrial seismic monitoring in the region. Observation of an azimuthally migrating T-phase suggests that <b>reverberation</b> <b>of</b> such <b>sounds</b> from bathymetric features can occur over megameter scales. In the second case, single hydrophone recordings from coral reefs in the Line Islands archipelago reveal that local ambient reef sound is spectrally similar to sounds produced by small, hard-shelled benthic invertebrates in captivity. Time- lapse photography of the reef reveals an increase in benthic invertebrate activity at sundown, consistent with an increase in sound level. The dominant acoustic phenomenon on these reefs may thus originate from the interaction between a large number of small invertebrates and the substrate. Such sounds could be used to take census of hard-shelled benthic invertebrates that are otherwise extremely difficult to survey. A two-dimensional 'map' <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> production over a coral reef in the Hawaiian Islands was obtained using two-dimensional hydrophone array in the third case. Heterogeneously distributed bio-acoustic sources were generally co-located with rocky reef areas. Acoustically dominant snapping shrimp were largely restricted to one location within the area surveyed. This distribution of sources could reveal small-scale spatial ecological limitations, such as the availability of food and shelter. While array-based passive acoustic sensing is well established in seismoacoustics, the technique is little utilized in the study <b>of</b> ambient biological <b>sound.</b> With the continuance of Moore's law and advances in battery and memory technology, inferring biological processes from ambient sound may become a more accessible tool in underwater ecological evaluation and monitorin...|$|R

The author, on board the two boat trawler, the Tôkaimaru, # 33 (belonging to the Taiyô Gyogyô Co.) during the period from 25 th Dec., 1963 to 5 th Jan., 1964, made a preliminary research on trawling of shrimp (Kôraiebi, Penaeus orientalis, commercial named Taishôebi), from the standpoint of the user of a fishfinder. The details of catch per haul of trawl and plankton nets were shown in Table 1. In this research, the author observed as follows. 1. The reflection loss of Kôraiebi ♀× 5, full length 22 - 24 cm, (see Fig. 2) was 38 db. 2. The scattering layers (SL) showed remarkable journal migration, but lower SL near the sea bed showed little migration. 3. After his 17 hauls of 7. 5 cm plankton nets, the author did not prove organisms of SL and supposed that the origin of SL was not only plankton (Schizopoda, Copepoda, Amphipoda, Sagitta and etc.) and marine snow as shown in Fig. 12, but also distinct zone of temperature and salinity of the sea water and exceptionally SL near the sea bed might be by muddy water disturbed by trawl nets. 4. On the 50 KC echogram, the number of single traced at the coverage depth of trawl net was also in substantial agreement with the number of fish caught per haul at the rate of water volume covered by trawl net and echo beam, but on the 200 KC echogram, it was very difficult to estimate such a relation, as it catches too sensitively, the reverberation from any scatters in the sea water.
