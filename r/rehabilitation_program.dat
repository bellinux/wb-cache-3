The FAO emergency relief and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> is assisting vulnerable returnee populations in the African Great Lakes Region through mass propagation and distribution of CMD resistant or highly tolerant cassava.|$|E

While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness and tingling in his hand so he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to whether he would be able to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the tingling sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.|$|E

5|$|Unpredictable traffic {{congestion}} and its functionally obsolete design make the Skyway {{one of the}} most unreliable roads in the United States. , the bridges handle about 74,000crossings per day, none of which were by trucks since they had been barred from the road in 1934.

40|$|AIMS: Cardiac <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs</b> {{develop in}} {{accordance}} with guidelines, but also in response to local needs and resources. This study evaluated features of Ontario cardiac <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs</b> {{in accordance with}} guidelines, emerging evidence and treating underserved populations. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, all Ontario cardiac <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs</b> were mailed an investigator-generated survey. Responses were received from 38 of 45 (84. 4 %) programs. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (71. 1 %) cardiac <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs</b> were located within a hospital. Twenty-four (63. 2 %) programs reported that they offer two sessions of exercise and education per week. Twenty-six (68. 4 %) programs offered an alternative model of program delivery other than on-site, with 10 (27. 0 %) programs reporting they tailored their programs to rural patients. Twenty-three (62. 2 %) programs provided services to patients with a noncardiac primary indication. Twenty-six (68. 4 %) programs systematically screened patients for depressive symptoms. Twenty-seven (71. 1 %) offered resources to patients postgraduation. CONCLUSION: Most cardiac <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs</b> offered alternative models of care, such as home-based rehabilitation. Cardiac rehabilitation sites are well integrated within their community, enabling smooth postcardiac rehabilitation transitions for patients. Cardiac <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs</b> continue to offer proven comprehensive components, while simultaneously attempting to adapt {{to meet the needs}} of patients with other chronic diseases.

Methods of measuring problem awareness and treatment readiness are discussed along with possible methods of intervention, including the Pennebaker method. <br /...|$|R
5|$|Yet {{the band}} members' drug {{problems}} still stood in their way. In 1986, Tyler completed a successful drug <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program,</b> after an intervention by his fellow band members, a doctor, and manager Tim Collins, {{who believed that}} the band's future would not be bright if Tyler did not get treated. The rest of the band members also completed drug rehab programs {{over the course of}} the next couple of years. According to the band's tell-all autobiography, Collins pledged in September 1986 he could make Aerosmith the biggest band in the world by 1990 if they all completed drug rehab. Their next album was crucial because of the commercial disappointment of Done With Mirrors, and as the band members became clean, they worked hard to make their next album a success.|$|E
5|$|A <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> often {{involves}} {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, Richard {{pitched in}} a single spring training game and then went into extended spring training in Sarasota, Florida, {{during the first two}} months of the season. There he registered three wins and two losses and a 3.38ERA in seven starts with thirty-two total innings. Afterwards, he joined the major league <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> with the Daytona Beach Astros of the Florida State League. In his six starts, Richard notched three wins, two complete games and posted a 2.79ERA. He was then promoted to Triple-A baseball with the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League. He struggled to control the ball, conceding a high number of runs to opposing teams. He took a loss on August 12 against the Phoenix Giants and on August 27 against the Salt Lake City Gulls in a 13–0 rout. His longest outing as a starter—more than five innings—was an appearance against the Giants in the last game of the season on September 1. He then joined the Astros' extended roster but did not play in any games.|$|E
5|$|World War I caused several {{changes at}} the school. During the {{conflict}} and for some time afterwards, Georgia Tech hosted a school for cadet aviators, supply officers, and army technicians. Tech also started a Reserve Officer Training Corps unit; {{the first in the}} Southern United States, it became a permanent addition to the school. World War I affected the school academically as well: the United States government asked for and financed an automotive school for army officers, a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> for disabled soldiers, and a geology department. Federal aid also helped to establish Tech's Industrial Education Department, courtesy of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917. The war also placed on hold extensive fundraising efforts for a new power plant, and made it difficult to find engineers willing to teach at the school; Matheson toured Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and MIT in 1919 but failed to secure a single hire, as none of the students wished to work for such low wages.|$|E
