40|$|Abstract—Cognitive Radio (CR) {{networks}} allow {{users to}} opportunistically transmit in the licensed spectrum bands, {{as long as}} the performance of the Primary Users (PUs) of the band is not degraded. Consequently, variation in spectrum availability with time and periodic spectrum sensing undertaken by the CR users have a pronounced effect on the higher layer protocol performance, such as at the transport layer. This paper investigates the limitations of classical TCP newReno in a CR ad hoc network environment, and proposes TCP CRAHN, a window-based TCP-friendly protocol. Our approach incorporates spectrum awareness by a combination of explicit feedback from the intermediate nodes and the destination. This is achieved by adapting the classical TCP rate control algorithm running at the source to closely interact with the physical layer channel information, the link layer functions of spectrum sensing and buffer management, and a predictive mobility framework that is developed at the network layer. An analysis of the expected throughput in TCP CRAHN is provided, and simulation results reveal significant improvements by using our approach. To the best of our knowledge, our approach takes the first steps toward the design of a transport layer for CR ad hoc networks.

However, this will impose extra burden on network traffic control {{as a result}} of fre-quent handover behavior. Existing approaches to support a high handover rate still have cell loss and cell out-of-sequence penalty while the handover is in progress. This paper proposes a novel handover protocol that can avoid cell loss and guarantee cell sequence. It can enhance the perfor-mance of a microcellular asynchronous transfer mode network. By multicasting cells to a new base station before handover, our scheme can avoid cell loss and support a nonoverlapping microcell environment as well. The multicast of signaling messages during handover is to coordinate the cell transmission order between the old base station and the new base station to guarantee cell sequence. A formal representation of the handover protocol using finite-state diagrams has been developed to specify and verify the protocol.

The evaluation of the perceived quality of service (PQoS) is based on the well-known VQM objective metric, a powerful technique which is highly correlated to the more expensive and time consuming subjective metrics. Currently, PQoS is used only for offline analysis after delivery of the entire video content. Thanks to the proposed simple model, we can estimate in real time the video PQoS and we can rapidly adapt the content transmission through scalable video coding and bit rates in order to offer the best perceived quality to the end users. The designed model has been validated through many different measurements in realistic wireless environments using an ad hoc WiFi test bed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract?Multi-hop {{propagation}} of situational information is a promising technique for improving beaconing performance {{and increasing the}} degree of situational awareness onboard vehicles. A possible way of achieving this is by piggyback information on the beacon packets that are sent periodically by each vehicle in the network, as prescribed by the DSRC and ETSI standards. However, prescribed limitations on beacon size imply that only information about {{a very small number}} of surrounding vehicles can be piggybacked in a beacon packet. In most traffic situations, this number is well below the typical number of vehicles within transmission range, implying that multi-hop forwarding strategies must be devised to select which neighboring vehicle?s information to include in a transmitted beacon. In this paper, we designed different multi-hop forwarding strategies, and assessed their effectiveness in delivering fresh situational information to surrounding vehicles. Effectiveness is estimated in terms of both information age and probability of experiencing a potentially dangerous situational-awareness blackout. Both metrics are estimated as a function of the hop distance from the transmitting vehicle, and in presence of different level of <b>radio</b> channel <b>congestion.</b> The investigation is based on extensive simulations whose multi-hop communication performance is corroborated by real-world measurements. The results show that network-coding based strategies substantially improve forwarding performance as compared to a randomized strategy, reducing the average information age of up to 60 %, and the blackout probability of up to two orders of magnitude. We also consider the effect of multi-hop {{propagation of}} situational information on the reliability of a forward collision warning application, and show that network-coding based propagation yields a factor three improvement of reliability with respect to arandomized forwarding strategy, and even higher improvements with respect to the case of no propagation...|$|R
