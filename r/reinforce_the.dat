5|$|A ceasefire order reached Crummel on 2November, {{upon which}} {{he and his men}} {{returned}} to Batavia after stationing a contingent of 50 men at Cadouwang. When he arrived at noon there were no more Chinese stationed at the walls. On 8 November the Sultanate of Cirebon sent between 2,000 and 3,000 native troops to <b>reinforce</b> <b>the</b> city guard. Looting continued until at least 28November, and the last native troops stood {{down at the end of}} that month.|$|E
5|$|A {{squadron}} of three galleys under Antonio Diedo arrived to <b>reinforce</b> <b>the</b> city on 17 March, but to little avail. A muster of the city's available defenders showed that they sufficed to man {{only one in}} two or three crenelles, and they were deficient in both armament and morale: news of Murad's approach at the head of an army rumoured to number 190,000 men caused widespread terror among the populace.|$|E

5|$|After commissioning, Handy and Hearty were renamed Harvester and Hesperus, respectively, {{to avoid}} {{confusion}} with Hardy. The Havant-class destroyers initially formed the 9th Destroyer Flotilla assigned to Western Approaches Command for anti-submarine patrols and escort duty.

5|$|After the Munich Agreement, two tank battalions {{were sent}} to <b>reinforce</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Mobile Division in Slovakia.

5|$|Although the {{entrance}} to the pass had been secured by a regiment, the remainder of the 10th Cavalry Brigade did not <b>reinforce</b> <b>the</b> regiment. The brigade commander, Brigadier General Richard Howard-Vyse had disobeyed divisional orders to do so and when the brigade finally advanced, twice got lost. In consequence, Barrow, the commander of the 4th Cavalry Division, relieved Howard-Vyse of his command on the spot. Lieutenant Colonel W. G. K. Green of the Jacob's Horse took command of the brigade.|$|E

5|$|As the reconstituted Central Bank of Somalia fully assumes its {{monetary}} policy responsibilities, {{some of the}} existing money transfer companies are expected {{in the near future}} to seek licenses so as to develop into full-fledged commercial banks.

5|$|As {{the second}} day dawned, the 9th SS Panzer Division {{continued}} to <b>reinforce</b> <b>the</b> German blocking line. Krafft's unit withdrew overnight and joined Spindler's line, coming under his command. Spindler's force was now becoming so large as more men and units arrived at the new front, that {{he was forced to}} split it into two battle groups: Kampfgruppes Allworden and Harder. The defensive line now blocked the entire western side of Arnhem and had closed the gap exploited by Frost alongside the river the previous evening.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{compatibility}} {{and mechanical}} property of {{two kinds of}} synthetic fibers to geopolymer were studied. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polypropylene (PP) were used as <b>reinforcing</b> fiber materials. <b>The</b> result shows that flexural strength of geopolymer is obviously increased by mixed with reinforcing fiber. PVA is better than PP in <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> flexural strength, both of these fibers have no significant effect in <b>reinforcing</b> <b>the</b> compressive strength to geopolymer...|$|R

5|$|At 04:00 on 19 May, an NVA platoon {{attacked}} Company H 2/3 Marines {{position on}} Route 9 southeast of Khe Sanh killing 3 Marines {{for the loss}} of 8 dead. Simultaneously Company I 3/4 Marines on Hill 552 was hit by NVA mortar fire, at dawn the Marines attacked the NVA position killing 42 and capturing 4. At 07:10 a platoon from Company F 2/1 Marines supported by 2 tanks on a road sweep operation from KSCB towards Route 9 was ambushed, the Marines attempted to assault the NVA positions but were repulsed. The remainder of Company F was sent to <b>reinforce</b> <b>the</b> platoon but the Marines attack was again repulsed, Company G was then sent to reinforce Company F and napalm strikes were called in close to the Marine lines forcing the NVA to retreat. Marine losses were 8 dead while NVA losses were 113 killed and 3 captured. Given the increased NVA activity around KSCB, in late May III MAF ordered 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines (3/9 Marines) to <b>reinforce</b> <b>the</b> units in the area.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata, {{the seventh}} {{work in his}} chorale cantata cycle, in seven movements: two framing choral movements, a recitative and an unusual sequence of four bipartite arias. He scored the work for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of a horn to <b>reinforce</b> <b>the</b> hymn tune in the outer movements, two transverse flutes, two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo. It is the only known work from his chorale cantata cycle that kept the original words unchanged.|$|E

During the 1980s and 1990s, several studies were conducted to examine morphological differences among the breed lines.
