The emperor penguin {{is the only}} penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adélie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The southern <b>rockhopper</b> <b>penguin</b> has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes.

5|$|Molecular clock {{evidence}} using DNA {{suggests the}} macaroni penguin split from its closest relative, the royal penguin (Eudyptes schlegeli), around 1.5million years ago. Although {{the two have}} generally been considered separate species, the close similarities of their DNA sequences has led some, such as the Australian ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles, to treat the royal as a subspecies of the macaroni. The two species are very similar in appearance, although the royal penguin has a white face instead of the usually black face of the macaroni. Interbreeding with the Indo-Pacific subspecies of the southern <b>rockhopper</b> <b>penguin</b> (E. chrysocome filholi) has been reported at Heard and Marion Islands, with three hybrids recorded there by a 1987–88 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rockhopper</b> <b>penguins</b> are {{carnivorous}} birds, {{and they}} survive on marine animals. Primarily, the rockhopper penguin’s diet consists of krill and small crustaceans, which may include crabs, lobsters, crayfish, or shrimp. They also hunt larger organisms like squid and myctophid fish. <b>Rockhopper</b> <b>penguins</b> eat more krill {{than they do}} fish; their diet changes when they migrate and as the seasons change. <b>Rockhopper</b> <b>penguins</b> can be at sea for days while hunting. They can dive up to 330 ft for several {{minutes at a time}} while looking for prey.|$|R

Male <b>rockhopper</b> <b>penguins</b> fed at a higher trophic level thanfemales, but macaroni penguins showed no differences between sexes.

After seeing in a vision Marina having a dilemma, Hubie decides to escape with Rocko and flees, before laying low on a beach. Rocko reluctantly tells Hubie about his desire to fly and live in tropical climate. He convinces him to help him return to Antarctica by making up a lie about a flying penguin named Waldo. They have a short fight after Rocko tries to fly off [...] "an authentic, ancient aviarial airstrip" [...] and another after Rocko saved Hubie from a killer whale. Back in Antarctica, Drake begins to threaten Marina for her hand in mating. If Marina refuses, she {{will be forced to}} leave, as it goes against tradition. Hubie and Rocko attempt to depart, but Rocko discovers Hubie lied to him and attempts to attack Hubie, but soon starts laughing, praising Hubie's determination to get back to Marina. Back in Antarctica, Marina becomes worried about Hubie. Hubie and Rocko run into the hungry and persistent leopard seal but are able to escape it. With that they become true friends (though it takes prodding from Hubie for Rocko to admit it). Their joy is short-lived as three killer whales attack them causing Hubie's pebble to get lost in the scuffle and Rocko to go missing, leaving Hubie to think he perished.|$|E

The subspecies E. c. chrysocome, which may be referred to the true southern subspecies, reproduces at offshore islands in southern Chile, Argentina and at the Falkland Islands.
