5000|$|The {{introduction}} of run-flat tires and emergency spare tires by several tire and vehicle manufacturers has motivated {{to make at}} least some basic TPMS mandatory when using run-flat tires. With run-flat tires, the driver will most likely not notice that a tire is running flat, hence the so-called [...] "run-flat warning systems" [...] were introduced. These are most often first generation, purely roll-radius based iTPMS, which ensure that run-flat tires are not used beyond their limitations, usually 80 km/h (49.7 mph) and 80 km (49.7 miles) driving distance. The iTPMS market has progressed as well.

A realistic {{finite element model}} is proposed to overcome some of the existing shortcomings in simulation of deep rolling. Deep rolling coverage is defined, formulated and incorporated into the simulation. The model is validated by the experimental measurements.

However, extremely high coverage can deteriorate the performance of deep rolled components.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand of reducing the body weight of automobiles, the utilization of advanced high strength steel has increased dramatically in recent years. However, high residual stress and redundant strain caused by the traditional cold roll forming process is still an outstanding problem. Under such circumstances, the Chain-die forming method is developed as a novel sheet metal forming approach which combines roll forming and stamping processes. A Chain-die former employs discrete die blocks which run on a chain track with significant virtual <b>roll</b> <b>radius,</b> simulating a roll forming process. Meanwhile, individual pairs of die blocks deform the sheet metal gradually acting as a stamping process. Through the enlargement of virtual <b>roll</b> <b>radius,</b> the peak longitudinal strain developed during the forming process is dramatically decreased (contained in the elastic region), leading to significantly reduced residual stress and almost no redundant deformation. Due to low longitudinal strain, the cross-sections of the product {{can be considered as}} a plane strain state throughout the entire forming process, allowing utilization of 2 -D plane strain simulations to represent for 3 -D simulations. In this paper, using 2 -D FE stamping simulations and 3 -D FE Chain-die forming simulations in assisting die design for a Chain-die formed threshold product using AHSS material is discussed. The results show 2 -D stamping simulations are able to predict the average forming angles of 3 -D simulation results with high accuracy and much higher efficiency. In the initial tooling design process, 2 -D stamping models should be employed to design the tooling geometry in order to compensate the springback effect, followed by 3 -D Chain-die forming models validating the 2 -D design and providing additional information such as variation of the flange angle along the longitudinal direction and the longitudinal bow condition. The findings can be applied in industrial practice which can significantly accelerate the tooling design process for the Chain-die forming method...|$|E

These two trends cooperate toward the development of compliant substrates, which are designed to offload mechanical stress from the active circuit onto the substrate (and encapsulation). Compliant substrates make the circuit particularly rugged against rolling and bending.

40|$|Curvature {{matching}} for 5 -axis {{surface machining}} {{has been plagued}} by the complexity of the task. As a result the current tool positioning strategies are likewise computationally complicated. Gouging the surface has been the main concern and has presented the greatest dif®culty in the algorithms. Some of the methods perform exhaustive searches of the surface to avoid gouging while others incrementally adjust the tool orientation until gouges are no longer detected. In this paper a new positioning strategy is presented that is simple to implement and is not dif®cult to compute. The rolling ball method <b>rolls</b> a variable <b>radius</b> ball along the tool path and positions the cutting tool to cut the rolling ball. A small region of the ball's surface is used to approximate a small region of the surface being machined. The radius of each ball is computed by checking a grid of points {{in the area of the}} surface that the tool casts a shadow for each tool position. A pseudo-radius is computed for each grid point and the most appropriate radius is selected to be the rolling ball's radius. The selection process follows a hierarchy of surface pro®les ranging from convex to concave. Convex, concave, and saddle (mixed) surface regions are all computed in a similar fashion and there are no special cases for which the positioning strategy must be changed to compute a tool position. Local gouge checking is automatically built-in to the positioning computations so that the typical iterative strategy of checking for gouging, then incrementally tilting the tool until no gouges are detected is eliminated. The method is robust and simple to implement and it only requires surface coordinates and surface normals.

30|$|Several factors {{shape the}} tension control design to be challenging, which include {{significant}} parameter variations and disturbances. Small {{variations in the}} change of velocity of the transport rollers can cause significant variations in tension. On the other hand, we used different shapes of mandrels for maintaining the line speed in acceleration or deceleration states. Because of the coupling between the tension and the line speed, {{it is difficult to}} maintain the tension at a desired value. Researchers have investigated considerably for acquiring better control result. Lee et al. [2] used a magneto rheological brake to provide back tension to prevent frequent part changes and fatal malfunction for a tension control system, and a PID controller was designed, and test results showed the feasibility with satisfying the time constant and the allowable error. Nishida et al. [3] divided the transport system into several subsystems and a self-tuning PI controller with an estimator based on a novel adaptive particle swarm optimization method was constructed to solve the strong coupling between the velocity and tension of the web. A self-tuning PID controller to control the tension for tape winding of composites was designed and the constant extension ratio is guaranteed. To reduce the time required for the stabilization of the tension, a faststabilization method [4] for web tension is proposed. The model of dancer system and stabilization of web tension in drying process are established, and the variation of tension is used as a reference value for the tension stabilization. The integration of load cells and active dancer system for printed electronics applications was used to improve the accuracy of web tension, and self-adapting neural network control was proposed to reduce tension spikes due to the change in roll diameter of winder and unwinder rolls. Wu et al. [5] developed a tension detection and control mechanism and analyzed the main causes of wire tension variation, and then a PI algorithm was proposed to reduce tension variation. An accurate dynamic model for the unwind roll by considering the time variation of the <b>roll</b> inertia and <b>radius</b> was developed, and a decentralized controller for computing the equilibrium inputs for each driven roller was proposed [6]. A sliding mode control with guaranteed cost technique [7] was applied for reducing the system uncertainties. The simulation results showed that the proposed method had good robustness and quick response time. Compensation method [8] by calculating the torque of a driven loop lifter was developed to control the tension and thickness of hot-rolled strip. For the control strategy, several control methods have been proposed including disturbance rejection control [9 – 12], neuro-fuzzy control [13 – 16], and H∞ control [17 – 19]. Choi et al. [20] conducted a survey on various types of control algorithms by investigating their strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrated some areas of potential future development.|$|R
