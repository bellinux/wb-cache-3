The 1974 Model was extensively modified with a revised sump and does not suffer from reliability issues.|$|R

2500|$|At {{approximately}} 2:00a.m. (19 {{hours into}} the flight) the center engine on the Bird of Paradise <b>ran</b> <b>rough</b> and quit, causing the aircraft to slowly lose altitude.

The icing had occurred because the heaters for the air intakes had been removed during modifications, as a power conservation measure, when Hegenberger's flight plan did not anticipate encountering temperatures cold enough to require their use. With full power restored, Maitland climbed the Bird of Paradise to , where scattered breaks in the clouds allowed star sightings to be made.|$|R

40|$|Theabilities of four {{species of}} diurnal jumping spiders (Helpis minitabunda,Portia fimbriata, Trite auricoma, and Trite planiceps) and one species of nocturnal clubionid spider (Clubiona cambridgei) to {{maintain}} approximately straight paths by alternating {{turns in the}} absence of visual cues was investigated. Under infra-red light (observed using infra-red video), individual spiders were <b>run</b> <b>rough</b> a maze comprising a single forced turn and then a choice of turning in the same or opposite direction to the forced turn. At the second (free) turn, each species turned in the direction opposite to the forced turn (i. e., alternated turns) more frequently than it turned in the same direction. There was no evidence that species differed in tendency to alternate turns. In nature, jumping spiders may use this ability to navigate {{in the absence of}} visual cues when foraging or escaping predators in darkness. It is suggested that alternation of turns by jumping spiders depends on proprioceptive information gathered during previous turns...|$|R
