50|$|As {{the nominal}} {{point of entry}} to the St. Lawrence River from the sea, Pointe-au-Père has hosted four {{lighthouse}} stations since 1859. A Marconi <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>station</b> was constructed in 1909. Arriving trans-Atlantic liners would unload mail and take on harbour pilots; Pointe-au-Père also provided a hydrographic station and a quarantine post.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radiotelegraph</b> <b>stations</b> {{generally}} comprise: a transmitter, a receiver, {{and one or}} more antennas. The transmitter {{is usually}} controlled manually by a telegraph key. A radiotelegraph channel comprises two stations and a radio wave propagation path between the two stations.|$|R
50|$|Marconi's trans-Atlantic <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>stations</b> were {{deployed}} in pairs; a station near New Brunswick, New Jersey would transmit while another at Belmar would receive the weak signals {{from across the}} Atlantic. American Marconi had also established a factory in 1907 in Aldene, New Jersey.|$|R
5000|$|This pejorative usage {{continued}} into at least 1940, as evidenced in the January 1940 issue of The APCO Bulletin, {{where it was}} written [...] "Rumors of citations by the FCC for violation of the superfluous traffic regulation {{on the part of}} certain of our <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>stations</b> have resulted in a sudden decrease in 'hamming' on the police frequencies...".|$|R
50|$|On 30 March 1927 {{was inaugurated}} in the South Orkney Islands the first <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>station</b> in Antarctica.

50|$|On November 13, 1910 {{the first}} radio message to Africa was sent from a <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>station</b> at Coltano, Italy and {{received}} in Massaua (then {{part of the}} Italian colony of Eritrea). Italy's King Vittorio Emanuele officially opened the station in 1911, at which time messages were sent from Coltano to Glace Bay (Canada) and Massaua.|$|E
50|$|A Marconi <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>station</b> {{had been}} {{operational}} at Delhi, India {{at the time}} the Indian capital had moved there from Calcutta in 1911. Marconi had constructed experimental broadcast transmitters in Calcutta, which were to become 2BZ (Calcutta Radio Club, 1923) and 5AF (West Bengal government); these radio stations operated until the national government established a station in 1927.|$|E

5000|$|In 1907, {{the radio}} {{industry}} had been developing for ten years, however, it had consistently lost money, as {{there had been}} greater than expected difficulties in perfecting the technology needed to become commercially profitable. On land, <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>stations</b> were unable to compete with existing telegraph lines. The main revenue source for the new communications technology was point-to-point radiotelegraphic communication at sea, plus transoceanic links, however, revenues from these sources were still very limited.|$|R
50|$|While Italy {{declared}} war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral. Italy, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>station,</b> tried to forcefully establish a detachment of Carabinieri on its territory and then suspended any telephone connections with the Republic when it did not comply.|$|E

50|$|In mid-1902 the Stone Telegraph and Telephone Company, {{also based}} in Boston, was formed, {{in order to}} begin {{commercial}} operations. Stone acted as Chief Engineer, and two stations separated by sixteen kilometers (ten miles) were constructed at Cambridge and Lynn, Massachusetts. Beginning in 1905, demonstration <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>stations,</b> using spark transmitters and electrolytic detectors, were installed for evaluation by the U.S. Navy. By the end of 1906, the government had purchased five ship and three land installations.|$|R
25|$|The company's most {{important}} early contract was the construction, in 1905–1906, of five high-powered <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>stations</b> for the U.S. Navy, located in Panama, Pensacola and Key West, Florida, Guantanamo, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. It also installed shore stations along the Atlantic Coast and Great Lakes, and equipped shipboard stations. But {{the main focus}} was selling stock at ever more inflated prices, spurred by the construction of promotional inland stations. Most of these inland stations had no practical use and were abandoned once the local stock sales slowed.|$|R
5000|$|Marriott {{was born}} on February 18, 1879 in Richwood, Ohio to Franklin Waters and Minerva Ann (Woodruff) Marriott. He {{attended}} the Ohio State University, where he enrolled in the college's General Science course, majoring in physics. Inspired by reports of Guglielmo Marconi's accomplishments in developing radio communication (then known as [...] "wireless telegraphy"), {{in the spring of}} 1897 he began conducting his own experiments. He left college in February, 1901 to become an Assistant Engineer for the American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company. In October, 1901, he participated in that company's construction of temporary <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>stations</b> that were used, with limited success, to report the results of the International Yacht races held in New York.|$|R
5000|$|In 1919 American Marconi's {{assets were}} {{purchased}} by General Electric and reorganized as the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). From 1921 to 1923 Dreher {{worked as an}} operating engineer at RCA's transatlantic <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>station</b> located at Riverhead, Long Island. In May, 1923, RCA established two showcase broadcasting stations, WJZ (now WABC) and WJY, at [...] "Aeolian Hall" [...] in New York City. Dreher was initially the facility's chief control operator, but was soon was promoted to engineer-in-charge. Drawing on his experiences, he published articles about radio technology and the emerging broadcasting industry, including, beginning in March, 1925, the monthly [...] "As the Broadcaster Sees It" [...] column in Radio Broadcast magazine.|$|E
50|$|During World War I, when Italy {{declared}} war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbor Austrian spies who could be given access to its new <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>station.</b> Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not comply. Two groups of ten volunteers joined Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.|$|E
50|$|The {{central site}} for the radio {{projects}} was established at the Villa Lacoste, located near Brussels {{on the grounds of}} the summer Royal Palace of Laeken. A training school for operators, workshops and a research laboratory were established at this location. Raymond Braillard, a French engineer, was appointed as both the Chief Engineer of the Congo facilities, and the director of the Laeken installations. By the end of 1913 twelve radiotelegraph stations had been established to provide communication throughout the Belgian Congo. That same year also saw completion at Laeken of a high-powered <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>station</b> used for transmissions to the colony. The original site included eight towers 90 to 190 meters tall (300 to 630 feet), supporting the station's transmitting antenna. In the fall of 1913 it was reported that messages were now being successfully transmitted from Laeken to the Belgian Congo capital of Boma.|$|E

5000|$|Turning over a {{communications}} channel {{is the change}} in communications protocol transmission status that occurs when a transmitting station releases transmitting control of {{a communications}} channel thus turning it over to allow another station to transmit. QSK or full break-in operation {{is one of several}} techniques and protocols for turning over control of a Morse code radiotelegraph communications channel. Usually the transmitter of a <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>station</b> is manually controlled by an operator using a telegraph key. QSK is a three-letter code group {{that is one of the}} numerous Morse code three-letter code groups belonging to the venerable International Q-code established for radiotelegraph operators in the first decade of the 1900s. The three letter code group QSK literally means [...] "I can hear you between my signals; you may break in on my transmission." [...] Because of this, full break-in operation is often referred to as QSK operation. Although radiotelegraphy and Morse code is no longer used for commercial or professional purposes it continues to thrive and grow in the amateur radio community hobby. Today's modern era radio amateurs seem to be as interested in so-called full break-in or QSK operation as professional operators were in the early twentieth century.|$|E
50|$|American Marconi also {{branched}} out into some ancillary activities. In 1911, the Wanamaker department stores contracted to have <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>stations,</b> providing two-way communication, installed atop their Philadelphia and New York City stores. The next year a manufacturing plant {{was established in}} Aldene, New Jersey; previously equipment had been imported from Great Britain. Beginning in 1912 the company published a monthly magazine named The Marconigraph, which a year later was expanded and renamed The Wireless Age, and in 1912 it also took over United Wireless' The Aerogram magazine, relaunching it as Ocean Wireless News. One of the more ambitious projects involved tests installing radio communication equipment aboard Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad trains, conducted in 1913. In late 1915 the company announced {{the formation of the}} National Amateur Wireless Association (NAWA), an organization oriented towards amateur radio enthusiasts. NAWA's primary objective at its founding was promoting military preparedness. American Marconi also established a publishing house, Wireless Press, Inc. in 1916, and created the Marconi Institute to provide training for commercial operators.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} Engineering set up, <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>stations</b> may use either a single antenna for both {{transmit}} and receive or, separate transmit and receive antennas. In either case, when receivers are {{operating on the}} same or nearby radio frequencies as used by their associated transmitters, while using the same or nearby antennas, the typical radio receiver is thus exposed to extremely large signals from the nearby transmitter. This situation would generally result in the destruction or degradation of the receiver front end circuitry and would be problematic at best and destructive at worst. As of this writing there has yet apparently been no receiver technology developed that can operate with full sensitivity over such a huge range of received signal levels whilst also safely withstanding the high power levels presented by the associated nearby transmitter. And so receiver inputs cannot simply be bridged across transmitting antenna terminals! Receivers must be isolated from the powerful transmitter signals by some means. These means are provided by the so-called T/R switches.|$|R
50|$|An FCC GROL is {{required}} to adjust, maintain, or internally repair FCC licensed radiotelephone transmitters in the aviation, maritime, and international fixed public radio services. It conveys all of the operating authority of the Marine Radio Operator Permit (MP). It is also required to operate the following: any compulsorily equipped ship radiotelephone station operating with more than 1500 watts of peak envelope power, a voluntarily equipped ship or an aeronautical (including aircraft) stations with more than 1000 watts of peak envelope power. Until 2013, a GROL was required also for international fixed public <b>radiotelegraph</b> and radiotelephone <b>stations,</b> including a HF broadcast station such as the Voice of America, but NOT U.S. based MW stations.|$|R
