500|$|Foreign {{reaction}} was overwhelmingly positive. The New York Times said {{the ceremony was}} [...] "hilariously quirky ... a wild jumble of the celebratory and the fanciful; the conventional and the eccentric; and the frankly off-the-wall." [...] Forbes called it Boyle's [...] "love song to Britain", while Sports Illustrated noted its political aspects, calling it [...] "a celebration of protest and dissent". [...] The Sydney Morning Herald said it was [...] "an unforgettable start ... at once subversive and sublime" [...] and The Times of India said [...] "London presented a vibrant picture of Great Britain's rich heritage and culture." [...] The Chinese news agency Xinhua described the ceremony as [...] "dazzling" [...] and an [...] "eccentric and exuberant celebration of British history, art and culture". Chinese artist Ai Weiwei praised the ceremony for its [...] "human touch", saying [...] "In London, they <b>really</b> <b>turned</b> the ceremony into a party ... such a density of information about events and stories and literature and music; about folktales and movies." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Sonny and Cher's {{music had}} ceased to chart. According to Berman, [...] "the heavy, loud sound of groups like Jefferson Airplane and Cream made the folk-rock music of Sonny and Cher seem too bland." [...] Cher later commented, [...] "I loved the new sound of Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, the electric-guitar {{oriented}} bands. Left to myself, I would have changed with the times because the music <b>really</b> <b>turned</b> me on. But Son didn't like it—and that was that." [...] Their monogamous lifestyle during the period of the sexual revolution and the anti-drug position they adopted {{at the height of the}} drug culture eventually made the duo lose their popular appeal among American youths. According to Bego, [...] "in spite of their revolutionary unisex clothes, Sonny and Cher were quite 'square' when it came to sex and drugs." [...] In an attempt to recapture their young audience, the duo produced and starred in the film Good Times (1967), which was commercially unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|... "Take It Off" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha, {{alongside}} Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly. It was recorded at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, and at Dr. Luke's studio in that city. The song was produced by Luke with vocal editing done by Emily Wright. The main riff of the chorus {{is the same as}} that of The Streets of Cairo, also using a similar rhyme scheme and parallel phrasing. During an interview with Esquire magazine Kesha was asked about her song writing process and used [...] "Take It Off" [...] as an example of how her songs come to fruition. She explained that the song came about when she was out one night and was visiting a transsexual bar, stating, [...] "I have a song [...] called 'Take It Off' about when I went to a drag show, and how <b>really</b> <b>turned</b> on I was by these transvestite men taking clothes off. I was like, What does that even make me?".|$|E

500|$|Before the album's {{commercial}} release, the Beach Boys {{were involved}} in the conception of the Monterey Pop Festival, which was held in June 1967. At the last minute, the band declined to appear at the event. Biographer David Leaf explained: [...] "Monterey was a gathering place for the 'far out' sounds of the 'new' rock, and the Beach Boys in concert really had no exotic sounds (excepting [...] "Good Vibrations") to display. The net result of all this internal and external turmoil was that the Beach Boys didn't go to Monterey, and it is thought that this non-appearance was what <b>really</b> <b>turned</b> the 'underground' tide against them." [...] Publicly, the band said that they couldn't play for reasons pertaining to Carl's military draft, but many of the people involved with the festival thought that the group was simply too scared to compete with the [...] "new music". As author Steven Gaines writes, the decision [...] "had a snowballing effect" [...] that represented [...] "a damning admission that [...] were washed up".|$|E
500|$|Sweet began {{distancing}} {{himself from}} {{other people in the}} Athens music scene and in 1984 quit Oh-OK; by 1985, the Buzz of Delight had broken up. That year, Sweet got a record deal with CBS Records and moved to New York City. He was accused of being opportunistic and using his Athens connections to get a record deal and leave. Sweet maintains that when he went to CBS, he never claimed {{to have anything to do}} with Athens, so that nobody could say he used the town. He says that after months of living in Athens, he realized things weren't as happy there as everyone pretended, and that there was backstabbing going on. In 1993, he said, [...] "Things <b>really</b> <b>turned</b> dark there when R.E.M. got famous, because everyone wanted that fame so bad. Maybe I wanted it too, but I had this musical goal all of my own and wasn't going to go along with the way it was done there." [...] Everybody was telling him that he should be touring and building up a following before doing his record, like R.E.M. had done. However, more than making the record itself and becoming a rock star, Sweet's main motivation was to get money to buy studio gear.|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was <b>really</b> <b>turned</b> into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do when they feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a very}} polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me. I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E

Kelly credited the producers' decision to pair her character with Roy and Hayley Cropper as the moment public support for Becky rose, stating: [...] "The Croppers were the making of Becky, and without them I actually don't think Becky would {{still be in the}} show. The Croppers, especially Roy, were the thing that <b>really</b> <b>turned</b> public opinion [...] around to being positive." [...] Grace Dent of The Guardian commented on Becky's wedding describing her appearance as: [...] " [...] Oil-stained pink princess frock carrying a two litre bottle of street-drinker fuel, shouting football chants, with the words eruditely swapped to honour the groom. Becky's beehive lurched like a detonated high rise, her lip colour swept westward on to her earlobe, a Regal King Size blazed in her gob." [...] With their wedding ruined, Dent commented that although it was karma, they didn't deserve it because [...] "Viewers want Steve and Becky to be together". Telecommunication company Orange state that Becky is well known for [...] "her love of cheap cider and Regal King Size's".|$|E

Four master's degree hopefuls from MIT were seated at a nearby table, fretting at their inability to solve a complex problem which they had been assigned. Never breaking the thread of his own conversation, Ridley abruptly handed the students a notepad he had been scribbling on: [...] "Would this help you any?"

2500|$|The {{crew had}} {{initially}} wanted to script a [...] "Who Shot Paul Robinson?" [...] storyline, {{but due to}} the show's G rating classification in Australia, they could not go through with it. They then settled on the [...] "Who Pushed P.R.?" [...] storyline instead. Bower stated that the storyline had to begin [...] "very, very early", so it could develop and all the suspects that they chose to write into the story were set up. As the storyline was being written, the production team decided to add in Paul's worsening financial situation, which led to him embezzling money from Lassiter's, which then led to new character Diana Marshall (Jane Badler) arriving. Bower commented [...] "it was putting all these pieces together" [...] that <b>really</b> <b>turned</b> the storyline into a proper whodunit.|$|E
2500|$|From mid-1996 Skunkhour {{created a}} new sound, abandoning spoken-word content and {{focusing}} more on melody.

That bassline is just out of control, and I was like, 'God, I {{want to get on}} this'. When Deano pulled out that bassline {{it was like he was}} leading us into battle." [...] By that time Chris Simms had been added to live gigs as a percussionist. Their third album, Chin Chin, which was co-produced by the group with Magoo (Regurgitator), was preceded by its lead single, [...] "Breathing Through My Eyes" [...] in April. Chin Chin was released in July 1997 to critical acclaim and peaked at No.34. The Sun-Heralds Peter Holmes described it as [...] "a massive leap forward" [...] from the [...] "cliched, choppy funk material" [...] of their first two albums, concluding: [...] "Skunkhour's overall feel is heavier, the grooves are deeper and the arrangements a little rockier".|$|E
2500|$|Wilson has said: [...] "The Beatles {{inspired}} me. They didn't influence me." [...] While he was {{enamored with}} Rubber Soul, he explained: [...] "I {{liked the way}} it all went together, {{the way it was}} all one thing. It was a challenge to me... It didn't make me want to copy them but {{to be as good as}} them. I didn't want to do the same kind of music, but on the same level." [...] Carl elaborated: [...] " [...] was Brian's favorite kind of rock; he liked [...] better than the early Beatles stuff. He loved the Beatles' later music when they evolved and started making intelligent, masterful music, but before that Phil was it." [...] According to Mike Love, Carl followed the Beatles more closely than anyone else in the group, but Brian was the most [...] "rattled" [...] by the Beatles, feeling tremendous pressure to [...] "keep pace" [...] with them. Brian once characterized himself as [...] "fucked up" [...] and [...] "jealous" [...] of Spector and the Beatles, saying; [...] "i was flipping out. I couldn't understand how [...] could be just yelled and screamed at. The music they made, 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' for example, wasn't even that great a record, but they just screamed at it." [...] On another occasion, he's said that he was overwhelmed by the [...] "electricity" [...] of their voices on the song ("It <b>really</b> <b>turned</b> me on"). He recalled that he and Love immediately felt threatened by the Beatles and added that he knew the Beach Boys could never match the excitement created by the Beatles as performers, and that this realization led him to concentrate his efforts on trying to outdo them in the recording studio.|$|E
