40|$|Abstract A {{meta-analysis}} of prior studies of techniques de-signed to induce mail survey response rates was conducted. Re-search encompassing 184 effects (study outcomes) in 115 studies (articles) for 17 predictors of {{response rate was}} examined. The average effect size across all manipulations was r =. 065, indicat-ing an average increase of about 6. 5 percent in response rates for manipulations. Effect sizes for specific predictors and two potential moderators of effects were examined. Results indicated that repeated contacts {{in the form of}} preliminary notification and follow-ups, appeals, inclusion of a <b>return</b> envelope, <b>postage,</b> and monetary incentives, were effective in increasing survey re-sponse rates. Significant effect sizes for the predictors ranged from an increase in response of 2 percent to 31 percent. Implica-tions of the results for the conduct of mail surveys and future research on mail survey response behavior are discussed. Researchers have amassed myriad techniques to stimulate mail survey response rates, reduce item omission, speed up response, and reduce response bias.

40|$|Objectives: This {{research}} {{aimed to}} identify older Australian drinkers’ knowledge about Australian Alcohol Guidelines and their {{beliefs about the}} risks and benefits of alcohol; their recall of alcohol-related issues being raised with them by their community pharmacist and General Practitioner (GP); and their receptiveness to alcohol-related information being provided by either health professional. Methods: This research was conducted in Perth, Western Australia. Flyers calling for participants were placed in local health and service centres, and advertisements were placed in local media. Participants who met eligibility requirements were posted a survey pack (n = 190) including an information letter, consent form, quantitative survey, and <b>return</b> addressed, <b>postage</b> paid envelope. 188 people aged over 60 years returned completed questionnaires. Key findings: Women were more familiar with national alcohol guidelines, and were more conservative about the potential health benefits of alcohol. While 90 % of participants were receptive to their GP asking about their alcohol use, only 30 % of men and 20 % of women recalled their GP raising this issue with them in the prior 12 months. Of these, high-risk drinkers were six times more likely than low-risk drinkers to have been asked by their GP. Likewise, 50 % of men and 65 % of women were receptive to having alcohol-related health conversations with their community pharmacist, but less than 4 % recalled their pharmacist raising this issue. Participants were most receptive to receiving information about alcohol-medication interactions. Conclusions: This research highlights that prescribing and dispensing medication represents the ideal opportunity for health professionals to deliver alcohol-related information to older people...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The New South Wales State Government {{recently}} {{proposed a}} trial of the medical use of cannabis. Australians who currently use cannabis medicinally do so illegally and without assurances of quality control. Given the dearth of local information on this issue, this study explored the experiences of medical cannabis users. Methods Australian adults who had used cannabis for medical purposes were recruited using media stories. A total of 147 respondents were screened by phone and anonymous questionnaires were mailed, to be <b>returned</b> by <b>postage</b> paid envelope. Results Data were available for 128 participants. Long term and regular medical cannabis use was frequently reported for multiple medical conditions including chronic pain (57 %), depression (56 %), arthritis (35 %), persistent nausea (27 %) and weight loss (26 %). Cannabis was perceived to provide "great relief" overall (86 %), and substantial relief of specific symptoms such as pain, nausea and insomnia. It was also typically perceived as superior to other medications in terms of undesirable effects, {{and the extent of}} relief provided. However, nearly one half (41 %) experienced conditions or symptoms that were not helped by its use. The most prevalent concerns related to its illegality. Participants reported strong support for their use from clinicians and family. There was almost universal interest (89 %) in participating in a clinical trial of medical cannabis, and strong support (79 %) for investigating alternative delivery methods. Conclusion Australian medical cannabis users are risking legal ramifications, but consistent with users elsewhere, claim moderate to substantial benefits from its use in the management of their medical condition. In addition to strong public support, medical cannabis users show strong interest in clinical cannabis research, including the investigation of alternative delivery methods. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the validity of a sociocultural theory of objectification with a population of older women. Specifically, the study sought to determine if level of self-objectification influenced psychological well-being, disordered eating, and sexual dysfunction. Additional goals of this study included determining if older women self-objectify like their younger counterparts and if level of selfobjectification was influenced by one??????s feminist identity. Participants were 128 randomly selected women living in a small city in the southwest recruited through a local seniors fair and organizations. Participants completed a take-home survey which included a demographic questionnaire, the Feminist Identity Development Scale, the Objectified Body Consciousness Scale, the Scales of Psychological Well-Being Short Form, the Eating Attitudes Test, and the Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women. Participants <b>returned</b> surveys in <b>postage</b> pre-paid envelopes. The data was analyzed using structural equation modeling methods and the final model fit the data well. Results indicate that older women do self-objectify but this level of self-objectification is not influenced by their level of feminist identity. In addition, level of self-objectification is negatively related to psychological well-being and positively related to disordered eating; however, no relationship exists between self-objectification and sexual dysfunction.

Early plans leading to the decision to create a pop music tie-in {{were based on the}} observation that grooved media were at the time primarily used to distribute music, and after an exploratory meeting with the Thompson Twins' management team it was agreed that C&VG could begin organizing the creation of a video game adaptation of the Twins' [...] "Doctor!

Impressed with their work on titles like the 1983 Ant Attack and the 1984 The Snowman, Computer and Video Games approached Rod Cousens and Mark Eyles of Quicksilva, and within a few weeks they had created three alpha-screens (i.e. the game's beach, forest, and cavern scenes). These scenes were presented to the Thompson Twins for approval and the project proceeded to the beta stage. When coding was complete, the Thompson Twins recorded a special introduction message for the game and selected a portion of [...] "Doctor! Doctor!" [...] to be released. Audio material was then recorded along with the Spectrum version of the game data onto a master tape by Flexi Records and this was used to press a metal copy of the disk. The final Spectrum version flexi discs were pressed from the metal master and were attached to the front of C&VG October 1984 issue (Issue 36). As promotional freebies, these copies of the game were used by C&VG to soften the impact of a coinciding magazine price increase from 85p to 95p. By the end of 1984, the C&VG contest associated with the game had ended and the magazine gave readers the opportunity to directly obtain additional copies of the game if they included the <b>return</b> <b>postage</b> (a 13p second class stamp).

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} the health {{needs of people}} with multiple sclerosis living in the Southern Derbyshire region of the UK, using a quality of life postal questionnaire. Methods: This was a population-based survey using a postal questionnaire comprising the 54 -item Multiple Sclerosis Qual-ity of life questionnaire (MSQOL- 54), Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and some additional demo-graphic questions. A postal questionnaire was sent via 40 health practices (50 % of general practitioners) in Southern Derby-shire to all patients diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis confirmed by a neurologist. "Results: Two hundred and one completed questionnaires (from 223 respondents) were <b>returned</b> using pre-paid <b>postage.</b> Respondents were divided into those with mild (41 %), moderate (36 %) and severe (23 %) disability {{on the basis of}} their ADL scores. Seventy seven percent (155) of respondents were women. The POQL mean scores for three groups of mild, moderate and severe disability were 12. 0 ± 2. 8, 9. 5 ± 3. 0, and 8. 0 ± 3. 5 (out of 17), respectively. The regression model showed a relationship between disability scores and POQL scores (Beta= 0. 58, P= 0. 000). Conclusion: For the three groups of disabled people, different priorities emerged in relation to POQL, indicating that ser-vices seeking to improve quality of life in these groups must identify and target the relevant issues appropriately and be sensi-tive to the differing requirements reported by individuals at different levels of disability.

40|$|The Essentials Health Clinic (EHC) was {{established}} to meet {{the unique needs of}} the people of Washington County, made up of a large- migrant population as well as many other citizens with unique healthcare needs. Many of Washington County 2 ̆ 7 s citizens are uninsured or under insured. It is the on going mission of the EHC to not only {{meet the needs of the}} local citizenry but also to provide compassionate and quality care to its patients. As a part of this ongoing process the EHC has been conducting a quality management assessment on a yearly basis. This survey provides the clinic with the tools to compare, analyze, and gather ideas for improvement. The EHC operates only one evening per week. This fact coupled with an all 2 ̆ 7 Volunteer staff makes follow up and continuity of care difficult. This study developed specific clinical guidelines to address the uniqueness of the EHC and to provide a specific framework that will greatly enhance - follow up and continuity of care issues currently facing the EHC. Also an attempt was made to analyze and streamline the use of pre-packaged medicines, provided by Providence Health Systems. Objective: This study has three parts; (1) To conduct a quality management assessment for the EHC and provide updated information concerning its last year of operation. (2) To develop and implement specific clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients with abnormally high blood pressure, abnormally high blood sugar, uncontrolled or poorly controlled asthma, and uncontrolled or poorly controlled gastroesophegal reflux disease (GERD). (3) To examine all pre-packaged medicines provided by Providence Health System to determine if there are medications that need to be added, and if there are medications that need to be deleted. Design: This is a descriptive research study with an administrative emphasis. Procedure: A total of sixty-one patient satisfaction surveys were administered over a three-week period. In addition a separate volunteer satisfaction survey was conducted. Each survey had a set number of Likert style questions. Each question had space provided for written comments and space was provided to encourage written comment on the topic of clinical improvements. The volunteer surveys were mailed. Included in the mailing was an addressed <b>return</b> envelope with <b>postage</b> in hopes of facilitating their return. To develop the clinical guidelines current criteria and stepwise approaches were cited. In conjunction with these already existing criteria volunteer providers were asked to comment and contribute ideas in the creation of the EHC specific guidelines. By reviewing EHC data it was determined which of the drugs that are provided to the clinic by Providence are used most frequently. Recommendations concerning drugs that are not currently supplied but would be beneficial were made, and ones that are not being used were recommended for discontinuation. Results: The patient satisfaction surveys as well as the volunteer satisfaction surveys described high levels of satisfaction. Compared to the past two years of available. data this years results represent an increase in the level of both patient and volunteer satisfaction. This increase is also representative of a three-year trend in a positive direction. Many positive comments were offered for continued improvements by both patients and volunteers. The clinical guidelines were also a success. With the help of many of the volunteer providers a sound set of guidelines was devised that reflect both the mission of the clinic and its commitment to quality care. The clinical guidelines also reflect the clinics commitment to providing appropriate medications for the ailments that are commonly treated. The study of the pre-packaged medicines was an offshoot of as well as a synthesis with the clinical guidelines. In the end the recommendations for pre-packaged medicines closely reflected the nature of the guidelines. Again it was with the help of the volunteer providers that these recommendations were arrived at. Conclusions: The success of this study is a direct reflection of the spirit of the EHC. The EHC occupies a unique and valued place in Washington County. Although this study may be seen as the tip of the iceberg concerning what might or could be done, the enthusiasm with which all of its author 2 ̆ 7 s requests were met is a positive reflection of the care and the dedication that goes into each patient encounter at the EHC. With continued care and dedication the EHC will continue to improve and meet the needs of the under and uninsured citizens of Washington County and beyond...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{assessed}} the utility and cost-effectiveness {{of using a}} World Wide Web-based questionnaire in a large prospective cohort study, the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS). In 1995, 59, 000 African-American women were recruited into the BWHS through a paper questionnaire. Follow-up paper questionnaires have been mailed every 2 years since then. During the 2003, 2005, and 2007 questionnaire cycles, participants were given the option of completing a Web-based questionnaire. The cost of developing and processing a returned paper questionnaire was 4 times that of a returned Web questionnaire, primarily because of <b>return</b> <b>postage</b> costs and greater processing time for paper questionnaires. The proportion of respondents who completed a Web questionnaire doubled from 2003 to 2007, from 10. 1 % to 19. 9 %, but the characteristics of those completing the Web questionnaire remained the same. Web response was greatest at younger ages (20. 9 % of those aged < 30 years) and declined with age to 3. 6 % among women aged 60 years or more. Web questionnaires were filled out more completely than paper questionnaires, regardless of the sensitivity of a question.

We hope to cover reports on research projects, courses, conferences attended, the activities of Branch Committees, book and concert reviews and other features, including a letters column. Letters for publication should be as brief as possible, and reports or articles should not exceed 1000 words. This will enable us to give a greater coverage and be more truly represent-ative of our membership. <b>Return</b> <b>postage</b> will be appreciated- {{which brings us to the}} important issue of the establishment of IASPM. We urge every reader to seek new members, both individuals and institutions, as vigorously as possible. We cannot emphasise too strongly how i mportant this is for the survival and growth of our new Association. Like all the work of the Temporary Executive Committee this first issue of RPM has been put together voluntarily. Help with thi s, and all other activities of IASPM is urgently required, so if you can assist, or have any ideas that may help, write to the Secretary, Philip Tagg...|$|E
40|$|Class of 2006 AbstractObjectives: To {{describe}} the current {{response rate of}} pharmacists to mailed surveys and to identify {{the factors that influence}} pharmacist response rates. A number of hypotheses have been presented. Design: A systematic literature review. Methods: Included articles were evaluated for variables of interest using a data extraction form. Variables included length of survey, use of incentive, proximity, use of announcement, the anonymity of the survey, use of a reminder, and presence of <b>return</b> <b>postage.</b> Results: A total of 76 articles were identified of which 54 met inclusion criteria. The mean response rate for the survey was 45. 8 percent. The effect on response rate was evaluated in regard to survey length, the inclusion of an incentive, and the geographical origination of the survey. The change in response rate for each single {{increase in the number of}} questions in a survey changed the response rate by 0. 001 percent. Response rate for surveys without an incentive provided was 44. 6 percent (SD = 0. 168), while the response rate for those with an incentive was 50. 7 percent (p > 0. 277). Twenty seven surveys were deemed to seek responses from pharmacists in a close proximity to the organization sending out the survey (e. g., within the same state or region). Twenty-seven did not focus on a specific state or region. The mean response rates were 45. 5 percent and 46. 1 percent, respectively (p= 0. 882). There was no statistical significance in any of the other variables examined. Conclusions: This review of literature addressing pharmacist response rate to mailed surveys revealed that pharmacists’ response to surveys is not significantly affected by survey length, inclusion of an incentive, or survey origin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study early bereavement across the four modes of death (natural, accident, suicide, and homicide) in White, Black, and Hispanic Americans. The respondents were surveyed regarding two time periods: (a) during the month before the death, as reported retrospectively, and (b) during the time since the death, as reported {{at the time of the}} study. Respondents were recruited from coroner 2 ̆ 7 s records. ^ They study consisted of two phases. In the first phase, bereaved respondents were administered a grief symptom questionnaire. The mean number of days from the death to the interview was 49. 6. In the second phase, the same repondents were asked to complete questionnaires concerning: (a) social supports, (b) psychological symptoms, (c) health behaviors, (d) grief experience, and (e) background information. The respondents were provided envelopes with <b>return</b> <b>postage</b> to mail completed questionnaires. The mean number of days from the death to receipt of the questionnaires was 58. Two hundred and one respondents (175 females; 26 males) participated in Phase One. One hundred and forty seven respondents (129 females; 18 males) participated in Phase Two. Due to sex differences found, only the female sample was analyzed for mode of death and ethnic group comparisons. ^ The results from mode of death comparisons suggest that homicide survivors, followed closely by accident survivors, may experience more intense bereavement than suicide or natural death survivors. This finding is particularly relevant because the former two groups have largely been ignored in the bereavement literature. The results from ethnic group comparisons suggest that there is no difference in intensity of bereavement. However, there appears to be a qualitative difference in the type of bereavement experienced between Hispanics, on one hand, and Whites and Blacks, on the other. The study provides a discussion of problems in conceptualization and measurement of grief and mourning and clinical implications of the findings. ...|$|E
