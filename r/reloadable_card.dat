5|$|On July 16, 2008, Miami-Dade Transit {{announced}} that it would be replacing all fare collection methods with the Easy Card system by late 2009. The system replaces the old cash and token-based system with one that automatically deducts fares at Metrorail fare gates from a <b>reloadable</b> <b>card.</b> The final station to start fare gate installation was Government Center on August 2, 2009. Since the system launch on October 1, 2009, all passengers using Metrorail must use either an Easy Card or Easy Ticket to enter stations. For almost the full first year of use, the Easy Card ticket vending machines allowed anyone to purchase thousands of dollars worth of Easy Cards by credit card without entering a PIN or billing zip code, which led to credit card thieves putting high dollar values on Easy Cards and selling them at a discounted rate for cash. Miami-Dade Transit initially mitigated this issue by limiting credit card transactions to three per day and a value limit of $112, and later by requiring zip code verification for all cards.|$|E

5000|$|A payment card number, primary {{account number}} (PAN), {{or simply a}} card number, is the card {{identifier}} found on payment cards, such as credit cards and debit cards, as well as stored-value cards, gift cards and other similar cards. In some situations the card number {{is referred to as}} a bank card number. The card number is primarily a card identifier and does not directly identify the bank account number to which the card is linked by the issuing company. The card number prefix identifies the issuer of the card, and the digits that follow identify a unique account which is associated by the issuing organization with one of its customers and then to the customer's designated bank accounts. In the case of stored-value type cards, the association with a particular customer is only made if the prepaid card is <b>reloadable.</b> <b>Card</b> numbers are allocated in accordance with ISO/IEC 7812. The card number is usually prominently embossed on the front of a payment card.|$|E
