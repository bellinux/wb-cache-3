In this task, the participants cannot control the speed of reading, while the experimenter determines the presentation speed. The {{participants are}} required to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> aloud and their reaction time of each segment is registered.

25|$|Sequoyah first {{taught the}} syllabary to his six-year old daughter, Ayokeh (also spelled Ayoka), {{because he could}} not find adults willing to learn it. He {{traveled}} to the Indian Reserves in the Arkansaw Territory where some Cherokee had settled. When he tried to convince the local leaders of the syllabary's usefulness, they doubted him. Sequoyah asked each leader to say a word, which he wrote down, and then called his daughter in to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> back. This demonstration convinced the leaders to let him teach the syllabary to a few more people. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, and read a dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokee that he had created a practical writing system.|$|E

Unfortunately, the dry ice on stage made it impossible to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> resulting the audience witnessing glimpses of him peering over the microphone to sing a few lines, then disappearing below the dry ice to read the next set.

The New York Times pointed out that, in order to collect the prize’s 8 million Swedish krona ($900,000), the Swedish Academy’s rules {{stipulate}} the laureate [...] "must deliver a lecture within {{six months of the}} official ceremony, which would have made Mr. Dylan’s deadline June 10." [...] Academy secretary Danius commented: [...] "The speech is extraordinary and, as one might expect, eloquent. Now that the lecture has been delivered, the Dylan adventure is coming to a close." [...] In his essay, Dylan writes about the impact that three important books made on him: Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front and Homer's The Odyssey. He concludes: [...] "Our songs are alive {{in the land of the}} living. But songs are unlike literature. They’re meant to be sung, not <b>read.</b> <b>The</b> <b>words</b> in Shakespeare’s plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, 'Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story'." [...] Alan Pasqua provided the uncredited piano accompaniment for the recorded speech.|$|E
500|$|The ghost fungus was {{initially}} described in 1844 by English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley as Agaricus nidiformis. Berkeley {{felt it was}} related to Agaricus ostreatus (now Pleurotus ostreatus) but remarked it was a [...] "far more magnificent species". Material was originally collected by Scottish naturalist James Drummond in 1841 on Banksia wood along the Swan River. He wrote [...] "when this fungus was laid on a newspaper, it emitted by night a phosphorescent light, enabling us to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> around it; and it continued {{to do so for}} several nights with gradually decreasing intensity as the plant dried up." [...] More material collected from near the base of a [...] "sickly but living" [...] shrub (Grevillea drummondii) was named as Agaricus lampas by Berkeley. He noted both were phosphorescent and closely related species. Tasmanian botanist Ronald Campbell Gunn collected material in October 1845 from that state, which Berkeley felt differed from previous collections in having more demarcated and less decurrent gills and a shorter stipe, and named it Agaricus phosphorus in 1848. Italian mycologist Pier Andrea Saccardo placed all three named taxa in the genus Pleurotus in 1887. These names have been synonymised with O.nidiformis, although the name Pleurotus lampas persisted in some texts, including the 1934–35 monograph of Australian fungi by John Burton Cleland. In reviewing the published literature, Victorian botanical liaison officer Jim Willis was aware of Rolf Singer's placing of Pleurotus olearius into the genus Omphalotus, but stopped short of transferring the ghost fungus across, even though he conceded it was wrongly placed in Pleurotus. Investigating the species in 1994, Orson K. Miller, Jr. gave the ghost fungus its current binomial name when he transferred it to the genus Omphalotus with other bioluminescent mushrooms.|$|E

The Mishnah <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "with all your soul" [...] in [...] to mean that one should love God even if it means God takes one's life.
