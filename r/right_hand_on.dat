5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} {{right hand to}} the head that caused Mayweather to retreat to the ropes and cover up. The {{momentum}} changed in the fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face. Then Mayweather landed a <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the bridge of Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner, and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower {{than it had been}} earlier in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Petry's wounds {{resulted}} {{in his right}} arm having to be amputated below the elbow. He was evacuated to an American hospital in Germany, where he spent several weeks in recovery before being transferred to Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center in Fort Hood, Texas. He now uses an advanced prosthetic in place of his <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>On</b> the prosthetic is a small plaque listing {{the names of the}} fallen Rangers of his regiment. After recovering, Petry did not seek a medical discharge; instead, he deployed to Afghanistan between recovering and receiving the Medal of Honor. He was later promoted to the rank of sergeant first class.|$|E
5|$|In 2013–14, Lin was {{replaced}} in the Rockets' starting lineup by Patrick Beverley, and Lin became the second unit's primary ball handler and scoring option as the team's sixth man. Houston liked beginning games with Beverley's defensive pressure, but also preferred increasing Lin's playing time without Harden {{also on the}} court. Lin and Harden were both attacking players offensively, but each struggled defensively. In November, Lin established the highest two-game scoring total of his career, 65 points, including season-highs of 34 points and 11 assists along with a Rockets record-tying nine three-pointers in a start in place of an injured Harden. It {{was followed by a}} 21-point performance in a win at New York. He received a round of applause upon entering the game, though it was more subdued than in his first return against the Knicks. On November 27, Lin sprained his right knee against the Atlanta Hawks, causing him to miss six games. He missed four additional games in December due to back spasms; he started in his return on December 23 with both Harden and Beverley injured—Beverley was estimated to be out four to six weeks due to a fractured <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>On</b> February 1, 2014, Lin recorded 15 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists—his first career triple-double—in 29 minutes off the bench in a 106–92 home victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was the first Rocket to notch a triple-double off the bench since Cedric Maxwell in 1988. However, he went into a shooting slump after the All-Star break, and again experienced problems with his back.|$|E

Public urination still remains more accepted by males in the UK, although British cultural tradition itself seems to find such practices objectionable.|$|E

25|$|At the 2017 World Team Trophy Hanyu came {{in seventh}} {{place in the}} men's short program. He popped his quadruple loop to a single loop and did not receive any points for this jump.

In his free skating Hanyu placed first after receiving 200.49 points for a routine that featured four quadruple jumps (with three {{in the second half of}} the program for the first time in history), including a quadruple toe loop-half loop-triple Salchow combination.

25|$|Confession {{does not}} {{take place in a}} confessional, but {{normally}} in {{the main part of the}} church itself, usually before an analogion (lectern) set up near the iconostasion. On the analogion is placed a Gospel Book and a blessing cross. The confession often takes place before an icon of Jesus Christ. Orthodox understand that the confession is not made to the priest, but to Christ, and the priest stands only as witness and guide. Before confessing, the penitent venerates the Gospel Book and cross, and places the thumb and first two fingers of his <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the feet of Christ as he is depicted on the cross. The confessor will often read an admonition warning the penitent to make a full confession, holding nothing back.|$|E
25|$|Smyth {{bounced back}} from an injury-filled first {{year with the}} Avalanche by {{remaining}} healthy {{for the majority of}} the 2008–09 season. During the campaign, Smyth and winger Milan Hejduk scored their respective 300th career goals on January 18, 2009, against the Calgary Flames in a 6–2 victory at the Pepsi Center. He went on to record 26 goals and 33 assists for 59 points over 77 games, before fracturing his <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> April 1, 2009, in a 3–0 home loss against the Phoenix Coyotes, ending his season five games early. He tied for the team lead in point-scoring with Hejduk, who played in five more games than Smyth. Dealing with long-term injuries to both Paul Stastny and captain Joe Sakic, the Avalanche struggled as a team and finished last in the Western Conference.|$|E
25|$|Much {{international}} attention was attracted especially {{by the discovery}} of an extremely rare find, a life-sized sandstone statue or stele, dating from the 5th century BC, which was found just outside the larger tumulus. The stele, fully preserved except for its feet, depicts an armed male warrior. It measures 186cm in height and weighs 230kg. It is made from a type of sandstone available within a few kilometres of Glauberg. Much detail is clearly visible: his trousers, composite armour tunic, wooden shield and a typical La Tène sword hanging from his right side. The moustachioed man wears a torc with three pendants, remarkably {{similar to the one}} from the chamber in mound 1, several rings on both arms and one on the <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>On</b> his head, he wears a hood-like headdress crowned by two protrusions, resembling the shape of a mistletoe leaf. Such headdresses are also known from a handful of contemporary sculptures. As mistletoe is believed to have held a magical or religious significance to the Celts, it could indicate that the warrior depicted also played the role of a priest. Fragments of three similar statues were also discovered in the area. It is suggested that all four statues once stood in the rectangular enclosure. Perhaps they were associated with an ancestor cult.|$|E

The woman with the stethoscope has her <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> resting <b>on</b> the table, near a pen...|$|R
25|$|The statue {{measures}} 74 centimetres (29inches) in height; {{the pedestal}} is 27 centimetres (10.6inches) in width. The {{core of the}} sculpture was carved from {{a single piece of}} wood, most likely from a poplar tree, though earlier art historians have assumed it to be pear, plum or lime. The sculpture’s surface is entirely covered with sheets of gold leaf less than 0.25 millimetres (0.01in) thick, which are held in place by minute golden bolts. The size of the individual gold leaves varies to suit the surface texture. The faces of both mother and child are pounded out of one single leaf each. The coloured eyes of the figures are made of cloisonné enamel. While the eyes of the mother are inset into carved fittings, those of the child are merely pasted on the wooden core. The child’s hand is made of cast silver and was added only in the 14th century; the original right hand is lost. There are traces of original tenth century adornments on the orb in the Virgin's <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>on</b> the right back leg of the stool, {{as well as on the}} child's book and halo. The agrafe showing an eagle and seemingly pinning Mary’s cloak is an early thirteenth century addition; the fibula beneath has Gothic features and is dated to the fourteenth century.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor, her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her heart as she looks up, adoringly, at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests {{on the edge of a}} table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood crucifix. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen. Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's stole. Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of Christ's crucifixion is hung on the wall behind the woman. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer. A chair with a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone.|$|E
500|$|Following {{performances}} by Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, and Mary Wells, The Jacksons {{took to the}} stage for their first group performance together in eight years. The brothers sang a medley of their old hits. After they finished with [...] "I'll Be There", they left Michael alone on stage. He addressed the audience and then went into his routine. He wore black pants, leather penny loafers, a black sequined jacket, and a single white rhinestone glove. To begin his performance, Jackson snapped a fedora to his head and struck a pose—his <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his hat and his left leg bent. During a musical interlude, the singer executed a move that many believe to have sealed {{his status as a}} pop icon. Jackson glided backwards to perform the moonwalk, before he spun on his heels and landed en pointe. It was the first time Jackson had performed the moonwalk in public; he had practiced it in his kitchen prior to the show.|$|E

500|$|The gada {{appears as}} an {{attribute}} in the oldest known sculpture of Vishnu (from Malhar, Madhya Pradesh), dated to c. 200 BCE. One {{of the earliest}} images of Vishnu date to the Kushan period (30–375 CE) found around Mathura, the gada {{does not appear in}} a stylised design as in later depictions, but the mace is a simple [...] "round top-heavy rod" [...] held in his upper (back) right hand and lifted above the shoulders. In another Kushan sculpture, the gada is depicted as a long rod which is almost the height of Vishnu and is held in his upper right hand. It is depicted similar to a long pestle (musala). A similar image found in Jhusi as well as early images from Western India depict Vishnu resting his upper <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the mace or holding the mace in this hand. Gupta images continue the trend of having upper (back) right hand resting on or holding the gada. The gada started being depicted in other arms. Twenty-four configurations of Vishnu images are noted, where the order of the four attributes is changed.|$|E
500|$|For recording, the Doors hired Elvis Presley's bassist Jerry Scheff {{and rhythm}} guitarist Marc Benno {{to round out}} their sound, with Scheff, in particular, {{contributing}} on every track except [...] "L'America". Densmore characterized Scheff as [...] "an in-the-pocket man" [...] and praised how he [...] "allowed me to communicate rhythmically with Morrison, and he slowed Ray down, when his <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the keyboards got too darn fast". By all accounts, Morrison– a huge Presley fan– was excited by Scheff's participation. In addition, Benno was asked to participate {{as a result of}} his recent notoriety from working with Leon Russell. The songs were completed in a few takes on a professional-quality 8-channel recorder, and the album was finished in six days. Morrison was a blues enthusiast and proclaimed the final recording session as [...] "blues day", recording [...] "Crawling King Snake", [...] "Cars Hiss By My Window", and [...] "L.A. Woman". The album had a raw, live sound with overdubs mostly limited to additional keyboards. Botnick explained, [...] "The overall concept for the recording session was to go back to our early roots and try to get everything live in the studio with as few overdubs as possible". Mixing was completed at Poppy Studios between February and March 1971, by which time Morrison had moved to Paris, France.|$|E
