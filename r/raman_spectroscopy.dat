5|$|<b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> {{has good}} spatial {{resolution}} (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiocarbon}} dating {{analysis of the}} papyrus by the Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory in 2013 dated the papyrus to between 404 and 209 BC. However, the cleaning protocol had to be interrupted during processing to preserve the fragment. A second analysis was performed by Harvard University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found a mean date of AD 741. A <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> analysis at Columbia University found that the ink was consistent with those in manuscripts from 400 BC to AD 700–800. These analyses suggest that the fragment as a material artifact is probably medieval and not modern.|$|E

5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E
5|$|Traces of red pigment {{still remain}} on the figure's body that was {{originally}} painted red overall. The feathers of her wings and the owls' feathers were also colored red, alternating with black and white. By <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> the red pigment is identified as red ochre, the black pigment, amorphous carbon ("lamp black") and the white pigment gypsum. Black pigment is also found on {{the background of the}} plaque, the hair and eyebrows, and on the lions' manes. The pubic triangle and the areola appear accentuated with red pigment but were not separately painted black. The lions' bodies were painted white. The British Museum curators assume that the horns of the headdress and part of the necklace were originally colored yellow, just as they are on a very similar clay figure from Ur. They surmise that the bracelets and rod-and-ring symbols might also have been painted yellow. However, no traces of yellow pigment now {{remain on the}} relief.|$|E

The thermal analysis showed three degradation stages related to fatty acids, starch and PBAT.

25|$|The {{differences}} {{are much more}} pronounced in vibrational spectroscopy such as infrared spectroscopy and <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> and in rotational spectra such as microwave spectroscopy because the reduced mass of the deuterium is markedly {{higher than that of}} protium. In nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, deuterium has a very different NMR frequency (e.g. 61 MHz when protium is at 400 MHz) and is much less sensitive. Deuterated solvents are usually used in protium NMR to prevent the solvent from overlapping with the signal, although deuterium NMR on its own right is also possible.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a novel two-step {{strategy}} for the coating of cardiovascular stents by strongly adhering biocompatible and biodegradable aliphatic polyesters. First, a precoating of poly(ethylacrylate) (PEA) was electrografted onto the metallic substrate by cathodic reduction of the parent monomer in dimethylformamide (DMF). The electrodeposition of PEA, in a good solvent of it, was confirmed by both Infra-red and <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopies.</b> The pendant ester groups of PEA were then chemically reduced into aluminum alkoxides, able to initiate the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of either D,L-lactide (LA) or epsilon-caprolactone (CL). Growth of biodegradable PLA or PCL coatings from the adhering precoating was confirmed by both Infra-red and <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopies,</b> and directly observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This type of coating can act as an anchoring layer for the subsequent casting of drug-loaded polyester films allowing the controlled release of antiproliferative agents {{for the treatment of}} in-stent restenosis.

Previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through DPSS which are comparatively expensive and inefficient, however these technologies are still widely used by the scientific community for applications including optogenetics, <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> and particle image velocimetry, due to their superior beam quality.

25|$|The {{combination}} of atoms into molecules {{leads to the}} creation of unique types of energetic states and therefore unique spectra of the transitions between these states. Molecular spectra can be obtained due to electron spin states (electron paramagnetic resonance), molecular rotations, molecular vibration and electronic states. Rotations are collective motions of the atomic nuclei and typically lead to spectra in the microwave and millimeter-wave spectral regions; rotational spectroscopy and microwave spectroscopy are synonymous. Vibrations are relative motions of the atomic nuclei and are studied by both infrared and <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> Electronic excitations are studied using visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy as well as fluorescence spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, McCrone visited Yale to take new microsamples {{from the}} map, partly {{to check his}} earlier results, and partly to apply new techniques.
