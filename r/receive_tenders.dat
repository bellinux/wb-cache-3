50|$|In the 1930s and 1940s the {{business}} grew as Albert's son, Geoffrey Krolle, joins {{the business}}. Tanner and Co. continued to <b>receive</b> <b>tenders</b> from the Ministry of Supply for straps, gun instrument covers, cockpit covers, canvas and leather equipment for military use. Unfortunately, in 1940, the entire building in Dorset Rise was destroyed through bombing and fire and all records, archive material, historical pieces were lost. New premises were temporarily found in Wheatsheaf House in Carmelite Street {{in the old}} Daily Mail building. By {{the end of the}} 1940s, R.T. Tanner and Co. Ltd. moved to Crayford and the company began exporting to the U.S.A. to stores such as Brooks, Saks, Gimbel, Crouch Fitzgerald and London Harness. Harrods remained the biggest customer along with Fortnum and Mason as the product line was expanded to include zip suitcases, pullman bags, attaché cases and document cases.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the master thesis was a fine arts colony for primary school pupils as {{motivation}} for fine arts activity. In general, {{there have been few}} studies and papers on fine arts colonies for primary school pupils. A fine arts colony is organised outside the standard space, classroom, and provides a possibility of a wider and deeper exploration of all fine arts fields and techniques. Each year, educators <b>receive</b> <b>tenders</b> for fine arts colonies, but can apply {{only a limited number of}} pupils. Therefore, our current practice is to only apply pupils gifted in fine arts. We can consequently conclude that there are likely many pupils also gifted in fine arts that do not attend the fine arts colony. The objective of the study was to determine the interest for attending the fine arts colony, whether the colony motivates pupils for additional fine arts activity, or is it just another competition, or fine arts contest, which stimulates pupils for fine arts with its external motivational assets (high prizes for selected works for an exhibition, recognition for award-winning works, etc.). The objective of the study was to prove that a fine arts colony is a means of motivation for fine arts activities for all pupils. In the theoretical section, we have emphasised motivation in the learning process, motivation for fine arts creativity, goals and purpose of organising the fine arts colony, comparison of fine arts colonies with contests and ex tempore and fine arts colonies as additional work with gifted pupils. The empirical section of the study is composed of two parts: quantitative non-experimental questionnaire for pupils that attended the colony and for those that did not attend the colony. The qualitative research includes case study of pupils that were identified and included in a personalised programme for gifted pupils and those that were not. By analysing fine arts works, we have presented the difference in motivation for work in a classroom and fine arts activity in a fine arts colony. The results of the qualitative and quantitative study will contribute to a new didactic quality of fine arts courses in the fine arts colony framework. They will contribute an insight into methods of teaching and work with gifted pupils in the field of fine arts. We have designed a model for planning and implementing a fine arts colony, where pupils will acquire quality fine arts experience and will be additionally motivated for fine arts activity. ...|$|E
