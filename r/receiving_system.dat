The {{lack of an}} ATC system on most of Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed Automatic Warning System (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator in the cab. The <b>receiving</b> <b>system</b> was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately {{in front of the}} cab on the right-hand side and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Requirements to {{the task}} of {{necessary}} accuracy of calibration of through tracts characteristics for hydroacoustic <b>receiving</b> <b>systems</b> are discussed, when the combined <b>receiving</b> <b>systems</b> (CRS) consisting of vector receivers, including complex antennas, are used in water environment. The use of CRS assumes joint processing of signals from the channel of acoustic pressure receiver and three channels of the vector receiver. Thus various characteristics of acoustic field in the same point of space are registered. It imposes rather rigid conditions on determination errors of amplitude-frequency and difference-phase characteristics between channels at their calibration, and also on the frequency and phase characteristics of sound receivers at their graduation. The existing regulated errors for hydrophones and single-channel accelerometers are not always satisfactory for the vector receivers intended for operating in CRS. This paper deals with requirements to errors of amplitude-frequency and difference-phase characteristics for providing for optimum operating of <b>receiving</b> <b>systems</b> consisting of vector receivers for additive or multiplicative processing of signals. It was shown that required precision characteristics for calibration of vector receivers were determined appreciably by algorithms of data processing. Fo...|$|R
