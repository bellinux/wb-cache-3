5|$|The mass balance, or {{difference}} between accumulation and ablation (melting and sublimation), of a glacier {{is crucial to}} its survival. Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, resulting in changes in mass balance. A glacier with a sustained negative balance loses equilibrium and retreats. A sustained positive balance is also out of equilibrium and will advance to <b>reestablish</b> equilibrium. Currently, nearly all glaciers have a negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in 1375, the See of Sis {{experienced}} decline and disarray. The Catholicosate of Aghtamar and the locally influential Syunik bishops enhanced the importance of the region around Etchmiadzin. In 1441 a general council of several hundred religious figures met in Etchmiadzin and voted to <b>reestablish</b> a catholicosate there. The cathedral was restored by Catholicos Kirakos (Cyriacus) between 1441 and 1443.

5|$|In 2013, the US Government Accountability Office said a {{shortage}} of lithium-7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk”. The problem stems from the decline of US nuclear infrastructure. The equipment needed to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7 is mostly a cold war leftover. The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963, when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. The report {{said it would take}} five years and $10 million to $12 million to <b>reestablish</b> the ability to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7.|$|E

The deer population has grown so much that today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas. River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in the gorge. Despite the fears of anglers, their diet is only 5percent trout.|$|E
