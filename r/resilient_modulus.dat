For this purpose, complex modulus of four different asphalt mixtures were utilized and after validating results of numerical method for determining Mr, based on linear viscoelastic theory, resilient moduli of these mixtures were computed under different conditions.

The determination of the <b>resilient</b> <b>modulus</b> requires sophisticated equipment and skilled personnel for laboratory and field testing. These requirements have contributed immensely to the proliferation of different <b>resilient</b> <b>modulus</b> test procedures. Commonly used <b>resilient</b> <b>modulus</b> laboratory test methods for pavement geomaterials such as subgrade soils and unbound granular materials have evolved from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) test protocols. This paper presents an overview on the state-of-the-art test procedures for determining <b>resilient</b> <b>modulus</b> of pavement geomaterials. Differences between current test procedures, and some potential challenges with {{the adoption of a}} universal test procedure are discussed. Common <b>resilient</b> <b>modulus</b> models used for characterising pavement geomaterials in flexible pavement design are also presented.

40|$|Abstract. Subgrade <b>resilient</b> <b>modulus</b> (MR) is very {{important}} for effective design of pavements. Several methods to estimate the <b>resilient</b> <b>modulus</b> were suggested in the past years. The main objective of this paper was to validate the correlation of MR with other physical properties of the subgrade soils. Cohesive soils representing major soil types in Shanghai were selected. The <b>resilient</b> <b>modulus</b> tests were conducted with UTM. Additional analysis was then performed to develop correlations between the model parameters and other soil properties. To verify the prediction models independently, laboratory MR tests were conducted on new subgrade soils. It was observed that the predicted MR values compared well with the laboratory measured values for the soil samples...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} of the <b>resilient</b> <b>modulus</b> test to characterize the mechanical response of unbound aggregates. The paper is divided into two sections. The first section presents the results of a laboratory study aimed at identifying the significant factors that affect the <b>resilient</b> <b>modulus</b> of granular materials. Using the principles of experimental factorial design, four parameters, namely: deviator stress, confining pressure, moisture content and material dry density were included in the investigation. <b>Resilient</b> <b>modulus</b> test results showed that the effect of the deviator stress was the most significant followed by the effect of moisture content. Other factors appear to have little or no effect at all on the modulus parameter...|$|E
