40|$|The Gujarat pogrom of 2002 is {{evidence}} of a profound crisis in India's democracy. Samuel P. Huntington's influential thesis of the 'clash of civilizations,' according to which the world is torn between democratic western values and threatening Islamic values, gives no help in explaining the situation, since the threatening values <b>of</b> the Hindu <b>Right</b> derive largely from European origins and {{are being used to}} threaten innocent Muslim civilians. I argue that the real 'clash of civilization' is the clash within every modern society between those who are prepared to live with people who differ, on terms of equal respect, and those who seek the comfort of a single 'pure' ethno-religious ideology. At a deeper level, the 'clash' is internal to each human being, as fear and aggression contend against compassion and respect. Policy-makers eager to promote the victory of respect over violence can learn from the case of India, where a wise institutional structure and a genuinely free press are major assets in resisting the call to hate. On the other hand, India's current lack of emphasis on critical thinking in the schools, and its lack after Gandhi's death of a public culture of compassion to counter the Hindu <b>Right's</b> culture <b>of</b> humiliated, <b>warlike</b> masculinity, sound warning notes for the future.

40|$|Warlike {{women are}} a {{recurring}} phenomenon in German literature and culture since 1500. Amazons, terrorists, warrior women [...] this volume of essays by leading scholars from the UK and Germany analyzes ideas and portrayals of these {{figures in the}} visual arts, society, media, and scholarship, always {{against the backdrop of}} Germany's development as a culture and as a nation. The contributors look for patterns in the historical portrayal <b>of</b> <b>warlike</b> women, asking the questions: What cultural signals are sent when women are shown occupying men's spaces by dressing as warriors or in men's clothing? What can legitimize the woman who bears arms? From what is the erotic potential of images linking women and violence derived? Have recent feminist thought and political developments changed representations <b>of</b> <b>warlike</b> women...|$|R

50|$|According to Marija Gimbutas, the Vinča {{culture was}} part of Old Europe - a {{relatively}} homogeneous, peaceful and matrifocal culture that occupied Europe during the Neolithic.

60|$|Thus, at the {{appointed}} time over 100,000 men assembled at Berwick, of whom 40,000 were men-at-arms, {{and the rest}} archers and pikemen.

50|$|But {{then there}} was a {{cultural}} transformation during a chaotic time of disequilibrium related to climate change and incursions <b>of</b> <b>warlike,</b> nomadic tribes. These peoples brought with them a domination system and imposed rigid rankings of domination, including the rigid domination by men of women and the equation of “real masculinity” with domination and violence. This led to a radical cultural transformation.|$|R
50|$|Metalwork {{stands out}} in Celtiberian archaeological finds, partly from its indestructible nature, {{emphasizing}} Celtiberian articles <b>of</b> <b>warlike</b> uses, horse trappings and prestige weapons. The two-edged sword adopted by the Romans was previously in use among the Celtiberians, and Latin lancea, a thrown spear, was a Hispanic word, according to Varro. Celtiberian culture was increasingly influenced by Rome in the two final centuries BC.|$|R
50|$|The {{fortress}} of Lichtenau {{goes back to}} a medieval water castle. In 1406 Nuremberg purchased the village and the castle of Lichtenau from Frederick II of Heideck. Because of the location of Lichtenau as a tactical outpost of the Imperial City of Nuremberg within {{the territory of the}} margraves of Brandenburg-Ansbach there was frequently tension and destruction as a result <b>of</b> <b>warlike</b> conflicts.|$|R
25|$|The {{evidence}} {{contained in}} the myth hints that initially, before the passage from Scandinavia to the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, the Lombards worshiped the Vanir.

60|$|Nevertheless, these {{proceedings}} but {{amounted to}} a postponement of hostilities; for soon after, nothing prevented the two kings from plunging into war, but the following judicious considerations. First: Media was almost afraid of being beaten. Second: Bello was almost afraid to conquer. Media, because he was inferior in men and arms; Bello, because, his aggrandizement was already a subject <b>of</b> <b>warlike</b> comment among the neighboring kings.|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{the wild}} dreamer was awake at last.
