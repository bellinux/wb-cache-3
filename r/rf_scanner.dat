40|$|RFIDs (Radio Frequency Identification tags) {{are small}} {{integrated}} circuits connected to an antenna, which {{can respond to}} an interrogating RF signal with simple identifying information, or with more complex signals. The main objective of these tags is to store data and make it readily available as well as ensuring that it is safely stored in or on the object or person that is concerned by the data as well as making counterfeiting of objects more difficult, if not impossible. RFIDs have been introduced in the filament of Euro banknotes {{in an attempt to}} keep track of money movements both when ransoms are requested in non-consecutive notes and in transactions where up to today cash was used to guarantee anonymity. RF scanners will most probably be installed in airports, train stations in order to catch people attempting to move large sums of money out or around countries. This measure should, in theory, reduce tax evasion as well as terrorist activities, including arms and drugs dealing. In principle, when sensitive data is stored, there should be certain level of security involved in its protection. Data on RFIDs cannot, at present, be encrypted. Physically, a RFID cannot easily be stolen if it is implanted in a personâ€™s arm but, a hacker with a suitable <b>RF</b> <b>scanner,</b> could access the data with greater ease and without the victim even noticing. This paper aims at analysing the implications of introducing RFIDs in the filament of the Euro notes as well as discerning {{the pros and cons of}} using this technology in various scenarios and studying the psychological impacts and repercussions of crimes related to the theft and use of the data acquired by the perpetrators. The introduction of RFIDs in paper money will most probably bring about a certain level of discomfort as it will inevitably be perceived as a key factor of control upon our lives...|$|E

The algorithm for encryption is based on DES algorithm with a novel skew core key scheduling.

40|$|Off-resonant spinlock (SL) enables an NMR imaging {{technique}} that can detect dilute metabolites similar to chemical exchange saturation transfer. However, in clinical MR <b>scanners,</b> <b>RF</b> pulse widths are restricted due to recommended {{specific absorption rate}} limits. Therefore, trains of short RF pulses that provide effective saturation during the required irradiation period are commonly employed. Quantitative evaluation of spectra obtained by pulsed saturation schemes is harder to achieve, since the theory of continuous wave saturation cannot be applied directly. In this paper we demonstrate the general feasibility of quantifying proton exchange rates from data obtained in pulsed SL experiments on a clinical 3 [*]T MR scanner. We also propose a theoretical treatment of pulsed SL {{in the presence of}} chemical exchange using an interleaved saturation-relaxation approach. We show that modeling magnetization transfer during the pauses between the RF pulses is crucial, {{especially in the case of}} exchange rates that are small with respect to the delay times. The dynamics is still governed by a monoexponential decay towards steady state, for which we give the effective rate constant. The derived analytical model agrees well with the full numerical simulation of the Bloch-McConnell equations for a broad range of values of the system parameters...|$|R
