50|$|An Onboard <b>refueling</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>recovery</b> system (ORVR) is {{a vehicle}} fuel vapor {{emission}} control system that captures volatile organic compounds (VOC, potentially harmful vapors) during refueling. There {{are two types of}} vehicle {{emission control system}}s: the ORVR, and the Stage II vapor recovery system. Without either of these two systems, fuel vapors trapped inside gas tanks would be released into the atmosphere, each time refueling of the vehicle occurred. However, an ORVR system is able to retain those emissions, delivering them to the vehicle's carbon-filled canister and then to dispose of those vapors by adding them to the engine intake manifold and the stream of fuel supplying the engine, during normal operation. The goal behind implementing the ORVR system throughout the U.S. is to eventually make the Stage II systems obsolete.|$|E
40|$|In China, fast {{increase}} in passenger cars and gasoline consumption with yet quite limited <b>vapor</b> <b>recovery</b> during gasoline distribution has procured growing concern about gasoline evaporation {{as an important}} emission source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particularly in megacities hard-hit by air quality problems. This study presents VOC species profiles related to major pathways of gasoline evaporative loss in China, including headspace displacement, refueling operations and spillage/leakage. Apart from liquid gasoline and headspace vapors, gasoline <b>vapors</b> emitted when <b>refueling</b> cars in service stations or tank trucks in oil marketing depots were also sampled in situ with <b>vapor</b> <b>recovery</b> units (VRUs) turning on/off. Alkanes, alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons accounted for 55 - 66, 21 - 35 and 4 - 8 % in <b>refueling</b> <b>vapors,</b> 59 - 72, 18 - 28 and 4 - 10 % in headspace vapors and 33 - 51, 8 - 15 and 38 - 48 % in liquid gasoline samples, respectively. During refueling with VRUs turning on, total VOCs in vapors were less than one fifth of that with VRUs turning off, and aromatic hydrocarbons had higher weight percentages of about 8 % in contrast with that of about 4 % during refueling with VRUs turning off. <b>Refueling</b> <b>vapors,</b> especially for that with VRUs turning off, showed a larger fraction of light hydrocarbons including C- 3 -O- 5 light alkenes when compared to headspace vapors, probably due to splashing and disturbance during filling operation. In <b>refueling</b> or headspace <b>vapors</b> the ratios of i-pentane/benzene, i-pentane/toluene, and MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) /benzene ranged 8. 7 - 57, 2. 7 - 4. 8, and 1. 9 - 6. 6, respectively; and they are distinctively much higher than those previously reported in vehicle exhausts. Calculated normalized reactivity or ozone formation potential of the gasoline vapors in China ranged 3. 3 - 4. 4 g O- 3 g(- 1) VOC, about twice that of gasoline headspace vapors reported in USA {{as a result of}} larger fractions of alkenes in China's gasoline vapors. The results suggested that reducing VOC emission from gasoline distribution sector would particularly benefit ground-level ozone control in China. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Occupational {{exposures}} to organic solvents, specifically acetonitrile and methanol, {{have the potential}} to cause serious long-term health effects. In the laboratory, these solvents are used extensively in protocols involving the use of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Operators of HPLC equipment may be potentially exposed to these organic solvents when local exhaust ventilation is not employed properly or is not available, which can be the case in many settings. The objective of this research was to characterize the various sites of vapor release in the HPLC process and then to determine the relative influence of a novel <b>vapor</b> <b>recovery</b> system on the overall exposure to laboratory personnel. The effectiveness of steps to reduce environmental solvent vapor concentrations was assessed by measuring exposure levels of acetonitrile and methanol before and after installation of the <b>vapor</b> <b>recovery</b> system. With respect to acetonitrile, the concentration was not statistically significant with p= 0. 938; moreover, exposure after the intervention was actually higher than prior to intervention. With respect to methanol, the concentration was not statistically significant with p= 0. 278. This indicates that the exposure to methanol after the intervention was not statistically significantly higher or lower than prior to intervention. Thus, installation of the <b>vapor</b> <b>recovery</b> device did not result in statistically significant reduction in exposures in the settings encountered, and acetonitrile actually increased significantly. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Vapor</b> <b>Recovery</b> Units (VRU’s) have {{commonly}} {{been used}} to capture vented gas and other waste gas (<b>vapor</b> <b>recovery)</b> during petroleum production, it was originally created to capture hydrogen sulfide from oilfield stock tanks. A VRU works by compressing the flash gas that is produced in storage tanks and other units {{to be put into}} a pipeline. A basic VRU is made up of a scrubber, compressor, and a switch. Once the pressure in the tank reaches the set-point, the switch kicks on the compressor and sends the vapor to a scrubber where the liquid portion is separated out. The gas portions can be used to fuel on-site operation, be transported to storage tanks for further separation, can be piped out directly to another facility, or be injected into a compressor; the liquid portions (NGLs) that commonly form are normally sent to the water tank. If they are sent to oil storage they will re-vaporize and go through the VRU, creating an endless cycle.|$|R

5|$|Loading an {{oil tanker}} {{consists}} primarily of pumping cargo into the ship's tanks. As oil enters the tank, the vapors inside the tank must be somehow expelled.

50|$|Problem- An ORVR carbon-filled {{canister}} (installed {{on modern}} vehicles) {{is designed to}} capture fuel <b>vapors</b> displaced while <b>refueling,</b> and then to inject them into the intake manifold later on, {{so that they are}} burned along with the regular fuel, during normal engine operation. However, a Stage II <b>vapor</b> <b>recovery</b> system, installed on refuling gas station pumps, uses a vacuum to prevent fuel vapors from being released into the atmosphere. The design of the fill pipe seal in ORVR systems, prevents fuel vapors from entering the fuel tank fill pipe. That frustrates the purpose of the Stage II nozzle, which was designed to vacuum away any fuel vapors that come up that fill pipe, during the refuelling process. If the car's own <b>vapor</b> <b>recovery</b> system is working properly, then the Stage II nozzle will only be vacuuming normal fresh air and depositing that into the gas station's underground fuel storage tanks. That ends up causing evaporation of fuel vapors into the atmosphere, because too much pressure builds up in those fuel storage tanks. When that pressure becomes too great, it is released into the atmosphere via a pressure relief pipe.|$|R
