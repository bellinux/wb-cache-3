50|$|Dr. Kagan's {{program of}} {{clinical}} research {{is centered on}} <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> and <b>illness,</b> {{with a focus on}} symptom experience for older adults, particularly those who have cancer. Her second book - published by Penn Press in 2009 - is entitled Cancer in the Lives of Older Americans: Blessings and Battles. Dr. Kagan commonly examines the experience of cancer for older adults through naturalistic, interactionist inquiry using head and neck cancer as a model to understand cancer experience in older adults. Her Current investigations include collaborative projects to understand embodiment in younger and older individuals who have oral tongue cancer and that of those who have undergone microvascular reconstruction of the oral cavity for oral tongue and mandible cancers. Dr. Kagan welcomes undergraduate students, in particular, as collaborators in her research.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades {{genomics}} has completely reshaped the way in which patients and physicians experience and make sense of illness. In this paper we build upon a real case – namely that of breast cancer genetic testing – in order to point to the shortcomings of the paradigm currently driving healthcare delivery. In particular, we put forward a viable analytical model {{for the construction of a}} proper decisional process broadening the scope of medical gaze onto <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> of <b>illness.</b> This model revolves around four main conceptual axes: (i) communicating information; (ii) informing decisions; (iii) respecting narratives; (iv) empowering decision-making. These four kernels, we argue, map precisely onto the main pitfalls of the model presently dealing with genetic testing provision. Medical Humanities, we conclude, ought to play a pivotal role in constructing the environment for competent decision-making, autonomous self-determination and respectful narritivization of one’s own life...|$|R

40|$|Jazz has {{influenced}} world music and culture globally – attesting to its universal truths of surviving, enduring, and triumphing over tragedy. This begs the question, {{what can we}} glean in medical education from this philosophy of jazz mentoring? Despite our training to understand disease and illness in branching logic diagrams, the <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> of <b>illness</b> is still best understood when told as a story. Stories like music have tempos, pauses, and silences. Often they are not linear but wrap around the past, future, {{and back to the}} present, frustrating the novice and the experienced clinician in documenting the history of present illness. The first mentoring lesson Hancock discusses is from a time he felt stuck with his playing – his sound was routine. Miles Davis told him in a low husky murmur, ‘Don’t play the butter notes’. In medical education, ‘don’t play the butter notes’ suggests not undervaluing the metacognition and reflective aspects of medical training that need to be fostered {{during the early years of}} clinical teaching years...|$|R
40|$|Foodborne {{diseases}} {{are an important}} cause of <b>human</b> <b>illness</b> worldwide. <b>Humans</b> acquire these infections {{from a variety of}} sources and routes of transmission. Many efforts have been made in the last decades to prevent and control foodborne diseases, particularly foodborne zoonoses. However, information on the impact of these interventions is limited. To identify and prioritize successful food safety interventions, it is important to attribute the burden of <b>human</b> <b>illness</b> to the specific sources. Defining scientific concepts and harmonizing terminology for "source attribution" is essential for understanding and improving attribution methodologies and for sharing knowledge within the scientific community. We propose harmonized nomenclature, and describe the various approaches for <b>human</b> <b>illness</b> source attribution and their usefulness to address specific public health questions...|$|R

Over 40 different foodborne microbial pathogens, including fungi, viruses, parasites, and bacteria, are believed to cause <b>human</b> <b>illnesses.</b> For six bacterial pathogens, the costs of <b>human</b> <b>illness</b> {{are estimated to be}} $ 9. 3 -$ 12. 9 billion annually.

These estimates were developed to provide analytical support for USDA's Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) systems rule for meat and poultry. (Note that the parasite Toxoplasma gondii is not included in this report.) To estimate medical costs and productivity losses, ERS uses four severity categories for acute illnesses: those who did not visit a physician, visited a physician, were hospitalized, or died prematurely.
