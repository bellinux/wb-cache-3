40|$|The {{relationship}} between housing characteristics and residential property price is complex to illustrate. To {{have a better}} understanding of the housing-price structure, structural or spatial submarkets have been introduced in previous studies. However, there is no consensus on the importance of neighborhood effect among them. With regard to this issue, this study specifically focuses on the differences in structural, geographical, and demographical effects between housing submarkets (as categorized by dwelling space). Market subdivisions are relative to consumer behaviors. The heterogeneity of spatial effects in different submarkets gives an explanation as to why the impact of nonneighborhood housing factors in those submarket models is similar, regardless of whether the neighborhood effect is included or not. It also indicates that only some, but not all, of the potential purchasers would make decisions with <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>transaction</b> records of flats in the surrounding areas, only when the flat they want to buy is within a specific range in size. Other critical characteristics such as building age, dwelling space, location choice, and commuting time (to central business district) show remarkably different effects on housing price in those submarkets. Segmentation of housing market by dwelling space (and the average price per square feet is higher when the flats are larger) helps to obtain a better understanding of the importance of dwelling space in housing valuations and in urban housing planning.

To date, the law and economics revolution has largely bypassed international law. The Article identifies the three reasons why international lawyers have not extensively used economic analysis and explains why none of these reasons is persuasive. Second, the Article provides a {{reason to believe that}} economic analysis will enrich our understanding of international law by detailing an analogy between the market of international relations and traditional markets for goods. Subsequent parts explore the applicability of economic analysis to three important international law topics: the allocation of prescriptive jurisdiction, the law of treaties, and the competences of international organizations. In each of these parts, the authors analogize the international legal issue to a domestic legal issue, and then explore whether the economic methodologies that have been used domestically can be used on the international plane. They further identify certain methodologies, such as the new institutional economics and public choice theory, as having much greater promise in international legal analysis than other economic approaches, including price theory (when employed without <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and strategic considerations). Next, the Article outlines some of the conceptual and practical difficulties associated with economic analysis of international law.

The notion of backward tracing, however, has not met with universal support in the English cases and remains controversial.

40|$|Finding all {{frequent}} itemsets in a dataset {{using the}} traditional Apriori approach is too computationally expensive for datasets that contain many large frequent itemsets. The two main reasons are huge candidate generation requirements, {{and the large}} number of database scans. This project attempts to address this limitation with two different approaches. The first approach, dubbed Hash FP (frequent patterns), grows frequent itemsets directly out of the transactions where frequent item subsets were found. This requires storing <b>references</b> <b>to</b> all <b>transactions</b> where a frequent itemset was found, and hashing frequent itemsets into a table, so that itemsets found in separate transactions are quickly identified and counted. This solution avoids Apriori style candidate generation and reduces database scanning by visiting only relevant transactions. It has some similarities to FP-Growth, but does not build a tree structure. The second approach is a simple implementation of the Pincer algorithm. It is based on the Apriori algorithm, using Apriori to generate and test candidate itemsets. It also, simultaneously, searches for maximum frequent itemsets. Each cycle use...|$|R
40|$|In the modern, multi-threaded, {{multi-core}} programming environment, correctly managing system {{resources such}} as locks and shared variables can be especially difficult and error-prone. A simple error, such as forgetting to release a lock, can have major consequences on the correct operation of the program (e. g. deadlock), often {{at a time and}} location that is isolated from the original error. While there have been many previous proposals for managing locks and resources, these often arise from the systems arena, and are therefore often only loosely integrated with the host programming language. Such approaches therefore do not generally provide the strong formal guarantees of correctness-by-construction that we would prefer for all fundamental properties of our programs. In this paper, we propose a new type-based approach to resource management, based on the use of dependent types to construct a Domain-Specific Embedded Language (DSEL) whose typing rules enforce the properties we require.

In this paper we identify several situations where {{a sequence of}} operations over time within a single transaction can violate ACID properties.

We describe how to correctly implement most queries that make explicit <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> this (unknown) <b>transaction</b> time, and argue that the rest, which can be syntactically identified, can only be answered with an approximation of the correct value. The drawback of timestamping after commit is that it requires revisiting tuples.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{designate}} those characteristics of a brokerage contract that distinguish it from other types of contracts. The author begins by analysing the notion of insurance mediation {{on the basis of}} its legal definition as well as the practice o f the market. In consequence, he uses the notion in its strict sense, i. e. in <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> concluding <b>transactions,</b> and not denoting any form of consulting, especially risk management. Since the main area of insurance broker’s activity consists in rendering services of insurance mediation, the author proposes to define brokerage contract as contract for these services. However, if an insurance broker renders any additional services, in particular in the area of risk management, then two separate and different legal relations occur. Furthermore, a brokerage contract is characteristic on the one hand for its parties, as the broker is always a party to the contract, and on the other for the fact that the broker is remunerated by the insurer rather than the client himself, although it is the client that orders the services (the contract is thus considered gratuitous). The remuneration, called brokerage fee, is paid for the service of insurance mediation, which aims at facilitating the conclusion of an insurance contract. This leads to the conclusion that two types of services rendered by the broker should be distinguished: consultation (not remunerated by the insurer) and mediation services, which make the broker’s remuneration model so distinctive...|$|R

40|$|In a {{centralized}} RAN, the signals from multiple RAPs are processed centrally in a data center. Centralized RAN enables advanced interference coordination strategies while leveraging the elastic provisioning of data processing resources. It is particularly {{well suited for}} dense deployments, such as within a large building where the RAPs are connected via fibre and many cells are underutilized. This paper considers the computational requirements of centralized RAN {{with the goal of}} illuminating the benefits of pooling computational resources. A new analytical framework is proposed for quantifying the computational load associated with the centralized processing of uplink signals in the presence of block Rayleigh fading, distance-dependent path-loss, and fractional power control. Several new performance metrics are defined, including computational outage probability, outage complexity, computational gain, computational diversity, and the complexity-rate tradeoff. The validity of the analytical framework is confirmed by comparing it numerically with a simulator compliant with the 3 GPP LTE standard. Using the developed metrics, it is shown that centralizing the computing resources provides a higher net throughput per computational resource as compared to local processing.

How these modes of risk management are institutionally organised around the world on a 24 hour basis not only affects the performance of such firms as investment managers but may also affect the volatility of global financial markets themselves. We pay particular attention to the apparently mundane issues of from where the management process is centred, the actual mechanics of handing trading books on from market to market within the firm, and the calculation and communication of risk profiles by firms in response to market conditions. The paper emphasizes the problem of the management of dispersed information within the firm and relies upon both published empirical research on the patterns of foreign exchange volatility and a detailed study of the management process of one global financial house.

A device that is part of a PCI validated P2Pe solution uses an algorithmic calculation to encrypt the confidential payment card data. From the POI, the encrypted, indecipherable codes are sent to the payment gateway or processor for decryption. The keys for encryption and decryption are never available to the merchant, making card data entirely invisible to the retailer. Once the encrypted codes are within the secure data zone of the payment processor, the codes are decrypted to the original card numbers and then passed to the issuing bank for authorization.

40|$|The {{growing trend}} of {{collaborative}} R&D {{has been well}} documented recently, both at a global level and through national and industry case studies. However, there is no general agreement on its causes {{as well as on the}} motives of the firms collaborating in R&D with other players. The Japanese innovation system (JIS) is no exception. Furthermore, in this case, it is particularly important, because the JIS has been described since the 1970 s as dominated by "in-house" R&D by large firms and this feature has been considered as one reason of the limits that the JIS reached at the end of the 1980 s. By contrast to the existing literature on collaborative R&D in Japan, this paper focus on the case of the robot technology (RT), by using patent data applied in Japan between 1991 and 2004. The questions we address in this paper are as follows: Did the R&D collaboration in RT increase since the beginning of the 1990 s? Did the R&D collaborations lead to higher quality of the outcomes? Is it possible to categorize different forms of collaborations and different types of players (depending on their degree of collaboration) ? How to explain the evolution of R&D collaboration, if any? Our results are as follows. First, the level of R&D collaboration in the RT in Japan is overall low and dominated by inter-firm collaborations; but it has increased between 1991 and 2004, especially in the case of collaboration between firms and universities. Second, R&D collaboration has apparently a positive impact on the quality of the patents, but should be more carefully investigated. Third, we find a significant heterogeneity across firms in the practices of collaborations (number of collaborations, choice of partners and "fidelity" with the partners). Fourth, these patterns are tentatively explained by the structural characteristics of the RT (by <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> a <b>transaction</b> cost argument and to the role of science-based technologies) and by firms' capabilities hypothesis; however, it is not possible to clearly identify if one theoretical hypothesis is better supported by the facts. ...|$|R
