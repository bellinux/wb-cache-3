5|$|After 1910, Sai Baba's fame {{began to}} spread in Mumbai. Numerous people started visiting him, because they <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as a saint {{with the power of}} {{performing}} miracles or even as an avatar. They built his first temple at Bhivpuri, Karjat.|$|E
5|$|After Baldwin sanctioned the marriage, Constance and Raynald {{married in}} early 1153. Raynald {{took charge of}} the {{administration}} of the principality. However, he was unpopular because his subjects <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as an upstart. His frequent attempts to raise funds brought him into conflict with Patriarch Aimery and Emperor ManuelI during the subsequent years. The emperor forced Raynald to pay homage to him in the spring of 1159. Raynald was captured and imprisoned by Majd al-Din, governor of Aleppo, during a plundering raid in November 1160 or 1161.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Edwin {{came to be}} venerated as a saint by some, {{although}} his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, {{who was killed in}} 642. They met their deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British, thus allowing both of them to be perceived as martyrs; however, Bede's treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that he <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as an unambiguously saintly figure, a status that he did not accord to Edwin.|$|E

50|$|Macchindranāth (or Bunga Dyah in Newari) {{is a god}} of rain worshiped by both Hindus and Buddhists in Nepal. Hindus <b>regard</b> <b>him</b> as an {{incarnation}} of Shiva while Buddhists <b>regard</b> <b>him</b> as an {{incarnation of}} Avalokiteśvara. The temple of Macchindranāth lies {{in the southern part}} of the Patan Durbar Square since 1673.|$|R
5|$|Between 1772 and 1779, Espejo {{provoked}} the colonial authorities, who <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as responsible for several satirical and mocking posters. These posters {{were attached to}} the doors of churches and other buildings, and their anonymous author tended to attack the colonial authorities, the clergy or any other subject he deemed convenient. Although no surviving posters have been found, evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests that he wrote them.|$|E
5|$|By {{writing for}} a {{scientific}} {{as well as}} popular audience, Beebe did much to make science accessible to the general public. This was particularly significant {{in the area of}} conservation, of which {{he was one of the}} most important early advocates. With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because they <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as a popularizer.|$|E
5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and could {{move quickly to}} catch balls hit some distance from him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> {{as one of the}} best slip fielders in England.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta was a {{divisive}} figure; prior to Kenyan independence, {{many of its}} white settlers <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, {{he was given the}} honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation. His rulership was criticised as dictatorial and authoritarian, of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of overseeing a growth in corruption and cronyism which have generated long-term problems for Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Trumble (12 May 1867 – 14 August 1938) was an Australian cricketer {{who played}} 32Test matches as a bowling all-rounder between 1890 and 1904. He captained the Australian team in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141wickets in Test cricket—a world record {{at the time}} of his retirement—at an average of 21.78runs per wicket. He is one of only four bowlers to twice take a hat-trick in Test cricket. Observers in Trumble's day, {{including}} the authoritative Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as ranking among the great Australian bowlers of the Golden Age of cricket. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1897 and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, established in 1996, inducted him in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Malhotra {{returned}} to the Wolf Pack the following season after failing to make the Rangers' roster out of training camp. With New York deep at the centre position, his AHL assignment was predicated on him learning to play wing. He received numerous call-ups to New York and finished the 2000–01 campaign with 11 points over 28 games in the AHL and 12 points over 50 games in the NHL. The season also marked a management change as Glen Sather took over as general manager, marking the departure of Smith, who had drafted Malhotra and <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as untradeable during his tenure.|$|E

5|$|Olaf and Thorgerd lived happily {{together}} at Hoskuldstead for some time. Around 962 Olaf's foster father Thord died, leaving Olaf his property and goðorð Olaf bought land {{and built a}} new homestead at Hjardarholt, which, according to the saga, he had to cleanse of the draugr of its former owner, Killer-Hrapp. As time went on people began to settle near Olaf's hall and <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as their goði. Olaf's ever-increasing wealth caused jealousy from Hoskuld's wife Jorunn. Around the same time Olaf and Thorgerd had a daughter, Thurid. Hjardarholt was renowned for its rich decorations; some two decades later, the skald Úlfr Uggason composed the famous poem Húsdrápa, about certain mythological scenes illustrated {{on the walls of}} Olaf's hall.|$|E
5|$|Otto, {{who was a}} {{grandson}} of BélaIV of Hungary, was crowned king, but only the Kőszegis and the Transylvanian Saxons <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as the lawful monarch. He was captured in Transylvania by Ladislaus Kán, who forced him to leave Hungary. The majority of the lords and prelates elected Charles Robert king at a Diet on October10, 1307. He was crowned king with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár by the Archbishop of Esztergom, as required by customary law, on August27, 1310. During the next decade, he launched a series of military campaigns against the oligarchs to restore royal authority. Charles Robert reunited the kingdom {{after the death of}} the most powerful lord, Mattheus Csák, which enabled him to conquer Csák's large province in the northeast of Hungary in 1321.|$|E
5|$|Pilcher {{spent his}} early {{career as an}} {{infantry}} officer, first seeing active service on colonial campaigns in Nigeria in the late 1890s followed by field command in the Second Boer War (1899–1902), on which he published a book of lessons learned in 1903. Following the war, he held a number of senior commands in India. However, further promotion was checked by his having come into conflict with his commander-in-chief, who <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as unsuited for senior command {{in part because of}} his writings; Pilcher was a keen student of the German army and its operational methods, and an active theorist who published a number of controversial books advocating the adoption of new military techniques as well as an anonymous invasion novel.|$|E

5|$|Some royal advisers, {{who were}} {{angered by the}} trust the king placed in Rosenberg, <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> with suspicion. For example, Walter M. Gibson, the Prime Minister of Hawaii, noted that King Kalākaua {{withheld}} most of the specific details of his conversations with Rosenberg from him. Kalākaua's autocracy and nativism, along with allegations of his corruption, convinced a powerful group of western businessmen and children of Christian missionaries that action should be taken against the king. This led to the June 1887 Constitution, which stripped Kalākaua of much of his power and significantly weakened the Hawaiian monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Stage {{magic is}} {{performed}} {{for an audience}} {{in a variety of}} media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, psychological manipulation, sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini, for example, <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as a magician.|$|E
5|$|With Andrew III's death, {{the male}} {{line of the}} House of Árpád became extinct, and a period of anarchy began. Charles Robert was crowned king with a {{provisional}} crown, but most lords and bishops refused to yield to him because they <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> {{as a symbol of}} the Holy See's attempts to control Hungary. They elected king the twelve-year-old Wenceslaus of Bohemia, who was descended from Béla IV of Hungary in the female line. The young king could not consolidate his position because many lords, especially those who held domains in the southern region of the kingdom, continued to support Charles Robert. Wenceslaus left Hungary for Bohemia in mid-1304. After he inherited Bohemia in 1305, he abandoned his claim to Hungary in favor of Otto III, Duke of Bavaria.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} University of Alabama, Applewhite moved to Houston, Texas, in 1965 {{to teach at}} the University of St. Thomas. His {{students}} <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as an engaging speaker and a stylish dresser. He served {{as chair of the}} music department; he also became a locally popular singer, serving as the choral director of an Episcopal church and performing with the Houston Grand Opera. In Texas, he was briefly openly gay but also pursued a relationship with a young woman, who left him under pressure from her family, greatly upsetting him. He resigned from the University of St. Thomas in 1970, citing depression and other emotional problems. Robert Balch and David Taylor, sociologists who studied Applewhite's group, speculate that this departure was prompted by another affair between Applewhite and a student. The president of the university later recalled that he was often mentally jumbled and disorganized {{near the end of his}} employment.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{evidence}} of Mercian {{involvement in the}} southeast {{there is very little}} indication that Æthelred had expansionist ambitions to the south. The increasing strength of the West Saxons under Cædwalla and Ine would have limited Mercian opportunities in that direction. The Northumbrians were no longer a distraction; they had been contained north of the Humber since the Battle of the Trent, and became even less of a threat after their disastrous defeat in 685 {{at the hands of the}} Picts. A possible explanation is that Æthelred was preoccupied with war with the Welsh. It was also at this time that the Hwicce came more definitely into the Mercian orbit. The last Hwiccean ruler to take the title of king was Oshere, who died in 685; but from the mid-670s he sought Æthelred's consent for his grants, and Æthelred <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as a subking. Further evidence of Æthelred's involvement among the Hwicce comes from a charter in which he grants land for a minster in Gloucestershire, in Hwiccean territory; the charter is generally thought to be a fabrication, but it appears to be based on an authentic earlier source.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both <b>regarded</b> <b>him</b> as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E
