5|$|The convoy {{had also}} been {{augmented}} by the United States government, in both cargo and shipping, as repayment for French financial, moral and military support during the American Revolution. In supporting the French Revolution in this way, the American government, urged especially by Ambassador Gouverneur Morris, was fulfilling its ten-year-old debt to France. Friendly <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and France did not long survive the Jay Treaty which came into effect in 1796; by 1798 the two nations would be engaged in the Quasi War.|$|E
5|$|The four-day {{whirlwind}} {{trip was}} launched on September 6, 1963, {{the same day}} as a National Security Council (NSC) meeting, and came in the wake of increasingly strained <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and South Vietnam. Civil unrest gripped South Vietnam as Buddhist demonstrations against the religious discrimination of President Ngô Đình Diệm's Catholic regime escalated. Following the raids on Buddhist pagodas on August 21 that left a death toll ranging up to a few hundred, the US authorized investigations into a possible coup through a cable to US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.|$|E

5|$|During {{the breakup}} of Yugoslavia, the United States engaged in both combative and {{economic}} conflict, particularly with Serbia, known {{at the time as}} the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (one of socialist Yugoslavia's successor states). The United States imposed sanctions and spearheaded a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999. During this period, another wave of Serbian emigration ensued, and many Serbian refugees moved to the United States. In the 2000s, diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Yugoslavia were restored, but were changed when Montenegro seceded in 2006, after which Serbia was the successor state to continue relations previously held by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in February 2008, a move which the US recognized.|$|E
5|$|The {{trip was}} {{intended}} to soften the strong isolationist tendencies among the North American public {{with regard to the}} developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public. The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor, Edward VIII, was dispelled. They visited the 1939 New York World's Fair and stayed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House and at his private estate at Hyde Park, New York. A strong bond of friendship was forged between the King and Queen and the President during the tour, which had major significance in the <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years.|$|E

25|$|Coca-Cola was {{introduced}} to China in 1927, and was very popular until 1949. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1949, the beverage was no longer imported into China, as it was perceived to be a symbol of decadent Western culture and the capitalist lifestyle. Importation and sales of the beverage resumed in 1979, after diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and China were restored.|$|E

25|$|Chinese people, {{except for}} those {{traveling}} or living outside China, rarely reverse their names to the western naming order (given name, then family name). Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name. Beginning in the early 1980s, in regards to people from Mainland China, western publications began using the Hanyu Pinyin romanization system instead of earlier romanization systems; this resulted from the normalization of diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and the People's Republic of China in 1979.|$|E

25|$|The early 1930s saw closer {{cooperation}} between the West and the USSR. From 1932 to 1934, the Soviet Union participated in the World Disarmament Conference. In 1933, diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and the USSR were established when in November, the newly elected President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to formally recognize Stalin's Communist government and negotiated a new trade agreement between the two nations. In September 1934, the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations. After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, the USSR actively supported the Republican forces against the Nationalists, who were supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.|$|E

500|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ) was formed. One of {{the first}} {{diplomatic}} contacts made with the new communist government was the US Department of State's request for the US Army to testify at the Mihailović trial. However, the request was shunned and early <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> {{and the government of}} Josip Broz Tito became strained, as American diplomats were furious over Mihailović's execution in 1946. Relations degraded even further a month later, when two USAF C-47 Skytrain cargo aircraft were shot down over Yugoslavia in the space of two weeks. More USAF aircraft were shot down over Yugoslavia up to 1948. As a result, U.S. senator Thomas Dodd staunchly opposed American financial aid to Tito's government, even saying that [...] "Tito had bloodied hands." [...] In one of Josip Broz Tito's early visits to the United States, protesters in San Pedro drowned an effigy of him.|$|E
