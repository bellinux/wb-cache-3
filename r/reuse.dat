25|$|Besides that, Article 12 of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive {{concerning}} the <b>reuse</b> of treated wastewater states that “treated wastewater shall be reused whenever appropriate”, is not specific enough to promote water <b>reuse</b> and it leaves too {{much room for}} interpretation as to what {{can be considered as}} an “appropriate” situation to <b>reuse</b> treated wastewater.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{financial}} {{motivation was}} one of the main drivers of <b>reuse.</b> In the developing world this driver can lead to very high levels of <b>reuse,</b> however rising wages and consequent consumer demand for the convenience of disposable products has made the <b>reuse</b> of low value items such as packaging uneconomic in richer countries, leading to the demise of many <b>reuse</b> programs. Current environmental awareness is gradually changing attitudes and regulations, such as the new packaging regulations, are gradually beginning to reverse the situation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Reuse</b> is {{the action}} or {{practice}} of using something again, whether for its original purpose (conventional <b>reuse)</b> or to fulfil a different function (creative <b>reuse</b> or repurposing).

40|$|Background: Various {{methods in}} H. pylori {{detection}} are available worldwide with different diagnostic accuracy. In theory, substrate {{that has not}} been consumed in a negative rapid urease test can be <b>reused.</b> We investigated the diagnostic accuracy between <b>reused</b> CLOtest® and <b>reused</b> Pronto Dry® in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM), located in the North Eastern of Peninsular Malaysia with a known low prevalence of H. pylori. Methods: A total of 410 adult patients with dyspepsia between March 2008 to June 2010 who underwent upper endoscopy needing rapid urease test on the basis of endoscopic findings were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The gastric biospsies were tested for new Pronto Dry®, <b>reused</b> Pronto Dry®,reused CLOtest® and histology. H. pylori infection was determined by either new Pronto Dry® or histology positive for H. pylori. Results: <b>Reused</b> CLOtest® has higher sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV (93 %, 99 %, 97 %, 99 % respectively) as compared to <b>reused</b> Pronto Dry® (72. 6 %, 98 %, 93 %, 94 % respectively). There was perfect kappa agreement between <b>reused</b> CLOtest® and new Pronto Dry®; 0. 941 (95 %CI, 0. 841 - 1. 037). The overall prevalence of H. pylori among dyspepsia patients who underwent upper endoscopy in HUSM was 17. 8 %(73 / 410). Younger age group, Chinese ethnicity, underlying gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, and gastric ulcers and duodenitis on histology were strongly associated with H. pylori infection in multivariate analysis (p-value< 0. 05). Conclusions: <b>Reused</b> CLOtest® is superior than <b>reused</b> Pronto Dry® on diagnostic accuracy. <b>Reused</b> CLOtest® can be considered {{to be used as a}} screening tool in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection in circumstances in which there are environmental and economic considerations to be taken into account...|$|R
