Starting from the general MVL case, we derive a computationally efficient algorithm for computing RM transforms for binary functions as well.

Fuzzy graphs, bipolar fuzzy graphs and the recently developed m-polar fuzzy graphs are growing research topics because they are generalizations of graphs (crisp). In this paper, three new operations, i. e., direct product, semi-strong product and strong product, are defined on m-polar fuzzy graphs. It is proved {{that any of the}} products of m-polar fuzzy graphs are again an m-polar fuzzy graph. Sufficient conditions are established for each to be strong, and it is proved that the strong product of two complete m-polar fuzzy graphs is complete. If any of the products of two m-polar fuzzy graphs G 1 and G 2 are strong, then at least G 1 or G 2 must be strong. Moreover, the density of an m-polar fuzzy graph is defined, the notion of balanced m-polar fuzzy graph is studied, and necessary and sufficient conditions for the preceding products of two m-polar fuzzy balanced graphs to be balanced are established. Finally, the concept of product m-polar fuzzy graph is introduced, and it is shown that every product m-polar fuzzy graph is an m-polar fuzzy graph.

Results for the sigma-meson are also discussed. Here, similarly to the rho-meson, mesonic intermediate states are essential. Besides, the relation of our model to hadronic models is discussed. In the last part of this thesis the behavior of the quark condensate at nonzero temperature is studied. In the low-temperature region agreement with the model independent chiral perturbation theory result in lowest order can be obtained.
