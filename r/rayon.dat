5|$|Barkley gets {{a police}} permit to raid the Buyers Club, but {{can do nothing}} but give Woodroof a fine. In 1987, the FDA changes its {{regulations}} such that any unapproved drug is also illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, <b>Rayon,</b> who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that <b>Rayon</b> died after being taken to the hospital. Dr. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she is linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug to be ineffective against HIV. She refuses to comply and insists {{that she would have}} to be fired.|$|E
5|$|The Mysore silk {{industry}} was first initiated during {{the rule of}} Tipu Sultan. Later the industry {{was hit by a}} global depression and competition from imported silk and <b>rayon.</b> In {{the second half of the}} 20th century, it however revived and the Mysore State became the top multivoltine silk producer in India.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{resources}} and fibres from plants {{are used to}} construct dwellings and to manufacture clothing. Wood is used not only for buildings, boats, and furniture, but also for smaller items such as musical instruments and sports equipment. Wood is pulped to make paper and cardboard. Cloth is often made from cotton, flax, ramie or synthetic fibres such as <b>rayon</b> and acetate derived from plant cellulose. Thread used to sew cloth likewise comes in large part from cotton.|$|E

5|$|The high melting point, {{hardness}} and {{corrosion resistance}} of iridium and its alloys determine {{most of its}} applications. Iridium and especially iridium–platinum alloys or osmium–iridium alloys have a low wear and are used, for example, for multi-pored spinnerets, through which a plastic polymer melt is extruded to form fibers, such as <b>rayon.</b> Osmium–iridium is used for compass bearings and for balances.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, 'A' Force (the Cairo-based {{department}} responsible for deception operations in the North Africa) had begun an operation, codenamed Cascade, to inflate {{the number of troops}} in the region by creating fictional divisions. By 1943 the use of notional formations had proved a useful part of deception operations, such as Operation <b>Rayon,</b> and the practice formed the basis for key parts of Bodyguard. The Allies invaded Italy in September 1943 {{and by the end of}} the year had occupied most of the south of the country. Thirty-eight divisions were deployed across the Mediterranean theatre, mostly in Italy with some in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Paton began {{construction}} of a wool factory at Darlington and a <b>Rayon</b> factory at Carrickfergus, both jobs were completed in 1951. In 1946 Paton {{was put in charge}} of an economic survey of Syria which required him to traverse the country by aircraft and car. The report, issued in 1947, recommended port, water infrastructure and irrigation improvements and the {{construction of}} a hydroelectric power station on the Euphrates River. Paton undertook a similar survey in Lebanon from 1947 to 1948. He was also involved in a report on the possibility of running a railroad from Northern Rhodesia to Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Nyasaland.|$|E

5|$|Kelbajar lay {{outside the}} contested enclave {{of the former}} Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, but within Nagorno-Karabakh {{geographic}} region of Azerbaijan, that Armenian and Azerbaijani forces had been fighting over for five years. The offensive {{was the first time}} Armenian forces from Nagorno-Karabakh had advanced beyond the boundaries of the enclave. Kelbajar <b>rayon,</b> located between Armenia and the western border of former NKAO, was composed of several dozen villages and its provincial capital, also named Kelbajar. According to Russian sources mountain troops from the 128th Regiment (7th Russian Army) stationed in Armenia participated in the seizure of Kelbajar in a blitzkrieg operation. After initial heavy resistance, the Azerbaijani defenses quickly collapsed and the provincial capital fell on April 3, 1993. Kelbajar is currently {{under the control of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of <b>Rayon</b> and Dr. Eve Saks were fictional; the writers had interviewed transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors {{for the film}} and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles. However, Woodroof did lose all his friends after they {{found out he was}} HIV-positive. In his interviews with Borten, Woodroof implied that this, along with interactions with gay people living with AIDS through the buyers club, led to a rethinking of his apparent anti-gay sentiments and changed his views on gay people. Other people who knew him said that he did not harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. Also, while a rodeo enthusiast, he never rode any bulls himself. Although the film shows Woodroof diagnosed in 1985, he told Borten that a doctor had informed him he might have had the disease well before that; Woodroof believed that he may have been infected in 1981, something that was briefly alluded to in a flashback in the film.|$|E
5|$|The company DuPont {{and many}} {{industrial}} historians dispute {{a link between}} nylon and hemp. They argue {{that the reason for}} developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with silk and <b>rayon</b> in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce. And the DuPont Group was very big; it could move on if nylon had not become a success.|$|E
