500|$|During the shooting, {{the crew}} had some {{problems}} in filming some scenes. Leto told MTV News, [...] "It's been an incredible adventure, but it's also been really difficult, {{because there are so}} many people, and we're shutting down streets of Los Angeles." [...] He further said that they were <b>really</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> a scene regarding a lone horse running down a Los Angeles street: [...] "We only had three takes that we had time to do. The first take it went sideways, second take it went the other way. Third take? Perfect." [...] Leto described the experience of filming the music video saying, [...] "It's a lyrical and slightly metaphorical surreal journey through the city of Angels, from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Pier. We like to create an adventure and this has been an adventure. [...] This is what we were supposed to do. And I doubted the idea up until the very last minute, but the process has been phenomenal."

500|$|No {{music video}} was filmed for {{promotion}} of [...] "Nothing Fails". Initially {{it was reported}} by Daily Mirror that Madonna planned to shoot the video in Israel with actor Michael Douglas. According to Polly Graham from the newspaper, Warner Bros. executives {{were concerned about the}} singer's safety in Israel, but Madonna was adamant. [...] "Her record bosses are <b>really</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> it. They are trying to talk her around, but she's having none of it. She has told them it makes sense to shoot it in Israel as the Kabbalah originates from there. Madonna is not particularly bothered about her safety and potential risks. She doesn't think it's as bad as it seems." [...] Her then husband Guy Ritchie was also facing difficulty with his project, Revolver, which was rejected by Sony Pictures executives since it contained references to Kabbalah, and they asked Ritchie to re-write the script. Since the video itself would have included symbolism from Kabbalah, Madonna ultimately decided to not film the music video. These reports were later refuted by the artist during an interview with San Francisco radio station Alice 97.3, where she explained that no music video would be shot for the single.|$|E
