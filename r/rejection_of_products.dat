40|$|Large {{numbers of}} {{measurements}} are {{being carried out}} in the industries and all the sectors of science and technology including environment, health, engineering and agriculture to ensure the quality of product and test results. Acceptance and <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> depends on the measurement values which provide the information that quality of the products is within the acceptable limits of the specification. Moreover, trading or controlling authorities related to health and environment sectors are also depends {{on the quality of the}} measurement value. This factor become very important when, the measurement value lies very near to the boundary line of the acceptable limits, because concerned trading agencies have to decide about the acceptance or <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> before their purchase or release into market for sale. Similarly in the health and medical sectors authorities have to decide to initiate the treatment of the patients on the basis of pathological tests and in environmental sectors to control the environment where permissible limits of pollutants/ constituents are in trace or ultra trace levels. Any small error/uncertainty in measurement may vitiate the cumulative effect of the action taken which has direct impact on the society. In present era of modernization many sophisticated equipment and measurement techniques are available which minimizes the errors/uncertainty in the measurements. But no technique is available for absolute measurement. Hence, all the measurement techniques and method of analysis are associated with some uncertainty value. Moreover method of analysis consists many steps of operation to measure the property value and all the steps of the method also consists some uncertainty, hence analyst has to identify and quantify all the sources of the uncertainty involved in all the steps of a particular test procedure. The combined value of all these uncertainties is termed as uncertainty in measurement. In view of this it is essential for concerned authorities to consider the uncertainty component of the measurement value before taking any decision about the acceptance or rejection of the products or initiating the medical treatment of the patients or taking steps to control the environmental pollution etc. The method of the estimation of uncertainty in chemical measurement is discussed in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{challenge}} {{in the development of}} infant formulas enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is to meet the consumers’ expectations with regard to high nutritional and sensory value. In particular, PUFAs may be prone to fatty acid oxidation that can generate potential rancid, metallic and/or fishy off-flavors. Although such off-flavors pose no health risk, they can nevertheless lead to <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> by consumers. Thus, monitoring autoxidation at its early stages is of great importance and finding a suitable analytical tool to perform these evaluations is therefore of high interest in quality monitoring. Two formulations of infant formulas were varied systematically in their mineral composition and their presence of antioxidants to produce 18 model formulas. All models were aged under controlled conditions and their oxidative deterioration was monitored. A quantitative study was performed on seven characteristic odor-active secondary oxidation products in the formulations via two-dimensional high resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (2 D-HRGC-MS/O). The sensitivity of the multi-dimensional GC-MS/O analysis was supported by two additional analytical tools for monitoring autoxidation, namely the analysis of lipid hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes. Furthermore, an aroma profile analysis (APA) was performed to reveal the presence and intensities of typical odor qualities generated in the course of fatty acid oxidation. The photometrical analyses of lipid hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes were found to be too insensitive for early indication of the development of sensory defects. By comparison, the 2 D-HRGC-MS/O was capable of monitoring peroxidation of PUFAs at low ppb-level in its early stages. Thereby, it was possible to screen oxidative variances on the basis of such volatile markers already within eight weeks after production of the products, which is an earlier indication of oxidative deterioration than achievable via conventional methods. In detail, oxidative variances between the formulations revealed that lipid oxidation was low when copper was administered in an encapsulated form and when antioxidants (vitamin E, ascorbyl palmitate) were present...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{article is}} a part of a twin study. Drawing on the {{available}} evidence, in this paper the author examines the cost of compliance with Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures for poor countries with reference to Africa. He shows that the burden of cost of compliance is entirely on the exporters despite the fact that their capacity for the compliance is limited. He further indicate that that, in fact, the literature often disregards the cost of loss of exports, or <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> at the border of an importing country, let alone the cost of reorganization of the supply chain; the existing organization of supply chain in poor countries would result in the lack of export expansion. The purpose of the paper is not to have an exhaustive literature survey, but to draw on the scanty evidence related to the main argument of the study. More specifically, it is shown that the main characteristics of the SPS Agreement and the related measures applied by main importing countries are such that they require a complex, difficult and high cost “SPS” system. Such a system involves regulatory measures, policy re-orientation, and development of the necessary infrastructure, re-organization of the supply chain, enhanced capacity building and a forward looking strategy, particularly for exports. The preparation for the compliance is also difficult for the poor countries as it is knowledge intensive, requires a learning period, training and a close cooperation between the public and private sector in various stages of the supply chain. Yet the socio-economic cost of the lack of compliance is enormous. Generally speaking, the operational cost, alone, of compliance is estimated to be between 2 to 11 percent of value of export in the case of Africa; in each case it depends, however, on the type of product, the destination of exports, the capacity of the country for the compliance and the size of farm holdings and exporting enterprises and the organization of the supply chain. Further, the investment cost can be colossal; in some cases (e. g Mozambique) exceeding the total food exports of the country. The available studies provide estimates for the administrative cost of control, inspection, testing and certification at the border; but disregard more important costs such as the costs of delays in exportation or rejection at the port of importing countries. Thus they downplay the need for taking preventive measures and the related cost of reorganization of the supply chain. In a separate paper the author proposes alternative organization of the supply chain for reducing the cost of compliance while increasing its benefits (Shafaeddin, 2007). 2 SPS, Agricultural development, food policy, economic development, export expansion, trade, Ethiopia...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine different uncertainties between design, manufacture and measurement in surface texture by carrying out a deeply discussion and seeking possible evaluation methods. The analysis of correlation uncertainty, specification uncertainty and measurement uncertainty is carried out. All possible contribute elements of the uncertainties are listed and examined with presently available knowledge. The relationships and management between these uncertainties are discussed based on the requirements <b>of</b> Geometrical <b>Product</b> Specifications (GPS). It concludes that a rigorous control of specification uncertainty in the early stage of the design process can significantly reduce the cost and avoid later disputes over acceptance or <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>product.</b> A management method to reduce specification uncertainty based on comprehensive analyse is proposed. A statistical evaluation method of the specification uncertainty for a specified case is proposed and tested.
