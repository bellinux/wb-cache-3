High penetration of photovoltaic into the existing distribution networks might result in voltage increase in case renewable source generation crosses the demand on the consumer side. To deal with this challenge, use of energy storage systems is done and integrated with the renewable source generation. The excess energy generated from photovoltaic charges, the storage system during the day-time and the same stored energy helps in reducing the evening peak load. The energy storage system helps in reducing the intermittent issue of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> generation.
