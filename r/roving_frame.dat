40|$|Systematic {{control of}} the {{rheological}} behavior of the ravings in an installation facility dynamometer constant elongation gradient is proposed in this paper. It is an application {{for all types of}} spinning both shortfibers as long fibers. Industrial experiments conducted show that this control drawing of the spinning frame is optimized, getting more regular yarns mass with greater industrial profitability. This work is applied to a spinning worsted manufactures fine yarns with high quality requirement The fundamental thesis of our work is that the rheological {{control of the}} roving, output from <b>roving</b> <b>frame,</b> either torsional or friction, helps to increase the profitability of the spinning frame and get higher quality yarns. Rheology is the science of movement of the fibers within a fibrous vein, is a sliver or roving from the graph tribocharging-elongation another fundamental concept appears in our analysis: the isocarric elongation. Empirically, we defined this elongation as the difference between the elongation percentage corresponding to half the determined maximum tribocharge on the ascending and descending branches of the tribo-charging elongation curve. The application of these techniques to former machines to <b>roving</b> <b>frame</b> in conventional wool process also allows us to adjust the machines with more speed, reducing the time and product (waste) required a change in manufacturing. To increase, for example, the feed of a gill, increase the difficult y for drafting in the following step. These difficulties are directly related to the value of the doubling and drafting that applies: the more doubling and drafting, the greater the difficulty in later steps...|$|E
25|$|In 1850 {{the mill}} had some 276 carding machines, and 77,000 mule spindles, 20 drawing frames, fifty {{slubbing}} frames and eighty one <b>roving</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Brunswick Mill {{was one of}} {{the largest}} in Britain at that time and by the 1850s held some 276 carding machines, and 77,000 mule spindles, 20 drawing frames, fifty {{slubbing}} frames and eighty one <b>roving</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|For machine processing, a roving {{is about}} {{the width of a}} pencil. The rovings are {{collected}} in a drum and proceed to the slubbing frame which adds twist, and winds onto bobbins. Intermediate Frames are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn, and then the <b>roving</b> <b>frames</b> reduces it to a finer thread, gives more twist, makes more regular and even in thickness, and winds onto a smaller tube.|$|R
50|$|Swan Lane Mills {{are typical}} of {{the final phase of}} cotton mill {{construction}} in Lancashire, of vast size and decorated with flamboyant terracotta embellishments reflecting the industry's prominence and prosperity. The mill was planned as a double mill with a central boiler house and built in two phases. Swan Lane Number 1 Mill was built in 1902, and Number 2 Mill three years later. The double mill was built to contain 210,000 mule spindles. Number 3 Mill was built in 1915 and housed 120,000 mule spindles. Number 1 Mill spun fine counts using Sea Island Cotton and Number 2 Mill concentrated on medium counts using Egyptian cotton.The mill also had 250 carding and 200 drawing and <b>roving</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|Textile {{manufacturing}} involves converting {{of three}} types of fibre into yarn, then fabric, then textiles. These are then fabricated into clothes or other artifacts. Cotton {{was the most important}} natural fibre, but there was a sizeable Worsted industry in neighbouring West Yorkshire. Cotton was harvested, ginned and transported Britain in bales. At the factories the bales were broken open, the fibres were willowed and scrutched before being carded. The carded fibres were combed, drawn, slubbed and roved before they were ready to be spun. Spinning was done on a spinning mule. Before mechanisation each process was done by hand, but as 19th progressed mechanization was introduced. From 1857, Platts supplied the complete range of spinning and weaving machinery. It surpassed Dobson & Barlow of Bolton in size in 1854. Platts constructed looms for export from 1857. Platts introduced successive models of carding machines, <b>roving</b> <b>frames</b> and self-acting mules in 1868, 1886 and 1900. The self-acting mule was the basis of the company's success being faster, longer and more productive than those of their rivals. Workmen in Platts became shareholders in the Oldham Limiteds mills on the late 1860s ensuring Platt machinery was purchased.|$|R
60|$|As for Janet, {{she was as}} one brought {{suddenly}} to the realization of a miracle in whose presence she had lived {{for many years and}} never before suspected; the miracle of machinery, of the triumph of man over nature. In the brief space of an hour she beheld the dirty bales flung off the freight cars on the sidings transformed into delicate fabrics wound from the looms; cotton that only last summer, perhaps, while she sat typewriting at her window, had been growing in the fields of the South. She had seen it torn by the bale-breakers, blown into the openers, loosened, cleansed, and dried; taken up by the lappers, pressed into batting, and passed on to the carding machines, to emerge like a wisp of white smoke in a sliver and coil automatically in a can. Once more it was flattened into a lap, given to a comber that felt out its fibres, removing with superhuman precision those for the finer fabric too short, thrusting it forth again in another filmy sliver ready for the drawing frames. Six of these gossamer ropes were taken up, and again six. Then came the Blubbers and the <b>roving</b> <b>frames,</b> twisting and winding, the while maintaining the most delicate of tensions lest the rope break, running the strands together into a thread constantly growing stronger and finer, until it was ready for spinning.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} houses the six stage blowing {{room where the}} fibres are opened, plucked, cleaned and blended: with bale {{breakers}} (openers, bale pluckers), carding machines, a drawframe to draught the sliver, a lapformer, a comber to remove the short fibres, a speedframe to attenuate further and wrap the lap onto <b>roving</b> bobbins. The <b>frames</b> are by Toyota Truetzschler.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{to the concept of}} lunar mining and the use of in situ oxygen, metallics, and ceramics is presented. The EVA time required to set up, relocate, and maintain equipment, as well as the cost per pound of shipping the mining and processing equipment to the moon are considered. The proposed soil fracturing/loading mechanisms are all based loosely on using the Apollo Lunar <b>Roving</b> Vehicle (LRV) <b>Frame.</b> All use motor driven tracks for mobility in the forward/reverse and left/right direction. All mechanisms employ the concept of rototillers which are attached to a gantry which, through the use of motor-driven lead screws, provide the rototillers with an up/down capability. A self-reactant excavator, a local mass enhanced excavator, and a soil reactant excavator are illustrated...|$|R
5000|$|The {{site was}} {{originally}} {{used as a}} brick works; it was purchased in 1781, by Arkwright and his partners.Simpsons Mill was a five storey, Arkwright type mill 9.1 m wide and 60.9m long. It housed water frames, carding machines and <b>roving</b> and drawing <b>frames</b> using designs patented by Arkwright. It was driven by a 9.1 m diameter waterwheel driven from the upper storage pond. A steam engine drove a water pump to send the water back to the upper pond. It is thought that the steam engine was of the Newcomen type, though some sources speculate {{that it could have}} been of the Savery type. The pump had two cylinders, 31 in in diameter and a stroke of 93 in â€” the steam cylinder was 64 in in diameter. It operated at 11-12 strokes per minute. It used 5 tonnes of coal a day. It was perhaps because of this excessive coal consumption, that it was supplemented in 1790 with a 6 hp, Boulton and Watt rotative engine. They ran 4,000 spindles. A year later in 1791 they ordered a 40 hp rotative engine to replace them. This was the largest engine that Boulton and Watt had made at that time, and it was operating by the end of the summer in 1792[...] A further 30 hp Boulton and Watt was bought in 1799. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1854.|$|R
