25|$|In {{half-wave}} rectification of a single-phase supply, also called uncontrolled one-pulse midpoint circuit, either the {{positive or negative}} half of the AC wave is passed, while the other half is blocked. Mathematically, it is a <b>ramp</b> <b>function</b> (for positive pass, negative block): passing positive corresponds to the <b>ramp</b> <b>function</b> being the identity on positive inputs, blocking negative corresponds to being zero on negative inputs. Because only one half of the input waveform reaches the output, mean voltage is lower. Half-wave rectification requires a single diode in a single-phase supply, or three in a three-phase supply. Rectifiers yield a unidirectional but pulsating direct current; half-wave rectifiers produce far more ripple than full-wave rectifiers, and much more filtering is needed to eliminate harmonics of the AC frequency from the output.|$|E

With {{the assumption that}} all the constituent events of a multiple shock have identical fault geometry and depth, the far-field source time function is obtained as a superposition of <b>ramp</b> <b>functions.</b> The height and the onset time of the <b>ramp</b> <b>functions</b> are determined by matching the synthetic waveforms with the observed ones in the least-square sense.

2500|$|A sonomicrometer device {{measures}} distance {{by performing}} a timing {{measurement of the}} sound transmitted by one crystal and received by one (or more) adjacent crystals. [...] The ability to resolve small differences in this transit-time (or [...] "time-of-flight") directly correlates {{with the ability to}} resolve small changes in the distances between crystals. [...] The first generation of sonomicrometer devices were analog devices that integrated the time-of-flight as a voltage <b>ramp</b> <b>function.</b> [...] Their resolution was a function of the slope of the ramp and the electrical noise of system components. [...] Those systems output the length measurements as an analog voltage. [...] The second generation of sonomicrometer devices were digital—they measure time-of-flight by incrementing high-speed digital counters. [...] Typically these are 12 to 16-bit counters operating from 32 to 128MHz. [...] A digital system will output length measurements in form of a digital number (the time-of-flight count value). [...] Because of their digital nature, the resolution can be exactly specified as a function of counter clock frequency. [...] For example, when making measurements in biological tissue at body temperature (velocity = 1,590m/s), a digital sonomicrometer operating with a clock speed of 128MHz will have a spatial resolution of 12 micrometres.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations (DNS) {{have been}} conducted of the flow over NACA- 0006 and NACA- 0012 airfoils. The airfoil flows {{have been found to}} exhibit pronounced tran- sitional phenomena and multiple sources of noise have been observed. Data transformed to the frequency domain, and third-octave averaged, reveal that for low frequencies, the contribution of trailing edge noise radiation is significant while for the high frequencies the radiated noise appears to be due only to the flow events in the transition/reattachment region on the suction side. Cross-correlations of acoustic and hydrodynamic quantities, combined with ray-acoustic theory, are shown to identify the main source locations. Even though the cross-correlation maps capture the trailing edge contribution, the highest cor- relation with the farfield observer locations is found in the transition/reattachment region, implying that this is the main source region for the transitional cases investigated here. Surface pressure peaks associated with the transitional behavior lead to decreased accuracy when predicting self-noise using classical trailing edge theory based on surface pressure dif- ference. Using data from the DNS the application of <b>ramping</b> <b>functions</b> to Amiet's surface pressure jump function are evaluated.

40|$|Phases {{of insulin}} release were {{studied in the}} perfused {{pancreas}} during a variety of glucose stimulation patterns. Patterns included staircase stimulations, constant prolonged single steps, restimulations, and <b>ramp</b> <b>functions.</b> Except at low concentrations, prolonged single steps of glucose elicited early spikes of insulin and a slowly rising second phase. Total insulin in the initial spikes increased with higher glucose concentrations. However, the time-related pattern of these spikes was similar in all cases; ratios of initial secretion rate to total insulin released were constant. Total insulin released in this early phase approximated a sigmoidal function of glucose concentration; mathematical differentiation of this function gave a skewed bell-shaped distribution curve. Staircase stimulations caused insulin to be released {{as a series of}} transient spikes which did not correlate with the increment of glucose but rather to the available insulin for a given glucose concentration minus that released in previous steps. The sum of total insulin released as spikes in a staircase series leading to a given glucose concentration was the same as when that concentration was used as a single step. Interrupted prolonged glucose infusions indicated the second phase of insulin release could prime the pancreas and that the first and second phases were interrelated. When glucose was perfused as <b>ramp</b> <b>functions</b> of slow, increasing, concentration, phasic response disappeared...|$|R
