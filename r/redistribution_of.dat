5|$|This division, {{established}} by Augustus in 22BC, {{was accompanied by}} a <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> tribal settlement areas.

5|$|A {{central part}} of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument {{was based on the}} premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they could pay for government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E
5|$|A further <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> shares {{took place}} in April 1996, when China National Aviation Corporation {{purchased}} 35.86 percent of Dragonair and became the largest shareholder, with Cathay Pacific and Swire retaining 25.50 percent, CITIC Pacific retaining 28.50 percent and the Chao family retaining 5.02 percent. CNAC's holding was further increased to 43 percent when it was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 17 December 1997. On 5 July 1998, Dragonair Flight 841 from Chongqing was the last scheduled arrival at Kai Tak Airport, landed runway 13 at 15:38 GMT (23:38 Hong Kong time).|$|E
5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E

5|$|By an Act of 1837 {{government}} of the town was entrusted to a board of Improvement Commissioners, elected by the ratepayers. A Local Board was formed in 1872, and lasted until Whitby Urban District Council was formed under the Local Government Act 1894. The townships of Whitby, Ruswarp and Hawsker-cum-Stainsacre were formed into a Parliamentary borough under the Reform Act of 1832 returning one member until the <b>Redistribution</b> <b>of</b> Seats Act 1885.|$|E
5|$|From 1295 to 1868, Dorchester was a {{parliamentary}} constituency. This was abolished by the <b>Redistribution</b> <b>of</b> Seats Act 1885, after which Dorchester {{was placed in}} the new Dorset South constituency and in 1918 it was transferred to Dorset West, where it has remained ever since. Dorchester is represented by three tiers of government. Dorchester Town Council, West Dorset District Council and Dorset County Council, all of which are based within the town. The Member of Parliament for West Dorset is Oliver Letwin.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald {{consistently}} {{called for}} a more equitable <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> wealth, so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia, could share fully in Canada's prosperity. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald deserves credit for the introduction, in 1957, of an equalization scheme designed to enable poorer provinces to provide comparable levels of services to their citizens. Macdonald's advocacy of provincial autonomy however, fell victim to the centralizing tendencies of a post-war welfare state in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs.|$|E
5|$|Peterborough {{sent two}} members to {{parliament}} {{for the first}} time in 1547. Before the civil war, many were relatives of the clergy; then for two hundred years after the restoration there was always a Fitzwilliam, or a Fitzwilliam nominee, sitting as member for Peterborough, making it a Whig stronghold. Representation was reduced to one member under the <b>Redistribution</b> <b>of</b> Seats Act 1885.|$|E

5|$|Tiberius {{was elected}} to the office of Tribune of the Plebs in 133 BC. He {{immediately}} began pushing for a programme of land reform, partly by invoking the 240-year-old Sextian-Licinian law that limited the amount of land that could be owned by a single individual. Using the powers of Lex Hortensia, Tiberius established a commission to oversee the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> land holdings from the rich to the unlanded urban poor. The commission consisted of himself, his father-in-law and his brother Gaius.|$|E
5|$|Wigan {{is in the}} Wigan Parliamentary {{constituency}}, {{which was}} recreated in 1547 after having covered the borough in the late 13th century. From 1640 until the <b>Redistribution</b> <b>of</b> Seats Act 1885, the constituency returned two Members of Parliament (MPs); from then on it had only one. Since 1918, the constituency has been represented by the Labour Party. Lisa Nandy is the incumbent Member of Parliament for Wigan, having been elected in the 2010 general election.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{approved}} of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive Whigs, though {{he was concerned about}} the implications of their Reform Bill which proposed the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of the franchise. In the event, the Reform Act 1832 was to bring more abolitionist MPs into Parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery. In addition, the 1832 slave revolt in Jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition was essential to avoid further rebellion.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} simple, widely-held {{hypothesis}} that an exogenous real home currency depreciation enhances {{the competitiveness of}} home country manufacturers vis á vis foreign rivals. The study associates changes in competitiveness with <b>redistributions</b> <b>of</b> value within an industry. Daily and weekly data on <b>redistributions</b> <b>of</b> value are obtained from world financial markets. The study estimates the relationship between changes in exchange rates and <b>redistributions</b> <b>of</b> value within the world automobile and steel industries during the period 1978 - 87. The data generally {{do not support the}} notion that firms benefit competitively from a depreciation of the home currency. On the contrary, for large fractions of both industries, a depreciation of the home currency is associated with a significant decline in their share of industry value. © 1991 JIBS.

50|$|It {{might be}} argued that since such <b>redistributions</b> <b>of</b> {{resources}} are not observed now, why would either Rawlsian or utilitarian constructs be appropriate for climate change (Arrow et al., 1996b, p. 140)?

5|$|Although {{only a small}} affray, it {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} some important people; viz. the Duke of Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland, and Lord Clifford. It has been suggested that, whilst Somerset might have been targeted by York, the latter too might have been intentionally slain by the Neville brothers. It was John who, after the battle, appears to have been responsible for the victorious Duke of York removing Sir William Skipwith from the household offices the latter held of the Duke. Neville was said to have achieved this by pointing out how Skipwith failed to join York in battle; John Neville subsequently shared in the profits of York's <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> Skipwith's ex-offices.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} after the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> population {{as a result of}} the clearances and the industrial revolution that began in the eighteenth century, the population was evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Most of the early modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. One result of the Little Ice Age was the abandonment of marginal land in the early part of the period, as it became impossible to sustain agriculture in some regions, particularly in the uplands, but new settlements were created {{as a result of the}} opening up of hunting reserves like Ettrick Forest and less desirable low-lying land was also settled, often incorporating features into their names such as bog, marsh and muir.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} after the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> population in the later clearances and the industrial revolution, these numbers would have been evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of many burghs that {{grew up in the}} later medieval period, mainly in the east and south. It has been suggested that they would have had a mean population of about 2,000, but many would be much smaller than 1,000 and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 {{at the beginning of the}} modern era and by 1750, with its suburbs it had reached 57,000. The only other towns above 10,000 by the end of the period were Glasgow with 32,000, Aberdeen with around 16,000 and Dundee with 12,000.|$|E

The model shows that a system <b>of</b> centralized <b>redistribution</b> can lead to less efficient outcomes if labor or capital are not mobile; and an inefficient outcome, with incomplete or no factor mobility, receives a majority of votes in both countries, whenever the structure of labor markets is very different in the two countries. ...|$|R
