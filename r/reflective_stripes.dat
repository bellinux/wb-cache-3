25|$|The {{design is}} easily {{confused}} with Phase IV designs, {{although there are}} several differences between Phase IV and Phase VI. The Phase VI stripes are {{the same size and}} arrangement as Phase IV, however the blue is lighter, not a purple-like color, and is the same blue used for Phase V. The current Amtrak Travelmark logo is displayed in white or blue depending on where it is located on the car. The car number and car type lettering are much smaller than on previous paint schemes with Frutiger replacing the previous Helvetica typeface. On the skirt of the car, there is usually a red <b>reflective</b> <b>stripe,</b> the same as on Phase V. Although not used on any locomotives, Phase VI has been applied to just about every type of Amtrak passenger car used today, including Superliner, Amfleet, Horizon, and the remaining Heritage equipment (though a small number of cars remain in older paint schemes in rail yards and at railroad museums). Phase VI has not been applied on any of Amtrak's locomotives as it was designed to correspond with Phase V locomotives.|$|R
40|$|Specimens of Tubulanus riceae {{new species}} (Nemertea: Palaeonemertea) were {{collected}} from a Phragmatopoma worm reef in the surf zone at Fort Pierce (Florida, USA) and from sublittoral rubble at Carrie Bow Cay (Belize) and Bocas del Toro (Panama). They have well-developed lateral sensory organs, form a cellophane-like tube and appear to have ocelli-like structures. The latter, if confirmed as ocelli, {{would be the first}} reported for a tubulanid. The new species is characterized by a unique color pattern, resembling that of Tubulanus rhabdotus, but it is distinctive in its milky-tan ground color with annular bands of brown pigment bounded by white margins and in having up to six to eight dorsal, longitudinal, but broken, <b>reflective</b> white <b>stripes...</b>|$|R
