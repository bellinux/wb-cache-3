2500|$|When two {{boats are}} used (pair trawling), the <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> {{of the net}} is {{provided}} by the boats, with one {{or in the case of}} pelagic trawling two [...] attached to each boat. However, single-boat trawling is more common. Here, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> of the net is provided by trawl doors (also known as [...] "otter boards"). Trawl doors are available in various sizes and shapes and may be specialized to keep in contact with the sea bottom (bottom trawling) or to remain elevated in the water. In all cases, doors essentially act as wings, using a hydrodynamic shape to provide <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread.</b> As with all wings, the towing vessel must go at a certain speed for the doors to remain standing and functional. This speed varies, but is generally in the range of 2.5–4.0 knots.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{gravimetric}} {{moisture content}} of peat {{is the main}} factor limiting the ignition and spread propagation of smouldering fires. Our aim is to use controlled laboratory experiments to better understand how the spread of smouldering fires is influenced in natural landscape conditions where the moisture content of the top peat layer is not homogeneous. In this paper, we study {{for the first time}} the spread of peat fires across a spatial matrix of two moisture contents (dry/wet) in the laboratory. The experiments were undertaken using an open-top insulated box (22 × 18 × 6 cm) filled with milled peat. The peat was ignited at one side of the box initiating smouldering and <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread.</b> Measurements of the peak temperature inside the peat, fire duration and longwave thermal radiation from the burning samples revealed important local changes of the smouldering behaviour in response to sharp gradients in moisture content. Both, peak temperatures and radiation in wetter peat (after the moisture gradient) were sensitive to the drier moisture condition (preceding the moisture gradient). Drier peat conditions before the moisture gradient led to higher temperatures and higher radiation flux from the fire during the first 6 cm of <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> into a wet peat patch. The total spread distance into a wet peat patch was affected by the moisture content gradient. We predicted that in most peat moisture gradients of relevance to natural ecosystems the fire self-extinguishes within the first 10 cm of <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> into a wet peat patch. Spread distances of more than 10 cm are limited to wet peat patches below 160 % moisture content (mass of water per mass of dry peat). We found that spatial gradients of moisture content have important local effects on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> and should be considered in field and modelling studies...|$|R

40|$|Common {{shrimp trawl}} designs {{employed}} in the southeastern United States shrimp fishery are the flat, balloon, semiballoon, jib, and super X- 3. Recent innovations in trawl design and rigging, including the twin trawl rigging and tongue trawl design, have improved the efficiency of shrimp trawling gear. A description of the construction techniques for the different designs indicate differences which affect gear performance. Measurements of <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> and vertical opening for 76 trawl configurations indicate the relative efficiencies of the different designs. Maximum <b>horizontal</b> <b>spreading</b> efficiency was achieved by the "twin" and "tongue" trawl designs followed by the super X- 3, jib, balloon, and semiballoon designs. Designs having the greatest vertical openings were the tongue and flat trawl designs followed by the semiballoon. Maximum total gape dimension was demonstrated by the "Mongoose" tongue trawl. Comparison of trawl spreading efficiency and door area to headrope length ratio indicates that a range of 70 - 80 in square (per door) of door area is required for each foot of trawl headrope length for maximum efficiency with conventional trawl designs and 66 - 75 in square per foot of headrope for tongue trawl designs.

40|$|SUMMARY: Two gravity-driven tectonic {{processes}} {{are common in}} orogenic belts, such as the Scandinavian Caledonides. (1) The rise of buoyant granitoid basement {{in the form of}} domes and diapirs into the column of geosynclinal metasediments and metalavas. In the Scandinavian Caledonides some of the nappes also acted as a buoyancy-inducing overburden. This is particularly true for the heavy Seve nappe. (2) The gravitational collapse of the pile of supracrustals and nappes. The collapse is associated with a <b>horizontal</b> <b>spreading</b> which contri-butes to the horizontal displacement of the thrust sheets. In the Scandinavian Caledonides there are numerous examples of basement diapirism, particularly among the ‘Nordland granites’, but also within the huge More-gneiss complex in SW Norway. Closer to {{the eastern edge of the}} chain the basement was less hot and plastic during the orogenesis, and cataclastic conditions prevailed during the rise of the row of peripheral uplifts extending parallel to the belt. Evidence of <b>horizontal</b> <b>spreading</b> and vertical shortening of some of the nappes is found in the form of boudinage, mineral lineation and prevailing horizontal schistosity over large regions within the nappes. The collapse-spreading process has been treated theoretically and experimentally, but experimental results are only briefly mentioned...|$|R

25|$|Ice {{sheets and}} glaciers are flowing ice masses that rest on solid land. They are {{controlled}} by snow accumulation, surface and basal melt, calving into surrounding oceans or lakes and internal dynamics. The latter results from gravity-driven creep flow ("glacial flow") within the ice body and sliding on the underlying land, which leads to thinning and <b>horizontal</b> <b>spreading.</b> Any imbalance of this dynamic equilibrium between mass gain, loss and transport due to flow results in either growing or shrinking ice bodies.|$|R
50|$|Trace gas {{exchanges between}} the upper {{troposphere}} {{and the lower}} stratosphere occur due to large air mass movements.

Regarding the <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread,</b> the extratropical air in the stratosphere, is mixed towards the equator at the outer edge of the Asian monsoon anticyclone, thus affecting the concentration of trace gases in the area.|$|R
40|$|The medium {{range spread}} of {{a cloud of}} {{material}} released in a turbulent wind is considered theoretically. Attention is directed {{to the effect of}} systematic wind shear with height to see whether this may be important. It is shown that there are two cases, according to whether the height to which the material may rise is effectively bounded or not. In the first case when the height is bounded, the situation is in essentials the same as for flow in a pipe (Taylor 1953, 1954). After a sufficient length of time, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> is described by a diffusivity which is the linear sum of two components, one representing the effect of horizontal turbulent fluctuations of the wind, and the other the effect of an interaction between the systematic wind shear and the vertical transport of material by the turbulence. For given mean wind profile, the latter effect is proportional in an inverse way to the coefficient of vertical diffusion. In the second case, when the material may rise to any height, it is shown that the <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> cannot be described, in general, by a constant diffusivity, and that the <b>horizontal</b> mean-square <b>spread</b> or dispersion does not increase linearly with the time. However, the horizontal fluctuations and the interaction of wind shear with vertical transport still contribute independently to the horizontal dispersion. It is found that the interaction effect now depends in a direct way on the coefficient of vertical diffusion. It is also concluded that for medium-range diffusion the effect of the interaction of wind shear with vertical transport is dominant...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{aminoglycoside}} apramycin {{has been}} used extensively in animal husbandry in the UK since 1978. This study aimed to determine both whether calves {{that had never been}} treated with amino-glycoside antibiotics harboured apramycin-resistant (aprR) commensal Escherichia coli, and the mode of spread of the resistance gene. Methods: AprR E. coli from weekly calf faecal samples were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, antibiotic resistance phenotype, plasmid restriction profiles and plasmid transfer frequencies. Results: During 4 months of weekly sampling, six of 11 calves were found to harbour aprR E. coli. All aprR E. coli (45) were cross-resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin, which are both used in human medicine. Resistance was conferred by the aac(3) IV gene, present on three different conjugative plas-mids. Two of these plasmids also mediated tetracycline and streptomycin resistance. One plasmid demonstrated very high transfer frequencies and was found in three different genotypes. Conclusions: We report the presence of aprR commensal E. coli in cattle that have never been treated with aminoglycosides. The presence of one conjugative plasmid in three different genotypes is evi-dence of <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> of this plasmid.
