40|$|To dissect {{the most}} {{important}} determinant <b>of</b> wheat <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality,</b> gluten protein-types from 128 flours of organically grown German wheat varieties Bussard and Orestis were investigated by quantitative HPLC and SDS-PAGE procedures using protein standards. Both varieties exhibit great differences in gluten strength (> 34 %) at two locations and between two years determined by SDS-sedimentation volume (SDS-SV), a measure <b>of</b> <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> Unexpectedly, {{the results showed that}} neither concentrations of gliadin, gluten, HMW-glutenin or glutenin could explain the observed variation in SDS-SV even if protein concentrations were equal. In the case of glutenin this was found to be due to a low glutenin recovery resulting from a partial insolubility of glutenin in propanol (protein recoveries from 78 % to 95 %). Further investigations under the conditions of a complete glutenin extraction led to the identification and characterization of glutenin macropolymer (GMP) which affected the <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> wheat significantly. This effect was associated with higher molecular weights of GMP which may cause growing gluten networks compared to simple glutenin. Moreover, it was finally shown that quantitatively the concentrations of GMP (mg/ 100 mg flour) were independent of protein concentrations. Our results demonstrate that, for the flour samples used, the flour GMP concentration is a key determinant, and together with the SDS-SV a reliable tool for <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> prediction...|$|R
40|$|The {{variation}} and path coefficient analysis <b>of</b> <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> traits {{have been studied}} for 145 genotypes of breeding lines, cultivars and landrace varieties of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). <b>Bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> traits <b>of</b> genotypes was evaluated indirectly by protein percentage, SDS and Zeleny sedimentation tests, hardness index, test weight, bread volume, grain moisture, and water absorption percentage. Hardness index, Zeleny and SDS sedimentation tests had the highest coefficient of variability (13. 51 %, 11. 83 % and 11. 03 %, respectively). Factor analysis for the genotypes, based on qualitative traits revealed two factors, which explain 98. 23 % of total {{variation and}} were named grain protein index and bread volume factors.

40|$|The <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> wheat is {{strongly}} influenced by multiple low molecular weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) proteins expressed in the seeds. However, the organization, recombination and expression of LMW-GS genes and their functional mechanism in bread-making are not well understood. Here we report a systematic molecular analysis of LMW-GS genes located at the orthologous Glu- 3 loci (Glu-A 3, B 3 and D 3) of bread wheat using complementary approaches (genome wide characterization of gene members, expression profiling, proteomic analysis). Fourteen unique LMW-GS genes were identified for Xiaoyan 54 (with superior <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality).</b> Molecular mapping and recombination analyses revealed that the three Glu- 3 loci of Xiaoyan 54 harbored dissimilar numbers of LMW-GS genes and covered different genetic distances. The number of expressed LMW-GS in the seeds was higher in Xiaoyan 54 than in Jing 411 (with relatively poor <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality).</b> This correlated with the finding of higher numbers of active LMW-GS genes at the A 3 and D 3 loci in Xiaoyan 54. Association analysis using recombinant inbred lines suggested that positive interactions, conferred by genetic combinations of the Glu- 3 locus alleles with more numerous active LMW-GS genes, were generally important for the recombinant progenies to attain high Zeleny sedimentation value (ZSV), an important indicator <b>of</b> <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> A higher number of active LMW-GS genes tended {{to lead to a}} more elevated ZSV, although this tendency was influenced by genetic background.

The relative and absolute areas of the peak 2 were in positive correlation with sedimentation volume (r = 0. 68; 0. 68), farinograph water absorption (r = 0. 50; 0. 57) and protein content (r = 0. 56; 0. 57).

40|$|Background and Aims Short {{periods of}} extreme {{temperature}} may affect wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seed weight, but also quality. Temporal sensitivity to extreme temperature during seed development and maturation was investigated. Methods Plants of cv.

Seed samples were harvested serially and moisture content, weight, ability to germinate, subsequent longevity in air-dry storage, and <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> determined. Key Results High temperature (34 / 20 °C) reduced final seed weight, with greatest temporal sensitivity at 7 - 14 or 14 - 21 DAA. Several aspects <b>of</b> <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> were also most sensitive to high temperature then, but whereas protein quality decreased protein and sulphur concentrations improved. Early exposure to high temperature provided earlier development of ability to germinate and tolerate desiccation, but {{had little effect on}} maximum germination capacity. All treatments at 15 / 10 °C resulted in ability to germinate declining between 58 and 65 DAA. Early exposure to high temperature hastened improvement in seed storage longevity, but the subsequent decline in late maturation preceded that in the control. Long (7 - 65 DAA) exposure to 15 / 10 °C disrupted the development of seed longevity, with no improvement after seed filling ended. Longevity improved during maturation drying in other treatments. Early (7 - 14 DAA) exposure to high reduced and low temperature increased subsequent longevity at harvest maturity, whereas late (35 - or 42 - 49 DAA) exposure to high increased and low temperature reduced it. Conclusions Temporal sensitivity to extreme temperature was detected. It varied considerably amongst the contrasting seed variables investigated. Subsequent seed longevity at harvest maturity responded negatively to temperature early in development, but positively later in development and throughout maturation...|$|R
40|$|High {{molecular}} weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) are important {{seed storage proteins}} in wheat (Triticum aestivum) that determine wheat dough elasticity and processing quality. Clarification of the defined effectiveness of HMW-GSs {{is very important to}} breeding efforts aimed at improving wheat quality. To date, there have no report on the expression silencing and quality effects of 1 Bx 20 and 1 By 20 at the Glu-B 1 locus in wheat. A wheat somatic variation line, AS 208, in which both 1 Bx 20 and 1 By 20 at Glu-B 1 locus were silenced, was developed recently in our laboratory. Evaluation of agronomic traits and seed storage proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) indicated that AS 208 was highly similar to its parental cultivar Lunxuan 987 (LX 987), with the exception that the composition and expression of HMW-GSs was altered. The 1 Bx 20 and 1 By 20 in AS 208 were further identified to be missing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Based on the PCR results for HMW-GS genes and their promoters in AS 208 compared with LX 987, 1 Bx 20 and 1 By 20 were speculated to be deleted in AS 208 during in vitro culture. Quality analysis of this line with Mixograph, Farinograph, and Extensograph instruments, as well as analysis <b>of</b> <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> traits, demonstrated that the lack of the genes encoding 1 Bx 20 and 1 By 20 caused various negative effects on dough processing and <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> traits, including falling number, dough stability time, mixing tolerance index, crude protein values, wet gluten content, bread size, and internal cell structure.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of pre-maturity α-amylase (PMA) {{is a major}} cause <b>of</b> poor <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> (low Hagberg Falling Number) in wheat grain. In susceptible genotypes, it involves the excessive accumulation of high isoelectric point (pI) α-amylase in mature grain prior to germination {{and in the absence}} of pre-harvest sprouting.

Although the factors affecting the PMA occurrence are well known, little is known about the molecular mechanism governing its induction. The plant hormones abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs) influence various aspects of grain development, and it has been suggested that PMA involves changes in the amount of these hormones or the sensitivity of the grain to these hormones.

40|$|Bread flour quality, {{which is}} {{directly}} related bread quality, varies from time to time. It is therefore almost impossible to obtain bread with consistent quality without determining the flour's suitability for bread-making {{and the addition of}} bread improvers. Rheological tests such as the farinograph and the mixograph which are commonly used by bakeries to predict flour quality are empirical in nature which makes fundamental interpretation of the results difficult. The stress relaxation test, a more fundamental rheological test, was used in combination with the mixograph to determine if the stress relaxation test can provide additional information to the mixograph on prediction of the effect of ascorbic acid and DATEM on <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> three different flour samples. In this test, an optimally developed ball of dough was compressed between parallel plates of a TA-XT 2 texture analyser. The 20 g dough was compressed to a load of 1. 5 N and thereafter allowed to relax at constant deformation. The relaxation time (RT) was recorded as time taken for the compression force to decay to a force of 0. 65 N. Longer RT indicated better flour quality. RT was compared with the mixograph peak time and peak height as predictors of the effect of ascorbic acid and DATEM on bread quality. Test bakes were carried out, and concentrations of ascorbic acid and DATEM were varied as in the stress relaxation test and the mixograph test. At the various stages of the baking process several dough and bread properties were assessed subjectively and scored according to a standardised scoring system. The mixograph was successful in characterising untreated flours in terms <b>of</b> <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> and the stress relaxation test did not provide additional information in this regard. The mixograph was better able to predict the effect of improvers on the stronger Lelie while the stress relaxation test was better at predicting improver effect (especially of DATEM) on the weaker flours, Tiger and Silver Queen. The mixograph predicted the improving effect of DATEM on Tiger and Silver Queen up to a peak, followed by no further improvement. The stress relaxation test predicted improvement beyond the peak, and this continued improvement was observed in the test bake and strong correlation (p<O. 05) was found between effect of DATEM on RTs and these important test bake parameters: baking height, loaf volume, drop baking height and the bread score. In addition to information on mixing properties provided by the mixograph, RT seemed to be predicting dough's stability, related to its gas-retaining properties. This stability which can be enhanced by DATEM may be related to both the extensibility of dough's gluten matrix and the stability of the liquid film surrounding the gluten matrix.

However, grain yields are normally low and both yields and quality can be greatly affected by the variability {{of this type of}} climate, even under irrigation. Under these conditions, grain yield increases were mainly due to {{an increase in the number}} of grains per m 2 without a reduction in the N content per spike, suggesting that N in the grain was not source-limited, possibly due to the lower grain yields and relatively high soil nitrate concentrations. In soils with lower initial soil NO- 3 N contents, better grain yields could be achieved by applying a N fertilizer rate of about 100 kg N ha- 1, whereas in soils with high initial NO- 3 N contents, no N or a maximum rate of 50 kg N ha- 1 is needed to obtain a good grain quality, showing the possibility of producing high-quality wheat with a low amount of N fertilizer and thus increasing the sustainability of the cropping system...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to define an impact of the cultivar, year and {{cultivation}} area of the standard Croatian winter wheat on the <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> The <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> cultivars ‘Divana’, ‘Žitarka’ and ‘Sana’ from the crop years 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006, and from Zagreb and Osijek location was analyzed. Wheat from the cultivar tests cultivated under the same agro technological conditions was used for this testing. The tested winter wheat <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> primarily depended on the genetic properties of cultivar. However, climatic changes occurring during the last 10 years, particularly the increase in temperatures and quantity of rainfalls in the period of the grain development, ripening and harvest, had a negative influence on the wheat breadmaking quality. Even though the average values of tested quality factors were within the expected range, a significant dependence of the cultivar Divana breadmaking quality upon the cultivation climate conditions was proven. Sana cultivar has proven to be the most stable, whereas its <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> was the lowest. For all three cultivars the <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> has been decreasing in the last 10 years, although the quality of winter wheat from the Zagreb area was higher since the climate conditions were more favourable...|$|R
40|$|Plant sucking aphids cause both {{quantitative}} and qualitative yield losses in cereals; moreover aphid-transmitted viruses are responsible for other {{quantitative and}} qualitative damages, thus direct or indirect effects of aphid infection are in focus <b>of</b> interest. <b>Bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> wheat flour is determined primarily by the protein content and composition, the gluten proteins (glutenins, gliadins) being the prime factors. Allelic composition of the gliadin- and glutenin loci {{as well as the}} absolute amount and/or the relative ratio of gliadins to glutenins are very important in dough making and in determining baking quality.  Wheat plants were caged at the beginning of stem elongation. Cages were treated with 0. 1 % methyl parathion. One week later, the caged plants were artificially infected with 5 alata individuals of Metopolophium dirhodum, Diuraphis noxia, Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi. Flour from grains originating from plants infected artificially with cereal aphids were analyzed for glutenin and gliadin and total protein content, using Size Exclusion HPLC. It was found that aphid infection had significant effect on the glutenin and gliadin content, the total protein content and the gliadin/glutenin ratio. Both the glutenin and gliadin content was significantly higher in the seeds harvested from aphid infected plants. However, the gliadin/glutenin ratio was significantly lower in wheat flour prepared from aphid infected plants than in those from uninfected control. The most significant decrease in gliadin/glutenin ratio was caused by M. dirhodum, D. noxia, S. avenae infection followed by R. padi at high-abundance and low-abundance, respectively. As the gliadin/glutenin ratio was significantly lower in flours made from aphid infected wheat seeds, it may be suggested that aphid feeding results in decreased bread making quality of wheat flour...|$|R
40|$|Identification of {{the parent}} {{combinations}} with long genetic distance and desirable HMW-GS compositions {{is one of the}} most important steps for improving <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> in bread wheat. We used RAPD and seed storage protein markers for identifying the best parent combinations of 28 Iranian wheat cultivars and advanced breeding lines for improving <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> in wheat. We considered genetic distance less than 0. 1 (< 0. 1) and quality score equal to or more than eight as criteria for selecting the best parent combinations. Six combinations out of studied cultivars including Khazar 1 /Darab 1, Azadi/Darab 1, Chenab/Darab 1, Navid/Darab 1, Star/Darab 1 and Deihim/Darab 1, were considered as suitable parents for future crosses in wheat breeding programs for breed-making quality in Iran. We suggest it should also be considered other important factors such as parents performance and complementarity for important agronomic traits in parent selection. However, integrated data of RAPD and HMW-GS compositions can make useful parent selection for breeding programs related to <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality...</b>|$|R

In this paper, we used small- and large-scale tests to analyze wheat introgression lines (ILs) derived from Triticum aestivum cv “Chinese Spring” (CS) Dasypyrum villosum (L.) Candargy (Dv) hybridization. We aimed at ascertaining the efficacy of prolamin subunits encoded by Dv genes {{for the improvement of}} wheat end-use grain quality Biochemical and genetic evidences from backcrossing those lines to CS, and the qualitative results obtained from the lines grown for two years at two localities demonstrated that the ascertained positive effects of the Dv genes on wheat-flour end-use quality correlate weakly with the size of the introgressed Dv chromatin that contained those genes or the protein content of the flour. Dv chromatin including genes at the Glu-V 1 locus, coding for high molecular weight glutenins in Dv, significantly improves wheat <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality,</b> and chromatin from the short arm of 6 V chromosome improves also protein and micronutrient (Fe and Zn) content...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted over 3 years {{to study the}} effect of applying triazole and strobilurin fungicides on the <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> Malacca winter wheat. Averaged over all years {{the application of a}} fungicide programme increased yields, particularly when strobilurin fungicides were applied. Reductions in protein concentration, sulphur concentration, Hageberg failing number and loaf volumes also occurred as the amount of fungicide applied increased. However, there were no deleterious effects of fungicide application on sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sedimentation volumes, N:S ratios or dough theology. Effects of fungicide application on <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> were not product specific. Therefore, it appears that new mechanisms to explain strobilurin effects on <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> {{do not need to be}} invoked. Where reductions in protein concentration did occur they could be compensated for by a late-season application of nitrogen either as granular ammonium nitrate at flag leaf emergence or foliar urea at anthesis. These applications, however, sometimes increased the N:S ratio of the extracted flour and failed to improve loaf volume. Multiple regression analysis revealed that main effects of year, flour protein concentration and N:S ratio could explain 93 % of the variance in loaf volume caused by season, fungicide and nitrogen treatments. However, an equally good fit was achieved by just including sulphur concentration with year. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Remarkable intervarietal differences were observed both in amount and subunit composition of these proteins. The amount of gelprotein and the SDS-sedimentation volume both {{proved to be}} good parameters for the <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> wheat cultivars. A high correlation was observed between amount of gelprotein and SDS-sedimentation volume.

40|$|Aegilops tauschii, {{the donor}} of the D genome of {{hexaploid}} wheat, is {{accepted as a}} major contributor of disease resistance and <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> attributes in cultivated wheat. High molecular weight (HMW) glutenins {{have a significant effect}} on the <b>bread-making</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> cultivated wheat. A large range of allelic variation in 424 Ae. tauschii accessions at the Glu-D 1 t locus for both x- and y-type glutenin subunits as well as at Glu-D 3 t was observed with SDS-PAGE using the total endosperm protein fraction. Only 4 accessions revealed more than 2 bands on SDS-PAGE. Seventeen new allelic combinations of both x- and y-type glutenin subunits at GluD- 1 t and 30 new allelic profiles at Glu-D 3 were detected. These combinations comprise some lines with x- or y-type null forms. RP-HPLC analysis of accession Aus 18882, which showed 5 bands when the total endosperm protein fraction was resolved on SDS-PAGE, revealed 2 x-types and 1 y-type subunit banding pattern. RP-HPLC of the gliadin fraction exhibited an omega gliadin-like subunit. SDS-PAGE processing of the gliadin-free fraction of the same accession still exhibited the gliadin-like protein. An N-terminal protein sequence of the first 7 amino acids of the slowest moving novel x- type band of accession Aus 18882 indicated its uniqueness, as no entries were found to contain this internal sequence. Demonstration of novel allelic combinations at Glu-D 1 and Glu-D 3 loci implies the potential for exploiting Ae. tauschii to increase the genetic variability of hexaploid wheat, particularly for <b>bread-making</b> <b>qualities...</b>|$|R
