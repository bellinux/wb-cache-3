40|$|Resonant {{chains are}} groups of planets for which each pair is in resonance, with an orbital period <b>ratio</b> <b>locked</b> at a {{rational}} value (2 / 1, 3 / 2, etc.). Such chains naturally form {{as a result}} of convergent migration of the planets in the proto-planetary disk. In this article, I present an analytical model of resonant chains of any number of planets. Using this model, I show that a system captured in a resonant chain can librate around several possible equilibrium configurations. The probability of capture around each equilibrium depends on how the chain formed, and especially on the order in which the planets have been captured in the chain. Therefore, for an observed resonant chain, knowing around which equilibrium the chain is librating allows for constraints to be put on the formation and migration scenario of the system. I apply this reasoning to the four planets orbiting Kepler- 223 in a 3 : 4 : 6 : 8 resonant chain. I show that the system is observed around one of the six equilibria predicted by the analytical model. Using N-body integrations, I show that the most favorable scenario to reproduce the observed configuration is to first capture the two intermediate planets, then the outermost, and finally the innermost.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} dichotomous noise added to a classical harmonic oscillator {{in the form of}} stochastic time-dependent gain and loss states, whose durations are sampled from two distinct exponential waiting time distributions. Despite the stochasticity, stability criteria can be formulated when averaging over many realizations in the asymptotic time limit and serve to determine the boundary line in parameter space that separates regions of growing amplitudes from those of decaying ones. Furthermore, the concept of PT symmetry remains applicable for such a stochastic oscillator and we use it to distinguish between an underdamped symmetric phase and an overdamped asymmetric phase. In the former case, the limit of stability is marked by the same average duration for the gain and loss states, while in the the latter case, a higher duration of the loss state is necessary to keep the system stable. The overdamped phase has an ordered structure imposing a position-velocity <b>ratio</b> <b>locking</b> and is viewed as a phase transition from the underdamped phase, which instead displays a broad and more disordered, but nevertheless, PT symmetric structure. We also address the short time limit and the dynamics of the moments of the position and the velocity with the aim of revealing the extremely rich dynamics offered by this apparently quite simple mechanical system.

40|$|New {{laminar flame}} speed {{measurements}} {{have been taken}} {{for a wide range}} of synthetic gas, or syngas, mixtures. These experiments began with two baseline mixtures. The first of these baseline mixtures was a bio-syngas surrogate with a 50 / 50 H 2 /CO split, and the second baseline mixture was a coal syngas blend with a 40 / 60 H 2 /CO split. Experiments were conducted over a range of equivalence ratios from ? = 0. 5 to 3 at initial conditions of 1 atm and 296 K. Upon completion of the baseline experiments, two different hydrocarbons were added to the fuel mixtures at levels ranging from 0. 8 to 15 % by volume, keeping the H 2 /CO <b>ratio</b> <b>locked</b> for the bio-syngas and coal syngas mixtures. The addition of these light hydrocarbons, namely CH 4 and C 2 H 6, had been shown in a previous numerical study to have significant impacts on the laminar flame speed, and the present experiments validated the suspected trends. For example, a 7 % addition of methane to the coal-syngas blend decreased the peak flame speed by about 25 % and shifted it from ? = 2. 2 to a leaner value near ? = 1. 5. Also, the addition of ethane at 1. 7 % reduced the mixture flame speed more than a similar addition of methane (1. 6 %). Images taken during the experiments show the addition of hydrocarbons increasing the stability of the flame. The analysis also looked at the effects of hydrocarbon addition on the Markstein lengths and Lewis numbers of the mixtures. Markstein lengths were relatively consistent throughout all mixtures investigated. The Lewis numbers were found to move closer to unity for both lean and rich mixtures as hydrocarbons were added. Compared to the experimental results the model predicts the shape of the flame speed curve and places the peak at the correct equivalence ratio. However the model predicts a slower flame speed when hydrocarbons are added...|$|R

In multicore/manycore systems, {{multiple}} caches increase the total power consumption and intensify latency because {{it is nearly impossible}} to hide last-level latency. Studies suggest that there are opportunities to increase the performance to power <b>ratio</b> by <b>locking</b> selected memory blocks inside the caches during runtime. However, the cache locking technique reduces the effective cache size and may introduce additional configuration difficulties, especially for multicore architectures. Furthermore, there may be other restrictions (example: PowerPC 750 GX processor does not allow cache locking at level- 1). In this paper, we propose a Smart Victim Cache (SVC) assisted caching technique that eliminates traditional cache locking without compromising the performance to power ratio. In addition to functioning as a normal victim cache, the proposed SVC holds memory blocks that may cause higher cache misses and supports stream buffering to increase cache hits. We model a Quad-Core System that has Private First Level Caches (PFLCs), a Shared Last Level Cache (SLLC), and a shared SVC located between the PFLCs and SLLC. We run simulation programs using a diverse group of applications including MPEG- 4 and H. 264 /AVC.

40|$|We {{present a}} case study of how {{topology}} can affect synchronization. Specifically, we consider arrays of phase oscillators coupled in a ring or a chain topology. Each ring is perfectly matched to a chain with the same initial conditions and the same random natural frequencies. The only difference is their boundary conditions: periodic for a ring, and open for a chain. For both topologies, stable phase-locked states exist if and only if the spread or "width" of the natural frequencies is smaller than a critical value called the locking threshold (which depends on the boundary conditions and the particular realization of the frequencies). The central question is whether a ring synchronizes more readily than a chain. We show that it usually does, but not always.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} new concept to enrich the 3 D low-order finite elements. The major application of proposed models is the numerical modeling of solid mechanics and three-dimensional structures problems. In this context, in a first part, a new family of solid finite elements, with three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom per node has been presented. This family, named SFR, is based upon SFR (Space Fiber Rotation) concept. Using the rotation of a material fiber in 3 D space, the SFR approach allows to get a more accurate displacement field, which becomes quadratic without changing the number of nodes of the linear elements. Based upon the SFR concept, eight-node brick element SFR 8 and six-node wedge element SFR 6 are proposed. In addition to that, a non-conforming version of SFR 8, named SFR 8 I, is developed to overcome the Poisson’s <b>ratio</b> <b>locking.</b> The SFR 8 I formulation includes three incompatible modes in the natural space of the element that are then eliminated by a static condensation technique. A reduced integration technique is used to integrate the SFR solid finite elements in order to avoid locking effects and to achieve an attractive, low-cost formulation. All remaining zero energy modes, resulting from the reduced integration and the equal rotation modes in both elements are efficiently controlled using special stabilization techniques. In a second part, two different modeling approaches are used for analysis of thick composite structures. A common feature in both approaches is to use the SFR concept. The first approach is to use one solid element per layer. For the second approach, the multilayered solid elements which can represent different material layers with varying fiber angles. By defining several layers with different materials and ply orientation inside one layered solid, number of elements through the thickness is remarkably reduced. These elements use two steps to calculate the full stress tensor. In the first step the in-plane stresses are computed from the material law using a displacement approximation, and then the transverse stresses are calculated from the 3 D equilibrium equation. In a third part, the application of SFR elements is extended to include geometric nonlinear problems. The formulation of the SFR elements for nonlinear problems in elasticity is presented. A total Lagrangian approach is adopted for the element formulation. The set of nonlinear equilibrium equations, obtained by appropriate energy minimization, is solved using the Newton-Raphson method. All these models are implemented in the finite element code REFLEX. To illustrate the capacities of these elements, its performances are evaluated on varied patch-tests in linear or non-linear configurations, which are used in the literature to test the finite elements of solid type. The new elements pass the patch tests for solid element and have the proper rank. Numerical results show that the SFR elements are noticeable in low sensitivity to mesh distortion and in high-accuracy of stresses. The SFR models prove to be an interesting alternative with regards to classical solid finite elements models. In order to verify the accuracy of the SFR elements for composite multilayer structures, a several problems of laminate composite are solved. The present solutions are compared with those obtained using three-dimensional elasticity theory and those available in literature. The analysis gives accurate values for displacements and stresses compared to other formulations developed by other researchers. The use of layered solid elements offers a possibility to model thick composite layups in detail with acceptable times as well as an acceptable model size...|$|R

The particulate gravity currents were initiated by releasing a fixed volume of fluid consisting of pure water mixed with silicon carbide particles from a lock {{at one end of}} the tank. The resulting motion and deposit pattern differ significantly from those for the propagation of a particulate gravity current along a flat-bottomed tank. The front of the current, seen from above, is approximately parabolic (with axis parallel to the flow direction) in contrast to the current in a flat-bottomed tank where it is nearly a straight line perpendicular to the flow. This feature mimics the results for pure saline currents. When seen in profile the currents do not have a clearly defined raised head, which is a feature of the flat-bottomed currents. The mass deposited per unit area varies nearly monotonically with respect to distance down the tank, again in contrast to the case of the flat-bottomed tank. The exceptions to this are the two experiments which have the highest <b>ratio</b> of <b>lock</b> height to length. The mass deposited per unit area across the V-shaped valley is much larger in the central part of the valley than it is on the flanks for any position along the valley.

This dissertation {{is focused on the}} design of CMOS integrated phase-locked loops (PLLs) and relevant building blocks used in multi-gigabits serial data link transceivers. Firstly, binary phase-locked loops (BPLLs, i. e., PLLs based on binary phase detectors) are modeled and analyzed. The steady-state behavior of BPLLs is derived with combined discrete-time and continuous-time analysis. The jitter performance characteristics of BPLLs are analyzed. Secondly, a 10 Gbps clock and data recovery (CDR) chip for SONET OC- 192, the mainstream standard for optical serial data links, is presented. The CDR is based on a novel referenceless dual-loop half-rate architecture. It includes a binary phase-locked loop based on a quad-level phase detector and a linear frequency-locked loop based on a linear frequency detector. The proposed architecture enables the CDR to achieve large locking range and small jitter generation at the same time. The prototype is implemented in 0. 18 ????m CMOS technology and consumes 250 mW under 1. 8 V supply. The jitter generation is 0. 5 ps-rms and 4. 8 ps-pp. The jitter peaking and jitter tolerance performance exceeds the specifications defined by SONET OC- 192 standard.

The changes in percentage of synchronization and duration of synchronized epochs before and after injection were assessed with one-way ANOVA. Sympathetic blockade with atenolol caused an increase (baseline: 0. 49 ± 0. 03 s vs. blockade: 0. 54 ± 0. 06 s) and vagal blockade with methyl-scopolamine caused a decrease (baseline: 0. 49 ± 0. 03 s vs. blockade: 0. 45 ± 0. 08 s) in the duration of synchronized epochs. Neither the overall percentage of synchronized epochs, (base-line: 10. 76 ± 3. 5 % vs. blockade 9. 44 ± 4. 3 %), nor the average <b>locking</b> <b>ratio,</b> 3 : 1, was significantly affected by autonomic blockade. In conclusion, the phase-locking between heart rhythm and respiration is modulated by both vagal and sym-pathetic efferences, in the opposite directions...|$|R
40|$|Ultra?wide band (UWB) {{system is}} a {{breakthrough}} in wireless communication, as it provides data rate one order higher than existing ones. This dissertation focuses {{on the design of}} CMOS integrated frequency synthesizer and its building blocks used in UWB system. A mixer?based frequency synthesizer architecture is proposed to satisfy the agile frequency hopping requirement, which is no more than 9. 5 ns, three orders faster than conventional phase?locked loop (PLL) ?based synthesizers. Harmonic cancela?tion technique is extended and applied to suppress the undesired harmonic mixing components. Simulation shows that sidebands at 2. 4 GHz and 5 GHz are below 36 dBc from carrier. The frequency synthesizer contains a novel quadrature VCO based on the capacitive source degeneration structure. The QVCO tackles the jeopardous ambiguity of the oscillation frequency in conventional QVCOs. Measurement shows that the 5 ?GHz CSD?QVCO in 0. 18 ?m CMOS technology draws 5. 2 mA current from a 1. 2 V power supply. Its phase noise is ? 120 dBc at 3 MHz o?set. Compared with existing phase shift LC QVCOs, the proposed CSD?QVCO presents better phase noise and power e?ciency. Finally, a novel injection locking frequency divider (ILFD) is presented. Im?plemented with three stages in 0. 18 ?m CMOS technology, the ILFD draws 3 ?mA current from a 1. 8 ?V power supply. It achieves multiple large division ratios as 6, 12, and 18 with all locking ranges greater than 1. 7 GHz and injection frequency up to 11 GHz. Compared with other published ILFDs, the proposed ILFD achieves the largest division <b>ratio</b> with satisfactory <b>locking</b> range...|$|R
40|$|Autonomic {{disturbance}} creates {{changes in}} the modulation of heart rate. In this study we analyzed the influence of sympathetic and vagal blockade on the interaction between cardiac and respiratory rhythms. In seven anaesthetized rats, electrocardiogram (ECG), and respiratory rate were recorded continuously before and after autonomic blockade with either methyl-scopolamine or atenolol. For the assessment of cardiorespiratory coordination, we analyzed the phase locking between heart rate, computed from the R-R intervals of body surface ECG, and respiratory rate, computed from impedance changes, using Hilbert transform. The procedure was carried out for different m:n coordination ratios where, m, {{is the number of}} heart beats and n, is the number of respiratory cycles. The changes in percentage of synchronization and duration of synchronized epochs before and after injection were assessed with one-way ANOVA. Sympathetic blockade with atenolol caused an increase (baseline: 0. 49 } 0. 03 s vs. blockade: 0. 54 } 0. 06 s) and vagal blockade with methylscopolamine caused a decrease (baseline: 0. 49 } 0. 03 s vs. blockade: 0. 45 } 0. 08 s) in the duration of synchronized epochs. Neither the overall percentage of synchronized epochs, (baseline: 10. 76 } 3. 5 % vs. blockade 9. 44 } 4. 3 %), nor the average <b>locking</b> <b>ratio,</b> 3 : 1, was significantly affected by autonomic blockade.
