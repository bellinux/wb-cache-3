5|$|Seven minutes later, {{two other}} high-calibre shells struck the Bretagne {{at the same}} time. The first detonated {{at the base of}} the tripod mast, igniting some <b>ready-to-use</b> {{anti-aircraft}} projectiles which were stored in lockers next to the anti-aircraft mounts. The second went through the central 138 mm casement, exploding deep inside the ship. A fire started, with leaking oil burning next to the ship. In about thirty seconds, the ship rolled and exploded.|$|E

25|$|The term Erlang is used interchangeably with Erlang/OTP, or OTP, which {{consists}} of the Erlang runtime system, a number of <b>ready-to-use</b> components mainly written in Erlang, {{and a set of}} design principles for Erlang programs.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by {{a speech}} by {{antiseptic}} advocate Joseph Lister, Robert Wood Johnson joined his brothers James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson to create a line of <b>ready-to-use</b> surgical dressings in 1885. The company produced its first products in 1886 and incorporated in 1887.|$|E
25|$|Technopark has support {{facilities}} such as {{a satellite}} earth station, a 200-seater convention centre, a club and guest house, a shopping complex (Techno-Mall), banks, ATMs, restaurants and conference rooms on campus. Furthermore, setting up of new units is accelerated by exemption from State level clearances {{as well as through}} <b>ready-to-use</b> incubation facilities.|$|E
25|$|Evstafi {{was struck}} five {{times during the}} engagement, {{suffering}} 34 killed and 24 wounded. Yavuz had only been struck once, but lost 13 crew (12 Germans and one Turk). As {{a result of the}} ammunition detonation by the battlecruiser's 5.9-inch gun, the Ottomans decided to decrease the amount of <b>ready-to-use</b> shells and cartridges in the casemates.|$|E
25|$|Specially {{formulated}} foods do however appear {{useful in}} {{those from the}} developing world with moderate acute malnutrition. In young children with severe acute malnutrition it is unclear if <b>ready-to-use</b> therapeutic food differs from a normal diet. They may have some benefits in humanitarian emergencies {{as they can be}} eaten directly from the packet, do not require refrigeration or mixing with clean water, and can be stored for years.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{toxicity}} is dose-related; skin {{exposure to}} <b>ready-to-use</b> glyphosate formulations can cause irritation, and photocontact dermatitis has been occasionally reported. These effects are {{probably due to}} the preservative benzisothiazolin-3-one. Severe skin burns are very rare. Inhalation is a minor route of exposure, but spray mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, or tingling and irritation in the throat. Eye exposure may lead to mild conjunctivitis. Superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation is delayed or inadequate.|$|E
25|$|AnyLogic {{allows users}} to import CAD {{drawings}} as DXF files, and then visualize models on top of them. This feature {{can be used for}} animating processes inside objects like factories, warehouses, hospitals, etc. This functionality is mostly used in Discrete Event (process-based) models in manufacturing, healthcare, civil engineering, and construction. AnyLogic software also supports 3D animation and includes a collection of <b>ready-to-use</b> 3D objects for animation related to different industries, including buildings, road, rail, maritime, transport, energy, warehouse, hospital, equipment, airport-related items, supermarket-related items, cranes, and other objects.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of methylene blue after {{the reaction of}} hydrogen sulfide with dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and iron(III) at pH0.4–0.7 is used to determine by photometric measurements sulfide concentration in the range 0.020 to 1.50mg/L (20ppb to 1.5ppm). The test is very sensitive and the blue coloration developing upon contact of the reagents with dissolved H2S is stable for 60min. <b>Ready-to-use</b> kits such as the Spectroquant sulfide test facilitate routine analyses. The methylene blue sulfide test is a convenient method often used in soil microbiology to quickly detect in water the metabolic activity of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). It should be observed that in this test, methylene blue {{is a product of}} reaction and not a reagent.|$|E
25|$|The 2A70 rifled gun {{is capable}} of firing guided and unguided shells. 34 <b>ready-to-use</b> unguided HE-Frag shells are carried in the turret of the vehicle. The 100mm gun is fitted with an {{autoloader}} that fires {{at a rate of}} 10-12 rounds per minute, with the time of each shell loading being 5–6 seconds. The two variants of HE-Frag shells available for the Bakhcha-U are the 3UOF17 and 3UOF19; the former having a muzzle velocity of 250m/s with the latter achieving 355m/s. The 3UOF19 also provides a substantially larger proximity detonation which increases the lethal radius of the explosion. When implemented in the Bakhcha-U turret, the range of the 2A70 is increased to 7km with its unguided rounds.|$|E
25|$|On {{the shield}} version, the AATTV unit {{name on the}} boomerang was in block higher case text and the motto on the scroll was in heraldic higher case. On unit correspondence, all text was {{displayed}} in block higher case. As the boomerang is a <b>ready-to-use</b> weapon, the crossbow was presented loaded so that both symbolised the AATTV and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam as being ready for action. Each item on the badge, each colour, each item of text and {{the shape of the}} shield, in combination, are symbolic of Australia's military traditions, the individual Australian soldier's reputation in combat and, in particular, the AATTV's record of valour. Ironically the crossbow was not a symbol of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, but a weapon used by the Montagnard and banned by President Ngo Dinh Diem in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to improve}} {{nutrition}} {{are some of}} the most effective forms of development aid. Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children, and efforts to promote the practice increase the rates of breastfeeding. In young children, providing food (in addition to breastmilk) between six months and two years of age improves outcomes. There is also good evidence supporting the supplementation of a number of micronutrients to women during pregnancy and among young children in the developing world. To get food to people who need it most, both delivering food and providing money so people can buy food within local markets are effective. Simply feeding students at school is insufficient. Management of severe malnutrition within the person's home with <b>ready-to-use</b> therapeutic foods is possible much of the time. In those who have severe malnutrition complicated by other health problems, treatment in a hospital setting is recommended. This often involves managing low blood sugar and body temperature, addressing dehydration, and gradual feeding. Routine antibiotics are usually recommended due to the high risk of infection. Longer-term measures include: improving agricultural practices, reducing poverty, improving sanitation, and the empowerment of women.|$|E
25|$|Anti-tank guided weapons (ATGMs) can be {{operated}} by the BMD-3. This is {{made possible by the}} 9P135M launcher post that fires the wire guided Fagot (NATO reporting name: AT-4 Spigot) and Konkurs (NATO reporting name: AT-5 Spandrel) missiles. The 9P135M launcher is located on the top center of the BMD-3 turret and is dismountable. The crew can engage targets from the vehicle or a distance away from the system. The ATGM launcher has three <b>ready-to-use</b> rounds and two stowed in the vehicle. The Fagot missile is a short range ATGM with an effective range of 2km. While flying at an average speed of 186m/s, it penetrates 480mm of RHA. The Fagot-M is an improved variant that has an increased effective range of 2.5km and a penetration of 550mm of RHA. The Konkurs missile has an effective range of 4000 m and flies at an average speed of 206m/s. The original Konkurs missile penetrates 750–800mm of RHA while the improved Konkurs-M penetrates 750–800mm of RHA after ERA due to an additional tandem warhead. The firing range is reduced to 2500 m during night time. A French-German Flame-V adapter kit allows the BMD-3 to launch MILAN ATGMs.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{has been}} positive. The award-winning director Teguh Karya cited {{the works of}} Djajakusuma, Usmar Ismail, and Asrul Sani as [...] "legendary" [...] and among his greatest influences. Choreographer Bagong Kussudiardjo reportedly so respected Djajakusuma that he had named his son Djadoeg after the director. According to a memorial in the newspaper Kompas, Djajakusuma was also dubbed a [...] "living legend" [...] {{during his visit to}} Nantes. A later Kompas article records Djajakusuma's best-remembered works are Harimau Tjampa and Tjambuk Api. Those two works are those most often shown, owing to the fact that <b>ready-to-use</b> copies are stored at Sinematek Indonesia; his other surviving films are kept as negatives.|$|E
500|$|On {{either side}} of the terreplein, wide of the 64-pound guns, are two small rooms known as the expense stores. They were used for <b>ready-to-use</b> {{ammunition}} for the adjacent guns, except for armour piercing shells which were stored in the rear-defence wall's archways. Between the 64-pounders and the 10" [...] gun positions are two raised observation platforms set into the structure for gun commanders to spot the fall of outgoing shells. Ranging was either performed from here or from a ranging position set in the sand hills to the fort's north. Between the 10" [...] guns is a T-shaped loading gallery that draws shells and gunpowder via a hoist system from the magazine below. Either side of the gallery was installed the Armstrong mechanical loading systems for the 10" [...] guns. These mechanical systems proved unsuccessful and were removed in the 1890s, though the southern one has been reconstructed. The magazine is accessed from the manning parade and is directly beneath the 10" [...] gun loading gallery. Voice pipes and hoists originally installed have been removed but their remains are visible.|$|E

2500|$|Pods and pod packs: The {{most common}} {{addition}} to the above [...] "mandatory" [...] equipment, pods are plastic containers, usually with flip-open lids, that store paintballs in a <b>ready-to-use</b> manner. Pods are available in many sizes, including 10, 80, 100 and 140-round sizes, with the larger 140-round pods being most common among tournament players. Pods are carried by the player in pod packs or harnesses which facilitate {{easy access to the}} pods during play. There are several designs of pod packs, from belt loops allowing a recreational player to carry one or two extra pods, to harness designs generally designed for either tournament-style or scenario-style players.|$|E

2500|$|Currently, eight {{volumes of}} poems {{stand out in}} Leitner's larger {{contribution}} to the art form, which also includes over 30 poetry anthologies, {{as well as more}} than 20 issues of the magazine DAS GEDICHT. His poems have also been featured in magazines, newspapers, television and radio broadcasts (e.g. Brigitte, mare, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Die Zeit, Bayerischer Rundfunk, etc.). Many of his poems have been included in anthologies, focusing on contemporary poetry in German. Leitner's poetic work has always stood in critical relation to his editorial work, which not only informs and influences his work as an author, but also places his own poetry in a unique situation in terms of aesthetic production, as various commentators have noted. While attempting to locate Anton G. Leitner's persona within the literary landscape of contemporary poetry in 1986, Manfred Lange wrote: [...] "He's hard to classify, and that makes him likeable. He doesn't give you <b>ready-to-use</b> worldviews, but thoughts, perspectives, and a strong plea for new departures." ...|$|E
2500|$|In China, {{some species}} of {{jellyfish}} in the Rhizostomae order caught in coastal {{areas have been}} utilized {{as a source of}} food and ingredient in Chinese cuisine for over 1,700 years. Cannonball jellyfish (Stomolophus meleagris) and jelly blubber (Catostylus mosaicus) are edible species of jellyfish. Of note is that when live, the cannonball jellyfish contains toxins that can cause cardiac problems in animals (including humans). Rhopilema esculentum and Rhopilema hispidium are edible jellyfish, and are the most common ones consumed in China, Japan and Korea. Additional edible jellyfish species include Aurelia aurita, C. orsini, Dactylometra pacifica, Hispidium spp., Lobonema smithi, Lobonemoides gracilis and Nomura's jellyfish (Stomolophus nomuria). Desalted <b>ready-to-use</b> jellyfish are low in calories and contain hardly any fat, about 5% protein and 95% water. They do not have much flavor, and may be used to add additional texture and mouthfeel to various dishes. In some areas of Asia, jellyfish is [...] "associated with easing bone and muscle pain." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Dr. Aaron T. Dossey {{announced}} that his company, All Things Bugs, {{had been named}} a Grand Challenges Explorations winner by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Grand Challenges Explorations provides funding to individuals with ideas for new approaches to public health and development. The research project is titled [...] "Good Bugs: Sustainable Food for Malnutrition in Children". Director of pediatric nutrition at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Frank Franklin has argued that since low calories and low protein are the {{main causes of death}} for approximately 5 million children annually, insect protein formulated into a <b>ready-to-use</b> therapeutic food similar to Nutriset's Plumpy'Nut could have potential as a relatively inexpensive solution to malnutrition. In 2009, Dr. Vercruysse from Ghent University in Belgium has proposed that insect protein can be used to generate hydrolysates, exerting both ACE inhibitory and antioxidant activity, which might be incorporated as multifunctional ingredient into functional foods. Additionally, edible insects can provide a good source of unsaturated fats, thereby helping to reduce coronary disease.|$|E
