5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the <b>rear</b> <b>surface</b> of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E
25|$|A {{protective}} overcoat {{is usually}} applied before the mirror {{is removed from}} the vacuum, because the coating otherwise begins to corrode as soon as it is exposed to oxygen and humidity in the air. Front silvered mirrors have to be resurfaced occasionally to keep their quality. There are optical mirrors such as mangin mirrors that are second surface mirrors (reflective coating on the <b>rear</b> <b>surface)</b> as part of their optical designs, usually to correct optical aberrations.|$|E
25|$|E. imperialis can be {{identified}} from other bees by its relatively large size and relatively sparse hairs, which expose their brightly metallic color. Males have conspicuous white marks around the mouth, whereas similar markings are diminutive in females. Males also have a broad hind tibia, rhomboid or triangular in shape and rounded distally, used as a storage organ for aromatic materials. Male forelegs have five tarsal segments, which have dense tufts of hairs (or ‘brushes’) on the ventral surface, that are useful for picking up oily liquids by capillarity. An elongated pit covered by long hairs (a ‘scar’) {{can also be seen}} on the outer <b>rear</b> <b>surface</b> of the tibia, which shows two lobes, each of which has an opening into the tibial organ. The wall of the tibial organ is extremely wrinkled, on which the inner surface has many large branched hairs. Males also display a characteristic pattern of short, dense hairs on the outer surface of the mid tibia, with one or two small hairy patches within a much larger patch. All E. imperialis are known to have relatively long tongues in comparison to other bee species. They also have two widely separated tufts of hair without any obvious tubes or slits on the second (metasomal) sternum.|$|E

50|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry-Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially reflective glass optical flats spaced micrometers to centimeters apart, with the reflective surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry-Pérot etalon uses a single plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) The flats in an interferometer are often made in a wedge shape to prevent the <b>rear</b> <b>surfaces</b> from producing interference fringes; the <b>rear</b> <b>surfaces</b> often also have an anti-reflective coating.|$|R

500|$|The {{teeth of}} Tyrannosaurus rex {{displayed}} marked heterodonty (differences in shape). The premaxillary teeth {{at the front}} of the upper jaw were closely packed, D-shaped in cross-section, had reinforcing ridges on the <b>rear</b> <b>surface,</b> were incisiform (their tips were chisel-like blades) and curved backwards. The D-shaped cross-section, reinforcing ridges and backwards curve reduced the risk that the teeth would snap when Tyrannosaurus bit and pulled. The remaining teeth were robust, like [...] "lethal bananas" [...] rather than daggers, more widely spaced and also had reinforcing ridges. Those in the upper jaw were larger than those in all but the rear of the lower jaw. The largest found so far is estimated to have been [...] long including the root when the animal was alive, making it the largest tooth of any carnivorous dinosaur yet found.|$|E
2500|$|The kidney is a bean-shaped {{structure}} with a [...] and a [...] border. A recessed {{area on the}} concave border is the renal hilum, where the renal artery enters the kidney and the renal vein and ureter leave. The kidney is surrounded by tough fibrous tissue, the renal capsule, which is itself surrounded by perirenal fat, renal fascia, and pararenal fat. The anterior (front) surface of these tissues is the peritoneum, while the posterior (<b>rear)</b> <b>surface</b> is the transversalis fascia.|$|E

50|$|This flabellinid nudibranch has a {{translucent}} {{body with a}} line of opaque white pigment {{at the edge of}} the foot. The outer half of the rhinophores and oral tentacles are covered with white pigment. The rhinophores are tuberculate on their <b>rear</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The animal grows to 10 mm in length. A variant with lines of white pigment on the oral tentacles and <b>rear</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the rhinophores is known from northern New Zealand.|$|R
2500|$|On an aircraft, {{the rudder}} is a {{directional}} control surface {{along with the}} rudder-like elevator (usually attached to horizontal tail structure, if not a slab elevator [...] ) and ailerons (attached to the wings) that control pitch and roll, respectively. [...] The rudder is usually attached to the fin (or vertical stabilizer) which allows the pilot to control yaw about the vertical axis, i.e. change the horizontal direction in which the nose is pointing. [...] The rudder's direction in aircraft since the [...] "Golden Age" [...] of flight between the two World Wars into the 21st century has been manipulated with the movement {{of a pair of}} counter-moving foot pedals by the pilot, while during the pre-1919 era rudder control was most often operated with by a center-pivoted, solid [...] "rudder bar" [...] which usually had pedal and/or stirrup-like hardware on its ends to allow the pilot's feet to stay close {{to the ends of the}} bar's <b>rear</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{structural}} fuselage of the Types M and N was {{a rectangular}} section, ash framed lattice girder with wire cross bracing. Poplar formers and stringers produced a more rounded, fabric covered section. The pilot sat well {{down in an}} open cockpit over the wing and behind the upper pylon. A wide range of engines were fitted, including the [...] Anzani three cylinder inverted Y radial engine, the [...] Anzani 6-cylinder two row radial and the [...] Gnome. The last, a rotary engine, was usually covered over the upper part to screen the pilot from oil spray; the Anzanis were mounted uncowled. They all drove large, rather broad chord propellers. [...] The very broad chord, low aspect ratio tailplane was constructed like the wing with a flexible <b>rear</b> <b>surface</b> acting both to improve stability and, by warping, act like conventional elevators, its trailing edge extending well beyond {{the end of the}} fuselage. [...] A small, near rectangular, one piece, rigid fin was pivoted near its leading edge from the extreme tail.|$|E
2500|$|The compact SG 552 Commando (full {{designation}} as the 552-2P) carbine {{was released}} in July 1998. It has a shorter [...] barrel (with an open, 3-prong flash suppressor) and gas tube, ventilated handguards and a redesigned bolt carrier group that was integrated with the piston rod to form a single moving assembly. The SG 552 series rifles have a [...] long sight radius. The return mechanism has been moved {{to the rear of}} the receiver housing and its recoil spring is guided in a way analogous to that of the AK-47: on a steel guide rod (later models feature a polymer guide rod) resting against the lower receiver's <b>rear</b> <b>surface</b> under tension of the compressed recoil spring. Like the SG 550/551, this model can accept rails and accessories enabling the use of optics. A long barrel version of the SG 552 known as the SG 552 LB incorporates a [...] barrel with provision to fire rifle grenades and support a bayonet. The SG 552 models were discontinued in 2008 and replaced by the SG 553. Upgrade part kits are available to convert a SG 552 in to a SG 553.|$|E

2500|$|The RASCAL design {{used the}} X-9's canard {{aerodynamic}} configuration and a rocket engine {{derived from the}} X-9's rocket-propulsion system. The RASCAL was larger than the X-9 with a fuselage that was [...] longer and [...] larger in diameter. The RASCAL's flight controls included forward and <b>rear</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Forward surfaces include fixed horizontal stabilizers and movable dorsal and ventral <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>surfaces</b> include wings with ailerons and fixed dorsal and ventral stabilizers. The aft lower stabilizer could be folded for ground handling.|$|R

2500|$|The JetStar has {{a fairly}} typical {{business}} jet design layout, with a swept wing and a cruciform tail. The wing has a 30° sweepback and features large fuel tanks at about half-span, extending some distance {{in front and}} behind the wing. [...] The wings hold 10,000 pounds of fuel, and each slipper tank holds 4,000 pounds of fuel for a total fuel load of 18,000 pounds. [...] The wing also includes leading edge flaps (not slats) along {{the front of the}} wing outboard of the tanks (these leading edge flaps reduce the stalling speed by an additional three knots), while double-slotted trailing edge flaps span the entire <b>rear</b> <b>surface</b> inboard of the ailerons. [...] The wing incorporates inflatable rubber deicing boots for the removal of accumulated inflight ice. The horizontal stabilizer is mounted nearly halfway up the fin to keep it clear of the engines' jet blast. One feature is that the horizontal stabilizer is trimmable by pivoting the entire tail fin and stabilizer assembly, which has a distinctive unpainted area {{at the base of the}} fin that is noticeable in most pictures. The JetStar does not have any tail deicing capability, nor was it required for certification. [...] A speed brake is located on the underside of the fuselage to aid deceleration for landing. The original prototypes used a tricycle landing gear with one wheel per leg, but after an accident in 1962 the nose gear was modified with two tires.|$|E
50|$|In many respects, {{including}} long tertial feathers, larks resemble other ground birds such as pipits. However, in larks the tarsus (the lowest leg bone, {{connected to}} the toes) has only one set of scales on the <b>rear</b> <b>surface,</b> which is rounded. Pipits and all other songbirds have two plates of scales on the <b>rear</b> <b>surface,</b> which meet at a protruding rear edge (Ridgway 1907).|$|E

50|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the Senior were large, with a rectangular, strut-braced {{tailplane}} {{mounted on}} top of the fuselage carrying elevators hinged at the end of it. Its wire-braced, tall, broad, rounded fin had a straight-edged unbalanced rudder which, like the elevators, overhung the extreme tail.|$|R
50|$|The wing itself {{took the}} form of a flat ring or annulus, curved to form an {{aerofoil}} shape in section and with upward dihedral raising it progressively towards the tips.
