25|$|Octadecyl <b>Rhodamine</b> B Self-Quenching: This assay {{is based}} on self-quenching of octadecyl <b>rhodamine</b> B. Octadecyl <b>rhodamine</b> B self-quenching occurs when the probe is {{incorporated}} into membrane lipids at concentrations of 1-10 mole percent because <b>Rhodamine</b> dimers quench fluorescence. In this method, membrane labeled <b>Rhodamine</b> combines with unlabeled membrane. Fusion with unlabeled membranes resulting in dilution of the probe, which is accompanied by increasing fluorescence. The major problem of this assay is spontaneous transfer.|$|E
25|$|Other popular tracer dyes are <b>rhodamine,</b> pyranine and sulforhodamine.|$|E
25|$|NBD-Rhodamine Energy Transfer: In this method, {{membrane}} {{labeled with}} both NBD (donor) and <b>Rhodamine</b> (acceptor) combine with unlabeled membrane. When NBD and <b>Rhodamine</b> are {{within a certain}} distance, the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) happens. After fusion, resonance energy transfer (FRET) decreases when the average distance between probes increases, while NBD fluorescence increases.|$|E
25|$|This {{method is}} of {{critical}} importance in the modern life sciences, {{as it can be}} extremely sensitive, allowing the detection of single molecules. Many different fluorescent dyes can be used to stain different structures or chemical compounds. One particularly powerful method is the combination of antibodies coupled to a fluorophore as in immunostaining. Examples of commonly used fluorophores are fluorescein or <b>rhodamine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Efflux transporter-expressing cells {{actively}} pump substrates {{out of the}} cell, {{which results}} in a lower rate of substrate accumulation, lower intracellular concentration at steady state, or a faster rate of substrate elimination from cells loaded with the substrate. Transported radioactive substrates or labeled fluorescent dyes can be directly measured, or in an indirect set up, the modulation of the accumulation of a probe substrate (e.g. fluorescent dyes like <b>rhodamine</b> 123, or calcein) can be determined {{in the presence of}} a test drug.|$|E
25|$|It {{can be used}} as an {{artificial}} biomarker in wildlife to check if wild animals are consuming a bait that contains a vaccine or medication. Since it is fluorescent and binds to calcium, a UV lamp can be used to check if it is in a tooth pulled from an animal. For example, it was used to check uptake of oral rabies vaccine baits by raccoons in the USA. However, this is an invasive procedure for the animal and labour-intensive for the researcher. Therefore, other dyes such as <b>Rhodamine</b> B that can be detected in hair and whiskers are preferred.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} in the industrial applications section above, lanthanide metals are particularly useful in technologies that {{take advantage of their}} reactivity to specific wavelengths of light. Certain life science applications take advantage of the unique luminescence properties of lanthanide ion complexes (Ln(III) chelates or cryptates). These are well-suited for this application due to their large Stokes shifts and extremely long emission lifetimes (from microseconds to milliseconds) compared to more traditional fluorophores (e.g., fluorescein, allophycocyanin, phycoerythrin, and <b>rhodamine).</b> The biological fluids or serum commonly used in these research applications contain many compounds and proteins which are naturally fluorescent. Therefore, the use of conventional, steady-state fluorescence measurement presents serious limitations in assay sensitivity. Long-lived fluorophores, such as lanthanides, combined with time-resolved detection (a delay between excitation and emission detection) minimizes prompt fluorescence interference.|$|E

2500|$|A {{transparent}} dielectric sphere, such as {{a liquid}} droplet, also forms an interesting optical cavity. In 1986 Richard K. Chang et al. demonstrated lasing using [...] ethanol microdroplets (20–40 micrometers in radius) doped with <b>rhodamine</b> 6G dye. This type of optical cavity exhibits optical resonances when {{the size of the}} sphere or the optical wavelength or the refractive index is varied. The resonance is known as morphology-dependent resonance.|$|E
2500|$|The autocorrelations above {{assume that}} the {{fluctuations}} are not due {{to changes in the}} fluorescent properties of the particles. [...] However, for the majority of (bio)organic fluorophores—e.g. green fluorescent protein, <b>rhodamine,</b> Cy3 and Alexa Fluor dyes—some fraction of illuminated particles are excited to a triplet state (or other non-radiative decaying states) and then do not emit photons for a characteristic relaxation time [...] [...] Typically [...] is on the order of microseconds, which is usually smaller than the dynamics of interest (e.g. [...] ) but large enough to be measured. [...] A multiplicative term is added to the autocorrelation to account for the triplet state. [...] For normal diffusion: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequencing}} of actin {{was completed by}} M. Elzinga and co-workers in 1973. The crystal structure of G-actin was solved in 1990 by Kabsch and colleagues. [...] In the same year, a model for F-actin was proposed by Holmes and colleagues following experiments using co-crystallization with different proteins. The procedure of co-crystallization with different proteins was used repeatedly during the following years, until in 2001 the isolated protein was crystallized along with ADP. However, {{there is still no}} high-resolution X-ray structure of F-actin. The crystallization of F-actin was possible due to the use of a <b>rhodamine</b> conjugate that impedes polymerization by blocking the amino acid cys-374. Christine Oriol-Audit died in the same year that actin was first crystallized but she was the researcher that in 1977 first crystallized actin in the absence of Actin Binding Proteins (ABPs). However, the resulting crystals were too small for the available technology of the time.|$|E

Although highly soluble, this formulation is very corrosive to all metals except stainless steel. Other formulations are less soluble, but also less corrosive. <b>Rhodamine</b> 6G perchlorate (C27H29ClN2O7) {{comes in the form}} of red crystals, while <b>rhodamine</b> 6G tetrafluoroborate (C27H29BF4N2O3) appears as maroon crystals.|$|E

TRITC is the base <b>rhodamine</b> molecule functionalized with an isothiocyanate group (-N=C=S), replacing a hydrogen atom {{on the bottom}} ring of the structure.
