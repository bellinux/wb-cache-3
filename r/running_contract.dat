30|$|Only a small {{share of}} German {{households}} {{make use of}} the opportunity to regularly switch their electricity supplier in order to fulfill their needs. Besides the relatively low possible monetary savings, another reason is the fact of long <b>running</b> <b>contracts.</b> The process of supplier switching for stakeholders in the energy market is quite time-consuming. This is caused by inefficient design of the process steps {{due to a lack of}} automation, of common data management and of direct communication between these stakeholders.|$|R
50|$|Manucharyan scored {{his first}} goal for Ajax in an 18-0 {{pre-season}} win over a Dutch amateur side. Manucharyan made his Ajax and his Eredivisie debut on 18 September 2005 in a 4-2 defeat to AZ Alkmaar {{coming off the}} bench in the 84th minute in place of striker Ryan Babel In the 2005-06 season, he played {{a total of four}} matches in the championship and won the KNVB Cup. He also participated in the Amsterdam Tournament of 2006 coming on as a substitute against Inter Milan and featuring in the starting line-up against Manchester United. After the match, both Olympique Lyonnais and S.L. Benfica showed interest in the player. However, on 16 March 2007 his <b>running</b> <b>contract</b> until 2008 was extended until 30 June 2011.|$|E
5000|$|When Al-Ahly {{announced}} that their satellite channel {{will have the}} exclusive satellite rights of airing the team's domestic games {{but they will be}} broadcast terrestrially as usual the problem began. After that EFA have earlier announced their rejection of Al-Ahly's proposal that club's channel and ESC would be the only satellite broadcaster due to the Association's <b>running</b> <b>contract</b> with other satellite networks to air all league games. After that Al-Ahly president Hassan Hamdy confirmed that the club is still keen on maintaining their rights of exclusive satellite broadcasting to the club's league football games. On October, 2008 A Bahraini corporation has made a bid of EGP 200 million to acquire the Egyptian League broadcasting exclusive rights, The company is also interested in televising and promoting the Egyptian cup games as well as Egypt's international matches, It is worth noting that the EFA's current EGP 18-million deal with several satellite channels will run out {{by the end of the}} ongoing season. After that several TV networks have decided to sue the Egyptian FA (EFA) and the public Radio and TV Union (ERTU) after being prevented from broadcasting a league game for Ahly. Zamalek chairman Mohamed Amer said his club might follow in the footsteps of arch-rivals Al-Ahly in demanding the exclusive rights to broadcast their home league games. January, 2009 Egyptian Football Association (EFA) president Samir Zaher said that the league games' broadcasting row will be resolved before the upcoming Cairo derby. On April, 2009 the Egyptian FA reached an agreement with IMG Media Company to sell the rights of broadcasting the Premier League next season, The company made an amazing offer, guaranteeing at least a EGP 140million revenue. They will also cost us nothing if they failed to reach that target. Before the Egyptian Super Cup, Egyptian FA president Samir Zaher said the local Super Cup between Al-Ahly and Haras El Hodood, which is scheduled for 21 July, would not be televised as the row over broadcasting rights intensified, TV viewers will not be able to watch the season curtain-raiser after a seven-member committee failed to reach an agreement with the Egyptian Radio and Television Union (ERTU) over airing domestic games for next season, As the committee, which includes several clubs like Cairo duo Al-Ahly and El Zamalek in addition to the FA, did not accept the Egyptian Radio and Television Union (ERTU)'s offer to broadcast league and cup matches for EGP90 million. After 4 days the ERTU has acquired the broadcasting rights of the Super Cup match between Al-Ahly and Haras El Hodood for EGP1.25 million, The first week of the Egyptian premier league have not been broadcasting on the cable channels but only on the state TV channels. On 19 August 2009 (the second week of the league) Egyptian premier league clubs did not allow the state TV to air Wednesday's Egyptian Premier League matches after both parties failed to reach an agreement over the ongoing broadcasting saga, Only the first-half of Haras El Hodood and El Geish match was broadcast while usual TV viewers had to listen to radio to follow game between title holders Al-Ahly and Ittihad El-Shorta. Zamalek will follow in the footsteps of those teams after deciding not to broadcast Thursday's match against Petrojet as Zamalek's spokesman Sabri Serag said on the club's official website. [...] Finally after nearly two years and half the Egyptian Premier League broadcasting saga had been resolved, on Thursday 20 August 2009 this means that Thursday's league games will be broadcast live. Local Channel 2 and the Egyptian Satellite Channel are entitled to broadcast games for free, while private cable networks will be charged EGP 8million each per season.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Contract {{services}} let {{service providers}} and consumers manage {{service level agreements}} (SLAs) and other contractual documents. These services let users negotiate SLAs, select tariffs, submit selected service offerings to auctions, view and manage <b>running</b> <b>contracts</b> and finally submit feedback about the satisfaction with the usage of contract-bound services. We define a number of contract services specifically for consumers which run as platform-level services with a common associated user interface called Contract Wizard. The increased interactivity over purely autonomous approaches is crucial for a wider acceptance of contract-bound service execution. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient {{strategy for the}} optimal network redesign with a biconnectivity-oriented topology (both edge and vertex biconnected). It helps re-designing existing networks or generating new networks consider-ing practically relevant constraints (such as leased lines with long <b>running</b> <b>contracts</b> to remain, maximum number of ports per device) typically found in these phases. The proposed strategy is composed of Reduction, Augmentation, and Fine-Tuning Reduction. Empirical tests using several IP network topologies showed the robustness and applica-bility of the method. Its application to other optical back-bone (or access) network redesign problems is possible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} locally monitoring contract regulated behaviours in agentbased web services. We encode contract clauses in service specifications by using extended timed automata. We propose a non intrusive local monitoring framework along with an API to monitor the fulfillment (or violation) of contractual obligations. A key feature of the framework {{is that it is}} fully symbolic thereby providing a scalable solution to monitoring. At runtime execution steps generated by the service are passed as input to the runtime monitor. Conformance of the execution against the service specification is checked using a symbolically represented extended timed automaton. This allows us to monitor service behaviours over large state spaces generated by multiple, long <b>running</b> <b>contracts.</b> We illustrate our methodology by monitoring a service composition scenario from the vehicle repair domain, and report on the experimental results. 1...|$|R
