Polish historian Stanisław Salmonowicz, discussing the historiography of the Polish Underground State, defined it as a [...] "collection of state-legal, organizational and citizenship structures, which were to ensure constitutional continuation of Polish statehood on its own territory".

His performances and dancing technique have often marked comparisons to his influences Michael Jackson and James Brown. He told People Magazine in 2008 that [...] "James Brown introduced me to soul. Because of him I was given a clear view of what a <b>real</b> <b>performance</b> is and should be. I learned showmanship from him." [...] On his 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, Larry Nager of The Cincinnati Enquirer hailed Usher's simultaneous ability, stating [...] "the 23-year-old Atlantan proved you can sing and dance at the same time. Of course, that's how James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Usher's most obvious role model Michael Jackson did it, but in today's high-tech, gimmicky concerts, it's a lost art", and claims his show [...] "ended the reign of 'Nsync, Britney {{and the rest of the}} lip-synching, teen-pop acts". Usher performed singles [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Yeah!" [...] at 2004 MTV Video Music Awards under a rain machine, in which he eventually threw the mic stand at a mirror during the former. Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 of their [...] "20 Best MTV VMAs Opening Performances". Chad Batka for The New York Times said [...] "He has established himself as one of R's supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular: songs that alternate between choppy and smooth, vocals punctuated by exultant high whoops, a dance vocabulary." [...] Capable of playing the piano, Usher also began to adopt playing on other instruments such as the drums and the bass guitar, amid singles [...] "Good Kisser" [...] and [...] "She Came to Give It to You" [...] in 2014. The UR Experience Tour was reported to have consisted of a nine-piece band and three backing vocalists according to Billboard, in which The Guardian called him [...] "a masterful all-rounder who surrounds himself with talent on stage". Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone labels him the [...] "Award Show King", explaining [...] "His dedication to choreography dates back to the days when Janet Jackson made videos that looked like they were shot in one take. He's an entertainer that would have been stunning at any point in the last 60 years of television." ...|$|E

Although it is already requested by operators of mobile networks only basic approaches have been realized.

Based on these analyses a policy based performance management system is introduced that allows a balanced configuration which does not exceed available resources but still satisfies the information requirements of the human operators. ...|$|R

Karaoke machines were initially placed in restaurants and hotel rooms; soon, new businesses called karaoke boxes, with compartmented rooms, became popular.

The patented use of tiled memory used by the GD546x chips is still used by nearly all graphics processors today. However, like many other 2D/3D chips at the time were gate limited by the process technology available at the time, the feature set of perspective-correct texture mapping, bilinear filtering, single-pass lighting, gouraud shading, and alpha blending, was incomplete compared to the next generation of 3D chips. The GD546x family was limited by CPU processing at the time, CPU's could not feed it enough triangles which was the <b>real</b> <b>performance</b> block.

2500|$|Since {{its first}} race, the 1988 Brazilian Grand Prix, the Scuderia Italia team had competed in F1 with cars {{designed}} by the Italian racing car constructor Dallara, with occasional success. However, the previous year's Dallara 192 chassis, albeit a points-scorer, had generally been less competitive than hoped for. This was exacerbated {{by the fact that}} Scuderia Italia had made a deal with the Ferrari team to buy its engines that were more powerful than the Judd and Ford used in [...] and before. However, the 1992 season resulted in no <b>real</b> <b>performance</b> gain despite the additional power, suggesting the chassis was at fault.

Gita Jackson at Kotaku said that the marketing fooled her due to how accurate the fan site was to <b>real</b> <b>performance</b> of fandom in the 1990s, and called it {{part of what makes}} the game work, as it sets up nostalgia for the JRPG, making it easier to pretend to be a fan of it within the game.

Father and mother went up to Avonlea. Father thought the change would do mother good, and they wanted to see poor Aunt Diana, whose son Jock had been seriously wounded a short time before. They left Susan and me to keep house, and father expected to be back the next day. But he never got back for a week. That night it began to storm again, and it stormed unbrokenly for four days. It was the worst and longest storm that Prince Edward Island has known for years.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to providing soft realtime guarantees for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. We define what it means for BDI agents to operate in real time, or to satisfy real-time guarantees. We then develop a model of <b>real</b> time <b>performance</b> which takes into account the time by which a task should be performed and the relative priority of tasks, and identify the key stages in a BDI architecture which must be bounded for <b>real</b> time <b>performance.</b> As an illustration of our approach we introduce a new BDI architecture, ARTS, which allows the development of agents that guarantee (soft) <b>real</b> time <b>performance.</b> ARTS extends ideas from PRS and JAM to include goals and plans which have deadlines and priorities, and schedules intentions so as to achieve the largest number of high priority intentions by their deadlines...|$|R
