40|$|These {{guidelines}} {{have been}} prepared for investigators, investigation managers, people who order investigations, responsible persons {{who will have to}} learn from the event, victims and researchers. These guidelines provide a minimum, current and recognised cross-sectorial best practices oversight to conduct investigations related to industrial, technological and organisational events. These guidelines give practical and theoretical advices related to the different stages of such investigations. In-depth analysis of accidents, incidents and crises clearly showed that any event is generated by direct or immediate causes (technical failure and/or ¿ "human error"). Nevertheless their occurrence and/or their development is considered to be induced, facilitated or accelerated by underlying organisational conditions (complex factors) found in socio-technical system and organisational networks. It implies to deal with different natures of causalities: mechanistic met in technical installations and more complex met in human and social systems. Addressing those causalities requires various competencies (with disciplines from exact sciences, to engineering and social sciences) to investigate and to learn from an accident. Accident investigation can be performed for various reasons and objectives. They depend on the stakeholders (many types among companies, authorities, or public parties) and their perspectives. Several investigations could often be managed simultaneously (e. g. judicial, technical,¿) and it may lead to interest and operational conflicts such as the access to the accident scene and witnesses, the collection of the facts, the preservation of evidence, the findings, the communication of findings,¿ Corporate, political, cultural and societal requirements will shape {{the context in which the}} investigation is conducted. This should be cleared and stated when defining the mandate of the investigation. Despite all this variety of contexts, investigation obeys to general principles (protocols, coordination, competence, data and evidence, reporting, follow-up of lessons learned and communication) and to process phases (defining terms of reference, appointing team, collecting data, hypotheses generation, analysis, findings and recommendations). Connection between phases is not a linear process but rather an iterative one. Any investigator gets skills and know-how, so accident investigation is influenced by a priori knowledge or initial models. Specific methodologies have been developed to facilitate some investigation tasks. They use different logical constructions, different underlying models, and address different levels of phenomena with various perspectives (what happened, why it happened and what is recommended to prevent its repetition). Organisations should prepare their protocols and train their investigators before the event occurs in order to be ready to undertake the investigation in an effective way. These guidelines aim to support those processes. To communicate during and after the investigation process is an important issue. Aim is to provide stakeholders with findings through a report or other supports in order to initiate and facilitate the learning process. Many barriers to learn lessons can be faced by organisations. Turning findings into <b>recommendations</b> (<b>corrective</b> <b>measures)</b> is a specific task that requires specific knowledge of the organisational network and the socio-technical system behaviour. The corrective measures can be challenged by reality and a specific follow-up should be put in place. Finally, some future challenges that would have to be addressed by the investigation and safety management communities conclude the present guidelines. JRC. F. 3 -Energy securit...|$|E

40|$|Functional {{strategy}} {{development is}} a vital key lever for any manager to provide direction, and to define the purpose and the value contribution of his organization. In this context, the increasing usage of stakeholder analysis in today's business world confirms the realization that stakeholders' input is an essential tool to shape and influence the decision making process. To that effect, obtaining input on their perceptions, beliefs, intentions and interests represents a valuable instrument for managers to furthermore facilitate the implementation of organizational objectives {{and the development of}} a functional strategy. This paper reviews the fundamental aspects of functional strategies and stakeholder analysis, followed by theoretical approaches of research design and data collection methods, as well as organizational change. In relation to these concepts, it introduces a business area of concern and explains the research framework. A thorough investigation of the research outcomes, their potential origins and boundary conditions will lead to <b>recommendations</b> of <b>corrective</b> <b>measures.</b> The paper proposes the business area concerned to face a major root problem, which suggests being the main cause for multiple related problems that were all detected in the course of the research...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the lack}} of {{high-quality}} workers has increased, and therefore companies have to expend considerable resources to recruit them. Except for financial side, job applicant is interested in setting of the company, relationships at workplace, and values held by the organisation. Especially organisational culture can be a good motivation for employee {{who would want to}} work in a specific company. For obtaining required information, the analysis of technical literature and technical articles has been made as well as the basic concepts relating to the issue were explained. Moreover the method of questioning using survey was applied which was aimed at employees of the chosen company. In addition to that a semi-structure interview with a personal manager of the company was carried out. Given the research results, there were suggested the recommendations for improvement during process of employees recruitment and for motivating potential employees by organisational culture as well as it was suggested to accept another employee for personnel department. The aim of this thesis was to identify components of organisational culture and to evaluate how organisational culture influences the process of recruitment employees in a chosen organisation. The <b>recommendations</b> for <b>corrective</b> <b>measures</b> were processed in the final part of thesis...|$|R

The economic theory, highlighted in particular by the Solow-Swan model, was applied in the current paper, to determine the potential of real convergence. Moreover, the statistics for the period 2005 - 2014 facilitated the analysis of the growth and recession factors specific to economies of Central and Eastern Europe and placed Romania amongst the EU countries with emergent economies and potential of economic growth. The European Commission 2 ̆ 019 s reports regarding the macroeconomic imbalance procedure draw attention on the same indicators presented in the article to address proper <b>recommendations</b> and support <b>corrective</b> <b>measures.</b> Making a step from nominal to real convergence, the latter derives naturally from the need to recoup the gaps in comparison with developed economies amongst countries of the Euro Area...|$|R
