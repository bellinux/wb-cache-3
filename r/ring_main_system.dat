40|$|The non-reliability {{of fossil}} fuels has forced the world to use energy efficiently. These days, it is being {{stressed}} to use the electrical power smartly so that energy does not go waste. And hence comes {{the concept of a}} Smart Grid. So it becomes necessary for reputed places of academics to develop the prototype of the same in their campus. National Institute of Technology (NIT) Rourkela intends to set up a 33 KV Ring Main Distribution System including 33 / 0. 433 KV substations in its campus. The present 11 KV line will be discarded and replaced by the 33 KV system. The main driving force behind this step by the management is to accommodate the stupendously increased power requirement of the institute. The above mentioned plan also includes, set up of Data Acquisition System (DAS) that intends to monitor the electrical equipment in the substations. This is being done not only to increase the accountability and reliability of the distribution system but also to encourage academic research in the distribution automation domain. All in all, an excellent step towards make the Grid, Smart. In this project work the focus is laid on getting load flow solution of the 33 KV <b>ring</b> <b>main</b> <b>system.</b> Here the authors use a specialized algorithm for distribution network with high R/X value to obtain the load flow solution. Then using artificial neural networks computation, algorithms are implemented to do the load forecasting and dynamic tariff setting. At the end a Web Portal, the NITR e-Power Monitoring System is developed that will be an excellent interface to the public in general and will help the students of the institute to know their grid well. In short a conscious effort is put to make the grid more interactive...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Most of the {{developments}} in wave power {{have concentrated on}} {{the conversion of the}} energy in the wave into a form which can be converted into electrical energy by conventional high speed rotary generators. For example in the oscillating water column (OWC) shown in Figure 1, the column produces a low-speed reciprocating linear motion moving at a velocity in the region of 0. 5 to 1 m/s, which is converted to high speed unidirectional rotation by the air duct and Wells' turbine. Other devices such as the Bristol Cylinder and Salter's Duck employ hydraulic <b>ring</b> <b>main</b> <b>systems</b> to convert low speed reciprocating motion into high rotational speed. This mechanical interface required for speed conversion forms the main component of the so-called Electrical & Mechanical Plant (E&M), which according to Thorpe is the most costly part of a WEC [1]. In addition turbines and hydraulic systems contribute to energy losses; {{and in the case of}} hydraulic systems maintenance would be req...|$|R
40|$|The next {{generation}} of lepton flavor violation experiments need high intensity and high quality muon beams. Production of such beams requires sending a short, high intensity proton pulse to the pion production target, capturing pions and collecting the resulting muons in the large acceptance transport system. The substantial increase of beam quality {{can be obtained by}} applying the RF phase rotation on the muon beam in the dedicated FFAG ring, which was proposed for the PRISM project. This allows to reduce the momentum spread of the beam and to purify from the unwanted components like pions or secondary protons. A PRISM Task Force is addressing the accelerator and detector issues that need to be solved in order to realize the PRISM experiment. The parameters of the required proton beam, the principles of the PRISM experiment and the baseline FFAG design are introduced. The spectrum of alternative designs for the PRISM FFAG ring are shown. Progress on <b>ring</b> <b>main</b> <b>systems</b> like injection and RF are presented. The current status of the study and its future directions are discussed.

2500|$|The densest {{parts of}} the Saturnian ring system are the A and B Rings, which are {{separated}} by the Cassini Division (discovered in 1675 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini). Along with the C Ring, which was discovered in 1850 and is similar in character to the Cassini Division, these regions constitute the <b>main</b> <b>rings.</b> The <b>main</b> <b>rings</b> are denser and contain larger particles than the tenuous dusty rings. The latter include the D Ring, extending inward to Saturn's cloud tops, the G and E Rings and others beyond the <b>main</b> <b>ring</b> <b>system.</b> These diffuse rings are characterised as [...] "dusty" [...] {{because of the small}} size of their particles (often about a μm); their chemical composition is, like the <b>main</b> <b>rings,</b> almost entirely water ice.

25|$|The {{separation}} between the A Ring and the F Ring has been named the Roche Division {{in honor of the}} French physicist Édouard Roche.

Lying at the outer edge of the <b>main</b> <b>ring</b> <b>system,</b> the Roche Division is in fact close to Saturn's Roche limit, which is why the rings have been unable to accrete into a moon.|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} near-infrared {{observations of}} the recently discovered outer rings of Uranus with Hubble Space Telescope results. We find that the inner ring, R/ 2003 U 2, is red, whereas the outer ring, R/ 2003 U 1, is very blue. Blue is an unusual color for rings; Saturn’s enigmatic E ring is the only other known example. By analogy to the E ring, R/ 2003 U 1 is probably produced by impacts into the embedded moon Mab, which apparently orbits at a location where nongravitational perturbations favor the survival and spreading of submicron-sized dust. R/ 2003 U 2 more closely resembles Saturn’s G ring, which is red, a typical color for dusty rings. S howalter and Lissauer (1) reported the detection of two faint rings, R/ 2003 U 1 (R 1) and R/ 2003 U 2 (R 2), outside Uranus_s <b>main</b> <b>ring</b> <b>system.</b> R 1, the outer ring, peaks at the orbit of the tiny moon Mab, where-as R 2 orbits between moons Rosalind and Portia but has no visible source bodies.

40|$|The Cassini cameras have {{captured}} the opposition effect in Saturn rings with a high radial resolution at phase angles down to 0. 01 o in the entire <b>main</b> <b>ring</b> <b>system.</b> We derive phase functions from 0. 01 to 25 degrees of phase angle in the Wide-Angle Camera clear filters with a central wavelength of 0. 611 microns and phase functions from 0. 001 to 25 degrees of phase angle in the Narrow-Angle and Wide-Angle Cameras color filters (from the blue 0. 451 microns to the near infrared 0. 752 microns). We characterize the morphology of the phase functions of different features in the <b>main</b> <b>rings.</b> We find that {{the shape of the}} phase function is accurately represented by a logarithmic model (Bobrov 1970, in Surfaces and Interiors of Planets and Satellites, Academic, edited by A. Dollfus). For practical purposes, we also parametrize the phase curves by a simple linear-by-part model (Lumme and Irvine 1976, Astronomical Journal, 81, p 865), which provides three morphological parameters : the amplitude and the Half-Width at Half-Maximum (HWHM) of the surge, and the slope S of the linear-part of the phase function at larger phase angles. Our analysis demonstrates that all of these parameters show trends with the optical depth of the rings. These trends imply that the optical depth is a key-element determining the physical properties which act on the opposition effect. Wavelength variations of the morphological parameters of the surge show important trends with the optical depth in the green filter (0. 568 microns), which implies that grain size effects are maximum in this wavelength.

40|$|A tuned {{mass damper}} (TMD) is a device {{consisting}} of small damped spring-mass system attached to a vibrating <b>main</b> <b>system</b> in order to attenuate any undesirable vibrations. In this paper, optimum parameters of TMD system attached to a viscously damped single degree-of-freedom <b>main</b> <b>system</b> are derived for various combinations of excitation and response parameters. The excitation applied to the <b>main</b> <b>system</b> consists of external force and base acceleration modelled as Gaussian white-noise random process. Using numerical searching technique, the optimum damping and tuning frequency ratio of the TMD are obtained for minimization of various mean square responses such as relative displacement, velocity of main mass and force transmitted to the support. The optimum parameters of the TMD system and the corresponding response quantities are obtained for different damping ratios of the <b>main</b> <b>system</b> and the mass ratios of the TMD system. Explicit formulae for damper damping, tuning frequency and the corresponding minimized response are then derived using curve-fitting technique that can be conveniently used for applications in dynamical systems. The error in these expressions {{is found to be}} negligible and hence these expressions are convenient for use in damped single degree-of-freedom <b>main</b> <b>system.</b> The optimum damping ratio of the TMD is not much influenced by the damping of the <b>main</b> <b>system.</b> However, the optimum tuning frequency of TMD is significantly affected by the damping of <b>main</b> <b>system.</b> Lastly, a comparison of the optimum damping and tuning frequency of the TMD under filtered white-noise and white-noise excitation is also made.
