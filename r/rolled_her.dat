5|$|At the Tour de Corse, Audi debuted the Quattro A2, {{which was}} 70kg (155lb) lighter {{and had an}} engine {{producing}} 30 more horsepower. Mouton's rally ended when her engine caught on fire. On the first stage in Greece, she <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> car on a hairpin turn 18km (11mi) from the start. Rally New Zealand was for Mouton a repetition of the previous year; she took the lead on the seventh stage and held on to it until her A2's engine failed, with only six of the 33 stages to go. The three retirements in a row dropped Mouton to fifth place in the championship. She then finished third behind Mikkola and Blomqvist at the Rally Argentina, but this would remain her last podium finish of the season. At the 1000 Lakes in Finland, Mouton finished the first day in seventh place after setting two top-five stage times. Her car later caught on fire, but {{she was able to}} continue in the event by following Mikkola's advice and driving into a lake. With a string of top-ten times, she eventually finished 16th. In the Rallye Sanremo, the tarmac stages were dominated by the Lancia 037 and Mouton finished seventh after suffering from fuel injection problems. In the season-ending RAC Rally, she started well and held second place after the first twelve stages. An Audi mechanic later accidentally refilled Mouton's fuel tank with pure water which resulted in time-consuming repairs. She eventually retired after crashing out, and placed fifth overall in the drivers' championship. Although Mikkola beat Lancia's Röhrl and Alén to the drivers' title, Audi had lost the manufacturers' title to Lancia after the latter's triple win in Sanremo.|$|E
25|$|Li {{began her}} Australian Open {{campaign}} by cruising {{through the early}} rounds of the tournament, dispatching Ksenia Pervak, Olivia Rogowska, and Anabel Medina Garrigues (after Garrigues retired due to an injured ankle), en route to meeting her 2011 Australian Open final conqueror Kim Clijsters in the fourth round. Kim Clijsters <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> ankle at 3–3 and Li took the first set comfortably. Li held four match points at 6–2 in the second set tiebreak, but dropped six consecutive points to give Clijsters the second set due to unforced errors and poor shot selection. At 1–5 in the final set, Li began a resurgence by reeling off the next three games {{to close the gap}} to 4–5, but the Belgian managed to close out the match. Her unexpected loss left her in tears in her post-match press conference.|$|E
25|$|Clijsters {{entered the}} Australian Open, the last {{appearance}} in the event before her expected retirement. As 11th seed. Clijsters defeated Maria João Koehler and Stéphanie Foretz Gacon {{in the first round}} and second round, respectively. In the third round, she defeated Daniela Hantuchová, 6–3, 6–2, in a rematch of their semifinal encounter at the Brisbane International only a fortnight earlier. Clijsters played Li Na in the fourth round, whom she defeated to win the title in 2011. At 3–3 in the first set, Clijsters <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> ankle and required a medical timeout. Despite being severely hindered in her movement, Clijsters played on, but quickly lost the first set 4–6. She recovered from a break down in the second set to force a tiebreak. Down four match points at 2–6 in the second set tiebreak, she reeled off six consecutive points to take the second set tiebreak, 8–6. She took a 5–1 lead in the final set, but Li recovered, bringing the match to 5–4. However, Clijsters rallied, serving out the match, 4–6, 7–6, 6–4. Clijsters then defeated top seed Caroline Wozniacki, 6–3, 7–6, seemingly unhampered by the ankle sprain she sustained in the previous round. She lost in the semifinals to third seed and eventual winner Victoria Azarenka, 4–6, 6–1, 3–6. Clijsters' ranking dropped to No. 30 after failing to defend her points from winning the title in 2011.|$|E

500|$|Audi had not {{originally}} planned {{to participate in}} the African marathon events, but now found it necessary to enter the penultimate round, the Rallye Côte d'Ivoire, due to their title battles with Opel. Just {{before the start of the}} event, Mouton received news that her father had succumbed to cancer in his house in Nice. His last wish was that Mouton start the rally. After a first day of over 1,200 kilometres (750 miles) of racing in temperatures over 30°C (86°F), she was eight minutes clear of Mikkola and nearly half an hour ahead of title rival Röhrl. Mikkola said that he had never been in such a hot car, and Röhrl estimated that the temperature inside his car reached an [...] "almost unbearable" [...] 70°C. With just over half of the 5,000km (3,100mi) behind, Mouton led from Röhrl by over an hour despite losing 25 minutes due to transmission problems. On the third day, both Mouton and Röhrl struggled with several reliability issues and her lead over Röhrl shrank to 18 minutes. The Toyota Celica GT2000s of Eklund and Waldegård were still over two hours behind. Should Mouton go on to hold off Röhrl, she would reduce Röhrl's lead in the championship to just two points. As a driver's seven best results counted towards the championship at the time, Mouton would only need a third place in the RAC Rally to take the title even if Röhrl would win. On the final day, she continued to suffer from mechanical problems and had the complete fuel injection system changed. For the next time control, Röhrl and Mouton arrived almost simultaneously. With only 600km to go, Mouton went off the road and <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> car. She drove the severely damaged Quattro for five more kilometres before giving up.|$|E
60|$|She seemed stricken. The kindly eyes changed, <b>rolled.</b> <b>Her</b> {{mouth opened}} wide. She gasped and fainted in his arms.|$|E
60|$|The {{young lady}} sighed. She <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> eyes at Mr. Waddington {{in a manner}} which {{was meant to be}} languishing.|$|E
6000|$|No further {{does she}} say, but {{lingering}} all the day, [...] Her high-borne turban'd head she wags, and <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> darkling eye, [...] And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving by.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, little girl. The boat {{will keep}} still to-night, and I don't think there'll be any waves to <b>roll</b> <b>her</b> about to-morrow. We'll have you ashore {{the first thing}} in the morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Keep a good hold, Miss Harding!” {{said one}} of the men beside her. “This boat is trying to <b>roll</b> <b>her</b> funnels out of her, {{and it seems to me}} quite {{possible}} for one to pitch right over the rail.” ...|$|R

60|$|She <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> eyes {{round the}} young men, {{with a long}} sweep of her painted eyelashes, and flashed her yellow teeth at them. She spoke with a cockney accent, but with an {{affectation}} of refinement which made every word a feast of fun.|$|E
60|$|When {{the girls}} had perched {{themselves}} on any available article of furniture, they waited with respectful eagerness, while Sally retired to the hall for a moment, and Julia <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> eyes, with her finger on her lips, looking {{as if she could}} tell much if she dared.|$|E

60|$|She {{positively}} snorted with indignation; she had <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> handkerchief into a ball, and nervously dabbed {{the palms}} of her hands with it. 'I followed you this afternoon, and I saw you go into that 'ouse with that low woman. What now? Eh?' She spoke with the greatest possible emphasis.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Guppy {{acknowledged}} the receipt by {{taking it out}} of his breast-pocket, putting it to his lips, and returning it to his pocket with a bow. Mr. Guppy's mother was so diverted that she <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> head as she smiled and made a silent appeal to Caddy with her elbow.|$|E

5000|$|Vygotsky was a Russian theorist, who {{proposed}} the sociocultural theory. During the 1920s-1930s while Piaget was developing his own theory, Vygotsky {{was an active}} scholar {{and at that time}} his theory was said to be “recent” because it was translated out of Russian language and began influencing Western thinking. He posited that children learn through hands-on experience, as Piaget suggested. However, unlike Piaget, he claimed that timely and sensitive intervention by adults when a child is on the edge of learning a new task (called the zone of proximal development) could help children learn new tasks. This technique is called [...] "scaffolding," [...] because it builds upon knowledge children already have with new knowledge that adults can help the child learn. An example of this might be when a parent [...] "helps" [...] an infant clap or <b>roll</b> <b>her</b> hands to the pat-a-cake rhyme, until she can clap and <b>roll</b> <b>her</b> hands herself.|$|R
