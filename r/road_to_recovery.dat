This article evaluates the R 2 R Program taking into account evidence from the Australian National Audit Office Report Management of the AusLink <b>Roads</b> <b>to</b> <b>Recovery</b> Program.

The team of presidents Amyot, Deschot and Dewailly all struggled to compete with the top teams in the country.

40|$|Which electorates receive {{targeted}} funding, {{and does}} targeted funding swing votes? To answer these questions, I focus on four discretionary programs {{introduced by the}} Australian federal government during the 2001 - 04 election cycle: <b>Roads</b> <b>to</b> <b>Recovery,</b> Stronger Families and Communities, Sustainable Regions, and Regional Partnerships. Together, these programs totalled well over $ 1 billion dollars. Controlling for relevant {{demographic characteristics of the}} electorate, I find that those electorates held by the governing Liberal-National Coalition (particularly those held by the National Party) received a larger share of discretionary funding, and a larger number of program grants. Among government seats, I find no evidence that funding was directed towards those that were more marginal.

As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>recovery,</b> thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E
25|$|The 2012–13 season saw a {{more stable}} squad than had been seen by Grimsby Town in recent years, {{with a total of}} 12 players from the {{previous}} season's squad remaining. The previous season's top scorer Liam Hearn suffered an Achilles tendon injury in pre-season, and although he appeared to be on the <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> when he came on as a substitute against Stockport County, just three days later he injured his leg in training, and tests showed it was an Achilles tendon rupture and he would be out for several months. However, despite the loss of such an important player, and despite not winning 5 games into the season, Grimsby were top of the table by Christmas, with two crucial loan players Ross Hannah and Scott Neilson breathing new life into the Grimsby team. The turn of the year, however, appeared to be a turning point for Grimsby, with Nathan Pond returning from loan to Fleetwood Town and Scott Neilson signing for league rivals Luton Town. The team appeared to lack the quality they had shown {{towards the end of the}} previous year, and despite not losing until mid-February, a run of 4 consecutive losses in March saw them give up the top spot and ultimately fall away from the title race. Despite this, they reached the FA Trophy final, where they played Wrexham at Wembley Stadium on 24 March 2013. Grimsby went ahead in the second half with 20 minutes left to go, through an Andy Cook strike. However, they conceded a penalty with 9 minutes left and Wrexham equalised. This took the game to extra time, and then penalties, where Grimsby lost the shoot-out 4–1. Grimsby finished the season in good form, with a 9 match unbeaten run, finishing the season with a 3–0 win against Newport County. This led them to finish in 4th place with 83 points. They faced Newport County again straight away in the play-off semi-finals, where they were knocked out by a 1–0 loss in both legs. The managerial duo was broken up on 6 September 2013 due to Rob Scott being suspended and Paul Hurst was placed in sole charge of the team.|$|E

Felix Yusupov, one of Rasputin's enemies, suggested that he secretly drugged Alexei with Tibetan herbs which he got from quack doctor Peter Badmayev, but these drugs were politely rejected by the court. For Maria Rasputin, it was magnetism. For Greg King, these explanations fail to take into account those times when Rasputin healed the boy, despite being 2600km (1650 miles) away.
