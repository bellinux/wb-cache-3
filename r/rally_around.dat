5|$|In 1988, the Air Force {{decided to}} close {{three of its}} nuclear weapons {{stations}} at its SAC bases. In addition to Loring, other bases around the world were scaled back. As the B-1B Lancer was now predicted to become the mainstay of nuclear defense for the country, Loring was deemed unnecessary for nuclear weapons stationing. That same year, fears began to surface that Loring would be an {{on the list of}} the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. As a result, the community began to <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> the base, which at the time included 3,800 military personnel, 1,000 civilian employees, generated an $80 million payroll the previous year, and was the subject of $34 million in construction services.|$|E

5|$|By September 1944, Ostojić {{had been}} {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel, and was the Chetnik area commander in eastern Bosnia. In early September 1944, as Mihailović had been removed as Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Force with {{the demise of the}} Purić government-in-exile, Ostojić tried to make contact with Allied forces in Italy, and agreed with Lukačević to issue a proclamation to the people explaining {{that they were going to}} attack the Germans. After 12 September 1944, when King Peter called for all in Yugoslavia to <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> Tito, he and Baćović warned Mihailović that their men were losing their will to fight the Partisans. Concerned that the Russians would hand the Chetniks over to the Partisans, he then contacted the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) liaison officer with the Chetniks, Colonel Robert H. McDowell, but was unable to arrange for the Chetniks to be placed under American command.|$|E

25|$|It was Bryennios' capture that {{precipitated the}} {{military}} nobility to <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> Isaac Komnenos. Fearing that their plot {{was about to}} be discovered, Isaac Komnenos was taken, apparently most unwillingly, by Romanos Skleros, Michael Bourtzes, Nikephoros Botaneiates and the sons of Romanos III Argyros to Gounaria where he was proclaimed emperor on 8 June 1057.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{potential}} leadership contenders, such as Brian Tobin and Allan Rock, declined {{to enter the}} contest.

25|$|On September 21, 2003, Martin easily {{defeated}} his sole remaining opponent, former Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps by securing ninety-three {{per cent}} of the party delegates from across the country. On November 14, 2003, he was declared the winner at the Liberal leadership convention, capturing 3,242 of 3,455 votes. He had won the leadership almost unopposed, due to his hold on the party machinery, and because Chrétien supporters did not <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> either of the leadership opponents.|$|E

Meanwhile, Chauncey's schooners, most of which carried a long 24-pounder or 32-pounder cannon, were bombarding the fort and Government House battery. (Chauncey himself was directing them from a small boat). British return fire was ineffective.|$|E

However, the nobles and the populace of Kakheti continued to <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> the exiled Teimuraz {{in the hope of}} ending their subjection to Iran. In order to end resistance in Kakheti once and for all, Shah Abbas II revived a plan to populate the country with the Turkic nomads, a measure that incited a general uprising in 1659. The rebels succeeded in expelling the nomads but still had to grudgingly accept the shah’s suzerainty.|$|E
25|$|Following the War of 1812, America {{began to}} assert a newfound sense of {{national}}ism.

Under {{the direction of}} Chief Justice John Marshall, the Supreme Court issued a series of opinions reinforcing {{the role of the}} national government.

They released him and occupied Ardebil, but Muhammad soon alienated them and was forced to flee to Tarum. Wahsudan imprisoned him and sent Daisam to Azerbaijan, in the hopes that he could aid the sons of Marzuban against an army sent by Rukn al-Daula and led by Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Razziq. The latter soon decided to withdraw, allowing Daisam to take over Azerbaijan.

25|$|However, {{not all of}} the Army of the Cumberland had fled. Thomas's four {{divisions}} {{still held}} their lines around Kelly Field and a strong defensive position was attracting men from the right flank to Horseshoe Ridge. James Negley had been deploying artillery there on orders from Thomas to protect his position at Kelly Field (although Negley inexplicably was facing his guns to the south instead of the northeast). Retreating men rallied in groups of squads and companies and began erecting hasty breastworks from felled trees. The first regimental size unit to arrive in an organized state was the 82nd Indiana, commanded by Col. Morton Hunter, part of Brannan's division. Brannan himself arrived at Snodgrass Hill at about noon and began to implore his men to <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> Hunter's unit.|$|E
