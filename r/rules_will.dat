5|$|After {{the opening}} on Downtown Line, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan {{announced}} that public transport fare <b>rules</b> <b>will</b> be reviewed {{to allow for}} transfers across MRT lines at different stations as the rail network is getting denser. Currently, commuters are charged a second time when they make such transfers. He added that the Public Transport Council (PTC) will review distance-based fare transfer rules to ensure they continue to facilitate “fast, seamless” public transport journeys. The review of distance-based fare rules on MRT lines {{is expected to be}} completed in the first quarter in 2018.|$|E

25|$|For London Buses, since January 2012 a new Low Emission Zone (LEZ) was adopted, {{with those}} older buses {{selectively}} phasing out (those with no electronic destination displays and older than 12 years old) {{and the remaining}} buses were converted to Euro 3 or 4 standards. The remaining buses began to be upgraded to LECIP EDS. The new Low Emission Zone (LEZ) <b>rules</b> <b>will</b> be carried out from 2015, thus allowing all the Euro II vehicles and Euro III without catalytic standards to be removed. On 1 July 2016 the last Go-Ahead bus, PVL169 was withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|In December 2015, Sweden {{passed a}} {{temporary}} {{law that allows}} the government to oblige all transport companies to check that their passengers carry valid photographic identification. The new law came into effect on 21 December 2015 and is valid until 21 December 2018. The government decided that the new <b>rules</b> <b>will</b> apply from 4 January 2016 until 4 July 2016. The new law led to the mandatory train change and passage though border control at Copenhagen Airport for travellers between Copenhagen and Sweden, and with a reduction in service frequency. Sweden introduced border control from Denmark earlier (15 November 2015), but that could not stop the migrant flow, since {{they have the right}} to apply for asylum once on Swedish ground. First when the transport companies had to stop foreigners on the Danish side, asylum seekers were efficiently stopped. This caused considerable disruption to the train traffic since the railway station did not have capacity for such checks.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Vaseline controversy, the UFC responded by {{implementing}} immediate rule changes on February 7, 2009. These changes were discussed by longtime cutman Jacob [...] "Stitch" [...] Duran. According to Duran, under the new rules, only cutmen who are independent of both corners will be allowed to apply Vaseline to the fighter's faces. However, Duran was not able to confirm whether the <b>rules</b> <b>will</b> apply at all UFC events or just the events that take place in Nevada.|$|E
50|$|These {{rules are}} ordered, so that {{for example the}} prefix-spread rule applies before the left {{deletion}} rule: even if the left deletion rule deletes a high tone from the first syllable of the stem, the prefix spread <b>rule</b> <b>will</b> still operate {{as though it were}} still present. Thus, the application of the prefix spread rule can reveal the underlying tone of the first stem syllable. Moreover, the final two syllables are generally not modified by any of the rules, so that the underlying tones are usually readily apparent there. An exception applies for HH in the last two syllables: either the phrase-final HH <b>rule</b> <b>will</b> convert them to FL, the left deletion <b>rule</b> <b>will</b> delete the first H, giving LH, or the tone dissimilation <b>rule</b> <b>will</b> convert it into HL.|$|R

The League's Annual General Meeting heard proposals that the First Division be expanded to either 20 or 18 teams. Both motions were seconded by Small Heath – not surprisingly, after they as champions had failed to gain promotion while the teams in second and third place had succeeded – but both were defeated, thus confirming that the team would play in the Second Division for the 1893–94 season. Small Heath were to finish that season as runners-up and, this time, achieved promotion to the First Division via the test matches.|$|E

2500|$|Often, [...] "contracts" [...] are set out {{in writing}} to record the formal consent of {{the parties to the}} power exchange, stating their common vision of the {{relationship}} dynamic. The purpose of this kind of agreement is primarily to encourage discussion and negotiation in advance, and then to document that understanding for the benefit of all parties. Such documents have not been recognized as being legally binding, nor are they intended to be. These agreements are binding {{in the sense that the}} parties have the expectation that the negotiated <b>rules</b> <b>will</b> be followed. Often other friends and community members may witness the signing of such a document in a ceremony, and so parties violating their agreement can result in loss of face, respect or status with their friends in the community.|$|E

In other words, only rational beings have the capacity to recognize and consult laws and principles in order to guide their actions. Thus, only rational creatures have practical reason.

[...] A well known more serious source on Dutch etiquette is [...] "Dealing with the Dutch" [...] from Jacob Vossestein: [...] "Dutch egalitarianism is the idea that people are equal, especially from a moral point of view, and accordingly, causes the somewhat ambiguous stance the Dutch have towards hierarchy and status." [...] As always, manners differ between groups. Asking about basic <b>rules</b> <b>will</b> not be considered impolite. [...] "What may strike you as being blatantly blunt topics and comments are no more embarrassing or unusual to the Dutch than discussing the weather."
