5|$|Palsgraf {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the legal world quickly. Dean William L. Prosser of the University of California Law School wrote that the Appellate Division's decision fell into the hands of Professor Francis H. Bohlen of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Bohlen was at that time the Reporter compiling the first <b>Restatement</b> of Torts for the American Law Institute (ALI), and Cardozo was informally one of the advisers. In that task, Bohlen was having difficulty dealing with the concept of duty of care in negligence, especially involving unforeseeable plaintiffs, and Prosser related that Cardozo was treated to a learned discussion by the other advisers of a case that might come before his court and, convinced by the arguments, used them to decide Palsgraf. Kaufman doubted this story, which was told to Prosser by Dean Young B. Smith of Columbia, noting that the only meeting of the advisers between the two appeal decisions in Palsgraf took place in New York on December 12–13, 1927, beginning only three days after the Appellate Division ruled, and the notes reveal that Cardozo was absent; the chief judge was hearing arguments all that week in Albany. Nevertheless, the discussions and materials from the <b>Restatement</b> compilation likely influenced Cardozo in his decision.|$|E

Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist and so it must exist.

40|$|Various {{types of}} {{purchased}} non-audit services (NAS) and their recurring nature affect {{the likelihood of}} financial statement <b>restatements</b> in Malaysia. Based on 953 firm-year observations during the period 2007 – 2009, evidence of a negative relationship between non-audit fees and financial statement <b>restatements</b> is provided. The purchase of both tax-related and audit-related NAS decreases the likelihood of <b>restatements.</b> Recurring (as opposed to non-recurring) tax-related and audit-related NAS are negatively and {{significantly related to the}} likelihood of <b>restatements.</b> These findings support our hypothesis that both types of NAS and their recurrence provide knowledge spillover, which enhances audit and financial reporting quality. When considering institutional settings, we find that politically connected firms are more likely to require financial <b>restatements</b> than non-politically connected firms, while audit committee independence and the purchase of tax-related, recurring tax-related and other NAS decrease this likelihood. The purchase of audit-related and recurring audit-related NAS and non-recurring other NAS decreases the likelihood of <b>restatements</b> for non-politically connected firms...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of family control on the {{likelihood}} of accounting misstatements and on market reactions to subsequent <b>restatements.</b> Using a matched-firm approach, we find that family control overall reduces the incidence of misstatements, consistent with the notion that controlling families have a greater concern for reputation than nonfamily blockholders. However, compared to nonfamily firm <b>restatements,</b> <b>restatements</b> announced by family-controlled firms trigger significantly more negative market reactions. We attribute the more negative market reactions to the greater loss in reputation and higher investor scepticism of the credibility of corporate insiders for family firms than for nonfamily firms following <b>restatements.</b> 27 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Continued {{problems}} with the food supply, coupled the unpopularity {{of some of the}} government's measures, led to widespread press criticism of the Pierlot government. Strikes across the country in February 1945 further destabilised the government. On 7 February 1945, Pierlot publicly defended the actions of the government in parliament, but failed to make a significant impression. The government fell in February, and was replaced by a new, short-lived national union government under Achille Van Acker while the polemic surrounding the possible dismissal or <b>restatement</b> of Leopold III were considered.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's {{original}} arguments received powerful <b>restatement</b> {{and expansion}} from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books {{to the subject}} and was prepared to date {{the writing of the}} work closely in the region of AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style, and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395. Although it was believed that the History Augusta did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period, this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the Historia Augusta does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.|$|E
5|$|Ralph W. Aigler (February 12, 1885 – May 24, 1964) was an American law {{professor}} at the University of Michigan from 19101954, the University's faculty representative to the Big Ten Conference from 1917 to 1955, and chairman of Michigan's Faculty Board in Control of Athletics from 1917 to 1942. Aigler was a renowned expert on real property law and one of the advisors to the American Law Institute in the drafting of the <b>Restatement</b> of the Law of Property. He is best known, however, for his contributions to the athletics programs at the University of Michigan. Aigler's contributions included leading Michigan back into the Big Ten Conference, leading the effort to construct Michigan Stadium, Yost Fieldhouse and other facilities, negotiating the Big Ten's exclusive contract with the Rose Bowl starting in 1946, hiring Fritz Crisler as football coach and athletic director, and acting as a spokesman for the University and Big Ten for many years on NCAA rules and eligibility issues. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1982.|$|E
40|$|There {{is little}} {{research}} on how accounting information quality affects a firm’s external financing choices. In this paper, we use the occurrence of accounting <b>restatements</b> {{as a proxy for}} the reduced credibility of accounting information and investigate how <b>restatements</b> affect a firm’s external financing choices. We find that for firms that obtain external financing after <b>restatements,</b> they rely more on debt financing, especially private debt financing, and less on equity financing. The increase in debt financing is more pronounced for firms with more severe information problems and less pronounced for firms with prompt CEO/CFO turnover and auditor dismissal. Our evidence indicates that accounting information quality affects capital providers’ resource allocation and that debt holders help alleviate information problems after accounting <b>restatements...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} short-term market reaction to financial statement <b>restatements</b> conditional {{on the initial}} level of noise in a restated account. I find evidence suggesting that the initial degree of estimation of restated items is an important determinant of market reaction. Investors do not penalize firms that restate noisy items as much as firms that make mistakes in precise items. Moreover, investors anticipate <b>restatements</b> of less noisy items, while the <b>restatements</b> of items that involve a substantial degree of estimation come as a surprise. ...|$|R
40|$|Do {{financial}} <b>restatements</b> dampen firm performance? One {{argument about}} this is that <b>restatements</b> hurt investor confidence in the credibility of a firm’s disclosure, resulting in a decline in demand for the firm’s securities, thereby, leading to a significant drop in asset price. On the other hand, agency theory suggests that family ownership could have potential benefits to a firm’s performance. An increase in family ownership will have a greater concern for reputation to the controlling family in producing high quality accounting information and, thereby, reduce the likelihood of financial <b>restatements.</b> We evaluate these arguments by distinguishing the effects of <b>restatements</b> on firm performance under two corporate governance environments; family-controlled and CEO duality companies. Based on a sample of Malaysian listed companies in 2008 after the post MCCG 2007 initiative, our findings suggest that (1) <b>restatements</b> dampen firm performance, (2) the dampening impacts of <b>restatements</b> are completely mitigated in family-controlled companies, and (3) the dampening effects are more pronounced in non-family controlled companies than family-controlled companies in non-CEO duality companies. Using this evidence, we recommend that Malaysian regulators develop policies that are unique to the Malaysian markets so as to curtail accounting irregularities. They should reconsider the relevance of requiring CEO nonduality as a practice of good corporate governance and encourage more investment in family-controlled companies...|$|R
5|$|Wilberforce and Clarkson had {{collected}} a {{large volume of}} evidence against the slave trade over the previous two decades, and Wilberforce spent {{the latter part of}} 1806 writing A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, which was a comprehensive <b>restatement</b> of the abolitionists' case. The death of Fox in September 1806 was a blow, but was followed quickly by a general election in the autumn of 1806. Slavery became an election issue, bringing more abolitionist MPs into the House of Commons, including former military men who had personally experienced the horrors of slavery and slave revolts. Wilberforce was re-elected as an MP for Yorkshire, after which he returned to finishing and publishing his Letter, in reality a 400-page book which formed the basis for the final phase of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The tribe then {{appealed the}} case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellate court found that various federal laws {{required}} the DOI and BIA to maintain historic buildings and to maintain Indian trust properties, but that they did not authorize monetary damages. The court then looked to the 1960 act and determined that this act did create a trust relationship that could be enforced with monetary damages. This was based on common law, with the court referencing the <b>Restatement</b> (Second) of Trusts to outline that a trust requires a trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the tribe), and a trust body (the land and buildings). The court noted that both parties agreed that there was a trust, but not that damages were authorized. The court held that where the United States had control over the use and maintenance of the buildings to the exclusion of the tribe, a fiduciary duty was created that authorized the tribe to seek monetary damages. The court then reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court. The United States appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E

While the results of non-restatement-related group complies with the literature that suggested significantly more positive market reactions for Big-Four clients, abnormal returns are more negative for Big-Four clients of restatement-related auditors.

Using a matching sample, we document that accounting <b>restatements</b> drive down price synchronicity.

Further investigations with PIN and ERC/FERC confirm the noise story of price synchronicity following accounting <b>restatements.</b> Our results challenge the dominant view of taking price synchronicity always as an informationbased measure. It implies that caution must be exercised in future research when price synchronicity is taken to measure the level of private information in stock prices...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Secretary of Treasury, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), is required to annually prepare and submit audited financial statements of the U. S. government to the President and Congress. We are required to audit these consolidated financial statements (CFS) and report {{on the results of}} our work. An issue meriting concern and close scrutiny that emerged during our fiscal year 2004 CFS audit was the growing number of Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies that restated certain of their financial statements for fiscal year 2003 to correct errors. Errors in financial statements can result from mathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of accounting principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the financial statements were prepared. Frequent <b>restatements</b> to correct errors can undermine public trust and confidence in both the entity and all responsible parties. Further, when <b>restatements</b> do occur, it is important that financial statements clearly communicate, and readers of the restated financial statements understand, that the financial statements originally issued by management in the previous year and the opinion thereon should no longer be relied on and instead the restated financial statements and related auditor's opinion should be used. Because of the varying nature and circumstances surrounding the <b>restatements,</b> we are issuing a number of separate reports on the matter. This report communicates our observations regarding the National Science Foundation's (NSF) fiscal year 2003 <b>restatements.</b> Going forward, we hope that the lessons learned from the fiscal year 2003 <b>restatements,</b> together with our recommendations, will help (1) NSF avoid the need for <b>restatements</b> to its future financial statements and (2) ensure that NSF's auditor applies appropriate audit procedures in future audits to test for unrecorded and unbilled licensee fees and related internal controls. We reviewed four key areas with respect to the <b>restatements</b> of NSF's fiscal year 2003 financial statements: (1) the nature and cause of the errors that necessitated the <b>restatements,</b> including planned corrective actions by the agency and its auditors; (2) the timing of communicating the material misstatement to users of the financial statements; (3) the extent of transparency exhibited in disclosing the nature and impact of the material misstatement in the financial statements and the reissued auditor's report; and (4) audit issues that contributed to the failure to detect the errors that necessitated the <b>restatements</b> during the audit of the agency's fiscal year 2003 financial statements. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between the amounts obtained using professionally accepted quantitative benchmarks of audit planning materiality and the size of accounting misstatements corrected by financial statements <b>restatements.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a sample of 136 companies (237 company years) that have restated such financial statements and compare the amounts of the <b>restatements</b> with planning materiality benchmarks (rules of thumb) established to aid auditors in arriving at audit planning levels. Findings – It was found that, depending on the method of analysis selected and the materiality benchmark followed, as high as approximately 62 per cent of the <b>restatements</b> involve income levels less than the planning materiality level. Research limitations/implications – The results lead to questions as to the appropriate relationship between the scope of audit procedures, which is in part determined by these quantitative materiality benchmarks, and subsequent financial statement <b>restatements.</b> Originality/value – The issue addressed in this study is important because if audit planning levels for materiality are in excess of the amounts subsequently restated due to accounting misstatements, this might serve as an explanation for a number of recent <b>restatements.</b> Furthermore, it might suggest the need to consider decreasing acceptable materiality planning levels, thus resulting in a recalibration of the audit process.
