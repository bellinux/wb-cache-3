5|$|Australian airmen were {{involved}} in Allied efforts to delay German reinforcements from reaching Normandy throughout June. On the night of 6/7 June, 20 Mosquitos from No.464 Squadron were dispatched to attack German road convoys and trains in northern France. The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons also participated in raids on French towns on this night. While No.463, No.466 and No.467 Squadrons mainly targeted <b>railway</b> <b>facilities,</b> No.460 Squadron formed part of an attack on Vire, which sought to destroy the town to prevent the Germans from using the roads through it. Following these initial raids, Bomber Command continued to target railway infrastructure in France {{in an attempt to}} disrupt the movement of German reinforcements to Normandy. The command operated intensively during the week after the invasion, and some Australian aircrew flew raids on consecutive nights during this period. Overall, Bomber Command made 16 raids against <b>railway</b> <b>facilities</b> in France between 13 and 30 June, of which six included {{at least one of the}} RAAF squadrons. The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF units also took part in several attacks on German supply dumps and airfields during this period. Bomber Command made fewer raids on these targets than had been planned prior to the invasion, however, as its units were frequently assigned to strike facilities associated with the V-1 flying bombs the Germans were launching against the UK. No.464 Squadron also operated against German vehicles travelling at night and bombed railway yards, and flew 75 sorties between the nights of 7/8 and 12/13 June. Overall, the squadron conducted attacks on 19 nights during June, during which five of its aircraft were destroyed. The Australians in 2TAF's other light and medium bomber units also attacked the German lines of communication in France and occasionally provided direct support for the Allied ground forces throughout this period.|$|E
5|$|Australians also {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} Allied air attacks aimed at disrupting movement of German troops and supplies to Normandy during July and August. As well as supporting the ground forces in Normandy and continuing to bomb V-1 flying bomb launch facilities in northern France, Bomber Command attacked <b>railway</b> <b>facilities</b> in France during July and August, and {{at least one of the}} Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in 15 of the 25 raids conducted against these targets. No.464 Squadron also flew more than 350 sorties during July and 400 in August against transport infrastructure in France and convoys of German vehicles. These operations, which were generally conducted at night, cost the unit three aircraft. The only interruption to No.464 Squadron's attacks on transportation came on the night of 14/15 July, when four aircraft piloted by highly experienced airmen conducted a successful precision strike on the Gestapo barracks at Bonneuil-Matours. Australian aircrew assigned to other 2TAF medium bomber and fighter-bomber units also participated in attacks on bridges and railways throughout July.|$|E

25|$|Typically, NKVD Internal Troops were {{defensive}} in nature, {{although they}} played a particularly instrumental role during the Battle of Moscow, the Siege of Leningrad, and the Battle of Stalingrad where the 10th NKVD Rifle Division suffered almost 90% casualties during the battle. Large VV units also stayed in the rear to maintain order, fight enemy infiltrators and to guard key installations (such as the armament manufacturing complex at Tula, protected by the 156th NKVD regiment in 1941) and the railway installations guarded by the 14th <b>Railway</b> <b>Facilities</b> Protection Division NKVD.|$|E
25|$|So it {{was that}} on 2 August 1907 the Act was passed, {{empowering}} the North British Railway to construct Methil no 3 Dock and associated railway connections; the NBR was required to complete {{it as soon as}} possible. Wemyss withdrew his Bill, and in 1908 the NBR let a contract to Robert McAlpine for the no 3 Dock. It was to be located east of the earlier docks and was undoubtedly very large. The single track crossing of the River Leven was to be widened to four tracks, and considerable additional sidings accommodation was to be provided. The <b>railway</b> <b>facilities</b> alone were to cost £50,000. As part of the scheme, Leven Harbour, already badly silted up, was closed.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} third station opened, there were {{doubts about the}} long term {{viability}} of passenger rail services between Lyttelton and Christchurch. The Lyttelton road tunnel would soon become a reality, providing a much more convenient road link between Lyttelton Harbour and the Canterbury Plains. This was expected to enable the growth of road transport as a serious competitor to the railways for the custom of passengers, and concerns were expressed that given this state of affairs, a new station for Lyttelton could not be justified. Despite this, the Minister of Railways John McAlpine announced on 7 August 1962 that the Cabinet had approved a redevelopment of the <b>railway</b> <b>facilities</b> at Lyttelton.|$|E

25|$|Newspaper {{archives}} of the day state that Archer travelled south from Sydney to Port Melbourne on the steamboat the City of Sydney {{with two of his}} trainer Etienne de Mestre’s other horses Exeter and Inheritor, leaving on 18 September 1861 and arriving at Port Melbourne on 21 September. Prior to the Melbourne trip, the horses had arrived in Sydney by steamer from Greenwell Point (near Nowra) on 9 September. Passengers on the City of Sydney included de Mestre and Archer's jockey, John Cutts. Archer travelled by steamboat from Sydney to Melbourne all three times that he raced in Victoria (in 1861, 1862 and 1863). Before <b>railway</b> <b>facilities</b> linked Melbourne to the other states, the only way to transport horses from state to state was by boat. In 1876 de Mestre's entry in the Melbourne Cup, Robin Hood, and ten other horses were lost at sea when the City Of Melbourne was struck by a severe storm off the coast at Jervis Bay.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid-nineteenth}} century East Grinstead, then a small market town, found itself {{excluded}} from {{the development of the}} railway network in the south-east; the nearest town, Godstone, was connected to the South Eastern Railway's (SER) London to Dover line, whilst the London and Brighton Railway's (LBR) Brighton Main Line had linked in Three Bridges as well as the supposedly less important towns of Haywards Heath and Horley. As the town began to lose custom to places with <b>railway</b> <b>facilities,</b> the East Grinstead traders began to clamour for a connection; some landowners and gentry pushed for an extension from Godstone, whilst others were in favour of a branch line from Three Bridges. In 1845 the SER and LBR promoted rival bills for lines through the town, but these both came to nothing: the local townspeople withdrew their support for the SER proposal once it moved the terminus of its line from London Road to a point outside East Grinstead where St Margaret's Junction is now situated. The LBSCR's bill was passed; however, due to a sudden economic crisis this scheme was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|The {{reality was}} {{that many of}} the French {{casualties}} were said to have come from an excess of offensive vigour and on 23 August, General Pierre Ruffey concluded that the infantry had attacked without artillery preparation or supporting-fire during the battle. Early on 24 August, Joffre ordered a withdrawal to a line from Verdun to Mézières and Maubeuge and began to transfer troops from the east, opposite the German border, to the western flank. The French armies were to destroy <b>railway</b> <b>facilities</b> and inflict as many casualties as possible on the German armies while retreating, preparatory to resuming the offensive.

25|$|Regular {{passenger}} train {{service on the}} CVRR ended in 1952, the last New York-Roanoke train ran in 1961. The PRR's successor, the Penn Central, closed all <b>railway</b> <b>facilities</b> in Chambersburg in 1972. Its successor, Conrail, first renamed what had been known as the Cumberland Valley Branch with three names: Shippensburg Secondary Track (Harrisburg to PENNROAD, south-east of Shippensburg); Hagerstown Secondary Track (from the Reading junction north-east of Shippensburg, through PENNROAD, to TOWN and HAGER towers in Hagerstown); and Winchester Secondary Track. Conrail later (1979–1980) abandoned the southern half of the Shippensburg Secondary (from {{the west side of}} Carlisle to Shippensburg, including street-running trackage on Earl St. in the latter town), opting instead to use the Reading connection for freight trains. Instrumental in this realignment was the placement of a wye track at CAPITOL interlocking in Harrisburg. Conrail also abandoned the trackage on the western portion of the CV bridge in Harrisburg, leaving a wye for Amtrak to turn power. The Winchester Secondary was sold to a short line. The Lurgan Branch name, originally used by Conrail for the ex-Reading trackage that passed through Shippensburg to a connection with the Western Maryland, was retained. Norfolk Southern Railway operates the trackage since the 1999 breakup of Conrail.|$|E

The development in this period boosted the Port of Rijeka to rank tenth in transport volume among European ports as it reached a peak in 1913.

The existence and size of the plateau on the northern slope can be verified by examining any topographic map featuring the Pforzheim city area, and the map showing the destroyed city area.
