It enables the low-cost fabrication {{of a wide variety}} of micro components for many different users. Until now, during <b>resist</b> preparation, <b>layers</b> up to 200 mu m thick have been obtained. By using a standard UV mask aligner as an exposure tool followed by immersion development, thick <b>resist</b> <b>layers</b> up to 100 mu m could be patterned in a single step on pre-processed silicon wafers. Repeated exposure and development were successfully used for structuring <b>resist</b> <b>layers</b> of up to 200 mu m thick. High aspect ratios of more than 10, as well as steep edges of more than 88 degrees could be fabricated. The resist patterns were moulded by using pulse or DC electroplating.

40|$|Detailed {{investigations}} {{of the limits of}} a new negative-tone near-UV resist (IBM SU- 8) have been performed. SU- 8 is an epoxy-based resist designed specifically for ultrathick, high-aspect-ratio MEMS-type applications. We have demonstrated that with single-layer coatings, thicknesses of more than 500 km can be achieved reproducibly. Thicker <b>resist</b> <b>layers</b> can be made by applying multiple coatings, and we have achieved exposures in 1200 IJ-m thick, double-coated SU- 8 <b>resist</b> <b>layers.</b> We have found that the aspect ratio for near-UV (400 nm) exposed and developed structures can be greater than 18 and remains constant in the thickness range between 80 and 1200 IJ-m. Vertical sidewall profiles result in good dimensional control over the entire resist thickness. To our knowledge, this is the highest aspect ratio reported for near-UV exposures and the given range of resist thicknesses. These results will open up new possibilities for low-cost LIGA-type processes for MEMS applications. The application potential of SU- 8 is demonstrated by several examples of devices and structures fabricated by electroplating and photoplastic techniques. The latter is especially interesting as SU- 8 has attractive mechanical properties...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{patterning}} method {{used by the}} semiconductor device industry is photolithography -- patterning using light. In this process, the substrate of interest is coated with photosensitive resist and irradiated with short-wavelength light projected through a photomask, which is a specially prepared stencil formed of opaque and transparent regions - usually a quartz substrate with a patterned chromium layer. The shadow of opaque regions in the photomask forms a submicrometer-scale pattern of dark and illuminated regions in the <b>resist</b> <b>layer</b> -- the areal image. Chemical and physical changes occur in the exposed areas of the <b>resist</b> <b>layer.</b> For example, chemical bonds may be formed or destroyed, inducing a change in solubility. This latent image is then developed for example by rinsing with an appropriate solvent. Selected regions of the resist remain, which after a post-exposure bake step form a stable polymeric pattern on the substrate. This pattern {{can be used as}} a stencil in the next process step. For example, areas of the underlying substrate that are not protected by the resist pattern may be etched or doped. Material may be selectively deposited on the substrate. After processing, the remaining resist may be stripped. Sometimes (esp. during Microelectromechanical systems fabrication), the patterned <b>resist</b> <b>layer</b> may be incorporated in the final product. Many photolithography and processing cycles may be performed to create complex devices.|$|E
50|$|Compared to 193i SADP, EUV SADP cost is {{dominated}} by the EUV tool exposure, while the 193i SAQP cost difference is from the added depositions and etches. The processing cost and yield loss at a lithographic tool is expected to be highest in the whole integrated process flow due to the need to move the wafer to specific locations at high speed. EUV further suffers from the shot noise limit, which forces the dose to increase going for successive nodes. On the other hand, depositions and etches process entire wafers at once, without the need for wafer stage motion in the process chamber. In fact, multiple layers may be added under the <b>resist</b> <b>layer</b> for anti-reflection or etch hard-mask purposes, just for conventional single exposure.|$|E
50|$|As with {{immersion}} lithography, defect {{control is}} expected to improve as the technology matures. Defects from the template with size below the post-imprint process bias can be eliminated. Other defects would require effective template cleaning and/or the use of intermediate polymer stamps. When vacuum is not used during the imprint process, air can get trapped, resulting in bubble defects. This is because the imprint <b>resist</b> <b>layer</b> and the template or stamp features are not perfectly flat. There is an elevated risk when the intermediate or master stamp contains depressions (which are especially easy air traps), or when the imprint resist is dispensed as droplets just before imprinting, rather than pre-spun onto the substrate. Sufficient time must be allowed for the air to escape. These effects are much less critical if flexible stamper materials are used, e.g. PDMS. Another issue is adhesion between stamp and resist. High adhesion (sticking) may delaminate resist, which than stays on stamp. This effect degrades pattern, reduces yield and damages stamp. It can be mitigated by employing an FDTS antistiction layer on a stamp.|$|E

5000|$|Split-ring {{resonators}} (SRRs) {{in various}} test configurations {{have been shown}} to be extremely effective as radar absorbers. SRR technology can be used in conjunction with the technologies above to provide a cumulative absorption effect. SRR technology is particularly effective when used on faceted shapes that have perfectly flat surfaces that present no direct reflections back to the radar source (such as the F-117A). This technology uses photographic process to create a <b>resist</b> <b>layer</b> on a thin (about 0.007 in) copper foil on a dielectric backing (thin circuit board material) etched into tuned resonator arrays, each individual resonator being in a [...] "C" [...] shape (or other shape—such as a square).

Not being a closed loop [...] "O", the opening in the [...] "C" [...] presents a gap of specific dimension which acts as a capacitor. At 35 GHz, the diameter of the [...] "C" [...] is near 5 mm. The resonator can be tuned to specific wavelengths and multiple SRRs can be stacked with insulating layers of specific thicknesses between them to provide a wide-band absorption of radar energy. When stacked, the smaller SRRs (high-frequency) in the range face the radar source first (like a stack of donuts that get progressively larger as one moves away from the radar source) stacks of three {{have been shown to}} be effective in providing wide-band attenuation. SRR technology acts very much in the same way that antireflective coatings operate at optical wavelengths. SRR technology provides the most effective radar attenuation of any technologies known previously and is one step closer to reaching complete invisibility (total stealth, [...] "cloaking"). Work is also progressing in visual wavelengths, as well as infrared wavelengths (LIDAR-absorbing materials).|$|E

The calculation outline is demonstrated by an example for an exposure of a 100 nm thick layer of negative tone resist (NTR) resist {{on top of an}} infinitely thick silicon substrate. We use our home built Monte-Carlo simulator for electron-matter interaction for the purpose of lithography. A pattern of an isolated line is written into the <b>resist</b> <b>layer</b> by scanning a beam with 20 keV electrons over an area of 32 nm× 1 μm (width and length). During the exposure, we use a spot size of 20 nm, beam step size of 4 nm and a Poisson distributed exposure dose of 80 μC/cm 2, 60 μC/cm 2 and 40 μC/cm 2. During the exposure of the sample, we record the locations of the inelastic events within the <b>resist</b> <b>layer.</b> The distribution of released acids is determined under the simplified assumption that every inelastic event corresponds to a release. We now construct a three dimensional image of the (in) solubility of the <b>resist</b> <b>layer</b> within a cuboid of 128 nm(256 px) wide, 800 nm(1024 px) in length and 100 nm(128 px) in height. It is obtained by summing the contribution of all acids to every voxel in the three dimensional image. We have used a three dimensional Gaussian with σ x,y,z = r d = 5 nm for the diffusion of the acid. The boundary between exposed and unexposed resist is determined by a threshold. The resulting image of the (in) solubility is analyzed in different ways by considering slices and three dimensional views of the border. The average line edge roughness (LER) is obtained by calculating the standard deviation (one-sigma) of the left and right border from yz-slices. By considering all slices, ranging {{from the top of the}} <b>resist</b> <b>layer</b> to the bottom of the substrate, the average LER as a function of the depth from the top surface of the <b>resist</b> <b>layer</b> is obtained. Shotnoise effects are observed as we decrease the exposure dose. An increased effect of shotnoise is observed near the vacuum and substrate interface.
