The RIVM conclusion was subsequently rewritten to form an environmental synopsis. The present report describes the procedure followed and the results obtained in the evaluation of the environmental effects of these chemicals. Pesticides have been evaluated {{on the basis of the}} test results submitted with regard to their behaviour in soil and water, their effects on organisms present in the environment, such as birds, aquatic organisms (algae, crustaceans and fish), bees and earthworms, and their bioaccumulation potential. Behaviour in soil concerns the <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> <b>route</b> of conversion of a pesticide and its sorption to soil particles.

To accomplish this goal, we identified two additional variables: NPSAT, a measure of morphological skill, and MLU-cw, a measure of utterance length in content words. A growth modelling strategy was used to identify both ’within-child ’ and ’between-child ’ differences in longitudinal data from 36 children. We found that typically developing children indeed use different strategies in lengthening their utterances. We therefore recommend caution in the use of MLU to ’language match’ children when doing research on early language development...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} for evaluating the impact of information aggregation {{on the performance of}} PNNIdriven ATM networks. The routing aggregation scheme, required for optimizing PNNI-driven networks, but not specified by the standards, affects both performances (e. g. call blocking <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> <b>route</b> length) and scalability (e. g. routing table size and routing decision complexity) of these networks. However, to date, very little is still known on how the choice of PNNI configuration parameters influences the network behavior. In order to model the aggregation process, the behavior of a generic link aggregation algorithm is analyzed as a function of its aggressiveness. The physical and logical topology of the network are modeled by Delaunay random graphs. Random geometry considerations are used to obtain closed-form approximations of the blocking probability as function of the parameters of the network, the Quality of Services (QoS) required by incoming calls, and the routing overhead allowed by the crankback and alternate routing mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} problem of maximum {{lifetime}} in wireless sensor networks that are entitled {{with the task of}} estimating an unknown parameter or process. Sensors take measurements and transfer them in multi-hop fashion to a fusion center (FC) for Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation. To engineer the network for lifetime maximization while adhering to estimation error specifications, the number of measurements by each sensor per unit of time (namely, sensor measurement <b>rate)</b> <b>and</b> the <b>routes</b> to the FC are controlled. Sensor spatial correlation, measurement accuracies, link qualities and energy reserves affect sensor measurement <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> the <b>routes</b> to the FC, and, in turn, measurement <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> sensor characteristics impact estimation error. We show that the problem can be decomposed into separate optimization problems where each sensor autonomously takes its measurement <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> routing decisions, and we propose an iterative primal-dual algorithm with low-overhead signaling for solving it.

40|$|We {{present a}} high {{fidelity}} cognitive radio (CR) network emulation platform for wireless system tests, measure-ments, and validation. This versatile platform provides the configurable functionalities {{to control and}} repeat realistic physical channel effects in integrated space, air, and ground networks. We combine the advantages of scalable simulation environment with reliable hardware performance for high fidelity and repeatable evaluation of heterogeneous CR networks. This approach extends CR design only at device (software-defined-radio) or lower-level protocol (dynamic spectrum access) level to end-to-end cognitive networking, and facilitates low-cost deployment, development, and experimentation of new wireless network protocols and applications on frequency-agile programmable radios. Going beyond the channel emulator paradigm for point-to-point communications, we can support simultaneous transmissions by network-level emulation that allows realistic physical-layer inter-actions between diverse user classes, including secondary users, primary users, and adversarial jammers in CR networks. In particular, we can replay field tests in a lab environment with real radios perceiving and learning the dynamic environment thereby adapting for end-to-end goals over distributed spectrum coordination channels that replace the common control channel as a single point of failure. CR networks offer several dimensions of tunable actions including channel, power, <b>rate,</b> <b>and</b> <b>route</b> selection. The proposed network evaluation platfor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a rationale for}} examining second-language acquisition (SLA) using a variationist perspective, and demonstrates how this perspective can help us to understand and explain the process of acquisition of a second language. Data from Liu (1991; under review) show how a learner's participation in different kinds of social interactions resulted in variable production of IL forms at any given point in time, with a consequent alteration of the <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> <b>route</b> of acquisition of English question forms. Systematic interlanguage variation occurs when a learner, at a given point in time,. produces different variants of a particular IL form under different social conditions (e. g. with different interlocutors, or in different physical locations) (cf. Tarone 1979, 1988). A learner may seem to have mastered a given target language (TL) form in one social context, yet in another social context systematically produce a quite different (and possibly inaccurate) variant of that form. Should second-language acquisition theories account for such variation in interlanguage performance? Variationist and non-variationist researchers give different answers to that question. Non-variationist theoreticians (e. g. White 1989; Gregg, 1990; 1993) focus upon internal mental processes and model an abstract (non-contextualized) competence, discounting the importance of variatio...|$|E

Descriptions of two study designs presented here represent the possible extremes in approaches to toxicokinetic studies. The comprehensive approach is geared toward the development of physiology based pharmacokinetic models that relate external exposure to target organ dosimetry and addresses the questions: Is the chemical absorbed? How is the chemical metabolized? Where are the chemical and/or metabolites distributed in the body? What are the elimination <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> <b>route</b> of the chemical? What is the effect of dose on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination? The minimal study design is more limited in scope than the comprehensive design and addresses primarily the issues of absorption, distribution, and elimination of the parent chemical. Study protocols for most chemicals lie somewhere between these two extreme approaches. An increased understanding of the relationships between external exposure, target organ dosimetry, and adverse effects should provide greater confidence in making low-dose extrapolations of human risk. This paper focuses on the collection of data from animal toxicokinetic studies. The construction of comparable models to characterize target organ dosimetry in exposed humans would certainly require the use of human parameter values obtained from human tissue samples and volunteers...|$|E
