50|$|This {{was also}} a time of {{increasing}} use of technology in retail banking. In 1959, banks agreed on a standard for machine readable characters (MICR) that was patented in the United States for use with cheques, {{which led to the}} first automated <b>reader-sorter</b> machines. In the 1960s, the first Automated Teller Machines (ATM) or Cash machines were developed and first machines started to appear {{by the end of the}} decade. Banks started to become heavy investors in computer technology to automate much of the manual processing, which began a shift by banks from large clerical staffs to new automated systems. By the 1970s the first payment systems started to develop that would lead to electronic payment systems for both international and domestic payments. The international SWIFT payment network was established in 1973 and domestic payment systems were developed around the world by banks working together with governments.|$|E
40|$|The {{motivation}} for {{this paper is}} a problem faced by banks which process large volumes of deposited checks. The checks must be separated by bank number before shipment to the Federal Reserve or other banks. The sorting is usually accomplished using a <b>reader-sorter</b> which reads the magnetic ink characters on the checks and separates them into different "pockets. " This paper characterizes the optimal sorting strategy and describes an efficient procedure for finding the optimal solution for problems of the size generally found in practice. The algorithm {{is based on a}} two state dynamic programming recursion in which characterization theorems are used to drastically reduce the size of the state space and in which the storage requirements are minimal. The paper includes an analysis of computational experience and describes how the algorithm {{can be used in a}} real time environment with deadlines. ...|$|E
