5|$|Ford seriously {{considered}} leaving the Senate and <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> again in 1983 and 1991, but {{decided against it}} both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in the Senate and desire to become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to run for governor.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the social}} circumstances, {{politically}} oriented social problem films ridiculed politicians and portrayed them as incompetent bumblers, scoundrels, and liars. In The Dark Horse (1932), Warren William is again enlisted, {{this time to}} get an imbecile, who is accidentally in the <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Governor,</b> elected. The candidate wins the election despite his incessant, embarrassing mishaps. Washington Merry-Go-Round portrayed the state of a political system stuck in neutral. Columbia Pictures nearly released the film with a scene of the public execution of a politician as the climax before deciding to cut it.|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, Barkley {{announced}} that he would be <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Governor</b> of Alabama in 2014 as an Independent. On October 27, 2008, he officially announced his candidacy for Governor of Alabama in an interview with CNN, stating that he planned to run in the 2014 election cycle, but he began to back off the idea in a November 24, 2009 interview on The Jay Leno Show. In 2010, he confirmed that he was not running in 2014. In 2016, Barkley once more turned Republican, when he endorsed John Kasich for the office of President in the 2016 election.|$|E
5|$|On October 21, President Truman {{appointed}} prosecutor John McGohey {{to serve}} as a U.S. District Court judge. Judge Medina was hailed as a national hero and received 50,000 letters congratulating him on the trial outcome. Oakes, p 1460 ("national hero"). On October 24, Time magazine featured Medina on its cover, and soon thereafter he was asked to consider <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> of New York. On June 11, 1951, Truman nominated Medina to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where he served until 1980.|$|E

Kane marries Susan and forces her into a humiliating operatic career for which she has neither the talent nor the ambition.|$|E
5|$|As {{the coal}} boom began to wane, Patton sold {{most of his}} coal {{interests}} in 1978. After a meeting with allies of his friend, First District Congressman Carroll Hubbard, in Madisonville on September 20, 1978, Patton considered <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> in 1979. However, he subsequently decided that he lacked the time to organize a campaign before the May primary election; a letter leaked to the Paducah Sun showed that he believed he was losing Hubbard's support. He joined Terry McBrayer's campaign during the primary, and after McBrayer lost, he worked to elect John Y. Brown, Jr., the Democratic nominee. Brown won the election, and Patton was appointed deputy secretary of transportation. He served only three months before resigning to protest Brown's proposal for a coal severance tax.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{never again}} sought an elected office after his defeat by Morton, though he {{remained}} active in state politics {{and continued to}} lead the anti-Chandler faction of his party. From 1957 to 1959, {{at the insistence of}} Lyndon Johnson, he served {{as executive director of the}} United States Senate Democratic Campaign Committee and helped ensure the election of a fourteen-seat Democratic majority in the Senate. He considered <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> again in 1959, but ultimately decided against it. Without Clements in the race, the anti-Chandler faction was unable to unite behind either former candidate Bert T. Combs or former Louisville mayor Wilson Wyatt. Clements united the faction behind Combs, making Wilson Wyatt their candidate for lieutenant governor and promising him support for later races. Combs defeated the Chandler candidate, Harry Lee Waterfield in the Democratic primary and went on to win the general election.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} in office, Combs was {{appointed}} to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals by President Johnson. He served for three years before resigning and <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> again in 1971. He lost in the Democratic primary to Wendell Ford, his former executive secretary. In 1984, Combs agreed to represent sixty-six of the state's poor school districts in a lawsuit challenging the state's system of financing public education. The suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, resulted in the Kentucky Supreme Court declaring the state's entire system of public schools unconstitutional. In response, the Kentucky General Assembly drafted a sweeping education measure known as the Kentucky Education Reform Act in 1991. On December 3, 1991, Combs was caught in a flash flood while driving and was killed.|$|E
5|$|As the {{celebrations}} {{in honor of}} Scott's military career continued across Kentucky, he began {{to consider the possibility}} of <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> in 1808. By mid-1806, state senator Thomas Posey and Lexington lawyer Thomas Todd had already declared their candidacies. Posey had been chosen speaker pro tem of the state Senate and, with the death of Lieutenant Governor John Caldwell in 1804, had assumed the role of acting lieutenant governor and presiding officer in the Senate. He subsequently lost his senatorial re-election bid, but continued to act as lieutenant governor and preside over the Senate. His opponents claimed that since he was no longer a member of the Senate, he was not qualified to act as lieutenant governor; additionally, they charged that he was sympathetic to the hated Federalist Party, even though he self-identified as a Democratic-Republican. Although he was not successfully unseated as the Senate's presiding officer, the controversy diminished his chances in the 1808 election. In 1807, Todd removed himself from contention as well, accepting Governor Greenup's appointment to the Kentucky Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{supporters}} {{believed he}} would again seek the governorship of Kentucky or be {{appointed to the}} Supreme Court of the United States in the early 1950s; some even formed a committee to elect Cooper president. Cooper considered <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> in 1951, but when Chapman {{was killed in an}} automobile accident on March 8, 1951, he decided to make another run for the Senate against Thomas R. Underwood, Governor Lawrence Wetherby's appointee to fill the vacancy. Underwood was considered a heavy favorite in the race. Some Republicans faulted Cooper for taking an appointment from Democrat Truman. Both the Louisville Times and the Louisville Courier-Journal recanted their statements in 1950 for Cooper to seek election to the Senate in 1954. They now feared that the election of a Republican would allow that party to organize the Senate, giving key committee chairmanships to isolationists opposed to continued US involvement in the Korean War. Nevertheless, Cooper defeated Underwood by 29,000 votes in the election and served out the remainder of Chapman's term. His victory marked the first time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been elected to the Senate more than once.|$|E

5|$|After {{announcing his}} plans for the World Coal Center, Wilkinson began {{attending}} meetings of the Lexington Urban City Council, where he advocated his fiscally conservative political views. He was an admirer of Ronald Reagan, although he said he wished Reagan was a Democrat like himself. In 1979, Wilkinson became involved with Terry McBrayer's campaign against John Y. Brown, Jr. in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. He held a critical fundraiser for Scotty Baesler's 1981 Lexington mayoral campaign, although most of the businessmen in Lexington favored Baesler's opponent. In the 1983 Democratic gubernatorial primary, he served as finance chairman for Harvey Sloane's campaign. When Sloane lost a close race to Lieutenant Governor Martha Layne Collins, Republican nominee Jim Bunning tried to enlist the support of Sloane and his supporters, including Wilkinson. After a month of consideration, however, Wilkinson endorsed the entire Democratic ticket. The following year, he managed former governor Brown's brief senatorial campaign. Already considering <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> in 1987, Wilkinson had hoped to remove Brown as a potential competitor for that office by helping him get elected to the Senate, but Brown ended his campaign early for health reasons. Through his work in various the campaigns, Wilkinson found that he enjoyed the challenges of competing in the political arena. He lobbied the General Assembly to pass a multi-bank holding company bill allowing banking companies to own more than one Kentucky bank. The bill passed in 1984.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Jones {{announced}} his candidacy for lieutenant governor, admitting {{that he considered}} the office a stepping stone to some day becoming governor. He was elected, but experienced a poor relationship with Governor Wallace Wilkinson throughout their four-year terms. Jones was elected governor in 1991, turning back a challenge from Governor Wilkinson's wife Martha in the Democratic primary. (Wilkinson was ineligible to succeed himself in office.) Although Jones maintained a strained relationship with the Kentucky General Assembly following comments he made {{in the wake of}} the federal Operation Boptrot investigation, he was still able to pass much of his agenda, including an amendment that would allow state officials to succeed themselves in office once. (Jones was able to secure passage of the amendment by exempting the state's sitting officials, including himself.) However, he achieved only a partial victory on his top priority– health care reform. While the legislature acceded to many of Jones' proposals, such as eliminating the practice of denying insurance coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, they did not approve his mandate for universal health care for all Kentuckians. Following his term in office, Jones founded the Kentucky Equine Education Project. He considered <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> again in 2003, but never formally became a candidate.|$|E
