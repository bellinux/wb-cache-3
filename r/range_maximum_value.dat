The average of mean statistics from 40 -simulation prediction sets of an independent 78 -plot validation dataset differed from the observed validation means by 0. 5 cm for DBH, and by 12 trees/h for density. The 40 -simulation average of standard deviation, quartile <b>range,</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> and minimum value differed from the validation dataset, respectively, by 0. 3, 1. 3, 0. 6 and 1. 5 cm for DBH, and 10, 42, 29, and 54 trees/h for density. In addition, test statistics were also computed individually {{for each of the}} 40 single simulations of the 78 -plot validation dataset. In all cases, the test statistics supported the null hypothesis of no difference between simulated and observed DBH lists. When power of these hypothesis test statistics was set to 80 %, the calculated minimum detectable differences were still reasonably small at 2. 7 cm for mean DBH and 90 trees/h for stocking. Also, the shape and dispersion of simulated mean-DBH/density scatter graphs were similar to the same scatter graph from the observed, validation dataset...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetoelectric effect}} in multiferroic {{materials}} {{has been widely}} studied for its fundamental interest and practical applications. The magnetoelectric effect observed for single phase materials like Cr 2 O 3, BiFeO 3, and Pb(Fe 0. 5 Nb 0. 5) O 3 is usually small. A much larger effect can be obtained in composites consisting of magnetostrictive and piezoelectric phases. This paper investigates the magnetoelectric effect of a multilayer (laminated) structure consisting of 6 nickel ferrite and 7 PFN relaxor layers. It describes the synthesis and tape casting process for Ni 0. 3 Zn 0. 62 Cu 0. 08 Fe 2 O 4 ferrite and relaxor PbFe 0. 5 Nb 0. 5 O 3 (PFN). Magnetic hysteresis, ZFC - FC curves and dependencies of magnetization versus temperature for PFN relaxor and magnetoelectric composite were measured with a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) in an applied magnetic field up to 85 kOe at a temperature range of 10 – 400 K.

Here we report the design, fabrication, optical characterization and thermal tuning responses of cascade of multiple microresonators (MR) developed on the CA UV 210 polymer by DUV lithography procedures. Families of various MR have been investigated with different shapes and geometrical dimensions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) supports the fabrication quality. The experimental TE modes resonance transmissions show a relevant agreement in the period of the resonances theoretically expected. A systematical study through Q-factor has been performed for the devices based on single and multiple resonators. Cascade of multiple loops demonstrates enhancement of the optical transmission properties respect to the photonic devices with only one cavity and the ability to act as modal filter by providing more uniform pass band over a wider wavelength <b>range.</b> <b>Maxima</b> <b>values</b> of Q = 4 x 10 ^ 3 were obtained for the cascade of triple racetrack MR.

The method is built on the observation that, for diffuse pixels, the intensity ratios between the <b>maximum</b> <b>values</b> and <b>range</b> <b>values</b> (<b>maximums</b> minus minimums) are independent of surface geometry. The specular fractions of the image pixels can then be computed by using the intensity ratio.

Centrifugation-based size-selection {{was used to}} give dispersions of nanosheets with aspect ratio (length/thickness) of ~ 1400. Such dispersions {{can be used to}} produce polyvinylalcohol-BN composite films. Helium ion microscopy of fracture surfaces shows the nanosheets to be well dispersed and the composites to fail by pull-out.

The rates of increase are extremely high; dY/dVf = 670 GPa and d?B/dVf = 47 GPa. The former value matches theory based on continuum mechanics while the latter value is consistent with remarkably high polymer-filler interfacial strength.

Single films and multilayers of HfO_ 2, ZrO_ 2, Y_ 2 O_ 3 and SiO_ 2 were deposited on fused silica substrates. The refractive {{index of the}} laserdeposited, amorphous films were {{higher than those of}} electron beam evaporated comparable specimens. The rms-roughness is measured to 1 - 3 nm by LFM and a columnar structure with grain boundaries parallel to the substrate's surface is recognised by TEM. A qualitative behaviour between absorption and laser damage threshold is regarded in the uv- and near ir-spectral range. The laser damage threshold exhibit also an exponential dependence on the energetic position of the uv-band gap (50 %-transmission). The partial pressure of water dominates the process of desorption from an uncoated fused silica substrate during irradiation by a cw-CO_ 2 laser. A crystalline structure, higher rms-roughness and modified uv-transmission were the results of substrate irradiation by a cw-CO_ 2 laser during film deposition. The laser damage threshold is decreased in the ir- and increased in the uv-spectral <b>range.</b> <b>Maximum</b> <b>values</b> of the refractive index, which depends on the laser power, were found for HfO_ 2 and ZrO_ 2 at P_L = 60 W and P_L = 40 W for Y_ 2 O_ 3. The dependence of the refractive index on the applied laser power for substrate irradiation is used for the preparation of a single material multilayer (ZrO_ 2). Parallel of the LLBE deposited films also in LEBE-technique (laser assisted electron beam evaporation) prepared specimens were investigated with qualitatively similar results. The most probably mechanism for the formation of Si_ 2 from SiO in the present of O_ 2 under uv-irradiation is clarified by experiments of laser supported, reactive deposition of SiO_x films on fused silica substrates. The laser treatment of deposited oxide films yielded a desorption of water from the specimen during the irradiation and a decreased uv-transmission. The films were also transformed into a crystalline state with higher rms-roughness and low laser damage thresholds. (orig.)

40|$|Understanding how {{bone marrow}} mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) {{contribute}} to {{new bone formation}} and remodelling in vivo is of principal importance for informing the development of effective bone tissue engineering strategies in vitro. However, the precise stimuli for osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vivo have not been fully established. The work presented in this thesis uses a combination of experimental and computational modelling approaches to investigate the in vivo environment of the stem cell niche in bone marrow, with a specific goal of identifying important biochemical and mechanical cues for osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Support cells within the niche are examined for their roles in osteogenic differentiation. Specifically osteocytes and osteoblasts are examined due to their established role as regulatory cells in bone. Osteocytes {{are found to be}} more dominant than osteoblasts. However, when cultured together, a synergistic relationship is found to exist between them, for stimulating the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Fluid structure interaction (FSI) models are used to determine whether MSCs can be directly stimulated by mechanical cues within the bone marrow. Models predict that the shear stress generated due to physiological loading is within the stimulatory <b>range</b> (<b>maximum</b> <b>values</b> <b>range</b> from 0. 025 - 0. 25 Pa). Additionally, it is found that the onset of osteoporosis can alter the shear stress within the marrow. Explanted samples of trabecular bone and marrow are physiologically compressed and are found to have greater osteogenic activity, as verified by bone histomorphometry, compared to static samples. FSI models demonstrate that bone strain, not marrow shear stress, is likely the driving mechanical signal during compression. To focus on shear stress in the marrow, low-magnitude high-frequency vibration loading is used as this induces minimal bone strain while generating marrow shear stress. Âµ-CT analysis shows strong bone formation and remodelling in vibration samples compared to static samples. Computational models reveal a significant relationship between this formation and remodelling and shear stress in the marrow. Together the results of this PhD thesis demonstrate that: (1) osteocytes and osteoblasts can stimulate osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. (2) Shear stress of sufficient magnitude to stimulate the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, is generated during compression, but this can be altered in osteoporotic bone. (3) In vivo responses of bone to compression loading are replicated in explanted samples; however, models indicate that bone strain is the dominant signal. Finally, (4) explanted samples exposed to vibrational loading experience more marrow shear stress than in compression loading, and the magnitude of the shear stress has a causal role in the formation of bone and improvement in bone architecture parameters...|$|R

Much of the existing literature on the topic concentrates on downtown cores and calls {{for the application of}} maximum parking allowances to limit supplies. This thesis presents an analysis of existing suburban parking supplies in order to quantify parking maxima. The total number of spaces provided, footprint required to accommodate the spaces and the employment to which parking is providing are quantified. The totals are separated by different land use categories and quantities of employment are normalized to account for high trip-generating jobs such as retail. Parking supplies are examined as a function of traditional land use market theory and across primary land use categories. The results indicate that employment is a fairly weak indicator of parking supply, while weighted employment that considers the effects of retail is a much stronger indicator. On average, very high and very low land use densities have the lowest parking requirements per employee (0. 39 spaces per employee) while moderate land use densities have the least diversity of land use, yet the highest supply of employee parking (4. 01 spaces per employee). The methodology applied may be used to produce quantitative maxima to be incorporated into local parking bylaws that are recognized as potentially strong TDM tools.

The vegetation and other characteristics of the Knersvlakte have been reported by Cowling et al. (1999). Large tracts of the Knersvlakte are covered by a layer of quartz stones (Figure  1 A), within which a distinct quartz field flora occurs (Schmiedel 2002). The importance of these quartz fields, which vary in size, was stressed by Schmiedel (2002), who pointed out that they represent a biodiversity hotspot with 150 taxa (species and subspecies), 121 (80.7 %) of them being endemic and occurring obligatorily in quartz fields.

It {{can be used}} for any growth model and small sample sizes. Bootstrapping is used to generate confidence regions for the model parameters and for size and growth rate at age. Significance of differences between growth patterns is tested with a likelihood ratio test, the validity of which was confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. As an illustration of the applicability of this approach, we analyzed a set of length-at- age data on female (N = 57) and male (N = 27) Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis from a shallow, eutrophic Dutch lake, Tjeukemeer. We used the von Bertalanffy growth curve to model length at age for both sexes separately. This analysis showed a significant difference in length between males and females between age 2 and age 6, with females being larger. At older ages the confidence regions became too wide to detect sexual dimorphism. The applicability of our approach was furthermore shown by comparing the results for Tjeukemeer with existing data for two other lakes. Eurasian perch in IJsselmeer (The Netherlands) showed comparable maximum lengths and dimorphism among sexes, but significant lower initial growth rates. Eurasian perch in Lake Windermere (UK) showed significantly lower maximum lengths; initial growth rates showed a wide <b>range,</b> with <b>maximum</b> <b>values</b> equal to those of Tjeukemeer.

The analysis also indicated that, for the given earthquake magnitude and PGA, the liquefiable soil layers are characterized by a <b>range</b> of <b>maximum</b> KD <b>value</b> from 2. 1 to 3. 7. </p...|$|R
40|$|A three {{dimensional}} {{rheological model}} has been developed in the Betic-Rif and Alboran Sea region to characterize the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) in the upper crust; calculating a multiple set of regularlyspaced strength profiles based on a synthetic 3 D lithospheric structure that gathers most of the available geological and geophysical data in the region. This is the first numerical modelling calculated in the region, for either compressional or tensional tectonic regimes, to characterize the rheological layering of the crust in the Betic-Rifean belt. The model results in a BDT topology highly constrained by the lithospheric thickness. The upper-crust brittle domain gets thinnest in the East Alboran Basin and {{the transition to the}} South Balearic Basin (7 and 6 km for tensional and compressional tectonic regimes), and becomes thicker westwards, getting the major values in the West Alboran Basin, near the Gibraltar Arc (18 - 16 km). In the onshore Betics, the BDT deeps towards the NW, with a general trend that results to be oblique to the shore line and to the main orientation of the mountain <b>ranges,</b> with a <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> in the Southiberian Domain (~ 15 - 12 km) continued by a gently thinning of the brittle domain towards the Iberian forelan...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{examination}} of existing field results, an empirical equation {{has been suggested}} for estimating the likely <b>range</b> of the <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> of the net lateral displacement (δ nm) of ground improved by the installation of prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) and subjected to the combined effects of vacuum pressure and embankment loading. The effects on lateral displacement of the magnitudes of embankment loading, {{as well as the}} vacuum pressure, the loading rate, and the undrained shear strength and consolidation properties of the soil deposit, have been explicitly included in a newly defined parameter, which is given by the ratio of an index pressure to the representative soil shear strength (RLS). The ratio of δ nm to the surface settlement under the embankment centreline, S f, is also defined as the normalised maximum (net) lateral displacement (NLD). A direct relationship between RLS and NLD has been proposed, with a prescribed range, {{based on the results of}} 18 field case histories from 12 different project sites in five countries. It is suggested that the proposed relationship can be used as a preliminary design tool for preloading projects involving combinations of a vacuum pressure and an embankment pressure as well as PVD improvement...|$|R
40|$|Wind instrumentalists {{require a}} {{sophisticated}} functioning of their respiratory system {{to control their}} air stream, which provides the power for optimal musical performance. The air supply must be delivered into the instrument in a steady and controlled manner and with enough power {{by the action of}} the expiratory musculature to produce the desired level of sound at the correct pitch. It is suggested that playing posture may {{have an impact on the}} abdominal muscle activity controlling this expired air, but there is no research on musicians to support this theory. This study evaluated chest and abdominal expansion, via respiratory inductive plethysmography, as well as activation patterns of lower and upper abdominal musculature, using surface electromyography, during performance of a range of typical orchestral repertoire by 113 woodwind and brass players. Each of the five orchestral excerpts was played in one of four randomly allocated postures: standing; sitting flat; sitting inclined forwards; and sitting inclined backwards. Musicians showed a clear preference for playing in standing rather than sitting. In standing, the chest expansion <b>range</b> and <b>maximum</b> <b>values</b> were greater (p< 0. 01), while the abdominal expansion was less than in all sitting postures (p< 0. 01). Chest expansion patterns did not vary between the three sitting postures, while abdominal expansion was reduced in the forward inclined posture compared to the other sitting postures (p< 0. 05). There was no significant variation in abdominal muscle activation between the sitting postures, but the level of activation in sitting was only 2 / 3 of the significantly higher level observed in standing (p< 0. 01). This study has demonstrated significant differences in respiratory mechanics between sitting and standing postures in wind musicians during playing of typical orchestral repertoire. Further research is needed to clarify the complex respiratory mechanisms supporting musical performance...|$|R
40|$|Nonadiabatic loss {{processes}} of radiation belt energetic electrons include precipitation {{loss to the}} atmosphere due to pitch-angle scattering by various magnetospheric plasma wave modes. Here we consider electron precipitation loss due to pitch-angle scattering by whistler-mode ELF hiss in plasmaspheric plumes. Using wave observations and inferred plasma densities from the Plasma Wave Experiment on the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES), we analyze plume intervals for which well-determined hiss spectral intensities are available. We then select 14 representative plumes for detailed study, comprising 10 duskside plumes and 4 nonduskside plumes, with local hiss amplitudes <b>ranging</b> from <b>maximum</b> <b>values</b> of above 300 pT to minimum values of less than 1 pT. We estimate the electron loss timescale τ loss due to pitch-angle scattering by hiss in each chosen plume {{as a function of}} L-shell and electron energy; τ loss is calculated from quasi-linear theory as the inverse of the bounce-averaged diffusion rate evaluated at the equatorial loss cone angle. We find that pitch-angle scattering by hiss in plumes can be efficient for inducing precipitation loss of outer-zone electrons with energies throughout the range 100 keV to 1 MeV, though the magnitude of τ loss can be highly dependent on wave power, L-shell, and electron energy. For 100 - to 200 -keV electrons, typically τ loss ∼ 1 day while the minimum loss timescale (τ loss) min ∼ hours. For 500 -keV to 1 -MeV electrons, typically (τ loss) min ∼ days, while (τ loss) min < 1 day in the case of large wave amplitude (∼ 100 's pT). Apart from inducing direct precipitation loss of MeV electrons, scattering by hiss in plumes may reduce the generation of MeV electrons by depleting the lower energy electron seed population. Models of the dynamical variation of the outer-zone electron flux should incorporate electron precipitation loss induced by ELF hiss scattering in plasmaspheric plumes...|$|R
40|$|Submicron aerosol {{particles}} (Dp< 1 μm) were sampled with stacked filter units on the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Hercules C- 130 aircraft during February-March 1999 as {{a contribution to}} the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX). We determined the vertical and spatial distribution of the major aerosol components (NH 4 +, Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, methyl sulfonic acid, Cl-, NO 3 -, SO 42 -, oxalate, organic carbon, and black carbon) over the Indian Ocean to examine the role of pollution aerosols on indirect and direct radiative forcing. High pollution levels were observed over the entire northern Indian Ocean down to the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) located between the equator and 10 degreesS. In {{the northern part of the}} Indian Ocean (5 - 15 degreesN, 66 degrees- 73 degreesE), high concentrations of carbonaceous aerosol and pollution- derived inorganic species were found in a layer extending from the sea surface to about 3. 5 km asl. In this layer, the average mass concentration of all aerosol species detected by our technique ranged between 7 and 34 mug m(- 3), comparable to pollution levels observed in industrialized regions. In the Southern Hemisphere (1 degrees- 9 degreesS, 66 degrees- 73 degreesE), the aerosol concentrations rapidly declined to remote background levels of about 2 mug m(- 3). The concentrations of non-sea-salt sulfate (the main light scattering component) <b>ranged</b> from <b>maximum</b> <b>values</b> of 12. 7 mug m(- 3) in the Northern Hemisphere to 0. 2 mug m(- 3) in the Southern Hemisphere. Carbonaceous aerosol contributes between 40 % and 60 % to the fine aerosol mass of all determined components. An unusually high fraction of black carbon (up to 16 % in the polluted areas) is responsible for its high light absorption coefficient...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{coastal areas}} with {{complicated}} flow movement, deposition and scour readily occur in submarine excavation projects. In this study, a small-scale model, {{with a high}} resolution in the vertical direction, was used to simulate the tidal current around a submarine excavation project. The finite volume method was used to solve Navier-Stokes equations and the Reynolds stress transport equation, and the entire process of the tidal current was simulated with unstructured meshes, generated in the irregular shape area, and structured meshes, generated in other water areas. The meshes near the bottom and free surface were densified with a minimum layer thickness of 0. 05  m. The volume of fluid method was used to track the free surface, the volume fraction of cells on the upstream boundary {{was obtained from the}} volume fraction of adjacent cells, and that on the downstream boundary was determined by the water level process. The numerical results agree with the observed data, and some conclusions can be drawn: after the foundation trench excavation, the flow velocity decreases quite a bit through the foundation trench, with reverse flow occurring on the lee slope in the foundation trench; the swirling flow impedes inflow, leading to the occurrence of dammed water above the foundation trench; the turbulent motion is stronger during ebbing than in other tidal stages, the <b>range</b> with the <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> of turbulent viscosity, occurring {{on the south side of}} the foundation trench at maximum ebbing, is greater than those in other tidal stages in a tidal cycle, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> of Reynolds shear stress occurs on the south side of the foundation trench at maximum ebbing in a tidal cycle. The numerical calculation method shows a strong performance in simulation of the hydrodynamic characteristics of tidal currents in the foundation trench, providing a basis for submarine engineering construction in coastal areas...|$|R
