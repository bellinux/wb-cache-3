Binary PSP systems are used in low-speed wind tunnel environments where pressure gradients are small and error sources are more significant. Model shift between reference condition and loaded condition, variation in paint thickness, lamp instability, and temperature are significant sources of error in PSP data. Binary PSP mitigates many of these error sources by employing a second probe into the paint layer, known as the <b>reference</b> <b>probe.</b> This <b>reference</b> <b>probe</b> is used to ratio out {{the effects of these}} errors producing high quality PSP pressure maps at low speeds.|$|E

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the methods of gene dosage based on either RFLP studies or Southern blots using specific and <b>reference</b> <b>probes,</b> we designed a “slot blot” method for the evaluation of the copy number of unique chromosome 21 sequences. Varying amounts of denatured DNA from a normal control, a trisomy 21 patient, and the subject to be analyzed were loaded on the same membrane. Successive hybridizations with <b>reference</b> <b>probes</b> and chromosome 21 probes were then carried out. Intensities of the signals on autoradiograms were quantified by densitometric scanning. Graphic and statistical analysis of the linear regressions between reference and chromosome 21 probe signals were performed, and the conclusion that the DNA from the studied subject had two or three copies for a given chromosome 21 sequence was assessed by statistical comparison of the slopes. As a test for the validation of this method, 10 coded blood DNAs from five normal controls and from five trisomy 21 patients were analyzed, by using two reference (COL 1 A 1 and COL 1 A 2) and two chromosome 21 (D 21 S 11 and D 21 S 17) probes. Among the 10 DNAs analyzed, it was possible to diagnose, with 100 % accuracy, normal controls and trisomic 21 individuals.

Features that contributed to an optimal assay included the use of two different <b>reference</b> <b>probes</b> for the pncA gene targets from wild-type M. tuberculosis and wild-type M. bovis, optimization of the column temperature, increasing the starting concentration of the elution buffer, and reducing the rate of elution buffer increase (slope). A total of 69 strains were studied, including 48 wild-type M. tuberculosis strains (13 were PZA-resistant strains) and 21 M. bovis strains (8 were BCG strains). In all isolates tested, wild-type M. tuberculosis generated a single-peak pattern when mixed with the M. tuberculosis probe and a double-peak pattern with the M. bovis probe. In contrast, all M. bovis isolates generated a double-peak pattern when mixed with the M. tuberculosis probe and a single-peak pattern with the M. bovis probe. PZA-resistant mutant M. tuberculosis isolates generated characteristic patterns that were easily distinguishable from both wild-type M. tuberculosis and M. bovis isolates. Chromatographic patterns generated by the two <b>reference</b> <b>probes</b> allowed the rapid detection of PZA resistance with the simultaneous ability to distinguish between M. tuberculosis and M. bovis.

While quite sensitive, this array has a very wide span for its depth of investigation, leading to problems with horizontal resolution. A number of experimental arrays attempted to overcome the shortcomings of the Wenner array, The most successful of these being the twin-probe array, which has become the standard for archaeological use. The twin-probe array - despite its name - has four probes: one current and one voltage probe mounted on a mobile frame to collect survey readings, and the other current probe placed remotely along with a voltage <b>reference</b> <b>probe.</b> These fixed remote probes {{are connected to the}} mobile survey probes by a trailing cable.

Within these frequency ranges the analytically determined resonance frequencies in this mansuscript are larger than that from the simulations. This is caused by a metallic adapter ring, which serves as planar impedance matching in the pMRP design. First simulations show, that a decrease of the inner radius of this ring shifts the resonances to larger frequencies, which leads to a better agreement with the analytic model.|$|R

In the Osteoprobe II™, the probe assembly, {{which is designed to}} penetrate soft tissue, consists of a <b>reference</b> <b>probe</b> (a 22 gauge hypodermic needle) and a test probe (a small diameter, sharpened rod) which slides through the inside of the <b>reference</b> <b>probe.</b> The probe assembly is inserted through the skin to rest on the bone.

However, it must be emphasized that, at this time, neither the IDI nor any other mechanical measurement by any technique has been shown clinically to correlate with fracture risk. Further, we do not yet understand the mechanism responsible for determining IDI beyond noting that it {{is a measure of the}} continuing damage that results from repeated loading.

40|$|Abstract Background The Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) {{is widely}} used for {{analysis}} of copy number variations (CNVs) in single or multiple loci. MLPA is a versatile methodology and important tool in cancer research; it provides precise information on increased or decreased copy number at specific loci as opposed to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies based upon microsatellite analysis. Pre-designed MLPA kits and software are commercially available to analyze multiple exons, genes, and genomic regions. However, an increasing demand for new gene specific assays makes it necessary to self-design new MLPA probes for which the available software may not be applicable. During evaluation of new self-designed <b>reference</b> <b>probes,</b> we encountered a number of problems, especially when applying the MLPA methodology to tumor samples. Findings DNA samples from 48 unaffected individuals and 145 breast cancer patients were used to evaluate 11 self-designed MLPA probes and determine the cut-off values for CNV, before applying the MLPA probes to normalize the target probes in a cohort of affected individuals. To test the calculation strategy, three probes were designed to cover regions in Regulator of G-protein Signaling 8 (RGS 8), which we previously have identified as being affected by allelic imbalance by LOH analysis across RGS 8 in the cohort comprising 145 breast tumors. Agreement between the LOH results and the results obtained by {{each of the three}} MLPA probes in RGS 8 was found for 64 %, 73 %, and 91 %, of the analyzed samples, respectively. Conclusion Here, we present a straightforward method, based upon the normalization pattern in both unaffected and affected individuals, to evaluate self-designed <b>reference</b> <b>probes</b> and to calculate CNV for the MLPA assay with specific focus on the difficulties when analyzing tumor DNA. </p...|$|R

40|$|Data {{normalization}} is {{a crucial}} preliminary step in analyzing genomic datasets. The goal of normalization is to remove global variation to make readings across different experiments comparable. In addition, most genomic loci have non-uniform sensitivity to any given assay because of variation in local sequence properties. In microarray experiments, this non-uniform sensitivity is due to different DNA hybridization and cross-hybridization efficiencies, known as the probe effect. In this paper we introduce a new scheme, called Group Normalization (GN), to remove both global and local biases in one integrated step, whereby we determine the normalized probe signal by finding a set of <b>reference</b> <b>probes</b> with similar responses. Compared to conventional normalization methods such as Quantile normalization and physically motivated probe effect models, our proposed method is general {{in the sense that}} it does not require the assumption that the underlying signal distribution be identical for the treatment and control, and is flexible enough to correct for nonlinear and higher order probe effects.
