25|$|After {{experimenting with}} {{additive}} systems (including a camera with two apertures, {{one with a}} <b>red</b> <b>filter,</b> one with a green filter) from 1915 to 1921, Dr. Herbert Kalmus, Dr. Daniel Comstock, and mechanic W. Burton Wescott developed a subtractive color system for Technicolor. The system used a beam splitter in a specially modified camera to send red and green light to adjacent frames of one strip of black-and-white film. From this negative, skip-printing was used to print each color's frames contiguously onto film stock with half the normal base thickness. The two prints were chemically toned to roughly complementary hues of red and green, then cemented together, back to back, into a single strip of film. The first film to use this process was Toll of the Sea (1922) starring Anna May Wong. Perhaps the most ambitious film to use it was The Black Pirate (1926), starring and produced by Douglas Fairbanks.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} color {{photography}} used by Prokudin-Gorsky was first suggested by James Clerk Maxwell in 1855 and demonstrated in 1861, but good results were not {{possible with the}} photographic materials available at that time. In imitation of the way a normal human eye senses color, the visible spectrum of colors was divided into three channels of information by capturing it {{in the form of}} three black-and-white photographs, one taken through a <b>red</b> <b>filter,</b> one through a green filter, and one through a blue filter. The resulting three photographs could either be projected through filters of the same colors and exactly superimposed on a screen, synthesizing the original range of color additively; viewed as an additive color image by {{one person at a time}} through an optical device known generically as a chromoscope or photochromoscope, which contained colored filters and transparent reflectors that visually combined the three into one full-color image; or used to make photographic or mechanical prints in the complementary colors cyan, magenta and yellow, which, when superimposed, reconstituted the color subtractively.|$|E

500|$|During an 1861 Royal Institution {{lecture on}} colour theory, Maxwell {{presented}} the world's first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. Thomas Sutton, {{inventor of the}} single-lens reflex camera, took the picture. He photographed a tartan ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter, which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's photographic plates were [...] insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, {{the results of this}} pioneering experiment were far from perfect. It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that [...] "if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue," [...] it [...] "would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved." [...] Researchers in 1961 concluded that the seemingly impossible partial success of the red-filtered exposure was due to ultraviolet light, which is strongly reflected by some red dyes, not entirely blocked by the <b>red</b> <b>filter</b> used, and within the range of sensitivity of the wet collodion process Sutton employed.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{testing a}} sample, the Spectronic 20 is {{calibrated}} using a blank solution, {{which is the}} pure solvent that {{is used in the}} experimental sample. [...] It is typically water or an organic solvent. [...] In this calibration, the transmittance is set at 100% using the calibration knob of the instrument (the amplifier control knob in the figure at right). The instrument can also optionally be calibrated with a stock solution of a sample at a concentration known to have an absorbance of 2 or else vendor supplied standards, using the light absorption knob in the diagram shown at right. After calibration, the user places a 1/2 inch test tube or cuvette containing the sample solution to be measured into the sample compartment. Calibration is repeated each time the wavelength is changed. It or a standard reference sample is generally used to periodically check for drift. To measure wavelengths above 650 nm, the bottom of the instrument is opened, and a <b>red</b> <b>filter</b> and a red-sensitive photocell is installed.|$|E

50|$|If the {{photographer}} has an advanced understanding, they may use different colors {{in areas of}} an image to create contrast differences selectively when printing their negatives, similar to using colored filters on black and white film. It is, in effect, using a <b>red</b> <b>filter</b> only on the sky, and perhaps a green filter on just the grass, all at once (for example: the <b>red</b> <b>filter</b> would darken {{the sky and the}} green filter would lighten the grass).

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole. The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, spectral class A stars. The A stars are not evident in <b>redder</b> <b>filters,</b> but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.|$|R

5000|$|In the theatres, most {{scenes were}} black and white, but scenes {{involving}} ghosts were {{shown in a}} [...] "process" [...] dubbed Illusion-O: the filmed elements of the actors and the sets â everything except the ghosts â had a blue filter applied to the footage, while the ghost elements had a <b>red</b> <b>filter</b> and were superimposed over the frame. Audiences received viewers with red and blue cellophane filters. Unlike early 3D glasses where one eye is red {{and the other is}} cyan or blue, the Illusion-O viewer required people to look through a single color with both eyes. Choosing to look through the <b>red</b> <b>filter</b> intensified the images of the ghosts, while the blue filter [...] "removed" [...] them. Despite Castle's claims to the contrary, not many heart failures or nervous breakdowns were averted by the Illusion-O process; although the blue filter did screen out the ghostly images, the ghosts were visible with the naked eye, without the <b>red</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this {{contribution}} {{we study}} integrated properties of dynamically segregated star clusters. The observed core radii of segregated clusters can be 50 % {{smaller than the}} âtrue â core radius. In addition, the measured radius in the <b>red</b> <b>filters</b> is smaller than those measured in blue filters. However, these difference are small (ï¿½ 10 %), making it observationally challenging to detect mass segregation in extra-galactic clusters based on such a comparison. Our results follow naturally {{from the fact that}} in nearly all filters most of the light comes from the most massive stars. Therefore, the observed surface brightness profile is dominated by stars of similar mass, which are centrally concentrated and have a similar spatial distribution...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} and employed a new method {{for determining the}} redshift of galaxies between the range of 2000 cz to 10, 000 cz. The method involved getting a transmission through sloped blue and <b>red</b> <b>filters,</b> along with a continuum filter. The Moody-Holden-McNeff Relation is detailed, giving {{the relationship between the}} transmissions through the filters and the estimated redshift. The data that was collected for 5 nights is outlined along with the 3 different methods of analysis. Despite the fact that the data was cloudy and often had low signal to noise, there is good evidence that the method worked and deserves follow up research. The next step will be to ensure the data is taken on photometric nights. ...|$|R
