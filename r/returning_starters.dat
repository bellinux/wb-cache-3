In their tenth game, Alabama was upset by Texas A, and dropped to the number four position in the rankings.

25|$|In 2004, USC {{was picked}} preseason #1 by the Associated Press, {{thanks to the}} return of Leinart as well as sophomore running backs LenDale White and Reggie Bush. The defense—led by All-American {{defensive}} tackles Shaun Cody and Mike Patterson, as well as All-American linebackers Lofa Tatupu and Matt Grootegoed—was considered {{to be among the}} finest in the nation. Key questions included the offensive line, with few <b>returning</b> <b>starters,</b> and the receiving corps, which had lost previous year's senior Keary Colbert and the breakout star of 2003, Mike Williams. Williams had tried to enter the NFL draft a year early during the Maurice Clarett trial when it was ruled that the NFL could not deny them entering the draft. The decision was appealed and overturned leaving Williams unable to enter the draft. When he applied to the NCAA for reinstatement of his eligibility, it was denied.|$|E
25|$|Sports Illustrateds Stewart Mandel has Tech ranked at #10 in his preseason {{poll and}} later #8 in his college {{football}} power rankings.

ESPN.com writer Mark Schlabach ranked the Red Raiders #12 in his preseason poll and later #11 and #8 in revised editions of his preseason polls. In a March 26, 2008 article, Yahoo! Sports writer Olin Buchanan declared that Tech could challenge Oklahoma and Texas for supremacy in the Big 12 South in 2008. As plusses, he cited a strong quarterback (Graham Harrell), experienced wide receivers (including Michael Crabtree), and five <b>returning</b> <b>starters</b> on the offensive line. As a weakness, he mentioned the defense's trouble stopping the run but speculated that a year of experience and new talent may help to alleviate this problem. Another weak spot he pointed out was the Red Raiders' trouble moving {{the ball on the}} ground on those rare instances when a rushing play is called.|$|E

25|$|On November 28, 2011, Ohio State {{announced}} that Urban Meyer {{was hired as}} head coach. Despite the program being on probation for NCAA violations and prohibited from appearing in a bowl for the 2012 season, the Buckeyes overcame a rash of injuries on defense in a season reminiscent of 2002 and completed a perfect 12–0 season with a victory over Michigan on November 24, 26–21. In {{one of the most}} incredible performances in college football history, Ohio State won the first ever College Football Playoff, with its third-string quarterback, Cardale Jones, after the starter and second-string quarterback were out to injury. Jones had never started in a college game. His first 3 starts were in the B1G Championship Game, the Sugar Bowl, and the National Championship Game. He went 3-0 to win the national championship. Many credit Urban Meyer with this being the best coaching job in college football history.. The next season brought with it expectations of a repeat championship as Ohio State returned many of its starters from the previous year. Ohio State would go on to compile a 13-1 record, with a crucial loss to Michigan State keeping them out of the College Football Playoff. In 2016, in spite of having the fewest <b>returning</b> <b>starters</b> of any team in the country, Ohio State would go on to win 11 games, but ultimately losing to Penn State in the regular season and Clemson in a crushing 31-0 defeat in the College Football Playoff Semifinal.|$|E

In their twelfth game, Alabama was upset by Auburn. The loss, in a game since the [...] "Kick Six," [...] kept the Crimson Tide out of the SEC Championship Game. Although they did not qualify to play for their third consecutive national championship with a final BCS ranking of third, Alabama did accept an invitation to play in the Sugar Bowl.

500|$|Graham, who {{had been}} troubled by {{conditioning}} issues the prior season arrived at spring practice in very good shape, which pleased newly arrived head coach Rich Rodriguez, who was welcomed by a defensive line composed entirely of <b>returning</b> <b>starters,</b> including Graham.
