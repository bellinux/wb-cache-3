5|$|General {{relativity}} can {{be understood}} by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The first step is the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is relatively}} common, resulting {{in more than}} 20,000 emergency room visits {{a year in the}} United States. It is {{the most common type of}} fatal poisoning in many countries. In the United States non-fire related cases results in more than 400 deaths a year. Poisonings occur more often in the winter, particularly from the use of portable generators during power outages. The toxic effects of CO have been known since ancient history. The <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Kansas, Beilhart obsessively {{investigated}} a variety of beliefs, including Christian Science, Divine Science, Spiritualism, and Theosophy. He found, however, {{that none of these}} religions held his interest. In time, he came to the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> he would not adhere to any one denomination, but develop a faith of his own by combining aspects of several different religions.|$|E

While in attendance at a New York Knicks game, Jack asks more about the woman Danny is seeing and Danny reveals details, such as she has never let a man see her feet. This results in Jack's <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> the woman is the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), and he is displeased.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this presentation, {{we review}} an {{alternative}} technique called splitting, which accelerates {{the rate of}} occurrence of the rare events of interest. Here, we do not change the probability laws driving the model. Instead, we use a selection mechanism to favour the trajectories deemed {{likely to lead to}} those rare events. The main idea is to decompose the paths to the rare events of interest into shorter subpaths whose probability is not so small, encourage the <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> take these subpaths (leading to the event of interest) by giving them a chance to reproduce (a bit like in selective evolution), and discourage the <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> go in the wrong direction by killing them with some positive probability...|$|R

5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements {{led to the}} <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> our Solar System {{is located}} in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the Universe. It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, {{observations}} {{in the microwave}} part of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum (0.1–10GHz) led {{to the discovery of}} the Jovian decimetric radiation (DIM) and the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> it was synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons trapped in the planet's radiation belts. These synchrotron emissions were used to estimate the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates of the magnetic moment and its tilt.|$|E

Kennedy campaigned hard for Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale and defended vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro from criticism over being a pro-choice Catholic, but Reagan was re-elected in a landslide.|$|E
5|$|The {{last three}} decades have seen a {{proliferation}} of subfamily names, {{as a result of}} three factors: (1) the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> some subfamilies were assemblages of unrelated taxa; (2) abandonment of paraphyletic taxa, and (3) the discovery of novel fossil taxa. Seventeen extant subfamilies of ants are currently recognized, along with four extinct subfamilies. One of the fossil taxa, Armaniinae, is often given family rank within the superfamily Formicoidea. About 13 genera are incertae sedis (of uncertain placement), and are not assigned to any subfamily.|$|E

5|$|Villagers {{gathered}} around the burning windmill cheer the apparent death of the Monster (Boris Karloff). Their joy is tempered by the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is also apparently dead. Hans (Reginald Barlow), father of the girl the creature drowned in the previous film, {{wants to see the}} Monster's bones. He falls into a flooded pit underneath the mill, where the Monster– having survived the fire– strangles him. Hauling himself from the pit, the Monster casts Hans' wife (Mary Gordon) to her death. He next encounters Minnie (Una O'Connor), who flees in terror.|$|E
5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> the National Park Service {{does not represent}} the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Cady, Stanton's father, was a {{prominent}} Federalist attorney who served one term in the United States Congress (1814–1817) and then became both a circuit court judge and, in 1847, a New York Supreme Court justice. Judge Cady introduced his daughter to the law and, together with her brother-in-law, Edward Bayard, planted the early seeds that grew into her legal and social activism. Even as a young girl, she enjoyed reading her father's law books and debating legal issues with his law clerks. It was this early exposure to law that, in part, caused Stanton to realize how disproportionately the law favored men over women, particularly married women. Her <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> married women had virtually no property, income, employment, or even custody rights over their own children, helped set her course toward changing these inequities.|$|E

Eight of them, referred to as 'Owners', visit this O-Zone as their personal playground.

40|$|A {{design pattern}} {{realization}} {{consists of a}} cluster of classes that work together to solve a particular problem using a well known, named solution. Developers may build systems out of several pattern realizations, and these pattern realizations may be interconnected, or, in other words, coupled. Coupled pattern realizations may represent a reasonable solution to software design problems, however the coupling can introduce dependencies that increase faultproneness and lower adaptability. We identify mechanisms that can couple pattern realizations, and evaluate the relative tightness of the connections. An examination of pattern coupling in five systems provides initial evidence that pattern coupling is common. In addition, we find initial evidence that classes in pattern <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> are coupled via associations are (1) more change prone and (2) exhibit higher change coupling — classes that are modified together in response to one required change — than those in pattern <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> are coupled by other mechanism...|$|R

He tells her that Trill customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their {{symbionts}} would never be joined with a new host, but that she will have his support either way. Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, but it goes wrong and Defiant is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a force field across a plasma fire that allows her to reach Kahn, coming to the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> the relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|Finally, on 30 October, the new long-planned {{offensive}} began, {{and after}} two days a Soviet regiment was encircled. Finnish General Hjalmar Siilasvuo proceeded to clear the perimeter with his troops. After the disappointing performance of the SS units under his command and the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> he neither the Finnish nor the German high command is going to provide him with additional forces or substantial reinforcements, he slowed down the advance towards the east and instead concentrated on clearing and securing the area. Those mop-up operations were completed by 13 November. By that point the Finnish 3rd Division had killed 3,000 Soviet soldiers and captured 2,600.|$|E
5|$|For a while, he was {{uncertain}} {{whether he would}} attend college, but ultimately he applied and was accepted to Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia, where a friend had also enrolled. Arriving in 1982, he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy. He found the curriculum rigorous, but was more focused {{than he had been}} in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden–Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred in 1984 to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance, emboldened by the <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows. He graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 1986.|$|E

40|$|The classic {{literature}} provides characterizations for {{the existence}} of such <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> are strongly related to the concept of majorization. Aigner and Triesch (1994) extended this approach to a more general result for graphs, leading to an efficient realization algorithm and a short and simple proof for the Erdős-Gallai Theorem. We extend this approach to the bipartite realization problem and the digraph realization problem.|$|R
