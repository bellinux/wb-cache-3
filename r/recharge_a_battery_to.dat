40|$|Abstract—A {{platform}} to study ultrasound {{as a source}} for wireless energy transfer and communication for implanted medical devices is described. A tank is used as a container for a pair of electroacoustic transducers, where a control unit is fixed to one wall of the tank and a transponder can be manually moved in three axes and rotate using a mechanical system. The tank is filled with water to allow acoustic energy and data transfer, and the system is optimized to avoid parasitic effects due to cables, reflection paths and cross talk problems. A printed circuit board is developed to test energy scavenging such that enough acoustic intensity is generated by the control unit <b>to</b> <b>recharge</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> loaded <b>to</b> the transponder. In the same manner, a second printed circuit board is fabricated to study transmission of information through acoustic waves.

50|$|Ongoing {{technological}} advances in rechargeable batteries and battery chargers, means most single-use alkaline batteries can largely {{be replaced with}} higher capacity, environmentally preferable, rechargeable Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries. Rechargeable batteries will outperform the best alkaline single-use batteries in high-drain appliances such as digital cameras. Rechargeable batteries may not {{last as long as}} alkaline <b>batteries</b> on <b>a</b> single charge in low drain (e.g. radio), medium drain (e.g. MD player), and pulse drain devices (e.g. photoflash); but NiMH batteries can be reused over several hundred times while alkaline batteries can be used only once. NiMH rechargeable batteries do not have what is commonly referred to as 'memory effect' so they can be recharged at any time. The main environmental concerns of batteries are the harmful materials they contain, such as Mercury (Hg), Cadmium (Cd) and Lead (Pb). Batteries containing these materials need to be carefully disposed of to avoid the harmful effects on human health and environment. Canadians buy over 150 million batteries per year. It takes less energy <b>to</b> <b>recharge</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> than <b>to</b> produce <b>a</b> new one. Using metal recovered from batteries consumes 75 percent less energy and 46 percent less energy than extracting it from primary sources.|$|R
40|$|The {{trends in}} {{technology}} allow {{the decrease in}} both size and power consumption of complex digital systems. This decrease in size and power gives rise to new paradigms of computing and use of electronics, with many small devices working collaboratively or at least with strong communication capabilities. Examples of these new paradigms are wearable devices and wireless sensor networks. Currently, these devices are powered by batteries. However, batteries present several disadvantages: the need to either replace or recharge them periodically and their big size and weight compared to high technology electronics. One possibility to overcome these power limitations is to extract (harvest) energy from the environment <b>to</b> either <b>recharge</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery,</b> or even <b>to</b> directly power the electronic device. This paper presents several methods to design an energy harvesting device {{depending on the type}} of energy available. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{unmanned}} air vehicles are gaining {{more and more}} interest and popularity in particular miniaturized small flight objects named NAVs (Nano Air Vehicles). One of the main considerations when building or buying a drone is the flight time and range. The flight time is nowadays a drawback for miniature unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It is limited to few minutes before requiring a forced recovery <b>to</b> replace exhausted <b>batteries.</b> Currently the batteries are the dominant technology, which possess limited operation in time and energy. The real viability to extending flight time (FT) of NAVs is possible exploring new and more disruptive alternative solution able either <b>to</b> <b>recharge</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery,</b> or even <b>to</b> directly power the NAVs during the flight. Plasmonic Nano Energy harvester is an attractive technology to extending the FT extracting the energy in mid-infrared radiation emitted from Earth’s surface with Rectenna tuned to mid-infrared wavelengths (7 – 14) um with a peak wavelength of about 10 um.

40|$|At Risø DTU a Toyota Prius {{has been}} {{equipped}} with <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> {{that gives the}} car a range of approximately 50 km on electricity only and thereby been converted from a hybrid electrical vehicle, HEV, to a plug-in hybrid electrical vehicle, PHEV. Changes in supply and demand on the wholesale power market {{are reflected in the}} electricity price level and if PHEV users select to charge in periods of lower price it will affect their total cost of charging and by that the cost per driven kilometre. This report investigates the effect of a few different charging strategies on the charging cost to a user that faces variable electricity prices. The traditional way of <b>recharging</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> is <b>to</b> plug it in and to switch on the charger immediately and then to dissconnect the charger when the battery is fully charged. This scenario will be used as a reference in terms of charging cost. For scheduled charging under a time period between plug-in and unplugging of the vehicle to the grid the electricity prices during different time steps of this period must be either known or forecast. Focus in this report is on the characteristics of the components involved in a system for automated vehicle charging and potential approaches to the charging strategy. The numerical findings suffer from a simple and non-adaptive forecast model and anomalous behaviour of an optimisation function. It can however be seen that the more elaborate optimisation models that could be calculated did produce a lower charging cost than their more simple counterparts. ii Acknowledgements Most of all want to thank my supervisor Niels Kjølstad Poulsen at the Depart-ment of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling at the Technical University o...|$|R

50|$|Lead-acid {{batteries}} {{lose the}} ability to accept a charge when discharged for too long due to sulfation, the crystallization of lead sulfate. They generate electricity through a double sulfate chemical reaction. Lead and lead dioxide, the active materials on the battery's plates, react with sulfuric acid in the electrolyte to form lead sulfate. The lead sulfate first forms in a finely divided, amorphous state, and easily reverts to lead, lead dioxide and sulfuric acid when the <b>battery</b> <b>recharges.</b> <b>As</b> <b>batteries</b> cycle through numerous discharges and charges, some lead sulfate is not recombined into electrolyte and slowly converts to a stable crystalline form that no longer dissolves on recharging.

Moreover, in order to reduce manpower, a PC-based remote electrical monitoring technique used in the battery’s recharged system will be established via a TCP/IP network. Consequently, a PV solar panel with a 30 Watt capacity used to generate electricity using a PC-based monitoring system is exemplified. ...|$|R
