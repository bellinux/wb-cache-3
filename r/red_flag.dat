About 5,200 sorties were flown, representing over 9,500 flying hours. <b>Red</b> <b>Flag</b> exercises at Wendover were discontinued after 1986.

40|$|Purpose – Aims to {{determine}} whether <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> can be helpful for external auditors in detecting fraudulent financial reporting. The research explores whether external auditors demographic factors affect external auditors’ perception {{about the ability of}} <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> to detect fraudulent financial reporting in Egypt. Design/methodology/approach – Data was collected using a questionnaire that was pretested by a pilot study. A questionnaire was then distributed to a sample of 100 external auditors working in different audit firms in Egypt and having different years of experience. The sample of external auditors was randomly selected. Findings – According to external auditors’ opinion, <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> are helpful in detecting fraud. Our research didn’t support the effect of external auditors’ experience and type of audit office on auditors’ perception about <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> ability to detect fraudulent financial reporting. Research Limitations – two external auditors from the big 4 international audit firms filled in the questionnaire, thus our results can’t be generalized to all audit firms in Egypt. There can also be other <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> in the literature that aren’t mentioned in the research study. Originality/value - Our research included a list of specific <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> for fraudulent financial reporting that were highly accepted by the sample of external auditors in our study. These specific <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> can be used in conjunction with SAS 99 <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> to enhance external auditors’ ability in detecting fraudulent financial reporting. The research also ranked all <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> for fraudulent financial reporting according to their relative importance based on external auditor opinion which can help auditors to focus their efforts more on high quality <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> during brainstorming sessions which will in turn facilitate fraud detection. Future research should be more directed toward listing other <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> for fraudulent financial reporting in the literature and should test them using other methods like experiments or interviews. The list of <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> presented in our research can for a good base for future researchers...|$|R
40|$|Red flags"are {{indicators}} of potential issues regarding governance failure, collusion or corruption in projects. While some specific <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> can be powerful {{indicators of}} {{issues to be}} addressed, the hypothesis {{of this paper is}} that many proposed <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> are potentially too ubiquitous and randomly distributed to be useful as indicators of significant governance failure. The paper examines project documentation from a small sample of World Bank water and sanitation projects in an attempt to collect data on {{the presence or absence of}} 13 commonly accepted <b>red</b> <b>flags.</b> This paper finds that: (i) almost every contract reviewed raised at least one of 13 <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> analyzed; (ii) potentially tainted contracts did not exhibit notably more <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> than control contracts; and (iii) the occurrence of multiple <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> in the same contract was rare enough to suggest that joint occurrence was largely by chance, not as a result of a strongly causal inter-relationship between flags. The ubiquity and apparent randomness of these <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> suggests that their roll-out as a monitoring tool requires additional thought as to interpretation, context and use. The paper examines an alternate tool for uncovering potential problem projects [...] supplier concentration. Across a very small sample, there does appear to be a relationship between such concentration and potential problem projects.

A total of 50 physiotherapists in Kano State were involved in the study. A modified version of a questionnaire from the Royal College of General Practitioners (1999) was used as a tool for data collection. Data retrieved were analysed using descriptive statistics of frequency and percentage. The majority of the physiotherapists 44 (88 %) had knowledge of <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> but only 14 (28 %) were putting it to good use. A few <b>red</b> <b>flags,</b> such as age of the patient 9 (18 %), and history of trauma 8 (12 %), were more often documented, while medical history of cancer, HIV status, as well as history of fever were the least documented and by only 1 (2 %) physiotherapist.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} international {{concern about the}} escalation of fraud and, in particular, financial statement fraud. Detecting financial statement fraud and proving such fraud remains an elusive goal. Red flagging is an early warning system {{that has been used}} by auditors to determine the probability of financial statement fraud. The purpose of this research project was to survey investors and lenders in South Africa on their use of <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> and to obtain their opinions on the relative importance of individual <b>red</b> <b>flags.</b> A questionnaire was sent to banks that are registered with the Registrar of Banks (representative of lenders) and to portfolio managers registered with the Financial Services Board (representative of investors).

After the <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> was lifted, only twelve minutes of the session remained and all drivers took to the track to try out the super-soft compound. This did not last long however, as Jenson Button had to park his car at turn seven, reporting a problem with his power unit.

Turvey impacted the chicane's barrier with Adam Carroll and Bird spinning their cars in the fifth turn. Loïc Duval's left-front tyre lost a wheel nut, causing it to become detached and the session was red flagged. As {{a result of the}} <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> to retrieve Duval's tire and the two stoppages seen in the first practice session, the second 45-minute practice period was extended by five minutes. Shortly after the session restarted, Engel stopped at the turn one exit with car problems but a second <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> was not required because he was off the track.

Max Verstappen was the last to set a representative time, but touched the guardrail at the swimming pool chicane and crashed into the wall, causing another <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> period. As the session got back under way, it were the two Manor cars of Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein, as well as Jolyon Palmer and Marcus Ericsson who joined Nasr and Verstappen on the sidelines, as they were eliminated.

In addition, when pressure to meet a financial target is high, managers are more concerned about earnings quality when <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> are present. We also document that when <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> are present, managers are more likely to report both internally to their CEO and, if their concerns are not resolved internally, externally to their auditor. Pressure to meet a financial target directly influenced the decision to report internally, but not externally. Additional analyses contemplate the countervailing personal costs associated with reporting or not reporting earnings quality concerns. We demonstrate the important role short-term costs play in external reporting decisions. Finally, we provide initial evidence that corporate managers with a longer tenure at their position (public accounting background) are less (more) likely to report externally...|$|R
