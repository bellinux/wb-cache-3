The Ohio Bureau of Labor Market Information predicts that, from 2004 to 2014, {{there will be}} 11,200 less workers in Ohio's industry.

5|$|When World War II started, tonnage {{levels at}} the port {{decreased}} and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic <b>rubber</b> <b>products</b> by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.|$|E

40|$|The graft {{copolymerization}} of methyl methacrylate and styrene onto natural rubber in the emulsion process {{was carried out}} by varying the concentrations of methyl methacrylate and styrene monomers, emulsifier concentration, initiator concentration, and reaction temperature. The grafting efficiency, graft ratio, and monomer conversion were reported.

The copolymer composition was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and elemental analysis (CHO). The optimum condition of {{graft copolymerization}} was found to be at 100 parts by weight of monomer per 100 parts by weight of natural rubber latex, 1. 5 parts by weight of emulsifier, 1. 5 parts by weight of initiator and at a temperature of 70 °C for 8 hours.

25|$|Nearly all {{chemical}} reactions can occur at normal temperatures (although different reactions proceed at different rates). However most reactions are accelerated by high temperatures, and {{the degradation of}} foods and pharmaceuticals is no exception. The same applies to the breakdown of many chemical explosives into more unstable compounds. Nitroglycerine is notorious. Old explosives are thus more dangerous (i.e. liable to be triggered to explode by very small disturbances, even trivial jiggling) than more recently manufactured explosives. <b>Rubber</b> <b>products</b> also degrade as sulphur bonds induced during vulcanization revert; this is why old rubber bands and other <b>rubber</b> <b>products</b> soften and get crispy, and lose their elasticity as they age.|$|E

25|$|Ozone gas attacks any polymer {{possessing}} olefinic or double bonds {{within its}} chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene <b>rubber.</b> <b>Products</b> made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, {{the rate of}} crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking {{used to be a}} serious problem in car tires for example, but the problem is now seen only in very old tires.
