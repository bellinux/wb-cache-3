25|$|By 1962, the Magic Mile {{had long}} been a {{challenge}} to maintain, so the Timberline's operator {{replaced it with a}} double <b>Riblet</b> lift. The new lift had a midway station for loading and unloading, which allowed the lower mountain to remain open when harsh winter weather closed the upper mountain, and the upper mountain to remain open for mid-to-late summer skiing when little snow remained on the lower mountain.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 1915, Bob Ashley {{attempted}} {{to break his}} brother John out of jail. Entering the jailer's house, Bob Ashley shot Deputy Sheriff Wilber W. Hendrickson at point-blank range and left with his jail keys. He then ran from {{the house to the}} garage where gang members had left him a getaway car. When he found he was unable to drive the particular car left for him, he {{attempted to}} force several men at gunpoint to drive the car for him. Each of the men claimed to not know how to drive the car either so Bob Ashley jumped on the running board of a passing truck and forced the driver, T.H. Duckett, to take him out of town. A deputy, officer J.R. <b>Riblet,</b> spotted Ashley and gave chase. When the truck suddenly stalled {{in the middle of the}} street, a shootout occurred resulting in the deaths of both Bob Ashley and <b>Riblet.</b> Angered by Bob's killing spree, several thousand Miami residents threatened the jailhouse and talked of lynching John Ashley in his cell. It was only after police paraded the body of Bob Ashley though the streets that the mob dispersed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{review of}} <b>riblets</b> as a smart flow control device is given. After the {{state-of-the-art}} {{examination of the}} drag reduction performance, different views on the drag reduction mechanism are put in perspective. Being a smart flow control device, <b>riblets</b> can control not only momentum, but also heat and flow noise. Some of the available results are summarized to encourage the readers to consider other applications of <b>riblets.</b> Although useful for research investigations, <b>riblets</b> films are not industrially friendly. Here, recent efforts in manufacturing the micro-groove surface in situ are reviewed, including an overview of patents relating {{to the production of}} <b>riblets...</b>|$|R

The <b>riblets</b> are more crowded on {{the centre of}} the whorl. There are 20 on the last whorl and 10 on the antepenultimate whorl. Faint growth-striae cross <b>riblets</b> and grooves obliquely. The aperture is round, bevelled at the edge, and thickened within but not externally.|$|R
40|$|Direct {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} spatially developing turbulent boundary layers over <b>riblets</b> are {{conducted to examine}} the effects of <b>riblets</b> on skin friction at supersonic speeds. Zero-pressure gradient boundary layers with an adiabatic wall, a Mach number of M 1 = 2. 5, and a Reynolds number based on momentum thickness of Re = 1720 are considered. Simulations are conducted for boundary-layer flows over a clean surface and symmetric V- groove <b>riblets</b> with nominal spacings of 20 and 40 wall units. The DNS results confirm the few existing experimental observations and show that a drag reduction of approximately 7 % is achieved for <b>riblets</b> with proper spacing. The influence of <b>riblets</b> on turbulence statistics is analyzed in detail with an emphasis on identifying the differences, if any, between the drag reduction mechanisms for incompressible and high-speed boundary layers...|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the {{original}} Magic Mile began in mid-1938, {{a few months after}} Timberline Lodge opened for business with a portable rope tow. (The tow [...] remained in operation for at least several years.) The chairlift was the first built by the <b>Riblet</b> company, which drew heavily on its designs for aerial trams for mining companies.|$|E
2500|$|The Magic Mile is {{an aerial}} {{chairlift}} at Timberline Lodge ski area, Mount Hood, Oregon, U.S. [...] It {{was named for}} its unique location above the tree line and for its original length. [...] When constructed by Byron <b>Riblet</b> in 1938, it was the longest chairlift in existence, the second {{in the world to}} be built as a passenger chairlift, and the first to use metal towers.|$|E
50|$|In 1896, <b>Riblet</b> was {{contracted}} {{to erect a}} Finlayson ore tramway at the Noble Five silver mine in Sandon, British Columbia, to assist in moving ore down Reco Mountain to the mill at Cody. Apparently <b>Riblet</b> thought {{he was coming to}} build a streetcar line. Even so, <b>Riblet</b> decided he could improve the mining tram performance. Over time, <b>Riblet</b> raised more aerial tramways in the booming mining district, building 30 in the next decade. <b>Riblet</b> returned to Spokane in 1908, after working in the Kootenays, to found the <b>Riblet</b> Tramway Company. The company, which specialized in mining tramways, built them in Alaska, Canada, the western United States, and South America.|$|E

It is shown that <b>riblets</b> exert a stabilizing effect on transformation of the &# 923;-structure into a turbulent spot. The &# 923;-structure on a smooth surface is shown to stretch in the streamwise direction and transform into a hairpin vortex, which becomes a turbulent spot further downstream. The intensity of the &# 923;-structure on <b>riblets</b> first increases and then decays further downstream, reaching less than half its value on a smooth surface. Finally, the &# 923;-structure decays on <b>riblets</b> without forming a turbulent spot...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the past}} ten years, {{significant}} improvements have been achieved in the laser manufacturing process. It is feasible now to obtain various small-scale surface features (such as dimples, <b>riblets,</b> grooves, etc.) with the current manufacturing readiness level of laser surface texturing techniques. In this paper, the aerodynamic impact of the employment of <b>riblets</b> on turbine endwall has been investigated through combined CFD and experimental studies in a low speed linear cascade environment. Detailed comparisons of the flow structures have been made for cases with and without <b>riblets</b> on the endwall. The results show that endwall <b>riblets</b> can effectively reduce {{the strength of the}} pressure side leg of the horseshoe vortex, lower the cross passage pressure gradient, and alleviate the lift up of the passage vortex. A test section with seven passages and eight blades was used to validate the CFD observations. Both numerical and experimental results indicate that, the addition of <b>riblets</b> can be an effective approach to reduce the endwall secondary flow, and there is a large space for further optimization...|$|R

50|$|<b>Riblets</b> are {{prepared}} by butchers by cutting {{a full set}} of spare ribs approximately in half. This produces a set of short, flat ribs where the curved part of the rib is removed and gives them a more uniform look. Loin back ribs don't always have this removed. When not removed they have a rounded look to them and are often referred to as baby back ribs. Another product (imprecisely) called <b>riblets</b> is actually the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. <b>Riblets</b> used to be thrown out by butchers, but have become popular due to their excellent flavor and lower cost.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLarge Eddy Simulations of zero-pressure-gradient {{turbulent}} boundary layers over <b>riblets</b> {{have been}} conducted. All along the controlled domain, <b>riblets</b> maintain a significant 11 % drag reduction {{with respect to}} the flat plate at the same R e τ (from 250 to 450). To compare the flows above <b>riblets</b> and a reference smooth wall, an appropriate vertical shift between the two surfaces is required. In the present study, the “vertical origin” is set using the identity of Fukagata, Iwamoto and Kasagi (FIK) in Phys. Fluids, vol. 14, 2002, L 73. This identity, which provides a physically meaningful decomposition of the skin friction, has been extended to complex wall surfaces and constitutes the basis for the derivation of a new virtual origin. Using this FIK-based origin, it is shown that the complex interactions between the <b>riblets</b> and the near-wall turbulent structures can be taken into account by a simple shift of the two axes of the mean and turbulent velocity profiles. The appropriate upward shift Δu +, typical for drag reduction, is directly dependent on the skin friction on the <b>riblets</b> and on the reference smooth plate at the same R e τ...|$|R

40|$|THE {{study of}} {{turbulent}} drag reduction {{by use of}} <b>riblets</b> has been an area of significant research during the past de cade. <b>Riblets</b> with symmetric v grooves with adhesive-backed film manufactured the 3 M Company (U. S.) {{have been widely used}} in earlier studies. The effectiveness of <b>riblets</b> in reducing the drag of a simple wo-dimensional configuration is fairly we 11 established now. Although there has been some effort to assess the effectiveness <b>riblets</b> on airfoils, the results reported by Sundaram et al on a NACA 0012 airfoils at low speeds have been particularly noteworthy. 13; Their studies showed that both total and viscous drag reduction increased monotonically with an angle of attack up to 6 deg; it was also shown 3 that the higher drag reduction resulted primarily from airfoil upper (or suction) surface, suggesting increased effectiveness of <b>riblets</b> in adverse pressure gradients. In a subsequent study Subaschandar et al., who extending the work of Sundaram etal to higher angles of attack (by using the same NACA 0012 model 13; and the same wind tunnel), it was observed that the drag reduction decreased rapidly beyond a = 6 deg with virtually no drag reduction a = 12 deg.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the use of systems theory to study the {{stability}} of viscous channel flow. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the flow is modelled as a feedback connection between a linear dynamical subsystem and a memoryless nonlinear subsystem. After discretisation, the system is approximated by a finite-dimensional model and its global stability is analysed using the passivity theorems, which are extended from finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces to finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The passivity analysis leads to the Reynolds number below which the flow is globally stable and the flow can be unstable above this number because of possible energy amplification. The thesis then addresses inaccuracy of the numerical methods that are typically used in the literature to calculate the energy amplification in the flow. It is identified that the inaccuracy is caused by the presence of spurious eigenvalues with negative real parts of large magnitude and numerical integration errors. A remedy to this problem is given in the thesis. In the second part of the thesis, the effects of <b>riblets</b> on the linear stability and the energy amplification in channel flow are investigated numerically. <b>Riblets</b> are small protrusions aligned with the direction of the flow and it is known that the use of <b>riblets</b> on an aerodynamic body can result in significant reduction in drag, although the mechanism of drag reduction by <b>riblets</b> is not yet clear. Three types of <b>riblets</b> (sinusoidal, triangular and semi-circular ones) are considered and in order to use spectral methods to discretise the governing equations, the complex geometry associated with the <b>riblets</b> is transformed to a standard domain by a change of coordinates. The differential equations also have to be transformed into the new coordinate system and the presence of <b>riblets</b> poses a serious difficulty in representing the fluid flow by a state space model. To circumvent this difficulty, a novel formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations is derived. </p...|$|R
