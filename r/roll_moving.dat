40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{commentary}} on the experimental observation observations of Bensimon et al. [1] of convection of a binary fluid mixture in a fluid annulus. They observed a convective pattern that is time periodic, but with non-zero amplitude confined to a stationary sector of the annulus. The symmetry properties of this state are paradoxical. There is no subgroup of the spatio-temporal symmetry group of the experiment that preserves the confined state, but {{different aspects of the}} confined states can be associated with different symmetry subgroups. Solutions to a model partial differential equation are displayed here which are reminiscent of the confined states observed in the experiments of Bensimon et al. The convection experiments that motivate this work were conducted with ethyl alcohol water mixtures in a "thin" annulus. The height and crosssectional width of the annulus were comparable and much smaller than the circumference of the annulus. The states observed at the onset of convection are patterns of approximately fifty rolls that propagate at uniform speed as traveling waves. By first decreasing the Rayleigh number when the fluid {{is in a state of}} uniform traveling waves and increasing it again, Bensimon et al. were able to stabilize a pattern of traveling waves that was confined to a sector of the annulus. In one sector of the annulus, the fluid was conducting while, in the complementary sector, the fluid propagated as a pattern of <b>rolls</b> <b>moving</b> with constant speed from one boundary point of the sector to the other. The symmetry properties of the confined states are puzzling. In particular, the combination of stationary boundaries to the convective sectors with the propagation of rolls within sectors calls for explanation.

To avoid having a single, long magnetic tape, it instead has 64 small rolls of 9 meters each, with 1.6-cm wide tape on each roll, divided into 8 channels per roll. The tape speed is 5 m/s. To read a particular roll, the carousel rotates so the desired roll ends up at the bottom.

40|$|Usually, {{transportation}} of laminated products is done through rolls, {{put in rotation}} by electric motors.

The drawback of this speed limitation is most noticeable on the portions of the steel mill where, according to the work conditions, each metal sheet is to be rapidly stopped or pushed away (cutting zone, etc…).

When a current passed through the filament, the magnetic field created by the current would cause the string to move. A light shining on the string would cast a shadow on a <b>moving</b> <b>roll</b> of photographic paper, thus forming a continuous curve showing {{the movement of the}} string.

Multiphase flow modeling has been performed to understand the particle-surface interactions by coupling the particulate models for solid phase with computational fluid dynamics for fluid phase. A strong fluid flow along the roll axis, which captures {{a significant number of}} dross particles, was found in the 3 D bath simulation.

40|$|In {{the tube}} bending {{industry}} a process is considered flexible if {{it allows the}} forming of different curvature radii, {{without the need for}} a machine setup or a tool change. This is possible by numerically controlling one or more <b>moving</b> dies or <b>rolls</b> which are able to produce different radii. Unlike conventional tube bending processes, where the tube is clamped at its end and bent around a fixed die, bending with variable radius generally requires that the tube is axially fed into the forming area. A flexible bending operation is traditionally operated by dividing it into an opening phase (the bending <b>roll</b> is <b>moving)</b> and a steady phase (the bending roll is on hold and the tube is axially fed). A technological limit of the process is its intrinsic variability, e. g. measured in terms of repeatability of the obtained bent angle. An FEM based sensitivity analysis is shown in the paper in order to verify which input parameters of the incoming tubes (dimensions, material properties, etc.) are more influential on the results in terms of repeatability. The presence of the two opening and steady phases, with different mechanical conditions is an obstacle to the production of an aesthetic tube with a constant, uniform curvature radius. As a result, the real curvature radius moving along the tube spine will have some variations, which may also transform into defects, such as wrinkling or bumps. A modification of the traditionally operated control curves is proposed in the paper in order to improve the uniformity of the obtained curvature radius. Finally, a method is proposed for optimizing the control curves, under the presence of noise factors...|$|R

When rolling {{thread shaft}} in cross wedge rolling, forming quality of thread is {{affected}} by many process parameters such as the thread helix angle, which is a special and complex parameter.

Through the measurement of the point coordinates, the effect of the helix angle on the axial metal flow of rolled pieces was analyzed. Finally, the conclusion was obtained that helix angle causes the asymmetry of axial metal flow with small difference values for asymmetry and the axial metal flow of rolled pieces increases as the helix angle increases.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} experiments that enabled a flight demonstration of <b>roll</b> control without <b>moving</b> control surfaces. That goal was achieved using a wing with a partial span Glauert-type airfoil, characterized by an upper-surface boundary-layer separation from the two-thirds chord location at all incidence angles. The flow over that region was proportionally controlled using zero-mass-flux unsteady excitation emanating from piezofluidic actuators. The control was applied to one wing at a time, resulting in gradual suppression of the boundary-layer separation, increased lift, and reduced drag, leading to a coordinated turning motion of the small electric drone. The extensive multidisciplinary study (starting from the actuator adaptation, the airfoil integration, and the two dimensional wind-tunnel tests) led to {{the selection of a}} configuration for the flight demonstrator. Further development of a lightweight wing and piezofluidic actuators, along with a compact, lightweight, energy-efficient electronic drive system, was followed by full-scale wind-tunnel tests and three successful flight tests. It was flight demonstrated that active flow control can induce roll moments that are sufficient to control the vehicle flight path during cruise, as well as during landing. A linear model was used to predict the roll motion of the active-flow controlled drone, with reasonable agreement to the flight-test data. The current study resulted in several pioneering (to the best of our knowledge) achievements that should pave the way to further integration of active-flow-control methods in flight vehicles for hingeless flight attitude and flight-path control, as well as improved performance and increased reliability with lower observability...|$|R
