2500|$|Impulse control {{disorder}} (ICDs) are a {{class of}} DSM diagnoses that do not fall into the other diagnostic categories of the manual (e.g. substance use disorders), and that are characterized by extreme difficulty controlling impulses or urges despite negative consequences. [...] Individuals suffering from an impulse control disorder frequently experience five stages of symptoms: compelling urge or desire, failure to resist the urge, {{a heightened sense of}} arousal, succumbing to the urge (which usually yields <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> <b>tension),</b> and potential remorse or feelings of guilt after the behavior is completed. Specific disorders included within this category include intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, pathological gambling, pyromania, trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder), and impulse control disorders not otherwise specified (ICD NOS). ICD NOS includes other significant difficulties that seem to be related to impulsivity but do not meet the criteria for a specific DSM diagnosis.|$|E

2500|$|While {{full-time}} work hinders schooling, {{empirical evidence}} is varied {{on the relationship}} between part-time work and school. [...] Sometimes even part-time work may hinder school attendance or performance. [...] On the other hand, many poor children work for resources to attend school. Children who are not doing well at school sometimes seek more satisfactory experience in work. Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> <b>tensions</b> that children feel at school and home. [...] In the modern world, school education has become so central to society that schoolwork has become the dominant work for most children, often replacing participation in productive work. If school curricula or quality do not provide children with appropriate skills for available jobs or if children do nor have the aptitude for schoolwork, school may impede the learning of skills, such as agriculture, which will become necessary for future livelihood.|$|R

40|$|Meprobamate {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Ludwig and Piech in 1951. Its pharmacological properties {{have been studied}} by Berger, who described it as an interneuronal blocking agent related to mephene-sin (Berger, 1954; Berger, Hendley, Ludwig, and Lynes, 1956). He noted that when it was adminis-tered to monkeys they became more manageable and did not demonstrate fear when handled. Early reports of its clinical use were favourable, patients experiencing <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> anxiety, <b>tension,</b> and ten-sion headache (Borrus, 1955; Selling, 1955).

40|$|Background: The {{cross-sectional}} {{survey was}} conducted to assess and compare tobacco and alcohol usage among male medical and dental students among students belonging to dental and medical colleges in Davangere city. Materials and Methods: A self-designed questionnaire containing 20 close-ended questions was prepared to collect the required and relevant information pertaining to tobacco and alcohol consumption. The questionnaire was distributed among 400 students belonging to dental and medical colleges in Davangere city. Results: Among the 400 respondents, 48. 5 % were smokers and 45. 75 % of students were alcoholics. Among smokers, 55. 70 % were house surgeon students and 23. 07 % were 1 st year. Significant difference {{was found in the}} percentage of tobacco consumption among medical and dental house surgeon students. The main reason for smoking was examination preparation and workload. Among alcoholics, 51. 67 % were house surgeon students and 21. 9 % were 1 st year. The main reason for alcohol consumption was to get <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> <b>tensions.</b> Conclusions: Final year students and house surgeons had more influence of tobacco and alcohol consumption habits when compared to 1 st year students in both dental as well in medical college.

50|$|Modulating and {{controlling}} impulses {{is based on}} the capacity to hold sexual and aggressive feelings in check with out acting on them until the ego has evaluated whether they meet the individual's own moral standards and are acceptable in terms of social norms. Adequate functioning in this area depends on the individual's capacity to tolerate frustration, to delay gratification, and to tolerate anxiety without immediately acting to ameliorate it. Impulse control also depends on the ability to exercise appropriate judgment in situations where the individual is strongly motivated to seek <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> psychological <b>tension</b> and/or to pursue some pleasurable activity (sex, power, fame, money, etc.). Problems in modulation may involve either too little or too much control over impulses (Berzoff, 2011).|$|R
40|$|Most {{researchers}} {{agree that}} the essence of humour lies in its social nature. Thus it is only {{reasonable to assume that}} there is a link between laughter and success in relationships with other people and circumstances. Indeed, such conclusions have been drawn. Humour is said to develop the capacity to foster a multi-perspective comprehension of life, which can in extreme situations determine the difference between surviving and perishing. The people who fled Estonia during World War II {{and did not want to}} return for fear of being repressed by the Soviet regime, were generally allowed to apply for immigration in Western countries as refugees. This article pertains to some aspects of humour used in the written press by the New York Estonian refugee community in 1949. The character of a young lady called Salme is narrating her family’s first clumsy steps in their new homeland. The body of the text is in the form of letters addressed to former schoolmates who have not yet immigrated to their new permanent countries of residence, but are presumably still living in a displaced persons’ camp in Germany. It is argued that Salme’s letters were designed to provide comic <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> <b>tensions</b> common to new immigrants and old refugees. By showcasing the problems, concerns and actions that most (if not all) New York refugee Estonians could relate to, they promoted a light-hearted view of the difficulties of this particular type of existence. This set of texts is also used to make observations regarding the collective identity of the writers and their perceived audience, the intra-group relationships and connections with the outer world, Americans, the City and the array of cultural differences that they entail...|$|R
40|$|Bidis, or hand-rolled, filterless tobacco cigarettes, {{are largely}} marketed to and {{consumed}} by the poor in Bangladesh. In exploring perceived rationales and the situational contexts of smoking, this study identifies the crucial connections between bidi smoking and {{the social and economic}} forces that influence choices and shape the contexts of individual suffering. Ethnographic research in Netrakona District revealed that inexpensive bidis were used to gain <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> physical ailments specific to the poor, such as hunger, indigestion and constipation. Bidis were found to be a socially accepted mood-altering drug that symbolizes <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> their everyday <b>tensions,</b> angers, perceived exploitations and disappointments. I argue that both cultural norms of reciprocity and hierarchy as well as the socio-economic structure of Bangladesh with its inequality, poverty and exploitation contribute to the tobacco consumption and related health problems of the poor. 27 page(s...|$|R

In 2001, Sorkin along with colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse. However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector. He was ordered to a drug diversion program.|$|R

Bethune seemed particular about his air supply, and Jimmy surmised that he found it needful to move the case along the bottom to get a clear lead for the lifting line because the Cetacea had altered her position.

Though they had toiled hard and faced many perils together with mutual respect and confidence, he felt that he knew very little about the man. Moran’s reserve and stolid serenity were baffling. When strenuous action was required he could be relied upon, but even then he was seldom hurried, and his movements somehow suggested that his splendid frame was endowed with unreasoning, automatic powers. For all that, Jimmy knew that such a conception of his friend was wrong. He had seen the cool judgment and indomitable courage that controlled the man’s strength in time of heavy stress.|$|R
40|$|A {{one group}} intervention-based study was {{conducted}} in women jail, Karachi, Pakistan. The aim was to determine whether cognitive behavior therapy, administered in prison setting, was effective in reducing the frequency of deliberate self-harm in female prisoners. 40 female inmates were interviewed; nine inmates with a history of deliberate self-harm were screened out for 12 sessions of cognitive behavior therapy. Deliberate Self-harm Inventory (Gratz, 2001) and Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) were administered to explore deliberate self-harm behaviors and coping strategies of women prisoners. The number of deliberate self-harm episodes before and after therapy was the main outcome measure. An approximate 29 % incarcerated women reported deliberate self-harm. <b>Relief</b> <b>from</b> anger and <b>tension,</b> and feelings of hopelessness, and helplessness were the main motives. Cutting and burning were the most common types of deliberate self-harm behaviors reported. The frequency of self-harm episodes was minimal during and after therapy.

40|$|In {{order that}} Asian Americans be more {{adequately}} provided {{with mental health}} services, {{it will be necessary}} to: (1) have a thorough educational campaign {{over a long period of}} time to help Asians overcome their negative prejudices against mental illness, (2) devise culturally relevant diagnostic techniques, and (3) have treatment consonant with the cultural backgrounds of the patients and befitting the role expectations of the patients. It is likely that even with an excellent educational campaign, appropriate diagnoses, and culturally sensitive treatment methods, the first patients we will see will be those most seriously and chronically disturbed, probably when the family feels no longer able to cope with their psychotic behavior. We hope that subsequently, through the educational campaign and also through the outreach efforts of the Asian Mental Health Clinic, Asian Americans who are not psychotic but who want <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> psychosomatic symptoms, <b>tension,</b> depression, or help with family or marital problems will apply...|$|R
40|$|Glosses on Chancellor Angela Merkel: In {{ancient times}} the poets of Ireland and Scotland wrote satires on royals and chiefs they {{held to be}} {{administratively}} challenged and/or ungenerous to needy bards. The poems were not in strict form, but, generally, 17 line stanzas implied “should be put down”, while 13 line stanzas connoted “harmless but dim”. Walküre, whence Valkyrie, means “chooser of the slain” in Old German. In the bloodletting attending {{the formation of the}} present Grand Coalition in Germany, Edmund Stoiber was a casualty and withdrew, embittered, to lead Bavaria again. Angela is widely reported to find <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> the <b>tensions</b> of major political crises by baking cakes, a method more acceptable to the German middle-class than that once favoured by President Clinton. Prince Potemkin, lover and right-hand-man, of Czarina Catherine II, is – maybe slanderously – supposed to have had fake villages built in which actors mimed happy peasants as she drove past in her carriage. When Bush visited Angela’s provincial electorate, the real locals were sent somewhere else, while blokes from Germany’s security services replaced them, smiling, cheering and waving American flags. Consuming coffee and cake at 4 p. m. is the only Categorical Imperative that Germany absolutely obeys. The plot of Wagner’s Twilight of the Gods resembles a stale lamington, as do Germany’s present economic woes.

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the issue of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and the Internet, and the relationship between self-harm and subculture. The theoretical part characterizes the age of adolescence, as well as describing self-harm and the emo and gothic subcultures. The aim of the research was to discover the motivations that lead young people to write blogs about self-harm, whether they have their own experiences with self-harm, and if so, what are their experiences, their manner of self-harm, how they experience self-harming, and what are the causes. Another aim was to determine the role that social contagion plays in self-harm and how young people perceive the relationship between self-harm and culture-subculture. The research results showed that the causes of the respondents' self-harm are individual and that there are always several factors at play. As a trigger for self-harm the respondents stated stressful situations, annoyance, surging anger and hatred, depression, and feelings of inferiority. The causes of self-harm were diverse among respondents; they included family problems, parental divorce, death of a loved one, trouble at school, bullying, anorexia, abortion, and rape. Respondents indicated that self-harming served as a release, where mental pain was transformed into physical pain. In this way it provided <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> internal <b>tension</b> and anxiety. i have not found a direct link between emo subculture and self-harming among respondents. There was also an effort to understand the issue of self-harm, as such, more deeply...|$|R

Women {{were working}} alongside {{men in the}} military and its munitions factories, challenging pre-assigned gender roles.

Social realist films of the era include Target for Tonight (1941), In Which We Serve (1942), Millions Like Us (1943), and This Happy Breed (1944).
