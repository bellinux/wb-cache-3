5000|$|Some liquids possess {{relatively}} high expansion coefficients over a useful temperature ranges thus forming {{the basis for}} an alcohol or mercury thermometer. Alternative designs using this principle are the <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometer</b> and Beckmann differential thermometer.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike most {{conventional}} mercury thermometers, a <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometer</b> is able {{to record}} a given temperature to be viewed at a later time. If the thermometer is flipped upside down, the current temperature will be shown until it is turned upright again. This was the primary device used by oceanographers to determine water temperatures {{below the surface of}} the ocean from around 1900 to 1970.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{thermometer}} {{used throughout}} the Challenger expedition was the Miller-Casella thermometer, which contained two markers within a curved mercury tube to record the maximum and minimum temperature through which the instrument traveled. Several of these thermometers would be lowered at various depths for recording. However, this design assumed that the water closer {{to the surface of}} the ocean was always warmer than that below. During the voyage, Challenger crew tested the <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometer,</b> which could measure temperature at specified depths. Afterwards, this type of thermometer was used extensively until the second half of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Scientists {{aboard the}} HMS Challenger later {{questioned}} this assumption and made temperutare measurements with <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometers</b> instead which wouldn't require the coldest water {{to be at}} the ocean's bottom.|$|R
50|$|Instrument {{packages}} have {{consisted of}} three precision velocimeters (two NUS TR-4's and one TR-5), two Dymec temperature sensors, one Bissett-Berman salinometer, one or two Vibrotrons, and four Fjarlie bottles with four <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometers</b> each. Accuracy is enhanced by meticulous calibrations before and after dive series, delicate handling of all equipment, intercomparison of several instruments, consistently careful measurements, and correct assessments of thermal lags and pressure effects. Results are compared with existing equations for sound speed versus temperature, salinity, and pressure.The United States has made a torpedo shaped probe called the Deep Flight.|$|R
50|$|Being {{commissioned}} in 1982 RV Uthörn replaced {{a vessel}} {{with the same}} name which was built in 1947 and had a length of 24 m. The current vessel is powered by two V12four-stroke Diesel engines manufactured by the company MWM GmbH from Mannheim. Each engine delivers up to 231 kW to a controllable-pitch propeller; the maximal speed is around 10 kn.On the working deck, there is a dry lab and a laboratory for wet work like sorting fish. The ship is equipped with standard sampling devices: You may find on board a demersal trawl, a Van Veen Grab Sampler, Niskin bottles, and even deprecated <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometers</b> for teaching purposes.|$|R
50|$|The sea {{temperature}} {{at the water}} sampling depth is recorded {{by means of a}} <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometer</b> fixed to the Nansen bottle. This is a mercury thermometer with a constriction in its capillary tube which, when the thermometer is inverted, causes the thread to break and trap the mercury, fixing the temperature reading. Since water pressure at depth will compress the thermometer walls and affect the indicated temperature, the thermometer is protected by a rigid enclosure. A non-protected thermometer is paired with the protected one, and comparison of the two temperature readings allows both temperature and pressure at the sampling point to be determined.|$|E
50|$|The Niskin bottle is a {{development}} of the Nansen bottle patented by Shale Niskin in March 1966. Instead of a metal bottle sealed at one end, the 'bottle' is a tube, usually plastic to minimize contamination of the sample, {{and open to the}} water at both ends. Each end is equipped with a cap which is either spring-loaded or tensioned by an elastic rope. The action of the messenger weight is to trip both caps shut and seal the tube. A <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometer</b> may also be carried on a frame fixed to the Niskin bottle. Since there is no rotation of the bottle to fix the temperature measurement, the thermometer has a separate spring-loaded rotating mechanism of its own tripped by the messenger weight.|$|E
30|$|Water {{temperature}} and salinity were measured using a <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometer</b> and an inductive salinometer, respectively. Data {{collected by the}} T.S. Oshoro Maru were cited from ‘Data Record of Oceanographic Observations and Exploratory Fishing’ (Hokkaido University 1967), and those from the R.V. Hakuho Maru were provided by the Center for Cruise Coordination, Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, the University of Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|Fish Hawk {{also was}} {{outfitted}} to conduct general scientific {{research related to}} fisheries, including depth sounding, measuring {{the temperature of the}} sea bottom, and collecting marine animals and plants. She had a hoisting winch with 1,000 fathoms (6,000 feet; 1,829 meters) of steel cable for trawling and dredging, an otter trawl, a 9-foot (2.75-meter) beam trawl, an 11-foot (3.6-meter) beam trawl, a 17-foot (5.2-meter) beam trawl, Blake and Chester rake dredges, and a tangle bar, the latter an iron axle and wheels with deck swabs or bundles of rope yarn on chains that Fish Hawk could drag along the sea bottom to capture marine animals and plants. For hydrography, she had a sounding machine with 600 fathoms (3,600 feet; 1,097 meters) of piano wire, deep-sea <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometers,</b> and density salinometers.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a conventional bulb connected to a capillary in which a constriction is placed so that upon reversal the mercury column breaks off in a reproducible manner. The mercury runs down into a smaller bulb {{at the other end}} of the capillary, which is graduated to read temperature. A 360° turn in a locally widened portion of the capillary serves as a trap to prevent further addition of mercury if the thermometer is warmed and the mercury expands past the break-off point. The remote-reading potentialities of <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometers</b> make them particularly suitable for use in measuring subsea temperature as a function of pressure. In this application, both protected thermometers and unprotected thermometers are used, each of which is provided with an auxiliary thermometer. They are generally used in pairs in Nansen bottles. They are usually read to 0.01°C, and after the proper corrections have been applied, their readings are considered reliable to 0.02°C.|$|R

40|$|Exchanges {{between the}} North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean {{result in the}} most {{dramatic}} water mass conversions in the World Ocean: warm and saline Atlantic waters, flowing through the Nordic Seas into the Arctic Ocean, are modified by cooling, freezing and melting to become shallow fresh waters, ice and saline deep waters. The outflow from the Nordic Seas to the south provides the initial driving of the global thermohaline circulation cell. Knowledge of these fluxes {{and understanding of the}} modification processes is a major prerequisite for the quantification of the rate of overturning within the large circulation cells of the Arctic and the Atlantic Oceans, and is also a basic requirement for understanding the role of these ocean areas in climate variability on interannual to decadal time scales. The Fram Strait represents the only deep connection between the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas. Just as the freshwater transport from the Arctic Ocean is of major influence on convection in the Nordic Seas and further south, the transport of warm and saline Atlantic water affects the water mass characteristics in the Arctic Ocean which has consequences for the internal circulation and possibly influences also ice and atmosphere. The West Spitsbergen Current carrying Atlantic Water northward. The East Greenland Current, carrying water from the Arctic Ocean southwards has a concentrated core above the continental slope. It is our aim to measure the oceanic fluxes through Fram Strait and to determine their variability in seasonal to decadal time scales. 53 CTD profiles were taken at 51 stations. Two CTD systems from Sea-Bird Electronics Inc SBE 911 + were used. Mainly SN 561 with duplicate T and C sensors (temperature sensors SBE 3, SN 2685 and 2678, conductivity sensors SBE 4, SN 2325 and 2618 and pressure sensor Digiquartz 410 K- 105 SN 75659) was in service. For the control of the temperature sensors a SBE 35 RT digital <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometer,</b> SN 27 was applied. The CTD was connected to a SBE 32 Carousel Water Sampler, SN 273 (24 12 -liter bottles). For 3 CTD-Stations (726 - 3, 727 - 1, 728 - 1) the Sea-Bird 911 + probe SN 485 was used with temperature sensor SBE 3 SN 2460, conductivity sensor SBE 4 SN 2054, pressure sensor Digiquartz 410 K SN 68997 and the SBE 32 Carousel Water Sampler SN 202. Additionally Benthos Altimeters Model 2110 - 2, SN 189 and SN 208 and Wetlabs C-Star Transmissiometers SN 403 and SN 267 were mounted on the carousels.

40|$|The Research Vessel Stranger of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego, {{was engaged}} in the Naga Expedition in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea {{during the period of}} October, 1959, to December, 1960. The {{expedition}} was jointly sponsored by the Governments of South Viet Nam, Thailand and the United States of America. It had a two-fold purpose; to collect oceanographic, biological and fisheries data and material and to train scientists and technicians from Thailand and South Viet Nam in oceanography and marine biology. This report is a description of the oceanographic environment in the Gulf of Thailand derived from oceanographic and meteorological data collected for the most part on six cruises in the Gulf between October, 1959, and December, 1960. The cruise plans for the Gulf of Thailand were designed to investigate systematically the distribution and variability of the physical properties of the Gulf waters. The station plan consisted of stations located 30 to 40 miles apart on five parallel lines running perpendicular to the east and west coasts of the Gulf. The lines were 60 to 90 miles apart. Figure 1 is a composite plan for the five Gulf cruises which made complete hydrographic measurements. The stations were numbered chronologically on each cruise. Thus, stations at approximately the same location have different numbers on each of the cruises. Within the limits of navigation the primary stations on each line were at the same location on each cruise. The following physical oceanographic data were collected at each station; <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometer</b> temperatures, salinity and oxygen determinations at standard levels— 0, 10, 20, 30 and 50 m—as depth allowed and bathythermograph (BT) temperature observations. The latter were also taken midway between regular stations and at intervals parallel to shore between station lines. Meteorological observations, including wind, air temperature and sea condition, were taken at the time of each BT. Station data and a description of the physical and chemical methods may be found in Faughn, NAGA report, volume 1. The R. V. Stranger of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography carried out an extensive geophysical survey of the Timor Sea between March 29 and April 24, 1961, (van Andel and Veevers, 1967) following the completion of the major oceanographic observational programs in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea. During the survey, closely spaced bathythermograph (BT) temperature and wind velocity observations were made. Observed wind velocities, vertical temperature sections along the cruise tracks and horizontal distributions of temperature at standard depth levels based on BT data are the subject of this report. These observations provide {{a detailed description of the}} temperature structure of the Timor Sea and complement the more general one given by Wytrki (1961) ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 In {{comparison}} with solar radiation, {{the energy of}} geothermal heat flowing through the sea bottom is extremely small; nevertheless, this energy is not insignificant in the circulation of the bottom water. Calculations indicate that in the deep basins of the South Atlantic the water volume transport necessary to remove this heat is at least one-tenth of the total northward flow of Antarctic Bottom Water. Plots of mean values of near bottom salinity and oxygen versus mean potential temperatures help to trace {{the movement of the}} bottom water. Geothermal and adiabatic warming associated with downslope flow combine to produce a deep temperature (in situ) minimum in portions of most of the deep basins of the world. Adiabatic or near adiabatic temperature gradients have been measured near the bottom in many of these basins. Evidence of superadiabatic gradients from temperature measurements made with <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometers</b> is inconclusive; however, careful measurements with closely spaced thermometers suggest that such gradients do exist over vertical distances of a few hundred meters in some of the deepest basins. Decreasing potential density with depth, as found in some of the Atlantic Basins in association with sharp temperature and salinity gradients, is not necessarily an indication of unstable equilibrium. This is demonstrated by the results of stability calculations in the manner prescribed by Hesselberg and Sverdrup (1915) ...|$|R
40|$|The Inst. of Marine Researche in Bergen {{has since}} 1935 on a {{regulary}} basis acquired data from fixed hydrographic stations on the Norwegian coast. The data are collected by local residents via water samplers and <b>reversing</b> <b>thermometers,</b> {{and the material}} is mailed to the Institute appr. twice per month. In order to reduce costs and also to make possible automatic acquisition of data in real or close to real time, a new data communication system for hydrographic data has been developed. In the new system the local observers will measure STD-data with a portable, recording STD instrument. After having finished a STD profile, the observer connects his instrument to a communication system based on a mobile telephone, a modem and a communication interface. At programmable intervals a central PC at the Inst. of Marine Research will sequentially dial the telephone number for each operative communication unit. If an STD instrument has been connected, its recorded data will be loaded to a file in the PC. If no STD has been is connected, the system will continue to the next telephone number. The paper explains the instrumentation, the communication system and the software which has been developed for the system. Results from a field test are also presented.

Glycerol carbonate is commonly used as a raw material for polymers, surfactants, emulsifiers, lubricants, paints, also used in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, the research {{was carried out by}} using a batch reactor with a three-neck flask equipped with <b>reverse</b> cooling, <b>thermometers,</b> mercury stirrer, and heating mantle with the conditions of the reaction temperature around 373 – 413 K, mole ratio of reactants of urea: glycerol were 1 : 0, 5, 1 : 1, 1 : 1, 5, 1 : 2 and 1 : 4 and the concentration of catalyst were 1 %, 2 %, 3 %, 4 % and 5 % respectively.

Absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible, is defined as being exactly 0 K and −273.15 °C. The temperature of the triple point of water is defined as exactly 273.16 K.|$|R
60|$|Within doors, in the tropics, ants {{are apt to}} put {{themselves}} obtrusively forward in a manner little gratifying to any except the enthusiastically entomological mind. The winged females, after their marriage flight, have a disagreeable habit of flying in at the open doors and windows at lunch time, settling upon the table like the Harpies in the Æneid, and then quietly shuffling off their wings one at a time, by holding them down against the table-cloth with one leg, and running away vigorously with the five others. As soon as they have thus disembarrassed themselves of their superfluous members, they proceed to run about over the lunch as if the house belonged to them, {{and to make a}} series of experiments upon the edible qualities of the different dishes. One doesn't so much mind their philosophical inquiries into the nature of the bread or even the meat; but when they come to drowning themselves by dozens, in the pursuit of knowledge, in the soup and sherry, one feels bound to protest energetically against the spirit of martyrdom by which they are too profoundly animated. That is one of the slight drawbacks of the realms of perpetual summer; in the poets you see only one side of the picture--the palms, the orchids, the humming-birds, the great trailing lianas: in practical life you see the <b>reverse</b> side--the <b>thermometer</b> at 98°, the tepid drinking-water, the prickly heat, the perpetual languor, the endless shoals of aggressive insects.
