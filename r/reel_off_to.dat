50|$|Wallace faced {{widespread}} {{accusations that}} he used ghost writers to churn out books, {{though there is no}} evidence of this, and his prolificness became something of a joke, the subject of cartoons and sketches. His 'three day books', <b>reeled</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> keep the loan sharks from the door, were unlikely to garner great critical praise and Wallace claimed not to find literary value in his own works.|$|R

60|$|In my town house, in Oakland, I {{finished}} {{the stock of}} liquor and wilfully refused to purchase more. It was no use, because, unfortunately, there remained {{in the bottom of}} the liquor cabinet a case of beer. In vain I tried to write. Now beer is a poor substitute for strong waters: besides, I didn't like beer, yet all I could think of was that beer so singularly accessible {{in the bottom of the}} cabinet. Not until I had drunk a pint of it did the words begin <b>to</b> <b>reel</b> <b>off,</b> and the thousand were <b>reeled</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the tune of numerous pints. The worst of it was that the beer caused me severe heart-burn; but despite the discomfort I soon finished off the case.|$|R
60|$|After {{the horn}} and bead labors were over, the {{stringing}} of pop-corn on red, and cranberries on white, threads, came next, and Jack and Jill often {{looked like a}} new kind of spider in the pretty webs hung about them, till <b>reeled</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> bide their time in the Christmas closet. Paper flowers followed, and gay garlands and bouquets blossomed, regardless of the snow and frost without. Then there was a great scribbling of names, verses, and notes to accompany the steadily increasing store of odd parcels which were collected at the Minots', for gifts from every one were to ornament the tree, and contributions poured in as the day drew near.|$|R
60|$|Emil always {{announced}} {{his arrival in}} that fashion, {{and in a moment}} he came hurrying in with Nat, who had been giving lessons in town all day. It was good to see the latter beam at his friend as he nearly shook his hand off; better still to see how Dan gratefully remembered all he owed Nat, and tried to pay the debt in his rough way; and best of all to hear the two travellers compare notes and <b>reel</b> <b>off</b> yarns <b>to</b> dazzle the land-lubbers and home-keepers.|$|R
50|$|The {{second day}} {{began with the}} Red Group with Wimbledon, US Open and Olympic {{champion}} Serena Williams and 2011 French Open champion Li Na. The match began with Williams breaking Lis serve to take an early 1-0 lead. However Li was quick <b>to</b> strike back <b>reeling</b> <b>off</b> four games <b>to</b> take a 4-1 lead only to see Williams comeback to take four straight games herself to take a 5-4 lead to serve for the set. Li was able to break at love for 5-5 but was broken right back. Williams again served for the set but was broken again at love to send the set into a tie-breaker. Williams won it comfortably 7-2 to take a one set lead. The second began in similar fashion with Li breaking for a 1-0 lead only to see Williams again <b>reel</b> <b>off</b> four games <b>to</b> take a 4-1 lead. The rest of the set went on serve until Williams closed out the match 7-6(7-2), 6-3.|$|R

This horse has also a lock on the Most-Improved Horse title for his meteoric ratings rise of 72 points from 52 to 124 from 11 outings. More Bountiful also {{is one of the}} nominees of Hong Kong Horse of the Year.|$|R
6000|$|But though I was so {{terrified by}} the idea of the {{seafaring}} man with one leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked old wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call for glasses round, and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the house shaking with [...] "Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum"; all the neighbours joining in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing louder than the other, to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table, for silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question, or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not following his story. Nor would he allow any one to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and <b>reeled</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> bed.|$|R
60|$|THE BISHOP. You see, my dear, youll exhaust Sinjon's {{conversation}} too {{in a week}} or so. A man is like a phonograph with half-a-dozen records. You soon {{get tired}} of them all; and yet you have to sit at table whilst he <b>reels</b> them <b>off</b> <b>to</b> every new visitor. In the end you have to be content with his common humanity; and when you come down to that, you find out about men what a great English poet of my acquaintance used to say about women: that they all taste alike. Marry whom you please: {{at the end of a}} month he'll be Reginald over again. It wasnt worth changing: indeed it wasnt.|$|R
5000|$|Kidd {{took over}} a Madison-Model program that {{produced}} a 23-36-12 record from 1947 to 1955. He led the Purples to a 54-11-1 record from 1956 to 1961. His 54 wins rank him as the third winningest coach in Madison football history behind Lassiter (86 wins in 20 years) and Monty Joe Lovell (77 wins in 11 years). Kidd's [...]818 winning percentage {{is the best in}} Richmond Madison football history. His first team (1956) <b>reeled</b> <b>off</b> nine wins <b>to</b> finish the regular season undefeated and collected the most wins of any Madison team since the sport was initiated at the Richmond high school in 1921.|$|R

He promised to get a minister, and 'tend to it, and wait a day till it was all over, and then take her on to Boston free gratis. But 'twas all no go. She wouldn't hear a word to 't. And she <b>reeled</b> <b>off</b> the talk <b>to</b> him by the yard. And, when talk failed, she took to her water-works again, till finally the cap'n said his {{resolution}} was clean washed away, and he jest give up hook and line; and so 'twas all settled and arranged, that, when evening come, {{she was to be}} alongside with her boat, and took aboard.|$|R
50|$|He was a Sky Sports {{pick for}} the Premier League. Whitlock won seven of his {{fourteen}} league games, including 100-plus averages in victories over Gary Anderson and Kevin Painter, to finish 2nd {{in the table}} and therefore qualify for the play-offs. Whitlock played Andy Hamilton in the semi-finals, against whom he drew 7-7 and lost 4-8 during the league campaign. He hit a nine darter in the second leg of the semi-final, {{but this was the}} only leg he could win early on as he trailed 1-4. Whitlock came back into the match and took the lead {{for the first time at}} 7-6, before holding throw to reach his first Premier League final. There he played Phil Taylor and looked to heading for a tame defeat as Taylor led 7-2. Whitlock, though, hit back brilliantly to win five successive legs to level the match, but couldn't complete another comeback victory as Taylor <b>reeled</b> <b>off</b> 3 legs <b>to</b> win 10-7.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, the Kastles got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a {{slow start}} and after the first seven matches of the season the team's record was 4-3. In typical Kastles style, the team then <b>reeled</b> <b>off</b> 5 wins {{in a row and}} won 6 out of the 7 final matches of the regular season to end up with a record of 10-4, {{the best record in the}} WTT's Eastern Conference.|$|R
25|$|On March 26 1-seeded Wisconsin {{defeated}} 2-seeded Arizona 85 to 78 for a berth to the Final Four. This {{set up a}} re-match between Kentucky and Wisconsin at the Final Four, {{this time}} in Indianapolis. On April 4 Kentucky and Wisconsin faced off for a berth to the National Championship game against Duke. The Wildcats, once trailing by nine {{points in the first}} half and eight early in the second, were poised to close out another opponent in the final minutes, this time in the Final Four. With an 8 to 0 run and their defense holding Wisconsin scoreless for more than six minutes, the Cats grabbed a 60-56 lead with less than five minutes remaining. The Badgers <b>reeled</b> <b>off</b> an 8 <b>to</b> 0 run of their own that Sam Dekker started. Next, Nigel Hayes tied the game with a put-back. It was the last of Wisconsin's 12 offensive rebounds and 13 second-chance points. Wisconsin handed Kentucky its lone loss of the season, defeating the Wildcats 71 to 64.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1971 Wigginton, by then married with a child, turned down an offer {{to give up his}} last year of {{eligibility}} to coach at West Texas State and instead returned to back up Phillips again. He got his first career start against Texas Tech when Phillips re-injured his hamstring against UCLA and he led the #3 Longhorns to victory. The next week against Oregon, Phillips again injured his hamstring and Wigginton came <b>off</b> the bench <b>to</b> play the last three quarters in a 35-7 rout. He started the following week against #7 Oklahoma and scored two touchdowns, but left the game in the 3rd quarter with a separated rib and the Longhorns down by 10. Texas would lose and fall to #10 in the rankings. Wigginton then started the next three games, losing to #16 Arkansas and then <b>reeling</b> <b>off</b> back <b>to</b> back wins against Rice and SMU. Phillips was back as the starter against Baylor, but the next week against TCU Wiggington again came in for Phillips when Phillips went down in the third quarter with an injured shoulder. Wigginton rushed for 60 yards and two touchdowns, and turned a 7-0 nail-biter into a 31-0 rout. He then started the last game of the season against Texas A&M, scored two touchdowns and helped Texas secure another Southwest Conference Championship. He shared quarterback duties in the Cotton Bowl with starter Phillips in a 30-6 loss to Penn State, who was determined to avenge their denial of the 1969 National Championship.|$|R

Following a bye week, Groh's Virginia team rebounded and <b>reeled</b> <b>off</b> three {{straight}} wins, including two road ACC wins (North Carolina and Maryland) and a blow-out over the Big Ten's Indiana. However, after the three straight wins, Virginia <b>reeled</b> <b>off</b> 6 straight losses {{to close the}} season.
