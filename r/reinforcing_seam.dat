50|$|Most MMA fighters used {{specialized}} compression shirts, called Rash guards, to train. Rash {{guards are}} not regular compression shirts. Ground training techniques have required that these shirts provide <b>reinforced</b> <b>seams</b> and stitching, with additional panels {{to support the}} additional stress placed on the shirt during training while continuing to provide the benefits provided by regular compression shirts.|$|R
50|$|Twill tape is a flat twill-woven {{ribbon of}} cotton, linen, polyester, or wool. It {{may be used}} in sewing and {{tailoring}} to <b>reinforce</b> <b>seams,</b> make casings, bind edges, and make sturdy ties for closing garments (for example, on hospital gowns). Twill tape is also used in theatre to tie curtains, cable and scenery to various objects, or to tie cable coils so that they do not unroll.|$|R
50|$|Rugby shorts {{must be able}} to {{withstand}} punishment and should be thick enough to provide some protection while playing. Most have pockets and many have a drawstring to prevent them coming down when tackled. While the most popular material has been cotton, modern shorts can also be made from higher grade polyester with <b>reinforced</b> <b>seams.</b> The use of these shorts is increasing as they are lighter, more durable, more comfortable, and better retain their color compared to traditional cotton shorts.|$|R
50|$|The Avenue Q puppets, {{which cost}} up to $10,000 each, and require up to 120 hours of hand {{fabrication}} per character, were designed and built by original cast member Rick Lyon. Lyon's company, Lyon Puppets, continues to build and maintain the puppets used in all North American productions, {{and several of the}} international productions, including those from the UK, Australia, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, while supervising the construction of those from the Finnish and Swedish productions. Their unusually sturdy construction, with double-stitching, <b>reinforced</b> <b>seams,</b> steel boning, and custom fake fur and feathers, is necessitated by the rigors of an eight-shows-per-week performance schedule.|$|R
5000|$|The Swiss Militärblache is {{square and}} has a side length of 165 centimeters. It {{consists}} of chemically modified Cotton and has <b>reinforced</b> <b>seams,</b> giving it a very high tensile strength. Along the edges are 3 2buttonholes and 64 Aluminium buttons installed in double rows, {{making it possible to}} connect two Militärnlachen. In every Militärblache is a removable tent cord who is two meters long incorporated a 60 cm long [...] "neck strap" [...] and four corner and center ribs. In the corners are each a strong metal eyelet as a holder for a tent pole. The dry Militärblache weighs 1.25 kg.|$|R
500|$|Little {{physical}} evidence survives {{to reconstruct the}} early development of English embroidery before the Norman Conquest of 1066. [...] Stitches <b>reinforcing</b> the <b>seams</b> of a garment in the Sutton Hoo ship burial may have been intended as decoration, and so be classed as embroidery, and fragments of a scrolling border worked in stem stitch were recovered from a grave in Kempston, Bedfordshire. [...] Some embroidered pieces of about 850 preserved in Maaseik, Belgium, are generally assumed to be Anglo-Saxon work based on their similarity to contemporary manuscript illustrations and sculptures of animals and interlace.|$|R
50|$|The process used to tailor, patch, mend and {{reinforce}} cloth fostered {{the development of}} sewing techniques, and the decorative possibilities of sewing led {{to the art of}} embroidery.Indeed, the remarkable stability of basic embroidery stitches has been noted:The art of embroidery has been found world-wide and several early examples have been found. Works in China have been dated to the Warring States period (5th-3rd century BC). In a garment from Migration period Sweden, roughly 300-700 AD, the edges of bands of trimming are reinforced with running stitch, back stitch, stem stitch, tailor's buttonhole stitch, and whip-stitching, but it is uncertain whether this work simply <b>reinforced</b> the <b>seams</b> or should be interpreted as decorative embroidery.|$|R
5000|$|Mail Storage {{requires}} more stringent and diligent packing than standard moving, since the packages will {{be handled by}} shippers or a mail storage company's pickup/delivery service. For example, the thin walls of standard moving boxes cannot withstand the multiple transfers, stacking and other rigors of the shipping / mailing process. Further, failing to pack the boxes fully may result in boxes that [...] "cave in" [...] when other boxes are stacked on them. Mail Storage companies often request customers to use thick walled or reinforced shipping boxes, to <b>reinforce</b> the <b>seams</b> with heavy duty packing tape, and to pack boxes to their fullest (while not over-stuffing them). This advice applies to boxes provided by Mail Storage firms as well as boxes provided by the customer. Many mail storage companies charge re-boxing and handling fees for boxes that are poorly packed or damaged on arrival. In addition, insurance charges that were paid by customers may not apply for boxes that were damaged in transit.|$|R
5000|$|The 1712 boiler was {{assembled}} from riveted copper {{plates with}} a domed top made {{of lead in}} the first examples. Later boilers were made of small wrought iron plates riveted together. The problem was producing big enough plates, so that even pressures of around [...] were not absolutely safe, nor was the cast iron hemispherical boiler initially used by Richard Trevithick. This construction with small plates persisted until the 1820s, when larger plates became feasible and could be rolled into a cylindrical form with just one butt-jointed <b>seam</b> <b>reinforced</b> by a gusset; Timothy Hackworth's Sans Pareil 11 of 1849 had a longitudinal welded seam. Welded construction for locomotive boilers was extremely slow to take hold.|$|R
50|$|After {{three years}} {{experience}} — including packing at least 200 reserves, 100 each {{of two different}} types — Senior Riggers can test for the Master Rigger rating which allows them to do most major repairs. There is no written test for Master Riggers, but the oral exam is far more extensive, including identifying dozens of material samples. The Master practical exam starts with assembling and adjusting a sewing machine, then doing a major canopy repair that includes a <b>seam,</b> <b>reinforcing</b> tape and line attachment. Master candidates are usually asked to demonstrate a harness repair also.FAA riggers are tested by Parachute Rigger Examiners (government employees) or Designated Parachute Rigger Examiners (independent civilians, usually highly-experienced Master Riggers).U.S. military riggers only need a letter from their commanding officer and the written test to earn FAA rigger ratings.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} resist fluid {{penetration}} {{was measured in}} body fabric and forearm seams of standard and reinforced non-woven disposable theatre gowns. Six standard use, non-woven gowns showed water strike-through in the body area at pressures ranging between 12. 1 +/- 0. 8 cmH 2 O and 23. 2 +/- 2. 2 cmH 2 O (means +/- 95 % confidence interval). Two products resisted fluid penetration of the forearm seam at pressures {{similar to that of}} the fabric alone (16. 8 +/- 1. 0 cmH 2 O and 18. 6 +/- 0. 9 cmH 2 O respectively) but other standard gowns leaked at significantly lower pressures (range 4. 6 - 6. 9 cmH 2 O). (P < 0. 05, Mann-Whitney U test). Six of seven high-protection gowns proved fluid resistant at a pressure in excess of 50 cm in the reinforced body zone but four reinforced gowns leaked at stitched arm seams at a pressure of less than 10 cmH 2 O despite an inner impermeable layer of fabric covering the forearm. Three gowns with heat or adhesive sealed <b>reinforced</b> arm <b>seams</b> resisted fluid penetration up to a pressure of 50 cmH 2 O. Standard gowns and some reinforced gowns do not offer full protection against forearm contamination through stitched seams. A gown with sealed seams and impermeable fabric should be chosen for high-risk cases...|$|R

5000|$|Stitch & Glue designs {{typically}} use modern, marine-grade plywood — eighth-inch, 3 mm {{or up to}} quarter-inch, 5 mm thick. After {{cutting out}} the required pieces of hull and deck (kits often have these pre-cut), {{a series of small}} holes are drilled along the edges. Copper wire is then used to [...] "stitch" [...] the pieces together through the holes. After the pieces are temporarily stitched together, they are glued with epoxy and the <b>seams</b> <b>reinforced</b> with fiberglass. When the epoxy dries, the copper stitches are removed. Sometimes the entire boat is then covered in fiberglass for additional strength and waterproofing though this adds greatly to the weight and is unnecessary. Construction is fairly straightforward, but because plywood does not bend to form compound curves, design choices are limited. This is a good choice for the first-time kayak builder as the labor and skills required (especially for kit versions) is considerably less than for strip-built boats which can take 3 times as long to build.|$|R
5000|$|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy {{states that}} a towel {{is the most}} {{important}} item a hitchhiker can have. It also mentions that [...] "to know where one's towel is" [...] means to be in control of one's own life. It describes the towel as a multipurpose tool which can be converted into such things as a sail for a makeshift raft, a gas mask, a blindfold and a weapon for hand-to-hand combat. Resourceful hitchhikers have enhanced their towels in highly exotic ways, including embedding complex circuitry; Roosta, who Ford Prefect says [...] "really knows where his towel is", fortified his towel with yellow stripes high in protein, green stripes with vitamin supplements, pink flowers of wheatgerm extract, and other areas containing barbecue sauce and anti-depressants. Ford Prefect, a traditionalist, has so far only <b>reinforced</b> his towel's <b>seams,</b> which enabled him {{to use it as a}} rope to stop himself from falling to his death. In the TV series, towels move of their own accord during hyperspatial jumps, and the amount they've moved allows an experienced hitchhiker to calculate the distance he has travelled. The towel was useful in the film version a handful of times, mainly by Ford. For example, while on the homeworld of the Vogons, he started to wave it around in front of a group of Vogons, who screamed and ran away. He also used it while attempting to cross the beach infested with shovel-like creatures which feed on thought. Another time, he used it to pull the pipe from the Vogon ship, attempting to increase the range of his ring.|$|R
