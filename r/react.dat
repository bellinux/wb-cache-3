40|$|Several {{recently}} isolated monoclonal antibodies which <b>reacted</b> with {{simian virus}} 40 T antigens also <b>reacted</b> with proteins found in uninfected and untransformed cells. The proteins {{were different from}} each other, PAb 419 <b>reacting</b> with a 35, 000 -molecular-weight protein, PAb 427 <b>reacting</b> with a 75, 000 -molecular-weight phosphoprotein, PAb 405 <b>reacting</b> with a 150, 000 -molecular-weight phosphoprotein, and PAb 204 <b>reacting</b> with a 68, 000 -molecular-weight protein. It is suggested that although some of these cross-reactions may be fortuitous, they may, as an alternative, reflect similarities of shape and perhaps function between domains of the viral T antigen and the relevant host proteins...|$|R
40|$|Murine {{monoclonal}} antibodies reactive with {{staphylococcal enterotoxins}} B (SEB) and C 1 (SEC 1) were isolated by hybridoma techniques. Of the nine antibodies, three <b>reacted</b> only with SEB, two <b>reacted</b> with SEB and SEC 1, three <b>reacted</b> with all subtypes of SEC, and one <b>reacted</b> only with SEC 2 and SEC 3.

5|$|Hydrogen, {{like some}} of the alkali metals, reacts explosively with fluorine. Carbon, as lamp black, reacts at room {{temperature}} to yield fluoromethane. Graphite combines with fluorine above 400°C (750°F) to produce non-stoichiometric carbon monofluoride; higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons, sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide <b>react</b> at or just above room temperature, whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride, normally incombustible, may explode. Although nitrogen trifluoride is stable, nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur, due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may <b>react</b> explosively. Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions, but can be made to <b>react</b> using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens <b>react</b> readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon; of the other noble gases, only xenon and krypton <b>react,</b> and only under special conditions.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{reactive}} element in its group; it is pyrophoric when finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids, giving Fe2+. However, it does not <b>react</b> with concentrated nitric acid and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an impervious oxide layer, which can nevertheless <b>react</b> with hydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Potassium reacts violently with halogens and detonates in the {{presence}} of bromine. It also reacts explosively with sulfuric acid. During combustion, potassium forms peroxides and superoxides. These peroxides may <b>react</b> violently with organic compounds such as oils. Both peroxides and superoxides may <b>react</b> explosively with metallic potassium.|$|E
50|$|One {{method of}} {{synthesis}} of cyclopropyl cyanide is through reducing methy 3-cyanopropionate with lithium borodeuteride. This reduction yields an alcohol, which is further <b>reacted</b> triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrachloride. The product, 4-chlorobutyronitrile, is <b>reacted</b> with sodium iodide {{to replace the}} chloride with the iodide. Lastly, the molecule is turned into a cyclic molecule by <b>reacting</b> with sodium hydride. Another proposed method of synthesis involves <b>reacting</b> 4-chlorobutyronitrile with sodium amide. The sodium amide is produced by <b>reacting</b> solid sodium and liquid ammonia.|$|R
50|$|There is a four-step {{synthesis}} of methiopropamine. It begins with (thiophen-2-yl)magnesium bromide, which is <b>reacted</b> with propylene oxide, yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-hydroxypropane which is <b>reacted</b> with phosphorus tribromide, yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-bromopropane which is finally <b>reacted</b> with methylamine, yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-methylaminopropane.|$|R

5|$|The {{hydroxides}} {{themselves are}} the most basic hydroxides known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides. They easily <b>react</b> with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates, or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides, and {{may be used to}} separate thiols from petroleum. They <b>react</b> with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of aluminium, zinc, tin, and lead <b>react</b> with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. Silicon dioxide is acidic, and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass.|$|E
5|$|The lichen's cortex and medulla <b>react</b> {{positively}} with potassium hydroxide (K), turning yellow. Cortex and medulla <b>react</b> {{positively with}} para-phenylenediamene (Pd) as well, also turning yellow. They produce no reaction with calcium or sodium hypochlorite (bleach – C), nor with KC (potassium hydroxide quickly followed by bleach). Among the substances {{produced by the}} lichen are atranorin and zeorin.|$|E
5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} <b>react</b> with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally decompose {{to eliminate a}} β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums <b>react</b> as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} are highly {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They <b>react</b> aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also <b>react</b> with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals <b>react</b> more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals <b>react</b> with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E

5|$|As {{tetravalent}} transition metals, {{all three}} elements form various inorganic compounds, generally in the oxidation state of +4. For {{the first three}} metals, {{it has been shown}} that they are resistant to concentrated alkalis, but halogens <b>react</b> with them to form tetrahalides. At higher temperatures, all three metals <b>react</b> with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. Because of the lanthanide contraction of the elements in the fifth period, zirconium and hafnium have nearly identical ionic radii. The ionic radius of Zr4+ is 79picometers and that of Hf4+ is 78pm.|$|E

50|$|OF2 <b>reacts</b> {{with many}} metals to yield oxides and fluorides. Nonmetals also react: {{phosphorus}} <b>reacts</b> with OF2 to form PF5 and POF3; sulfur gives SO2 and SF4; and unusually for a noble gas, xenon <b>reacts,</b> at elevated temperatures, yielding XeF4 and xenon oxyfluorides.|$|R
5|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} {{represent}} a commodity of growing importance, {{and make up}} the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals <b>react</b> with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also <b>react</b> directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{does not}} <b>react</b> with water, {{but it does}} slowly <b>react</b> with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E

50|$|The {{fatty acid}} radical {{is not a}} very stable molecule, so it <b>reacts</b> readily with {{molecular}} oxygen, thereby creating a peroxyl-fatty acid radical.
