40|$|Two analogues of verapamil, <b>ronipamil</b> and anipamil, {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to reduce arrhythmias induced by {{occlusion}} of the left anterior descending coronary artery in conscious rats. Only anipamil (50 and 150 mg kg- 1 orally) produced a statistically significant reduction in arrhythmias; it was most effective against ventricular fibrillation. <b>Ronipamil</b> at the same doses had limited antiarrhythmic actions. Only anipamil delayed the development of ECG signs of ischaemia, while both drugs reduced the magnitude of such changes. Anipamil has a more favourable ratio of antiarrhythmic to hypotensive effects when compared with verapamil...|$|E
