The experimental {{results indicated that the}} average velocity for TRM ranges between 0. 6 to 3. 5 m/s, while that of ECB varies from 0. 7 to 4. 1 m/s. Also, TRM has shear stress values of 1. 950 N/m 3 for bed and 1. 575 N/m 3 for bank respectively of test channel when the flow depth was 15 cm. While ECB has shear stresses of 2. 138 N/m 3 for bed and 1. 721 N/m 3 for bank for same flow depth of 15 cm. However, when the flow depth is 5 cm, TRM has values of 0. 972 N/m 3 for bed and 0. 769 N/m 3 for bank, and ECB gives 0. 957 N/m 3 for bed and 0. 766 N/m 3 for bank of test channel. Hence, the greater the flow depth, the higher the velocities and shear stresses respectively.

40|$|Soil erosion {{is evident}} in so many {{situations}} and the environmental impact can be significant. Contractors are the folks who most often see erosion and its effects. They are also the ones who can do the most to prevent soil erosion from happening. Installing rolled erosion control materials is generally easy, and the materials can be quite affordable. The overall costs of installation can be reduced with rolled erosion control products (RECPs) versus other conventional methods of temporary protection such as blown straw. Frequently, a blown straw mulch application needs to be repaired or replaced because of wind or water erosion of the straw. When RECPs are used instead, the additional expenses of repair and replacement are not incurred. Available hydraulic data confirms RECPs meet, and under certain conditions, can exceed the shear stress rating of rock rip rap. Some estimates indicate that installation of a turf <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mat</b> can be one-third the cost of eight-inch rock riprap for {{the same level of}} erosion control. 1 (Lancaster et. al.) In many cases RECPs can also be installed on steeper grades than rock rip rap and hard armor. Of course, a benefit of a RECP is it allows vegetation growth and provides a panoramic natural setting that is aesthetically pleasing in landscape applications. Proper installation of RECPs is critical for a successful project. Even the best products will not work properly if not installed correctly. Just how easy is the installation of erosion control materials? This article will provide directions on the ease with which rolled erosion control materials can be installed in channels.

Once failure can be predicted and anticipated fairly correctly, timely corrective measures {{can be taken}} to avert catastrophes. This way, costs would be reduced and profits maximized. Some of the difficult materials to predict the failure for are natural fibre reinforced composites {{due to the fact that}} fibres do not all fail at the same time with load value. Some fibres fail earlier than others, thereby exhibiting lesser failure values than theoretically calculated. In this research, polyester resin was reinforced with natural sisal using the hand lay-up process. Three types of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mats</b> were used. Two were handmade while one was machine made. Composites of varying sisal volume fractions were made. Pressure of 15 – 20 bar was applied to the slates for 15 minutes before allowing them to cure at room temperature for 24 hours. Pressure was applied in order to eliminate air bubbles and also to ensure an even and flat resultant surface. Test specimens from the resultant composites were subjected to three-point and four-point bending to determine the Young's modulus, E. The results revealed that E values for all the composites were lower that what was theoretically calculated from the volume fractions; the hand-made mats resulted in lower E values than the machine-made mat; it was also observed that the higher the volume fraction, the higher the E value obtained experimentally...|$|R

(KBG) were evaluated during and after 88 and 60 day dry downs in 2010 and 2011, respectively, under a rainout shelter. Changes in green coverage were evaluated with digital images. Green coverage declined slowest during dry downs and increased fastest during recoveries in the cultivar ‘Apollo’, indicating it had superior drought tolerance. Electrolyte leakage, photosynthesis, and leaf water potential were evaluated in 7 KBG cultivars {{during and after the}} dry downs. Soil moisture at 5 and 20 cm was measured. There were generally no differences in physiological parameters among cultivars during or after dry down. The highest reduction in soil moisture at 5 and 20 cm was in Apollo, suggesting it had a better developed root system for mining water from the profile during drought. Weed prevention and turfgrass establishment of ‘Legacy’ buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides [Nutt. ] Engelm.) and ‘Chisholm’ zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) grown on turf <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mats</b> (TRM) was evaluated. ‘Chisholm’ zoysiagrass stolons grew under the TRM; as such, use of TRM for this cultivar is not practical. Buffalograss had 90 % or greater coverage when established on TRM in 2010 and 65 % or greater coverage in 2011; coverage was similar to that in oxadiazon-treated plots {{at the end of each}} year. ‘Legacy’ buffalograss plugs were established on TRM over plastic for 3 weeks, stored in TRM under tree shade for 7, 14, or 21 days, and evaluated for establishment after storage.

40|$|Deterioration of bridge decks is {{a primary}} factor {{limiting}} the lifespan of bridges especially in cold climates where deicing salts are commonly used. While controlling deck cracking or decreasing the permeability and porosity of concrete can improve performance and service life, chloride and moisture ingress as well as cracking cannot be eliminated. Full-depth cracks which are caused by restrained shrinkage allow for corrosive conditions at early ages for both {{the top and bottom}} <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mats.</b> Therefore, the use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement is essential to mitigate deterioration of bridge decks. The objective of this research program is to evaluate both the structural and corrosion performance of concrete bridge decks reinforced with corrosion-resistant reinforcement. To achieve this objective, a three phase experimental investigation was conducted considering a wide range of corrosion-resistant reinforcing materials. These materials included stainless steel (316 LN, Duplex 2205, Duplex 2304, and XM- 28), MMFX II microcomposite steel, and coated steel (epoxy, hot-dip galvanized, zinc-clad, and dual-coated zinc and epoxy (Zbar)). Forty-five beam specimens with tension lap splices were tested in the first phase to evaluate the bond between corrosion-resistant reinforcement and concrete. The test data were combined with other data available in literature to construct a simple model for development and splice length considering the range of corrosion resistant bar types as well as unconfined and confined conditions. Twelve slab specimens were tested in the second phase to evaluate the cracking behavior of slabs reinforced with corrosion-resistant reinforcement. ^ Finally, one hundred twelve modified macrocells were constructed in the third phase to evaluate corrosion resistance under uncracked and cracked conditions. Transverse steel was also tied to the longitudinal steel to simulate actual bridge deck conditions. Based on the results of this study, a simple model is recommended for the calculation of development and splice lengths for both conventional black and corrosion-resistant reinforcing steel with and without confinement. Test results indicate that stainless steel, MMFX II, galvanized, and dual-coated bars have bond strengths comparable with black bars. Modification factors were developed for development and splice length calculations when other bar types are used. Recommendations are also provided for the control of crack widths. Considering corrosion resistance, identical reinforcing materials should be used in the top and bottom reinforcing mats while inert ties or ties made of the same material as the reinforcing bars should be used to avoid galvanic coupling. Finally, to assist in the selection of corrosion-resistant reinforcement, a ranking of the corrosion performance of various corrosion-resistant bars is provided based on test results and a visual examination after 503 days of exposure. ...|$|R

These materials included stainless steels, microcomposite steel, and coated steels considering a variety of metallic and nonmetallic coatings. The first phase evaluated the bond between corrosion-resistant reinforcement and concrete using lap splice tests. The second phase evaluated the cracking behavior of slabs reinforced with corrosion-resistant reinforcement. Finally, the third phase evaluated corrosion resistance under uncracked and cracked conditions using macrocell test specimens. Transverse steel was also tied to the longitudinal steel to simulate actual bridge deck conditions. Recommendations are provided on development and splice lengths for both conventional black and corrosion-resistant reinforcing steel, control of cracks widths, as well as the selection, design, and construction of corrosion-resistant reinforcement. For the economic evaluation (Volume II), a decision support methodology and associated spreadsheet tool for robust analysis of the cost-effectiveness of alternative material types for bridge deck reinforcement was developed. The two evaluation criteria are agency and user costs, and the input data that influence this criteria include the deck service life, material process, discount rate, detour length, and bridge size. The methodology incorporates analytical techniques that include life cycle analyses to evaluate the long-term cost and benefits of each material over the bridge life; Monte Carlo simulation to account for the probabilistic nature of the input variables; stochastic dominance to ascertain the probability distribution of the outcome that a specific reinforcement material is superior to others; and analytical hierarchical process to establish appropriate weights for the agency and user costs. The study methodology is demonstrated using a case study involving three reinforcement material alternatives: traditional (epoxy-coated) steel, zinc-clad steel, and stainless steel. Through this study, it is demonstrated that the use of corrosion-resistant reinforcing materials can significantly increase bridge deck life, reduce agency and user costs associated with bridge deck rehabilitation and maintenance, and thus lower the financial needs for long-term preservation of bridges...|$|R

40|$|The {{materials}} {{under consideration}} in the present research are a glass fibre reinforced PU-foam sandwich structure and its constituents. These constituents are: a flexible open cell PU-foam, a rigid closed cell PU-foam and a continuous glass fibre mat. The general goal {{of this research is}} to build different tools to analyse and predict the mechanical properties of the constituents and the final sandwich structure. Therefore, this research combines experimental work with numerical modelling techniques. The first part of this dissertation discusses the open cell PU-foam. Although the open cell foam is not the main load carrying material in the sandwich panel, characterizing and modelling it is of great importance in other research areas (e. g. surface functionalization or pressure drop calculations). The cellular structure of this foam is characterized by means of optical microscopy, SEM and CT. Based on the outcome of the experimental observations, the Kelvin cell and Weaire-Phelan structure were selected as RVE for the FE-modelling. Up to now, the use of the latter structure to build a FE-model has not been reported in literature. In correspondence to real foams, the material distribution in the cell edges of the RVE based FE-models is completely governed by a minimization of the surface energy. The influence of the cell size, solid PU material stiffness, relative density and shape anisotropy on the mechanical properties of the open cell foam, is investigated by means of these models. The Weaire-Phelan based FE-model proved to represent and predict the mechanical properties of the open cell foam in a better way than the standard Kelvin cell based FE-model. In order to decrease the large spread on the available data regarding the solid PU stiffness, special attention is given to this parameter. The skins of the investigated sandwich structures consist of a GF/PU-foam composite. Because the skins are formed in situ, they cannot be characterized in advance which hinders a pre-production prediction of the mechanical properties of the sandwich panel. Therefore, X-ray CT-imaging combined with image processing algorithms are used in the current study to determine the skin thickness and fibre orientation distribution function. This allows to calculate the stiffness of the skins based on the rules of mixture and the Mori-Tanaka inclusion model. The resulting data were successfully validated by experimental work. In the final part of this research the knowledge on the stiffness of PU-foam core and GF/PU-foam composite skin is joined into a simple calculation tool to predict the bending stiffness of the sandwich panels. A comparison of the calculated values to experimental stiffness data, measured on industrially produced plated, revealed an accuracy of +/- 10 %. Moreover, the influence of different parameters like the weight and orientation of the applied fibre <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mats</b> is indicated by this tool and allows to identify directions for future material developments. nrpages: 256 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} finite-element {{predictions for}} {{the strength of}} a pultruded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) material subjected to pin-bearing loading with hole clearance. One of the distinct modes of failure in steel bolted connections is bearing. It is caused by the compression action from the shaft pressing into the laminate, and when there is no lateral restraint the mechanism observed at maximum load shows brooming for delamination failure. Each lamina in the glass fiber polyester matrix material is modeled as a homogeneous, anisotropic continuum and a relatively very thin resin layer is assumed to contain any delamination cracking between stacked layers. A cohesive zone model is implemented to predict the size and location of the initial delamination, as well as the load-carrying capacity in a pin-bearing specimen. Finite-element simulations (as virtual tests) are performed at the mesoscale level to validate the modeling methodology against experimental strength test results with delamination failure, and to show how pin-bearing strength varies with parameter changes.

Working with polymeric matrix materials is known {{in the area of}} glass-mat reinforced thermoplastics (GMT). The disadvan-tage of the first named technologies are their long cycle times for part produc-tion. The other process deals with problems like impregnation, high pressures for pressing and forming of the sheet and high temperatures to melt the ther-moplastic material {{as a consequence of the}} high melt viscosity.

For the laminate loading was aligned with a fibre direction. For the ply the loading was inclined to the fibres (off-axis). Testing to stress levels up to 200 and temperatures in the range 20 °- 200 °C has revealed a form of creep in each material. The creep observed is essentially primary in nature but with extended time • 1000 h, it may exhaust or resemble a pseudo-secondary regime with a low rate. Where the load carrying capacity is lost, through fibre breakage or tab slip, the creep rate accelerates suddenly to infinity in a few hours. Smooth creep curves apply to successful tests but many irregular curves resulted from grip failure. A phenomenological approach was used to model smooth curves using a summation of instantaneous, primary and secondary strain terms. For the <b>mat</b> <b>reinforcement</b> a consistent trend was not found between the secondary creep rate and a stress that was raised incrementally upon the same testpiece. However the cumulative instantaneous strain provided the correct elastic modulus. Creep in the solid laminate {{was believed to be}} due to a fibre straightening that yielded a limiting strain in a time beyond which the process exhausts. Creep in cfrc was only evident when the fibres were inclined to the stress axis, indicating a viscous flow in the matrix.

To achieve these objectives, an experimental program was carried out, in which a small-scale RC slab was subjected to wet and dry cycles with a saturated chloride solution while sustaining static service loads. The concrete slab was cast with three strips of different water-to-cement ratios to represent different field conditions. Supports were located to create both positive and negative moment regions in the top <b>mat</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of the slab. Concrete cores were taken at several sections along the RC deck, which were stressed to different levels, and at three time intervals, each of them after a wet/dry cycle of 90 days. Concrete cores were sprayed with a AgNO 3 solution to determine an average chloride penetration front, and chloride profiles along the concrete cover for each core were measured by potentiometric titration. Chloride diffusion coefficients were obtained from the data obtained from spraying AgNO 3 and titration, the latter by curve-fitting to Fick's 2 nd law. The comparison between both sets of data reveals that the differences diminish as the time of exposure increases. The chloride diffusivity along the span of the slab, relative to that of an unstressed section, was related to the applied bending moment. The experimental results also indicate that there is a dependence of chloride ingress properties on the type and level of sustained load. An analysis of the data to study the effect of exposure time and water-to-cement ratio using colourimetric and potentiometric titration methods was also carried out...|$|R
