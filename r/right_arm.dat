5|$|Nine days later, {{he checked}} into Methodist Hospital in Houston {{for a series}} of {{physical}} and psychological tests to determine the cause of his mysterious arm problems. An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and axillary arteries of the <b>right</b> <b>arm.</b> Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.|$|E
5|$|Holly then {{underwent}} several surgeries {{to repair}} nagging injuries. He was hospitalized after a staph infection {{developed in a}} <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> wound. The infection was possibly career-threatening, as doctors were worried {{at one point that}} the arm may have to undergo amputation. The subsequent treatments were a success, however.|$|E

5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} pictured with four arms in South Indian iconography. The front <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> is {{stretched}} out downwards {{and the hand}} holds a bit of grass or another plant in the kataka gesture, {{near the mouth of}} his pet deer or antelope, who leaps playfully by his side. The back <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> is raised and holds a damaru (drum). The front left hand holds a kapala (skull-cup), used as a begging bowl. The back left hand holds a trishula decorated with peacock feathers. The left leg is firmly rooted in the ground while the right one is slightly bent, suggesting walking. He often wears paduka (wooden sandals) but sometimes may be barefoot. The sandals are unique and identifying feature of Bhikshatana's iconography and distinguish him from other forms of Shiva and all other deities, who are always depicted barefoot. Sometimes Bhikshatana's iconography is amalgamated with that of Bhairava, in which case he displays Bhairava's attributes in addition to his own.|$|E

5|$|During the match, she {{was knocked}} onto her right side, and her <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> became trapped {{underneath}} her wheelchair, causing a tendon in her elbow to rupture. Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down {{tried to block}} the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow. Because she had a pre-existing condition, the insurance company refused {{to pay for her}} treatment, although it paid her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot of anger towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use of an electric wheelchair because of the severity of her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.|$|E
5|$|In 1820, Isaac Shelby was {{stricken}} with paralysis in his <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> and leg. He {{died of a}} stroke on July 18, 1826, {{at his home in}} Lincoln County. He was buried on the grounds of his estate, Traveller's Rest. The state erected a monument over his grave in 1827. In 1952 the Shelby family cemetery was given to the state government and became the Isaac Shelby Cemetery State Historic Site.|$|E
5|$|Megaera– The {{first of}} the three Furies, she was {{ruthless}} in her punishment and accidentally facilitated Kratos' freedom from his imprisonment. Despite her best efforts of having Aegaeon's infected parts destroy Kratos, the Spartan overcame the brute and killed Megaera. In a flashback two weeks prior, Kratos cut off her <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> in a battle in Delos, which also involved Tisiphone, and facilitated in Kratos' capture. The character was voiced by Nika Futterman.|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} modelling of parametric rolling {{of a ship}} advancing in longitudinal waves is studied on {{an experimental}} basis. Different descriptions of the <b>righting</b> <b>arm</b> in waves are compared with experimental results using a perturbative analytical solution obtained {{by means of the}} averaging method. It appears that an isolated roll motion equation provides a very reliable simulation of experimental results including both threshold and roll amplitude above threshold, but the interaction between <b>righting</b> <b>arm</b> nonlinearity and time dependence induced by wave and vertical motions requires further studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of wave profile on ship <b>righting</b> <b>arm</b> {{is among the}} possible stability failure issues addressed by the recent activity at IMO. The present paper is mainly focused on the so called “pure loss of stability”, a dangerous phenomenon that can occur for specific conditions in following seas. In the paper, {{the development of a}} computational tool is described, able to evaluate the {{influence of}} wave profile on ship metacentric height and <b>righting</b> <b>arms,</b> giving the possibility to investigate different ship geometries and loading conditions in relation with wave profiles in terms of different lengths and steepness. The tool is applied to several ship typologies and a special attention in the investigations is given to transversal metacentric height GM and to the maximum <b>righting</b> <b>arm</b> GZmax since, in some proposals, these are the parameters assumed as indicative while performing first and second level vulnerability analysis for pure loss of stability...|$|R
50|$|Set in a dystopian future, {{the world}} has been ravaged by a {{biological}} disease that transforms humans into monsters called the Kamiyadori. The <b>Right</b> <b>Arms</b> is a military peacekeeping group whose members have been infected with a strain of the virus, granting them superhuman strength. To prevent the spread of the virulent disease, all the people that are infected by the disease have to be executed.

5|$|Petry {{placed a}} {{tourniquet}} on his <b>right</b> <b>arm.</b> Roberts began to {{fire at the}} Taliban fighters, suppressing them in the courtyard. An additional fighter on {{the east end of}} the courtyard fired, fatally wounding Gathercole. Higgins and Robinson returned fire, killing that fighter. They were joined by Sergeant First Class Jerod Staidle, the platoon sergeant, and Specialist Gary Depriest, a medic. Directing the medic to treat Gathercole, Petry was assisted by Staide and Higgins to the casualty collection point.|$|E

Ten years after he was acquitted in the murder trial, he was found dead in a hotel room with a gunshot wound to the head. Authorities could not definitively rule out either suicide or murder.|$|E
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} the {{painting}} {{can be attributed to}} an antique sardonyx cameo and a 15th-century relief from the circle of Donatello, available to Michelangelo in the Palazzo Medici: the circular form, the masculinity of Mary, and the positioning of the Christ Child. The Virgin’s <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> mirrors the arm of the satyr in the cameo, and the cameo also depicts an infant located on the shoulders of the satyr, a position similar to the Christ Child on Mary’s shoulders.|$|E

5|$|Banks was {{determined}} to break the siege by a direct assault on the Confederate lines. Dow believed the attack to be a mistake, and delayed his units' participation until later in the day. In the assault, which was unsuccessful, Dow {{was wounded in the}} <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> and left thigh and sent to a nearby plantation to convalesce. While in the hospital, he lobbied for a transfer to a theater where his chances of promotion would be greater. On June 30, having healed enough to mount a horse again, Dow visited his troops. As he returned to the hospital after dark, he was captured by Confederate cavalry operating behind Union lines.|$|E
5|$|Born in Castlemaine, Victoria, Peeler {{worked at}} various jobs {{in his home}} town and in the Melbourne area before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in February 1916. Posted to the 3rd Pioneer Battalion, he arrived on the Western Front during November. In June 1917, his {{battalion}} participated in the assault on Messines ridge, where he was lightly wounded. Eight days after his Victoria Cross action, Peeler was severely wounded in his <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> {{and spent the next}} seven months recuperating in the United Kingdom. Following the armistice with Germany, he was discharged from service with the rank of sergeant in December 1918.|$|E
5|$|Brian Charles Booth (born 19 October 1933) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who played in 29 Tests from 1961 to 1966, and 93 {{first-class}} matches for New South Wales. He captained Australia for two Tests during the 196566 Ashes series while regular captain Bob Simpson was absent due to illness and injury. Booth was a graceful right-handed middle order batsman at No. 4 or 5, and occasionally bowled <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> medium pace or off spin. He had an inclination to use his feet to charge spin bowlers. Booth {{was known for his}} sportsmanship on the field and often invoked Christianity while discussing ethics and sport.|$|E

5|$|Embarking for the Western Front, the 12th Battalion {{joined the}} British Expeditionary Force upon arrival in France on 7 April 1916. Eight days later, Whittle was {{promoted}} to lance sergeant. Posted to the Fleurbaix sector of France, the 12th Battalion was engaged in minor operations until July. During this time, Whittle was wounded on 18 June, suffering a gunshot wound to his <b>right</b> <b>arm.</b> Initially admitted to the 3rd Field Ambulance, the injury necessitated treatment in England and Whittle {{was transferred to the}} 1st Auxiliary Hospital, Harefield.

5|$|Krueger came to {{feel that}} the {{prospects}} for promotion in the infantry were very poor, and in 1927 he tried to transfer to the United States Army Air Corps. He attended the Air Corps Primary Flying School at Brooks Field, Texas, but suffered an attack of neuritis in his <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> and his flight instructor, Lieutenant Claire Lee Chennault, failed him. In December 1927, he was offered a position as an instructor at the Naval War College, where he taught classes on World War I, and on joint operations.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{suffered}} a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge, New Jersey home. A blood clot {{resulting from the}} atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> or leg. Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma. He died at 9:08p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.|$|E
