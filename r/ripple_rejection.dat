50|$|More complex {{arrangements}} are possible; the filter {{can be an}} LC ladder rather than a simple choke or the filter and the reservoir capacitor can both be used to gain the benefits of both. The most commonly seen of these is a low-pass Π-filter consisting of a reservoir capacitor followed by a series choke followed by a further shunt capacitor. However, use of chokes is deprecated in contemporary designs for economic reasons. A more common solution where good <b>ripple</b> <b>rejection</b> is required {{is to use a}} reservoir capacitor to reduce the ripple to something manageable and then pass through a voltage regulator circuit. The regulator circuit, as well as regulating the output, will incidentally filter out nearly all of the ripple as long as the minimum level of the ripple waveform does not go below the voltage being regulated to.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{improved}} droop control strategy is proposed. The droop method allows inverter interfaced power units to independently feed loads according to variables measured {{only at the}} inverter connection point. The conventional droop method is however affected by an inherent issue regarding the power measurement {{that is necessary to}} deviate frequency and voltage magnitude in order to reach optimal power sharing. The conventional power measurement strategy is often based on a first order low pass filter. This implies a trade-off between a suitable power <b>ripple</b> <b>rejection</b> and the bandwidth limitation on the overall control scheme due to the inherent low frequency pole. In this paper a different filtering scheme is proposed and investigated through an analytical approach. A comparison between the conventional and the proposed control schemes is discussed through a detailed analysis. A case study of a microgrid fed by two inverters is also presented to show the improvements in dynamic performances using the proposed control architecture...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} {{increase}} the parasitic input resistance caused by application of chopper modulation to indirect current feedback instrumentation amplifiers. The result is obtained by applying dynamic element matching to the input and feedback ports at the same frequency as chopper modulation.

40|$|A biopotential {{acquisition}} {{analog front-end}} (AFE) integrated circuit (IC) is presented. The biopotential AFE includes a capacitively coupled chopper instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) to achieve low input referred noise (IRN) and to block unwanted DC potential signals. A DC servo loop (DSL) {{is designed to}} minimize the offset voltage in the chopper amplifier and low frequency respiration artifacts. An AC coupled <b>ripple</b> <b>rejection</b> loop (RRL) is employed to reduce ripple due to chopper stabilization. A capacitive impedance boosting loop (CIBL) is designed to enhance the input impedance and common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) without additional power consumption, even under an external electrode mismatch. The AFE IC consists of two-stage CCIA that include three compensation loops (DSL, RRL, and CIBL) at each CCIA stage. The biopotential AFE is fabricated using a 0. 18 μm one polysilicon and six metal layers (1 P 6 M) {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) process. The core chip size of the AFE without input/output (I/O) pads is 10. 5 mm 2.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} design of a smart {{photovoltaic}} (PV) module- a PV module in which PV cells in close proximity are electrically grouped to form a pixel and are connected to dc-dc converter blocks which reside embedded in the back pane of the module. An auto-connected flyback converter topology processing less than full power is used to provide high gain and perform maximum power point tracking (MPPT). These dc-dc converters interface with cascaded H-bridge inverter modules operating on feed forward control for dc-link voltage <b>ripple</b> <b>rejection.</b> By means of feed forward control, a significant reduction in dc link capacitance is achieved by enduring higher dc link ripple voltages. The dc link electrolytic capacitors are replaced with film capacitors thus offering an improvement in the reliability of the smart PV module. The proposed configuration is capable of producing 120 V/ 240 V AC voltage. The PV module now becomes a smart AC module by virtue of embedded intelligence to selectively actuate the individual dc-dc converters and control the output AC voltages directly, thus becoming a true plug and power energy system. Such a concept is ideal for curved surfaces such as building integrated PV (BIPV) system applications where gradients of insolation and temperature cause not only variations from PV module-to-PV module but from group-to-group of cells within the module itself.

40|$|Peace {{and quiet}} ’ is a scarce {{commodity}} in our lives, {{and with the}} relentless demand for highly integrated, low cost mixed-signal system-on-chip (SoC) solutions [1], it is even less frequent in integrated circuits (ICs). Densely populated SoC environments are plagued with broad-spectrum noise generated from low and high frequency digital, radio frequency (RF), and switching power supply circuits, reaching hundreds of milli-volts and extending from several thousand to a few giga-Hertz [3]. As power supplies drive these rapidly changing loads, noise is created in the supply busses and therefore propagated throughout the chip. It creates jitter and generally deteriorates the dynamic range and spectral fidelity of sensitive analog functions like data converters, phase-locked loops (PLLs), voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), and the like [3 - 6], which is how and why linear regulators have come to amass so much demand. Linear regulators, among other things, are tasked with shielding sensitive analog blocks from noise in the supplies, making wide-spectrum power supply <b>ripple</b> <b>rejection</b> (PSRR) a vital specification parameter. In broad terms, {{the function of the}} regulator is to generate an independent supply voltage through a series-shunt feedback network. Figure 1 illustrates the basic architecture of a low dropout (LDO) linear regulator whose added function is to sustain low input-output voltage differentials, which is critical, for instance, in low voltage, battery-supplied applications. Shunt feedback is accomplished by sensing the output voltage through the R 1 -R 2 feedback network, comparing it against a stable voltage reference, and generating a corresponding error-control signal to a pass device via an error amplifier. In essence, the feedback control signal will {{do whatever it takes to}} ensure the output voltage is close to the reference, and how close is determined by the loop gain (Aolβ) of the circuit...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A 64 -site {{wireless}} current microstimulator chip (Interestim- 2 B) and {{a prototype}} implant {{based on the}} same chip have been developed for neural prosthetic applications. Modular standalone architecture allows up to 32 chips to be individually addressed and operated in parallel to drive up to 2048 stimulating sites. The only off-chip components are a receiver inductive-capac-itive (LC) tank, a capacitive low-pass filter for <b>ripple</b> <b>rejection,</b> and arrays of microelectrodes for interfacing with the neural tissue. The implant receives inductive power up to 50 mW and data at 2. 5 Mb/s from a frequency shift keyed (FSK) 5 / 10 MHZ carrier to generate up to 65 800 stimulus pulses/s. Each Interestim- 2 B chip contains 16 current drivers with 270 A full-scale current, 5 -bit (32 -steps) digital-to-analog converter (DAC) resolution, 100 M output impedance, and a voltage compliance that extends within 150 and 250 mV of the 5 V supply and ground rails, respectively. It can generate any arbitrary current waveform and supports a variety of monopolar and bipolar stimulation protocols. A common analog line provides access to each site potential, and exhausts residual stimulus charges for charge balancing. The chip has site potential measurement and in situ site impedance measurement capabilities, which help its users indicate defective sites or characteristic shifts in chronic stimulations.

40|$|Bandgap {{reference}} circuits {{are used}} {{in a host of}} analog, digital, and mixed-signal systems to establish an accurate voltage standard for the entire IC. The accuracy of the bandgap reference voltage under steady-state (dc) and transient (ac) conditions is critical to obtain high system performance. In this work, the impact of process, power-supply, load, and temperature variations and package stresses on the dc and ac accuracy of bandgap reference circuits has been analyzed. Based on this analysis, the a bandgap reference that 1. has high dc accuracy despite process and temperature variations and package stresses, without resorting to expensive trimming or noisy switching schemes, 2. has high dc and ac accuracy despite power-supply variations, without using large off-chip capacitors that increase bill-of-material costs, 3. has high dc and ac accuracy despite load variations, without resorting to error-inducing buffers, 4. is capable of producing a sub-bandgap reference voltage with a low power-supply, to enable it to operate in modern, battery-operated portable applications, 5. utilizes a standard CMOS process, to lower manufacturing costs, and 6. is integrated, to consume less board space has been proposed. The functionality of critical components of the system has been verified through prototypes after which the performance of the complete system has been evaluated by integrating all the individual components on an IC.

40|$|Finally, the PSRR {{performance}} of LDO is studied. An energy-efficient embedded ripple feed-forward path is {{proposed to improve}} the PSRR of LDO. Comparing with some state-of-the-art techniques for PSRR improvement, the proposed LDO features very simple structure thus low-power consumption. A LDO implemented in 0. 18 -mum CMOS technology with 0. 042 -mm 2 active area {{has been designed to}} verify the idea. With an external 4. 7 -muF output capacitor, in the maximum load condition (i. e. at 25 mA), the PSRR is - 77 dB at 1 MHz, - 85 dB at 2. 5 MHz and - 55 dB at 5 MHz, respectively. The quiescent current is 15 muA only, while the transient voltage overshoot or undershoot is less than 40 mV when load current changes between 1 mA and 25 mA with 40 -ns step time. The LDO achieves good line and load regulations of 3 mV/V and 50 muV/mA, respectively. Remotely- or battery-powered wireless system-on-a-chip (SoC) needs energy-efficient and high-integration power-management solutions due to their energy-aware characteristics. Low-dropout regulator (LDO) is a good solution because of its excellent performances such as low power consumption, fast load-transient response and high power-supply <b>ripple</b> <b>rejection</b> (PSRR). Moreover, it is easy to be fully integrated since no inductor is needed to be the energy-storage element. Recent development of output-capacitorless LDO (OCL-LDO) realizes on-chip, local voltage regulation to enable more effective integrated power management for SoC. In this thesis, OCL-LDOs with low power consumption and fast load-transient response are investigated and presented in this thesis. LDO with output capacitor for high-PSRR operation to provide clean power supply to RF circuits is also reported. Three LDOs are developed and fabricated to verify the proposed ideas. The first design is an ultra low-power voltage regulator for remotely powered energy-autonomous devices. It has been fabricated in a commercial 0. 18 -mum CMOS technology and applied to a passive UHF RFID tag IC. With the low-power voltage reference circuit and sub-threshold operations, the total quiescent current is 700 nA under a 1. 8 -V power supply. The output voltage of the regulator is 1. 45 V with load capability of 50 muA. The temperature coefficients of the voltage reference and the output voltage are only 9 and 43 ppm/°C, respectively. A POR signal with 150 -ns-width pulse is also generated to reset the digital processing part in the tag IC. The second design is a fast-transient OCL-LDO, which has been implemented in a commercial 90 -nm CMOS technology. Experimental result verifies that it is stable for a capacitive load from 0 to 50 pF and with load capability of 100 rnA. Moreover, the gain-enhanced structure provides sufficient loop gain to improve line regulation to 3. 78 mV/V and load regulation to 0. 1 mV/mA, respectively. The embedded voltage-spike detection circuit enables pseudo Class-AB operation to drive the power transistor promptly. The maximum overshoot and undershoot under a 1. 2 -V supply are less than 66 mV for full load current changes within 100 -ns edge time, and the recovery time is less than 5 mus. While the measured power consumption is only 6 muW under a 0. 75 -V supply. Guo, Jianping. Adviser: Ka Nang Leung. Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 73 - 06, Section: B, page:.
