50|$|Ben Lomond National Park protects a {{representative}} cross-section of Tasmania's north-east alpine plant communities. Although {{much of the}} plateau is stony with areas of low and often stunted forms of vegetation, {{the remainder of the}} mountain contains a wide variety of habitats ranging from alpine moorland to dense forest. A total of 222 plant species have been recorded on the Ben Lomond plateau, represented by 152 dicotyledons, 62 monocotyledons, 1 gymnosperm and 7 fern and fern ally families. The five most common families (Asteraceae, Poaceae, Epacridaceae, Cyperaceae and Proteaceae) account for about half the total number of species recorded. Most families, however, are only represented by one or two species. Some introduced plants have naturalised on the plateau from introduced grasses, clovers and straw used to stabilise soil and revegetate areas affected by slope grooming, road works and other site disturbances. The most common native species recorded on the plateau are the herbs Poa gunnii (tussock grass) and Gentianella diemensis, the shrubs, Richea scoparia, Orites acicularis and Pentachondra pumila, Baeckea gunniana and Epacris serpyllifolia. Cushion plants are abundant throughout the plateau. One species, the <b>rock</b> <b>cushion</b> plant Chionohebe ciliolata, is known only from a small localised area within the Park. Other rare and threatened species include the rare endemic Oreomyrrhis sessiliflora, and the endangered Colobanthus curtisiae.|$|E
40|$|Crown {{of thorns}} starfish (Acanthaster planci Linné 1758) are notorious coral reef devastators; they decimate coral populations, thus {{changing}} the coral reef habitat and killing many organisms {{that depend on}} the coral. Culcita novaeguineae (Muller and Troschel 1842), or cushion stars, are corallivores and generalists that live in Pacific reefs. Because C. novaeguineae and A. planci have similar food preferences, the presence of crown of thorns may change cushion stars’ eating habits. This study explored cushion star ecology and their laboratory feeding preferences in the presence and absence of crown of thorns. Laboratory experiments were conducted with three coral food choices (Porites sp., Acropora sp., and Monopora sp.) and algae covered <b>rock.</b> <b>Cushion</b> stars only ate Acropora sp. and Monopora sp. in laboratory experiments. They found among {{all three of those}} coral genera in the field and were rarely found near Pocillopora sp. Crown of thorns presence had no significant impact on the food choice in the lab or substrate choice of cushion stars in the field. General laboratory trends indicate cushion stars ate more frequently and preferred rock as substrate in the presence of crown of thorns...|$|E

These days occupy territories that they defend against other males. The defense consists mostly in threatening gestures. For this they spread their wings and put them on display so clearly visible, there is also Drohflügen and in rare cases to air combat between rival males. Optimal areas correspond to the optimal nesting places for the females and are characterized by a normally increased flow and a suitable oviposition substrate in the potential breeding sites from. The size of the spots and their distance apart is the density of the population dependent as well as the occurrences of the water and may be between several meters and a few decimetres. Males who do not occupy spots can keep themselves in the vegetation on the shore and try to mate with fly to females or to fill vacant spots. Especially when only a few males are present, the territorial defense is very aggressive, with a higher number of competing male aggression but decreases significantly.The males sit in their areas mostly in exposed places in the vegetation, which extends over the water, sometimes on vegetation or <b>rocks</b> <b>cushions</b> amid the waters.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rockfalls {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{prevailing}} natural hazards in the mountainous regions in Switzer-land. Concrete protection galleries are used to protect the local infrastructure and lifelines against these poten-tial <b>rock</b> impacts. <b>Cushion</b> materials are laid on these galleries to absorb the rockfall impact energy, which is one of the main input parameters in the design of the protection gallery. An attempt has been made to reduce the impact energies by placing a better damping material on the gallery. The high rock impact energy ranges are difficult to model at the laboratory scale. Field tests are generally avoided due to the high costs involved and also due to the singularity of the potential tests. The prototype energy levels can be achieved at the labo-ratory scale with the help of a geotechnical centrifuge. An instrumented model of the protection gallery is ro-tated under high g levels, thereby increasing the unit weight of the material. With the help of appropriate scal-ing laws, the prototype energy levels can be achieved. This paper focuses on the determination of the impact force of a rockfall of a specific energy and the forces induced in the gallery. The maximum acceleration val-ues of the rock and deflection of the galleries are compared for different energy ranges and cushion materials. The test results are later compared with numerical modelling using the finite element program LS-DYNA. ...|$|R
40|$|Rock shed {{is widely}} used in traffic lines against {{rockfall}}. In order to cushion rockfall impact and dissipate impact energy, cushion layer is usually adopted in rock shed. Used tire cushion layer is proposed in this paper and it can cushion rockfall impact utilizing large radial deformation of tire. Reinforced concrete structure model is built with used tire cushion layer and artificial rockfall test is carried out. Twelve tests are divided into 4 sets with different rockfall mass, rockfall height, and tire filling material. Simplified calculation model with spring-damper is derived from radial repeated compression test of used tire, which improves the calculation efficiency. Test and numerical simulation show that application of used tire <b>cushion</b> layer in <b>rock</b> shed can <b>cushion</b> rockfall impact and effectively reduce peak acceleration and the maximum impact force. Filling sand and gravel in tire can improve tire stiffness and energy absorption capacity but will decrease cushion effect due to its large density. With the same impact energy, light rockfall is more destructive than weight rockfall for used tire cushion layer...|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} impact force by <b>rock</b> falling, sand <b>cushion</b> with 90 cm height is {{commonly}} used {{on the roof of}} rock-shed. The impact force in this case is usually evaluated by the conventional equation which is derived based on Hertz 2 ̆ 7 s contact theory. However, according to the analytical results by one-dimensinal and/or axisymmetric wave theory, the transmitted impact force to rigid base is to be twice of the inputed one. In this paper, to get the real impact force caused by rock falling, the large field test on heavy weight falling on sand cushion is performed. The heavy weights of 2 and 3 tf weight are used and they are dropped from a maximum 30 m height. Measuring weight acceleration and transmitted stresses on the rigid base, two kind of impact force are estimated which are obtained from weight acceleration and summing up the transmitted stresses. From the results, it has been shows that 1) the maximum transmitted impact force may become the twice of one obtained from dropped weight, 2) the maximum transmitted impact force can be estimated using the conventional equation assuming Lame 2 ̆ 7 s constant λ = 1000 tf/m^ 2...|$|R
