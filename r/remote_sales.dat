Results. Current legislation restricts the <b>remote</b> drug <b>sale,</b> thus functioning of full-scale Internet pharmacies in the Russian Federation is not possible. Most pharmacists are not aware of the legitimacy of online pharmacies, legality of home and work delivery of drugs, purchased in the online pharmacy, and are not familiar with the existing documents regulating the activities of online pharmacies.

40|$|The {{physical}} presence standard for <b>remote</b> <b>sales</b> tax collection, established in 1967, remains {{the standard for}} sales tax collection today. Advances in technology have led to increases in online shopping. Online retailers act under the {{physical presence}} standard. Throughout the United States, many individual states are facing economic challenges either {{as a result of}} or in conjunction with states’ inability to collect sales tax from some online vendors without a physical presence in the state. The challenges include loss of revenue due to uncollected online sales tax and lack of fairness for brick-and-mortar retailers that do remit sales tax to the state and for less affluent citizens unable to shop online. In order to combat these challenges, some states are redefining and expanding the meaning of physical presence in what are known as state “Amazon laws. ” New York and Georgia took this approach. At the federal level, the U. S. Senate’s 2013 Marketplace Fairness Act attempted to enable states to collect online sales tax through origin sourcing, which does not redefine the physical presence standard. The U. S. House Judiciary Committee is currently working on alternatives to the Marketplace Fairness Act that accomplish the same goal of allowing states to collect <b>remote</b> <b>sales</b> tax without expanding the physical presence standard.

Census' new e-commerce estimates do not provide a basis for revising the results GAO found in its 2000 report. Census' definition of e-commerce is broader than Internet sales.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 55 - 57) "July 2006. "Transmitting real-time audio {{or video}} applications over the Internet {{is a challenge}} in the current technology. The motivation for deploying this technology is the reduction in voice communication overheads and the enhancement of services. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) provides improved features like flexible call routing, unified messaging and call center and network multimedia applications which in turn provide reduced costs and improvised services for distance learning, customer support, and <b>remote</b> <b>sales</b> presentations. The integration of voice, video, and data encounters a variable amount of jitter and delay. Typical packet loss ranges from 0 to 20 percent and one-way delay from 5 to 500 milliseconds. Reducing jitter delay involves buffering of audio packets at the receiver so that the slower packets arrive sequentially on time at the destination. Adaptive jitter buffering at the receiver improves the quality of voice connections on the Internet. In this thesis, the existing jitter buffer model was further enhanced by proposing a model to change the codecs from a higher bit rate to a lower bit rate during an established call session thus reducing the packet loss and improving the call performance. A simulation model is shown to support this proposal, leading {{to the development of}} a new protocol.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{challenges}} and implications related to the integration of low-income customers into the strategy of CEMEX, one of the world's largest building materials companies. Design/methodology/approach – A case study with data from interviews of a wide variety of stakeholders as well as observation and review of company documents. Findings – Construmex was launched following CEMEX's experience with Patrimonio Hoy, a socially minded business targeted at low-income families. Since its inception in 2001, Construmex helped more than 14, 000 Mexican migrants in the USA improve, build or buy a house for themselves or their families in Mexico. Through a comprehensive value proposition, Construmex provided access to <b>remote</b> <b>Sales,</b> micro-credit and professional design and planning assistance. Practical implications – Among early barriers was an initial overconfident approach from the company, as well as a low level of trust from potential clients. The program's success was possible through the establishment of key partnerships. By playing an intermediary role between migrants and their beneficiaries in Mexico, Construmex helped to increase the resource efficiency and effectiveness of housing investments. Migrants gained control of the destination of their money and saved time and resources. Among unsolved challenges was the need to reach a larger scale and financial sustainability. Opportunities to strengthen impacts were related to improved engagement of salespersons, local distributors and beneficiaries. Originality/value – The case provides insights on how a low-income market can be integrated to the business strategy of a large company resulting in the creation of social and business value.
