One of his first products was the mini condenser (an old name for capacitor). Mini condensers were commonly used in <b>radio</b> applications for <b>noise</b> <b>filtering,</b> signal coupling and tone controls. Early capacitors were two pieces of metal foil wrapped between wax paper or any other type of suitable insulation material. The type of insulating material determined the capacitor's storage capacity (measured in Farads) and the voltage tolerated. Wire leads from the capacitor connect to each metal foil. Capacitors were also useful in high power applications like motors, and soon Sprague turned his attention those areas as well.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> is to {{preserve}} features such as edge or corners, and to reduce noise. However, it is dif-ficult to preserve them after <b>noise</b> <b>filtering,</b> because most of <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> algorithms have the characteristic of low pass filter, which results {{in the loss of}} signal components with high frequencies like edge or corners. <b>Noise</b> <b>filtering</b> methods using diffusion equation try to solve this problem, and improve it to some extent. Edge detector has been used in filtering methods with diffusion equation to determine the speed of diffusion term, so the performance of them depends on the edge detection algorithm to some extent. Previous <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> approaches of diffusion equation use a simple gradient edge detector to determine the speed of diffusion. Also, each channel of color images are filtered separately, which result in the filtered image with distortion or blurring. In this paper, we propose a new <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> method for color images using diffusion equation and edge map esti-mated with K-means clustering algorithm together. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>filters</b> are {{preprocessing}} techniques {{designed to}} improve data quality in classification tasks by detecting and eliminating examples that contain errors or <b>noise.</b> However, <b>filtering</b> can also remove correct examples and examples containing valuable information, which could be useful for learning. This fact usually implies a margin of improvement on the noise detection accuracy for almost any <b>noise</b> <b>filter.</b> This paper proposes a scheme to improve the performance of <b>noise</b> <b>filters</b> in multi-class classification problems, based on decomposing the dataset into multiple binary subproblems. Decomposition strategies {{have proven to be}} successful in improving classification performance in multi-class problems by generating simpler binary subproblems. Similarly, we adapt the principles of the One-vs-One decomposition strategy to <b>noise</b> <b>filtering,</b> making the <b>noise</b> identification process simpler. In order to integrate the filtering results achieved in the binary subproblems, our proposal uses a soft voting approach considering a reliability level based on the aggregation of the noise degree prediction calculated for each binary classifier. The experimental results show that the One-vs-One decomposition strategy usually increases the performance of the <b>noise</b> <b>filters</b> studied, which can detect more accurately the noisy examples.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, <b>noise</b> <b>filter</b> {{of image}} {{processing}} {{have been widely}} used in automated manufacturing processes in noisy environment, such as removal of noise in arc welding process, because such filters are robust even in the presence of extreme noise. Since arc, soot and splash etc., salt noise which has certain noise amplitude at random location was found in captured image. It is important to employ a <b>noise</b> <b>filter</b> to intensify the laser lines and ultimately remove or reduce the noise. In this study, the welding seam image captured from the CCD camera was processed by <b>noise</b> <b>filters</b> to remove the noise due to the complexity of welding environment. Comparison of three <b>noise</b> <b>filters</b> (Gaussian filter, Median filter and Wiener filter) was made to find out the optimal <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> algorithm. The result showed that the Median filter algorithm is the preferred method, as not only this algorithm performance provided lower MSE (Mean Square Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) values than those of Gaussian filter and Wiener filter, but also the values of the PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) were higher. Therefore, the Median filter can be considered to have a better enhancement effect than the other two filters...|$|R
