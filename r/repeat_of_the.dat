5|$|A modern <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1858 {{storm is}} {{estimated}} to cause damages of {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars. A <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1939 tropical storm would cause around 200million dollars in damage. The most serious damage would be due to rains rather than winds or storm surge, although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf, possibly injuring or killing people. Nora caused millions in damage and skirted extreme southeastern California.|$|E

5|$|After Alois's {{sudden death}} on 3 January 1903, Hitler's {{performance}} at school deteriorated {{and his mother}} allowed him to leave. He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved.

5|$|Rossia was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armored cruiser , but the Director of the Naval Ministry wanted the armor to cover more of the ship's side. However the design went through a number of changes during late 1892 and early 1893 and incorporated a number of technological advances that had recently become available. One notable change was the deletion of Ruriks sailing rig.|$|E

5|$|The cycle repeats at a {{frequency}} relative to {{how long it}} takes a wave to travel to the first open hole and back twice (i.e. four times the length of the pipe). For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e. the trill 'B' key is pressed), the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents a <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle 440 times per second.|$|E

5|$|Adolf Hitler {{was furious}} that the British {{had been able}} to sail a {{flotilla}} of ships up the Loire unhindered. His immediate reaction was to dismiss Generaloberst Carl Hilpert, chief-of-staff to the Commander in Chief West. The raid refocused German attention on the Atlantic Wall, and special attention was given to ports to prevent any <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raid. By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain.|$|E
5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E

5|$|British colonial {{secretary}} Lord Hillsborough, {{hoping to}} prevent a <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter. On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter {{by a vote of}} 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E
5|$|During the 19992000 college {{football}} season, Virginia Tech went undefeated {{during the regular}} season but lost to Florida State in the 2000 BCS National Championship Game. In the offseason following the championship-game loss, Tech fans and pundits anticipated a possible <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hokies' undefeated regular season and national championship run. In the annual preseason poll of media members covering Big East Conference football, Virginia Tech was picked to finish second; Tech received nine first-place votes to Miami's 15.

5|$|During {{the clay}} season, Federer's {{victory in the}} Hamburg Masters final was {{particularly}} impressive, as it snapped Rafael Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-Era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set bagel. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in a <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.|$|E

The PSAC report was almost a <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RBIG. They recommended that Zeus should not be built, at least without significant changes to allow it to better deal with the emerging problems.|$|E
5|$|In June 1964, {{during a}} {{performance}} at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke {{the head of his}} guitar on the low ceiling of the stage.

The following week, the audience were keen to see a <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became a feature of the Who's live set.|$|E
5|$|In November 1953, it was {{suggested}} that the existing two episodes could be combined and followed with a condensed live production of {{the latter part of the}} story for a special Christmas omnibus <b>repeat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serial. This idea was abandoned. Although Cartier and star Reginald Tate were keen to make an all-film omnibus version for television, this also did not come to fruition. In 1963, one of the existing episodes was selected as a representative of early British programming for the Festival of World Television at the National Film Theatre in London.|$|E
