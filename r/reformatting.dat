25|$|<b>Reformatting</b> an SD {{card with}} a {{different}} file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use wear leveling, in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32. In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; <b>reformatting</b> may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient.|$|E
25|$|Comprehensive {{studies of}} this {{phenomenon}} {{have shown that the}} position of the cavity is critical in creating sound. The process has hysteresis loops and the frequencies are related to multiples of the quarter wavelength resonance of the cavity. After <b>reformatting</b> Hartmann’s formula, and using the new formulation above, an equation for sound power can be written.|$|E
25|$|When <b>reformatting</b> an SD {{card with}} a {{capacity}} of at least 32MB (65536 logical sectors or more), {{but not more than}} 2GB, FAT16B with partition type 06h and EBPB 4.1 is recommended if the card is for a consumer device. (FAT16B is also an option for 4GB cards, but it requires the use of 64kiB clusters, which are not widely supported.) FAT16B does not support cards above 4GB at all.|$|E
50|$|Around July 1999, it was <b>reformatted</b> to The Hive 100.3, playing {{alternative}} rock, indie rock & classic rock music. Its format {{was similar}} to the defunct RJ Underground Radio 105.9. On September 1, 2001, The Hive finally <b>reformatted</b> to a variety hits format and rebranded it as 100.3 RJFM. In 2003, RJFM <b>reformatted</b> to The Greatest and Latest radio station.|$|R

50|$|On October 20, 2013, The Buzz format was {{discontinued}} and was <b>reformatted</b> into {{an interactive}} entertainment talk-show called Buzz ng Bayan (English: Buzz of the Nation). With the <b>reformat,</b> together with Boy Abunda, Carmina Villaroel and Janice de Belen were added as hosts. The show had three segments, namely: Top News Items, Opinions, and Panel Discussion. After the segment Top News Items, several personalities known as Bayan Buzzers (usually three), would give their own opinions regarding that certain issue. Aida Espiritu, aide of ABS-CBN president, CEO and COO Charo Santos-Concio and Onse Tolentino, a comedian and entertainment reporter/columnist, {{were the most}} notable and considered the resident Bayan Buzzers.More than 6 months after the <b>reformatted</b> The Buzz came into airing, Villaroel confirmed that the show will again be <b>reformatted</b> and return to its old title as The Buzz. She also confirmed that {{she will not be}} part of the <b>reformat,</b> and stated that two former hosts in The Buzz will return to the show together with Boy Abunda.|$|R
25|$|The Schools' Cup was reformatted in 2003/04. Previously teams {{defeated}} {{in the first round}} would enter the Subsidiary Shield competition, teams losing in later rounds would find their season over. All entrants, except those who drew byes, entered {{in the first round of}} the competition. It was felt that this could lead to significant mismatches. The <b>reformatting</b> sought to avoid this and to extend the amount of meaningful rugby played by school teams.|$|E
25|$|CBC {{cancelled}} Search Engine in June 2008 as {{a separate}} program on its radio schedule, leading to the show's <b>reformatting</b> into a podcast distributed by the CBC while Brown additionally started contributing tech-related material as a feature supplement to other CBC Radio shows such as Metro Morning, The Point, and The Sunday Edition. By spring 2009, {{in the wake of}} the corporation's budget cuts, CBC Radio fully terminated its association with Search Engine.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>reformatting</b> of the NCAA Baseball Tournament in 1999, Tech and UGA have hosted eight super regionals – the fourthmost super regionals {{hosted by}} a state behind California, Texas, and Florida. The two teams have met six times in the NCAA tournament with Georgia holding a 4–2 edge over Tech. Georgia has {{eliminated}} Tech three times in tournament play in 1987, 2001, and 2008. Tech avenged the 2001 elimination by eliminating UGA in 2002. Tech and UGA's latest meeting in the 2008 NCAA tournament saw UGA sweep Tech in a two game series, which eliminated Tech from the tournament.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{reproducibility}} of a standardized image for personal identification (SIPI), used in the comparative analysis of paranasal sinuses, and test the effect of inaccurate reformation of the SIPI on suitability for comparative identification. Five raters with different professional backgrounds independently <b>reformatted</b> SIPIs from ten post-mortem head CTs. Inter-rater, intra-rater agreement as well angular deviations between <b>reformatted</b> SIPI images and reference SIPI images were calculated. Second, raters assessed the suitability of 70 accurately and inaccurately <b>reformatted</b> SIPIs for identification with a 4 -point Likert scale. Inter-rater agreement as well as levels of significance regarding image suitability were calculated. Inter-rater agreement regarding reproducibility of SIPI reformation was excellent (inter-rater correlation coefficient (ICC) 0. 9995, intra-rater ICC 0. 9983). Deviation between the angular dimensions of the <b>reformatted</b> SIPIs and the reference SIPIs was ≤ 1 ° in 94 % of all 300 measurements. Inter-rater agreement regarding the effect of inaccurate SIPI reformation on suitability for comparative identification was fair (ICC 0. 6809). There was no statistically significant difference between raters' evaluation of image suitability (p= 0. 9755). This study shows that the standardized image for personal identification can be accurately <b>reformatted</b> by different raters with varying professional backgrounds. In addition, raters agree that inaccurately <b>reformatted</b> SIPIs are still suitable for comparative identification in the majority of cases...|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} months of the Republic Comín emerged as engaged in a number of Jaimist {{initiatives}} going far beyond the regional realm and with major nationwide impact. In June 1931 he contributed to <b>reformatting</b> of Requeté from a self-defense militia to a paramilitary formation; more importantly, in the autumn of that year and with a group of senior Carlist leaders he took part in preliminary talks with the Alfonsist politicians, intended as preparations for a would-be dynastical agreement. Fully authorized by Don Jaime, they met with the Alfonsinos in San Sebastián, leading later to the so-called Pacto de Territet. Comín's stance on dynastical agreement is not clear; later that year he was noted as speaking against any common monarchist movement, including sort of a monarchist shirt organization.|$|E
25|$|Computer games {{sometimes}} use DRM {{technologies to}} limit the number of systems the game can be installed on by requiring authentication with an online server. Most games with this restriction allow three or five installs, although some allow an installation to be 'recovered' when the game is uninstalled. This not only limits users who have more than three or five computers in their homes (seeing as the rights of the software developers allow them {{to limit the}} number of installations), but can also prove to be a problem if the user has to unexpectedly perform certain tasks like upgrading operating systems or <b>reformatting</b> the computer's hard drive, tasks which, depending on how the DRM is implemented, count a game's subsequent reinstall as a new installation, making the game potentially unusable after a certain period even if it is only used on a single computer.|$|E
500|$|In 1986, {{the then}} Controller of BBC One, Michael Grade, {{unhappy with the}} current state of Doctor Who, wrote to Newman to enquire whether he had any ideas for <b>reformatting</b> the series, which was at the time {{struggling}} in the ratings. Newman wrote back to Grade on October 6 that year with a set of detailed proposals and a suggestion that he take direct control of the series as executive producer. Grade suggested that Newman meet the current Head of Drama, Jonathan Powell, for lunch to discuss the Canadian's ideas. Newman and Powell did not get on well, however, and nothing came of their meeting. He was also unsuccessful in an attempt to have his name added to the end credits of the show as its creator. Acting Head of Series & Serials Ken Riddington, to whom Newman's request had been referred, wrote to him that [...] "Heads of Department who originate programmes have to be satisfied with the other rewards that flow from doing so." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{working as}} a {{creative}} director and a writer for Adventure Time– another Cartoon Network production– {{on top of a}} new house and the birth of his child, the network again gave McHale an opportunity to pitch an idea. Having worked in animation for other people {{as well as on the}} short animated works of his own, but with nothing for him to call a [...] "professional" [...] piece, McHale did not anticipate the network to have it go further than the short. During production, <b>reformatting</b> the film to a miniseries and not as a traditional television adaptation was proposed by McHale and the network, tongue-in-cheek. Following its release, they both found the format more than suitable. Retitled as Over the Garden Wall, the miniseries was announced in May 2014. Nick Cross, who worked as a background painter with layout designer Chris Tsirgiotis on Tome of the Unknown, was hired as the art director for the series.|$|E
500|$|As such, three {{candidates}} {{appeared on the}} general election ballot: Peduto, Wander and Ludwig. From the outset, Peduto was heavily favored by local media and political observers {{to win the election}} owing to the Democratic Party's voter registration advantage in Pittsburgh, although Wander stated that it was not his sole intention to win the race, but rather to [...] "convey a message that there is a choice." [...] Two debates had been scheduled in October 2013, but Wander—who had been running his campaign from Israel, where he was working as a security consultant—and Ludwig did not attend. As a result, Peduto was the only candidate to attend the events, <b>reformatting</b> them as town hall events, and local television station WTAE-TV cancelled an October 29 debate as Wander did not confirm that {{he would be able to}} attend. Ultimately, Bill Peduto defeated both Wander and Ludwig to be elected as the 60th Mayor of Pittsburgh and was inaugurated to succeed Luke Ravenstahl in January 2014.|$|E
500|$|After {{the story}} arc {{finished}} serialisation, the publishing company Casterman divided it into two volumes, [...] and , which they released in 1948 and 1949 respectively. To {{fit into the}} 62-page format, a number of scenes were deleted from the story's publication in book form. These included {{a scene in which}} Tintin chases away a cat aboard the Pachacamac, Haddock drawing a picture of Tintin on a wall, Haddock chewing coca provided by Zorrino, Tintin shooting a jaguar, and Haddock discovering gold nuggets under the Temple of the Sun but being unable to take them back with him. British Tintin expert Michael Farr noted that none of these scenes were [...] "integral to the narrative", and that their removal improved its structure. The <b>reformatting</b> also led to an error in the depiction of the solar eclipse. In the original magazine serialisation, Hergé had depicted the moon moving across the sun in the correct direction for the Southern Hemisphere; for the book publication, the drawings had been altered, with the moon now moving in the incorrect direction.|$|E

500|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, when Hergé's {{popularity}} had increased, he and {{his team}} at Studios Hergé redrew and coloured many of the original black-and-white Tintin adventures using the [...] ("clear line") drawing style he had developed so that they visually fitted in with the new Tintin stories being created. The Broken Ear was the first of these early Adventures to undergo the <b>reformatting</b> and colouration, and this second edition was published as a 62-page volume by Casterman in 1943. Unlike some of the earlier adventures, The Broken Ear was not redrawn, save for a few minor revisions. To reduce the length of the book, various sections were excised, including a dream sequence that appeared in the original. As the colouration process was new to the series, the use of colour in The Broken Ear is more basic than in later volumes; as the book progresses, it is evident that Hergé lost interest and rushed the task, for instance, resorting to using block colour backgrounds without any detail.|$|E
