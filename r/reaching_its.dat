5|$|A {{tropical}} depression was first observed 300mi (485km) southeast of Socorro Island on September29.

After <b>reaching</b> <b>its</b> peak intensity, Hurricane Six rapidly weakened, and passed 70mi (125km) southeast of Socorro Island with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Further weakening occurred, and the storm had dissipated on September 30.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, the 1950 Census showed {{growth in}} Teaneck (33.6%) pacing Bergen County overall (31.6%). Starting in 1960, a {{substantial}} {{decline in the}} rate of growth compared to Bergen County occurred as Teaneck reached the limits of developable land, and the township neared its peak population. Population growth in the 1970 Census was small, but positive, with Teaneck <b>reaching</b> <b>its</b> historical maximum of 42,355. Absolute declines in population followed in both the 1980 (−7.9%) and 1990 (−3.0%) data.

5|$|An {{affluent}} 19th-century {{agricultural community}} {{of the same name}} established near the lakeside in the mid-19th century, but dwindled in status, becoming virtually abandoned {{in the aftermath of the}} American Civil War.

After <b>reaching</b> <b>its</b> low point during the Great Depression, the lakeside community modestly rebounded in 1947 following the nearby discovery of oil.
