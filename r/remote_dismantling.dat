40|$|Siempelkamp Nukleartechnik GmbH {{is engaged}} in the {{optimization}} of decommissioning processes for several years. With respect {{of the complexity of}} the projects, the time frame and the budget it is necessary to find more effective ways to handle those tasks in the near future. The decommissioning and dismantling will be achieved in six steps taking into account that some processing equipment can be dismantled before and the rest only after the High Active Liquid Waste Concentrate (HAWC) has been vitrified approximately by mid of 2005. After the successful beginning of the <b>remote</b> <b>dismantling</b> of the main process cells from March 2000, the next <b>remote</b> <b>dismantling</b> project at the WAK was initiated April 2000...|$|E
40|$|The <b>remote</b> <b>dismantling</b> apparatus, {{which is}} {{equipped}} with multi-units for functioning of washing, cutting, collection of cut pieces and so on, has been constructed to dismantle the large-sized vessels in the JAERI's Reprocessing Test Facility (JRTF). The apparatus has five-axis movement capability and its operation is performed remotely. The mock-up tests were performed to evaluate {{the applicability of the}} apparatus to actual dismantling activities by using the mock-ups of LV- 3 and LV- 5 in the facility. It was confirmed that each unit was satisfactory functioned by remote operation. Efficient procedure for dismantling the large-sized vessel was studied and various data were obtained from the mock-up tests. This apparatus was found to be applicable for the actual dismantling activity in JRTF...|$|E
