40|$|After the {{bankruptcy}} abuse <b>reform</b> (<b>BAR)</b> took effect in October 2005, foreclosures on subprime mortgages surged nationwide. • Prior to BAR, overly indebted borrowers could file bankruptcy {{to free up}} income to pay their mortgage by discharging unsecured debts; BAR eliminated that option for better-off filers through a means test and other requirements, {{making it more difficult}} to save one’s home by filing bankruptcy. • A study of the <b>reform</b> suggests that <b>BAR</b> was associated with more subprime foreclosures; BAR’s effects were greater in states with high bankruptcy exemptions, as theory predicts. • For a state with an average home equity exemption, the subprime foreclosure rate after BAR rose 11 percent relative to average before the reform; given the number of subprime mortgages nationwide, that translates into 29, 000 additional subprime foreclosures per quarter nationwide.

40|$|The city of Portland adopted {{different}} {{policies toward}} gay bars between 1948 and 1965. Portland 2 ̆ 7 s conservative mayors, generally uninterested {{in changing the}} city or promoting growth, ignored gay <b>bars.</b> <b>Reform</b> mayors instigated campaigns against gay bars to gain public, political, and business support for their broader economic and social goals. They {{were able to use}} crackdowns on gay bars as popular components of their reform initiatives because Portland, in comparison to other cities, professed conservatism and morality and had little economic or cultural incentive to tolerate gay bars. Blaming Portland 2 ̆ 7 s vice on outsiders, reform mayors argued that their actions protected Portland 2 ̆ 7 s traditional reputability, despite the city 2 ̆ 7 s long history of tolerating vice and gay bars. This thesis focuses on the reform mayoral administrations of Dorothy McCullough Lee and Terry Schrunk and their policies toward gay bars and vice. Chapter two discusses Lee 2 ̆ 7 s attack on all criminality in Portland, and deals briefly with why the previous administration, under Frank Riley, was rejected as corrupt. Terry Schrunk 2 ̆ 7 s later reform, centered in suppressing sexual deviance and promoting economic development downtown, is discussed in chapter four. Chapter three describes growing awareness of queer communities, including changing definitions of queerness and perceived threats. These changes in popular beliefs about queerness, although not the direct cause of actions against gay bars in Portland, influenced the types of vice associated with gay bars, arguments used to justify anti-queer actions, and the level of priority placed on suppressing Portland 2 ̆ 7 s queer community. This thesis incorporates primary and secondary sources on gay bars, Portland, and queer history. It relies heavily on city council minutes and newspaper articles, but also draws from sources including City Club Bulletins, letters from Schrunk 2 ̆ 7 s constituents, interviews, popular psychological works, and comparisons with articles about other cities, such as Miami, San Francisco, and New York...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines historically feminized professions in the American film industry, such as casting, script {{supervision and}} secretaryial positions -work that remains female-dominated or feminized across gender today. To {{account for the}} continued existence of these gendered sectors of labor and illuminate the place of feminized labor in the industrial logic of media production, the dissertation locates the origins of industrial notions of "women's work" in the sex segregation practices which developed at the early studios of the 1910 s and 20 s. The dissertation then follows this logic of feminization, as well as the work sectors that grew up around it, through the 1930 s and 40 s, by which time "women's work" and feminized labor had become essential to the functioning of major U. S. studios' large-scale operations. The study reveals how earlier practices of sex segregation and feminization continue to impact the industry today, half a century {{after the end of the}} studio system, when legal-political <b>reforms</b> have supposedly <b>barred</b> gender-based discrimination in American workplaces. The project's thesis posits that the professions were feminized due to their work's roots in clerical or other traditionally feminized sectors, and developed additional gendered practices as women fit themselves to the work assigned to of them through culturally acceptable gender performance in order to succeed, acquire additional responsibility, and in some cases expand their creative agency. As such, women's professions and workplace identities within media production culture were, in effect, co-constructed by the female media worker and the system, a negotiation between the worker's agency and that of the forces that acted upon her. The research integrates a primarily archival methodology with conceptual tools from gender and media production studies. The project is grounded in an examination of the cultural and industrial causes of the feminization of certain types of film labor. It accounts for feminization and its effects through of both public and studio discourse around women's labor, and the statements of the workers themselves. This top-down/bottom-up triangulation attempts to address historiographic concerns presented by subject matter that has largely been marginalized into the footnotes of other Hollywood histories of "great men" and great texts...|$|R
