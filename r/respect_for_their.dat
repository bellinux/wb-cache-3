5|$|The three episodes {{were tied}} {{together}} by {{the story of a}} murdered Haitian domestic worker employed by wealthy philanthropist Felix Wilson, played by Jones. Protagonists Frank Pembleton and Al Giardello initially refuse to properly investigate the Wilson family out of <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> success and contributions to the African American community of Baltimore, which leads to tensions and accusations of discrimination within the police department. The storyline serves as a rumination and commentary on racism and classism, even when they come from the best of intentions.|$|E
5|$|When an eye injury forced Steve Yzerman (who {{normally}} wore number 19 for Canada) to {{miss the}} 2004 World Cup of Hockey, Sakic and Joe Thornton both refused the number out of <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> injured countryman, even though both players each wore the number 19 for their respective NHL clubs and who were now eligible to wear it for Team Canada in Yzerman's absence.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in Springfield, Adil {{arrives and}} {{turns out to}} be very friendly, helping out Marge with the family chores. Homer {{immediately}} takes a shine to him, and it is noticeable that he is a better son and role model than Bart ever was. However, Marge challenges Homer that while she appreciates Adil's good behavior, part of being good parents is that they have the same <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> natural children, in that is Homer being concerned for Bart while he is abroad. Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor. Homer unwittingly takes him {{on a tour of the}} power plant and thinks nothing of the many photographs Adil takes, which Adil sends home by a secret fax machine in Bart's tree house.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{went back}} to China in November 1934, again serving briefly with the 4th Marines in Shanghai. He was soon reassigned as a {{legation}} guard in Peiping, where he taught the post's pistol and rifle teams to shoot competitively. They won {{at least one major}} competition. He also had time to observe the troops of the Empire of Japan, gaining great <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> discipline. In 1936, he came down with a serious case of pneumonia and had to be evacuated from China. His next duty was at Puget Sound Navy Yard. In October 1936, he was promoted to captain. In July 1937 he entered Junior Course, Marine Corps Schools in Quantico, which he completed in May 1938. He then served as an instructor at Quantico for two years.

25|$|The late 1970s {{and early}} 1980s were a {{turbulent}} {{time for the}} Taiwan-born {{as many of the}} people who had originally been oppressed and left behind by economic changes became members of the Taiwan's new middle class. Free enterprise had allowed native Taiwanese to gain a powerful bargaining chip in their demands for <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> basic human rights. The Kaohsiung Incident would be a major turning point for democracy in Taiwan.|$|E

In addition to hosting an annual International Jazz Competition since 1987, the Institute also helped, through its partnership with UNESCO, designate April 30, 2012, as the first annual International Jazz Day.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "sophistry" [...] {{developed}} strong negative connotations {{in ancient}} Greece that continue today, but in ancient Greece sophists were nevertheless popular and well-paid professionals, widely <b>respected</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> abilities but also widely criticized <b>for</b> <b>their</b> excesses.|$|R

25|$|The {{settlement}} of the Fengu in the annexed territory had far-reaching consequences. This wandering nation claimed to be escaping oppression {{at the hands of}} the Gcaleka and, in return for the land they were given by the Cape, they became the Cape Colony's formidable allies. They swiftly acquired firearms and formed mounted commandos for the defense of their new land. In the following wars they fought alongside the Cape Colony as invaluable allies, not as subordinates, and won considerable renown and <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> martial ability.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale in Cairo {{announced}} he had uncovered new evidence the Great Sphinx {{may have been}} the work of the little-known Pharaoh Djedefre (2528–2520BC), Khafra's half brother and a son of Khufu. Dobrev suggests Djedefre built the Sphinx in the image of his father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god Ra in order to restore <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> dynasty. Dobrev also notes, like Stadelmann and others, the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid to the temples was built around the Sphinx suggesting it was already in existence at the time.|$|E
25|$|For all its success, the Balloon Corps {{was never}} fully {{appreciated}} {{by the military}} community. They were still regarded as carnival showmen. Others had little <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> break-neck operation. The only ones who found any value in them were the generals whose jobs and reputations were on the line. Lower-ranking administrators looked with disdain on this band of civilians who, as they perceived them, had {{no place in the}} military. Furthermore, none of the corps ever received a military commission, leaving them facing the dangers of being captured and treated as spies, summarily punishable by death.|$|E

25|$|The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) {{has had the}} {{opportunity}} to rule in recent years on several cases involving the legitimacy of firing a person from their job due to adultery. These cases dealt with people working for religious organizations and raised the question of the balancing of the right of a person to <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> private life (recognized in the EU) and the right of religious communities to be protected against undue interference by the State (recognized also in the EU). These situations must be analyzed with regard to their specific circumstances, in each case. The ECtHR had ruled both in favor of the religious organization (in the case of Obst) and in favor of the fired person (in the case of Schüth).|$|E
25|$|On May 1, 2004, Yzerman {{was hit in}} the eye by a {{deflected}} slapshot by the Calgary Flames defenceman Rhett Warrener in {{a playoff}} game, breaking his orbital bone and scratching his cornea. Yzerman underwent eye surgery following the incident, and was sidelined {{for the rest of the}} 2004 post-season. The eye injury also forced Yzerman to miss the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. Fellow Canadians Joe Thornton (then of the Boston Bruins) and Joe Sakic (Colorado), who each wore the number 19 for their respective NHL clubs and who were now eligible to wear it for team Canada due to Yzerman's enforced absence, both refused the number out of <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> injured countryman. Yzerman returned in the 2005–06 season, following the labour lock-out in 2004–05, wearing a face shield.|$|E
25|$|A cowboy is {{an animal}} herder who tends cattle on ranches in North America, {{traditionally}} on horseback, and often performs {{a multitude of}} other ranch-related tasks. The historic American cowboy of the late 19th century arose from the vaquero traditions of northern Mexico and became a figure of special significance and legend. A subtype, called a wrangler, specifically tends the horses used to work cattle. In addition to ranch work, some cowboys work for or participate in rodeos. Cowgirls, first defined as such in the late 19th century, had a less-well documented historical role, but {{in the modern world}} have established the ability to work at virtually identical tasks and obtained considerable <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> achievements. There are also cattle handlers in many other parts of the world, particularly South America and Australia, who perform work similar to the cowboy in their respective nations.|$|E

25|$|Ion Luca Caragiale was {{interested}} in the politics of the Romanian Kingdom, and oscillated between the liberal current and conservatism. Most of his satirical works target the liberal republicans and the National Liberals, evidencing both his <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> rivals at Junimea and his connections with the literary critic Titu Maiorescu. He came to clash with National Liberal leaders such as Dimitrie Sturdza and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, and was a lifelong adversary of the Symbolist poet Alexandru Macedonski. As a result of these conflicts, the most prominent of Caragiale's critics barred his access to the cultural establishment for several decades. During the 1890s, Caragiale rallied with the radical movement of George Panu, before associating with the Conservative Party. After having decided to settle in Berlin, he came to voice strong criticism for Romanian politicians of all colors {{in the wake of the}} 1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt, and ultimately joined the Conservative-Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|By 1887, {{peace was}} {{established}} between the Al Fadl and their Circassian and Druze rivals {{as a result}} of Ottoman recognition of the tribe's pasture rights and territorial boundaries. As a result, the territory of the Fa'our branch of the Al Fadl included large parts of the Golan Heights, part of the Hauran plain, and the eastern Hula Valley. These lands were registered {{in the name of the}} emir, who thereafter collected rent from its tenants. Most of the tenants were Fadl tribesmen who had shifted from a nomadism to a semi-sedentism that combined agriculture and grazing. The emir, who resided in Damascus, was in effect an absentee landlord, and he and his immediate family became wealthy members of the Damascene social elite. The emir married a woman from the well-known Kurdish Damascene family, Buzu. Some Kurdish families, including the Buzu, were afterward incorporated into Al Fadl. Despite the absence of blood relations, the newer households held great pride and <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> association with the tribe's leading household, the Fa'our.|$|E
25|$|Saudi Arabian dress {{strictly}} {{follows the}} principles of hijab (the Islamic principle of modesty, especially in dress). The predominantly loose and flowing, but covering, garments are suited to Saudi Arabia's desert climate. Traditionally, men usually wear a white ankle length garment woven from wool or cotton (known as a thawb), with a keffiyeh (a large checkered square of cotton {{held in place by}} an agal) or a ghutra (a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by an agal) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a camel-hair cloak (bisht) over the top. In public women are required to wear a black abaya or other black clothing that covers everything under the neck with the exception of their hands and feet, although most women cover their head in <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> religion. This requirement applies to non-Muslim women too and failure to abide can result in police action, particularly in more conservative areas of the country. Women's clothes are often decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques.|$|E
