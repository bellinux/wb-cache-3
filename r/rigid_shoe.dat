40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{accurately}} calculate the braking efficiency factor of drum brake shoe of heavy truck, virtual prototyping {{of a heavy}} truck's brake is demonstrated. The requirements for brakes include not only its performance but also its comfort, serviceability and working lifetime, which must be high. The finite element analysis software ANSYS and the multi-body system simulation software MSC. ADAMS were used to establish the drum brake nonlinear 3 D simulation model. The model was built by developing joint program module between the <b>rigid</b> <b>shoe</b> and the flexible lining and nonlinear contact force program module between the lining and the rigid drum. Using this model, the simulation was executed for the drum brake of 32 t heavy duty truck. The {{results show that the}} simulated braking efficiency factor coincides with experimental results of the braking efficiency factor of the heavy truck drum brake...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, the {{footwear}} worn {{to school}} by children in Australia was dictated by school uniform codes and footwear policies that were strictly enforced in many schools. As such, school children typically wore a low-heeled, <b>rigid,</b> lace-up <b>shoe</b> with a leather upper, most commonly black or brown, similar to an Oxford shoe (Rossi, 2000).

40|$|Foot-stretcher force {{contributes}} to rowing performance. A New Zealand designed modified rowing foot-stretcher has a <b>rigid</b> clog <b>shoe</b> with heel and toe wedges to allow contact {{of the whole}} surface of the foot to the foot-plate throughout the entire rowing stroke. This study examined the effect of modified and standard foot-stretchers for eight competitive rowers during on-water double scull and static Concept 2 ergometer 500 -m rowing. Race time and comfort were recorded. Comfort measures indicated that the modified foot-stretcher was preferred both on-water and ergometer. Performance time measures indicated a potential performance enhancement with the modified foot-stretcher on-water (2. 0 %), however due to large confidence intervals, the results were unclear. This modified foot-stretcher assisted athletes rowing comfort and showed potential for performance enhancement...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of foot orthoses on the pattern of center of pressure in women with forefoot deformities during walking. Nine subjects with a forefoot varus and nine subjects with a forefoot valgus walked across a force platform three times for each of the following five treatment conditions: 1) barefoot, 2) <b>shoes</b> only, 3) <b>rigid</b> orthoses with <b>shoes,</b> 4) semi-rigid orthoses with shoes, and 5) soft orthoses with shoes. Force data were analyzed to determine the area under the center-of-pressure curve. A significant omnibus F ratio was obtained for treatments (p <. 001) and the deformity X treatments interaction (p <. 05) using a two-factor, mixed analysis of variance for repeated measures. Tukey's post hoc comparisons for the Varus Group resulted in significant differences (p <. 05) between the following treatment conditions: 1) barefoot and shoes only, 2) barefoot and <b>rigid</b> orthoses with <b>shoes,</b> 3) barefoot and semi-rigid orthoses with shoes, and 4) barefoot and soft orthoses with shoes. Tukey's post hoc comparisons for the Valgus Group resulted in significant differences (p <. 05) between the following treatment conditions: 1) barefoot and <b>rigid</b> orthoses with <b>shoes,</b> 2) barefoot and semi-rigid orthoses with shoes, and 3) barefoot and soft orthoses with shoes. The shoes-only treatment condition, in comparison with the barefoot condition, significantly reduced the center-of-pressure area for the Varus Group only. All three types of foot orthoses with shoes, when compared with the barefoot condition, significantly reduced the pattern of the center of pressure for the Valgus Group. No differences among materials used for orthosis fabrication were evident. [McPoil TG Jr, Adrian M, Pidcoe P: Effects of foot orthoses on center-of-gravity patterns in women. Phy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{anthropomorphic}} biped robot Bip {{is equipped}} with sensors for measuring the ground/feet forces in order to localize the center of pressure (CoP) and zero moment point (ZMP). This paper focuses on experimental results regarding {{the evolution of the}} ground contact forces, obtained from a human walker wearing the robot feet as shoes. First, one determines the influence of heavy and <b>rigid</b> metallic <b>shoes</b> on the gait of the subject, during experiments carried out on flat ground. Second, the evolution of the contact forces is studied while walking on parallel planes with different elevations (stairs), then one addresses the case where the feet are supported by two nonparallel planes (uneven terrain). The corresponding analysis is founded on the concepts of virtual supporting surface and pseudo-CoP-ZMP introduced in a companion paper, discussing the theoretical aspects of CoP and ZMP (Sardain and Bessonnet, 2004). Beyond the academic contribution, the data analyzed in this paper could constitute an incitement to design truly anthropomorphic feet, for Bip as well as for other biped robots, because all the current robot feet are functionally rather poor.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} often {{gives rise}} to painful collapse or partial collapse of the foot into valgus under load-bearing conditions, limiting the subject's ability to walk. However, the ankle joint frequently remains unimpaired. Thus, in serious cases a cosmetic splint is required which supports the foot whilst allowing the ankle to plantarflex and dorsiflex. The Cherwell ankle-foot orthosis has been designed and extensively tested in Oxford and elsewhere during the last four years, and can now be prescribed and supplied from three orthopaedic centres to meet this requirement. KEY WORDS: Rheumatoid arthritis, Orthotics, Ankle, Foot. DAMAGE to the metatarsophalangeal joints is very common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and its treatment, whether by conservative or operative methods, well established (1). Although symptoms and radiological evidence of disease are less frequent in the more proximal foot and in the ankle joints, the almost universal tendency for damaged mid-tarsal and sub-talar rheumatoid joints to collapse into valgus under load, means that stand-ing and walking are painful in approximately half the patients (2). The size of {{the problem has been}} estimated (3) and it is possible that up to 1 % of the population could require some form of mid- or hind-foot support. In {{the early stages of the}} condition, the arches of the foot can be maintained, and pressure points can be relieved by insoles and other adaptations to the <b>shoes.</b> <b>Rigid</b> insoles and <b>shoe</b> modifications can also change the line of force through the foot and thereby reduce pain and instability. As the disease develops, some feet remain fully or partially mobile, but walking becomes extremely painful. Insoles and corrected shoes are inadequate, and the patient's daily activities become restricted. The disease may, however, take another course, with the foot becoming deformed and rigid, so that special footwear is necessary. To meet the need for conservative treatment of painful valgus feet, the Cherwell cosmetic orthosis was designed and developed in 1978. Since that time it has undergone extensive field trials in Oxford and elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|In filming and {{digitizing}} human segmental motion, external markers do {{not necessarily}} represent a true picture of the actual bone movement. When surface markers are placed on the skin or skate boot (in ice hockey) they move according to skin or boot movement, which does not exactly match bone movement. This results in a misrepresentation of the joint axes of rotation and a greater margin of error in motion measurement and analysis. This problem occurs for ankle and foot movements as their motion is quantified about the ankle joint complex (talocrural and subtalar joints). Hockey skates are vastly more <b>rigid</b> than regular <b>shoes</b> and their restriction of foot movement is greater. Therefore, shoes and hockey skates cannot be considered identical. The present study aims at exploring differences amongst bone, skin, and skate marker based motions of the foot during skating. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{majority}} of polyurethanes are crosslinked thermoset polymers, which cannot be recycled by melting and extrusion processes without excessive degradation. Sev-eral recycling techniques for polyurethanes {{have been described}} in technical and scientific literature and are used industrially, such as rebonding of flexible foam, regrind and hot stamping of Reinforced Reaction Injection Molding (RRIM) and glycolysis of rigid foams. Several chemical recycling methods for polyurethanes have been developed and pa-tented, such as hydrolysis, glycolysis, aminolysis and acidolysis. The glycolysis process is also being used on an industrial scale for recycling of "in house " production waste of <b>rigid</b> and microcellular <b>shoe</b> sole, polyurethane foam. This article describes a novel, new, chemical recycling process that has been developed to produce relatively high performance polyols from the recycling of a diversity of polyurethanes. This process is attractive for use on an industrial scale {{and appears to be}} commercially viable, based on cost-performance, particularly {{in the context of the}} total eco-balance of polyurethanes. Consequently, further development work and innovation, based upon this research, should be a high priority for the global polyurethanes industry to recycle "in house " and "post consumer " polyurethane waste. Molded MDI-based automotive seating foam has been converted into polyols, which can be used in prime automotive applications, such as low-density mat molding and sound in-sulation. TDI-based flexible slabstock foam and RRIM materials have been efficiently converted in to relatively high performance polyols by this new chemical recycling pro-cess...|$|R
