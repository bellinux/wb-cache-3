40|$|A {{key problem}} in all name {{resolution}} protocols {{today is that}} no one protocol performs well across all network architectures. In addition, DNS, the most widespread solution today, depends on a static and connected network layer and faces significant challenges in dynamic wireless networks. We introduce FERN (Federated Extensible Resolution of Names), the first framework designed to enable efficient name resolution across heterogeneous systems operating in dynamic or static networks. FERN organizes nodes into name <b>resolution</b> <b>groups</b> and allows each group to perform name resolution independently and in a manner best suited for that group. FERN arranges these name <b>resolution</b> <b>groups</b> into a hierarchy and allows these groups to communicate efficiently, discover each other’s presence, and resolve each other’s names. We demonstrate the flexibility and interoperability of FERN by deploying and evaluating it across heterogeneous environments, including a MANET, an infrastructure-based wireless network, and the Internet. We show that FERN performs at least as well as DNS, and yet extends name resolution to networks in which DNS is inadequate...|$|R

In particular, the H-depth 1 condition coincides with A being an H-separable extension of B. In this paper the H-depth of semisimple subalgebra pairs {{is derived from the}} transpose inclusion matrix, and for QF extensions it is derived from the odd depth of the endomorphism ring extension. For general extensions characterizations of H-depth are possible using the H-equivalence generalization of Morita theory. In certain nice categories of bimodules the minimum depth and H-depth of certain types of ring extensions are always finite.

The proposed scheme incorporates users ’ intention {{as well as}} user preferences into conflict resolution. Conflicts are resolved differently according to the situations of involved users even in the same conflicting situation. For multi-user environments, the proposed scheme dynamically resolves the conflicts occurring between different types of context-aware applications. It allows context-conflict management to become more transparent to application programmers.

40|$|A new {{technique}} of high <b>resolution</b> <b>group</b> velocity {{analysis for the}} study of dispersive seismic surface waves,is proposed. This method comprises the development of the Instantaneous Frequency Analysis which has a basis in the Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis. The feasibility of this method is tested using synthetic seismograms. Particular attention is paid from the practical point of view to the optimum length of the linear prediction filter and the resolution to the interference of the fundamental mode and the higher mode. We compare this method with a conventional bandpass filtration technique using the same synthetic seismograms. Our results show that this method has the advantage of retrieving the higher mode group velocity even for shallow earthquakes. 表面波の分散を研究するための,高精度の群速度推定法を考察した. この方法は最大エントロピー法を基礎とする,瞬間周波数解析に基づいている. この方法の有効性を理論記象を用いて調べ,特に実用的観点から,予測フィルターの最適な長さ及び基本モードと高次モードの干渉に対する分解能に注意をはらった. さらにバソドパスフィルターによる方法と比較した. この新しい方法は震源の浅い地震で励起された高次モードの群速度をも推定できる点で従来の方法に優っている...|$|E

The worst case cost of removing the top element is O(1). When the number of elements in the table is high, the amortized cost to insert an element becomes O(1) ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of dynamic-range compression in digital hearing aids. Digital technology is becoming increasingly common in hearing aids, particularly because of the processing flexibility it offers and the opportunity to create more-effective devices. The focus of the paper is on the algorithms used to build digital compression systems. Of the various approaches {{that can be used to}} design a digital hearing aid, this paper considers broadband compression, multi-channel filter banks, a frequency-domain compressor using the FFT, the side-branch design that separates the filtering operation from the frequency analysis, and the frequency-warped version of the side-branch approach that modifies the analysis frequency spacing to more closely match auditory perception. Examples of the compressor frequency <b>resolution,</b> <b>group</b> delay, and compression behavior are provided for the different design approaches...|$|E
40|$|We have {{obtained}} high <b>resolution</b> <b>group</b> velocity maps of Rayleigh waves at periods from 8 to 25 seconds across the Iberian Peninsula by cross-correlating {{four months of}} ambient noise data recorded by 40 permanent broadband stations. Group velocity maps accurately image the main structural elements of the Iberian upper crust, including the Iberian Massif, Alpine orogens and major sedimentary basins. The Pyrenees and the Iberian Chain are imaged as relatively high group velocities, {{in contrast with the}} Betic Cordillera, which is characterized by low velocities. We explain these low velocities in the Betics by the presence of widespread intramontane basins created in an extensional episode simultaneous with north-south convergence between the African and Eurasian plates. The most prominent low velocity anomalies in the Iberian Peninsula are related to the Guadalquivir Basin, the flysch units of the Campo de Gibraltar, and the sediments of the Gulf of Cadiz. 5 page(s...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the focus}} on higher {{education}} learning has shifted from knowledge to skills, with interpersonal skills likely being {{the most difficult to}} assess and work with. Wikis ease open collaboration among peers. A number of these skills can be objectively assessed by using wikis in an educational environment: collaborative writing, conflict <b>resolution,</b> <b>group</b> management, leadership, etc. However, when the number of students increases, their interactions usually increase at a higher rate. Under these circumstances, traditional assessment procedures suffer from scalability problems: manually evaluating in detail the information stored in a wiki to retrieve objective metrics becomes a complex and time-consuming task. Thus, automated tools are required to support the assessment of such processes. In this paper we compare seven case studies conducted in Computer Science courses of two Spanish universities: Cádiz and Seville. We comment on their different settings: durations, milestones, contribution sizes, weights in the final grade and, most importantly, their assessment methods. We discuss and compare the different methodologies and tools used to assess the desired skills in the context of each case study...|$|E
