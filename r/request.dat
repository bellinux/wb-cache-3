30|$|The {{choice of}} {{replication}} model impacts {{the ability of}} the data store to scale read and write <b>requests.</b> Master–slave replication is generally useful for scaling read <b>requests</b> because it allows the many slaves to accept read <b>requests</b> – examples are BerkeleyDB and MongoDB. However, some data stores such as HBase do not permit read <b>requests</b> on the slave nodes. In this case, replication is used solely for failover and disaster recovery. In addition, master–slave data stores do not scale write <b>requests</b> because the master is the only node that processes write <b>requests.</b> An interesting exception is the Neo 4 J database, which is able to handle write <b>requests</b> on the slave nodes also. In this case, write <b>requests</b> are synchronously propagated from slaves to master and therefore are slower than write <b>requests</b> to master. Finally, multi-master and masterless replication systems are usually capable of scaling read and write <b>requests</b> because all nodes can handle both <b>requests.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{extending the}} LARD system to handle web <b>requests</b> with dynamic content {{as well as}} static content.

Introduction With the evolution of faster networks and higher computing power, cluster-based network servers combine cutting-edge performance and low cost. Static <b>requests</b> are more used than dynamic <b>requests.</b> However, it is expected that dynamic <b>requests</b> will be more widespread to enable distributed web services, especially online and real-time services.
