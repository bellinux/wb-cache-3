40|$|Riveting is a {{commonly}} used (especially in aircraft structures) method of joining metal and composite components. The methods of forming solid shank rivets {{can be classified}} in two types: static and dynamic. The static method is the most efficient one. Regrettably, its application is limited. A popular upsetting tool used in an aircraft is a pneumatic riveter. The rivet driving requires a few hammer strokes. The total stress in a riveted joint depends on the residual and applied stress. Residual post-riveting stress fields are widely accepted to have a beneficial influence on the fatigue life of aircraft structures. The analysis is carried out for a solid mushroom rivet (made of PA 25 alloy) joining two sheets (made of 2024 T 3 alloy). Nonlinear dynamic simulations of the upsetting process are carried out. Simulation of the riveting process is significantly influenced by a material model.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the existing flush rivet inspection criteria and inspection methods to establish a norm for commercial flush riveted joints. Studies were made of thirty-four flush riveted joint load deformation curves to obtain their general characteristics and to establish some correlation of yield load as defined in ANC- 5 and as defined in Report on Flush Riveted Joint Strength by ARC Rivet and Screw Allowables Subcommittee (Airworthiness Project 12). The specimens corresponding to the load deformation curves were comprised of 18 machine countersunk joints, 12 double dimple joints and four sub-countersunk joints. Within each type of joints the specimen varied in series of sheet material and thickness, rivet material and rivet size. It is shown that yield load, defined as load giving four percent of <b>rivet</b> <b>diameter</b> joint set, is dependent on d/t ratios, the yield load lowering at increasing d/t values. Also, there are indications that as softer rivet material is used with a given sheet material, the increasing d/t ratios have less adverse effects. There could be made no particular correlation of yield load as defined by load at. 005 " set with any of the varying parameters. In the case of the double dimple and sub-countersunk joints, no particular conclusions could be reached as the test data was confined to a small range of d/t values. It was concluded from the countersunk rivet data that permanent set based on <b>rivet</b> <b>diameter</b> is a more reasonable yield criterion than permanent set based on an arbitrary constant. ...|$|E
40|$|Light weight {{structures}} {{typically have}} low inherent structural damping. The damping mechanism of jointed and riveted structures {{can be explained}} by considering the energy loss due to friction and the dynamic slip produced at the interfaces. The frictional damping is evaluated from the relative slip between the jointed interfaces and is considered to be the most useful method for investigating the structural damping. The damping characteristics in jointed structures are influenced by the intensity of pressure distribution, micro-slip and kinematic coefficient of friction at the interfaces and the effects of all these parameters on the mechanism of damping have been extensively studied. All the above vital parameters are largely influenced by the thickness ratio of the beam and thereby affect the damping capacity of the structures. In addition to this, number of layers, beam length and <b>diameter</b> of connecting <b>rivet</b> also play key roles on the damping capacity of the jointed structures quantitatively. The effects of all these parameters are studied vividly in the present investigation. It is established that the damping capacity can be enhanced appreciably using larger beam length and <b>rivet</b> <b>diameters</b> as well as lower thickness ratio of the beams. Further improvement in damping is possible with the use of more number of layers compared to its equivalent solid one. This design concept of using layered structures with riveted joints can be effectively utilized in trusses and frames, aircraft and aerospace structures, bridges, machine members, robots and many other applications where higher damping is required.

40|$|Comparable {{fatigue tests}} {{were carried out}} on {{aluminium}} alloy 7475 -T 7351 double butt joints with untreated and with cold expanded holes. Surprisingly, the behaviour of the specimens having cold expanded holes was worse than that of specimens with untreated holes. This result was attributed to the surface upset which was present in cold expanded holes. Several hypotheses were formulated and experimentally verified to overcome this problem, such as deeper hole deburring, <b>rivet</b> <b>diameter,</b> joint design and grip material, steel instead of aluminium alloy. Additional tests demonstrated that the problem was not present in sealed joint as the surface upset was hidden in the sealant thickness. Sealants have detrimental effects in the fatigue resistance of riveted joints, as they increase the load transferred by rivet bearing. The hole expansion is beneficial in this condition, while in un-sealed joints its effect must be accurately evaluated. Other authors too highlighted possible problems due to surface upset, up to suggest to eliminate it. Only in a very few cases, a reduction of fatigue life {{as a consequence of}} hole expansion was observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to analyze the crack-linkup behavior in riveted-stiffened lap-splice joint panels with small multiple-site damage (MSD) cracks at several adjacent rivet holes. Analyses are based on the STAGS (STructural Analysis of General Shells) code with the critical crack-tip-opening angle (CTOA) fracture criterion. To account for high constraint around a crack front, the "plane strain core" option in STAGS was used. The importance of modeling rivet flexibility with fastener elements that accurately model load transfer across the joint is discussed. Fastener holes are not modeled but rivet connectivity is accounted for by attaching rivets to the sheet {{on one side of the}} cracks that simulated both the <b>rivet</b> <b>diameter</b> and MSD cracks. Residual strength analyses made on 2024 -T 3 alloy (1. 6 -mm thick) riveted-lap-splice joints with a lead crack and various size MSD cracks were compared with test data from Boeing Airplane Company.

The leading edges of wing and empennage structures are required to meet the regulatory FAR 25. 571 and 25. 631 respectively for any bird strike damage. One of the design methodologies followed in the leading edge is to have skin, rib and baffle so that incase of penetration of the skin, the baffle will prevent the bird from impacting on the spar. During bird impact on such leading edges, the fasteners in baffle plate are subjected to pull through tensile forces due to buckling of the skin. Hence, skin to baffle connection is important and its pull through strength is an important parameter which needs to be estimated for different fastener types and material configurations. The pull through strength is determined from the maximum load taken by the rivets before the rivets get pulled out through {{the thickness of the}} aluminum plates or before rivet head/bulb failure occurs. This report discusses the test carried out on aluminum plate with different types of rivets and rivet fastening configuration as per ASTM D 7332 procedure. These tests were performed for aluminum plate connected to the test fixture through the following rivets viz., steel, aluminum (heat treated & Non-heat treated) for 2 different diameters.

40|$|Abstract: Damping {{occurring}} {{at the joints}} due to interfacial relative motion is {{the major source of}} inherent damping in fabricated structures. In the present investigation, the dynamic analysis of layered cantilever beams jointed with rivets was carried out using the finite element approach for the Euler–Bernoulli beam model. The solution is based on one-dimensional beam elements, with each element consisting of two nodes having two degrees of freedom (i. e. transverse displacement and rotation) at each node. The cubic shape functions are considered for the transverse vibration of the beam in terms of nodal variables. The stiffness and mass matrices are evaluated from the bending strain energy and kinetic energy of the beam, respectively, which are further used to determine the natural frequency and mode shapes by modal analysis. The damping capacity of the cantilever specimens was computed using the energy approach. Experiments were conducted for validating the numerical results. The results establish that the damping capacity of built-up structures having lower beam thickness ratio and higher cantilever length can be improved substantially using larger <b>diameter</b> <b>rivets</b> at lower amplitude of excitation...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of a riveted lap joint, {{the part}} of M- 28 Skytruck fuselage, is presented. The aim of the paper is a proper choice of finite element mesh {{parameters}} (shape and density) around the rivet hole {{as well as a}} study of the influence of different sheets thickness on secondary bending. Riveting still remains the most popular method of joining metal and composite parts of the aircraft structure. During the operation (service) the severe stress concentrations and the effects such as fretting and secondary bending occur, thus reducing fatigue life. The specimen consists of two thin sheets (0. 6 and 1. 2 mm thick) stiffened with a 3 mm thick frame. The parts are connected by 14 rivets (3. 5 mm <b>diameter)</b> and 8 <b>rivets</b> (3 mm <b>diameter).</b> Overall specimen dimensions are following: length 682 mm, width 136 mm, rivets pitch 17 mm. The riveted joint is subjected to a tensile load. The analysis of large parts of structures like fuselages, wings or multi-row riveted specimens can be performed using global shell models. The correct stress state in global modelling can be obtained by taking into consideration the hole in the sheet, the rivet axis (as a rigid or beam element) and contact elements between the rivet and the hole as well as between the sheets. Deformation of the joint and stress state are calculated. Large difference between sheets thickness causes non-physical deformation of the rivet cross sections. Proper deformations of the joint are obtained by increasing stiffness of those sections in a thinner sheet. Results are compared with an experimental investigation and applied to estimations of specimen fatigue life...|$|R

"Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 62 - 64) This thesis {{presents a}} study of the effect of controllable riveting parameters, mainly squeeze force, rivet length, <b>rivet</b> <b>diameter</b> tolerance, hole countersunk depth and hole diameter tolerance, on the quality of formed rivet. The quality of a formed rivet is determined by the geometry of its head formation {{and the extent to which}} the hole is filled. The study determines maximum allowable tolerance on drilled hole in a 0. 064 ” thick aluminum sheet for a 1 / 8 ” rivet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of the riveting process. Theoretical relations between squeeze force and formed rivet head geometry derived in this study is used to validate the finite element model. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting and determine the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality of formed rivet head. The results demonstrate that the correct formation of rivet head geometry depends upon all the factors studied. However, correct geometry of rivet head is not enough to determine the quality of a riveted joint, because the countersunk rivet head does not expand enough to fill up the hole completely, thereby creating a gap and leading to a loose rivet. The gap increases with the increase in tolerances in drilled hole, limiting its allowable tolerances to 0. 006 ”. The length of rivet has no significant effect on the gap formation. To ensure the elimination of gap formation, an alternate procedure with reduced countersunk depth is studied, which allows for increased allowable tolerance in drilled hole. Results show that with as little as 0. 01 ” reduced countersunk depth, the allowable tolerances on drilled hole could be increased to 0. 03 ”, without compromising on the quality of the joint...|$|E

40|$|The two {{historical}} fuselage failures, Comet in 1954 and Aloha in 1988, {{illustrate that}} similar accidents must be avoided {{which requires a}} profound understanding of the fatigue mechanisms involved, including analytical models to predict the fatigue behavior of riveted joints of a fuselage structure. The scope of the research project covers a variety of joint types and joining techniques for both monolithic and laminated sheet materials. The fuselage structure is a rather complicated system of parts consisting of skin sheets, tear straps, stringers, frames and doublers. These parts are interconnected by mechanically fastened and bonded joints, {{or a combination of}} both. The complex fuselage structure in the present research is reduced to specimen level size for laboratory testing and theoretical analysis. The major topics of the thesis are: Calculations of the combined tension and bending stress distribution in joints, which implies an extension of the so-called secondary bending model (Chapter 3). Find a direct and simple relation between the formed rivet head and squeeze force. (Chapter 4). Development of stress intensity factors for fatigue cracks in joints loaded under combined tension and application to fatigue crack growth results (Chapter 5). Fractographic observations with the scanning electron microscope of crack front shapes occurring in riveted joints under combined tension and bending (Chapter 5). Analysis of the residual strength of joints with fatigue cracks (Chapter 6). Neutral line model For mechanically fastened lap splice and butt joints in a fuselage structure, a dominant load is introduced by the Ground Air Ground (GAG) pressurization cycle. The hoop load is transferred from one skin panel to the next via the fasteners in the joint. The hoop load is offset by eccentricities in the load path, which causes secondary bending. The bending stress is a non-linear function of the applied tension load. The stress system in the joint then encompasses the membrane stress, the secondary bending stress and the bearing stress associated with the fastener loads on the holes. The secondary bending is highly depending on the magnitude of the eccentricity and the flexural rigidity of the joint between the fastener rows. The theory used to derive the bending stresses is based on the advanced beam theory. A further development of the neutral line model incorporates the internal moment, which is a useful representation of the load transfer occurring in multiple row joints. The calculation of the load transfer can be made for complicated lap splice and butt joints. With the developments of the present research, the neutral line model is still a very powerful tool to use {{in the early stages of}} joint design. It gives a good picture of the stresses in a joint. Riveting Solid rivets and more advanced fasteners are still widely used in aircraft fuselage design efforts. The fasteners are characterized by various parameters associated with the fastener material and geometry, sheet material and installation process. The present investigation focuses on solid rivets installed in aluminum and Glare. The expansion of a solid rivet in a rivet hole is important with respect to the fatigue properties of joints. The expanding rivet inside a fastener hole will create a compressive residual stress around the hole and this will delay fatigue crack nucleation. It is important to know the correct squeeze force used to form the driven head of a rivet. Measurements of the formed <b>rivet</b> head (<b>diameter</b> or protruding height) can be used to obtain information about the applied squeezing force. The riveting process is a non linear deformation process characterized by large plastic strains. Simple equations based on constant volume of the rivet and the Holloman model for uniform plastic deformation, were adopted to evaluate the riveting process. Useful results were obtained about the correlation between the rivet head deformation and the applied squeezing force. Stress intensity factors As a result of combined tension and secondary bending in a lap joint, fatigue cracks at the edge of a hole start at one side of the sheet only. Initially these cracks at the edge of a hole are growing as a part through the thickness corner crack, which later become a through the thickness crack, a so called through crack. But also for a through crack, the shape of the crack front is usually curved and the crack length measured at both sides of the sheet will be different. In view of fatigue crack growth predictions it then is necessary to obtain stress intensity factors for such slant and curved crack fronts. In the present investigation this problem has been explored for a simple configuration, which is an open hole in a sheet specimen subjected to combined tension and bending. Fatigue tests were carried out on specimens of AL 2024 T 3 clad sheet material with three different thicknesses (1. 0, 1. 6 and 2. 0 mm). In each specimen a single open countersunk hole was present. The development of the crack front is these specimens could be recorded because so-called marker load cycles were applied in these tests. It then was possible to observe the crack fronts in the scanning electron microscope, which still was a rather strenuous work. Reconstruction of the crack growth could be done for the larger part of the fatigue cracks. K-values were obtained for a large variety of crack front shapes and crack sizes. Comparison of the new calculated K values with existing solutions showed that the new solutions capture near the surface phenomenon more accurately than the previously published data. The improvement is a result of using an increased mesh density. For through the thickness cracks growing away from the countersunk hole, the normalized stress intensity factors approach the values of the normalized stress intensity factors for cracks emanating from a straight shank hole. Thus, the effect of the countersunk hole decreases with increasing crack length. The solutions for the pin loading b values show a dominant influence of the countersunk shape in the b/t values. Residual strength Static failure of a joint occurs when that joint is not able to carry the applied load anymore. The type of static failure in joints depends on the loading condition and the joint configuration. The most common static failure modes in monolithic aluminum joints are fastener shear failure, plate tension failure, bearing failure and plate shear failure. In Glare joints another failure mechanism, fastener pull-through, is often observed. This failure mechanism is related to the lower stiffness of Glare in thickness direction, leading to increased tilting of the fasteners and hence increased tensile stresses in the fastener. In the present thesis, a method is proposed to calculate the residual strength of joints of monolithic and fiber metal laminates. The method uses the remaining net section. For the fiber metal laminates the net section includes the remaining intact metal layers in combination with the intact fibers. The method starts with the blunt notch strength of the un cracked joint and the metal volume fraction for the fiber-metal laminates. The Norris failure criterion and the metal volume fraction are used to calculate the blunt notch strength for any possible Glare lay up. Secondary bending has a significant influence on the ultimate strength of both Glare and aluminum. The ultimate tensile strength reduces with increasing bending. Taking this into account, an empirically found reduction of 10...|$|R
