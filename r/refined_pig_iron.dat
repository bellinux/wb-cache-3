50|$|Traditionally, {{pig iron}} was worked into wrought iron in finery forges, later {{puddling}} furnaces, {{and more recently}} into steel. In these processes, pig iron is melted and a strong current of air is directed over it while it is stirred or agitated. This causes the dissolved impurities (such as silicon) to be thoroughly oxidized. An intermediate product of puddling is known as <b>refined</b> <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> finers metal, or refined iron.|$|E
50|$|Before the Bessemer process, Western Europe and the United States {{relied on}} the {{puddling}} process to reduce the carbon content of white cast iron (<b>refined</b> <b>pig</b> <b>iron),</b> converting it to wrought iron. It was possible to make low-quality puddled steel, but the process was difficult to control and quality varied. High-quality steel {{was made by the}} reverse process of adding carbon to carbon-free wrought iron, usually imported from Sweden. The manufacturing process, called the cementation process, consisted of heating bars of wrought iron together with charcoal for periods of up to a week in a long stone box. This produced blister steel. The blister steel was put in a crucible with wrought iron and melted, producing crucible steel. Up to 3 tons of expensive coke was burnt for each ton of steel produced. Such steel when rolled into bars was sold at £50 to £60 (approximately £3,390 to £4,070 in 2008) a long ton. The most difficult and work-intensive part of the process, however, was the production of wrought iron done in finery forges in Sweden.|$|E

50|$|The results {{varied from}} region to region.

2500|$|Peter Grubb was {{not really}} an ironmaster, but a builder. [...] In 1745 he leased the {{ironworks}} to a consortium, Cury and Company, for 25 years and returned to Wilmington. The consortium continued the operation, with ownership passing to Peter's sons, Curtis and Peter Jr., {{after his death in}} 1754. The brothers took over the operation in 1765 and ran it quite successfully until the late 1780s. Curtis operated the Cornwall Furnace and lived on site; c1773 he built the original 19 rooms of the mansion that still stands prominently next to the property. Peter Jr. ran a forge at Hopewell, <b>refining</b> the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> produced by the furnace into more valuable bar iron. [...] The ironworks were major suppliers to the Revolutionary War effort, and George Washington once visited to inspect the operation. Unfortunately for the Grubb family, as described in [...] Curtis Grubb's biography, they were unable to retain control of the operation after Curtis' marriage in 1783. Most of the Grubb's holdings gradually fell into the hands of Robert Coleman, culminating in 1798. Coleman's son, William, was named manager of Cornwall Furnace and lived in the mansion; in 1865 the Colemans remodeled it into the 29 room structure known today as Buckingham Mansion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> {{can also}} be used to produce gray iron.

40|$|The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget {{process was}} {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to the traditional blast furnace process by Kobe Steel. The process aimed to produce <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets, which have similar chemical and physical properties to blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> in a single step. The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget process utilizes coal instead of coke and self reducing and fluxing dried green balls instead of pellets and sinters. In this process the environmental emissions caused by coke and sinter production, and energy lost between pellet induration (heat hardening) and transportation to the blast furnace can be eliminated. The objectives of this research were to (1) produce <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets in the laboratory, (2) characterize the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget produced and compare them with blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> (3) investigate the furnace temperature and residence time effects on the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget production, and (4) optimize the operational furnace temperatures and residence times. The experiments involved heat treatment of self reducing and fluxing dried green balls at various furnace temperatures and residence times. Three chemically and physically different products were produced after the compete reduction of iron oxides to iron depending on the operational furnace temperatures and/or residence times. These products were direct reduced iron (DRI), transition direct reduced <b>iron</b> (TDRI), and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets. The increase in the carbon content of the system as a function of furnace temperature and/or residence time dictated the formation of these products. The direct reduced iron, transition direct reduced <b>iron,</b> and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets produced were analyzed for their chemical composition, degree of metallization, apparent density, microstructure and microhardness. In addition, the change in the carbon content of the system with the changing furnace temperature and/or residence time was detected by optical microscopy and Microhardness measurements. The sufficient carbon dissolution required for the production of <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets was determined. It was determined that <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets produced had a high apparent density (6. 7 - 7. 2 gr/cm 3), highly metallized, slag free structure, high iron content (95 - 97 %), high microhardness values (> 325 HVN) and microstructure similar to white cast iron.

50|$|<b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> is an {{intermediate}} {{product of the}} <b>iron</b> industry. <b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> has a very high carbon content, typically 3.5-4.5%, along with silica and other constituents of dross, which makes it very brittle, and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications. <b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> is made by smelting iron ore into a transportable ingot of impure high carbon-content iron in a blast furnace as an ingredient for further processing steps. The traditional shape of the molds used for <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> ingots was a branching structure formed in sand, with many individual ingots {{at right angles to}} a central channel or runner, resembling a litter of piglets being suckled by a sow. When the metal had cooled and hardened, the smaller ingots (the pigs) were simply broken from the runner (the sow), hence the name <b>pig</b> <b>iron.</b> As <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is intended for remelting, the uneven size of the ingots and the inclusion of small amounts of sand caused only insignificant problems considering the ease of casting and handling them.|$|R

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages, <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought <b>iron.</b> Because <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the liquid <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> to create steel.
