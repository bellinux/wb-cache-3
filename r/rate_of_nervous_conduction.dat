According {{to their}} severity, mechanical trauma induce reversible/irreversible changes <b>of</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>conduction</b> {{due to the}} membrane pore formation at the injury site followed {{by the loss of}} nerve membrane integrity and function. The present study was aimed at assessing functional recovery of peripheral nerves subjected to in vitro injury by severe compression after local application of sonicated lipid emulsion (SLE). METHODS: Sciatic nerves isolated from Sprague Dawley rats (250 - 350 g) were randomly assigned to 2 groups: Controls (n = 6) and SLE treated group (n = 6). Isolated sciatic nerves were incubated and electrically stimulated using Ag/AgCl electrodes (I= 1 mA) in double sucrose gap recording chamber. Both groups were subjected to severe injury by continuous compression with a glass rod vertically manipulated by an electrical micromanipulator. The compression was maintained 15 sec. after the cessation of electrical nerve response known as the compound action potential (CAP). In SLE treated group 2, the lipid emulsion was applied at the site of injury for 4 minutes. After inducing the severe lesion sciatic nerves in Controls were incubated in saline solution for a similar time interval. The evaluation of functional recovery was performed using electrophysiological recordings for 2 hours. RESULTS: In all injured nerves from the SLE group, 30 - 40 minutes following lipid application, an electrical response (CAP) was recorded. The CAP signal showed a trend fo...|$|R

Material and methods: Using the ECLAMC protocol, every malformed newborn or stillbirth, weighing more than 500 g at birth is registered using a standard protocol, and the next non malformed child of the same sex born in the same hospital is assigned as control. Results: The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> central <b>nervous</b> system congenital malformations are higher at the University of Chile Clinical Hospital than in the rest of Chilean hospitals or Latin American Hospitals.

40|$|Sensorimotor EEG shows ∼ 20 Hz {{coherence}} with contralateral EMG. This {{could involve}} efferent and/or afferent {{components of the}} sensorimotor loop. We investigated the pathways responsible for coherence genesis by manipulating <b>nervous</b> <b>conduction</b> delays using cooling. Coherence between left sensorimotor EEG and right EMG from three hand and two forearm muscles was assessed in healthy subjects during the hold phase of a precision grip task. The right arm was then cooled to 10 °C for ∼ 90 min, increasing peripheral motor conduction time (PMCT) by ∼ 35 % (assessed by F-wave latency). EEG and EMG recordings were repeated, and coherence recalculated. Control recordings revealed a heterogeneous subject population. In 6 / 15 subjects (Group A), the corticomuscular coherence phase increased linearly with frequency, as expected if oscillations were propagated along efferent pathways from cortex to muscle. The mean corticomuscular conduction delay for intrinsic hand muscles calculated from the phase–frequency regression slope was 10. 4 ms; this is smaller than the delay expected for conduction over fast corticospinal pathways. In 8 / 15 subjects (Group B), the phase showed no dependence with frequency. One subject showed both Group A and Group B patterns over different frequency ranges. Following cooling, averaged corticomuscular coherence was decreased in Group A subjects, but unchanged for Group B, even though both groups showed comparable slowing <b>of</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>conduction.</b> The delay calculated from {{the slope of the}} phase–frequency regression was increased following cooling. However, the size of this increase was around twice the rise in PMCT measured using the F-wave (regression slope 2. 33, 95 % confidence limits 1. 30 – 3. 36). Both afferent and efferent peripheral nerves will be slowed by similar amounts following cooling. The change in delay calculated from the coherence phase therefore better matches the rise in total sensorimotor feedback loop time caused by cooling, rather than just the change in the efferent limb. A model of corticomuscular coherence which assumes that only efferent pathways contribute cannot be reconciled to these results. The data rather suggest that afferent feedback pathways may also {{play a role in the}} genesis of corticomuscular coherence...|$|R

The effects of the venom on cholinergic and glutamatergic synapses were studied using e 1 ectrophysiological techniques. Philanthus toxin at a very low concentration (0. 04 unit/ml) had marked effects on the cholinergic postsynaptic current. The venom inhibited the peak miniature endplate current (MEPe) amplitude of frog sartorius muscle with slight nonlinearity in the current-voltage relationship. Moreover, it reduced the time constant of MEPC decay ('tMEPC) 'The effects of Philanthus venom on the glutamatergic synapse were studied using metathoracic flexor and extensor muscles oflocust. In the presence of philanthotoxin (0. 5 unit), significant voltage dependent depression of the endplate current (EPC) peak amplitude was recorded. There was a marked depression of the decay time constant of the EPC. The toxin (0. 5 unit/ml) depressed the peak amplitude of MEPC and reduced the MEPC time constant.

The aim of our work was to assess whether electrophysiological abnormalities in visual function exist in newly-diagnosed diabetic patients free of any fluorangiographic signs of retinopathy. Ten control subjects (age 28. 7 +/- 2. 44 years) and ten IDDM: patients (age 25. 2 +/- 6. 78 years; disease duration 5. 3 +/- 3. 5 months) in stable metabolic control (HbA(1 C) 7. 5 +/- 1. 1 %) were evaluated.

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{organization of}} the brain of frogs and salamanders varies greatly in {{the degree to which}} it is subdivided and differentiated. Members of these taxa are visually oriented predators, but the morphological complexity of the visual centers in the brain varies interspecifically. We give evidence that the morphological complexity of the amphibian tectum mesencephali, the main visual center, can be predicted from knowledge of cell size, which varies greatly among these taxa. Further, cell size is highly correlated with genome size. Frogs with small cells have more complex morphologies of the tectum than do those with large cells independent of body and brain size. In contrast, in salamanders brain-body size relationships also are correlated with morphological complexity of the brain. Small salamanders with large cells have the simplest tecta, whereas large salamanders with small cells exhibit the most complex tectal morphologies. Increases in genome, and consequently cell size, are associated with a decrease in the differentiation <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>nervous</b> tissue, which leads to the observed differences in brain morphology.

METHODS: The protocol at T 1 consisted of motor nerve conduction studies of median, ulnar, peroneal and tibial nerves bilaterally, with measurement of (a) motor response size (amplitude and area); (b) terminal latency; (c) minimal, mean and maximal F-wave latency; (d) motor conduction velocity; and (e) F-wave occurrence. T 1 also involved sensory nerve conduction studies of median, ulnar, radial, lateral and medial cutaneous, sural and superficial peroneal nerves bilaterally, with measurement of sensory potential size (amplitude and area) and computation of sensory conduction velocity.

The compromising of the skeletal striated muscle in leprosy has been characterized {{as a result of}} the presence of peripheral neuropathy with subsequent muscular denervation. However many authors have published many studies in which they demonstrate the presence of primary muscular involvement in the disease, characterizing the so called "Leprous Interstitial Myositis". With the aim of analysing the alterations of the skeletal striated muscle in our ambience, a prospective study was put in to practice with 40 patients who had a established diagnosis of leprosy, through a neurological clinical exam, an electromyographic exam of the tibialis anterior muscle, a sutdy <b>of</b> the <b>nervous</b> <b>conduction</b> <b>of</b> the peroneal nerve and through the biopsy of the tibialis anterior muscle by a histological/histochemical analysis. The basic objectives of the study were : 1) to analyse the histologic repercussions in the tibialis anterior muscle by histochemistry; 2) to relate the histologic alterations of the muscles with the data found in the electromyographic study. Of the 40 patients studied 85 % are males and 15 % are females and their average age is 45. 6 years. The medium tim e of the diasease is 3. 2 years. 57, 5 % of the patients are carriers of the lepromatous form, 32, 5 % of the tuberculoid form, 5 % of the borderline form and 5 % of the indeterminate form. The neurological exam revealed itself normal in 7, 5 % of the cases, but 10 % showed the presence of mononeuropathy, 25 % of peripheral polineuropathy and 57, 5 % of mononeuritis multiplex. The electromyographic exam of the tibialis anterior muscle was normal in 15 % of the cases. Signs of denervation (ative and chronic) were found in 77, 5 % of the cases and limitrophe signs for denervation in 7, 5 % of the cases. The study <b>of</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>conduction</b> in the peroneal nerves demonstrated its reduction or absence with great frequency; as well as a reduction of the amplitude of motor response. The biopsy of the tibialis anterior musde evaluated by histochemical technique r@velead signs of denervation in 45 % of the cases, of interstitial inflammatory myopathy in 30 % (where 17. 5 % of the cases showed the presence of the add-alcohol fast badllus-AFB), of mixed pattern (myopathic and neuropathic) in 12. 5 %, and non-specific data in 12. 5 % of the cases. The presence of AFB in the musde was detected in 25 % od the cases. The inflamatory access of the tibialis anterior musde, mainly interstitial (with or without of AFB), was observed predominantly in the patients who had the lepromatous form. The results of electromyography were related to the ones of the muscular biopsy through statistical study by test and a quite positive relation was observed (p between 0. 01 and 0. 001) among the following variables: positive fibers in the add phosphatases and increased insertional activity, fibrillations and complex repetitives discharges in the total group of patients w ith leprosy. The proliferation of conjunctive tissue (in haematoxylin and eosin and modified gomori trichrome) was related (p between 0. 01 and 0. 001) with the presence of fibrillation potentials in the total group of patients. The data of the histologscal/histochemicai study of the tibialis anterior musde in 40 patients with leprosy define dearly the presence (among others alterations) of the so called "Leprous Interstitial Myositis"in a very representative way. Relacionaram-se os resultados da eletrom iografia com os da biópsia muscuíer, através do estudo estatístico pelo Qui-quadrado e observou-se uma relação bastante positiva (p entre 0, 01 e> 0, 001) entre as seguintes variáveis: fibras positivas na fosfatas© ácida e atividade de inserção aumentada, fibriíaçoes e descargas de alta frequência, no grupo tota! de pacientes com hans-sníase. Ã proliferação de tecido conjuntivo (na hematoxilina-eosina e no trlcrom o de Qomori modificado) reladonou-se (p entre 0, 01 e 0, 001) com a presença de fibriiações, no grupo totai de padentes. Os achados do estudo histológico/histoquímico do músculo tibial anterior, em 40 padentes com hanseníase, definem de forma dara a presença (entre outras alterações) da chamada "Miosite Inierstidal Leprosa", de maneira bastante representativa...|$|R
40|$|Interferon alfa 2 (IFN-α 2) is a parenterally {{administered}} cytokine used {{to treat}} patients with Hepatitis C and B, and malignancy. Interferon (INF) has a relatively high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> central <b>nervous</b> system (CNS) adverse effects, including agitation, depression, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, suicidal thought and drug craving. Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) we studied patients with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who were not more than mildly clinically depressed at baseline for their CNS reaction to IFN-α 2. During fMRI, patients underwent visual stimulation with pictures designed to induce feelings of depression. In the two patients who became clinically depressed or markedly anxious while on treatment with interferon, but not in patients who did not experience these effects, there was a significant activation in specific areas of the brain known to be involved with depression, along with an increase above baseline in the Beck Depression Scale for the patient who developed INF-induced depression. The activation pattern differed from that previously observed for endogenous depression, indicating that INF-induced depression may differ in its underlying neuropathology. Functional magnetic resonance imaging can be an important tool in understanding and monitoring for (INF and other) medication-induced CNS effects, and response to treatment...|$|R
40|$|Metastases from {{prostate}} cancer occur largely in bone through a haematogenous route. Metastatic spread of {{prostate cancer}} to the leptomeninges was rarely seen in the past. However, {{there has been a}} recent increase in presentations of leptomeningeal spread from prostate cancer in our institutions. Between 2004 and 2006, four patients were diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer with leptomeningeal metastases in our centres. All four patients had hormone refractory prostate cancer and had previously had chemotherapy. The median survival of these patients was approximately 15 months from the time of hormone refractoriness. The prognosis of leptomeningeal metastasis secondary to metastatic prostate cancer is poor, ranging from 2 to 7 months as seen in our series. New cases of leptomeningeal metastases seen in our series are hypothesized to be secondary to the use of effective modern systemic treatments. A parallel might be drawn with the increased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> central <b>nervous</b> system metastases in breast cancer since the introduction of effective cytotoxic treatments and more recently targeted therapies. We suggest the clinicians {{to be aware of the}} potential change of natural history and pattern of progression in metastatic prostate cancer. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study aims to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of performing an anatomy scanned for fetal abnormalities {{at the time of}} nuchal translucency (NT) measurement in Vietnamese population Material and methods: In a prospective study, 2500 singleton pregnancies measured fetal NT and scanned structural anatomy in the first trimester; then checked fetal morphology systematically at 18 - 24 weeks and followed up to their delivery. According to ultrasonographic abnormalities and amniocentesis, we evaluated the detection <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ultrasound for aneuploidy in the first and second trimester of gestation. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for aneuploidy was 17. 2 % and 99. 7 %, respectively. All 13 cases of fetal ultrasonographic anomalies related significantly with an increased NT (≥ 2. 4 mm) (p < 0. 001). 30. 8 % of these abnormalities that included cystic hygroma, omphalocele and holoprosencephaly were detected at 11 - 13. 6 weeks’ gestation. In the second trimester scanning, 69. 2 % of major structural anomalies found and the detection <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> central <b>nervous</b> system malformation, abnormal heart, abdominal wall defect, face anomaly and skeletal deformities were 85. 7 %, 100 %, 66. 7 %, 50 % and 75 %, alternatively. Conclusion: Scanning of fetal anatomy at the time of NT measuring is useful to detect fetal abnormalities, especially aneuploidy in Vietnamese pregnancies. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} hypothesised role of psychobiological personality dimensions in shaping specific health-related behaviours and propositions potential health communications. The primary {{aim was to}} investigate Eysenck’s and Gray’s personality dimensions in relationship to specific smoking, alcohol-use, substance-use, physical exercise and eating behaviours. Past research has either focussed on a narrow range of behaviours or examined the relation between personality, health behaviours and message interventions insufficiently. It is argued that most health behaviours are a function of psychophysiological processes and social learning, and future research should find them differentially conditionable by appropriate punishment- or reward-oriented messages. The dissertation draws on the Hippocrates-Galen-Avicennic tradition and the works of Pavlov, Skinner, Mowrer, Eysenck and Gray, and examines the previously ignored work of Avicenna on human temperament and emotions. A taxonomy of health-related behaviours and a framework for health communication and behaviour change are presented. The behavioural taxonomy of Indulgent-Denial, Delinquent-Inert, and Escape-Maintenance is assessable by physiological and psychological markers, and corresponds to Eysenck’s three-dimensional personality structure. The partly validated model explains behavioural variations by composites <b>of</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>conduction</b> and reactivity <b>of</b> behavioural systems in the brain, and also outlines possible communication interventions. The dissertation is anchored in positivism, assuming intrinsic biogenetic influences as the psychophysiological reality. A retrospective Study consisting of a single cross-sectional survey explored the multivariate relationship between the psychobiological personality dimensions and health-related behaviours in a student sample. In line with the protocols approved by the Ethics Committee, two standard personality instruments, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised and the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire, and an especially developed Behavioural Questionnaire provided the self-report measurements. Demographic effects on behavioural and personality variables were discovered by chi-square tests and two-way {{multivariate analysis of variance}} respectively, associations between variables were observed by correlational analysis, likelihood of a specific behaviour on the basis of personality variables was examined by a logistic model, and health diagnostic accuracies of personality measures were assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. It was found that high Extraversion and high Psychoticism scorers, and so Indulgent and Delinquent Behaviours were more likely to show appetitive associations, whereas high Neuroticism scorers and thereby Escape Behaviours were more likely to show aversive associations. All Eysenckian dimensions revealed low-to-moderate Reward-sensitivity while Neuroticism showed combined strengths of Punishment- and Reward-sensitivity. The intercorrelations of personality dimensions supported Gray that the Eysenckian dimensions probably represent unequal mixtures of Punishment- and Reward-sensitivity. The associations between personality and behaviours indicate Reward-sensitivity and Psychoticism as the most useful personality disorder dimensions, and the research questions the often-attributed role of Extraversion as a cardinal well-being dimension. Statistically and practically significant relationships between Extraversion and alcohol-use, Psychoticism and heavy alcohol-use, Psychoticism and substance-use, Psychoticism and heavy substance-use, and Neuroticism and binge-eating were observed, but the health diagnostic accuracies of personality measures were mostly poor and the correlations and odds ratios between personality and behavioural data were subject to a ceiling effect. The thesis questions whether personality measures may be a data collection method and not a diagnostic test for health-related behaviours. It is argued that personality data alone may be of insufficient diagnostic value in clinical decision-making and healthcare setting. Thus, the dissertation asserts that health-risk behaviours will be best understood when examined in relation to the reinforcement-sensitive behavioural systems in brain and the contexts in which these behaviours occur. A psychophysiological framework of behavioural assessment and modification is advisable instead of strict personality-based models or a one-size-fits-all approach, in view of theoretical and empirical knowledge about the neuronal growth through life, nerve physiology, early childhood development, relationships between conscious and unconscious processes, the anachronistic assumption of immutability of personality traits as risk factors, results of the data analysis and the observation that health-risk behaviours are of different types and should entail differential emotional appeals. The thesis has created an architecture for future behavioural research with an emphasis on systematic punishment- or reward-oriented health communication interventions, an area that has received comparatively little empirical attention.

The Swedish Family-Cancer Database was used to calculate age-standardized incidence rates. We {{compared the}} age-standardized incidence rates for immigrants {{with those in the}} Cancer Incidence in Five Continents report. All-cancer rates were decreased in Turks (men) and Chileans and increased in NAs compared with the residents in their countries <b>of</b> origin. The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> stomach cancer in Chileans and lung cancer in Turkish men were decreased, whereas Turkish women had an increased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> lung cancer. Furthermore, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer in Turks and NAs and nervous system tumors in NA men and Turkish women were increased.

40|$|The {{registered}} incidence <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> childhood central <b>nervous</b> system (CNS) tumours {{has increased}} in several countries. It is uncertain whether these increases are biologically real or owing to improved diagnostic methods. We explored the medical records of 626 CNS tumours diagnosed in Danish children between 1980 and 1996. Population-based registers were used to extract data on mortality and background population. Temporal patterns were analysed by regression techniques. Most tumours were verified by computed tomography (78 %) or magnetic resonance imaging (14 %). Overall, the incidence rate increased by 2. 9 % per year (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 3; 4. 5) and the mortality rate increased by 1. 4 % per year (95 % CI: − 0. 4; 3. 3). Among children aged 0 – 4 years, the survival rate after diagnosis remained almost unchanged, whereas among children aged 5 – 14 years, the 10 -year survival rate improved from 59 to 74 %. These {{data suggest that the}} incidence <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> CNS tumours among Danish children has truly increased, although alternative explanations cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} I {{put forward a}} {{reconstruction}} {{of the evolution of}} certain explanatory hypotheses on the neural basis of association and learning that are the premises of connectionism in the cybernetic age and of present-day connectionism. The main point of my reconstruction is based on two little-known case studies. The first is the project, published in 1913, of a hydraulic machine through which its author believed it was possible to simulate certain &quot;essential elements &quot; of the plasticity <b>of</b> <b>nervous</b> connections. The author, S. Bent Russell, was an engineer deeply influenced by the neurological hypotheses on <b>nervous</b> <b>conduction</b> <b>of</b> Herbert Spencer, Max Meyer and Edward L. Thorndike. The second is the project, published in 1929, of an electromechanical machine in which the author, the psychologist J. M. Stephens, believed it was possible to embody Thorndike&quot;s law of effect. Thus both Bent Russell and Stephens referred to the principles of learning that Thorndike defined as &quot;connectionist&quot;. Their attempt was that of simulating by machines at least certain simple aspects of inhibition, association and habit formation that are typical of living organisms. I propose to situate their projects within the frame of the discovery of a simulative (modelling) methodology which I believe might be considered an important topic of the &quot;Culture of the Artificial&quot;. Certain more recent steps toward such a methodology made by both connectionism of the 1950 s and present-day connectionism are briefly pointed out in the paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of ionic movements in excitable tissues has been emphasized {{by a number}} of recent experiments. On the one hand, there is the finding that the nervous impulse is associated with an inflow of sodium and an outflow of potassiuim (e. g. Rothenberg, 1950; Keynes & Lewis, 1951). On the other, there are experiments which show that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> rise and amplitude of the action potential are determined by the concentration of sodium in the external medium (e. g. Hodgkin & Katz, 1949 a; Huxley & Stiimpffi, 1951). Both groups of experiments are consistent with the theory that <b>nervous</b> <b>conduction</b> depends on a specific increase in permeability which allows sodium ions to move from the more concentrated solution outside a nerve fibre to the more dilute solution inside it. This movement of charge makes the inside of the fibre positive and provides a satisfactory explanation for the rising phase of the spike. Repolarization during the falling phase probably depends on an outflow of potassium ions and may be accelerated by a process which increases the potassium permeability after the action potential has reached its cres...|$|R
