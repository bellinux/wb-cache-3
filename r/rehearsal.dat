5|$|One of the {{constant}} difficulties of London orchestras {{was the lack of}} good <b>rehearsal</b> space and facilities. In 1973, acting jointly with the LSO, the LPO acquired and began restoring a disused church in Southwark, converting it into the Henry Wood Hall, a convenient and acoustically excellent <b>rehearsal</b> space and recording studio, opened in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The lack of good <b>rehearsal</b> {{facilities}} to which Bernstein had objected was {{addressed in the}} 1970s when, jointly with the LPO, the LSO acquired and restored a disused church in Southwark, converting it into the Henry Wood Hall, a convenient and acoustically excellent <b>rehearsal</b> space and recording studio, opened in 1975.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rehearsals</b> for {{the live}} episode started {{one week in}} advance. During <b>rehearsals,</b> Stephen Mulhern {{pre-recorded}} some <b>rehearsals</b> and interviewed some of {{the cast and crew}} for the aftershow which aired straight after on ITV2 at 8pm.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rehearsals</b> {{are also}} used to teach {{ensemble}} members about music history and basic performance practice, {{so that they can}} learn the different playing styles and tones used in music from different eras. As well, orchestra conductors select pieces so that players can learn new skills, such as more complicated rhythms. For an amateur ensemble, the <b>rehearsals</b> are used to give the players an opportunity to have repeated chances to learn to perform difficult passages in an ensemble context. Amateur choirs use <b>rehearsals</b> to build choral singing skills, such as singing with a good ensemble and with solid intonation and vocal tone. Amateur groups are much more likely than professional groups to hold sectional <b>rehearsals.</b> Another difference between <b>rehearsals</b> in an amateur orchestra and a professional orchestra is the number of <b>rehearsals.</b> A community orchestra or university ensemble may have ten or even fifteen <b>rehearsals</b> over several months to prepare a major symphony; a professional orchestra might prepare that same symphony in two <b>rehearsals</b> over two days.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} have <b>rehearsals</b> the three would skip school. The <b>rehearsals</b> were held at the {{boiler-room}} in their building. The three had <b>rehearsals</b> there for about ten years. They held a free gig at the Dadov's upper floor.|$|R

5|$|The tryouts in Cleveland {{were at the}} Hanna Theatre. The dress <b>rehearsal</b> {{the night}} before the initial {{performance}} revealed a number of problems with the show; during the first act alone, Hammerstein dictated eight pages of notes. The sandbag which falls from the light bridge near the end of Act 1 dropped off-cue, nearly striking Isabel Bigley, who played Jeanie. Pett remembered that the <b>rehearsal</b> was stopped often, as Rodgers sought to work out each problem as it arose, and the <b>rehearsal,</b> which began at 8p.m. lasted until 2a.m.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} six <b>rehearsal</b> studios {{with high}} ceilings and no obstructions. The Joffrey could use these for classes if it starts a school here. For now {{they will be}} the site of activities related to the Joffrey's extensive outreach school programs.|$|E
50|$|Band <b>rehearsals</b> are {{scheduled}} on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm at Stoll Field, Shively Field, and inside of Nutter Field house. <b>Rehearsals</b> on home game days begin five hours before kickoff and {{last one to}} two hours. Game day <b>rehearsals</b> are held at Shively Field or, in case of bad weather, inside the Nutter Field House. No extra <b>rehearsals</b> {{are scheduled}}.|$|R
40|$|Open <b>rehearsals</b> are {{not just}} an {{audience}} development strategy. They change public understanding of how art is made. Whether online or in person, open <b>rehearsals</b> are becoming a regular event for professional dance companies in Australia and overseas. Where, previously, open <b>rehearsals</b> were reserved for company donors and, in some cases, student groups, {{the past decade and}} a half have seen open <b>rehearsals</b> opened to the general public as a strategy for audience development and education [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Pop, rock, {{country and}} blues bands rehearse before performances. <b>Rehearsals</b> {{assemble}} {{the elements of}} a musical event, offering an experimental space where sounds are put together and taken apart, played with, argued over. In these styles of music, <b>rehearsals</b> may be less formal than in a Classical orchestra context. However, the purpose of <b>rehearsals</b> is the same: to ensure that all the band members can play and/or sing their parts with a good rhythmic ensemble, correct intonation, and the right [...] "feel". As with Classical <b>rehearsals,</b> the earlier <b>rehearsals</b> for a show often focus more on working out the most difficult sections of songs, such as transitions from one tempo to another tempo, modulations to a new key, or coordinating a duet between two solo instruments. The <b>rehearsals</b> closer to the performance are more likely to involve run-throughs of entire songs. Whereas Classical <b>rehearsals</b> are led by the conductor or choir leader, popular music band <b>rehearsals</b> are typically led by the bandleader, who is typically a member of the band. The bandleader sets the tempos for songs, chooses which instruments will have solos, and cues the start of new sections of a song.|$|R
5|$|Dress <b>rehearsal</b> for {{the sketch}} went poorly. During <b>rehearsal,</b> Belushi was having {{difficulty}} correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up {{so that he would}} look the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able to}} pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E
5|$|During <b>rehearsal,</b> Marge {{struggles with}} {{a scene in}} which Blanche is {{supposed}} to break a glass bottle and attack Stanley, but she cannot muster enough anger towards Stanley to break the bottle. After coming home, Marge asks Homer to help her learn her lines, but Homer is uninterested. The day before the performance, Marge and Ned are again practising the bottle scene as Homer arrives to drive Marge home. Homer repeatedly interrupts the <b>rehearsal.</b> Imagining that Stanley is Homer, Marge finally smashes the bottle and lunges at Ned.|$|E

50|$|Each of {{the shows}} of the {{performance}} season has preparation period of approximately twelve to thirteen weeks; consisting of weekly three-hour <b>rehearsals.</b> In addition to the weekly <b>rehearsals,</b> {{there may be a}} number of sectional/full chorus/dance/solo <b>rehearsals</b> that take place during each preparation period, at the request/discretion of the artistic director.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rehearsals</b> {{were held}} for the honor guard on June 9. The general <b>rehearsals</b> took place on June 11th, 13th, 16th, 18th, 21st and 23rd.|$|R
5|$|<b>Rehearsals</b> {{with the}} full Spider set were staged in Rotterdam's Ahoy Stadium {{starting}} on 18 May before moving to De Kuip stadium for the dress <b>rehearsals</b> (27 and 28 May). Due to relatively {{easy access to the}} venues during <b>rehearsals,</b> fans knew what the set list for the show would be before the tour even opened.|$|R
5|$|In 1982 a {{collection}} of out-takes and <b>rehearsal</b> recordings from the 1972–1975 hiatus was released (initially on cassette only), called Time Vaults. These are not studio-quality recordings.|$|E

5|$|The BBC regime brought {{immediate}} benefits. The use of {{the second}} half of concerts to promote Chappell's songs ceased, to be replaced by music chosen for its own excellence: on the first night under the BBC's control, the songs in the second half were by Schubert, Quilter and Parry rather than ballads from Chappell's. For Wood, the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him twice as much <b>rehearsal</b> time as he had previously enjoyed. He now had a daily <b>rehearsal</b> and extra rehearsals as needed. He was also allowed extra players when large scores called for them, instead of having to rescore the work for the forces available.|$|E
30|$|<b>Rehearsals</b> {{were part}} of the {{original}} TLP model. However, the model included <b>rehearsals</b> of VBDs, not facilitation of the math tasks. Because the curriculum was so new to these TLs, as was the approach of teaching with tasks, we added <b>rehearsals</b> of “Doing the Math” in both TLP 1 – 1 and TLP 2 – 1.|$|R
50|$|Private <b>rehearsals</b> {{started in}} late January 2012 at the Expo Theater in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, {{the same site}} where <b>rehearsals</b> were held for the Tunnel of Love Express Tour and the Rising Tour. Some <b>rehearsals</b> were held at the Sun National Bank Center in Trenton to allow the band and crew to try a new stage design.|$|R
50|$|All <b>rehearsals</b> for {{the tour}} took place in Toronto, Ontario, in a private school; for the full stage <b>rehearsals,</b> a hangar at Pearson International Airport was rented.|$|R

5|$|The {{order in}} which each country {{announced}} their vote was determined in a draw following the jury results from final dress <b>rehearsal.</b> Similar to the 2011 contest an algorithm was used to add as much excitement as possible. The spokespersons are shown alongside each country.|$|E
50|$|Tech <b>rehearsals</b> {{generally}} are {{broken down into}} four types: dry tech <b>rehearsals,</b> tech <b>rehearsals,</b> pick-up tech <b>rehearsals,</b> and paper tech. They consist of fully testing {{out all of the}} technology being used in the performance (lighting, sound, automation, special effects ((e.g. pyrotechnics), etc.) to diagnose and prevent mistakes from occurring during the actual performance. It also gives the designers the opportunity to see how their designs will impact each other (i.e. how the color of a light might affect the look of a costume), and to make final changes.|$|R
25|$|Before {{each of the}} semi-finals three dress <b>rehearsals</b> {{are held}}. Two <b>rehearsals</b> are held the day before (one in the {{afternoon}} and the other in the evening), while the third is held on the afternoon of the live event. Since tickets to the live shows are often scarce, tickets are also sold so the public may attend these dress <b>rehearsals.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between teacher language use and student quality of experience during choral <b>rehearsals.</b> Particularly at the middle school level, few data exist about the ways in which instructional discourse during <b>rehearsals</b> affects student experience. Existing research suggests the use of instructional scaffolding as effective in enhancing student learning and experience, but this had not been previously investigated during music <b>rehearsals.</b> The language of two teachers during 20 <b>rehearsals</b> was recorded and examined for evidence of instructional scaffolding and sequential units of instruction; student self-reports of affect, challenge and skill were correlated with the teachers 2 ̆ 7 language. Students reported higher levels of challenge and skill (often referred to as 2 ̆ 2 flow experience 2 ̆ 2) during <b>rehearsals</b> with greater use of scaffolding language. Analysis suggests that a strong positive relationship exists between teachers 2 ̆ 7 use of scaffolding language, complete sequential units of instruction, and quality of student experience during middle school choral <b>rehearsals...</b>|$|R
5|$|A brawl scene between Johnson's and Diesel's {{characters}} {{was considered}} difficult to choreograph. The characters were written {{to be equally}} formidable, so the fight was punctuated with moments of character development, as Moritz felt this made the fight more exciting. The scene required several weeks of <b>rehearsal</b> {{and more than a}} week of filming by the actors and their stunt doubles, who incurred several minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|After {{its season}} in London the company {{performed}} in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and Berlin. The tour was successful, artistically and financially, {{but was not}} without untoward incident. A planned visit to St Petersburg had to be cancelled because the Narodny Dom theatre burned down, and in Vienna the Philharmonic was unequal to the difficulties of the score of Petrushka. The illustrious orchestra revolted at the <b>rehearsal</b> for the first performance, refusing to play for Monteux; only an intervention by Diaghilev restored the <b>rehearsal,</b> {{by the end of}} which Monteux was applauded and Stravinsky given an ovation. In the middle of the tour Monteux was briefly summoned back to Paris by the Concerts Colonne, which had the contractual right to recall him, to deputise for Pierné; his own deputy, Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht, took temporary musical charge of the Ballets Russes.|$|E
5|$|After {{making a}} duck against the Marylebone Cricket Club, {{which was a}} dress <b>rehearsal</b> for the Tests as the MCC fielded a virtual England team, Woodfull scored an unbeaten 98 against Cambridge University before running out of partners.
