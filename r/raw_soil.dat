The study was performed using microcosms with defaunated and remolded <b>raw</b> <b>soil</b> that was compressed to bulk densities between 1. 02 – 1. 56 g cm- 3. One of the following species was added to each series: Mesaphorura macrochaeta, Protaphorura armata, and Folsomia fimetaria. The number of individuals and ergosterol concentrations (used to estimate fungal biomass) were measured after each experiment and related to bulk density and pore size distribution. A series of experiments in which straw was added to the soil in order to increase microbial life was also included. Only F. fimetaria was used in the straw amended series. In the <b>raw</b> <b>soil</b> experiments with M. macrochaeta and P. armata the number of individuals was significantly lowered when bulk densities increased from 1. 37 to 1. 47 g cm- 3.

When straw was added, the reproduction of F. fimetaria declined significantly with increasing bulk density from 1. 21 g cm- 3. The decline in collembolan numbers was probably due to the decline in coarse pores (> 120 µm) because there was no correlation between bulk density and ergosterol (food) after 26 days.

A real PCBs {{contaminated}} soil was heated at 500 °C using pure nitrogen as carrier gas under different flow rate {{to investigate the}} influence of carrier gas flow rate on the thermal desorption process. After 1 hour thermal treatment, the residual PCBs in soil decreased and the removal efficiency (RE) of PCBs is up to 95. 1 %. The distributions of PCBs in soil under different flow rate were identical. The World Health Organization toxic equivalency quantity (WHO TEQ) of PCBs in soil got its lowest value at 400 Nml/min. Tetra- and higher chlorinated PCBs desorbed to carrier gas increased with increased flow rate, while {{the total amount of}} PCBs, Tri- and lower chlorinated PCBs first increased then decreased. The distributions of PCBs in carrier gas became more closely to the <b>raw</b> <b>soil</b> with increased flow rate. The TEQ of PCBs in carrier gas increased with increased flow rate. Increased flow rate enhanced the mass transfer of PCBs in the soil but shortened the preheating time of carrier gas and the retention time of carries gas, weakening the mass transfer and degradation process in gas phase. The RE of WHO TEQ of PCDDs in treated soil decreased from 86. 7 % to 83. 2 % with increased flow rate while the RE of WHO TEQ of PCDFs decreased from 85. 4 % to 70. 0 %.

EPN survival was unaffected by treatment (P ≤ 0. 05) in soil that was air-dried to disrupt antagonist activity prior to the experiment. When S. diaprepesi, S. riobrave, Heterorhabditis zealandica or no EPN were added to <b>raw</b> <b>soil</b> and S. diaprepesi was added 5 d later, the survival of both S. diaprepesi and of total EPN was greater (P ≤ 0. 05) in soil that received no pretreatment than in soilpre treated with S. riobrave. Pretreatment of soil with H. zealandica or S. diaprepesi had less or no affect on survival of S. diaprepesi or total EPN. When nematodes were recovered from soil and placed on water agar, the number of S. diaprepesi that were killed by endoparasitic and trapping nematophagous fungi was greater (P ≤ 0. 05) if soil was pretreated with steinernematid species than if the soil was not pretreated or was pretreated with H. zealandica. The adverse effects of pretreating soil on EPN survival were density dependent within a range of pretreatment dosages (20 – 100 IJ/cm 2 soil surface), and the treatment effects required more time to become evident at lower than at higher dosages.

Previous investigations in the canton des Grisons (Switzerland) and Austria have revealed an increase of floristic diversity on alpine summits {{since the beginning of}} the 20 th century. Three summits in Valais were revisited in this study: the Gornergrat (first inventory in 1919), the Torrenthorn (about in 1885) and the Beaufort (about in 1920). Every summit was newly inventoried in 2003 in the framework of the PERMANENT. PLOT. CH project. All showed a strong increase in species richness. On the Gornergrat (3135 m), 16 species were not found anymore, but 35 new ones were observed. The number of species on this exceptionally rich summit rose from 102 to 121. In comparison, the floristic richness increased from 24 to 63 species on the Torrenthorn (2924 m) and from 16 to 48 species on the Beaufort (3048 m). As in previous studies, this increase seems likely to be associated with climate change: the new species prefer, in average, higher temperature conditions than those previously prevailing on the summits.

40|$|For a long time, we {{are facing}} {{problems}} like failures of small and big structures. The biggest problem behind this is swelling soils. This is very unstable soil. Its property varies from hard to soft and dry to wet. It exhibits swelling and shrinkage with different water content. As a result, many structures usually face excessive settlement and differential movements, which causes damage to foundation systems and other structural elements. We are aware about this situation for a long time, but unable to make improvements due to absence of technologies till now. Through physico-chemical modifications, lime can control the plasticity, swelling and shrinkage of soil effectively. Also, lime can stabilize soil through cementation which increases strength and stiffness remarkably. In this work the plasticity characteristics, swell shrinkage properties, compaction characteristics and strength properties of plastic soils with a wide plasticity range treated with lime has been evaluated experimentally. Based on the unconfined compressive strength the optimum lime content of soils has been found out.
