5|$|With the ICU in a <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> the Kenyan border, Transitional Federal Government forces slowly {{advanced}} towards Kismayo {{to avoid}} the many landmines that had been placed. By 1 January 2007, they had reached Kismayo, which was taken without a fight.|$|E
5|$|Before the 18th century, {{the land}} along which Euston Road runs was fields and farmland. Camden Town was a village <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> Londoners {{working in the}} city. Euston Road was {{originally}} part of New Road, promoted by Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton and enabled by an Act of Parliament passed in 1756. Construction began in May that year, and it was open to traffic by September.|$|E
5|$|By 6:30a.m. {{the battle}} for the Alamo was over. Mexican {{soldiers}} inspected each corpse, bayoneting any body that moved. Even with all of the Texians dead, Mexican soldiers continued to shoot, some killing each other in the confusion. Mexican generals were unable to stop the bloodlust and appealed to Santa Anna for help. Although the general showed himself, the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered to sound a <b>retreat.</b> <b>For</b> 15minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies.|$|E

5|$|Having been {{a summer}} <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> the British in India, Darjeeling became {{the place of}} choice for the {{establishment}} of public schools on the model of Eton, Harrow and Rugby, allowing the children of British officials to obtain an exclusive education. Institutions such as St. Robert's H.S. School, St. Paul's School, St. Joseph's School - North Point, Loreto Convent and Mount Hermon School are renowned as centres of educational excellence.|$|E
5|$|The Boca Chita Key {{structures}} are administered {{as a cultural}} landscape, interpreting the area's use as a <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> the rich. More modest homesteads include the now-abandoned plantations developed by Israel Jones and his sons, and the Sweeting Homestead on Elliott Key.

5|$|The Soviet forces {{attempted}} to capture Estonia and its capital Tallinn. Stavka hoped a quick breakthrough at the Emajõgi front would open {{a path for}} the armoured units to the north, thus cutting the Army Detachment Narwa {{off from the rest}} of Army Group North. The Red Army command presumed that the main direction of <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> the German forces would be Tallinn, and concentrated their forces there in an attempt to block the roads.|$|E
5|$|By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, {{which was}} {{by that point}} {{pursuing}} the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack. He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered {{the main body of}} the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to <b>retreat,</b> <b>for</b> doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.|$|E
5|$|Feit did {{not feel}} {{comfortable}} with the monastic lifestyle at Assumption Abbey. He was sent to Jemez Springs, New Mexico, to a treatment <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> troubled priests run by the Servants of the Paraclete. Feit joined the order as a staff member and worked his way into a supervisory role at the center. Father James Porter came to the center after {{he was known to}} have begun molesting children in the 1960s, and Feit cleared him for placement in another parish. Porter was later defrocked and imprisoned after abusing as many as 100 children. Feit left the priesthood in the 1970s. He got married, moved to the Phoenix area, and had three children. He worked at the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul as a food charity volunteer for 17 years.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s and 1970s {{the program}} of {{activities}} at the centre was expanded. The centre moved away from traditional weekend <b>retreats</b> <b>for</b> parish groups. More activity was focussed on married couples, and evening sessions were introduced. In the 1970s Alcoholics Anonymous groups started at the centre. In 1995, six- and eight-day <b>retreats</b> <b>for</b> smaller groups with personal spiritual directors were started. In 2001, more ecumenical projects were launched.|$|R

5|$|General Lee {{responded to}} the British landing with several actions. He began {{reinforcing}} positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at {{the northern end of}} Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 Henry Morrison Flagler {{brought the}} Florida East Coast Railway to Miami. Mary Ann and William Davis {{had dreamed of}} {{building}} a city on Key Biscayne. Now their son Waters was a retired millionaire, and interested only in preserving Key Biscayne as a quiet <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> his family. For a while Flagler's arrival did disturb their quiet, as Flagler brought in dredges to deepen the Cape Florida Channel and the approaches {{to the mouth of}} the Miami River, muddying the formerly clear waters of Biscayne Bay. Soon, however, a shorter route from the ocean to Miami was dredged through the southern end of what is now Miami Beach, at Government Cut, and the Cape Florida Channel was allowed to return to a natural state.|$|E
5|$|NY240 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY242 {{in the town}} of Ellicottville along the western leg of a railroad wye near Beaver Meadows Creek. NY240 proceeds northward alongside Beaver Meadows Creek co-designated as County Route32 (CR32; West Valley Road). The routes proceed northward through Ellicottville as a two-lane roadway through dense forestry, bending northward along the creek and a nearby railroad track. The dense forestry remains for several miles, before bending northeast into an intersection with Fancy Tract Road. NY240 and CR32 continue northeast as the dense woods <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> residences before bending northwest away from Beaver Meadows Creek. After bending northward once more, the routes cross through large fields and past several houses along West Valley Road.|$|E

5|$|Ranchers grazed {{thousands}} of cattle {{on public land}} that would later {{become part of the}} park, and homesteaders farmed and ranched {{at the base of the}} Rincons, filing homestead applications from the 1890s through 1930. The remains of the former Freeman Homestead, established in 1929, lies along a nature trail in the RMD. The homestead is on the Arizona State Register of Historic Places. Manning Cabin, built in 1905 as a summer <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> Levi Manning, a wealthy businessman and one-term mayor of Tucson, is part of the infrastructure at Manning Camp near Mica Mountain. Modified and restored after falling into disrepair, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Cultural resources in the park include more than 450 archeological sites and more than 60 historic structures.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneous {{with the}} battle at Thermopylae, an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians. Directly before Artemisium, the Persian fleet {{had been caught}} in a gale {{off the coast of}} Magnesia, losing many ships, but could still {{probably}} muster over 800 ships {{at the start of the}} battle. On the first day (also the first of the Battle of Thermopylae), the Persians detached 200 seaworthy ships, which were sent to sail around the eastern coast of Euboea. These ships were to round Euboea and block the line of <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> the Allied fleet. Meanwhile, the Allies and the remaining Persians engaged in the late afternoon, the Allies having the better of the engagement and capturing 30 vessels. That evening, another storm occurred, wrecking the majority of the Persian detachment which had been sent around Euboea.|$|E
5|$|While the Ottoman Fourth Army {{continued}} to hold {{the eastern side of}} the Jordan Valley, Es Salt, Amman and the Hejaz railway, Chaytor's smaller force was to continue the EEF's occupation of the Jordan Valley. As soon as possible, Chaytor's Force was to advance northwards to capture the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, which would cut a main line of <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies. This was also a main line of communication between the two armies west of the Jordan River in the Judean Hills with the Fourth Army in the east. The expectation was that, the attacks on the Eighth Army by the XXI and Desert Mounted Corps, and the start of the Battle of Nablus attacks on the Seventh Army, would force the Fourth Army to withdraw northwards along the Hejaz railway to conform with the withdrawals of the Seventh and Eighth Armies.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, naval operations were mainly focused along the south-east and southern coasts. The defences of Pendennis were reinforced, while Southsea, with the addition of anti-Zeppelin guns, formed part of the Fortress Portsmouth plan for defending the Solent. Calshot formed a base for anti-submarine warfare, and the remaining castles of the Downs were used to support the activities of the Dover Patrol. St Mawes and Portland were used as barracks, and Walmer became a weekend <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> the Prime Minister, Asquith, exploiting its good communication links with the front line in France.|$|E
5|$|During {{a period}} of ill health, Susan hits Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon) with her car after passing out. Susan is unaware that she has struck Bridget and she leaves the scene. When she realises that she is responsible, Susan confesses and it causes a bitter feud between the Kennedys and the Parkers. However, during Susan's trial, Bridget remembers falling {{into the path of}} the car and that the {{collision}} was unavoidable. Soon afterwards, following a series of incorrect diagnoses, Susan is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Susan is shocked and scared, and Karl and Libby try to help her. Susan collapses at Toadie and Steph's wedding rehearsal and she goes to a multiple sclerosis <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> professional help. Susan takes sick leave from the school and becomes a journalist for the Erinsborough News. After Libby is told she cannot have any more children, she and Dan decide to try surrogacy. Susan offers to be their surrogate, despite Karl's objections. Paul Robinson finds out about the surrogacy and writes a newspaper article about it, without knowing the identity of the family involved. When he finds out that Susan is the surrogate, he makes it public. The family face abuse and the hospital board decide to end the programme.|$|E
5|$|The first {{alternative}} was to march southeast to the River Kennet and cross it, going through Newbury {{and returning to}} Reading's fortifications, thus evading the Royalists and allowing for a safe retreat to London. The disadvantage to {{this was the time}} it would take to cross the relatively open land between Essex's position and the Kennet. The second, and the option Essex initially took, was to go north, either to make battle in more advantageous circumstances or to evade the Royalists. If Essex was able to cross to {{the west bank of the}} River Avon, he could secure the bridges across it and prevent the Royalists from crossing it and confronting his army. His cavalry advanced to Upton to screen the main force from Royalist interference on 11 September, with the rest of the soldiers quickly following. The Royalists were left wrong-footed; Charles did not discover Essex's <b>retreat</b> <b>for</b> another 24 hours, during which the gap between the armies widened. The Royalists finally began to march on 16 September, with Rupert's cavalry streaming ahead to try to disrupt the Parliamentarian retreat.|$|E
