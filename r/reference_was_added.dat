40|$|We {{construct}} an explicit solution of type-IIB supergravity describing the strong coupling regime of a non-supersymmetric gauge theory.

The running coupling has a power law behaviour, argued to be universal, {{that is consistent with}} holography. Around the critical point, our solution defines an asymptotic expansion for the gauge coupling beta-function. We also calculate the first correction to the Coulombic quark-antiquark potential.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} of black holes that are solutions of the dilaton gravity derived from string-theoretical models in two and five dimensions against to scalar field perturbations, using the Quasinormal Modes (QNMs) approach. In order to find the QNMs corresponding to a black hole geometry, we consider perturbations described by a massive scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity. We find that the QNM's frequencies {{turn out to be}} pure imaginary leading to purely damped modes, that is in agreement with the literature of dilatonic black holes. Our result exhibits the unstable behavior of the considered geometry against the scalar perturbations. We consider both the minimal coupling case, i. e., for which the coupling parameter ζ vanishes, and the case ζ= 1 / 4.

40|$|By using {{a second}} {{quantized}} formulation of level crossing, {{which does not}} assume adiabatic approximation, a convenient formula for geometric terms including off-diagonal terms is derived. The analysis of geometric phases is reduced to a simple diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the present formulation. If one diagonalizes the geometric terms in the infinitesimal neighborhood of level crossing, the geometric phases become trivial for any finite time interval $T$. The topological interpretation of Berry's phase such as the topological proof of phase-change rule thus fails in the practical Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where a large but finite ratio of two time scales is involved.

40|$|In the {{standard}} model of the elementary particles, the number of neutrino flavor is three. However, there have been indications of existence of 4 th neutrino, called sterile neutrino, in some neutrino oscillation related experiments. A number of experiments are planned to test whether such indications are true or not. Among them, experiments which use neutrinos from pi+, K+, mu+ decay at rest (DAR) are promising because the energy spectra of neutrinos are very well known and clean oscillation measurements are possible. In this proceedings, properties of such DAR neutrinos and LSND, JSNS 2, OscSNS and KPipe experiments are briefly introduced.

40|$|We {{study the}} system of massive and mixed neutrinos {{interacting}} with background matter moving with an acceleration. We start with the derivation of the Dirac equation for a single neutrino in the noninertial frame where matter is at rest. A particular case of matter rotating with a constant angular velocity is considered. The Dirac equation is solved and the neutrino energy levels are found for ultrarelativistic particles propagating in rotating matter. Then we generalize our results to include several neutrino generations and consider mixing between them. Using the relativistic quantum mechanics approach we derive the effective Schrödinger equation for the description of neutrino flavor oscillations in rotating matter. We obtain the resonance condition for neutrino oscillations and examine {{how it can be}} affected by the matter rotation. We also compare our results with the findings of other authors who studied analogous problem previously.

In the mass range 6. 3 - 9. 0 GeV/c^ 2, we derive 90 % upper credible limits to the ratio of the production cross section times muonic branching fraction of possible narrow resonances to that of the Y(1 S) meson. In this mass range, the average limit varies from 1. 7 to 0. 5 %. This limit is much worse at the mass of 7. 2 GeV/c^ 2 due to an excess of 250 +- 61 events with a width consistent with the detector resolution. Comment: 20 pages, 9 figures.
