25|$|The organ at {{the church}} was {{presented}} as a gift by Ernest Hargreaves in 1889 and was built by Alfred Monk of Camden in 1880. It has 35 speaking stops on three manuals and pedal including principal stops, <b>reed</b> <b>stops,</b> flute stops, string stops and a 32ft contrabass stop. The organ went through major restoration in 1975; carried out by Hill, Norman and Beard.|$|E
25|$|In 1931 {{the organ}} was reconstructed by Henry WillisIII {{when the number}} of stops was {{increased}} to 120 and electro-pneumatic action introduced for the combination systems and some of the key action. Its power source was still the Rockingham electric blowing plant which had replaced the two steam engines (one of 1855 and a second which had been added in about 1877 to run the increased pressure required since 1867 for some <b>reed</b> <b>stops.</b> In the interim this higher pressure had been hand blown!) The 1924 electric blowers remained in use until 2000 when the present new low and high pressure blowers were fitted by David Wells.|$|E
500|$|The organ was {{installed}} in the Great Hall in the late 17thcentury. [...] There is some dispute in respect of the precise date of installation and the builder. [...] It was probably built in about 1670, and {{has been attributed to}} Bernard [...] "Father" [...] Smith, but [...] "no conclusive evidence has come to light either to substantiate or to dismiss this theory". It has two manuals, no pedals, and fourteen speaking stops. [...] It includes three 17th-century <b>reed</b> <b>stops,</b> which is a rarity for the time. [...] The organ was [...] "remade" [...] in about 1680 by Christian Smith, and rebuilt in 1741–42 by Glyn and Parker. [...] In 1958–59 it was restored by Noel Mander, at which time it had been derelict for a century or more. [...] The organ has a [...] "very fine Renaissance case", in two tiers. [...] In the lower tier are the two manual keyboards over which is a row of pipes. [...] The upper tier consists of five panels containing pipes, which are flanked by Corinthian pilasters. [...] Over the top is a large curved hood containing gilded statues of putti playing trumpets, and a coat of arms celebrating the marriage of John Legh to Isabella Robartes in 1693. [...] The hall's website states it is [...] "without doubt England's most important surviving instrument from the late 17thcentury". [...] It has been awarded a Historic Organ Certificate. The organ was filmed and recorded for the documentary The Elusive English Organ.|$|E

2500|$|Cavaillé-Coll is {{responsible}} for many innovations that revolutionized organ building, performance and composition. Instead of the Positif, Cavaillé-Coll placed the Grand-Chœur manual as the lowest manual, and included couplers that allowed the entire tonal resources of the organ to be played from the Grand-Chœur. He refined the English swell box by devising a spring-loaded (later balanced) pedal with which the organist could operate the swell shutters, thus increasing the organ's potential for expression. He adjusted pipemaking and voicing techniques, thus creating a whole family of stops imitating orchestral instruments such as the bassoon, the oboe and the english horn. He popularized the harmonic flute stop, which, together with the montre, the gambe and the bourdon, formed the fonds (foundations) of the organ. He introduced divided windchests which were controlled by ventils. [...] These allowed the use of higher wind pressures and for each manual's anches (<b>reed</b> <b>stops)</b> to be added or subtracted as a group {{by means of a}} pedal. Higher wind pressures allowed the organ to include many more stops of 8' (unison) pitch in every division, so complete fonds as well as reed choruses could be placed in every division, designed to be superimposed on top of one another. Sometimes he placed the treble part of the compass on a higher pressure than the bass, to emphasize melody lines and counteract the natural tendency of small pipes (especially reeds) to be softer.|$|E

5000|$|In England and France, {{the word}} [...] "regal" [...] was {{sometimes}} applied to <b>reed</b> <b>stops</b> on the organ; Mersenne (1636) {{states that the}} word was applied {{at that time to}} the vox humana stop. According to Praetorius, the <b>reed</b> <b>stops</b> of pipe organs required constant tuning; he emphasized the fact that the pitch of the stop fell in summer and rose in winter. The pitch of the other stops rose in summer and fell in winter.|$|E
50|$|The organ {{possesses}} a unique {{stop in the}} organ world, the 64-foot Diaphone-Dulzian in the Right Stage chamber (Pedal Right division), {{one of only two}} true 64-foot stops in the world. (The other 64-foot stop is the Contra-Trombone <b>reed</b> <b>stop</b> in the Sydney Town Hall Grand Organ.) The stop is unique, because it is a reed/diaphone hybrid.|$|R

50|$|Cavaillé-Coll {{retained}} {{the case and}} most of the stops. He migrated the Great <b>reeds</b> <b>stops</b> into a new Bombarde keyboard and created an enclosed-Swell at the center top of the case. He added several other stops to a total of 65, including an identical replacement of the two 16’ and 32’ Vautrin’s Bombardes, reconstructed the wind system, the tracker action and the entire console.|$|R
50|$|The organ has 7,952 pipes, with ca 900 {{classified}} as historical. It has 110 real stops, five 56-key manuals and a 32-key pedalboard. In December 1992, a two-year {{restoration of the}} organ was completed that fully computerized the organ under three LANs (Local Area Networks). The restoration also included a number of additions, notably two further horizontal <b>reed</b> <b>stops</b> en chamade in the Cavaille-Coll style. The Notre-Dame organ is therefore unique in France in having five fully independent <b>reed</b> <b>stops</b> en chamade.|$|E

50|$|The organ in the NCH was {{installed}} by the organ builders Kenneth Jones and Associates in 1991, {{ten years after}} the auditorium was built. It features prominently in various performances at the NCH. It {{is one of the largest}} organs in Ireland with 4 manuals and 50 stops. One of the notable features of the organ is the magnificent State Trumpet, a horizontal <b>reed</b> <b>stop</b> that faces out into the auditorium.|$|R

50|$|The regal {{was a small}} {{portable}} organ, {{furnished with}} beating reeds and having two bellows. The instrument enjoyed its greatest popularity during the Renaissance. The name was also sometimes given to the <b>reed</b> <b>stops</b> of a pipe organ, and more especially the vox humana stop.|$|E
50|$|Some {{characteristics}} of this organ remain unique and reflect Cavaillé-Coll’s genius : his specification retains {{most of the}} former <b>reed</b> <b>stops.</b> He also added reeds of his own design, making an exceptional total of 23 reeds stops, being 1/3 of the entire organ. Such a proportion remained unique among all his work.|$|E
5000|$|En chamade (French: [...] "to sound a parley") {{refers to}} powerfully voiced <b>reed</b> <b>stops</b> in a pipe organ {{that have been}} mounted horizontally, rather than vertically, {{in the front of}} the organ case, {{projecting}} out into the church or concert hall. [...] They produce a commanding, loud trumpet-like tone, used for fanfares and solos. It is known as Fan Trumpet, Horizontal Trumpet, and Trompette en Chamade.|$|E

5000|$|A less-common type of reed {{construction}} is the free reed. The term refers to {{two types of}} reeds where the tongue does not beat directly against the shallot {{in order to produce}} the reed tone, which creates a unique sound (these are most commonly used on nineteenth-century German or French organs). In one case, the free <b>reed</b> <b>stop</b> will appear from the outside like a normal reed (complete with boot, tuning wire, and resonator, etc.). The only difference lies in the action of the tongue (see above), which beats [...] "through" [...] the shallot (hence the German term for the reed — durchschlagend). In the other form of the reed, an enclosed boot does not exist (as in normal reed pipes); therefore, all the tongues are held together in the same chamber, as in the harmonica, accordion, or harmonium. This arrangement makes it possible to change the volume produced without changing its pitch by varying the wind pressure, which is not possible with normal organ pipes. Volume adjustment was available to the organist by means of a balanced expression pedal which varied the wind pressure delivered to the free <b>reed</b> <b>stop.</b> This type of free reed was popular among certain organ builders of the nineteenth century due to the increased interest in a more expressive aesthetic.|$|R
50|$|When {{construction}} of the organ commenced, it was planned to have two 64-foot stops in the pedal, a Diaphone Profunda and a Dulzian. Later, the design was revised, and the Diaphone was cut, because it was feared it would crowd the Right Stage chamber (due to {{the width of the}} pipes). Consequently, the Dulzian was moved to the Right Stage chamber. However, the sound of the 64-foot Dulzian did not meet the criteria, requiring Diaphone pipes to be used for the lowest 22 notes. The remaining pipes in the rank are reeds. Because of the low frequencies involved, and because the diaphone is voiced to imitate a <b>reed</b> <b>stop,</b> the transition from reed to diaphone cannot be heard.|$|R
50|$|In February of 2017 Organ Tuner Jean-François Mailhot of Sydney Mines {{spent a week}} {{refurbishing}} Opus 1841, revoicing the <b>reed</b> <b>stops</b> (cleaning {{the reed}} tongues and shallots) of the swell organ: the 8' Trompette, the 8' Oboe, and the 4' Clarion, {{as well as the}} 16' Trombone of the Pedal Organ. At this time he also repaired a damaged facade pipe, part of the 8' Open Diapason stop of the Great Organ.|$|E
50|$|New {{ranks of}} pipes {{have been added}} over the years include the Great Mixture, {{mutations}} in the Swell, the <b>reed</b> <b>stops</b> (Trumpet 8' and Clarion 4') and the Subbass 16' in the Pedal. The organ continues to be integral with {{the music of the}} church, and is played at the Sunday morning services. Mr Robert Navaratnam, Singapore 's only organ builder, has been responsible for the renovations and regular maintenance and tuning of the organ.|$|E
50|$|Several organ {{mechanisms}} were cultivated {{more in the}} Iberian peninsula {{than anywhere}} else. For example, these organs frequently incorporated a device known as meio-registo ("half-stop"), which, when activated, divided the keyboard into two distinct parts with sharp contrasts in timbre, giving the effect of two manuals instead of one. Another conspicuous feature in both Portugal and Spain was the horizontal placing (em chamada, the Portuguese called it) of particularly powerful, strident <b>reed</b> <b>stops,</b> very useful for imitating trumpet fanfares.|$|E
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 17th century, organ designers began to give pedalboards on large organs a larger range, encompassing twenty-eight to thirty notes. As well, German organ designers began to use longer, narrower pedals, with a wider space between the pedals. By this point, most pedals were given a smoother lever-action by including a fulcrum at the back of each pedal. These design changes allowed performers to play more complex, fast-moving pedal lines. This gave rise to the dramatic pedal solos found in German organ works from composers from the Lutheran Organ School, such as J.S. Bach. In Bach's organ music the cantus firmus melody, which is usually a hymn tune, is often performed in the pedal, using a <b>reed</b> <b>stop</b> to make it stand out.|$|R
50|$|Recent work (2012) has {{occurred}} in the organ, led by organ builders Laurent Plet and Bertrand Cattiaux; it consisted of dust removal, mechanics and wind review, re-voicing of the Choir and restoration of its <b>reeds</b> <b>stops.</b> If today’s organ specification slightly more reflects the néo-classique aesthetics because of the 1965 Hærpfer-Erman’s modifications, the organ’s sound still keeps a deep influence from Cavaillé-Coll. It still remains 24 stops (37% of total) from Dupont, 23 (35%) from Cavaillé-Coll and 2 from Vautrin. Sixteen stops have been replaced, but recently several flutes stops have been made harmonic again and the Choir’s reeds have been re-voiced (2012). The Pedal and the extraordinary Swell have been kept nearly unmodified since 1965 and contribute to a still indisputable symphonic sound.|$|R
5000|$|Often, {{an organ}} will feature two similarly-voiced stops, one tuned {{slightly}} sharp or flat of the other. When these stops are played together, a unique undulating effect results due to alternating constructive and destructive interference (beat frequency). Examples include the Voix céleste (French for celestial voice), typically tuned slightly sharp, and the Unda maris (Latin for sea waves), typically tuned slightly flat. String stops are {{most commonly used}} as undulating stops, though some builders have made undulating flute stops (notably Ernest M. Skinner's Flute celeste), and rarely an organ may feature an undulating diapason, as in the Italian [...] "Voce Umana" [...] (not {{to be confused with}} the Vox Humana, which is a soft <b>reed</b> <b>stop</b> with a short resonator).|$|R
5000|$|Dialogue: a piece which {{constantly}} alternates {{between two}} different registrations. Nivers distinguished between two subtypes: Dialogue de récits and Dialogue à deux Chœurs, the latter alternating between positif (choir organ) and grand jeu (full <b>reed</b> <b>stops).</b> Also encountered are dialogues that use more chœurs than two; a Dialogue à 4 Chœurs will alternate between positif, grand jeu, récit sections and the pedal, {{and may also}} include echo sections (as in a Dialogue à 4 Chœurs by Jacques Boyvin).|$|E
50|$|The organ has 7,374 pipes, with ca 900 {{classified}} as historical. It has 110 real stops, five 56-key manuals and a 32-key pedalboard. In December 1992, a two-year {{restoration of the}} organ was completed that fully computerized the organ under three LANs (Local Area Networks). The restoration also included a number of additions, notably two further horizontal <b>reed</b> <b>stops</b> en chamade in the Cavaille-Coll style. The Notre-Dame organ is therefore unique in France in having five fully independent <b>reed</b> <b>stops</b> en chamade. The church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais {{is one of the}} great shrines of organ music, thanks to the Couperin family; eight members of the family were organists there from 1656 until 1826. They included Louis Couperin (1626-1661), and François Couperin (1668-1733) authors of celebrated masses and other compositions for the instrument. The grand organ of Couperin is still in place on the Tribune above the entrance at the back of the church. The first organ was constructed by Mathis Languhedul of Flanders in 1601; followed by new organ made by the French dynasty of Pierre, Alexandre and François Thierry, between 1649 and 1714; then rebuilt by François-Henri Cliquot in 1769, with many restorations over the following years. The organ itself is a registered historic landmark.|$|E
50|$|On {{classical}} French organs, the plein jeu is a principal-based plenum registration. It {{includes the}} Montres, Bourdons, Prestants and Doublettes (Principals 16', 8', 4' and 2') and the Fournitures and Cymbales (lower- and higher-pitched mixtures). The classical French organ {{also allows for}} a reed-based registration; the grand jeu, which used a loud combination of <b>reed</b> <b>stops</b> (usually consist of trompette 8′, Clarion 4′, Prestant 4′ and Cornet séparé (or Cornet V), which comprises Bourdon 8′, 4′, 2′, Nasard 2′, Tierce 1′.) in homophonic sections of larger pieces or standalone préludes.|$|E

50|$|Positive organs {{typically}} exhibit few stops due {{to their}} small size and portable nature; a specification of 8&prime; stopped, 4&prime; flute and 2&prime; principal (diapason) is common. Somewhat larger positives may also have a 2-2/3&prime; and/or other mutation stop and/or a small mixture, and some have an 8&prime; <b>reed</b> <b>stop</b> (such as a regal). Still larger positives may have a 4&prime; principal or a second 8&prime; stop, the latter often treble-only. More complex examples feature a divided keyboard, which allows each stop to be activated separately in the treble and bass portions of the keyboard. This {{makes it possible to}} play a melody and an accompaniment simultaneously on different registrations. Most positives have just one manual keyboard and no pedals, but there are examples with a set of pedal pulldowns or even a pedal stop or two, as well as rarer ones with two manuals.|$|R
5000|$|The Vox humana (Latin for [...] "human voice;" [...] also [...] "voz humana" [...] in Spanish and Portuguese, [...] "voix humaine" [...] in French and [...] "voce umana" [...] in Italian, {{although}} [...] "voce umana" [...] {{is also a}} {{term for}} a celeste stop, q.v.) is a short-resonator <b>reed</b> <b>stop</b> on the pipe organ, so named because of its supposed resemblance to the human voice. As a rule, the stop is used with a tremulant, which undulates the wind supply, causing a vibrato effect. The vox humana is intended to evoke {{the impression of a}} singing choir or soloist, though the success of this intent depends as much upon the acoustics of the room in which the organ speaks as it does the voicing of the pipes. It is almost invariably at 8&prime; pitch, though on theater organs {{it is not uncommon to}} encounter a chorus of vox humana stops at 8&prime; and 4&prime; pitch, with the addition of a 16&prime; acting as a pedal stop.|$|R
