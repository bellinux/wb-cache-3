5|$|Those {{lyrics are}} crazy. I {{listen to that}} like, 'What was she doing?' Pharrell's just so creative, I <b>remember</b> <b>back</b> then, and he's always kind of been the same. He's always so {{positive}} and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E
500|$|His 1985 film Revolution about a fur trapper {{during the}} American Revolutionary War, was a {{commercial}} and critical failure, which Pacino blamed on a rushed production, {{resulting in a}} four-year hiatus from films. At this time Pacino returned to the stage. He mounted workshop productions of Crystal Clear, National Anthems and other plays; he appeared in Julius Caesar in 1988 in producer Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival. Pacino remarked on his hiatus from film: [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>back</b> when everything was happening, '74, '75, doing The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui on stage and reading that the reason I'd {{gone back to the}} stage was that my movie career was waning! That's been the kind of ethos, the way in which theater's perceived, unfortunately." [...] Pacino returned to film in 1989's Sea of Love, when he portrayed a detective hunting a serial killer who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper. The film earned solid reviews.|$|E
2500|$|I {{think we}} were fairly smart with [...] "Spoonman" [...] in that you really don't see us that much in the video. You see various {{pictures}} of us, but it's {{not quite the same}} as having us in your living room all the time. We're trying to maintain some degree of mystique about Soundgarden, I guess. I <b>remember</b> <b>back</b> when I was a kid, long before MTV, {{and the only way to}} see my favorite bands was to go to their concerts. It was an incredible experience. MTV has helped a lot of bands, but they've also helped rob a lot of groups of that special mystique. It's tough when you can see a great rock band on TV one second, then hit the clicker and be watching a soap opera or a sitcom the next. That's what rock and roll has become for some people.|$|E

2500|$|Trouble {{was formed}} in 1979 by Rick Wartell and was joined by guitarist Bruce Franklin, vocalist Eric Wagner, bassist Tim Ian Brown (not to be {{confused}} with lead singer of English band The Stone Roses), and drummer Jeff Olson. Ian Brown was replaced by Sean McAllister in 1983. Drawing from Black Sabbath for inspiration (with occasional nods to the psychedelic sounds of the late 1960s), the band used gloomy down-tuned riffs and spiritual, often openly Bible-inspired lyrics, which led Metal Blade to market the band as [...] "white metal" [...] as opposed to black metal. [...] "I was brought up Catholic", vocalist and primary lyric writer Wagner explains in the liner notes of Psalm 9 re-issue (2006), [...] "but you have to <b>remember,</b> <b>back</b> in the early 1980s, all the metal was kind of satanic, and I did not get into that vibe." [...] Wagner has implied that Metal Blade actually came up with the term in the first place, which the band rejected: [...] "I think it was more like Metal Blade trying to be cute or something, with everything [...] being called black metal, why not call us white metal, which is a bunch of crap." ...|$|E

But it made the captain <b>remember</b> <b>back</b> across the years to his own girl babe asleep on his arm. And so poignantly did he remember, that he became wide awake, and many pictures, beginning, with the girl babe, burned their torment in his brain. No white man in the Solomons knew what he carried about with him, waking and often sleeping; and it was because of these pictures that he had come to the Solomons in a vain effort to erase them.|$|E

60|$|I {{suppose that}} many, {{many years ago}} I {{gathered}} {{the idea that the}} Taj's place in the achievements of man was exactly the place of the ice-storm in the achievements of Nature; that the Taj represented man's supremest possibility in the creation of grace and beauty and exquisiteness and splendor, just as the ice-storm represents Nature's supremest possibility in the combination of those same qualities. I do not know how long ago that idea was bred in me, but I know that I cannot <b>remember</b> <b>back</b> to a time when the thought of either of these symbols of gracious and unapproachable perfection did not at once suggest the other. If I thought of the ice-storm, the Taj rose before me divinely beautiful; if I thought of the Taj, with its encrustings and inlayings of jewels, the vision of the ice-storm rose. And so, to me, all these years, the Taj has had no rival among the temples and palaces of men, none that even remotely approached it--it was man's architectural ice-storm.|$|E
60|$|She said that, many ages ago, {{there had}} been a wild sachem in the forest, a king among the Indians, and from whom, the old lady said, with a look of pride, she and Septimius were {{lineally}} descended, and were probably the very last who inherited one drop of that royal, wise, and warlike blood. The sachem had lived very long, longer than anybody knew, for the Indians kept no record, and could only talk of a great number of moons; and they said he was as old, or older, than the oldest trees; as old as the hills almost, and could <b>remember</b> <b>back</b> to the days of godlike men, who had arts then forgotten. He was a wise and good man, and could foretell as far into the future as he could remember into the past; and he continued to live on, till his people were afraid that he would live forever, and so disturb the whole order of nature; and they thought it time that so good a man, and so great a warrior and wizard, should be gone to the happy hunting-grounds, and that so wise a counsellor should go and tell his experience of life to the Great Father, and give him an account of matters here, and perhaps lead him to make some changes in the conduct of the lower world. And so, all these things duly considered, they very reverently assassinated the great, never-dying sachem; for though safe against disease, and undecayable by age, he was capable of being killed by violence, though the hardness of his skull broke to fragments the stone tomahawk with which they at first tried to kill him.|$|E
