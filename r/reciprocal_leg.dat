40|$|It is {{anticipated}} that legged locomotive robotic vehicles {{will provide the}} abilities for traveling across vast terrains, for varieties of tasks, such as mining, foresting, and agriculture. One noticeable concern of such systems is the generation of motion pattern. In our study, we accomplished human walking motion in 2 D, using a biped model with simple bar-like legs, and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>leg</b> stretch-contraction motion. Although extremely simple, this model possesses common characteristics to that of human biped walking, such as normal step length, duty factor, and reaction force patterns. We found that, by using additional stretchcontraction mechanisms to the knees, the same kicking and sinking motion can generate slopeclimbing motions {{similar to that of}} walking on level ground. ...|$|E
