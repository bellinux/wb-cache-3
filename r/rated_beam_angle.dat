40|$|SummaryAimDependence of diode {{dosimeters}} on {{variation of}} temperature, distance, dose <b>rate</b> and incident <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> for MDR/LDR intracavitary brachytherapy was investigated. Materials/MethodsFlexible probes from PTW/Germany were irradiated using Cs- 137 sources. The rectum probe (type 9112) had five semiconductors and the bladder probe had one. Firstly, detectors' dependence on temperature was studied. The probes were immersed into a water tank {{and the temperature}} was slowly increased. To investigate the angular dependence of the diodes, the sources were placed at 5 cm distance from diodes at four different angles. Probes were placed at 3 cm distance from {{the centre of the}} source arrays and the responses for three different dose rates were evaluated. To assess the dependency of responses on distance, probes were placed at three different distances with constant dose rate. ResultsA slight linear increase of the diode signal with temperature was found. The diodes exhibited a variation in sensitivity with dose rate less than 0. 15 % and with distance less than 0. 04 % per mm. A linear decrease of the diode responses was also observed with increase of the radiation <b>beam</b> <b>angle.</b> ConclusionsThe current study showed that there is no significant variation in the response of diodes with temperature, dose rate and distance for MDR brachytherapy. However, the increase of radiation <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> led to a significant decrease of diode response. In conclusion, the observed temperature, dose rate and distance effects are negligible but the diode correction factor {{as a function of the}} incidence <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> must be applied to these diodes...|$|R
40|$|There {{is active}} {{interest}} in {{the extent to which}} unresolved gamma-ray pulsars contribute to the galactic diffuse emission, and whether unresolved gamma-ray pulsars could be responsible for the excess of diffuse galactic emission above 1 GeV which has been observed by EGRET. The diffuse gamma-ray intensity due to unresolved pulsars is directly linked to the number of objects which should be observed in the EGRET data. We can therefore use our knowledge of the unidentified EGRET sources to constrain model parameters like the pulsar birth <b>rate,</b> their <b>beaming</b> <b>angle,</b> etc. This analysis is based only on the properties of the six pulsars which have been identified in the EGRET data, and is independent of choice of a pulsar emission model. We find that pulsars contribute very little to the diffuse emission at lower energies, whereas above 1 GeV they can account for 18 % of the observed intensity in selected regions for a reasonable number of directly observable gamma-ray pulsars (14). The latitude distribution of the diffuse emission caused by unresolved pulsars is narrower than that of the observed diffuse emission. While the excess above 1 GeV gamma-ray energy is observed up to at least 6 - 8 degrees off the plane, the pulsar contribution would be small there. Thus pulsars do significantly contribute to the diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission above 1 GeV, but they can not be made responsible for all the discrepancy between observed intensity and model predictions in this energy range.

40|$|The {{selection}} of suitable <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> in external <b>beam</b> radiotherapy is at present generally {{based upon the}} experience of the human planner. The requirement to automatically select <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> is particularly highlighted in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), in which a smaller number of modulated beams is hoped to be used, in comparison with conformal radiotherapy.

40|$|The Io-Jupiter {{interaction}} generates strong decametric radio emissions (DAM), {{which appear}} as arcs in the time-frequency plane. These emissions are <b>beamed</b> at an <b>angle</b> from {{the magnetic field}} lines, which may vary with frequency and longitude amongst other properties. Empirical models of this <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> describe {{the shape of the}} DAM arcs and offer insight into the emission mechanism for DAM. Several studies have investigated the variation in the emission <b>beaming</b> <b>angle.</b> The studies span a range of frequencies which depend on the observational means (spacecraft, ground-based radio telescopes) used to obtain data. Subsequently, because of the varying assumptions made (e. g. relativistic vs. non-relativistic electrons for the wave polarization), methods used (e. g. prescribing a <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function vs. determining a <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function from observational geometry) and frequency ranges observed, different results have been found in each study. In the present paper, we model the shape of the emission with an empirical <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function and adjust the parameters to best fit the emission arcs. However, our model builds on previous models by taking into account the location of Io in the Jovian magnetic field. We also look at a broader frequency range than many of the intermediate studies. We find that a simple empirical <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function describes the shape of the A, B, and D arcs and that the <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function must decrease at high and low frequencies. We then propose a simple explanation for the <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> profile, deduced from cyclotron maser theory. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R
40|$|Equispaced beam {{arrangements}} are typically used for IMRT plans. This beam arrangement provides adequate dose coverage {{to the target}} while sparing dose to other structures. However, an equispaced beam arrangement may not provide the best dose coverage to the target while sparing dose to the other structures. <b>Beam</b> <b>angle</b> optimization attempts to optimize the beam directions to produce a better IMRT plan; this is achieved by increasing dose to the target while minimizing dose to the remaining structures. Most methods of <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> optimization attempt to optimize the <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and the <b>beam</b> intensity profiles to find an optimal set of <b>beam</b> <b>angles.</b> This thesis attempts to optimize the <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> without determining the beam intensity profiles. An MCNP simulation is run to score the beam directions; the simulation is run as an adjoint problem to reduce simulation time, with the target as the source and the detectors scoring the dose for the gantry <b>angles</b> of the <b>beam.</b> Then, an optimization algorithm is run to select a set of <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> for an optimized IMRT plan. The optimized IMRT plan is compared to an equispaced IMRT plan on a commercial treatment planning system to determine if this method of <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> optimization is better than using an equispaced beam arrangement. The results of this thesis indicate that the coupling of an MCNP simulation for scoring with an optimization algorithm to select <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> will produce a better IMRT plan than an equispaced IMRT plan. Three different geometries were used and for all geometries, the optimized IMRT plan had a higher average dose to the target while maintaining or increasing dose sparing to the critical structure and normal tissue.

40|$|The mmWave {{communication}} system is operating at a regime with {{high number of}} antennas and very limited number of RF analog chains. Large number of antennas are used to extend the communication range for recovering the high path loss while fewer RF analog chains are designed to reduce transmit and processing power and hardware complexity. In this regime, typical MIMO algorithms are not applicable. Before any communication starts, devices are needed to align their <b>beam</b> pointing <b>angles</b> towards each other. An efficient searching protocol to obtain the best <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> pair is therefore needed. It is called BeamForming (BF) training protocol. This paper presents a new BF training technique called beam coding. Each <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> is assigned unique signature code. By coding multiple <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and steering at their angles simultaneously in a training packet, the best <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> pair can be obtained in a few packets.

Materials and Methods: Three patients with localized prostate cancer retrospectively selected from our institution were studied. For each patient, IMPT plans were designed using two, three and four <b>beam</b> <b>angles,</b> respectively, obtained from a <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> optimization algorithm. Those plans were then compared with ones using two lateral parallel-opposed beams according to the conventional planning protocol for localized prostate cancer adopted at our institution. Results: IMPT plans with two optimized angles achieved significant improvements in rectum sparing and moderate improvements in bladder sparing against those with two lateral angles. Plans with three optimized angles further improved rectum sparing significantly over those two-angle plans, whereas four-angle plans found no advantage over three-angle plans. A possible three-beam class solution for localized prostate patients was suggested and demonstrated with preserved dosimetric benefits because individually optimized three-angle solutions were found sharing a very similar pattern. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated the potential of using an improved <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> arrangement to better exploit the theoretical dosimetric benefits of proton therapy and provided insights of selecting quality <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> for localized prostate cancer treatment...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{selection}} of suitable <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and weights in external-beam radiotherapy is at present generally {{based upon the}} experience of the planner. Therefore, automated {{selection of}} <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and weights in forward-planned radiotherapy will be beneficial. Material and Methods: In this work, an efficient method is presented within the MATLAB environment to investigate how to improve the dose distributions by selecting suitable coplanar <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and weights for the beam. In the <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> and weight selection algorithm, the optimal <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and weights correspond to the lowest objective function value of the dose distributions of each group of candidate beams. Optimal weights and angles reach a balance between all the objectives. In this work, we used a genetic algorithm and adopted a real-number encoding method to represent both <b>beam</b> weights and <b>angles</b> with an assignable number of repetitions. For the evolution of this algorithm, we used both monophasic and biphasic methods. In monophasic evolution, the chromosome containing the weights and angles is evolved in a single phase. In biphasic evolution, the chromosome is evolved while keeping one parameter (e. g., weight) constant and then, in the second phase, the evolution is continued while keeping the other parameter (e. g., angle) constant. The dose calculation was carried out using “correction-based techniques”. Result: Simple and simulated clinical cases are presented to test the algorithm. They show that the biphasic evolution requires more computation time compared to monophasic (typically 40 and 20 minutes respectively) but results in a better optimization. Conclusion: The results show the efficacy of the algorithm and its fairly acceptable computation time...|$|R
40|$|Beam {{orientation}} optimization (BOO) is a {{key component}} {{in the process of}} IMRT treatment planning. It determines to what degree one can achieve a good treatment plan quality in the subsequent plan optimization process. In this paper, we have developed a BOO algorithm via adaptive l_ 1 minimization. Specifically, we introduce a sparsity energy function term into our model which contains weighting factors for each <b>beam</b> <b>angle</b> adaptively adjusted during the optimization process. Such an energy term favors small number of <b>beam</b> <b>angles.</b> By optimizing a total energy function containing a dosimetric term and the sparsity term, we are able to identify the unimportant <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and gradually remove them without largely sacrificing the dosimetric objective. In one typical prostate case, the convergence property of our algorithm, as well as the how the <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> are selected during the optimization process, is demonstrated. Fluence map optimization (FMO) is then performed based on the optimized <b>beam</b> <b>angles.</b> The resulted plan quality is presented and found to be better than that obtained from unoptimized (equiangular) beam orientations. We have further systematically validated our algorithm in the contexts of 5 - 9 coplanar beams for 5 prostate cases and 1 head and neck case. For each case, the final FMO objective function value is used to compare the optimized beam orientations and the equiangular ones. It is found that, our BOO algorithm can lead to beam configurations which attain lower FMO objective function values than corresponding equiangular cases, indicating the effectiveness of our BOO algorithm.

40|$|A {{new concept}} of using an {{electrically}} insulating beam as a constraint is proposed to construct planar spring-like electro-thermal actuators with large displacements. On {{the basis of}} this concept, three types of microspring actuators with multi-chevron structures and constraint beams are introduced. The constraint beams in one type (the spring) of these devices are horizontally positioned to restrict the expansion of the active arms in the x-direction, and to produce a displacement in the y-direction only. In the other two types of actuators (the deflector and the contractor), the constraint beams are positioned parallel to the active arms. When the constraint beams are on the inner side of the active arms, the actuator produces an outward deflection in the y-direction. When they are {{on the outside of the}} active arms, the actuator produces an inward contraction. Finite-element analysis was used to model the performances. The simulation shows that the displacements of these microspring actuators are all proportional to the number of the chevron sections in series, thus achieving superior displacements to alternative actuators. The displacement of a spring actuator strongly depends on the <b>beam</b> <b>angle,</b> and decreases with increasing the <b>beam</b> <b>angle,</b> the deflector is insensitive to the <b>beam</b> <b>angle,</b> while the displacement of a contractor actuator increases with the <b>beam</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R
