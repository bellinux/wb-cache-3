5|$|Joe Shea got up {{and started}} calmly with {{a report on the}} state of the investigation. But within a minute, he was <b>rambling,</b> and in another thirty seconds, he was incoherent. I looked at him and saw my father, in the grip of {{dementia}} praecox. It was horrifying and fascinating at the same time.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} September 5, 1972, tourism {{minister}} Manuel Elizalde called {{each member}} of Manila's foreign press corps to a party. Imelda arrived at the party, allegedly <b>rambling</b> about democracy and how only the Americans could afford it. On that same day, Martial Law was announced.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{at least}} the early 20th century, the {{seclusion}} of The <b>Ramble</b> {{has been used for}} private homosexual encounters. In the 1920s, the lawn at the north end was referred to as the [...] "fruited plain", and in the 1950s and 1960s, The <b>Ramble</b> was feared by many as a haven for [...] "anti-social persons". In the early 1960s, under Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., the parks department proposed building a senior center in the <b>Ramble</b> with the hope of curbing gay encounters and anti-gay assaults. Today, The <b>Ramble's</b> strong reputation for cruising for sex has given way somewhat to nature walks and environmentalism. However, some in the gay community still consider The <b>Ramble</b> to be [...] "ground zero for outdoor gay sex", enjoying the [...] "retro feel" [...] of sneaking off into the woods. As a tradition much older than Christopher Street and Fire Island, The <b>Ramble</b> continues to be a gay icon even in the more open environment of modern New York.|$|R

5|$|The bonus track OSIdea 9 {{features}} audio {{clips of}} former chess world champion Robert 'Bobby' Fischer's <b>rambling</b> {{interview with a}} radio station after his arrest in Japan, in which he asserts that the U.S. government will torture and murder him once extradited back to the country.|$|E
5|$|At age 15, Northrup {{moved in}} with sister Helen and her husband Jack, while she {{finished}} high school. Parsons had subdivided the house, a <b>rambling</b> mansion {{next door to the}} estate of Adolphus Busch (which later became the first Busch Gardens), into 19 apartments which he populated with a mixture of artists, writers, scientists and occultists. Her parents not only knew about her unconventional living arrangements but supported Parsons' group financially.|$|E
25|$|A wooded {{section of}} the park, called the <b>Ramble</b> and Lake, is popular among birders. Many species of {{woodland}} birds, especially warblers, {{may be seen in}} the <b>Ramble</b> in the spring and the fall.|$|R
50|$|The Bogle <b>Ramble</b> is {{a shorter}} {{alternative}} to the Bogle Stroll, covering approximately 26 miles around the north of Manchester. Participants don’t walk through the night during this event and instead walk the North Bogle Loop, before finishing back at the start point. The Bogle <b>Ramble</b> is sometimes misinterpreted as a marathon, yet the Bogle <b>Ramble</b> covers difficult terrain with open roads and is therefore not recommended to be run.|$|R

5|$|Janina Miller San Miguel (born November 14, 1990) is a Filipino {{beauty queen}} who was crowned Binibining Pilipinas World at the Binibining Pilipinas 2008 beauty pageant. She gained notoriety for her {{performance}} in the pageant's question and answer portion, where she lost her composure and gave an unfocused and <b>rambling</b> response with a thick accent. A video of the incident has garnered millions of views on websites such as YouTube.|$|E
5|$|Leisure {{activities}} {{available in}} the county include beach activities, <b>rambling,</b> cycling, sea fishing, canoeing, sailing and horse riding. Many of the towns and villages along the coast have small harbours and facilities for sailing, dolphin watching and other maritime activities. The River Teifi is a renowned salmon fishing river and also has a series of rapids near Llandysul where canoeing, kayaking and white water rafting take place.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{was taken}} to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in {{cultivation}} in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well, but will grow in full sun or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a <b>rambling</b> ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a rockery.|$|E

50|$|Since 1989, {{part of the}} James Joyce <b>Ramble’s</b> {{mission has}} been the {{protection}} of human rights. Organizers have supported such controversial writers as Václav Havel, Xu Wenli, Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi, and many others. Since {{the start of the}} Iraq War, the <b>Ramble</b> has turned their human rights focus to the support of journalists, including the late Daniel Pearl of The Wall Street Journal and Jill Carroll of the Christian Science Monitor. The organizers of the James Joyce <b>Ramble</b> have made great strides to help protect the First Amendment rights of journalists all over the world. Besides fighting for human rights, all the financial proceeds from the race, Take a Walk and the Children’s <b>Ramble</b> are donated to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.|$|R
5|$|After its broadcast, {{the special}} {{received}} critical acclaim; critics praised Gaga's performance, but doubted her sincerity during her on-stage <b>rambling</b> and in pre-concert scenes. The special {{was nominated for}} five honors at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards: Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special; Outstanding Directing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Special; Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video Control for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special; Outstanding Picture Editing for a Special (Single or Multi-Camera); and Outstanding Lighting Design/Lighting Direction for a Variety, Music or Comedy Special.|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its <b>rambling</b> disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
5|$|The Homosexual Matrix was {{controversial}} and received many negative reviews. It {{was criticized for}} Tripp's alleged bias in favor of homosexuality, dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, <b>rambling</b> style, sexism, focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, including an ethics complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Tripp himself believed that it had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Commentators have supported Tripp's view that erotic feeling depends on resistance to its satisfaction.|$|E

5|$|The film {{required}} {{large and}} ambitious sets to be constructed, from the Shaft of Hands to the <b>rambling,</b> distorted Goblin City where the film's climactic battle takes place. The Shaft of Hands sequence was filmed on a rig that was roughly forty feet high, and required {{nearly a hundred}} performers to operate the grey, scaly hands integral to the scene. Connelly was strapped into a harness when shooting the scene, and would spend time between takes suspended midway up the shaft.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made <b>rambling,</b> incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School {{opened a}} new music wing, and Holst {{composed}} St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and {{his family moved to}} a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample <b>rambling</b> opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.|$|E

5|$|On a {{freezing}} Sunday morning, Marge gathers {{the family}} to go to church. Homer refuses to go, much to her annoyance and dismay, after he sees the weather outside and accidentally tears his church trousers. Staying behind, he sleeps in late, dances in his underwear (à la Tom Cruise in the film Risky Business), makes his special waffle recipe, wins a radio trivia contest, watches an action-packed football game, and finds a penny. Homer attributes his good fortune to skipping church and declares it the best day of his life. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids shiver {{their way through a}} <b>rambling</b> sermon, only to find themselves trapped at the end since the door has frozen shut. The congregation is forced to stay longer while Groundskeeper Willie defrosts the doors, and then Marge is unable to start her car because of the cold.|$|E
5|$|The infamous Australian bushranger, Ned Kelly, made {{possibly}} {{his most}} daring raid in the Riverina, at Jerilderie in 1879. After riding overland from north east Victoria, Kelly {{and his gang}} in a brazen move captured two local policemen and stole their uniforms. Impersonating the police, they then proceeded to rob the Bank of New South Wales and held the town captive for several days. While in Jerilderie, he sought to have his manifesto published, the famous Jerilderie letter, a <b>rambling</b> 8,000 word condemnation of the colonial administration in Victoria and specifically {{the treatment of the}} Irish. Being unable to find the local newspaper editor, he left the letter with a member of the bank staff and returned to Victoria £2,000 richer.|$|E
5|$|The typical contact {{call of the}} {{goldcrest}} is a thin, high-pitched zee {{given at}} intervals of 1–4 seconds, with all the notes at the same pitch. It sometimes has a more clipped ending, or is delivered more rapidly. The call is higher and less rough {{than that of the}} firecrest. The song of the male goldcrest is a very high, thin double note cedar, repeated 5–7 times and ending in a flourish, cedarcedar-cedar-cedar-cedar-stichi-see-pee. The entire song lasts 3–4 seconds and is repeated 5–7 times a minute. This song, often uttered while the male is foraging, can be heard in most months of the year. There is also a subdued <b>rambling</b> subsong. Male goldcrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the common firecrest, but the reverse is apparently not true, since the songs of the common firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives.|$|E
