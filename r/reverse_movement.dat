25|$|With the <b>reverse</b> <b>movement</b> of the New Great Migration, the South {{has been}} the gaining region for black {{migrants}} coming from all three other census regions, especially from 1995 to 2000. The chief gaining states have been Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, Maryland, Virginia and Tennessee. In the same period, Georgia, Texas and Maryland attracted the most black college graduates. Houston and Dallas center cities have lost black population as the middle class has moved to the suburbs. In a change from previous settlement patterns, new regional migrants settle directly in the suburbs, the areas of largest residential growth and often the location of jobs as well. In addition to Atlanta, the top metropolitan areas attracting African Americans include Orlando, Jacksonville and Tallahassee, Florida; and Charlotte, North Carolina.|$|E

40|$|A compact linear {{positioning}} stage {{using one}} microgripper and one piezoelectric stack is presented {{based on the}} parasitic motion principle. Characteristics of the linear positioning stage along the positive y-axis and the negative y-axis are measured and compared with each other. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} linear positioning stage has features of the large motion range, various movement velocities and stepping displacement, and forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>movements.</b> Meanwhile, the positioning stage has good resolution and enough load capacity. Possible reasons leading to nonlinearity and velocity difference between forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>movements</b> are discussed.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5, <b>reverse</b> {{polarity}} <b>movements</b> were recognized {{during the initial}} part of the tilt changes at 7 : 32 a.m. on June 29, 2015. These initial <b>reverse</b> polarity <b>movements</b> may indicate the subsidence of the mountain edifice associated with the contraction of thee shallow pressure sources, {{as shown by the}} schematic in Fig.  5. Alternatively, the initial movements could be interpreted as a response to translational motion. Here, we discuss whether the observed <b>reverse</b> <b>movements</b> reflect a source process (i.e., subsidence of the volcano before its inflation). The <b>reverse</b> polarity <b>movements</b> shown in Figs.  3 and 5 have a duration of less than 30  s, which is in the frequency range of a response for displacement. In the following, we attempt to explain the initial tilt motions by the contamination through the displacement response of the tilt meters shown in Kokubo (2013).|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{cognitive}} background of unconscious visuomotor control of complex sports movements. Therefore, we investigated the extent to which novices and skilled high-jump athletes are able to identify visually presented body postures of the high jump unconsciously. We also asked whether or not the manner of processing differs (qualitatively or quantitatively) between these groups as a function of their motor expertise. A priming experiment with not consciously perceivable stimuli was designed to determine whether subliminal priming of movement phases (same vs. different movement phases) or temporal order (i. e. natural vs. <b>reversed</b> <b>movement</b> order) affects target processing. Participants had to decide which phase of the high jump (approach vs. flight phase) a target photograph was taken from. We found a main effect of temporal order for skilled athletes, that is, faster reaction times for prime-target pairs that reflected the natural movement order as opposed to the <b>reversed</b> <b>movement</b> order. This result indicates that temporal-order information pertaining to the domain of expertise plays a critical role in athletes’ perceptual capacities. For novices, data analyses revealed an interaction between temporal order and movement phases. That is, only the <b>reversed</b> <b>movement</b> order of flight-approach pictures increased processing time. Taken together, the results suggest that the structure of cognitive movement representation modulates unconscious processing of movement pictures and points to a functional role of motor representations in visual perception...|$|R

50|$|The northwestern side of Honshu lies on {{the southeastern}} margin of the Sea of Japan, an area of oceanic crust created by back-arc {{spreading}} from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The extensional tectonics associated with the spreading formed a series of N-S trending extensional faults and associated basins.

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{investigations}} {{showed that}} kinematics and muscle activity associated with natural whole-body movements along the gravity direction present modular organizations encoding specific aspects relative {{to both the}} motor plans and the motor programmes underlying movement execution. It is, however, still unknown whether such modular structures characterize also the <b>reverse</b> <b>movements,</b> when the displacement {{of a large number}} of joints is required to take the whole body back to a standing initial posture. To study what motor patterns are conserved across the reversal of movement direction, principal component analysis and non-negative matrix factorization were therefore applied, respectively, to the time series describing the temporal evolution of the elevation angles associated with all the body links and to the electromyographic signals of both natural and <b>reverse</b> whole-body <b>movements.</b> Results revealed that elevation angles were highly co-varying in time and that despite some differences in the global parameters characterizing the different movements (indicating differences in high-level variable associated with the selected motor plans), the level of joint co-variation did not change across movement direction. In contrast, muscle organization of the forward whole-body pointing tasks was found to be different with respect to that characterizing the <b>reverse</b> <b>movements.</b> Such results agree with previous findings, according to which the central nervous system exploits, dependently on the direction of motion, different motor plans for the execution of whole-body movements. However, in addition, this study shows how such motor plans are translated into different muscle strategies that equivalently assure a high level of co-variation in the joint space...|$|R

The high degree of coupling across the plate boundary where the Carnegie Ridge is being subducted beneath northern Ecuador causes unusually intense intraplate deformation. Known faults within the area of the earthquake epicenters are the SSW-NNE trending San Isidro, El Ángel, Río Ambi and Otavalo Faults, all considered to be dextral strike-slip faults, sometimes with <b>reverse</b> <b>movement.</b> All these faults are interpreted to have moved in the last 1.6 million years.|$|E
