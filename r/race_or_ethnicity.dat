25|$|Another {{theory on}} {{cultural}} assimilation {{centers on the}} racial/ethnic disadvantage model. This theory emphasizes {{that the process of}} assimilation for certain immigrant groups is blocked due to their <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> meaning that discrimination in society and in the workplace hinders assimilation into mainstream U.S. society. The major critique of this theory is that it overstresses social barriers along racial and ethnic lines without providing adequate explanations for why many second-generation immigrants overcome these barriers and experience socioeconomic mobility.|$|E
5000|$|The donor's <b>race</b> <b>or</b> ethnic {{background}} is sometimes important since certain blood types, especially rare ones, {{are more common}} in certain ethnic groups.

50|$|People who {{supported}} the 1924 Immigration Act often used eugenics as justification for restriction of certain <b>races</b> <b>or</b> <b>ethnicities</b> of people {{in order to prevent}} the spread of feeblemindedness in American society. Most proponents of the law were rather concerned with upholding an ethnic status quo and avoiding competition with foreign workers. Samuel Gompers, a Jewish immigrant and founder of the AFL, supported the Act because he opposed the cheap labor that immigration represented, despite the fact that the Act would sharply reduce Jewish immigration.|$|R
5000|$|Homogamy {{can also}} fall under gender. In this case, {{homogamy}} would refer to two partners {{of the same}} gender marrying one another. Same sex couples have {{much more of a}} variation connection among straight sex couples. Same sex couples are more open-minded, democratic, and accepting of nontraditional relationships [...] These groups of couples have shaped social norms from age to education to relationships across race/ethnic lines. Same-sex couples are likely to engage themselves in relationships around different <b>races</b> <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity</b> because of their mind set.|$|R
25|$|A record 14.6% {{of all new}} {{marriages in}} the United States in 2008 were between spouses of a {{different}} <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity</b> from one another. This compares to 8.0% of all current marriages regardless of when they occurred. This includes marriages between a Hispanic and non-Hispanic (Hispanics are an ethnic group, not a race) as well as marriages between spouses of different races– be they white, black, Asian, American Indian or those who identify as being of multiple races or some other race.|$|E

25|$|The Fair Housing Act makes {{explicit}} the unlawfulness {{of discrimination}} against any member of a protected class, including religion, age, disability, gender, and race. Refusal of housing based on the profiling of linguistic traits is clearly illegal, yet evidence must be found that the housing authority in question could indeed effectively determine the <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity</b> of the applicant. In this way linguistic studies {{on the ability of}} lay persons to correctly identify race or ethnic groups based on auditory cues proves helpful to anti-discrimination law.|$|E

30|$|Alternatives to race—for example ethnicity—often {{seem to come}} to be {{used and}} {{understood}} {{in the same way}} as race (Condit 2007; Oppenheimer 2001, Sankar and Cho 2002). There is some evidence of a similar definition slippage with respect to ‘ancestry’ in our dataset, most insidiously where inferred populations labels assigned through genetic ancestry assessment were referred to as <b>races</b> <b>or</b> <b>ethnicities</b> (Table  7). Again, requiring the definition of race, ethnicity and ancestry by authors would highlight their differing utility in addressing different biomedical questions, and assist in prising apart conflation between social and genetic identity.|$|R

25|$|Socioeconomic {{status of}} mothers likely has a larger {{influence}} on breastfeeding adherence than <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> {{as many women}} {{who are members of}} groups with low breastfeeding rates also have a low socioeconomic status. Among women born in the United States, women who are wealthier are more likely to breastfeed. In addition, employment can influence the decision to breastfeed. When either parent was unemployed or held a lower-status occupation (such as labor or sales), their children were more likely to never have been breastfed. In addition, women with public insurance or with no health insurance are more likely to never have breastfed their children, as are women who receive WIC.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, a parent, William Capacchione, {{sued the}} school system when his {{daughter}} was denied entrance into a magnet school {{for the second time}} based on her race. While {{the school system}} opposed the end of busing, Judge Robert D. Potter declared the mandate of a unitary system had been met and lifted the court order on mandatory busing by <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity.</b> This ruling was upheld by the appeals court in Richmond, Virginia in 2000 and after the final appeal was declined to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, federal order of busing was ended in Charlotte-Mecklenburg and it was left {{in the hands of the}} city school board to decide how to redo the assignment policy for school attendance.|$|E
25|$|Novelists {{come from}} a variety of {{backgrounds}} and social classes, and frequently this shapes the content of their works. Public reception of a novelist's work, the literary criticism commenting on it, and the novelists' incorporation of their own experiences into works and characters can lead to the author's personal life and identity being associated with a novel's fictional content. For this reason, the environment within which a novelist works and the reception of their novels by both the public and publishers can be influenced by their demographics or identity; important among these culturally constructed identities are gender, sexual identity, social class, <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> nationality, religion, and an association with place. Similarly, some novelists have creative identities derived from their focus on different genres of fiction, such as crime, romance or historical novels.|$|E

25|$|By the 19th century {{theories}} that Jesus {{was of the}} Aryan race, and in particular of Nordic appearance, were developed and later appealed to advocates of the new racial antisemitism, who wanted nothing Jewish about Jesus. Houston Stewart Chamberlain posited Jesus was of Amorite-Germanic extraction. The Amorites were actually a Semitic people. Madison Grant claimed Jesus for the Nordic race. This found its most extreme form in the Nazi theology of Positive Christianity. Scholars supporting the radical Aryan view also argued that being a Jew by religion was distinguishable from being a Jew by <b>race</b> <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity.</b> These theories usually also include the reasoning that Jesus was Aryan because Galilee was supposedly a non-Jewish region speaking an unknown Indo-European language, but this has not gained scholarly acceptance (in fact, Galilee had a significant non-Jewish minority, but these spoke various local Semitic languages).|$|E
