50|$|EV {{certificates}} {{are standard}} X.509 digital certificates. The primary way to identify an EV certificate is by referencing the Certificate Policies extension field.

As with <b>root</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>authorities</b> in general, browsers may not recognize all issuers.|$|R
40|$|Security in browsers {{is based}} upon users trusting a set of <b>root</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>Authorities</b> (called Trust Anchors) which they may know little or nothing about. Browser vendors face a {{difficult}} challenge to provide an appropriate interface for users. Providing usable Trust Anchor Management (TAM) for users, applications and PKI deployers is a complex task. The PKIX working group at Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) {{is working on a}} new protocol, the Trust Anchor Management Protocol (TAMP), which will provide a standardized method to automatically manage trust anchors in applications and devices. Although promising, this protocol does not go far enough to allow users to gather information about previously unknown trust anchors in an automatic fashion. We have proposed the PKI Resource Query Protocol (PRQP) —which is currently an Internet Draft on Experimental Track with IETF—to provide applications with an automatic discovery system for PKI management. In this paper we describe the basic architecture and capabilities of PRQP that allow Browsers to provide a more complete set of trust anchor management services. We also provide the design of a PRQP enabled infrastructure that uses a trust association mechanism to provide an easy solution for managing Trust Anchors for Virtual Organizations...|$|R

50|$|When a key {{is known}} to be {{compromised}} it could be fixed by revoking the certificate, but such a compromise is not easily detectable and can be a huge security breach.

50|$|In {{a public}} key infrastructure, {{the chain of}} trusted {{authorities}} begins with the <b>root</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>authority</b> (root CA). Once the root CA is installed and its root certificate is created, the next action taken by the administrator of the root CA is to issue certificates authorizing intermediate (or subordinate) CAs. This creates the ability to issue, distribute and revoke digital certificates without the direct action of the root CA. Because {{the consequences of a}} compromised root CA are so great (up to and including the need to re-issue each and every certificate in the PKI), all root CAs must be kept safe from unauthorized access. A common method to ensure the security and integrity of a root CA is to keep it in an offline state. It is only brought online when needed for specific, infrequent tasks, typically limited to the issuance or re-issuance of certificates authorizing intermediate CAs.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} aspects of this E-governance and E-commerce model is security. Security gives {{assurance}} that the communicating entity {{is the one that}} it claims to be (Authentication). Security gives Protection of data from unauthorized disclosure (Confidentiality). A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a foundation on which other applications, system, and network security components are built. A PKI is an essential component of an overall security strategy that must work in concert with other security mechanisms, business practices, and risk management efforts. PKI is a model where a set of certificate authority will work together to serve a specific purpose, it can be enterprise wide or country wide.

5000|$|A <b>certificate</b> <b>authority</b> can issue {{multiple}} certificates in {{the form}} of a tree structure.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{certificate}} masquerading against the SSL protocol is pointed out in [4]. In [4], various forms of server certificate masquerading are identified. It {{should also be noted}} that the attack described is a man-in-themiddle (MITM) attack that requires direct manipulation of the SSL protocol. This paper is a mirror of [4] and involves client certificate masquerading. The motivation for this paper comes from the fact that this anomaly has shown up in commercial products. It is potentially more damaging than [4] since a MITM attack is not involved and the only requirement is that the application trust a given <b>root</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>authority</b> (CA). The problem arises when applications use multiple roots that do not cross-certify. The problem is further exasperated since the applications themselves do not have the ability to apply external name constraints and policies. Unfortunately, the problem is a fairly well known problem within the public key infrastructure (PKI) community, but continues to persist in practice despite this knowledge. 1...|$|E
40|$|Jackson and Barth[1], {{in their}} paper "Beware of Finer-Grained Origins " (May 2008), {{describe}} {{a number of}} HTTP session attributes beyond Same Origin Policy(SOP) that are used by web browsers to make security decisions. One of the attributes that the paper discusses {{is the type of}} SSL certificate presented by a web server when negotiating a secure connection. Modern web browsers support both domain validated (DV) and extended validation (EV) SSL certificates. EV SSL certificates were created to combat phishing and other web based spoofing attacks which succeed in spite of the DV SSL model for web site identification. The EV SSL model improves upon the DV model in two ways. First, certificate authorities enforce a more thorough off-line validation process in order to more accurately identify the agent requesting the certificate as the owner of the domain which the certificate is for. Second, when a certificate chains up to an EV <b>root</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>authority</b> (CA), EV-capable web browsers display the web sites identity information next to, or in, the address bar. This identity information is usually contained in a green badge, showing what certificate authority Verisign refers to as the “green glow. ” While Jackson and Barth describe a specific flaw in the Same Origin Policy that could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript into an EV SSL page, this paper describes two other short comings i...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} an invisible adaptive attack (IAA) against cryptographic protocols. Or rather, it is a class of attacks, where the protocol itself is the attack, and where this cannot be seen by the security model. As an example, assume that we have some cryptographic security model M and assume that we have a current setting of the real world with some crypto-graphic infrastructure in place, like a PKI. Select some object from this real world infrastructure, like the public key, pk 0, of some <b>root</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>authority</b> (CA). Now design a protocol pi, which is secure in M. Then massage it into p̂i, which runs exactly like pi, except that if the public key pk of the root CA happens to be pk 0, then it will be completely insecure. Of course p̂i should be considered insecure. However, in current security models existing infrastructure is modelled by generating it at random in the experiment defining security. Therefore, in the model, the root CA will have a fresh, random public key pk. Hence pk 6 = pk 0, except with negligible probability, and thus M will typically deem p̂i secure. The problem is that to notice the above attack in a security model, we need to properly model the correlation between p̂i and pk. However, this correlation was made by the adversary and it is näıve to believe that he will report this correlation correctly to the security model. It is the protocol itself and how to model it which is the attack. Furthermore, sinc...|$|E
50|$|Thus {{the browser}} can verify the SSL cert of the website {{by means of}} the loaded group of {{accepted}} <b>certificates</b> or the <b>root</b> <b>certificates</b> can be looked up in an X.500 or LDAP Directory (or via HTTP/S) and imported into the list of trusted <b>Certificate</b> <b>Authorities.</b>|$|R
50|$|In contrast, {{a typical}} X.509 PKI permits each {{certificate}} {{to be signed}} only by a single party: a <b>certificate</b> <b>authority</b> (CA). The CA's certificate may itself be signed by a different CA, {{all the way up}} to a 'self-signed' <b>root</b> <b>certificate.</b> <b>Root</b> <b>certificates</b> must be available to those who use a lower level CA certificate and so are typically distributed widely. They are for instance, distributed with such applications as browsers and email clients. In this way SSL/TLS-protected Web pages, email messages, etc. can be authenticated without requiring users to manually install <b>root</b> <b>certificates.</b> Applications commonly include over one hundred <b>root</b> <b>certificates</b> from dozens of PKIs, thus by default bestowing trust throughout the hierarchy of certificates which lead back to them.|$|R
50|$|An organization's trusted <b>root</b> <b>certificates</b> can be {{distributed}} to all employees {{so that they can}} use the company PKI system. Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Safari and Chrome come with a predetermined set of <b>root</b> <b>certificates</b> pre-installed, so SSL certificates from major <b>certificate</b> <b>authorities</b> will work instantly; in effect the browsers' developers determine which CAs are trusted third parties for the browsers' users. For example, Firefox provides a CSV and/or HTML file containing a list of Included CAs.|$|R
50|$|In June 2015, Let's Encrypt {{generated}} an RSA <b>root</b> <b>certificate</b> {{with its}} private key stored on a hardware security module which is kept offline. The <b>root</b> <b>certificate</b> {{is used to}} sign two intermediate certificates which are cross-signed by the <b>certificate</b> <b>authority</b> IdenTrust. One of the intermediate certificates is used to sign issued certificates, while the other is kept offline as a backup in case of problems with the first intermediate certificate. Because the IdenTrust certificate is preinstalled in major web browsers, Let's Encrypt certificates can normally be validated and are accepted upon installation, out of the box, even while no browser vendors include the ISRG <b>root</b> <b>certificate</b> as a trust anchor.|$|R
50|$|The {{certification}} path validation algorithm is the algorithm which verifies {{that a given}} certificate path is valid under a given public key infrastructure (PKI).

50|$|At {{the heart}} of every <b>certificate</b> <b>authority</b> (CA) {{is at least one}} root key or <b>root</b> <b>certificate</b> and usually at least one {{intermediate}} <b>root</b> <b>certificate.</b> A <b>root</b> key is a term for a unique passcode that must be generated for secure server interaction with a protective network, usually called the root zone. Prompts for information from this zone can be done through a server. The keys and certificates mentioned are the credentials and safe guards for the system. These digital certificates are made from a public and a private key.|$|R

50|$|Current web browsers carry pre-installed {{intermediary}} certificates issued {{and signed}} by a <b>Certificate</b> <b>Authority.</b> This means browsers need to carry {{a large number of}} different certificate providers, increasing the risk of a key compromise.

5000|$|However, {{the market}} for {{globally}} trusted TLS/SSL server certificates is largely held by {{a small number of}} multinational companies. This market has significant barriers to entry due to the technical requirements. While not legally required, new providers may choose to undergo annual security audits (such as WebTrust for <b>certificate</b> <b>authorities</b> in North America and ETSI in Europe) to be included as a trusted root by a web browser or operating system. More than 180 <b>root</b> <b>certificates</b> are trusted in the Mozilla Firefox web browser, representing approximately eighty organizations.

5000|$|In typical {{public key}} {{infrastructure}} (PKI) arrangements, a digital signature from a <b>certificate</b> <b>authority</b> (CA) attests that a particular public key certificate is valid (i.e., contains correct information).

5000|$|These {{packages}} of certificates {{can be added}} or removed by the end user in their software, but are reviewed by Microsoft and Mozilla {{in terms of their}} continued trustworthiness.

50|$|In the X.509 trust model, a <b>certificate</b> <b>authority</b> (CA) is {{responsible}} for signing certificates. These certificates act as an introduction between two parties, which means that a CA acts as a trusted third party. A CA processes requests from people or organizations requesting certificates (called subscribers), verifies the information, and potentially signs an end-entity certificate based on that information. To perform this role effectively, a CA needs to have one or more broadly trusted <b>root</b> <b>certificates</b> or intermediate certificates and the corresponding private keys. CAs may achieve this broad trust by having their <b>root</b> <b>certificates</b> included in popular software, or by obtaining a cross-signature from another CA delegating trust. Other CAs are trusted within a relatively small community, like a business, and are distributed by other mechanisms like Windows Group Policy.|$|R
