If any jackstraws have fallen free from the pile, you may <b>remove</b> them first. Each time you succeed in <b>removing</b> one, keep it and try to <b>remove</b> another. Once you've started to <b>remove</b> a jackstraw, you can't change your mind and decide to <b>remove</b> another. If, at any time, you wish to use your fingers instead of the hook, you may do so.|$|R
5|$|All tracks {{except the}} few yards {{embedded}} in the quayside at Watchet were <b>removed</b> by 1920, but other features were <b>removed</b> or altered piecemeal over time.

5|$|Although {{both sides}} claimed victory, neither {{achieved}} all their objectives; the JNA garrison evacuated the Logorište barracks, but Croatian defences elsewhere held. Particularly heavy fighting {{was reported in}} the Karlovac suburb of Turanj, identified as the primary axis of the JNA effort. While the JNA <b>removed</b> some weapons and equipment stored in the Logorište barracks, the remaining supplies were <b>removed</b> by the ZNG over a one-week period after the battle.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} logic with the dynamic modal {{operators}} copy and <b>remove.</b> The copy operator replicates a given model, and the <b>remove</b> operator <b>removes</b> paths {{in a given}} model. We show that the product update by an action model (with Boolean pre-conditions) in dynamic epistemic logic decomposes in copy and <b>remove</b> operations. We also show that copy and <b>remove</b> operators (of path of length 1) can be expressed by action models. We investigate {{the complexity of the}} satisfiability problem of syntactic fragments of the logic with copy and <b>remove</b> operations...|$|R
5|$|As the Interstate was completed, the {{highways}} that it replaced were <b>removed</b> {{from the state}} highway system.

The three 277Q radars were replaced with updated American and Dutch designs: a LW-02 air search set and a SPN-35 landing aid radar.

5|$|England {{set about}} {{extending}} their first innings lead {{for the remainder}} of the fourth day. For the second time in the match, Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership. Johnston <b>removed</b> Washbrook for 65 before Johnson <b>removed</b> Hutton for 57 without further addition to the total, leaving England at 129/2. Edrich and Compton continued where the openers had left off, adding 103 for the third wicket before Lindwall trapped Edrich for 54. Crapp came in and added 18 before Lindwall bowled him at 260/4 and precipitated a mini-collapse. Yardley made seven before Johnston <b>removed</b> him. Johnston then <b>removed</b> Cranston caught behind for a duck with only a further run added to leave England at 278/6. When Johnston <b>removed</b> Compton for 66, caught by Miller, England were 7/293 with no recognised batsmen remaining. They had lost 4/33. Wicket-keeper Evans was joined by Bedser, and the pair added 37 before Miller <b>removed</b> the latter.

The other theory holds that Ljotić was buried in Šempeter pri Gorici until the signing of the Treaty of Osimo in 1977, when his followers <b>removed</b> his body from the tomb {{in which it was}} buried and took it to an unknown location outside Yugoslavia, possibly to Italy.|$|E
