50|$|In computing, error <b>{{recovery}}</b> <b>control</b> (ERC) (Western Digital: time-limited {{error recovery}} (TLER), Samsung/Hitachi: command completion time limit (CCTL)) is {{a feature of}} hard disks which allow a system administrator to configure {{the amount of time}} a drive's firmware is allowed to spend recovering from a read or write error. Limiting the recovery time allows for improved error handling in hardware or software RAID environments. In some cases, there is a conflict as to whether error handling should be undertaken by the hard drive or by the RAID implementation, which leads to drives being marked as unusable and significant performance degradation, when this could otherwise have been avoided.|$|E
5000|$|Frequently, a RAID {{controller}} is configured to [...] "drop" [...] {{a component}} drive (that is, {{to assume a}} component drive has failed) if the drive has been unresponsive for eight seconds or so; this might cause the array controller to drop a good drive because that drive has not been given enough time to complete its internal error recovery procedure. Consequently, using RAID for consumer-marketed drives can be risky, and so-called [...] "enterprise class" [...] drives limit this error recovery time to reduce risk. Western Digital's desktop drives {{used to have a}} specific fix. A utility called WDTLER.exe limited a drive's error recovery time. The utility enabled TLER (time limited error recovery), which limits the error recovery time to seven seconds. Around September 2009, Western Digital disabled this feature in their desktop drives (e.g. the Caviar Black line), making such drives unsuitable for use in RAID configurations. However, Western Digital enterprise class drives are shipped from the factory with TLER enabled. Similar technologies are used by Seagate, Samsung, and Hitachi. Of course, for non-RAID usage, an enterprise class drive with a short error recovery timeout that cannot be changed is therefore less suitable than a desktop drive. In late 2010, the Smartmontools program began supporting the configuration of ATA Error <b>Recovery</b> <b>Control,</b> allowing the tool to configure many desktop class hard drives for use in RAID setups.|$|E

40|$|Transaction {{management}} comprises {{different aspects}} such as concurrency control, <b>recovery</b> <b>control,</b> and replication control.

Then, we show how the requirement of serializability can be decomposed into requirements that can be attributed to concurrency control, to replication control, and to <b>recovery</b> <b>control,</b> respectively. Altogether, we obtain a unified theory of transaction management, where we focus on concurrency control and replication control in this paper. 1 Introduction Basically, a concurrent execution of some set of programs is called serializable if each of the programs appears as if it has been executed atomically [...] -without interference of the other prog [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development and implementation of an integrated air handling unit system for laboratory buildings, called the Laboratory Air Handling Unit (LAHU) system. This system minimizes thermal energy use and improves the office area indoor air quality (IAQ) in laboratory buildings. ^ Theoretical optimal airflow control schedules have been developed, implemented and tested to provide general guidelines for optimal outside air intake and return air distribution within the LAHU system for different weather and building load conditions. Theoretical optimal heat <b>recovery</b> <b>control</b> schedules have also been developed, implemented and tested to provide general guidelines for optimal heat recovery discharge air temperature control. The optimization methodology applied in this study can also be used to solve other linear optimization problems. ^ The dissertation describes and demonstrates the performance of the LAHU system using both theoretical energy analysis and experimental studies of an actual LAHU system implemented and tested in a real occupied university laboratory building. ^ Theoretical energy analysis suggests that the LAHU system can reduce annual energy by 20 % to 40 %, and introduce up to 100 % outside air to the office areas with the optimal airflow control, compared to conventional dedicated AHU systems typically used in laboratory buildings. The optimal heat <b>recovery</b> <b>control</b> of the LAHU can reduce the heat recovery pump power by up to 100 % during economizer mode and reduce thermal energy by up to 27 % for laboratory buildings in typical climates in the middle-west of the USA. ^ Compared with the conventional AHUs design, preliminary experimental results establish that between 24 % and 32 % less heating was required by the LAHU system implemented with the optimal outside air and heat <b>recovery</b> <b>control</b> in economizer mode. Further, heat recovery pump operation was reduced by 3, 000 hours, or 50 % per year. ^ The LAHU is an energy-efficient system for laboratory buildings. We hope that this dissertation and the results reported herein will serve as a guide for the implementation of the LAHU system into building design and operation. ...|$|E
