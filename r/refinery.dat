5|$|From late June the 315thBombardment Wing {{conducted}} {{a series of}} night precision bombing attacks against the Japanese oil industry, independently of the precision day and night incendiary raids. The wing's B-29s were fitted with the advanced AN/APQ-7 radar that allowed targets to be accurately located at night. Arriving in the Marianas in April 1945, the 315th underwent a period of operational training before flying its first attack against the Utsube Oil <b>Refinery</b> at Yokkaichi on the night of 26June. The 30 bombers (out of 38 dispatched) that struck the <b>refinery</b> destroyed or damaged 30percent of the facility. The unit's next attack was against a <b>refinery</b> at Kudamatsu three nights later, and on the night of 2July it struck another <b>refinery</b> at Minoshima. On the night of 6/7July the 315thBombardment Wing destroyed the Maruzen oil <b>refinery</b> near Osaka, and three nights later it completed the destruction of the Utsube <b>refinery.</b> The wing had conducted 15 operations against Japanese oil facilities {{by the end of the}} war. During these attacks it destroyed six of the nine targets attacked for the loss of four B-29s. However, as Japan had almost no crude oil to refine due to the Allied naval blockade of the home islands these raids had little impact on the country's war effort.|$|E
5|$|The sugar <b>refinery</b> was a four-story {{structure}} {{on the bank}} of the Savannah River. Imperial Sugar, based in Sugar Land, Texas, had bought the <b>refinery</b> and its brand name in 1997 from a previous local owner. Known since construction as the Dixie Crystal <b>refinery,</b> it was the main employer in the town of 3,500 prior to the disaster.|$|E
5|$|As Geralda moved ashore, the cyclone {{produced}} wind gusts {{as strong}} as , among the strongest gusts worldwide in several decades. The storm also dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides and severe flooding, mostly in Toamasina Province. About 80% {{of the city of}} Toamasina was destroyed, including the country's only petroleum <b>refinery</b> at the time. Damage to the <b>refinery</b> alone was estimated at $800,000.|$|E
50|$|Most large <b>refineries</b> {{are near}} navigable waterways, {{especially}} seaports or Great Lakes ports. The single largest concentration of <b>refineries</b> is along the Gulf Coast. Although there are <b>refineries</b> in 30 states, just three states dominate US refining: Texas (47 operating <b>refineries),</b> Louisiana (19), and California (18). As of January 2015, these three states contain 45% of all US <b>refineries</b> and 59% of all US refining capacity.|$|R
30|$|Specialty <b>refineries</b> usually {{refer to}} {{lubricating}} and base oil plants or asphalt <b>refineries.</b> <b>Refineries</b> integrated with petrochemical facilities typically employ {{a large amount}} of aromatics recovery and include cumene and cyclohexane units, ammonia and methanol synthesis.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{transportation}} {{costs associated with}} moving crude oil from the oil fields in Western Canada to the consuming regions {{in the east and}} the greater choice of crude qualities make it more economic for some <b>refineries</b> to use imported crude oil. Therefore, Canada’s oil economy is now a dual market. <b>Refineries</b> in Western Canada run domestically produced crude oil, <b>refineries</b> in Quebec and the eastern provinces run primarily imported crude oil, while <b>refineries</b> in Ontario run a mix of both imported and domestically produced crude oil. In more recent years, eastern <b>refineries</b> have begun running Canadian crude from east coast offshore production." ...|$|R
5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar <b>refinery</b> explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the <b>refinery,</b> {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E

By 1868, with Rockefeller {{continuing}} practices of borrowing and reinvesting profits, controlling costs, and using refineries' waste, the company owned two Cleveland refineries and a marketing subsidiary in New York; {{it was the largest}} oil <b>refinery</b> in the world. Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler was the predecessor of the Standard Oil Company.|$|E
5|$|On 30 December 1947, {{members of}} the Irgun, a Jewish {{underground}} militia, threw bombs into a crowd of Arabs outside {{the gates of the}} Consolidated Refineries in Haifa, killing six and injuring 42. In response Arab employees of the company killed 39 Jewish employees in {{what became known as the}} Haifa Oil <b>Refinery</b> massacre. The Jewish Haganah militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of Balad al-Shaykh, where many of the Arab <b>refinery</b> workers lived, in what became known as the Balad al-Shaykh massacre. Control of Haifa was critical in the ensuing civil war, since it was the major industrial and oil <b>refinery</b> port in British Palestine.|$|E

5|$|In Kyushu, {{officials}} evacuated over {{a quarter}} of a million people in fear of Typhoon Nabi affecting Japan. These continued after the storm made landfall to protect residents from flood waters and landslides. The first order during the storm took place in the Arita district. In Miyazaki City, 21,483households were evacuated following reports of significant overflow on the nearby river. Another 10,000residences were vacated in Nobeoka following similar reports. The entirety of the West Japan Railway Company was shut down. Canceled train services affected 77,800people on Shikoku. Ferry service was also shut down, cutting off transportation for tens of thousands of people. In addition, at least 723flights were cancelled because of the storm. Japan's second-largest <b>refinery,</b> Idemitsu Kosan, stopped shipments to other refineries across the area, and Japan's largest <b>refinery,</b> Nippon Oil, stopped all sea shipments. The Cosmo Oil Company, Japan's fourth largest <b>refinery,</b> stopped all shipments to Yokkaichi and Sakaide refineries. About 700schools in the country were closed. Approximately 1,500soldiers were dispatched to Tokyo to help coastal areas prepare for Typhoon Nabi's arrival, and to clean up after the storm.

Commercial shipping to the <b>refineries,</b> Piraeus, and to and from the canal make the gulf quite a busy area with commercial shipping.|$|R
50|$|Despite having {{very little}} oil production, Eastern Canada {{has a large}} number of oil <b>refineries.</b> The ones in Ontario were built close to the {{historic}} oil fields of southern Ontario; the ones in provinces to the east were built to process oil imported from other countries. After Leduc No. 1 was discovered in 1947, the much larger oil fields in Alberta began to supply Ontario <b>refineries.</b> After the 1973 oil crisis drastically increased the price of imported oil, the economics of <b>refineries</b> became unfavorable, and many of them closed. In particular, Montreal, which had six oil <b>refineries</b> in 1973, now has only one.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to these bank acquisitions, UBS also acquired an 80% stake in Argor SA, a Swiss precious metal <b>refinery</b> founded in 1951, through whom they started to issue UBS branded gold bars. In 1973, the bank increased the stake to full 100% ownership only to withdraw by 1999 with ownership of the <b>refinery</b> changing to Hereaus & Management. Nevertheless, UBS continues to issue gold bars via Argor-Heraeus which is famous for the unique kinebar holographic technology it uses to provide enhanced protection against bank gold bar counterfeiting.|$|E
