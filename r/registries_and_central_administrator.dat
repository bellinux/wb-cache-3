50|$|Throughout much of {{the early}} modern period, each Spanish realm {{retained}} its own freedoms and laws, and this included administrative and governance arrangements. Modes of taxation are {{an excellent example of}} the differing arrangements in the Spanish composite monarchy. The system of taxation in Spain varied depending on the kingdom or territory, and sometimes even within kingdoms there were special tax arrangements. The differing tax arrangements led to a reliance on the revenues from the Kingdom of Castile as opposed to other areas of Spain. While all of Spain was united under the same ruler, each territory was often treated very differently and was ruled by the King <b>and</b> <b>central</b> <b>administrators</b> in line with local customs and power structures. The king had more freedom to legislate in Catalonia than in the Kingdom of Aragon. Elites in Aragon and the Council that represented them were viewed as more powerful than elites in Catalonia. In the case of the petitions against hoarding, the King ignored the request to oppose the hoarding of grain in the case of Catalonia, while he accepted the request to oppose hoarding of grain in the Kingdom of Aragon. This demonstrates a different approach to governing each of the composite territories.|$|R

40|$|An {{emerging}} reform {{emphasis is}} {{the identification and}} sustainability of research-validated initiatives for improving student achievement. Many researchers have noted {{that the lack of}} sustainability of effective programs is a barrier to advancing systemic school reform. Reported are findings from a five-year, NSF/IERI-funded project designed to develop and refine a multi-phase scale-up model for concurrently initiating, sustaining, and expanding a systemic, research-validated, intervention, Science IDEAS, in grades 3 - 5. Described in the paper are (a) the evolution of the scale-up model and (b) the leadership and organizational dynamics used for scale up of the intervention. In doing so, the paper offers perspectives and recommendations applicable to the scale up of any systemic instructional intervention within an ongoing school reform initiative. Over the past 20 years, an increasingly important emphasis in school reform has been upon identifying research-validated, instructional initiatives that have the potential to improve student achievement. Building upon this, a complementary research literature has begun to address the related issue of identifying the conditions under which effective instructional initiatives can be sustained (Hargreaves & Fink, 2006) and expanded. For example, in his study of Chicago schools, Payne (1997; 2001) identified problematic elements which cumulatively undermined the implementation of effective reform initiatives. These included dysfunctional relationships among teachers, school <b>administrators,</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> <b>administrators</b> which interfered with actual program implementation [...] even though all parties were in agreement about goals and means.

This study examined the perceptions of building <b>administrators</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> office administration about building-based professional development, specifically Assessment FOR Learning. The National Staff Development Council standards were used as the conceptual framework for this study. Approximately 66 teachers from two different junior highs participated in the study. Participants completed a 54 -item online survey. In addition, two building principals <b>and</b> one <b>central</b> office <b>administrator</b> were interviewed. Archival data was collected on the topics and activities presented on the four building-based institute days. Overall, there were similarities between the buildings when looking at the teachers as a whole. Certain demographic variables such as years teaching, years in the district, content area taught, and experience with district-level curriculum work influenced how teachers viewed the effectiveness of their building's professional development. In the area of assessment, both buildings reported similar levels implementing Assessment FOR Learning principles in their classroom. Data collected from building <b>and</b> <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> reflected similar themes in regards to how they perceived their building's professional development. Data collected supports the importance of using standards to provide a framework for the design, implementation, and evaluation of professional development.

Analysis of diary entries and relevant Catholic Education Office documents was based on the writer's fundamental assumption that the merits of educational administrative decisions and actions should be judged in relation to the benefit these are to teachers and their students. The main conclusions of the study were: i) that the recognition by administrators of the special qualities of the personal and interpersonal relationships existing in schools would assist administrators in maintaining and developing the schools' quality; ii) that the religious faith aspect of the ideals of a Catholic school adds a deeper dimension to the special qualities of the personal and interpersonal relationships which are common to schools; iii) that such are the demands by staffs of schools for support and assistance, that the only ones who can realistically meet the bulk of such demands are staffs themselves, supporting and assisting each other through some form of regular collegial system; iv) that schools are more non-rational than rational organizations, and hence an emphasis on bureaucratic administrative processes will be detrimental to schools' effectiveness...|$|R

To overcome this situation, both local <b>and</b> <b>central</b> <b>administrators</b> who make urban policies and city planners have tended to optimize Land Use and Transportation Interaction (LU&T). In recent years, some new concepts concerning urban planning have suggested that shaping travel demands {{can be used as a}} tool to overcome these problems. The most common objectives of this concept are to reduce motorized trips and to promote public transit in metropolitan areas. To achieve these objectives, understanding the probable effects of land use on mode choice is crucial. However, the effects of land use on mode choice have never been answered fully, in Turkey. This dissertation empirically explores the relationship between travel mode choice and land use by employing different mode choice models for home - based work (HBW) trips in Istanbul at aggregate and disaggregate levels. The focus of this study is to understand how land use characteristics affect home - based work mode choice in the case of Istanbul. In this study, logit models and Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) are used to identify and quantify the effects of land use on travel mode choice at both levels. Empirical data were obtained from 2006 Household Travel Survey prepared for 2007 Istanbul Transportation Master Plan Study. The model results show that land use variables are statistically significant at both levels. The inclusion of land use variables increases models' explanatory level...|$|R

The study found that teaching is declining to a subordinate position to research. ^ The survey results reveal that the academics at Beijing University think that there should be an appropriate balance between research and undergraduate teaching, but in reality, such an ideal balance does not exist in their university. Instead, there is a clear tendency in the university culture that emphasizes research over teaching. ^ In comparison with the Syracuse study results, this research-oriented trend in Beijing University has not developed as far as the American research universities, but the study clearly indicated that the university is moving further in this direction. ...|$|R
