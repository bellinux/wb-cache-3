40|$|The Australian freight task is {{expanding}} rapidly {{and is expected}} to double in the next twenty years (BTRE 2002). The relative share of freight between road, rail and sea has seen a signi. cant change over the past twenty years, raising concerns related to environmental impacts including air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. Modal energy comparisons should re. ect the door to door task. A complete freight task will involve more than one mode in many cases, particularly due to presence of <b>road</b> <b>legs</b> for pickup and delivery. The characteristics that are considered for a comprehensive understanding of energy consumption across the entire freight task are highlighted in Figure 1. Recent attempts to compare freight modal energy demand, such as ATC (1991), IFEU and SGKV (2002) and Affleck (2002), lack an analytical energy accounting framework necessary to thoroughly understand and describe the complete freight task’s energy consumption on various Australian corridors...|$|R
