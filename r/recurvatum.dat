The practitioner stabilizes the distal thigh {{with one hand while}} lifting the great toe with the other. The injured side is compared to the healthy one and a positive test is indicated by an increased amount of <b>recurvatum,</b> or hyperextension, in the affected knee. Increased <b>recurvatum</b> indicates possible combined injuries to the posterolateral corner and cruciate ligaments. The increase on <b>recurvatum</b> is best reported as the heel height off the examining table.|$|E

50|$|Delphinium <b>recurvatum</b> is {{a species}} of {{larkspur}} known by the common names Byron larkspur, recurved larkspur, and valley larkspur. It is endemic to California, where most of its historical range is in the Central Valley. The grasslands of the valley have been mostly claimed for development and agriculture, so this species is now uncommon. This wildflower reaches a maximum height of about half a meter. Its deeply lobed leaves are mainly basal, with those located further up the dark purple stem being much smaller. The flowers are generally blue, with the sepals and lower petals darker than the upper petals. The sepals are usually curved back, the trait which gives the plant its name.|$|E

40|$|Genu <b>recurvatum</b> is an {{uncommon}} condition in children. Occasionally, it may {{occur as a}} late complication of femoral shaft fracture. There are studies that describe the possibility of genu <b>recurvatum</b> occurrence due to the tibial pin traction and without tibial tuberosity pinning.

Our case of genu <b>recurvatum</b> occurrence in an 8 -year-old girl with femoral shaft fracture 3 years after trauma confirms {{the importance of this}} complication. We believe that the etiology of tibial physeal closure and genu <b>recurvatum</b> after femoral fracture in children is unclear.

40|$|Genu <b>recurvatum</b> is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which the knee curves baac kwar d past the normal range of extension predominantly in the sagittal plane. Hyperextension {{can be attributed to}} extra laxity in the body, therefore the surrounding ligaments of the knee allow for the femur and tibia to be placed past a sagittal alignment of 180 °, which is the possible knee extension of normal knee alignment. Genu <b>recurvatum,</b> medically viewed as a deformity, is desirable and considered a positive attribute in the dance world, especially classical ballet. Hyperextension also makes the line of the leg appear longer and straighter in ballet positions. Classical ballet requires beauty in form and values length; therefore hyperextension enhances ballet 2 ̆ 7 s visual appeal. As aesthetically pleasing and desirable genu <b>recurvatum</b> is in the ballet world, it remains a structural deformity, one that has many repercussions. Genu <b>recurvatum</b> has multiple side effects that impact dance technique, body alignment, muscular development and susception to injury. As a dancer and dance educator with genu <b>recurvatum,</b> it is imperative for me to devise a comprehensive explanation of the condition regarding its effects on dance training and formulate resolutions that empower the educator to address genu <b>recurvatum</b> early in dance education. Early detection and awareness of genu <b>recurvatum</b> in dance students will result in more stable, better aligned and less injury prone dancers.

40|$|Background: Lower {{extremity}} alignment {{may influence}} the load distribution at the knee, potentially predisposing the anterior cruciate ligament to greater stress. We examined whether lower extremity alignment predicted the magnitude of anterior knee laxity in men and women. Hypothesis: Greater anterior pelvic angle, hip anteversion, tibiofemoral angle, genu <b>recurvatum,</b> and navicular drop will predict greater anterior knee laxity. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Women (n = 122) and men (n = 97) were measured for anterior knee laxity and 7 lower extremity alignment variables on their dominant stance leg. Linear regression determined {{the extent to which}} the alignment variables predicted anterior knee laxity for each sex. Results: Lower anterior pelvic tilt and tibiofemoral angle, and greater genu <b>recurvatum</b> and navicular drop were related to greater anterior knee laxity in women, explaining 28. 1 % of the variance (P <. 001). Lower anterior pelvic tilt and greater hip anteversion, genu <b>recurvatum</b> and navicular drop were predictors of greater anterior knee laxity in men, explaining 26. 5 % of the variance (P <. 001). Conclusion: Lower anterior pelvic tilt, greater knee hyperextension, and foot pronation predicted greater anterior knee laxity in both men and women, with genu <b>recurvatum</b> and navicular drop having the greatest impact on anterior knee laxity.

Case Presentation A 43 -year-old woman with a history of supracondylar extension osteotomy of the left femur at the age of 22 was admitted to our hospital for a flexion contracture of the left knee due to poliomyelitis. She was able to walk without assistance for 20 years after the osteotomy until one year ago, when she started to experience progressive genu <b>recurvatum.</b> In the clinical and laboratory workup, she was diagnosed with PPS. Accordingly, we decided to perform supracondylar flexion osteotomy.
