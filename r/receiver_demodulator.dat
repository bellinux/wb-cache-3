40|$|A {{method to}} demodulate BPSK or QPSK data using clock {{rates for the}} <b>receiver</b> <b>demodulator</b> of one-fourth the data rate is presented. This is {{accomplished}} through multirate digital signal processing techniques. The data is sampled with an analog-to-digital converter and then converted from a serial data stream to a parallel data stream. This signal processing requires a clock cycle four times the data rate. Once converted into a parallel data stream, the demodulation operations including complex baseband mixing, lowpass filtering, detection filtering, symbol-timing recovery, and carrier recovery are all accomplished at a rate one-fourth the data rate. The clock cycle required is one-sixteenth that required by a traditional serial receiver based on straight convolution. The high rate data demodulator will demodulate BPSK, QPSK, UQPSK, and DQPSK with data rates ranging from 10 Mega-symbols to more than 300 Mega-symbols per second.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here formulates the rigorous statistical {{basis for the}} correct estimation of communication link SNR of a BPSK, QPSK, and for that matter, any M-ary phase-modulated digital signal from {{what is known about}} its statistical behavior at the output of the <b>receiver</b> <b>demodulator.</b> Many methods to accomplish this have been proposed and implemented in the past but all of them are based on tacit and unwarranted assumptions and are thus defective. However, the basic idea is well founded, i. e., the signal at the output of a communications demodulator has convolved within it the prevailing SNR characteristic of the link. The acquisition of the SNR characteristic is of the utmost importance to a communications system that must remain reliable in adverse propagation conditions. This work provides a correct and consistent mathematical basis for the proper statistical 'deconvolution' of the output of a demodulator to yield a measure of the SNR. The use of such techniques will alleviate the need and expense for a separate propagation link to assess the propagation conditions prevailing on the communications link.

It is a subsequent model of BHU- 2 D, which is also developed by the same group. In this paper, the improvements of BHU- 2 D-U over BHU- 2 D are introduced. Firstly, BHU- 2 D-U is used for whole body scan, which is different from BHU- 2 D. Thus, {{the field of view}} (FOV) of the new imager is enlarged and a new antenna array type is adopted. Secondly, the enlarged FOV requires smaller antenna spacing and compact receiver arrays. In order to reduce the volume of the <b>receivers,</b> I/Q <b>demodulators</b> operating in double side band mode are adopted because it does not need the image-reject filter, which is usually a bulky one. Thirdly, the quantity of the correlators increases because the number of receiving elements is doubled. To cope with the increase of the correlator quantity, a multiplexing technique is used in the FPGA internal layout of the correlator array unit. After a brief introduction, the system design and configuration is illustrated in detail. Finally, imaging experiments on a person with concealed weapon are conducted, by which the design and image reconstruction algorithms are verified. To conclude, initial results of BHU- 2 D-U have proved that the improvements are effective. 1...|$|R

The sampler consisted mainly of a 15 l sample container with electromagnetic and manual valves, control electronics for executing the air sampling procedures and sending the position and status information of the sampler to the ground station, batteries and transmitter. All these parts were assembled in an aluminum frame gondola with a shock absorbing system for landing on sea ice.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for high-speed wireless data communications to support consumers’ need for, among other things, real time streaming of high definition video and fast file transfers. One radio architecture that has a potential to meet the increasing demand for high-speed data communications is a radio technique based on the six-port architecture. In addition to high-speed, the six-port radio also allows low power consumption and low cost. In this thesis, a comprehensive study of the six-port radio technique for high data rate (> 1 Gbit/s) and low complexity are presented. Firstly, a technique to suppress the carrier leakage was proposed, analyzed and verified by measurements. The proposed technique uses only a phase shifting network between the six-port correlator and its variable impedance loads, hence {{it is easy to}} implement. When the proposed carrier leakage suppression technique is used together with differential control signals, it also has the benefit of both improving the linearity and increasing the output power of the modulator. The same carrier leakage suppression technique can also be used in a six-port <b>demodulator</b> (<b>receiver)</b> to improve its performance. Secondly, Schottky diodes were proposed to be used as high-speed variable impedance loads. A six-port modulator operating at 7. 5 GHz, using the carrier leakage suppression technique together with Schottky diodes as variable impedance loads, was manufactured. Measurements on a 16 quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signal with a symbol rate of 300 Msymbol/s, i. e., a data rate of 1. 2 Gbit/s, have proved high-speed operation, good modulation properties as well as carrier leakage suppression. Thirdly, a six-port demodulator was built for high data rate applications and measurements were conducted to characterize its performance. Demodulation of a 16 -QAM signal at a data rate of 1. 67 Gbit/s results in an acceptable bit error rate and error vector magnitude (EVM) performance. Last but not least, new diode configurations were proposed, analyzed and verified for use in six-port demodulators. Using the proposed diode configurations, the use of differential amplifiers, as commonly used in a six-port demodulator, can be avoided. Avoiding the use of differential amplifiers allows high-speed processing {{and at the same time}} reduces the power consumption and implementation complexity. In the context of the new diode configurations, it was shown that a six-port receiver has better EVM vs frequency performance and lower implementation complexity, compared to a five-port or four-port receiver...|$|R
