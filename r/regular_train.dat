5|$|The first {{plans for}} a line through Numedal were {{launched}} after the Sørland Line reached in Kongsberg in 1871. After {{it was decided that}} the Bergen Line would instead follow Hallingdal, the Numedal plans lay dead until it was decided that a railway was necessary to build two hydroelectric power stations near Rødberg. The plans were passed in 1918, the first trains started running in 1924 and the line was officially opened in 1927. At first all services were provided with steam locomotives, but from the 1930s diesel multiple units were used for passenger trains. The line was frequented with classes Cmd 16, 86, 87 and 91. The last <b>regular</b> <b>train</b> ran in 1988; since, there has been sporadic freight service and some heritage trains running from Kongsberg to Rollag. Draisine rental is available on the section from Veggli to Rødberg.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: <b>Regular</b> <b>training</b> is {{suggested}} {{to offer a}} host of benefits especially on cardiovascular system. In addition, medicinal plants can attenuate oxidative stress-mediated damages induced by stressor insults. In this study, we investigated the concomitant effect of cinnamon extract and long-term aerobic training on cardiac function, biochemical alterations and lipid profile following exhaustive exercise. Methods: Male Wistar rats (250 - 300 g) were divided into five groups depending on receiving <b>regular</b> <b>training,</b> cinnamon bark extraction, none or both of them, and then encountered with an exhausted exercise in last session. An 8 -week endurance training program was designed with a progressive increase in training speed and time. Myocardial hemodynamics was monitored using a balloon-tipped catheter inserted into left ventricles. Blood samples were collected for analyzing biochemical markers, lipid profiles and lipid-peroxidation marker, malondealdehyde (MDA). Results: Trained animals showed an enhanced cardiac force and contractility similar to cinnamon-treated rats. Co-application of <b>regular</b> <b>training</b> and cinnamon had additive effect in cardiac hemodynamic (P< 0. 05). Both <b>regular</b> <b>training</b> and supplementation with cinnamon significantly decreased serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level and HDL/LDL ratio as compared to control group (P< 0. 01). Furthermore, pre-treatment with cinnamon extract and/or <b>regular</b> <b>training</b> significantly reduced MDA level elevation induced by exhausted exercise (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: Long-term treatment of rats with cinnamon and <b>regular</b> <b>training</b> improved cardiac hemodynamic through an additive effect. The positive effects of cinnamon and <b>regular</b> <b>training</b> on cardiac function were associated with a reduced serum MDA level and an improved blood lipid profile...|$|R
25|$|Double-stacked rail transport, where {{containers}} {{are stacked}} two high on railway cars, {{was introduced in}} the United States. The concept was developed by Sea-Land and the Southern Pacific railroad. The first standalone double-stack container car (or single-unit 40-ft COFC well car) was delivered in July 1977. The 5-unit well car, the industry standard, appeared {{for the first time in}} 1981. Initially, these double-stack railway cars were deployed in <b>regular</b> <b>train</b> service. Ever since American President Lines initiated in 1984 a dedicated double-stack container train service between Los Angeles and Chicago, transport volumes increased rapidly.|$|E
25|$|After the Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War, {{reconstruction}} of the tram system began. The old and outdated tram wagons required restoration as the industry of the country could not manufacture new wagons. The train wagons' reconstruction {{was carried out in}} the main tram depot of the system, the Dombal Depot. From 1928-1932, 80 two-axel motor tram wagons and 65 <b>regular</b> <b>train</b> wagons were manufactured for Kiev, and since 1932, the depot started producing four-axel tram wagons, due to Kiev's geographical relief and climate. On the tram wagons, the conductors place was not warmed during the winter, however, was separated from the passenger part of the wagon.|$|E
25|$|The main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, {{near the}} center of the city, has 12million {{passengers}} a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A <b>regular</b> <b>train</b> service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, Périgueux, Langon, Pau, Le Médoc, Angoulême and Bayonne.|$|E

25|$|Aldwych tube station, {{formerly}} on {{a branch}} of the Piccadilly line, has been used as the location for many films and television productions, especially since the branch and station closed in 1994 and the platforms have been left intact making it suitable for filming and photography purposes, due to the absence of a <b>regular</b> <b>train</b> service. A 1970s tube train permanently is based at the station and heritage rolling stock can be brought in for filming - London Underground have retained one of their 1938 trains which can be used for historic appearances. In more recent years filming has also taken place at the former Jubilee line platforms at Charing Cross station, which were withdrawn from regular use when the line was extended in 1999 avoiding the station.|$|E
25|$|Electrification {{was carried}} out in several smaller steps, with the first part from Oslo Ø to Ljan {{completed}} on 9 December 1936 and the last section from Sarpsborg to Halden, on 11 November 1940. NSB Class 66 was introduced as an express servie on the Østfold Line, running a round trip from Oslo to Halden each day, bringing travel time down to two hours. This lasted until 1956, when they were replaced with the slower NSB Class 65. The international trains were from 1948 served with the Swedish State Railways' SJ X5 units, able to run from Oslo to Copenhagen in less than ten hours. The fast service was named Skandiapilen. A landslide in 1953 washed away part of the track past Bekkelaget, resulting in the Bekkelaget Tunnel opening there five years later. The regional traffic received the new NSB Class 68 multiple units from the mid 1950s. A <b>regular</b> <b>train</b> with pyrite started running in 1966, hauling up to 600,000 tonnes per year from Hjerkinn on the Dovre Line to Borregaard. They remained until the 1990s.|$|E

500|$|The {{preservation}} {{society had}} long held ambitions {{to extend the}} railway along the former mineral extension from Abergynolwyn {{to the foot of}} the Alltwyllt incline, and as early as 1959 work had begun to trace the owners of the land that the extension traversed. Planning began in the mid-1960s, but construction did not start until 1968 when the winding house for the Abergynolwyn village incline was demolished. To bring the line up to passenger standards some of the curves needed to be eased, and this required blasting work, as the line runs on a narrow ledge on the hillside at this point. The extension and new station at Nant Gwernol were opened on 22 May 1976 by Wynford Vaughan Thomas who drove in the ceremonial [...] "golden spike" [...] to complete the extension. Despite this official opening ceremony, minor work still remained to bring the extension to the standard required to run regular passenger trains, but <b>regular</b> <b>train</b> services began on 29 May 1976.|$|E
