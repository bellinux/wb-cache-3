50|$|Unclonability {{means that}} each PUF device {{has a unique}} and {{unpredictable}} way of mapping challenges to responses, {{even if it was}} manufactured with the same process as a similar device, and it is infeasible to construct a PUF with the same challenge-response behavior as another given PUF because exact control over the manufacturing process is infeasible. Mathematical unclonability means that it should be very hard to compute an unknown response given the other CRPs or some of the properties of the <b>random</b> <b>components</b> from a PUF. This is because a response is created by a complex interaction of the challenge with many or all of the <b>random</b> <b>components.</b> In other words, given the design of the PUF system, without knowing all of the physical properties of the <b>random</b> <b>components,</b> the CRPs are highly unpredictable.

40|$|In {{circular}} {{particle accelerators}} {{it is very}} important to minimize field errors in the magnets. These errors, that can be both systematic and random, can lead to a reduction of the dynamic aperture. In particular, systematic multipolar components arise from pole shaping, which usually differs from the ideal one, while <b>random</b> <b>components</b> come from mechanical tolerances and magnet assembly. In this note we deal with the effects of random field errors on the dynamic aperture of the DAΦNE main rings. Being very difficult to correlate these errors to their mechanical origins, we use experimental data from other machines in operation or construction (PEP, AGS, ALS) to estimate the magnitude of <b>random</b> <b>components</b> in our simulations. In the first part of this note we briefly describe the mechanical tolerances which are the source of random errors. In the second part we estimate the magnitude of the errors to be used in the tracking code. Finally we compare the dynamic apertures obtained with and without <b>random</b> <b>components...</b>|$|R

50|$|If we {{consider}} an inert species (no reaction) with no sources and assume molecular diffusion to be negligible, only the advection terms {{on the left}} hand {{side of the equation}} survive. The solution to this model seems trivial at first, however we have ignored the <b>random</b> <b>component</b> of the velocity plus the average velocity in uj= ū + uj’ that is typically associated with turbulent behavior. In turn, the concentration solution for the Eulerian model must also have a <b>random</b> <b>component</b> cj= c+ cj’.

40|$|We {{propose a}} class of semiparametric {{functional}} regression models to describe the influence of vector-valued covariates on a sample of response curves. Each observed curve is viewed as the realization of a random process, composed of an overall mean function and <b>random</b> <b>components.</b> The finite dimensional covariates influence the <b>random</b> <b>components</b> of the eigenfunction expansion through single-index models that include unknown smooth link and variance functions. The parametric components of the single-index models are estimated via quasi-score estimating equations with link and variance functions being estimated nonparametrically. We obtain several basic asymptotic results. The functional regression models proposed are illustrated with the analysis of a data set consisting of egg laying curves for 1000 female Mediterranean fruit-flies (medflies).

40|$|<b>Random</b> <b>components</b> {{of field}} {{harmonics}} in superconducting quadrupoles are usually estimated by computing {{the effect of}} a random positioning of the coil blocks with an r. m. s. of 0. 05 mm.

Post-processed data show that the reproducibility is around 0. 020 mm r. m. s., and independent of the aperture.

40|$|Generalized Linear Models extends {{classical}} {{regression models}} to non-normal response vari-ables and allows a non-linear {{relation between the}} mean of the responses and the predictors. In addition, when the responses are correlated or show overdispersion, one can add a linear combina-tion of <b>random</b> <b>components</b> to the linear predictor. The resulting models are known as Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Traditional estimation methods in these classes of models rely on distrib-utional assumptions about the <b>random</b> <b>components,</b> as well as the implicit assumption that the explanatory variables are uncorrelated with the error term. In Chapters 2 and 3 we investigate, using the Change-of-Variance Function, the behavior of the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of the class of M-estimators when the distribution of the <b>random</b> <b>components</b> is slightly contam-inated. In Chapter 4 we study a different concept of robustness for classical models that contain explanatory variables correlated with the error term. For these models we propose an instrumental variables estimator and study its robustness by means of its Influence Function. We extend the definitions of Change-of-Variance Function to Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Linear Mixed Models. We use them to analyze in detail the sensitivity of the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator. For the first class of models, we foun...|$|R
