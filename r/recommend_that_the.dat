Proposition P passed with the support of 79percent of San Francisco voters on November 5, 1991.|$|E

5|$|In a 2012 {{review of}} {{pinniped}} taxonomy, Berta and Morgan Churchill suggested that, based on morphological and genetic criteria, there are 33 extant species and 29 subspecies of pinnipeds, although {{five of the}} latter lack sufficient support to be conclusively considered subspecies. They <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genus Arctocephalus be limited to Arctocephalus pusillus, and they resurrected the name Arctophoca for several species and subspecies formerly placed in Arctocephalus. More than 50 fossil species have been described.|$|E

5|$|Stieger, Voracek, and Formann <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> task be {{administered}} twice, {{that the effects}} be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness. They suggest {{it may be useful}} to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation. The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as depression, physical health, social acceptance, unrealistic optimism, feedback sensitivity, self-regulation, and defensiveness.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Swift, then Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, {{was already}} {{known for his}} concern for the Irish people and for writing several {{political}} pamphlets. One of these, Proposal for the Universal use of Irish Manufacture (1720), had so inflamed the British authorities that the printer, John Harding, was prosecuted, although the pamphlet had done little more than <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Irish use the materials they produce rather than export them to England. It was also known by the Irish authorities that Swift's political pamphleteering had been employed by the Tory government of Queen Anne, {{and that he would}} use his abilities to undermine the Whig government of Walpole.|$|E
5|$|Rorquals {{consist of}} two genera (Balaenoptera and Megaptera) and nine species: the fin whale (B. physalus), the Sei whale (B. borealis), Bryde's whale (B. brydei), Eden's whale (B. edeni), the blue whale (B. musculus), the common minke whale (B. acutorostrata), the Antarctic minke whale (B. bonaerensis), Omura's whale (B. omurai), and the {{humpback}} whale (M. novaeangliae). In a 2012 review of cetacean taxonomy, Alexandre Hassanin (of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle) and colleagues suggested that, based on phylogenic criteria, {{there are four}} extant genera of rorquals. They <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genus Balaenoptera {{be limited to the}} fin whale, have minke whales fall under the genus Pterobalaena, and have Rorqualus contain the Sei whale, Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, the blue whale, and Omura's whale.|$|E
5000|$|ICAC {{found no}} {{evidence}} of corruption, but <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NSW Government improve its guidelines on dealing with lobbyists. It also <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Government adopt better protocols for ministers and their staff for dealing with allegations of corruption in relation to external parties. It noted that current guidelines were based on public service guidelines, and instructed ministerial staff to [...] "report unethical behaviour or suspected corrupt to senior management", without explaining who [...] "senior management" [...] were. Finally, it <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Government finalise State Environmental Planning Policy 66 - Integration of Land Use and Transport.|$|R

5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> decision to treat a person with FH with statins should not {{be based on the}} usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E
5|$|Guest was Minister of Mines and Public Works, from 1 June 1938 to 1 February 1944. The Electricity Supply Commission {{came under}} his portfolio. It had {{responsibility}} for {{ensuring that the}} generation of electricity kept pace with the ever·growing needs of mining, farming and secondary industry. When Guest became Minister the Commission was constructing a thermal power station at Umsweswe, but kept running short of money. The Minister of Finance, Jacob Smit, was reluctant to grant further funds but would support a hydro-electric scheme. Guest proposed Kariba {{as a source of}} hydro-electric power and Smit provided the money for further investigation. Guest arranged with a civil engineer named Jeffares, who had earlier surveyed the route of the proposed Sinoia/Kafue railway and knew the country around Kariba, to survey the area, select a site for a power station and submit a report. When he eventually did so, Guest appointed a committee of engineers to examine the proposal. They reported favourably but did not <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scheme be proceeded with immediately. Nor was the Cabinet particularly impressed, and the idea was strongly criticised by the Opposition in Parliament. The outbreak of the Second World War caused the project to be shelved but after the war the project was revived as a joint scheme to serve the two Rhodesias.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, at the {{direction}} of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal opened an inquiry into thirteen cases of unresolved recognition for past acts of gallantry. Among the group were eleven naval personnel, including Sheean. Known as the 'Valour Inquiry', the Tribunal was directed to determine if the individuals were unduly overlooked for recognition {{at the time of their}} actions and, if so, whether retrospective awards were appropriate. The inquiry lasted two years and witnessed 166 written submissions from the public, before the Tribunal reported its findings in January 2013. In the case of Sheean, the Tribunal found that there was no manifest injustice with the award of the Mention in Despatches, and that there was no new evidence to support the reconsideration of Sheean for a Victoria Cross for Australia. If Sheean had lived, they reported, he might have been recommended for either the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal or the Distinguished Service Medal instead, but neither medal could be awarded posthumously in 1942. The Tribunal did <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> RAN perpetuate the use of Sheean as the name of a major combatant vessel.|$|E

Under the Illinois Constitution, Fitzgerald rather than Senate President John Cullerton, presided because the accused was the governor.|$|E
