5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which {{are caught in}} the air by flights from an open perch. The stinger is removed by repeatedly hitting and <b>rubbing</b> <b>the</b> insect on a hard surface. During this process, pressure is applied to the insect, thereby extracting most of the venom.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, <b>rubbing</b> <b>the</b> fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} {{treatment}} for a Myrmecia sting depends on {{the severity of the}} reaction. If no signs of an allergic reaction are seen, an ice pack or commercially available spray is used to relieve the pain. Washing the stung area, stingose, and the use of antihistamine tablets are other methods to reduce the pain. Indigenous Australians use bush remedies to treat Myrmecia stings, such as <b>rubbing</b> <b>the</b> tips of bracken ferns onto the stung area. Carpobrotus glaucescens is also used to treat stung areas, using juices that are squeezed and rubbed onto the area, which quickly relieves the pain from the sting.|$|E
5|$|The book's current {{dimensions}} are 330 by 250mm. Originally, the folios were of no standard size, {{but they were}} cropped to the current size during a 19th-century rebinding. The text area is approximately 250 by 170mm. Each text page has 16 to 18 lines of text. The manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its great age, though many pages have suffered some damage to the delicate artwork due to <b>rubbing.</b> <b>The</b> book {{must have been the}} product of a major scriptorium over several years, yet was apparently never finished, the projected decoration of some pages appearing only in outline. It is believed that some 30 folios of the original manuscript have been lost over the centuries. Ussher counted 344 folios in 1621, but several leaves had already been lost by then. The overall estimate is based on gaps in the text and the absence of certain key illustrations.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids {{lack the}} {{elaborate}} breeding dances of the albatrosses, {{in no small}} part due to the tendency of most of them to attend colonies at night and breed in burrows, where visual displays are useless. The fulmarine petrels, which nest on the surface and attend their colonies diurnally, do use a repertoire of stereotyped behaviours such as cackling, preening, head waving and nibbling, but for most species courtship interactions are limited to some billing (<b>rubbing</b> <b>the</b> two bills together) in the burrow and the vocalisations made by all species. The calls serve a number of functions: they are used territorially to protect burrows or territories and to call for mates. Each call type is unique to a particular species and indeed it is possible for procellariids to identify the sex of the bird calling as well. It may also be possible to assess the quality of potential mates; a study of blue petrels found a link between the rhythm and duration of calls and the body mass of the bird. The ability of an individual to recognise its mate has also been demonstrated in several species.|$|E

30|$|<b>Rubbing</b> {{fastness}} of <b>the</b> dyed samples {{was determined}} using automatic Crockmeter. The method adopted is from ISO 105 X 12 evaluation procedure [22]. Both dry rubbing and wet <b>rubbing</b> of <b>the</b> dyed fabric were assessed. Suitable testing device {{for determining the}} colour fastness to rubbing consists of a reciprocating straight line rubbing motion and a <b>rubbing</b> finger. <b>The</b> <b>rubbing</b> finger shall exert a downward force of 9  ±  0.2  N moving to and fro 20 times, 10 times in each direction {{in a straight line}} along a path of 10  ±  3  cm track. A bleached white fabric is attached to <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> finger and is <b>rubbed</b> against <b>the</b> dyed sample. While assessing wet <b>rubbing</b> fastness, <b>the</b> fabric is moistened with water and then <b>rubbed.</b> <b>The</b> staining of <b>the</b> cotton <b>rubbing</b> cloths is assessed with the grey scale for staining.|$|R

25|$|Some tribal {{cultures}} traditionally created tattoos {{by cutting}} designs {{into the skin}} and <b>rubbing</b> <b>the</b> resulting wound with ink, ashes or other agents; some cultures continue this practice, which may be an adjunct to scarification.

Anaphylactic reactions occur {{most often in}} sensitive patients who {{have been exposed to}} a surgeon's latex gloves during abdominal surgery, but other mucosal exposures, such as dental procedures, can also produce systemic reactions.|$|E
