5000|$|A {{secondary}} inferiority feeling {{relates to}} an adult's {{experience of being}} unable to reach a subconscious, reassuring fictional final goal of subjective security and success {{to compensate for the}} inferiority feelings. The perceived distance from that reassuring goal would lead to a negative/depressed feeling that could then prompt the recall <b>of</b> the original <b>inferiority</b> feeling; this composite <b>of</b> <b>inferiority</b> feelings could be experienced as overwhelming. The reassuring goal invented to relieve the original, primary feeling <b>of</b> <b>inferiority</b> which actually causes the secondary feeling <b>of</b> <b>inferiority</b> is the [...] "catch-22" [...] of this dilemma, where the desperate attempt to obtain therapeutic reassurance and delivery from a depressing feeling <b>of</b> <b>inferiority</b> and worthlessness repeatedly fails. This vicious cycle is common in neurotic lifestyles.|$|R

5000|$|The {{doctrine}}s of Petrine primacy and papal primacy {{are perhaps the}} most contentiously disputed in the history of Christianity. Theologians regard the doctrine of papal primacy as having developed gradually in the West due to the convergence of a number of factors, e.g., the dignity of Rome as the only apostolic see in the West; the tradition that both Peter and Paul had been martyred there; Rome's long history as a capital of the Roman Empire; and its continuing position as the chief center of commerce and communication. The doctrine of the primacy of the Roman Bishops, like other Catholic Church teachings and instructions, has gone through a development. Thus the establishment of the Primacy recorded in the Gospels has been gradually more clearly recognized and its implications developed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the association of introspection into the future with a feeling <b>of</b> <b>inferiority</b> and to consider how these two constructs could be used in clinical psychology practice. It is believed that it is possible to develop a more objective point of view during adolescence because of the self-concept development and time perspective that occurs during this period. The study revealed that frequent introspection and resistance to accepting negative aspects of oneself increase one’s feelings <b>of</b> <b>inferiority,</b> and having a positive outlook for the future weakens such feelings. These findings suggest that in-depth self-reflection and a positive future outlook are needed to weaken the feeling <b>of</b> <b>inferiority.</b> The findings can be used to understand the client’s perspective during student counseling and can aid in the prevention of workplace depression...|$|R

40|$|For racial {{minority}} faculty, racism {{is associated with}} adverse outcomes, including poor job satisfaction and less motivation, which may lead faculty to leave the teaching profession. It is unknown what relationships, if any, exist among perceived racial microaggression, job satisfaction, and employee motivation among African American (AA) faculty and other faculty of color {{in colleges and universities}} in the southeastern United States. Critical race theory provided a framework to investigate the <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> perceived racial microaggressions toward AA faculty and other faculty of color with motivation and job satisfaction. This study involved a correlational design using multiple linear regressions to determine the relationships between the variables in a sample of 42 AA faculty and other faculty of color. In the multiple linear regression analysis, the predictor variables were 6 microaggression subscales (assumptions <b>of</b> <b>inferiority,</b> second-class citizen and assumption of criminality, microinvalidations, exoticization/assumptions of similarity, environmental microaggressions, and workplace and school micro-aggressions). The outcome variables were employee motivation and job satisfaction. The results of the analysis indicated no significant relationships between perceived level of microaggressions and job satisfaction or between perceived level of microaggressions and employee motivation. To determine possible bivariate relationships, Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlations were performed. Assumptions <b>of</b> <b>inferiority</b> and microinvalidations were negatively correlated with job satisfaction, which suggests that when examined in isolation, higher assumptions <b>of</b> <b>inferiority</b> and microinvalidations were associated with lower levels of job satisfaction. Implications for positive social change pertain to ways that oppression and racism can be eliminated in colleges and universities...|$|R

40|$|Individuals {{sometimes}} have an inferiority feeling in human relationships and compensative action often accompanies inferiority feelings. In Study Ⅰ, an Inferiority Feeling Scale was developed, and {{reliability and validity}} were established. The 272 subjects were divided into high (n= 90), middle (n= 92), and low (n= 90) groups by score. From the relation with “Individual and Social PN Orientedness Scale,”a strong inferiority feeling {{was related to the}} internal and interpersonal maladjustments, the lack of one implied egoism. Moreover, the author composed“A Scale <b>of</b> <b>Inferiority</b> Response Characteristics,”and a factor analysis revealed 5 factors: effort orientation, defensive reaction, substitute behavior, resistance to display inferiority feelings, and denial <b>of</b> <b>inferiority</b> feelings. Subjects with strong inferiority feelings were more defensive and adopted less substitute behavior than those without inferiority feelings. In StudyⅡ, research using Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) suggested that high-score inferior feeling group(n= 10) tended to assume internal struggles as a cause of negative self-image, to compensate for inferiority with imagination, and to be more dependent. In conclusion, individualization is no less important than socialization in the study <b>of</b> <b>inferiority</b> feelings and the characteristics <b>of</b> response to <b>inferiority</b> feelings differs between subjects who have a strong inferiority feeling and those who don’t...|$|R

A lack of power often lies at the root <b>of</b> feelings <b>of</b> <b>inferiority.</b> One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings <b>of</b> <b>inferiority.</b>|$|R
