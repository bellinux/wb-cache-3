40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{identify}} the correlates of educational differences in smoking among adults. We used data from the baseline of a Dutch longitudinal study, relating to a population of 2, 462 respondents, ages 25 - 74. Logistic regression {{was used to assess}} the educational gradient in smoking. Current smokers were compared with former and never smokers, respectively. The risk of being a current smoker compared with being a former/never smoker was higher among lower educational groups. For example, the odds of being a current smoker compared with never smoker among persons in the lowest level was more than five times as high as that for persons in the highest level. A substantial part (20 - 40 %) of the increased risk of being a smoker among lower groups appeared to be associated with adverse material conditions. The financial situation especially accounted for that effect. One of the cultural factors, i. e., locus of control, was found to account for approximately 30 % of the educational gradient in the case in which smokers were compared with former smokers. Psychosocial factors, i. e., neuroticism and coping styles, accounted for less of the gradient in smoking than cultural and material factors. On the basis of the results, we hypothesize that both cultural and material factors contribute to the higher smoking rates among lower socioeconomic groups. Psychosocial factors seem to be less important. If our results are confirmed in more powerful studies, this would indicate, first, that possibilities for a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoking</b> differences may be found in tailoring smoking cessation programs to the more externally oriented locus of control and the coping styles that are common among lower educational groups, and second, that a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoking</b> differences may follow from an improvement of the material living conditions of lower socioeconomic group...|$|E

Cigarette use, frequency-domain parameters of HRV (low frequency [LF], high frequency [HF], LF/HF ratio), and physiological sexual arousal responses (via penile plethysmography) were assessed at each visit. Results were consistent with mediation, in that greater reductions in cigarette use from baseline to follow-up were associated with longitudinal increases in LF, which in turn showed positive relations with across-time changes in erectile tumescence.

40|$|Using Japan’s prefecture-level panel {{data from}} 1989 - 2001, this paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} the social norm on a person’s smoking behavior when the complementary relationship between smoking and drinking is taken into account. The key findings through a dynamic panel model controlling for unobserved prefecture-specific fixed effects are as follows: (1) Influence from others is stronger when people live more closely and cohesively. A tightly knit society results in a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoking</b> through smoking-related interaction. (2) Smoking and drinking have a complementary relationship, and it is stronger when the consumption of alcohol is greater at the start. (3) The complementary relationship between smoking and dinking is attenuated if the cost of committing the annoying conduct (i. e., smoking) is high. Overall, this empirical study provides evidence that the psychological effect of the presence of surrounding people has a direct significant effect upon smoking behavior and, further, that it attenuates the complementary relationship between smoking and drinking, thereby reducing cigarette consumption. These results indicate that not only formal rules but also tacitly formed informal norms are effective deterrents to smoking. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background While Italy has {{implemented}} some {{tobacco control}} policies {{over the last}} few decades, which resulted in a decreased smoking prevalence, there is still considerable scope to strengthen tobacco control policies consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) policy guidelines. The present study aims to evaluate the effect of past and project the effect of future tobacco control policies on smoking prevalence and associated premature mortality in Italy. Methods To assess, individually and in combination, the effect of seven types of policies, we used the SimSmoke simulation model of tobacco control policy. The model uses population, smoking rates and tobacco control policy data for Italy. Results Significant <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoking</b> prevalence and premature mortality can be achieved through tobacco price increases, high intensity media campaigns, comprehensive cessation treatment program, strong health warnings, stricter smoke-free air regulations and advertising bans, and youth access laws. With a comprehensive approach, the smoking prevalence can be decreased by as much as 12 % soon after the policies are in place, increasing to a 30 % reduction in the next twenty years and a 34 % reduction by 30 [*]years in 2040. Without effective tobacco control policies, a total of almost 300 thousand lives will be prematurely lost due to smoking by the year 2040. Conclusion Besides presenting the benefits of a comprehensive tobacco control strategy, the model helps identify information gaps in surveillance and evaluation schemes that will promote the effectiveness of future tobacco control policy in Italy. </p...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to describe WHO MPOWER policy measures in thirteen West-African countries and to investigate their correlation with smoking prevalence. Methods: Age-standardized smoking prevalence data and policy measures were collected from various WHO reports. For analysis MPOWER measures from 2008 and 2010, were combined with prevalence data from 2009 and 2011. Multiple linear regression models were set up. Results: In West-Africa mean smoking prevalence was approximately 20  % among males and approximately 3  % among females. Policy measures were mostly at a middle or low level. Regression analysis showed that tobacco cessation programs, health warnings on cigarettes, and higher price of cigarettes were negatively correlated with smoking prevalence. Significant effects were observed for only one policy measure (tobacco cessation programs) and only within the male population where smoking prevalence is generally higher. Conclusions: Tobacco control policies are enforced at relatively low levels in West-African countries. However, improving tobacco control policy implementation according to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control should assist in the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoking</b> prevalence in African countries, thereby counteracting pro-smoking initiatives set forth by the tobacco industry...|$|E

Upon the completion of our pilot study, we will investigate the combined effects of delivering self-help SMS text messages with candidates that rate 3 ̆c 8 on the Contemplation Ladder (intention to quit scale) in natural-based setting. Method: A sample of (N= 60) adult smokers from the Eugene Community intending to quit will come in our lab for two sessions (baseline and follow-up) where physiological tests and selfreports will be measured. Smokers will be allocated {{to one of three}} condition groups where they will be sent 6 text messages per day for four weeks. Hypothesized Results: Our results showed significant positive outcomes. In addition, over forty participants from the self-generated group reported a drastic <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> cigarette <b>smoking</b> than the control group. Subjects from the self-generated with implementation intention condition reported a slight increase in self -efficacy over participants in the self-generated condition. Discussion: This findings demonstrate the efficacy of sms- text messaging in a smoking cessation intervention conducted under natural-based settings...|$|R
