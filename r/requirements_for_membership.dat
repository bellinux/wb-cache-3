5|$|The Order {{was open}} to men and women, and both genders were {{entitled}} companions. Until 1476, there were no limits {{on the number of}} companions to be admitted, but that year, with the new edition of the Order's statutes, the Duke limited the number of men to 60; unlimited women could be admitted. The editions of the Order's statutes, two in Latin and two in German, established similar <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership.</b> The Latin editions stipulated that the man be of noble birth—eight generations of noble grandparents—and of unblemished reputation; the German versions required that only four grandparents of the man be noble. Women were to be spouses of a companion; in the 1476 versions of the statutes, both Latin and German, female members of the Duchess' household could be admitted even if their husbands were not members or if the women were single, but were required to resign if they left the service of the Duchess. The exception to this clause provided for their continued membership if their husbands became companions of the order.|$|E

25|$|These {{criteria}} were unenforceable for two decades, until, in 1991, the Harare Declaration was issued, dedicating the leaders to applying the Singapore principles to {{the completion of}} decolonisation, {{the end of the}} Cold War, and the end of apartheid in South Africa. The mechanisms by which these principles would be applied were created, and the manner clarified, by the 1995 Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme, which created the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), which has the power to rule on whether members meet the <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership</b> under the Harare Declaration. Also in 1995, an Inter-Governmental Group was created to finalise and codify the full <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership.</b> Upon reporting in 1997, as adopted under the Edinburgh Declaration, the Inter-Governmental Group ruled that any future members would have to have a direct constitutional link with an existing member.|$|E

25|$|As {{political}} entities, tribes {{have established}} their own <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership,</b> {{often based on}} at least one of a person's ancestors having been included on tribal-specific Native American censuses (or final rolls) prepared during treaty-making, relocation to reservations or apportionment of land in the late 19th century and early 20th century. One example is the Dawes Rolls. Tribes are political constructs, not genetic populations.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Black Institution {{was formed}} {{out of the}} Orange Order {{two years after the}} {{founding}} of the parent body. Although it is a separate organisation, one of the <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership</b> in the Royal Black is membership of the Orange Order and to be no less than 17 years old. The membership is exclusively male and the Royal Black Chapter is generally considered to be more religious and respectable in its proceedings than the Orange Order.|$|E
25|$|In June 2004, Turkey's public {{television}} TRT began broadcasting a half-hour Kurdish program, and on March 8, 2006, the Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) allowed two TV channels (Gün TV and Söz TV) and one radio channel (Medya FM) to have limited {{service in the}} Kurdish language. This legislation came into force {{as an effort to}} meet one of the European Union’s <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership</b> in its talks with Turkey. The new regulation will allot five hours of weekly radio broadcast and four of television.|$|E

500|$|Whether a broad {{spectrum}} of civilizations from many places in the galaxy would even be able to cooperate is disputed by Michaud, who states that civilizations with huge differences in the technologies and resources at their command [...] "may not consider themselves even remotely equal". It is unlikely that humanity would meet the basic <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership</b> at its current low level of technological advancement. A galactic club may, William Hamilton speculates, set extremely high entrance requirements that are unlikely to be met by less advanced civilizations.|$|E
500|$|In NATO {{official}} statements, the Republic of Macedonia {{is always}} {{referred to as}} the [...] "former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", with a footnote stating that [...] "Turkey recognizes the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name". Though Macedonia completed its <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership</b> {{at the same time as}} Croatia and Albania, NATO's most recent members, its accession was blocked by Greece pending a resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute. In order to support each other in the process, new and potential members in the region formed the Adriatic Charter in 2003. Georgia was also named as an aspiring member, and was promised [...] "future membership" [...] during the 2008 summit in Bucharest, though in 2014, US President Barack Obama said the country was not [...] "currently on a path" [...] to membership.|$|E

2500|$|Under Peisistratos of Athens, the Eleusinian Mysteries became pan-Hellenic, and pilgrims flocked from Greece {{and beyond}} to participate. Around 300 BC, the state took {{over control of}} the Mysteries; they were {{controlled}} by two families, the Eumolpidae and the Kerykes. This led to a vast {{increase in the number of}} initiates. The only <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership</b> were freedom from [...] "blood guilt" [...] , meaning never having committed murder, and not being a [...] "barbarian" [...] (being unable to speak Greek). Men, women and even slaves were allowed initiation.|$|E

[...] A list of <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership</b> itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (bayat) to follow one's superiors. In his memoir, bin Laden's former bodyguard, Nasser al-Bahri, gives the only publicly available description of the ritual of giving bayat when he swore his allegiance to the al-Qaeda chief. According to Wright, the group's real name wasn't used in public pronouncements because [...] "its existence was still a closely held secret." ...|$|E

2500|$|Membership in Phi Sigma Kappa is {{available}} to male students attending a college, university, technical institute, or community college with a Phi Sigma Kappa chapter provided the man is {{not a member of}} a nationally recognized social collegiate fraternity.

2500|$|The {{organized}} tribes, {{which developed}} from kinship and geographic communities, establish their own <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership,</b> {{as well as}} what they consider its obligations. Generally, members must pay dues; attend tribal meetings (which are usually monthly in the [...] "home" [...] areas); volunteer to serve as a tribal officer when asked; help to put on tribal events; belong to the tribal church (if one exists and they are able); teach their children their people's history and pass on traditional crafts; volunteer to represent the tribe at the Virginia Council on Indians, the United Indians of Virginia, or at other tribes' powwows; speak at engagements for civic or school groups; and live in a good way, so as to best represent their tribe and Native Americans in general. Most Indian tribes maintain some traditions from before the time of European settlement, and are keen to pass these on to their children. Although Indians are also highly involved in non-native culture and employment, they regularly engage in activities for their individual tribes, including wearing regalia and attending powwows, heritage festivals, and tribal homecomings. Individuals try to maintain a balance between elements of their traditional culture and participating in the majority culture.|$|E
2500|$|Many honor {{societies}} invite {{students to}} become members based on scholastic rank (the top x% of a class) and/or grade point, either overall, or for classes taken within the discipline for which the honor society provides recognition. In cases where academic achievement {{would not be an}} appropriate criterion for membership, other standards are required for membership (such as completion of a particular ceremony or training program). These societies recognize past achievement. Pledging is not required, and new candidates may be immediately inducted into membership after meeting predetermined academic criteria and paying a one-time membership fee. Some require graduate enrollment. [...] Because of their purpose of recognition, most honor societies will have much higher academic achievement <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership</b> than professional societies. It is also common for a scholastic honor society to add a criterion relating to the character of the student. Some honor societies are invitation only while others allow unsolicited applications. Finally, membership in an honor society might be considered exclusive, i.e., a member of such an organization cannot join other honor societies representing the same field. Governance requires a faculty sponsor and each society remains faculty-guided, usually with alumni input.|$|E

60|$|Georgetown has a {{remarkable}} {{record for a}} western village. It is, and has been from its earliest existence, a democratic town. There was probably no time during the rebellion when, if the opportunity could have been afforded, {{it would not have}} voted for Jefferson Davis for President of the United States, over Mr. Lincoln, or any other representative of his party; unless it was immediately after some of John Morgan's men, in his celebrated raid through Ohio, spent a few hours in the village. The rebels helped themselves to whatever they could find, horses, boots and shoes, especially horses, and many ordered meals to be prepared for them by the families. This was no doubt a far pleasanter duty for some families {{than it would have been}} to render a like service for Union soldiers. The line between the Rebel and Union element in Georgetown was so marked that it led to divisions even in the churches. There were churches in that part of Ohio where treason was preached regularly, and where, to secure membership, hostility to the government, to the war and to the liberation of the slaves, was far more essential than a belief in the authenticity or credibility of the Bible. There were men in Georgetown who filled all the <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership</b> in these churches.|$|E
