40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the findings from}} a longitudinal research study on <b>regulatory</b> <b>technology</b> in the UK financial services industry. The financial crisis with serious corporate and mutual fund scandals raised the profile of compliance as governmental bodies, institutional and private investors introduced a ‘tsunami’ of financial regulations. Adopting a multi-level analysis, this study examines how <b>regulatory</b> <b>technology</b> was used by financial firms to meet their compliance obligations, pre- and post-crisis. Empirical data collected over 12 years examine the deployment of an investment management system in eight financial firms. Interviews with public regulatory bodies, financial institutions and technology providers reveal a culture of compliance with increased transparency, surveillance and accountability. Findings show that dialectic tensions arise as the pursuit of transparency, surveillance and accountability in compliance mandates is simultaneously rationalized, facilitated and obscured by <b>regulatory</b> <b>technology.</b> Responding to these challenges, regulatory bodies continue to impose revised compliance mandates on financial firms {{to force them to}} adapt their financial technologies in an ever-changing multi-jurisdictional regulatory landscape...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Regulatory {{change and}} {{technological}} developments following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis {{are changing the}} nature of financial markets, services, and institutions. At the juncture of these phenomena lies <b>regulatory</b> <b>technology</b> or “RegTech”—the use of technology, particularly information technology, {{in the context of}} regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance. Regulating rapidly transforming financial systems requires increasing the use of and reliance on RegTech. Whilst the principal regulatory objectives (e. g., financial stability, prudential safety and soundness, consumer protection and market integrity, and market competition and development) remain, their means of application are increasingly inadequate. RegTech developments are leading towards a paradigm shift necessitating the reconceptualization of financial regulation. RegTech to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes. This offers tremendous cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators. However, the potential of RegTech is far greater – {{it has the potential to}} enable a nearly real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while facilitating more efficient regulatory compliance. We argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be captured by a new approach at the nexus of data, digital identity, and regulation. This paper seeks to expose the inadequacy of digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial world, sets the foundation for a practical understanding of RegTech, and proposes sequenced reforms that could benefit regulators, industry, and entrepreneurs in the financial sector and other industries...|$|E

Considering the evolution of this terminological struggle alongside the proliferation of scholarship on undocumented populations, the call for eligible undocumented migrants to prepare their official documents for deferred action programs, and enactments of “documenting the undocumented” in three recent works of performance art, this thesis questions how legal labels and categories work within larger ideological regimes that determine whether Latina/o migrants in the US are granted eligibility for “legal presence,” are marked as targets for removal, or are held in a state of legal uncertainty.

40|$|Most {{government}} owned {{telecommunication operators}} {{across the world}} {{have to deal with}} a number of <b>regulatory,</b> <b>technology</b> and service challenges, as the industry is liberalised in co-ordinance with worldwide trends. Telkom SA will be facing a number of strategic challenges that will test its ability to survive as a telecommunications company over the next number of years. To remain competitive, Telkom must develop strategies to assure survival in a competitive environment. To assure the long-term survival of Telkom SA when moving into a competitive environment, the organisation must build a sustainable competitive advantage. In the face of increasingly fierce competition, the adoption of collaborative alliances between firms {{is becoming more and more}} common and the adoption of a world-class supply chain will be an ideal scenario for Telkom SA. A worldclass supply chain goes beyond the scope of the internal operations of an organisation, therefore the material distribution process was chosen for this study, which involved the internal operations in the organisation. The study included the availability of material up to the transportation of the material to the staging areas. The aim of this research was to identify the inefficiencies of the material distribution process of the Southern Region of Telkom SA to become worldclass. A quantitative technique was used to identify the inefficiencies. It was found that the availability and transportation of material were the inefficient categories, preventing the customer to receive the product or service on time. Communication, inaccurate forecasting and inefficient transportation of material were some of the reasons for not delivering material on time. Some of the recommendations included developing a model that could overcome the current inefficiencies in transportation, improving the communication channels, training and the development of employees at all levels...|$|E

40|$|Ian Ayres’s and John Braithwaite’s book Responsive Regulation: Transcending the Regulatory Debate (1992) gave us many {{significant}} insights. The {{book has}} transcended its own time. At the same time, on the 20 th anniversary of its publication, two things about Responsive Regulation are striking. The {{first is the}} direct, personal relationship on which the regulatory interaction is premised. The second is the boundedness and manageability of the regulatory project. At least in prudential regulation of global financial institutions {{in the wake of}} the recent financial crisis (though surely elsewhere too), neither of these features can be taken for granted. This brief essay seeks to open a preliminary conversation about Responsive Regulation in terms of its scalability. It considers whether as a practical matter, Responsive Regulation can be scaled up to more diffuse, multiparty, logistically complex contexts, such as financial regulation. As a matter of representation, it asks whether by projecting outward from its focal object, the responsive relationship, Responsive Regulation distorts our image of regulation in other contexts (or even in Responsive Regulation’s own home environment). The essay closes by arguing that in order to incorporate Responsive Regulation’s considerable discursive and relational benefits into regulatory environments such as global financial regulation, it needs to be buttressed by additional <b>regulatory</b> <b>technologies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The recent {{rapid growth}} of “craft beer” {{has led to a}} search for {{definitions}} and categorisation of that sector with “beer style” used as one criterion. This thesis explores the origins of these style definitions and how they act as a technology of classification which affects how sensory judgments are formed and expressed in practice, and how judges are examined and certified. The investigation draws on actor-network theory and ethnomethodology to trace how taste descriptions are assembled and translated into test items in an online exam. The material orderings and classification practices which assemble competition judging are then explored ethnographically by following the trajectory of a beer through these situated actions. The magnification is increased through developing original methods utilising digital pens, and draws on principles from conversation analysis to explore the sequential and categorial aspects of judging talk and its co-ordination with writing and form-filling. Finally, auto-ethnographic and material-semiotic explorations are used to explore how a blind beer tasting exam is assembled, and the models of learning and assessment it enacts. The historical construction of the contemporary language of sensory assessment supports the construction of the style guides. Once assembled into an information infrastructure the style guide is extended to act in multiple different ways: its propositions are translated into testable facts with multiple choices, it functions as a technology of material ordering and coordination, as a <b>regulatory</b> <b>technology</b> placing limits on how taste judgements can and cannot be expressed or recorded, and as a re-enactment and materialisation of individual cognitivist models of assessment. Through exploring the ways a classification system is assembled, translated and made authoritative this thesis extends the conceptualisation of what is considered a technology in technology enhanced learning, and extends the dialogue between that disciplinary field and scholarship in science and technology studies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This thesis aims to understand the connexions between the ethical practices associated with suffering a chronic illness and possibilities of truth, subjectivity, governmentality and freedom. This is attempted via {{an analysis of the}} specific case of HIV/AIDS. In the 1980 s there emerged a variety of competing ways to construct the truth of HIV/AIDS. By the early 1990 s, however, one particular way of thinking about and problematizing the syndrome - an account which reflected less the repressive intentions and perspectives of recently ascendant neo-liberal governments than the efforts and world-views of grass-roots community activism - had achieved ascendancy. This approach to HIV/AIDS remains today the authoritative one, and that from which expertise on the subject is derived. The emergence to pre-eminence of this way of thinking about HIV/AIDS is mapped, and three of its principal manifestations are examined in detail, using techniques of textual analysis. It is argued that within these texts, through the use of various forms of textual management, ethical subject relations of the sort discussed by Foucault are constructed, which delimit the possibilities of being for those who are touched by the disease, and which comprise elements of an ethico-panoptic <b>regulatory</b> <b>technology.</b> The parallels and differences between the technologies of government articulated via these 'community' based discourses and those of recent neo-liberal discourses are explored, with consideration being given to their implications for the practising of resistance and of freedom by people infected or affected by HIV or AIDS. Engagement with the field in this fashion is uncommon within sociology of HIV/AIDS, and to do so raises a variety of conceptual and methodological issues. Hence, within this thesis the task of interrogating HIV/AIDS discourse is radically linked to the construction of a distinct form of sociology, derived from the Foucauldian project of the 'history of the present'...|$|E
40|$|Resource {{mobilization}} is {{of fundamental}} importance to all startup ventures. In particular, ventures that operate {{in areas with}} insufficient access to basic healthcare, education, economic development, or human rights, often face severe resource constraints, because of limited access to seed funding from philanthropic and capital markets. In my dissertation I address two broad questions. First, how do entrepreneurs mobilize resources in resource-constrained environments? Second, how does the form of resource mobilization affect venture scalability? Based on the social entrepreneurship literature and theories of resource mobilization, I undertook an exploratory three-year field study of eight technology ventures within a social venture incubator to examine how social ventures mobilize resources {{in the absence of}} external sources of funding or a lack of institutional support. Using bricolage and resource-seeking as two contrasting modes of resource mobilization, I developed a model to explain how technology social ventures mobilize resources, and attract and maintain users in order to sustain growth. This model suggests that the source of funding and level of institutional support (<b>regulatory,</b> <b>technology,</b> political stability, and human development) will predict whether a venture uses bricolage or resource-seeking to mobilize resources. The model also suggests that the use of collective agency will moderate the relationship between resourcemobilization and venture scalability. I test the model on a sample of 202 technology social ventures operating in 48 countries, in one of five sectors: health, economic development, equality, education and environment. First, I found that bricolage can help a venture start up in penurious environments that lack external sources of funding or institutional support. However, bricolage is insufficient for venture growth. I found that a higher level of collective bricolage—the participation of external actors—is required to scale the venture to new markets. This dissertation contributes to the literature in technology entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship by explaining how technology social ventures mobilize resources and create scalable social innovations in penurious environments despite a scarcity of funding and institutional support. ...|$|E
