40|$|This paper proposes an {{experimental}} approach in visual landscape analysis on a GIS platform, {{which has the}} potential of integrating with ecological aspects and consequently making scientific decision making supports for urban and landscape planning practices. The research team scrutinizes the potential of the GIS platform in balancing multi-aspect planning strategies. The methodology of GIS-based visual landscape protection for <b>recreation</b> <b>purpose</b> is demonstrated through the case of the Wenzhou Ecological Park. The same platform can also be introduced the landscape ecology capacity analysis. This methodology can improve the comprehensiveness of the landscape resource management system, and enhance its validity and reliability in its application in the landscape ecologically considerable projects...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study on psammophilous grasslands, conducted during the years 1994 – 1997 and in 2008 in the Masurian Lake District (NE Poland). The study aimed at the determina-tion of floristic composition, phytosociological diversity and habitat characteristics. Field work resulted in 511 phytosociological relevés. Soil samples were taken to determine pH, hydrolytic acidity, sum of basic cations, cation exchange capacity, content of CaCO 3 and total carbon. In 2008, the presence of communities dominated by grey-hair grass (Corynephorus canescens) in the previously established sites was checked. TWINSPAN was used for hierarchic classification of the association Corniculario aculeatae-Corynephoretum canescentis (syn. Spergulo morisonii-Corynephoretum canescentis). Accordingly, the association is divided into four subtypes (typical subtype, subtype with Cladonia mitis, subtype with Thymus serpyllum and subtype with Festuca ovina) with nine variants. Field observations showed that the communities analyzed have been under strong anthropogenic pressure, causing their degeneration and decrease in area. The most common human uses of psammophilous grassland communities are housing development, road construction, afforestation, sand extraction, wood storage and unauthorized dump-ing. In contrast to the above types of land use, seasonal use of grasslands for <b>recreation</b> <b>purpose...</b>|$|E
