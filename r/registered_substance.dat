30|$|A CSR is {{obligatory}} for all <b>registered</b> <b>substances</b> used above 10 tonnes {{per annum}} and if the substance fulfils the criteria for hazards listed in Regulation (EC) No 1272 / 2008 (or PBT or vPvB), then exposure scenarios {{also need to be}} developed. These exposure scenarios describe the processes, operational conditions and RMM for the safe use throughout the whole life cycle for a substance. This is the centrepiece of REACH by which standards of health and safety at work can be raised, but the requirements of the CSR are challenging.|$|R

30|$|Two reasons {{support the}} use of {{alternative}} assessment methods: alternative methods for hazard assessment are necessary, as animal testing should be avoided if possible. On the other hand, there is the problem that for specific situations reliable information needed for assessing the hazard potential of a substance is missed when only the established standard assessment schemes, which consist mostly of laboratory tests, are used. The latter leads to misjudgment of substances, which need to be identified as SVHC. To illustrate this point, a small number exercise can be employed: there is an obvious mismatch between the number of <b>substances</b> <b>registered</b> under REACH and the number of substances identified as PBT/vPvB. Currently, 9032 substances (as of the 31.12. 2015) are registered under REACH. However, there are only 22 substances (as of 3.12. 2015) identified as PBT and/or vPvB substances so far and not all of them have been registered. If all of these would have been registered, that would amount to 0.2  % of the <b>registered</b> <b>substances.</b> In a study by Strempel et al. [2], 94, 483 substances of the European Inventory of Existing Commercial chemical <b>Substances</b> (EINECS <b>register)</b> were screened for PBT and vPvB properties. Based on their results, the authors estimate that approximately 3  % of all the <b>substances</b> in the <b>register,</b> i.e. 2930 <b>substances,</b> might be PBT/vPvB substances. In comparison to the 22 PBT/vPvB substances currently identified, this is a mismatch that can only partially be {{explained by the fact that}} the REACH registration has been in force for merely 9  years.|$|R
25|$|In the U.S., {{to qualify}} copper and its alloys as <b>registered</b> {{antimicrobial}} <b>substances</b> under that nation's federal pesticide regulations, an extensive additional body of efficiency testing under Good Laboratory Practice guidelines by an EPA-approved laboratory was {{required by the}} EPA.

30|$|After {{the first}} {{registration}} deadline on December 2010, approximately 5, 000 individual <b>substances</b> were <b>registered</b> including intermediates (OSII, TII) and low tonnage substances (1 to 10 t/a) {{for which no}} DNELs and DMELs were derived. The analysis revealed 1, 728 substances with unambiguous identity for which 4, 765 DNELs and DMELs for workers were derived. Number and type of DNELs and DMELs depend on the identified uses and exposure scenarios submitted with the registration of a substance. In ECHA's public database, the DNELs and DMELs are presented deep within the structure. An easily accessible and searchable source which specifically provides DNELs and DMELs for <b>registered</b> <b>substances</b> was made available by the German social accidence insurance [20]. It {{is not possible to}} conclude whether all DNELs and DMELs required by REACH have been derived because the number of DNELs and DMELs depend on the hazard, the existing exposure and the approach chosen.|$|R
30|$|Discussion and Conclusions If <b>substances</b> are {{adequately}} <b>registered,</b> all {{identified and}} supported uses including {{their use in}} articles should be assessed. Therefore, where the full implementation of the registration conditions applies a substantial improvement may be expected due to REACH. Usually, producers or importers of articles {{are not required to}} <b>register</b> <b>substances</b> contained in these articles. Instead, the manufacturer or importer of the respective substance is usually responsible for registration, if exposure to the substance cannot be excluded and emission of the substance from an article is not the intended purpose. This may differ for substances intentionally released from articles. Additional obligations for substances not intentionally released mainly apply to substances of very high concern (SVHC). For the latter, the producer or importer of articles has to notify the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the occurrence of the respective SVHC in articles. This information is important, especially because substances in imported articles may not be registered in advance.|$|R
50|$|When REACH {{is fully}} in force, {{it will require}} all {{companies}} manufacturing or importing chemical substances into the European Union in quantities of one tonne or more per year to <b>register</b> these <b>substances</b> with a new European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki, Finland.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion re-evaluating the safety of montan acid esters (E 912) when used as a food additive. Montan acids are extracted from oxidised montan wax and esterified with ethylene glycol, 1, 3 -butanediol or triols, to form montan acid esters. Montan acid esters are authorised only for the surface treatment of fresh fruits. No data, specifically for montan acid esters, on toxicokinetics and reproductive and developmental toxicity were available. The available data on short-term and subchronic toxicity, genotoxicity and chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity were limited. Important deficiencies in the available studies on chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity were noticed. The data requested in the 1990 s (i. e. chromosomal aberration in vitro, reproduction and teratogenicity studies, material characteristics, impurities, presence of PAHs) were not submitted. Furthermore no data were submitted following an EFSA public call for data in 2012. The Panel identified some summary data in the European Chemicals Agency database (ECHA) on <b>registered</b> <b>substances</b> {{that might have been}} relevant for the assessment of montan acid esters but the original study reports were not made available to EFSA.

40|$|The Dutch {{decision}} tree on leaching from soil has been re-designed {{to be more}} in line with EU guidelines on the assessment of the leaching potential of substances. The new {{decision tree}} explicitly defines reasonable worst-case conditions as the 90 th percentile of the area to which a substance is applied. The tree also determines whether the median annual leaching concentration over a period of 20, 40 or 60 years complies with the EU-drinking water limit, with the length of the period depending on the application frequency. The FOCUS Kremsmnster scenario, officially adopted in the Netherlands as the national scenario, is, in the first tier, used to identify substances with a negligible leaching risk, which can then be registered without further assessment. The core of the decision tree is the second tier, in which the spatially distributed model, GeoPEARL, is used to calculate the leaching. The third tier considers the water-saturated zone up to a depth of 10 m below soil surface. As this tier did not need an update, the new approach is expected to have very little influence on the number of <b>registered</b> <b>substances.</b> Comparing the new approach with the old, we found the new first tier to be almost as strict as the old one, at least when the safety factor of 100 was not used, as in the old tree. For substances for which the leaching concentration was calculated at around 0, 1 ug dm- 3 using the old procedure, GeoPEARL yielded results that were approximately 10 times higher. This difference was mainly due to the annual application of the substances in the new procedure...|$|R
30|$|The safety {{data sheet}} (SDS) shall enable the {{recipient}} to take the necessary measures to protect the health of workers and the environment. Under current health and safety legislation the SDS is the main information source for employers undertaking risk assessment involving hazardous substances. The legal obligations of article 37 (7) of REACH require those who prepare a CSR to place the relevant exposure scenario in an annex to the SDS. This SDS is called extended {{safety data sheet}} (eSDS). The (e)SDS links legislations of placing chemicals {{on the market and}} worker protection. A CSR has to be provided for specific <b>registered</b> <b>substances</b> only; however, in workplaces, mixtures of substances are commonly used [22]. Therefore, most employers will be confronted with exposure scenarios that apply only for a minority of their workplace chemicals. It is the formulator as the first downstream user who mainly has {{to deal with the problem}} of utilising the exposure scenarios provided in the eSDS, and to consolidate them along with relevant information into SDSs for their products. Exposure scenarios, especially those for the workplace, are likely to be numerous and specific to bespoke processes and business practices. For a widely used solvent with for example 10 identified uses often as many as 80 different contributing exposure scenarios are compiled. Many of these exposure scenarios may be quite similar and differ only in minor details. It is difficult to consolidate all of this information into a handful of relevant specifications for safe handling as required in Sections 7 and 8 of the SDS. This is an important issue as the SDS is intended to be a clear and concise document, which takes into account the specific needs and knowledge of the user group.|$|R
30|$|When {{preparing}} the Annex XV-Dossiers for anthracene and anthracene derivatives {{it became clear}} that environmental exposure to these substances is mainly due to constituents in other UVCB-substances of different sources. Like other PAH of concern, anthracene and anthracene derivatives are not <b>registered,</b> because these <b>substances</b> are neither produced nor marketed as single substances. The environmental exposure is due to UVCB-constituents. Hence regulating PAH as certain single substances is not appropriate to address the concerns. Therefore the concept of substance in substances (SiS) was developed.|$|R

40|$|The {{protection}} of the health of athletes {{is one of the}} three criteria taken into account when <b>registering</b> a <b>substance</b> in the World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited list. Nevertheless, in elite-level cycling, banned substance use is widespread. The present research adopted a psychological approach to examine how or whether perceived health risks influence elite-level cyclists' decisions to use banned substances. Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with cyclists hoping to join a professional team (n= 6), neo-professional cyclists (n= 2), and former professional cyclists (n= 8). Although an evolution was observed in the organization of doping and perceptions of doping over the last decade, the perceived health hazards did not influence, most of the time, decisions to use banned substances among the sample of cyclists. There was a systematization of exogenous substance use in the cycling environment and a trivialization of the side effects of the banned substances. Finally, younger cyclists were not concerned about the long-term health consequences of banned substances; they were more focused on the short-term performance-enhancing benefits. There is a need to implement more effective preventive programs to change athletes' attitudes toward doping and its health risks. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{based on}} the {{suggestions}} within the guidance document [2], our aim is to define criteria for borderline chemicals and to support the prioritization of SVHC within the <b>substances</b> <b>registered</b> in the publicly available REACH database. A screening method will be applied to identify substances, which either fulfil the PBT/vPvB criteria or, more importantly, which slightly fail these criteria but should also be considered as borderline cases for SVHC since their LRTP indicates a higher potential for adverse effects {{on the environment and}} human health. Prioritized substances will be investigated by a sensitivity analysis and an additional literature research to evaluate the assumptions on which the screening steps are based. This leads to a refined and reduced list of compounds whose properties strongly indicate very high concern and which should be investigated in more detail.|$|R

It occurs in children as well as adults but is usually outgrown in infancy (Keet et al 2009). If you or your child are experiencing allergic symptoms and suspect wheat is triggering them, it is important to visit your GP, who can organise a referral to an allergy specialist. This factsheet aims to answer some of the questions which you and your family might have about living with wheat allergy. Our aim is to provide information that will help you to avoid products containing wheat, minimise risks and know how to treat an allergic reaction should it occur.

Food allergy {{occurs when the}} body’s immune system reacts to a harmless food component, usually a protein, because it mistakenly <b>registers</b> that <b>substance</b> as a threat. In people with wheat allergy, the immune system has produced substances called immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE) which are specifically activated when they encounter wheat.

40|$|REACH) Regulation (EC 1907 / 2006) places {{significant}} new obligations on the manufacturers or importers (M/Is) of chemicals in Europe. It also places new responsibilities on downstream users (DUs) of these chemicals i. e. those that purchase and use chemical products. In partic-ular, for <b>registered</b> classified <b>substances,</b> the M/I {{is expected to}} communicate how any sub-stance can be safely used without risk to man or the environment.

Aim: To determine drug use among Iranian adults who were imprisoned for vehicle accidents with fatality. Methods: This study enrolled 51 Iranian adults who were imprisoned for vehicle accidents with fatality. This sample came from a national survey of prisoners. Data was collected at entry to prisons during the last 4 months of 2008 in 7 prisons {{in different parts of the}} country. Self reported drug use was <b>registered.</b> Commercial <b>substance</b> use screening tests were also done. Results: Drug test was positive for opioids, cannabis and both in 37. 3 %, 2. 0 % and 13. 7 %, respectively. 29. 4 % tested positive for benzodiazepines. Using test introduced 23. 5 % of our sample as drug users, who had declined to report any drug use. Conclusion: Opioids are the most used illicit drug in the case of vehicle accidents with fatality, however, 20 % of users do not declare their use. This high rate of drug use in vehicle accidents with fatality reflects the importance of drug use control as a part of injury prevention in Iran.
