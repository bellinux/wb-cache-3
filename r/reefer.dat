5|$|As Peter {{exits the}} {{abortion}} clinic, he notices a pro-life rally nearby. At the rally, a protester shows Peter a video tape discouraging abortion (as {{a reference to}} the cult classic 1936 American propaganda exploitation film <b>Reefer</b> Madness), portraying it as murder, larceny, jaywalking and securities fraud. The tape claims that abortion prevented Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's would-be assassin, a fourth Stooge brother, of The Three Stooges, and Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden's America-loving brother from being born.|$|E
5|$|With Pink Flamingos (1972) and <b>Reefer</b> Madness (1936) {{making money}} in midnight showings nationwide, a Fox executive, Tim Deegan, {{was able to}} talk {{distributors}} into midnight screenings, starting in New York City on April Fools' Day of 1976. The cult following started shortly after the film began its midnight run at the Waverly Theater in New York City., then spread to other counties in NYC, and to Uniondale, L.I. Rocky Horror was not only found in the larger cities but throughout the United States where many attendees would get in free if they arrived in costume. The western division of the film's release included The U.A. Cinemas in Fresno and Merced, The Cinema J in Sacramento, California, and the Covell in Modesto. In New Orleans, an early organised performance group was active with the release there {{as well as in}} such cities as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Chicago (at the Biograph Theater). Before long nearly every screening of the film was accompanied by a live fan cast.|$|E

50|$|Water cooling {{systems are}} expensive, so modern vessels {{rely more on}} {{ventilation}} to remove heat from cargo holds, {{and the use of}} water cooling systems is declining. Air cooling and water cooling are usually combined. Air cooling removes the heat generated by the <b>reefers</b> while water cooling helps to minimise the heat rejected by the <b>reefers.</b> The <b>reefers</b> are using some heat exchangers that behaves as water cooled condensers: water cooling.|$|R

25|$|Since {{the turn}} of the millennium, the most notable success among newly minted midnight movies has been Donnie Darko (2001). Older films are also popular on the circuit, {{appreciated}} largely in an imposed camp fashion—a midnight movie tradition that goes back to the 1972 revival of the hectoring anti-drug movie <b>Reefer</b> Madness (1938). (Tod Browning's 1932 horror classic Freaks, the original midnight movie revival, is both too dark and too sociologically acute to readily consume as camp.) Where the irony with which <b>Reefer</b> Madness was adopted as a midnight favorite had its roots in a countercultural sensibility, in the latter's place there is now the parodoxical element of nostalgia: the leading revivals on the circuit currently include the crème de la crème of the John Hughes oeuvre—The Breakfast Club (1985), Pretty in Pink (1986), and Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)—and the preteen adventure film The Goonies (1985). As of late 2006, Rocky Horror itself continues to play on a weekly basis at thirty-two venues around the country, and {{at least once a month}} at about two dozen others.|$|E

25|$|In {{countries}} where the railway loading gauge is sufficient, truck trailers are often carried by rail. Variations exist, including open-topped versions covered by a fabric curtain are used to transport larger loads. A container called a tanktainer, with a tank inside a standard container frame, carries liquids. Refrigerated containers (<b>reefer)</b> are used for perishables.

The ship would additionally be fitted over the cutwater with an iron, V-shaped icebreaker 3/8 of an inch thick and extending 18inches {{above and below the}} waterline, secured by a number of heavy chains.
