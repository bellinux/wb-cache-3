40|$|The CNS {{action of}} 2 -guanidinoethanol (GEt), {{that has been}} {{identified}} in human urine, was investigated in male S. D. rats. Effects of GABA (1 μmol, on the pia mater), diazepam (DZP) (10 mg/kg, i. p.), muscimol (50 nmol, on the pia mater), (3 R) -(-) - 4 -amino- 3 -hydroxybutanoic acid ((L) -GABOB) (1 μmol, on the pia mater), phenobarbital (PB) (20 mg/kg, i. m.), dephenylhydantoin (PHT) (25 mg/kg, i. p.) or valproate (VPA) (200 mg/kg, i. p.) on convulsive seizures or on spike discharges (Sp-D) induced by GEt were examined. Several min after the intraventricular injection of 25 μl of GEt solution (300 mM), rats started to show myoclonic twitching, <b>running</b> <b>fit</b> and tonic and clonic convulsions. When GEt was injected intraventricularly about 30 ~ 40 min after the administration of DZP or PB, rats started to show myoclonic twitching several min after the application of GEt, but rats did not show running fits, tonic convulsions or clonic convulsions for over 4 h. EEG (epidural electrodes) revealed initiation of Sp-D several min after an intraventricular injection of GEt (25 μl). Thereafter, polyspikes, 3 cps spike & wave complex and finally ictal seizures developed about 30 to 60 min after the injection. EEG revealed Sp-D within 2 ~ 10 min {{on the side of}} the GEt application on the pia mater (3 μmol), and then a burst of multiple Sp-D developed. During the burst, Sp-D propagated to the opposite cerebral hemisphere. Two hours after the topical application, propagation of Sp-D was completed. In rats given muscimol topically together with GEt, Sp-D were not induced, and Sp-D induced by GEt were suppressed withiin 10 min by the supplimentation of muscimol. While (L-) GABOB and GABA showed a suppressive effet on Sp-D induced by GEt, after pre-application of these two substances, GEt induced Sp-D with longer latency. About 20 min after injection of PB, DZP or PHT, GEt was applied on the pia mater, but Sp-D were not induced. PB, DZP, PHT or VPA, applied 20 min after the application of GEt, suppressed Sp-D induced by GEt. While VPA showed a suppressive effect on Sp-D, GEt induced Sp-D after preapplication of VPA. These findings suggest that GEt acts on the GABAergic system to induce convulsive activity...|$|E

40|$|The naturally-occurring dicarboxylic amino acids, L-glutamate (Glu) and L-aspartate, are the {{principal}} neurotransmitter candidates for excitatory synaptic transmission in vertebrate central nervous systems. The receptors activated by these amino acids are classified by their most selective and potent agonists, i. e., N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), kainic acid, and quisqualic acid. In this study, I {{examined the effects of}} NMDA on behavior, electroencephalogram (EEG), and brain amino acids levels after intraventricular injection in mice. When NMDA was intraventricularly injected into mice, <b>running</b> <b>fits</b> were observed 10 - 30 seconds after injection, followed by a sedative phase and returned to a normal behavior within 15 - 20 minutes after injection. In the EEG, middle voltage fast waves were observed 10 - 20 seconds after injection, followed by EEG suppression {{for a few minutes and}} the appearance of high voltage slow waves 4 - 5 minutes after injection. About 20 minutes after the injection the EEG was normal. No spike discharge was observed during this observation. Glu levels increased in the hippocampus during <b>running</b> <b>fits,</b> while GABA levels decreased in the cerebellum and hippocampus before <b>running</b> <b>fits,</b> and increased in the cerebellum 10 minutes after NMDA injection. The taurine level decreased in the striatum before <b>running</b> <b>fits.</b> All amino acids observed recovered to control levels 60 minutes after NMDA injection. These results indicate that the NMDA-induced <b>running</b> <b>fits</b> are not accompanied by spike discharges in the EEG, and are related to Glu and GABA neurons...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of tolerance to therapeutic effects of antiepileptic drugs {{can be a}} problem in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and pain syndromes. In the present study, acute treatment with the new antiepileptic drug lamotrigine (LTG, 15 mg/kg) markedly suppressed seizure stage and seizure duration in amygdala-kindled rats; but this antiseizure effect was rapidly lost following 4 - 8 days of repeated treatment. When gabapentin (GBP, 20 mg/kg) was coadministered with LTG, the ability of LTG to suppress seizure stage, seizure duration, and after-discharge (AD) duration was markedly extended. In addition, GBP coadministration with LTG decreased the number of animals that developed LTG-related <b>running</b> <b>fits</b> (Stage 6 seizures) and lengthened the number of days required to develop <b>running</b> <b>fits</b> or complete tolerance. Neither acute nor repeated treatment with MK- 801 (0. 3 mg/kg), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, had effects on kindled seizures. However, cotreatment with MK- 801 markedly extended the anticonvulsant effects of LTG on the three seizure indices and reduced <b>running</b> <b>fits.</b> These data indicate that cotreatment with either GBP or MK- 801 slows tolerance development to the anticonvulsant effects of LTG on kindled seizures. Therapeutic implications of the present study remain to be explored. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The CNS {{action of}} methylguanidine (MGua) was {{investigated}} in male S. D. rats. The effects of a GABA-agonist and anticonvulsants on the MGua-induced EEG changes were studied. Several min after an intraventricular injection of 10 μl of a MGua solution (100 mM), rats displayed <b>running</b> <b>fits,</b> tonic- and clonic-convulsion with myoclonic twitching accompanied by polyspikes and spike bursts in the EEG. Diazepam (DZP) (10 mg/kg, i. p.) inhibited the convulsive activity, but ethosuximide (ESM) (200 mg/kg, i. p.) showed no effect. Sporadic spike discharges began 2 - 10 min after MGua (1 μmol) application to the pia mater of the sensorimotor cortex, and thereafter, a recurrent ictal seizure pattern (ISP) was induced. The ISPs were suppressed by DZP (10 mg/kg) and phenobarbital (PB) (20 mg/kg), injected {{after the completion of}} ISPs induced by MGua. Spike discharges were not induced by the application of MGua together with muscimol (50 nmol), although muscimol did not suppress the ISPs following their completion. Intraperitoneal injection of either ESM (50 - 200 mg/kg), valproate (200 mg/kg) or phenytoin (25 mg/kg), after the completion of ISPs, did not affect the ISPs. These findings suggest that GABAA receptors might participate in the induction mechanism of MGua-induced seizure activities, and that DZP and PB receptors might a play role in the mechanism which suppresses MGua-induced Seizures...|$|R

The baseboard is small, typically 4 x 2 ft, but a long <b>running</b> line <b>fits</b> in, owing to the curves. Their purpose is to show a continuously moving train, lurching from side to side across reverse curves, with unpredictable re-appearances from the tunnel mouths.

Some layouts in the 1970s used the early transistorised control circuits then becoming available to run automatically, switching between trains as each entered the loop.|$|R

40|$|Sports {{commentators}} at ATV and TVB offered invaluable insights. They are {{not responsible}} for my errors, and vice versa. The study of games has become a popular sport among economists (Fisher 1989). In this field theory leads empirics by a wide margin. To redress the imbalance and bring some competitiveness back into the sport, this paper presents an econometric study of a real life game: the 1992 Summer Olympics. Using a reduced form model {{in the spirit of the}} structure-conduct-performance paradigm, the performance of national teams are found to be closely related to three variables: population, income, and political structure. In fact these three variables alone explain more than thirty percent of the variation in the number of medals won by different teams. I.
