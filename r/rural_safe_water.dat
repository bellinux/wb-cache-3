40|$|Uganda has {{experienced}} a major policy shift from a supply-driven to a demand-driven approach in rural water provision since 1990. The article sheds light on the rural population’s access to safe water within the changing institutional frameworks. We analysed individual and group interviews with key informants from national to community levels and relevant official documents with the ‘Social-Ecological Systems’ framework. Since {{the implementation of the}} demand-driven approach, <b>rural</b> <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> coverage has slightly improved but operation and maintenance of water sources pose a great challenge hampering, long-term access to safe water. The abrupt and top-down imposed policy shift has resulted in competing signals from old and new policies creating uncertainty and ambiguity about responsibilities, rules and incentives. The analysis shows the importance of taking into account the implications of national institutional disturbances on local collective action for long-term access to safe water...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the key governance dynamics in Uganda’s <b>rural</b> <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> supply service systems. It aims to unravel policy and contextual issues that undermine {{effectiveness of the}} currently dominant community-based management (CBM) model of water supply and sustainability. Broadly, CBM is founded within the neoliberal and post-welfare policy regimes that promote the philosophy of a ‘reduced state’. More specifically, CBM forms {{part of the new}} public management (NPM) and governance frameworks that promote decentralised and multi-actor approaches to ‘efficient’ and more ‘responsive’ public service delivery that include networks or partnerships between public and private (for profit and not-for-profit) actors, and service beneficiaries. Whereas evidence has shown that effective CBM translates into high levels of equity, efficiency and overall sustainability of services, policy proposals and institutional frameworks promoting it continue to show varying results across and within countries. Uganda provides a case study of contexts where CBM has not produced good results despite its promotion and inclusion within the policy and institutional framework for <b>rural</b> <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> supply. Using a single case and mixed methods research design, this study undertook an extensive review of Uganda’s national water sector policy and programme documents, in addition to interviews with key water sector actors from the public, private and civil society sectors, and the water user community. The results of the study indicate that whereas CBM is well-known in Uganda’s rural water sector and policy framework to be a desirable approach for achieving the much needed sustainability of rural point-water supply, service authorities especially from government are not consciously taking the necessary actions to leverage its effectiveness. This failure is {{at the very heart of}} the weaknesses within the post welfare policy agenda which embraces policies such as decentralisation, ‘marketisation’, participatory and demand responsive approaches as well as networks or partnerships in the provision of public goods and services. The study suggests an enabling framework for CBM systems for rural point water facilities, which does not completely reject the idea of government withdrawal from public service delivery as proposed in the neoliberal framework. The framework rather argues for the need for public authorities in democratic states to pay deliberate attention to context specific circumstances and conditions that tend to disable good policy and programme proposals such as those embedded within the CBM model of rural water supply and sustainability in developing contexts similar to Uganda. The study therefore advocates an effective central and local government authority that consciously and creatively fulfills its ‘new roles’ conceived within the frameworks of NPM and good governance, and reflected in popular views of government as an ‘enabler’, thereby extending the debates on the role of government in the post-welfare, neoliberal and good governance agenda...|$|E

This {{has resulted in the}} country’s inability to substantially improve coverage of the <b>rural</b> population with <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> and improved sanitation services. This is particularly obvious in the field of sanitation and hygiene. Also the poor management of water and sanitation resources are the impediment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

This paper examines current water treatment measures and implementation methods for delivery of <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water,</b> and offers suggestions for making progress towards the goal of providing a timely and equitable solution for <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> provision. For water treatment, based on the serious limitations of boiling water and chlorination, we suggest an approach based on filtration coupled with ultraviolet (UV) disinfection, combined with public education. Additionally, owing to the capacity limitations for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to take on this task primarily on their own, we suggest a strategy based on financially sustainable models that include the private sector as well as NGOs...|$|R

50|$|About 88% of {{the urban}} {{population}} in Ghana have access to at least basic drinking water. However, disparities exist between urban and <b>rural</b> <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water</b> access. According to the Ghana Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey of 2011, urban dwellers {{are more likely to}} have access to <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water</b> than the rural dwellers at 91% and 69%, respectively. Consequently, dependency on unsafe water sources is higher in rural areas. The turbidites of most local surface waters in rural areas are greater than 200 NTUs (nephelometric turbidity units) and contain high microbial and fecal contamination, putting children and the rest of the population at high risk for water-related diseases. Compared to the rest of the country, the three northern regions of Ghana are particularly deprived of clean drinking water, with one in ten children dying before their fifth birthday due to some water-related illnesses. In the main Northern Region of Ghana alone, 32% of the 2.5 million residents lack access to improved water sources and must often resort to contaminated drinking-water. Regarding sanitation, only 14% of the total population of Ghana are using an improved sanitation facility as of 2010.This table presents the classifications of improved and unimproved water sources in Ghana since the end of the Millennium Development Goals, according to the WHO and UNICEF. As of the end of 2015, improved water sources included household water pipes, boreholes, protected dug wells and springs, and public standpipes.|$|R
40|$|The lack {{of clean}} water is a major risk factor for poor health and sanitation, and it has major health impacts on <b>rural</b> communities. <b>Safe</b> {{drinking}} <b>water</b> is fundamental to health, survival, growth and development. The study is based on data collection through surveys, interview, focus group discussion, and consultation of medical reports at Ampara RDHS and project reports at Ampara NWSDB, and other relevant authorities. Using the secondary information, the paper demonstrates the status of CKD (Chronic Kidney Diseases) {{in the recent past}} in all Grama Niladhari divisions in the study community, and it explores Community Water Supply or Rural Water Supply (RWS) projects implemented by the National Water Supply and Drainages Board (NWSDB) with the support from Government and International Organizations in the CKD affected villages, in order to mitigate water crisis in Dehiyattakandia. This study found that the scarcity of <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water</b> was not an outright factor for endemic of CKD, perhaps, the scarcity of <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water</b> was one of the major factors to determine this health implication among rural communities in Dehiyattakandia. Further, this paper argues that prevalent of CKD has been controlled by eradicating water crisis through community participation mechanism implemented by the NWSDB and other stakeholders in the rural water supply projects in the study community. Thus, the CBOs were highly motivated to maneuver rural water poverty reduction at all levels. Hence, the real factor for this CKD also need to be investigated scientifically. However, this study suggests that the awareness programmes and community participation in the rural water supply projects need to be enriched to ensure the availability of adequate <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water</b> and protect rural communities from severe health hazards...|$|R

Village level map of existing <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> options for this Upazila has been prepared using data on number of water supply technologies for each village using ArcGIS 9. 1. Hydrometeorological, geological and hydrogeological data have been analyzed to decipher the geohydro-environment in order to validate site specific water supply options. Existence of different <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> options in every village alongside population density has been presented in the map in order to identify high, medium and low priority areas.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the disappointing adoption rates of point-of-use (POU) <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> technologies designed to expand access to <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water</b> {{in the developing}} world. Low cost <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> technologies substantially reduce diarrheal disease (Clasen et al. 2006). Nev-ertheless, they remain little used {{in many parts of}} the developing world, even when widely available. We present results from a randomized field study in Kenya that provided all partic-ipant households a variety of free <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> technologies in order to test hypothesized infor-mational and behavioral constraints to the decision to use any <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> technology. Sharing common (village-level) source water quality information increases water treatment by 8 - 13 percentage points, representing a 12 - 23 % increase over base values; the additional sharing of personalized (household-level) water quality information does not further increase use. Social marketing messages that harness findings from behavioral economics to encourage adoption of a <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> technology further increased water treatment by 9 - 11 percentage points overall. These results suggest promising avenues for incremental improvements in the market for <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> (and other) technologies. More broadly, they present further evidence against a model of decision making that assumes full information and fully formed preferences. JEL CODES...|$|R
40|$|Ever since arsenic {{contamination}} of groundwater {{was discovered in}} Bangladesh in the 1990 ’s, several international organizations and NGOs have been constructing <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> devices for mitigating the associated problems. However, many such <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> devices were abandoned {{due to lack of}} maintenance. This article analyzes how and why the use of these devices had stopped, through the use of interviews made with officials of the device operating committees. It was found that, in one example, an active <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> device had a well-organized operating committee, headed by a leading member of the community who was held in high regard. In contrast, an inactive <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> device in a neighboring village was found to have an unstable organizing committee; in this case an unmotivated community leader who had his own access to <b>safe</b> drinking <b>water.</b> The maintenance of <b>safe</b> <b>water</b> devices therefore greatly depends on leadership in the community. A future concern should see the implementation of methods of sustainable device maintenance that is free from the issues of community unity and/or leadership. 国民の９割が地下水を飲用に利用しているバングラデシュでは 1990 年代に地下水砒素汚染が明らかになり問題になっている｡以降､国内外の機関によって対策活動として､安全な水を供給するための装置(代替水源装置) が建設されてきた｡しかし､建設された多くの代替水源装置において維持管理が適切に行われず結果的に放棄される例などが報告されている｡本研究は､代替水源装置の運営(維持管理) がどうして､どのように立ち行かなくなっていくのかということについて､装置の管理組合の役員にインタビューを行い､明らかにするものである｡順調に稼動している代替水源装置においては､尊敬されている人物が組合のリーダーを務めておりその人物を中心として利用世帯がまとまっていたり､日常的に装置のメンテナンスを行う人物の存在が見られた｡一方､維持管理が放棄されている代替水源装置においては､組合のリーダーや､コミュニティ全体に関連する問題が見られた｡今後､放棄される代替水源装置の数を減らし､代替水源装置によって安定的に安全な水を供給するためには､いいリーダーがいない､又はまとまって何かを解決することが難しいという地域社会において､どうすれば代替水源装置は安定的に稼動させることができるのかという点が重要な課題となるであろう...|$|R
