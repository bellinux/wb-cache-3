The earliest storm to affect the state was the 1952 Groundhog Day Tropical Storm, and the latest storm to impact the state was a hurricane making landfall on December1, 1925.|$|E

25|$|A <b>review</b> <b>paper</b> by N. W. Bailey and Marlene Zuk {{looking into}} studies of {{same-sex}} sexual behaviour in animals challenges {{the view that}} such behaviour lowers reproductive success, citing several hypotheses about how same-sex sexual behavior might be adaptive; these hypotheses vary greatly among different species. Bailey and Zuk also suggest future research needs to look into evolutionary consequences of same-sex sexual behaviour, rather than only looking into origins of such behaviour.|$|E
25|$|The rates {{varied from}} 0.8% to 30% in these studies, {{with a median}} rate of 3.7% extrapair {{paternity}}. A range of 1.8% to 3.7% extrapair paternity implies a range of 96% to 98% genetic monogamy. Although the incidence of genetic monogamy may vary from 70% to 99% in different cultures or social environments, {{a large percentage of}} couples remain genetically monogamous during their relationships. A <b>review</b> <b>paper,</b> surveying 67 other studies, reported rates of extrapair paternity, in different societies, ranging from 0.4% to over 50%.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} <b>review</b> <b>paper</b> by Bornemissza {{states that}} by 1975, 23 species of dung beetle, including 3 genetic variants, had been released. By 1984, this number was 43 species, {{although it was}} found that 20 of these failed to establish. As well as the original “star” of the program, Onthophagus gazella, establishing well, other species such as Euoniticellus intermedius, Onthophagus binodis and Liatongus militaris were shown to have reproduced in their thousands and became abundant enough to allow the transfer of subpopulations of certain colonies to establish in new areas.|$|E

25|$|Hoyle's work {{explained}} how the abundances {{of the elements}} increased with time as the galaxy aged. Subsequently, Hoyle's picture was expanded during the 1960s by contributions from William A. Fowler, Alastair G. W. Cameron, and Donald D. Clayton, followed by many others. The seminal 1957 <b>review</b> <b>paper</b> by E. M. Burbidge, G. R. Burbidge, Fowler and Hoyle is a well-known summary {{of the state of}} the field in 1957. That paper defined new processes for the transformation of one heavy nucleus into others within stars, processes that could be documented by astronomers.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, {{graduate}} student Ryan Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an Archaeopteryx specimen. Using {{scanning electron microscopy}} technology and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, the team was able to detect the structure of melanosomes in the single-feather specimen described in 1861. The resultant structure was then {{compared to that of}} 87modern bird species and was determined with a highest likelihood to be black. The feather studied was most probably a single covert, which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings. The study does not mean that Archaeopteryx was entirely black, but suggests that it had some black colouration which included the coverts. Carney pointed out that this is consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics, in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight. In a 2013 study published in the Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry, new analyses of Archaeopteryxs feathers revealed that the animal may have had complex light- and dark-coloured plumage, with heavier pigmentation in the distal tips and outer vanes. In a press release, Carney argued against this interpretation, insisting the wing feather was [...] "matte black with a darker tip" [...] and one of his colleagues also brought up the subject in a <b>review</b> <b>paper</b> however, no new evidence was published.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Baliunas and {{aerospace}} engineer Willie Soon published a <b>review</b> <b>paper</b> on historical climatology in Climate Research, which concluded that [...] "the 20th century {{is probably not}} the warmest nor a uniquely extreme climatic period of the last millennium." [...] With Soon, Baliunas investigated the correlation between solar variability and temperatures of the Earth's atmosphere. When there are more sunspots, the total solar output increases, and when there are fewer sunspots, it decreases. Soon and Baliunas attribute the Medieval warm period to such an increase in solar output, and believe that decreases in solar output led to the Little Ice Age, a period of cooling from which the earth has been recovering since 1890.|$|E

[...] A year later, two WRKY transcription factors, ABF1 and ABF2, established {{the role of}} WRKY proteins as a novel family of transcriptional regulators. [...] In 1996 three parsley (Petroselinum crispum) WRKY transcription factors (WRKY1, WRKY2, and WRKY3) were identified for their role in regulation of the PATHOGENESIS RELATED1 gene. [...] This {{was the first of}} many studies identifying WRKY transcription factors in regulating gene expression for plant defense. [...] By 2000 a <b>review</b> <b>paper</b> published identifying the WRKY transcription factor family in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (commonly called mouse-ear cress or thale cress) lead to a widespread investigation of WRKY family members. [...] Since then WRKY transcription factors have been extensively investigated for stress tolerance in many agronomic and horticulture crops.|$|E
