To determine the specificty of the protection, a procedure based on biological activity was developed for the separation and purification of the restriction endonucleases from H. influenzae strain Rd. Two endonuclease R activities presumably corresponding to Hind II and Hind III (P. H. Roy and H. O. Smith, 1973; H. O. Smith and K. W.

40|$|Background & objectives: Typhoid fever is a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the developing countries including India. Resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents is an emerging global problem that has serious impact on the treatment of disease. There are many factors associated with the emergence of resistance. Most important of them is the acquisition and further transmission and spread of <b>resistance</b> <b>markers</b> among various bacterial species. Therefore, we conducted this study to characterize the resistance plasmids in terms of their transferability and stability among Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Methods: Six multidrug-resistant S. Typhi isolates were evaluated for the stability and transfer of <b>resistance</b> <b>markers.</b> The <b>resistance</b> plasmids were also checked for the presence of RepHI 1 A replicon. Results: All <b>resistance</b> <b>markers</b> were found to be transferred to the recipient through conjugation and transformation, except for nalidixic acid. None of the resistance plasmid was found to harbour RepHI 1 A replicon and therefore, did not belong to incompatibility group IncHI 1. <b>Resistance</b> <b>markers</b> were found to be highly stable in all the isolates during serial passages and storage as stab cultures at different temperatures for different time periods. Interpretation & conclusions: <b>Resistance</b> <b>markers</b> for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, streptomycin and trimethoprim were transferred through conjugation as well as transformation whereas that for nalidixic acid was not transferred in any of the isolates. Markers for chloramphenicol and streptomycin resistance were found to be most stable during various storage conditions. Presence of small-sized non-IncHI 1 resistance plasmids is a matter of concern due to their capability to exist inside the host, thereby increasing the possibility of their transmission and spread among S.

40|$|The {{use of a}} nonlethal {{selection}} scheme, {{most often}} using the aadA gene that confers resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin, has been considered critical for recovery of plastid transformation events. In this study, the plastid-lethal markers, glyphosate or phosphinothricin herbicides, were used to develop a selection scheme for plastids that circumvents the need for integration of an antibiotic <b>resistance</b> <b>marker.</b> The effect of selective agents on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) mesophyll chloroplasts was first examined by transmission electron microscopy. We found that at concentrations typically used for selection of nuclear transformants, herbicides caused rapid disintegration of plastid membranes, whereas antibiotics had no apparent effect. To overcome this apparent herbicide lethality to plastids, a “transformation segregation” scheme was developed that used two independent transformation vectors for a cotransformation approach and two different selective agents in a phased selection scheme. One transformation vector carried an antibiotic resistance (aadA) marker used for early nonlethal selection, and the other transformation vector carried the herbicide (CP 4 or bar) <b>resistance</b> <b>marker</b> {{for use in a}} subsequent lethal selection phase. Because the two markers were carried on separate plasmids and were targeted to different locations on the plastid genome, we reasoned that segregation of the two markers in some transplastomic lines could occur. We report here a plastid cotransformation frequency of 50 % to 64 %, with a high frequency (20 %) of these giving rise to transformation segregants containing exclusively the initially nonselected herbicide <b>resistance</b> <b>marker.</b> Our studies indicate a high degree of persistence of unselected transforming DNA, providing useful insights into plastid chromosome dynamics...|$|E
