40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of several {{pieces of legislation}} mandating minimum and maximum retention periods for corporate records has prompted the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) community to develop various <b>records</b> <b>retention</b> solutions. <b>Records</b> <b>retention</b> is a significant subfield of records management, and legal <b>records</b> <b>retention</b> requirements apply over corporate records regardless of their shape or form. Unfortunately, the scope of existing solutions has been largely limited to proper identification, classification and retention of documents, and not of data more generally.

However, in the world of relational databases there is no standardized notion of a business <b>record</b> and its <b>retention</b> obligations. Unlike physical documents such as forms and reports, information in databases is organized such that one item of data may be part of various legal records and consequently subject to several (and possibly conflicting) retention policies. This thesis proposes a framework for <b>records</b> <b>retention</b> in relational database systems. It presents a mech...|$|R
