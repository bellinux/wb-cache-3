40|$|AbstractCompressibility {{effects on}} Rayleigh–Taylor {{instability}} in inhomogeneous plasma rotating uniformly in an external vertical magnetic field have been investigated. Using the exponential density distribution {{and in the}} presence of a fixed boundary condition, the linear growth rate is obtained for a finite compressible plasma layer. As well as the linear growth rate of a heavy compressible plasma layer supported by a lighter one is obtained. It is shown that, in the case of a finite compressible plasma layer and in the absence of an external magnetic field the system is always instable, while {{in the presence of}} an external magnetic field the system capitulates to the stability role that plays it. In the case of two compressible plasma layers, the compressibility (the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> values) has a stabilizing role that increases with the presence of an external vertical magnetic field.

40|$|In {{an actual}} engine system, one {{mechanism}} for production of hot spots is {{the burning of}} various fluid elements at various different mixture ratios. Variable mixture ratio means variable temperature, {{and this is the}} effect that has been studied insofar as a noise source is concerned. However, variable mixture ratio also implies variable molecular weight and heat capacity. The paper investigates whether either of these last two variations may be responsible for a significant noise source. The analysis is made within the context of one-dimensional unsteady flow as in the work of Candel (1972). A mixture of thermally perfect gases is assumed as the working fluid, and the fluid composition consists of species 1 and a small and variable mole fraction of species 2 which has different molecular weight and specific heats as compared with species 1. In the absence of changes in the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> (gamma), the entropy variations due to temperature and molecular weight variations are equivalent as a sound source.

30|$|However, large {{vertical}} motions {{around the}} epicenter can generate acoustic (pressure) waves and gravity (buoyancy) waves (i.e. AGWs) in the neutral atmosphere, which can further propagate into the ionosphere {{and interact with}} the ionized gas. The highly-fluctuated features indicate these waves with various amplitudes, frequencies, and speeds confoundedly/concurrently reaching the ionosphere. The AGW speed {{is a function of}} the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>specific</b> <b>heat,</b> temperature, molecular weight, wind speed, etc. For those traveling below the mesopause of 90 km altitude, the average AGW speeds are about 300 – 400 m/s (Liu et al., 2006), while for those departing with relatively high elevation angles and mainly traveling in the ionosphere (or thermo-sphere) above 100 km altitude, the associated average AGW speeds could be up to 700 – 1100 m/s (cf. Artru et al., 2004; Heki and Ping, 2005; Liu et al., 2010). Therefore, the speed of 900 m/s suggests the 2 nd STID being related to AGWs mainly traveling in the ionosphere of about 200 km altitude, which is close to the value of 1032 – 1045 m/s given by Liu et al. (2011) and the 1 km/s (1000 m/s) given by Rolland et al. (2011).|$|E

40|$|Now, in {{existing}} wind tunnels, using a horsepower of 100 to 300, the models are generally {{made to a}} 1 / 10 scale and the speed is appreciably lower than the speeds currently attained by airplanes. The Reynolds number realized is thus 15 to 25 times smaller than that reached by airplanes in free flight, while the ratio of speed to the velocity of sound is between a third and {{three quarters of the}} true ratio. The necessary increases in either the diameter of the wind tunnel or the velocity of the airstream are too costly.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the 3 D resistive tearing instability in a magnetotail configuration {{by means of}} a resistive MHD code for various forms of the energy equation, including ohmic and compressional heating. A complete derivation of the set of MHD equations from a kinetic formalism is presented, with all simplifying assumptions noted. Emphasis is placed on the changes in magnetotail evolution caused by a variation of the assumed value of the polytropic exponent gamma, representing the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> in the energy equation which closes the set of MHD equations. Within the gamma range of 2 / 3 - 4, a tearing mode is found to develop in all cases. Certain properties, such as the formation and ejection of a plasmoid, associated with the formation of the reversal region of the north-south component of the magnetic field, and strong earthward and tailward flow fields prevail as qualitative features independent of the value of gamma chosen.
