They are usually carried [...] "side slung", clipped {{on either side}} of the diver to the harness of the backplate and wing or buoyancy compensator, rather than on the back, and may be left on the distance line to be picked up for use on return (stage dropped). Commonly divers use aluminium stage cylinders, particularly in fresh water, because they are nearly neutrally buoyant in water and can be removed underwater with less effect on the diver's overall buoyancy.|$|E

500|$|A {{study in}} the Baltic region showed that {{northern}} goldcrests {{were more likely to}} migrate, and increased their body mass beforehand; non-migratory southern birds did not increase their fat <b>reserves.</b> The <b>travel</b> speed of migrating goldcrests increased for those leaving later in the autumn, and was greater for the northernmost populations. Migration was faster on routes that crossed the Baltic Sea than on coastal routes, and the birds with the largest fat <b>reserves</b> <b>travelled</b> at the highest speeds. The ability to lay down fat is adversely affected in this tiny bird by poor health. In Hungary, goldcrests stopping temporarily on migration were mostly found in scrub, including blackthorn, hawthorn and pear, which provided some protection from sparrowhawks. Females migrated slightly earlier than males, but overall there were more males, with an average sex ratio of 1.6:1. Goldcrests can fly [...] in one day, although they keep at a lower level in heavy headwinds. This is a tame and inquisitive bird, and tired migrants will land near or on humans, sometimes searching for food on their clothing.|$|R
