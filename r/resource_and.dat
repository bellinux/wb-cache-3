Due to the geographic layout of the valleys, land was a scarce <b>resource,</b> <b>and</b> therefore leisure activities that took up little space, time and money were sought. This saw the popularity of activities such as greyhound races, cockfighting, open air handball courts (often attached to a public house), boxing booths, foot racing and rugby union.|$|E
5|$|More than 40years {{before the}} {{creation}} of the National Park Service, Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872, as the world's first national park. Between 1872 and 1886, the park was administered by the Interior Department and was managed by a civilian superintendent with limited resources or legal authority to maintain and protect the park's natural features and wildlife, or to deal with poaching, vandalism and other destructive activities. Over the next decade, special interest groups such as concessionaires, railroad and mining interests attempted to commercialize and privatize park lands. The poorly funded Interior Department was unable to prevent degradation of the park and in some circumstances, was complicit with special interest groups. Senator George Vest led efforts to prevent railroads and other special interests from misusing the <b>resource,</b> <b>and</b> along with other members of Congress believed that only the military could effectively protect the park. A study of the situation and amendments to the Yellowstone Park Act proposed by Senator Vest resulted in the Sundry Civil Appropriations Bill of 1883 which allowed the Interior Department to transfer control of the park to the War Department, thereby protecting Yellowstone from schemes to commercialize the park.|$|E

This paper presents an evaluation index system for <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> environment carrying capacity based on four aspects of carrying capacity (i. e., water resources, land <b>resources,</b> the environment, <b>and</b> ecosystems) by using a square deviation decision- making method, and {{on the basis of}} above effort evaluates the <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> environment carrying capacity across 31 provincial regions in China (not including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan regions of China). In addition, this paper evaluates the current state of socio-economic development, and analyzes the spatial distribution of <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> environment pressure. The results showed that distinct spatial differences in <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> environment carrying capacity and pressure across provincial regions. <b>Resources</b> <b>and</b> environment pressure is affected by both comprehensive <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> environment carrying capacity and socio-economic development. Regions subjected to lower degrees of <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> environment pressure will be restricted by <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> environmental problems through future courses of development owing to excessively low carrying capacities. By contrast, regions with higher comprehensive <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> environment carrying capacity will be subjected to excessively high levels of <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> environment pressure because of rapid socio-economic development. Both of <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> environment carrying capacity and pressure must therefore be considered in the allocation of country-binding targets to provincial regions...|$|R
