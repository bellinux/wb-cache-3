40|$|Environmental, political. and {{socioeconomic}} actions {{over the past}} several years have resulted in a decreased wood supply at a time when there is an increased demand for forest products. This combination of increased demand and decreased supply has forced more emphasis on engineered wood products, a varied category usually connected with adhesively-bonded end joints, of which the most common type is the finger joint. This paper presents the results of a finite-element analysis of structural finger joints, and focuses primarily on the effect of adhesive stiffness and thickness on stress distribution patterns in finger joints. Results indicate that a flexible adhesive layer concentrates adherend longitudinal and <b>radial</b> <b>stresses</b> at the finger base. whereas a stiff adhesive layer minim = adherend stresses but increases adhesive stress levels. Results also show that a thin adhesive layer concentrates longitudinal adherend stresses at the juncture of the finger tip and flexible finger base and concentrates <b>radial</b> <b>stresses</b> at all finger bases. However, these increased longitudinal and <b>radial</b> <b>stresses</b> are balanced by reduced adhesive shear stresses.

40|$|An {{instrumented}} model pile {{was used}} to investigate the fundamental behaviour in clay soils of driven cylindrical steel piles used for offshore structures. Four test-bed sites were chosen; two in stiff heavily consolidated clays, and two in normally/lightly overconsolidated clays. Data from these sites confirm that a residual shear surface is formed along the pile during installation, the location of which relative to the shaft surface appears {{to depend on the}} shaft roughness. Comparisons with other site investigation data and cavity expansion theoretical predictions indicate that stress relief immediately behind the pile tip during driving gives rise to total <b>radial</b> <b>stresses</b> and pore pressures measured on the pile shaft which are lower than predicted. This stress relief is particulary severe in the stiffer clays. The data did however show that the installation total <b>radial</b> <b>stresses</b> and pore pressures are governed by the initial in-situ stresses and undrained shear strength as is predicated by the theory. During reconsolidation, pore pressures close to the instrument rise initially in all clays, and <b>radial</b> effective <b>stresses</b> drop. The slow recovery in <b>radial</b> effective <b>stress</b> during the later stages of reconsolidation was in some cases insufficient to return it to levels recorded during installation. However, the generation of negative pore pressures during undrained loading increased the <b>radial</b> effective <b>stress</b> and shaft friction at failure. This effect is particularly important in the normally consolidated clays, and is responsible for the set-up of shaft capacity seen in such clays, which might not be observed if the loading were drained. The observed behaviour was therefore quite different from the monotonic increase in <b>radial</b> effective <b>stress</b> during reconsolidation, followed by decrease during undrained loading which was expected from a review of current theory...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe present article aims to {{investigate}} the contribution of hygroscopic expansion of flax fibres to interfacial <b>radial</b> <b>stresses</b> and Interfacial Shear Strength (IFSS) of Maleic Anhydride grafted Polypropylene (MAPP) /Flax biocomposites. During manufacturing of thermoplastic biocomposites and storage at 50 % RH, a weight variation is observed, attributed to water content evolution within plant cell-walls. The hygroscopic radial expansion coefficient beta r (flax) of single flax fibres estimated by Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) observation is many orders of magnitude higher (beta(f,R) = 1. 14 s/Delta m) than thermal expansion (alpha(f,R) = 78 10 (- 6) epsilon/degrees C). Thus, its contribution {{to the development of}} residual stresses sigma(rad) during processing should be prevalent.

50|$|Sheet {{fractures}} are arcuate fractures defining {{slabs of}} rock {{that range from}} 0.5 to 10 meters thick. They normally form in sets parallel to the Earth’s surface but may form in convex-upward or concave-upward sets. There are several possible explanations {{for the formation of}} sheet fractures. The most popular hypothesis is that they are the result of expansion and tangential fracturing consequent on erosional offloading or pressure release. There is evidence that supports this hypothesis when looking at granitic landforms that have sheet fractures. Granite forms deep in the Earth’s crust under conditions of high ambient or lithostatic pressure. In order for the granite to be exposed at the Earth’s surface a considerable thickness of rock must be eroded. This unloading allows the granite to expand radially and sheet fractures form tangentially to the <b>radial</b> <b>stress.</b> This indicates that the shape of the pre-existing land surface determines the geometry of the sheet fractures.|$|E
