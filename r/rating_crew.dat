State highway agencies (SHAs) collect data on historical bids and/or production <b>rates,</b> <b>crew</b> sizes and mixes, material costs, and equipment costs, including contractor overhead and profit. The goal of this synthesis is to identify how state highway agencies develop unit prices for construction and maintenance projects. The synthesis approach consists of a comprehensive online survey, covering every aspect of unit cost development, to identify the state of practice in state highway agencies and interviews with several representative SHAs to gain a better understanding of the practices followed for unit cost development. This study finds that even though SHAs collect and store historical cost data, they do not have a formal and documented process for adjusting unit costs for project characteristics and market conditions. 17.

The pilot's responsibilities include his or her opinions on what safety issues could have had an adverse impact on their operations.

The objective of this research is to create a framework to define a standardized and a systematic approach for developing unit costs for construction project estimating. A literature review was conducted that provided an overview of estimating techniques used in project estimating, estimation guidelines maintained by SHAs, and information systems used in the estimation process. After gaining a broad overview of the industry?s approach to unit cost development, a survey was then conducted. The purpose of the survey was to identify the state of practice in SHAs for unit cost development. The survey helped to identify SHAs doing considerable work in unit cost development and interviews were conducted with these agencies to know their unit cost development process in detail. The results from survey and the interviews were then used in defining the framework.

40|$|The Province of British Columbia forest tenure {{licensing}} practices {{require the}} replanting of tree seedlings {{in the place}} of logged forest. Reforestation is presently done manually by individual tree planters. Currently {{there is a shortage of}} skilled tree planting labour in Western Canada. This shortage will be exacerbated as the millions of hectares of dead lodgepole pine forests in British Columbia's Central Interior continue to be harvested in the wake of the mountain pine beetle epidemic. Mechanized planting provides a possible solution to this problem. This method has been applied successfully in the agriculture sector and attempted in forestry. Presently in Western Canada no commercially viable automated reforestation is taking place. Research into mechanized conifer transplanting techniques introduced thus far show low productivity and high operating expenses. This paper investigates current manual and automated planting methods for seedling planting quality, growth rates and transplanting costs. In order to contribute to design criteria and assess the commercial prospects of mechanized reforestation equipment in British Columbia's Central Interior, estimates of a machine's minimum planting <b>rate,</b> <b>crew</b> size and equipment configuration will be made. From these specification an initial capital investment in equipment is forecast and projections of operating costs determined. [...] P. ii.

40|$|Crew {{coordination}} in {{the context}} of aviation is a specifically choreographed set of tasks performed by each pilot, defined for each phase of flight. Based on the constructs of effective Crew Resource Management and SOPs for each phase of flight, a shared understanding of crew workload and task responsibility is considered representative of well-coordinated crews. Nominal behavior is therefore defined by SOPs and CRM theory, detectable through pilot eye-scan. This research investigates the relationship between the eye-scan exhibited by each pilot and the level of coordination between crewmembers. Crew coordination was evaluated based on each pilot 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the other crewmember 2 ̆ 7 s workload. By contrasting each pilot 2 ̆ 7 s workload-understanding, crew coordination was measured as the summed absolute difference of each pilot 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the other crewmember 2 ̆ 7 s reported workload, resulting in a crew coordination index. The <b>crew</b> coordination index <b>rates</b> <b>crew</b> coordination on a scale ranging across Excellent, Good, Fair and Poor. Eye-scan behavior metrics were found to reliably identify a reduction in crew coordination. Additionally, crew coordination was successfully characterized by eye-scan behavior data using machine learning classification methods. Identifying eye-scan behaviors on the flight deck indicative of reduced crew coordination can be used to inform training programs and design enhanced avionics that improve the overall coordination between the crewmembers and the flight deck interface. Additionally, characterization of crew coordination can be used to develop methods to increase shared situation awareness and crew coordination to reduce operational and flight technical errors. Ultimately, the ability to reduce operational and flight technical errors made by pilot crews improves the safety of aviation...|$|R
