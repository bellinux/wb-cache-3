The inner surface of each fish slice is dusted with mung bean starch, the filling is placed on it and it is then folded in half and sealed. The edges of the dumplings are trimmed with kitchen scissors to create the half-moon shapes.

This paper estimates first and second order elasticities of a Translog approximation of a Stochastic Distance Functions of multiple outputs assuming time unvarying technical efficiency in order to get this aim. The evidences that sea surface temperatures have influence on growth and maturation and on the development of hermaphroditic gonads of different kinds of seabream support the consideration of sea surface temperatures as an approximation of the variability of marine environment conditions. Additionally, the growth pattern of <b>red</b> <b>seabream</b> provides meaningful information of this fish species that justifies looking in the relation between landings or <b>red</b> <b>seabream</b> abundance, and sea surface temperatures during spring with a lag of no less than two seasons.

Fish (1. 46 ± 0. 001 g) were fed four isonitrogenous and isocaloric experimental diets containing 0. 7 or 1. 4 % phenylalanine either in free or dipeptide form. A feeding trial was carried out in three replicates and the fish were fed to apparent satiation for six weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, feed intake of fish was influenced by both phenylalanine form and level and significantly higher values were obtained at an inclusion level of 0. 7 % and by the use of dipeptide form. However, the other growth parameters did not significantly differ among treatments. Whole-body amino acid compositions revealed no significant changes in concentrations of both essential and non-essential amino acids regardless of the increase in phenylalanine levels or the use of its different forms.

The objectives were to observe the morphological changes of <b>red</b> <b>seabream</b> (Pagrus major) embryo during the cooling-thawing process, and to examine the effect of cryoprotectant and cooling rate on the temperatures of oil globule ice formation (T-OIF), extra-cellular ice formation (T-EIF) and intracellular ice formation (T-IIF) using cryomicroscope. After thawing, the morphological changes of embryos were observed and recorded by the video attachment and monitor under the microscope. During the cooling process, three representative phenomena were observed: oil globule gradually turned bright firstly, then the whole field of view flashed and the embryo blackened. Cooling rate affect the temperature of both extra- and intra-cellular ice formations. T-EIF and T-IIF at high cooling rate were much lower than that at low cooling rate. And the value of T-EIF - T-IIF increased from 0. 45 to 11. 11 degrees C with the increase of cooling rate from 3 to 130 degrees C/min.

The volumetric removal rates of total ammonia nitrogen by SF, PF, and KF were 193. 8, 183. 9, and 142. 6 g m- 3 day- 1, respectively, and those of nitrite nitrogen (NO 2 -N) were 113. 4, 105. 9, and 85. 8 g m- 3 day- 1, respectively. The TAN and NO 2 -N removal rates of KF were {{lower than those of}} SF and PF (P 0. 05). Among the biofilters used, only KF showed total suspended solid (TSS) removal capacity. The TSS removal efficiencies of SF and PF were negative. The growth rates of fish in SF were significantly higher than those in KF but not higher than those in PF. There was no difference in growth rate between fish in PF and KF. The specific growth rate and feed conversion efficiency of red seabreams in KF were lower than those in SF and PF, but {{there were no significant differences}} between SF and PF.

A cDNA clone encoding P 450 arom is 1779 base pairs in length and encodes a protein of 519 amino acids in length, with a calculated molecular weight of 58. 9 kDa. North-ern blot analysis showed that P 450 arom mRNA levels increased gradually from Day 8, when oocytes reached the secondary yolk globule stage, and were maintained at high levels at the day of spawning (Day 15). The P 450 arom mRNA levels increased in as-sociation with an increase of the gonadosomatic index (gonad weight/body weight 3 100 %), serum E 2, and P 450 arom enzyme activity (in vitro conversion of testosterone to E 2 in the ovarian fragments). Furthermore, an increase in mRNA levels of the LHb, but not FSHb, correlated with increased P 450 arom mRNA levels {{during the course of}} ovarian development.

40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{composition of}} fish eggs {{is often used}} as an indicator for assessing the nutritional requirements of aquaculture species during their larval stages. Fatty acids of the (n- 3) HUFA type have proven to {{play a critical role}} in providing good growth, survival and stress resistance in marine fish larvae. Hence, analyzing these fatty acids in fish eggs may provide interesting data on the requirements for those essential nutrients. By comparing the analyses of wild versus broodstock fish eggs differences may appear, possibly explaining differences in egg quality. Intra-spawning-season differences may further appear by following fatty acid profiles in the course of time. Finally, the influence of broodstock nutritionon egg composition may be another variable to consider in the evaluation of the above. In this study freshly released eggs of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), seabream (Sparus aurata), and <b>red</b> <b>seabream</b> (Pagrus major) were collected from broodstock fish held under different conditions in various hatcheries. Temporal variations in fatty acid profiles were monitored by following a seabream broodstock during 1 month.
