50|$|Advantages: As {{opposed to}} all other types of hot mix, PFC is {{designed}} to let water drain through the mixture into the underlying layer. PFC mixtures significantly reduce water spray, improve wet weather visibility and visibility of pavement markings, significantly reduce tire noise, and restore ride quality. PFC mixtures have stone on stone contact and relatively high amounts of asphalt binder. As a result, they offer good <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>rutting</b> and cracking. PFC mixtures are relatively easy to design and place. PFC mixtures require only a minimal amount of compaction with a static roller. This helps facilitate a smooth riding surface. PFC mixtures provide for a roadway that has a uniform yet coarse surface texture. The coarse texture and permeable mix characteristics improve wet weather traction.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Road {{authority}} {{specifications for}} unbound granular materials (UGMs) do not typically include a direct measure of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>rutting</b> caused by repeated loading yet. These specifications can preclude {{the use of}} locally available aggregates or recycled materials that may provide adequate performance (<b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>rutting).</b> As an alternative or compliment to current UGM assessment methods via specifications, a serviceability design method is proposed that utilises results from tests in the repeated load tri-axial (RLT) apparatus. Permanent strain behaviour at a range of stress conditions of four unbound granular materials (UGM) were assessed in the RLT apparatus. Behaviour was categorised into 3 possible ranges A, B or C, where A is a stable response and C is incremental collapse while B is intermediate. From this data, test stresses near or at the boundary of range A and B were determined to define a serviceability limit line stress boundary in p (mean normal stress) – q (principle stress difference) stress space. The serviceability limit line was applied as a yield criteria in a finite element model of a pavement to predict whether or not stable (Range A) behaviour occurs in the UGM {{for a range of}} asphalt cover thicknesses...|$|E

The Iowa Department of Transportation has required 85 % crushed particles and 75 -blow Marshall mix design in an effort to prevent rutting on Interstate roadways. Relationships between the percent of crushed particles and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>rutting</b> in pavement through the use of various laboratory test procedures must be developed.

These aggregate combinations were used with 4, 5, and 6 % asphalt cement (ac). Laboratory tests included Marshall stability, resilient modulus, indirect tensile, and creep. A creep resistance factor (CRF) was developed to provide a single numeric value for creep test results. The CRF values relate well to the amount of crushed particles and the perceived <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>rutting.</b> The indirect tensile test is highly dependent on the ac with a small effect from the percent of crushed particles.

In 2003, Shanxi Province in the North China region collaborated with a Japanese company to construct an 18 -km drainage asphalt pavement in Xi’an airport highway. It was China’s first large-scale use of drainage asphalt roadbed, and good engineering applications have been found. TPS was imported from a Japanese company [7].

40|$|The global {{desire to}} move toward {{sustainable}} transportation systems encouraged road authorities to adopt warm-mix asphalt technologies and {{to increase the amount}} of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) in asphalt mixtures. The reduction of mixing and compaction temperatures through the adoption of specific additives has exhibited several downsides, including low <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> high temperatures (<b>rutting),</b> incomplete drying of the aggregates, moisture damage, and low durability. However, high RAP percentages provided aging of the asphalt binder, variability in the aggregate gradation and asphalt binder content, and some limitations during plant production.

A new compound of a polymer-modified and fiber-reinforced system was added to provide comparable performance with respect to polymer-modified hot mixes. The laboratory study evaluated the influence of mixing and compaction temperatures, compaction properties, dynamic modulus and master curves, fatigue behavior, and rutting resistance, among other things. Results showed that warm-mix technologies could be adopted together with high RAP percentages and provide consistent performance in durability similar to that attributed to polymer-modified hot mixes.

It was difficult to achieve the Superpave volumetric requirements of voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) and voids filled with asphalt (VFA) at 4 percent air voids, regardless of the gradation. A target air void content of 3 percent satisfied the VFA requirement, even though the VMA requirement could not be fulfilled.

The addition of hydrated lime to asphalt has shown to be beneficial with an improvement in the Theological properties of the binder, as well as resistance to permanent deformation (rutting) and fatigue cracking of asphalt concrete mixtures. The addition of hydrated lime produces a filler effect where the result is a stiffening of the asphalt mixture, thus improving the resistance to permanent deformation. The fatigue characteristics of the asphalt mixtures did not worsen from this stiffening effect, but were either improved or similar. The Superpave Performance Grade was not significantly indicative of the filler effects induced by the hydrated lime. However, evaluation of the physical properties, G*/sin 5 and G*sin 5 were indicative of significant filler effects induced by the hydrated lime. Creep properties, stiffness and m-value showed no substantial change with the addition of lime. The use of 10 to 20 % mass concentration of hydrated lime can effectively improve the rutting resistance of the unaged and aged binder with little practical effect on the low temperature and fatigue properties. The filler effects produced through the addition of hydrated lime to the asphalt yielded asphalt mixtures less susceptible to rutting. In most cases, the fatigue life of the asphalt mixtures improved as well. The reference modulus and creep compliance of the asphalt mixtures with lime had shown to have greater fatigue life. In most cases, Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) mixtures with lime showed greater <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>rutting,</b> as well as greater fatigue life. The filler effects from the hydrated lime, as well as the stone-on-stone contact and stiffening from the mastic (two characteristics of SMA mixtures) improved these properties. The addition of hydrated lime to asphalt improved the G*/sin 5 and G*sin 8 of the asphalt binders. The use of these asphalt binders in asphalt concrete mixtures increased the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>rutting</b> and fatigue life.
