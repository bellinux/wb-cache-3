Because endotracheal suction in these patients is essential, chest physiotherapy techniques such as expiratory <b>rib</b> cage <b>compression</b> before endotracheal suctioning can be used as a means to facilitate mobilizing and removing airway secretion and improving alveolar ventilation. As one of the complications of mechanical ventilation and endotracheal suctioning is decrease of cardiac output, this study was carried out to determine the effect of expiratory <b>rib</b> cage <b>compression</b> before endotracheal suctioning on the vital signs in patients under mechanical ventilation. Materials and Methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial with a crossover design. The study subjects included 50 mechanically ventilated patients, hospitalized in intensive care wards of Valiasr and Mousavi hospitals in Zanjan, Iran.

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the most}} common ways put into {{practice}} to the clearance of the airway of patients who are under mechanical ventilation is applying suctioning into trachea. Some physiotherapeutic procedures including <b>rib</b> cage <b>compression</b> parallel to exhale and prior to suctioning can facilitate the egression of discharges. The present study aimed to determine the effect of <b>rib</b> cage <b>compression</b> during the exhale before suctioning on O 2 saturation changes in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Methodology: The research is a clinical trial study. The sample involved 55 patients who received mechanical ventilation hospitalized in special sections of health centers at Golestan and Emam-Khomeini hospitals in Ahvaz. The patients were divided into control and intervention groups by convenience sampling as paying attention to random involvement criteria. Blood oxygen saturation, within 5 minutes before and 15 and 25 minutes after suctioning were measured for intervention group using <b>rib</b> cage <b>compression</b> technique and the data were analyzed by independent t-test, and paired t-test as well as repeated measures design. Findings: The level of oxygen saturation increased by the trachea suctioning through <b>rib</b> cage <b>compression</b> technique and it is statistically meaningful at p< 0. 05. Conclusion: With respect to the improvement of blood oxygen saturation in intervention group, the technique is recommended for intubed patients.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss the classification, diagnosis, pathophysiology and management of Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a complex entity that is characterized by different neurovascular signs and symptoms involving the upper limb. TOS is defined as upper extremity symptoms due to compression of the neurovascular bundle in the area of the neck just above the first <b>rib.</b> <b>Compression</b> is thought to occur at one or more of the three anatomical compartments: the interscalene triangle, the costoclavicular space and the retropectoralis minor spaces. The clinical presentation can include both neurogenic and vascular symptoms. TOS can be difficult to diagnose because there is no standardized objective test that can be used and the clinician must rely on history and several positive findings on physical exam. The medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve conduction may be a sensitive way to detect pathology in the lower trunks of the brachial plexus which is promising for future research. Treatment options continue to be conservative and surgical. However, for those who have failed physical therapy there is research to suggest that botulinum toxin may help with symptom relief.

Post-fetch decompression, in which decompression is performed after the compressed instructions have been fetched, allows the instruction cache to store compressed code but requires a highly efficient decompression implementation. We propose implementing post-fetch decompression using dynamic instruction stream editing (DISE), a programmable decoder [...] -similar in structure to those in many IA 32 processors [...] -that is used to add functionality to an application by injecting custom code snippets into its fetched instruction stream. A DISE implementation of post-fetch decompression naturally supports customized program-specific decompression dictionaries, enables parameterized decompression allowing similar instruction sequences to share dictionary entries, and uses no decompression-specific hardware. Cycle-level simulation of DISE decompression shows that it can reduce static program size by 35 % and execution time by 20 %. Parameterized decompression, a feature unique to DISE, accounts for 20 % of the code size reduction by making more effective use of the dictionary and allowing PC-relative branches {{to be included in}} compressed sequences.

The method of compression is strikingly similar to the previously published Color Cell Compression, which is in turn an adaptation of Block Truncation Coding published in the late 1970s. Unlike some image compression algorithms (e.g. JPEG), S3TC's fixed-rate data <b>compression</b> <b>coupled</b> with the single memory access (cf. Color Cell Compression and some VQ-based schemes) made it well-suited for use in compressing textures in hardware-accelerated 3D computer graphics. Its subsequent inclusion in Microsoft's DirectX 6.0 and OpenGL 1.3 (via the GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc extension) led to widespread adoption of the technology among hardware and software makers. While S3 Graphics is no longer a competitor in the graphics accelerator market, license fees are still levied and collected for the use of S3TC technology, for example in game consoles and graphics cards. The wide use of S3TC has led to a de facto requirement for OpenGL drivers to support it, but the patent-encumbered status of S3TC presents a major obstacle to open source implementations, while implementation approaches which try to avoid the patented parts exist.|$|R

Estimation of {{intracranial}} {{stress distribution}} caused by mass effect {{is critical to}} the management of hemorrhagic stroke or brain tumor patients, who may suffer severe secondary brain injury from brain tissue <b>compression.</b> <b>Coupling</b> with physiological parameters that are readily available using MRI, eg, tissue perfusion, a non-invasive, quantitative and regional estimation of intracranial stress distribution could offer a better understanding of brain tissue’s reaction under mass effect. A quantitative and sound measurement serving this particular purpose remains elusive due to multiple challenges associated with biomechanical modeling of the brain. One such challenge for the conventional Lagrangian frame based finite element method (LFEM) is that the mesh distortion resulted from the expansion of the mass effects can terminate the simulation prematurely before the desired pressure loading is achieved. In this work, we adopted an arbitrary Lagrangian and Eulerian FEM method (ALEF) with explicit dynamic solutions to simulate the expansion of brain mass effects caused by a pressure loading. This approach consists of three phases: 1) a Lagrangian phase to deform mesh like LFEM, 2) a mesh smoothing phase to reduce mesh distortion, and 3) an Eulerian phase to map the state variables from the old mesh to the smoothed one. In 2 D simulations with simulated geometries, this approach is able to model substantially larger deformations compared to LFEM.
