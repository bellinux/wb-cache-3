40|$|The Emergency Medical Service (EMS) in Oslo has {{insufficient}} routines for {{surveillance of}} the medical activity, beyond the number of ambulance missions and response times. Norwegian authorities lack regular <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about important quantitative and qualitative aspects of the EMS. Documentation is necessary to evaluate the EMS, {{to improve the quality}} and to calculate the dimension of the service. We therefore analysed the case-records, from the emergency runs, carried out by the EMS in Oslo September 2002. A study like this has not previously been published in Norway. The study of 1945 case-records shows that the ambulance missions were quite equally divided among the EMS’ three work shifts. If our results are representative of all the 12 months in 2002, they indicate that the need for EMS preparedness in general is the same day and night. The paramedics looked after 338 patients who didn’t need any further medical emergency treatment, thus the paramedics often performed independent clinical judgement. Our results indicate that the personnel working on the anaesthesiologist-manned ambulance follow the treatment regulations to a higher extent than the paramedics on the other ambulances. It seems that the staff working in the dispatch centre give preference to the physician-manned-ambulance to patients with diffuse and severe conditions, especially out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The results support the need for regular <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> that enhances comparison between the information registered by the dispatch centre and the case-reports.

40|$|Theoretical {{positions}} {{concerning the}} role of the orienting response (OR) in information-processing and attention have viewed the OR either as indexing an active increase in information-processing efficiency, or as passively reflecting the results of information processing. This paper reports a skin conductance response (SCR) study of a two-stimulus anticipation experiment, where a warning stimulus (WS) informed subjects of the nature of an impending imperative stimulus (IS). The subjects' task was to identify as much of the IS as possible. Both the WS and the IS varied in information content and stimulus duration. SCR magnitude in the WS-IS interval varied according to the anticipated information processing requirements and was more sensitive to IS variation than WS variation. It is concluded that these responses index an anticipatory, activating process closely related to that suggested of the OR by Sokolov (1966), and consonant with the functional characteristics of the autonomic nervous system. <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> appears to be neither a necessary determinant of OR magnitude, nor a parsimoniously useful part of OR theory. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The new method is based on simultaneous <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> by the standard digital speckle interferometry method and registration of distribution of intensity in the single speckle. Such decision allows to investigate fracture processes in real time; to increase sensitivity and accuracy of measurements; to expand a range of measured displacements. Besides, an offered method of the analysis of distribution of intensity in the single speckle allows will get rid of own noise inherent of interferometric methods of coherent optics. In work theoretical and experimental results on realization of an offered method are presented.

40|$|An {{approach}} for extensible ontological model construction in a mediation environment intended for heterogeneous information sources integration in various subject domains is presented. A mediator ontological language (MOL) {{may depend on}} a subject domain and is to be defined at the mediator consolidation phase. On the other hand, for different information sources different ontological models (languages) {{can be used to}} define their own ontologies. Reversible mapping of the source ontological models into MOL is needed for information sources registration at the mediator. An {{approach for}} such reversible mapping is demonstrated for a class of the Web information sources. It is assumed that such sources apply the DAML+OIL ontological model. A subset of the hybrid object-oriented and semi-structured canonical mediator data model is used for the core of MOL. Construction of a reversible mapping of DAML+OIL into an extension of the core of MOL is presented in the paper. Such mapping is a necessary pre-requisite for contextualizing and <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> sources at the mediator. The mapping shows how extensible MOL can be constructed.
