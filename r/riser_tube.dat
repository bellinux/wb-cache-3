The {{first of two}} major design challenges is to predict the performance of all the thermal-fluid components on the system level {{and the second is}} to predict the performance of the integrated plant consisting of all its sub-systems.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this project was to develop and {{validate}} new classes of cost-effective low-permeability ceramic and refractory components for handling molten aluminum in both melting and casting environments. Three approaches were employed with partial to full success to achieve this goal: (1) Develop materials and methods for sealing surface porosity in thermal-shock-resistant ceramic refractories; (2) Develop new ceramic coatings for extreme service in molten aluminum operations, with particular emphasis on coatings based on highly stable oxide phases; and (3) Develop new monolithic refractories designed for lower-permeability applications using controlled porosity gradients and particle size distributions. The results of the research work and the field tests performed utilizing these three approaches are listed below: (1) It was demonstrated that high-density IR heating could be a tool for altering and sealing the surface porosity of fused silica. However, the process was not very cost-effective. (2) A low-cost glaze composition having a {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) similar to that of a DFS tube was identified and was successfully tested for its integrity and adherence to DFS. Although the glaze acted as a barrier between the molten aluminum and the DFS, persistent porosity and crazing within the glaze affected its performance during the reactivity tests, thus acting as an obstacle in scaling up production of this glaze. (3) Pyrotek's XL glaze showed great success in improving the life of the DFS tubes. Pyrotek has reported an increasing market demand for the XL-coated DFS tubes, which exhibit useful lifetimes three times better than those of uncoated tubes.

During the simulation, three scenarios were simulated, i. e. water ingress into the core only, water ingress into the reflectors only and water ingress into both the core and reflectors.

The movement of the working fluid is appears due to occurrence of the natural pressure, determined by the difference in hydrostatic pressure and the mass of water and water-and-steam mixtures in downcomer and <b>riser</b> <b>tubes</b> and called the driving pressure of the natural circulation: S drive = H steam (ρ down + ρ mix) g where: ρ down - density of water in downcomer tubes; ρ mix - density of water in riser tubes; H steam - height of steam content section; g - acceleration of gravity. In steam boilers with natural circulation the circulation rate is usually between 10 and 30. Thus, consumption of water in the circulation circuit “circulation rate times” more than steam output of the boiler. There are two aspects of the design of natural water circulation loops. One is to ensure a sufficient mass flux of circulating water to avoid burnout of evaporator tubes. The other is to avoid tube wall temperature fluctuation and tube vibration due to oscillation of circulation velocity. The design criteria are therefore reduced, in principle, to those of critical heat flux, critical flow rate for burnout, and flow instability. In practical design, however, the circulation velocity and the void fraction at the evaporator tube outlet are used as the design criteria (Seikan I., et. al., 1999). This study has been made with assumption that the heat flux in the furnace of the boiler even all the time.

40|$|A {{recent review}} by the U. S. Advanced Ceramics Association, the Aluminum Association, and the U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Industrial Technologies (DOE/OIT) {{described}} the status of advanced ceramics for aluminum processing, including monolithics, composites, and coatings. The report observed that monolithic ceramics (particularly oxides) have attractive properties such as resistance to heat, corrosion, thermal shock, abrasion, and erosion [1]. However, even after the developments of the past 25 years, there are two key barriers to commercialization: reliability and cost-effectiveness. Industry research is therefore focused on eliminating these barriers. Ceramic coatings have likewise undergone significant development {{and a variety of}} processes have been demonstrated for applying coatings to substrates. Some processes, such as thermal barrier coatings for gas turbine engines, exhibit sufficient reliability and service life for routine commercial use. Worldwide, aluminum melting and molten metal handling consumes about 506, 000 tons of refractory materials annually. Refractory compositions for handling molten aluminum are generally based on dense fused cast silica or mullite. The microstructural texture is extremely important because an interlocking mass of coarser grains must be bonded together by smaller grains in order to achieve adequate strength. At the same time, well-distributed microscopic pores and cracks are needed to deflect cracks and prevent spalling and thermal shock damage [2]. The focus of this project was to develop and validate new classes of cost-effective, low-permeability ceramic and refractory components for handling molten aluminum in both smelting and casting environments. The primary goal was to develop improved coatings and functionally graded materials that will possess superior combinations of properties, including resistance to thermal shock, erosion, corrosion, and wetting. When these materials are successfully deployed in aluminum smelting and casting operations, their superior performance and durability will give end users marked improvements in uptime, defect reduction, scrap/rework costs, and overall energy savings resulting from higher productivity and yield. The implementation of results of this program will result in energy savings of 30 trillion Btu/year by 2020. For this Industrial Materials for the Future (IMF) project, <b>riser</b> <b>tube</b> used in the low-pressure die (LPD) casting of aluminum was selected as the refractory component for improvement. In this LPD process, a pressurized system is used to transport aluminum metal through refractory tubes (riser tubes) into wheel molds. It is important for the tubes to remain airtight because otherwise, the pressurized system will fail. Generally, defects such as porosity in the tube or cracks generated by reaction of the tube material with molten aluminum lead to tube failure, making the tube incapable of maintaining the pressure difference required for normal casting operation. Therefore, the primary objective of the project was to develop a <b>riser</b> <b>tube</b> that is not only resistant to thermal shock, erosion, corrosion, and wetting, but is also less permeable, so as to achieve longer service life. Currently, the dense-fused silica (DFS) <b>riser</b> <b>tube</b> supplied by Pyrotek lasts for only 7 days before undergoing failure. The following approach was employed to achieve the goal: (1) Develop materials and methods for sealing surface porosity in thermal-shock-resistant ceramic refractories; (2) Develop new ceramic coatings for extreme service in molten aluminum operations, with particular emphasis on coatings based on highly stable oxide phases; (3) Develop new monolithic refractories designed for lower-permeability applications using controlled porosity gradients and particle size distributions; (4) Optimize refractory formulations to minimize wetting by molten aluminum, and characterize erosion, corrosion, and spallation rates under realistic service conditions; and (5) Scale up the processing methods to full-sized components and perform field testing in commercial aluminum casting shops...|$|E

This problem arises in aerodynamics (e. g. turbu-lent flow over the wings and fuselage of airplanes), in off-shore drilling (e. g. water flow around <b>riser</b> <b>tubes</b> transporting oil from the sea bed to the surface), and in the wind engineering of buildings. In each case the primary difficulty arises from the need to calculate turbulent or transitional flow with boundary conditions on complicated domains.

In this paper we propose combining two mathematical approaches to calculate fluid–structure interaction numerically. The first technique, the adaptive wavelet method, tackles the problem of efficiently resolv-ing a high Reynolds number flow in complicated geometries (where grid resolution should depend both on time and location).

For β » 1, the jet is highly confined and there is virtually no dilution within the riser. For β ≤ 1. 5, the confinement has no effect.

Reliable operation, high combustion efficiency and limited temperature increase along the combustion <b>riser</b> <b>tube</b> have been attained at different operating conditions. However, CO emission has been rather higher than expected. A form of micro-explosive behaviour of the fuel has been experienced at relatively low bed temperatures (710 ¿ 730 ¿C), but this behaviour was significantly less intense than in bubbling fluidized beds. A mathematical model of the combustion of liquid fuels has been adapted to ICFB conditions. The comparison between model and experimental results demonstrates that the efficiency of fuel-air mixing has a crucial role on combustion behaviour. Poor contact between air and fuel in {{the bottom half of}} the riser is responsible for high CO levels measured during the experiments.

40|$|Boiler swing rate, {{which is}} {{the rate at which}} the boiler load is changed, has {{significant}} influence on the parameters of the boiler operating conditions such as drum water pressure and level, steam quality in the riser tubes, wall temperatures of riser tubes, and the associated thermal stresses. In this paper, the thermal stresses developed in boiler tubes due to elevated rates of heat transfer and friction are presented versus thermal stresses developed in tubes operated under normal conditions. The differential equations comprising the nonlinear model and governing the flow inside the boiler tubes were formulated to study different operational scenarios in terms of resulting dynamic response of critical variables. The experimental results and field data were obtained to validate the present nonlinear dynamic model. The calculations of the heat flux and the allowable steam quality were used to determine the maximum boiler swing rates at different conditions of <b>riser</b> <b>tube</b> of friction factor and heat flux. Diagrams for the influence of friction factor of the boiler tubes and the heat flux, that the tube is subjected to, on the maximum swing rate were examined...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStress-controlled {{fatigue tests}} were run at {{different}} R ratios (¼ r min =r max) up to at most 3 million cycles on a 2. 5 %Cr– 1 %Mo steel (ASTM A 182 F 22) used in <b>riser</b> <b>tubes</b> connectors for offshore oil drilling. The fatigue lives, {{as well as}} the slope of the S–N curves were found to decrease with increasing R and the endurance limit to follow Gerber's parabola. Surface crack initiation without any defect involved, was most often observed for R = À 1, À 0. 5 and 0, while an R ratio of 0. 25 triggered crack initiation from either surface or internal pores or chemically inhomogeneous areas, leading, in the latter case, to fish-eye patterns for relatively low numbers of cycles. A further increase in R ratio to 0. 5 promoted only defect-initiated surface cracks, while no fatigue fracture was observed within 10 million cycles above R ¼ 0 : 6. These transitions in crack initiation mode are discussed based on X-ray diffraction analyses of residual stresses, elastic–plastic F. E. computations on a unit cell model containing a pore and some fracture mechanics analyses, with a particular attention to environmental effects...|$|R
40|$|Keywords: One of {{the most}} {{practically}} important problems in aerodynamics is calculating moderate to high Reynolds number flow around solid obstacles of arbitrary shape. This problem arises in aerodynamics (e. g. turbulent flow over the wings and fuselage of airplanes), in off-shore drilling (e. g. water flow around <b>riser</b> <b>tubes</b> transporting oil from the sea bed to the surface), and in the wind engineering of buildings. In each case the primary difficulty arises from the need to calculate turbulent or transitional flow with boundary conditions on complicated domains. In addition, it may be important {{to allow for the}} obstacle to move or deform in response to the applied fluid forces (this motion in turn affects the flow). In this paper we propose combining two mathematical approaches to calculate fluid–structure interaction numerically. The first technique, the adaptive wavelet method, tackles the problem of efficiently resolving a high Reynolds number flow in complicated geometries (where grid resolution should depend both on time and location). The second technique, Brinkman penalization, addresses the problem of efficiently implementing solid boundaries of arbitrary complexity. Turbulence, fluid-structure interaction, wavelets, penalization 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Experimental {{investigation}} of {{solar water heater}} cum distillation system {{has been carried out}} with different modes of feed water. The modes of feed were fresh water from the main supply and hot-water from the Natural Convection – solar water heater under withdrawal and non-withdrawal conditions. The natural convection solar water heater acted as an auxiliary pre-heater for the water to be distilled in the solar – still. The experimental investigation data on the distillation system consists of the distillate output and temperatures in the still at various locations from the absorber plate up to the glass cover and it’s ambient. While, on the solar water heater, the data recorded were temperatures at the inlet and outlet of the water flowing inside the <b>riser</b> <b>tubes.</b> The experimental data were collected between 11 : 00 Hours and 14 : 00 Hours on different days after every 10 minutes. The global radiations were also recorded simultaneously. Temperature profile in the still and average temperatures of the water basin, base plate, glass –cover and the vapour have demonstrated graphically and discussed. The distillate output and efficiency of the solar still at outdoor conditions with fresh feed water and that from the solar water heater under withdrawal and non- withdrawal conditions have been investigated and their effects discussed...|$|R
