40|$|We {{report a}} case of heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} thrombosis (HITT) syndrome in a patient prophylactically treated with low molecular weight heparin. A 66 -year-old men underwent radiofrequency-assisted partial liver resection for colorectal carcinoma liver metastases a year-and-ahalf {{after he had been}} operated for rectal cancer. In the postoperative period, patient was prophilactically treated with <b>reviparin</b> <b>sodium.</b> On the 8 th postoperative day, the platelet count decreased by more than 50 % without clinical signs of thrombosis. HITT syndrome was suspected on the 19 th postoperative day, after iliacofemoropopliteal thrombosis had developed, and related diagnosis was supported by the strongly positive particle gel agglutination technique immunoassay. Heparin was withdrawn and alternative anticoagulant, danaparoid sodium, was introduced in therapeutic doses. Despite delayed recognition, favorable clinical outcome was achieved. HITT syndrome should be considered with priority among the possible causes of thrombocytopenia in a surgical patient on heparin...|$|E
40|$|Background Low-molecular-weight heparin {{is known}} to be safe and {{effective}} for the initial Treatment of patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis. However, its application to patients with pulmonary embolism or previous episodes of thromboembolism has not been studied. Methods We randomly assigned 1021 patients with symptomatic venous thromboembolism to fixed-dose, subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (<b>reviparin</b> <b>sodium)</b> or adjusted-dose, intravenous unfractionated heparin. Oral anticoagulant therapy with a coumarin derivative was started concomitantly and continued for 12 weeks, Approximately one third of the patients had associated pulmonary embolism, The outcome events studied over the 12 weeks were symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and death. We sought to determine whether low-molecular-weight heparin is at least equivalent to unfractionated heparin in patients with venous thromboembolism. Results Twenty-seven of the 510 patients assigned to low-molecular-weight heparin (5. 3 percent) had recurrent thromboembolic events, as compared with 25 of the 511 patients assigned to unfractionated heparin (4. 9 percent). The difference of 0. 4 percentage point indicates that the two therapies have equivalent value according to our predetermined definition of equivalence. Sixteen patients assigned to low-molecular-weight heparin (3. 1 percent) and 12 patients assigned to unfractionated heparin (2. 3 percent) had episodes of major bleeding (P= 0. 63), and the mortality rates in the two groups were 7. 1 percent and 7. 6 percent, respectively (P= 0. 89). Conclusions Fixed-dose, subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin is as effective and safe as adjusted-dose, intravenous unfractionated heparin for the initial management of venous thromboembolism, regardless of whether the patient has pulmonary embolism or a history of venous thromboembolism.

40|$|<b>Reviparin</b> <b>sodium</b> is a low–molecular weight heparin with an anti–factor Xa:anti–factor IIa {{ratio of}} ≥ 3. 6 and {{negligible}} effects on global clotting tests. It {{has been shown}} to be as effective as unfractioned heparin in different prophylactic indications, causing fewer injection-site hematomas as well [1]. Here we report the case of a patient with acquired hemophilia successfully treated with standard therapy plus reviparin. A 65 -year-old man with a history of renal adenocarcinoma was hospitalized with extensive subcutaneous hematomas; he was under treatment with antipsychotic drugs. Hemoglobin was 80 g/L, bilirubin 60. 2 µmol/L (indirect: 34. 7 µmol/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 14. 7 µkat/L. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 97 seconds, prothrombin time was normal, fibrinogen level was 6. 60 g/L and D-dimer 1751 ng/mL. The patient received fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells, and methylprednisolone (0. 5 mg/kg per day) without any benefit, then he was transferred to our department. Positive direct antiglobulin test results and low haptoglobin indicated the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The prolonged aPTT of a mixture of a 1 : 1 volume of patient’s plasma with normal plasma at 37 °C for 2 hours suggested the presence of coagulation inhibitors [2]. Specificity for factor VIII was shown by incubating serial dilutions of the patient’s plasma with an equal volume of normal plasma and performing assays of factor VIII, IX, and XI at 0, 60, and 120 minutes on each mixed dilution [3]. Only factor VIII decreased over time, and the inhibitor titer was 2. 6 Bethesda units. The discrepancy between severe bleeding and low titer of antibodies was not surprising; in fact, Bethesda assay underestimates the levels of acquired inhibitors, because of the complexity of reaction kinetics and variation in antibody affinities [4]. On day 3, the patient’s hemoglobin level was 47 g/L; computed tomography revealed a hemothorax and a sub capsular hepatic hematoma. The patient received fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells, human factor VIII (bolus of 150 IU/kg plus continuous infusion of 10 IU/kg per hour, to a maximum of 9000 IU), prednisone (1 mg/kg per day), and antifibrinolytic treatment with tranexamic acid (500 mg intravenously 3 times a day) [4, 5]. Antipsychotic drugs were withdrawn, because acquired inhibitors may be associated with these drugs. Thromboprophylaxis with subcutaneous reviparin (4200 IU/d) was started, because of the evidence of ongoing intravascular fibrin formation (D-dimer elevation), risk factors for thrombosis (eg, immobilization), and the hemostatic imbalance induced by antifibrinolytic treatment. Although thrombotic events are unusual in acquired hemophilia, there has been a case report concerning pulmonary embolism associated with tranexamic acid therapy [6]. On day 9 aPTT was 85 seconds; there were no signs of active bleeding, but persisting hemolysis was demonstrated by laboratory tests. The patient was started on high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin G (400 mg/kg per day x 5 days, followed by periodic maintenance doses), which resulted in a sudden shortening of aPTT and reduction of the inhibitor titer [7]. On day 63, aPTT was 43 seconds, hemoglobin 108 g/ L, and inhibitors were undetectable. Any recurrence of renal malignancy was ruled out. One month after discharge the aPTT was 30 seconds, fibrinogen 4. 46 g/L, D-dimer 342 ng/ mL, bilirubin 5. 0 µmol/L, LDH 4. 3 µkat/L, haptoglobin 1. 83 g/L, and hemoglobin 127 g/L, showing a complete recovery. In conclusion, antifibrinolytic therapy is of proven benefit in the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with acquired hemophilia [5]. Nevertheless, tranexamic acid contributes to an increased thromboembolic risk in this setting. In our patient, prophylaxis with reviparin was safe and effective in the prevention of thrombotic events, without any evidence of bleeding complications...|$|E
