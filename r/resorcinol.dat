5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, <b>resorcinol,</b> catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of biological membranes are often regulated by special molecules produced by organisms. Knowledge about the {{mechanisms by which}} these molecules affect biological membranes is a key issue in understanding living organisms. The interactions between phospholipid membranes and different molecules were studied using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and the Solvent Relaxation (SR) technique. As a first example how molecules can modulate membrane properties the effect of isoprene on the stability of phospholipid bilayer was investigated. Isoprene is produced by plants and emitted to the atmosphere in large amounts during a rapid temperature rise. MD simulations show that the order parameters of the system with isoprene {{are similar to the}} order parameter of the pure phospholipid bilayer at a temperature of 10 degrees lower. By this mechanism thermal damage of the membrane can by prevented. A second example of molecules that specifically interact with cell membranes are resorcinolic lipids. Experimental data show that these lipids can either stabilize or disturb the lamellar structure of membranes. Our results show that resorcinolic lipids stabilize the bilayer by increasing the packing of the alkyl tails of the lipids. Our focus was on three homologs that differ in the length of their alkyl tail. When incorporated into the bilayer from the aqueous solution, however, resorcinolic lipids disturb the lamellar organization of the bilayer. Two different pathways were identified either with or without formation of a water pore. Extreme deformation of the bilayer sometimes leads to transition into a non-lamellar structure. The dual effect of <b>resorcinols</b> was also investigated by the SR method. The hydration level of the bilayer in the region of the ester groups of the phospholipids was studied through a change of the total spectral shift and relaxation times of the fluorescent probe. However, if <b>resorcinols</b> were added to preformed vesicles, a higher level of hydration and faster relaxation times were observed which is indicative of increased disorder in the system. ...|$|R

In 1975, Dr. Marc Kurzman at the University of Minnesota, in collaboration with fourteen other scientists, published a study in The Journal of Criminal Defense that concluded: “The microscopic and chemical screening tests presently used in marijuana analysis are not specific even in combination for ‘marijuana’ defined in any way.” In the 35 years since that study was published, no one has ever refuted this finding.|$|R
