25|$|The rank flag or {{distinguishing}} flag is {{the flag}} flown by a superior officer on his flagship or headquarters (hence the term flagship). The origins {{of this are}} from the era before radiotelegraphy and <b>radiotelephony,</b> when orders were given by flag signals. The flag denotes the ship which must be watched for signals designating orders. Such flags are also flown when leaders of the government (presidents, prime ministers or defense secretaries) are aboard Navy ships, showing the ship to hold the headquarters of highest level of authority for the Armed Forces. Today, with the progress in communications, this flag indicates the obligation of the other Naval vessels to pay the relevant honours (Manning the rails, firing cannon salute, attention, etc.) according to nautical etiquette. In a group of naval ships all commanded by superior officers, only {{the commander of the}} group or the officer of the highest rank can fly his flag.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a series}} of tests {{conducted}} at the U.S. Army's Langley Field in Hampton, Virginia, in July and August 1917, the world's first [...] "plane-to-plane" [...] and [...] "ground-to-plane, and vice versa" [...] communications by <b>radiotelephony</b> (as opposed to radiotelegraphy which had been developed earlier) were made to and from modified US Army JN-4s by Western Electric Company (Bell Labs) design engineers Lewis M. Clement and Raymond Heising, the developers of the experimental wind generator-powered airborne wireless voice transmitter and receiver equipment.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947 Bell Labs was {{the first}} to propose a {{cellular}} radio telephone network. The primary innovation was the development of a network of small overlapping cell sites supported by a call switching infrastructure that tracks users as they move through a network and passes their calls from one site to another without dropping the connection. In 1956 the MTA system was launched in Sweden. The early efforts to develop mobile telephony faced two significant challenges: allowing a great number of callers to use the comparatively few available frequencies simultaneously and allowing users to seamlessly move from one area to another without having their calls dropped. [...] Both problems were solved by Bell Labs employee Amos Joel who, in 1970 applied for a patent for a mobile communications system. [...] However, a business consulting firm calculated the entire U.S. market for mobile telephones at 100,000 units and the entire worldwide market at no more than 200,000 units based on the ready availability of pay telephones and the high cost of constructing cell towers. [...] As a consequence, Bell Labs concluded that the invention was [...] "of little or no consequence," [...] leading it not to attempt to commercialize the invention. [...] The invention earned Joel induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008. [...] The first call on a handheld mobile phone was made on April 3, 1973 by Martin Cooper, then of Motorola to his opposite number in Bell Labs who were also racing to be first. [...] Bell Labs went on to install the first trial cellular network in Chicago in 1978. This trial system was licensed by the FCC to ATT for commercial use in 1982 and, as part of the divestiture arrangements for the breakup of ATT, the AMPS technology was distributed to local telcos. [...] The first commercial system opened in Chicago in October 1983. [...] A system designed by Motorola also operated in the Washington D.C./Baltimore area from summer 1982 and became a full public service later the following year. [...] Japan's first commercial <b>radiotelephony</b> service was launched by NTT in 1978.|$|E

50|$|Not all {{ship-to-shore}} {{radio communications}} were short range. Some radio stations provided long-range <b>radiotelephony</b> services, such as radio telegrams and radio telex calls, on the HF bands (3-30 MHz) enabling worldwide communications with ships. For example, Portishead Radio, {{which was the}} world's busiest <b>radiotelephony</b> station, provided HF long-range services. In 1974, it had 154 radio operators who handled over 20 million words per year. Such large <b>radiotelephony</b> stations employed {{large numbers of people}} and were expensive to operate. By the end of the 1980s, satellite services had started to take an increasingly large share of the market for ship-to-shore communications.|$|E
50|$|CPDLC: controller-pilot {{data link}} {{communications}} - allows digital messages {{to be sent}} between controllers and pilots, avoiding the need to use <b>radiotelephony.</b> It is especially useful in areas where difficult-to-use HF <b>radiotelephony</b> was previously used for communication with aircraft, e.g. oceans.

50|$|Marine <b>radiotelephony</b> {{first became}} {{common in the}} 1930s, and was used {{extensively}} for communications to ships and aircraft over water. In that time, most long-range aircraft had long-wire antennas that would be let out during a call, and reeled-in afterward. Marine <b>radiotelephony</b> originally used AM mode in the 2-3 MHz region before the transition to SSB and the adoption of various higher frequency bands {{in addition to the}} 2 MHz frequencies.|$|E
5000|$|The RAF <b>radiotelephony</b> {{spelling}} alphabet {{was used}} by the British Royal Air Force (RAF) to aid communication after the take-up of radio, especially to spell out aircraft identification letters, e.g. [...] "H-Harry", [...] "G for George" [...] etc. Several alphabets were used, before being superseded by the adoption of the NATO/ICAO <b>radiotelephony</b> alphabet. While sometimes referred to as the [...] "RAF Phonetic Alphabet", it is a spelling alphabet rather than a true phonetic alphabet.|$|E

50|$|ELPAC tests English {{language}} proficiency at ICAO level 4. (operational) and level 5 (extended) Both standard ICAO phraseology and plain language {{are included in}} the test.

There are currently two versions of ELPAC available, which were designed specifically to reflect the communicative functions of air traffic controllers and commercial pilots.|$|E
50|$|Communication is a {{vital part}} of the job: {{officers}} are trained to precisely focus on the exact words pilots and other controllers or FISOs use. As with controllers, FISOs communicate with the pilots of aircraft using a push-to-talk <b>radiotelephony</b> system, which has many attendant issues such as the fact only one transmission can be made on a frequency at a time, or transmissions will either merge or block each other and become unreadable.|$|E
