2500|$|It {{can be too}} {{difficult}} to withdraw from short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepines because of {{the intensity of the}} rebound symptoms felt between doses. Moreover, short-acting benzodiazepines appear to produce a more intense withdrawal syndrome. For this reason, discontinuation is sometimes carried out by first substituting an equivalent dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine with a longer-acting one like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide. Failure to use the correct equivalent amount can precipitate a severe withdrawal reaction. Benzodiazepines with a half-life of more than 24 hours include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, chlorazepinic acid, ketazolam, medazepam, nordazepam, and prazepam. [...] Benzodiazepines with a half-life of less than 24 hours include alprazolam, bromazepam, brotizolam, flunitrazepam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam. The resultant equivalent dose is then gradually reduced. The <b>reduction</b> <b>rate</b> used in the Heather Ashton protocol calls for eliminating 10% of the remaining dose every two to four weeks, depending on the severity and response to reductions with the final dose at 0.5mg dose of diazepam or 5mg dose of chlordiazepoxide.|$|E

To date, the influence of these environmental dynamics on microbial sulfate reduction has not been well constrained. Here, via multivariate experiments, we evaluate the effects of key environmental variables (temperature, pH, H 2 S, SO 42 -, DOC) on sulfate <b>reduction</b> <b>rates</b> and metabolic energy yields in material recovered from a hydrothermal flange from the Grotto edifice in the Main Endeavor Field, Juan de Fuca Ridge. Sulfate reduction was measured in batch reactions {{across a range of}} physico-chemical conditions.

To determine whether mRNA levels of key respiratory genes might be correlated with respiration rates in Geobacter sulfurreducens, studies were conducted with fumarate as the electron acceptor and acetate as the limiting electron donor in anaerobic continuous cultures. Levels of mRNA for a fumarate reductase gene, frdA, quantified by real-time reverse transcription-PCR were directly correlated with fumarate <b>reduction</b> <b>rates.</b> In similar studies with Fe(III) as the electron acceptor, mRNA levels for omcB, a gene for an outer membrane c-type cytochrome involved in Fe(III) reduction, were positively correlated with Fe(III) <b>reduction</b> <b>rates.</b> Levels of mRNA for frdA and omcB were also positively correlated with fumarate and Fe(III) <b>reduction</b> <b>rates,</b> respectively, when growth was limited by the availability of fumarate or Fe(III), but mRNA levels were higher than in acetate-limited cultures. Levels of mRNA for omcC, which encodes a c-type cytochrome highly similar to OmcB but not necessary for Fe(III) reduction, followed patterns different than those of omcB. This agrees with the previous finding that OmcC {{is not involved in}} Fe(III) reduction and suggests that changes in mRNA levels of omcB are related to its role in Fe(III) reduction.

In this study, the effect of low, environmentally relevant (mg L- 1) concentrations of vancomycin (VA), flumequine (FLU), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on nitrate <b>reduction</b> <b>rates</b> was studied in river sediments. Nitrate <b>reduction</b> <b>rates</b> were determined by supplying intact sediments for several weeks with both nitrate and antibiotics (ng L- 1, mu g L- 1, and mg L- 1 concentrations), including a non-amended control. Furthermore the concentrations of the three investigated antibiotics were measured in the initial (natural) sediments and the sediments supplied with the antibiotics. The antibiotic concentrations in the sediments decreased (on average 62 % for FLU and 93 % for SMX) during the experiments, indicating loss {{of antibiotics}} due to sorption or (bio) degradation. Nitrate <b>reduction</b> <b>rates</b> were not affected by environmental concentrations of VA, FLU and SMX. FLU and SMX only partially inhibited nitrate <b>reduction</b> <b>rates</b> at high, therapeutic concentrations by 41 and 39 % respectively. The three tested antibiotics significantly enhanced the production of nitrite, an intermediate in dissimilatory nitrate reduction. Nitrite production increased 1. 9 and 1. 4 fold for environmental VA concentrations (107 and 187 mu g L- 1 respectively), application of 58 mg L- 1 SMX resulted in a 7. 5 fold increase and augmented 16 and 8. 5 fold {{in the presence of}} respectively 13 mu g L- 1 and 52 mg L- 1 FLU. Even though inhibition of nitrate <b>reduction</b> <b>rates</b> was observed at therapeutic antibiotic concentrations, nitrate reduction proceeded under all experimental conditions, indicating the presence of resistance toward these antibiotics among the nitrate reducing bacteria.
