The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which <b>reasonable</b> <b>people</b> might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E
25|$|Thomas Campbell {{combined}} the Enlightenment approach to unity with the Reformed and Puritan traditions of restoration. The Enlightenment affected the Campbell movement in two ways.

25|$|Even the {{youngest}} children quickly learn that, {{with varying degrees}} of probability, consequences flow from physical acts and omissions. The more predictable the outcome, the greater the likelihood that the actor caused the injury or loss intentionally. There are many ways in which the law might capture this simple rule of practical experience: that there is a natural flow to events, that a reasonable man in the same situation would have foreseen this consequence as likely to occur, that the loss flowed naturally from the breach of contractual duties or tortuous actions, etc. However it is phrased, the essence of the degree of fault attributed will lie in the fact that <b>reasonable</b> <b>people</b> try to avoid injuring others, so if harm was foreseeable, there should be liability {{to the extent that the}} extent of the harm actually resulting was foreseeable.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the court {{acknowledged}} that using a 15-gram differentia {{might not be}} the best method of furthering the social object of the MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better differentia was one which <b>reasonable</b> <b>people</b> may not necessarily agree on, and so this was a question of social policy best left to the legislature, not the judiciary. Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited deterrent effect on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within the its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue was a question of policy and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged {{it could be argued that}} there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's deterrent effect on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a deterrent effect.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Neon Bible {{garnered}} universal acclaim, {{receiving an}} 87—the seventh highest score of 2007—from review aggregator Metacritic. NME reviewer Mark Beaumont commented the album [...] "is a climactic monolith {{of a record}} in the grand tradition of melodic transatlantic clamour rock." [...] The A.V.

500|$|The {{requirement}} that the action be dangerous was confirmed in R v Newbury, which applied the previous reasoning on R v Church: [...] "the unlawful act must be such that all sober and <b>reasonable</b> <b>people</b> would inevitably recognise it as an act which must subject the other person to at least the risk of some harm resulting therefrom albeit not serious harm". This is an (almost completely) objective test, it disregards whether the defendant in particular foresaw the danger, and requires only that it would create a risk of some harm. The ordinary person knows only what the defendant did, at least {{in relation to the}} susceptibility of the victim. R v Ball did, however, create a class of dangerous [...] that of the act itself [...] where the jury knew more than the defendant; in this case, whilst the defendant knew he was loading a blank cartridge, the jury was entitled to ascribe knowledge that it might be a live cartridge to the reasonable man. This has been criticised, and may not have been necessary. The act need not be directed at the victim: the killing of an innocent bystander by mistake could be manslaughter.|$|E

[...] He also said it appeared that there had been progress made regarding the naturalistic origins of DNA.

In the same interview, Flew was asked whether he was retracting belief in an Aristotelian God, but answered no.|$|R
500|$|Occasionally, the {{distinction}} between errors of law and errors of fact can be fuzzy.

This can be the case where a statutory term evaluated by the authority is so general and ambiguous that <b>reasonable</b> <b>people</b> may peg different meanings to it. In such a situation, it is generally left to the authority to evaluate the meaning of the term. This is illustrated by Puhlhofer v. Hillingdon London Borough Council (1986), which involved a public authority that bore a statutory responsibility for providing homeless people with accommodation. The applicants were a married couple who lived with their two children in a single room in a guest house. Their application for permanent accommodation was rejected because the authority claimed they were not [...] "homeless" [...] within the meaning of the statute.

2500|$|In {{the colonial}} era of the United States, some {{settlers}} adapted community health nursing practices. Individuals with mental defects that were deemed as dangerous were incarcerated or kept in cages, maintained and paid fully by community attendants. Wealthier colonists kept their insane relatives either in their attics or cellars and hired attendants, or nurses, to care for them. In other communities, the mentally ill were sold at auctions as slave labor. Others were forced to leave town. [...] As {{the population in the}} colonies expanded, informal care for the community failed and small institutions were established. In 1752 the first “lunatics ward” was opened at the Pennsylvania Hospital which attempted to treat the mentally ill. Attendants used the most modern treatments of the time: purging, bleeding, blistering, and shock techniques. Overall, the attendants caring for the patients believed in treating the institutionalized with respect. They believed if the patients were treated as <b>reasonable</b> <b>people,</b> then they would act as such; if they gave them confidence, then patients would rarely abuse it.|$|E

2500|$|Philosopher Peter Singer of Princeton University {{has argued}} that ALF direct action can only be {{regarded}} as a just cause if it is non-violent, and that the ALF is at its most effective when uncovering evidence of animal abuse that other tactics could not expose. He cites 1984's [...] "Unnecessary Fuss" [...] campaign, when ALF raided the University of Pennsylvania's head-injury research clinic and removed footage showing researchers laughing at the brain damage of conscious baboons, as an example. The university responded that the treatment of the animals conformed to National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines, but {{as a result of the}} publicity, the lab was closed down, the chief veterinarian fired, and the university placed on probation. Barbara Orlans, a former animal researcher with the NIH, now with the Kennedy Institute of Ethics, writes that the case stunned the biomedical community, and is today considered one of the most significant cases in the ethics of using animals in research. Singer argues that if the ALF would focus on this kind of direct action, instead of sabotage, it would appeal to the minds of <b>reasonable</b> <b>people.</b> Against this, Steven Best writes that industries and governments have too much institutional and financial bias for reason to prevail.|$|E
2500|$|The {{years of}} 1953-54 {{provided}} a contrasting picture: the Carlist leaders boasted {{of having a}} new king, while Don Javier withdrew to Lignières, reducing his political activity to receiving guests and to correspondence.

Carlist dissenters, temporarily silenced, started to be heard again. Don Javier seemed increasingly tired of his role and leaning towards a dynastical understanding with Don Juan. His brief early 1955 visit to Spain en route to Portugal fuelled angry rumors of forthcoming rapprochement with the Alfonsists as Don Javier made some ambiguous comments, named the 1952 statement [...] "a grave error" [...] and declared having been bullied into it. At this point relations between him and Fal reached the lowest point; Fal, attacked from all sides and feeling no royal support, resigned. According to some scholars, Don Javier sacked him in [...] "a rather cowardly, backhand manner". Fal was soon replaced by a collegial executive. In late 1955 Don Javier issued a manifesto which declared the Carlists [...] "custodians of patrimony" [...] rather than political party seeking power and in private considered his royal claim a hindrance to alliance of all <b>reasonable</b> <b>people.</b> The year of 1956 proved convulsing, {{with a number of}} contradictory declarations following one another in circles; one episode cost Don Javier another expulsion from Spain.|$|E

Background People with learning disabilities experience significant inequalities in accessing healthcare. Legal frameworks, such as the Equality Act 2010, are intended to reduce such disparities in care, and require organisations to make ???<b>reasonable</b> adjustments??? for <b>people</b> with disabilities, including learning disabilities. However, reasonable adjustments are often not clearly defined or adequately implemented in clinical practice. Aim To examine and synthesise the challenges in caring for people with learning disabilities to develop a {{framework for}} making <b>reasonable</b> adjustments for <b>people</b> with learning disabilities in hospital. This framework would assist ward staff in identifying and managing the challenges of delivering person-centred, safe and effective healthcare to people with learning disabilities in this setting. Method Fourth-generation evaluation, collaborative thematic analysis, reflection and a secondary analysis were used to develop a framework for making reasonable adjustments in the hospital setting. The authors attended ward manager and matron group meetings to collect their claims, concerns and issues, then conducted a collaborative thematic analysis with the group members to identify the main themes. Findings Four main themes were identified from the ward manager and matron group meetings: communication, choice-making, collaboration and coordination. These were used to develop the 4 C framework for making <b>reasonable</b> adjustments for <b>people</b> with learning disabilities in hospital. Discussion The 4 C framework has provided a basis for delivering person-centred care for people with learning disabilities. It {{has been used to}} inform training needs analyses, develop audit tools to review delivery of care that is adjusted appropriately to the individual patient; and to develop competencies for learning disability champions. The most significant benefit of the 4 C framework has been in helping to evaluate and resolve practice-based scenarios. Conclusion Use of the 4 C framework may enhance the care of people with learning disabilities in hospital, by enabling reasonable adjustments to be made in these settings...|$|R
