30|$|Vessel {{recognition}} aims at {{revealing the}} accurate {{identity of a}} vessel by analyzing an unseen example image of it and finding out the matching vessel within a group of vessels. This task may be particularly useful for scenarios of marine surveillance and <b>port</b> <b>registration.</b> For this task, first, we performed recognition for vessels considering their type labels, for instance, identifying a passenger ship among other passenger ships. Next, we attempt a more challenging recognition problem, identifying vessels where no additional cues such as vessel type labels or category labels are given.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{extension}} of the lazy functional programming language Haskell for distributed programming. For the communication between processes we add a port concept. Ports behave like channels in Concurrent Haskell except that only the process which creates a port can read from it. Ports can also be sent through other ports. The receiver can then also write messages through the received port. This is independent of the location in a network. The programmer uses the same functions to write to local or remote ports. Communication between concurrent and distributed processes is programmed with the same functions. Concurrent processes can easily be distributed, for example to provide scalability of a system. In many distributed applications it is necessary that two independently started programs can connect at runtime. Therefore we provide the <b>registration</b> of <b>ports.</b> Other processes can look them up from anywhere in a network. The implementation consists of a library which [...] ...|$|R

30|$|The draught of {{a vessel}} {{is a measure}} {{describing}} the vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of vessel hull. Draught, defining the minimum depth of water a vessel can operate, {{is an important factor}} for navigating and routing vessels while avoiding shallow water pathways. Length of a vessel does matter for navigation and marine traffic routing, as well as for calculating fees during vessel registration. Consequently, estimating length of a vessel effectively from a single image may be very beneficial for maritimeapplications. Gross tonnage is a nonlinear measure calculated based on overall interior volume (from keel to funnel) of a vessel. It is important in determining the number of staff, safety rules, <b>registration</b> fees, and <b>port</b> dues. Summer deadweight defines how much mass a ship can safely carry. It excludes the weight of the ship and includes the sum of the weights of cargo, fuel, fresh water, ballast water, provisions, passengers, and crew [36].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Image {{registration}} {{is a well-known}} concept within the medical image domain and {{has been shown to}} be useful in a number of different tasks. However, due to sometimes long processing times, image {{registration is}} not fully utilized in clinical workflows, where time is an important factor. During the last couple of years, a number of significant projects have been introduced to make the computational power of GPUs available to a wider audience, where the most well known is CUDA. In this paper we present, with the aid of CUDA, a speedup in the range of 38 - 44 x (from 29 minutes to 40 seconds) when implementing a phasebased non-rigid image registration algorithm, known as the Morphon, on a single GPU. The achieved speedup is in the same magnitude as the speedups reported from other non-rigid <b>registration</b> algorithms fully <b>ported</b> to the GPU. Given the impressive speedups, both reported in this paper and other papers, we therefore consider that it is now feasible to effectively integrate image registration into various clinical workflows, where time is a critical factor. ...|$|R

3000|$|... n-type GaSb {{whiskers}} doped with Te {{were selected}} for the study. The whiskers were grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method in a closed system [15]. The whisker’s diameter ranges from 15 to 20  μm with length from 4 to 5  mm. Current electrical contacts were created by welding Pt whiskers on the {{opposite ends of the}} studied whiskers. The distance between potentiometric contacts was equidistant and equal to 1  mm. The method provides resistive contact to the samples in the temperature range 4.2 – 300  K. As a result, linear I-V curves were obtained. Te is commonly used as n-type dopant in GaSb for creating the photovoltaic devices. The results of doped whiskers investigation by ion mass spectroscopy have shown that n-GaSb whiskers (ρ 300 K[*]=[*] 0.004  Ω cm) have Te concentration corresponding to the metallic side of metal-insulator transition and it is equal to 1.7 [*]×[*] 1018  cm− 3. To obtain reproducible results, a group of approximately ten whiskers with identical characteristics was studied. The samples have been cooled down to 1.5  K in helium cryostat. A special inset with a bifilar winding heater has been used to heat-up samples to room temperature. Stabilized electrical current of 1 – 100  μA depending on the resistance of the sample has been generated by Keithley 224 current source. Digital multimeters Keithley 2000 and Keithley 2010, with simultaneous automatic data <b>registration</b> via parallel <b>port</b> of PC, have been used to measure both the voltage at potential contacts of the samples, output signals from thermocouple and magnetic field sensor with accuracy up to 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  V. The Bitter magnet-based setup has been used to study the effect of strong magnetic field on the samples. The induction of the magnet increases from B[*]=[*] 0 up to B[*]=[*] 14  T at a rate ~ 1.75 and 3.5  T/min at 4.2  K and higher temperature range, respectively.|$|R
