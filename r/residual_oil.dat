40|$|Abstract: This study {{described}} {{the extraction of}} <b>residual</b> <b>oils</b> of spent bleaching earth (SBE) from palm oil refining industry, the properties and applications of <b>residual</b> <b>oils</b> obtained there from. <b>Residual</b> <b>oils</b> of SBE (acid-activated, WAC and neutral, NC) were recovered via solvent and supercritical-fluid (SC-CO 2) extraction. The yields of <b>residual</b> <b>oils</b> recovered from WAC were higher than those from NC using solvent and SC-CO 2 extraction respectively. Both the <b>residual</b> <b>oils</b> recovered from WAC and NC had fatty acids composition (FAC) {{similar to that of}} crude palm oil. These oils exhibited poor qualities in terms of free fatty acids (FFA) content and peroxide value (PV). As the <b>residual</b> <b>oils</b> had very high FFA value (more than 10 %), they were no longer suitable for food applications. Alternatively, these oils can be converted to their respective methyl esters for biofuel and other non-food applications as they were thermally and chemically stable with induction period of up to 29 h in Rancimat test. The methyl esters conversion via esterification and transesterification gave optimum yields of more than 80 %. The methyl esters obtained have comparable fuel properties as petroleum diesel; hence, they can be used as diesel substitute...|$|R

2500|$|Oil is {{generally}} {{a product of}} thermal breakdown of type I and type II kerogen during catagenesis. The deuterium content should reflect the source kerogen signal, generation fractionation, isotopic exchange and other maturation effects. The thermal maturation at the oil window can erase much of the primary signals of hydrogen isotopes. The formation of oil involves breaking C-C and C-H bonds, resulting in depletion of 13C and D in the products and enrichment in the residual reactants due to kinetic isotope effects. Yongchun Tang and his colleagues modeled this process based on laboratory-calibrated kinetics data {{and found that the}} frequency factor ratio for D/H is 1.07. Moreover, oil is also affected by the isotope fractionation from phase-change. However, the behavior of oil gas-liquid fractionation differs from water as the vapor phase of oil is enriched in D. This will deplete <b>residual</b> <b>oil</b> as it gets evaporated. Biological degradation of oil is also expected to fractionate hydrogen isotopes, as enzymatic breaking of C-H bond have a normal kinetic isotope effect. Several degradation experiments show that this fractionation {{is generally}} mild, ranging from -11‰ to -79‰. This process should also enrich partially degraded oil. Finally, oil stored in a reservoir often had migrated through subsurface (also known as [...] "geochromatography") from another source region, interacting with water. No data has been published to confirm the fractionation associated with migration, yet theoretical prediction shows that this is likely to be very small.|$|E

Unravelling the contribution and character of each charge is amongst the most daring challenges in petroleum geochemistry. This paper describes an approach that involves the evaluation of both free and <b>residual</b> <b>oils</b> to reconstruct the history of petroleum accumulation within the multi-reservoir Gidgealpa Field, located in the Cooper and Eromanga Basins of central Australia. Porewall-coating <b>residual</b> <b>oils</b> form by reservoir wetting processes and grow continuously by adsorption of polar compounds, retaining molecular information on the first oil that was present in the pore system. Such sequentially recovered <b>residual</b> <b>oils</b> proved useful in reconstructing the record of oil charges to the Gidgealpa Ridge. Using Araucariacaean markers for source discrimination and the benzocarbazole a/(a + c) ratio (BCR) for identification of the source region, five discrete charging events were distinguished. In contrast to most previous studies, benzocarbazole distributions {{were found to be}} independent of lithofacies, organic facies and maturity. However, alkylated carbazoles did exhibit a pronounced facies dependency. The application of alkylcarbazoles as source markers in the study area provides the first evidence of the expulsion of petroleum from Cambrian marine source rocks in the underlying Warburton Basin.
