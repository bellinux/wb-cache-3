5|$|Many {{examples}} of <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> by the Muisca {{have been discovered}} on the Altiplano. The first <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> has been discovered by conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada during the Spanish conquest of the Muisca. The <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> consists of petroglyphs (carvings) and petrographs (drawings). The petrographs were made using the index finger. Pioneer {{in the study of}} the <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> has been Miguel Triana. Later contributions have been done by Diego Martínez, Eliécer Silva Celis and others. It is theorised that the <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> has been made under the influence of ayahuasca (yahé).|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, 3487 {{locations}} of <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> {{had been discovered}} in Cundinamarca alone, of which 301 on the Bogotá savanna. Other locations have been found over the years. The <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> of the Archaeological Park of Facatativá is heavily vandalised. Plans {{for the preservation of}} the unique cultural heritage have been formulated since the mid 2000s. The petrographs of Soacha are endangered by the mining activities in the fastly growing suburb of Bogotá, as is happening with other mining districts; Chía, Sibaté, Tunja, Sáchica and others.|$|E

5|$|Neolithic petroglyphs from Asia depict antler-less female elk, {{which have}} been {{interpreted}} as symbolizing rebirth and sustenance.

5|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>art</b> {{is found}} {{throughout}} the Mesa Verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. Some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. Styles also vary over time. Examples are relatively rare on Mesa Verde proper, but abundant in the middle San Juan River area, which might indicate the river's importance as a travel route and key source of water. Common motifs in the <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> of the region include, anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth, handprints, animal and people tracks, wavy lines, spirals, concentric circles, animals, and hunting scenes. As the region's population plummeted during the late 13th century, the subject of Mesa Verdean <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> increasingly shifted to depictions of shields, warriors, and battle scenes. Modern Hopi have interpreted the petroglyphs at Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point as depictions of various clans of people.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} {{scarcity of}} hyena depictions in Paleolithic <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> has been theorised {{to be due}} to the animal's lower rank in the animal worship hierarchy; the spotted hyena's appearance was likely unappealing to Ice Age hunters, and it was not sought after as prey. Also, it was not a serious rival like the cave lion or cave bear, and it lacked the impressiveness of the mammoth or woolly rhino.|$|E
5|$|The same scholar has {{performed}} {{detailed analysis of}} the <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> in Facatativá; the Piedras del Tunjo Archaeological Park. The many petrographs in this location are painted using red, yellow, ochre, blue, black and white colours. The motives show a possible tobacco plant, commonly used by the Muisca, zig-zag patterns, anthropomorphic figures, concentric lines similar to those in Soacha and Sáchica, zoomorphic motives and anthropo-zoomorphic composites in the shape of frogs.|$|E
5|$|A {{script for}} text {{was not used}} by the Muisca, but the numerals were written with hieroglyphs. They have been {{analysed}} by various authors, such as Joaquín Acosta, Alexander von Humboldt and Liborio Zerda, and appear as <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> and on textiles. The frog {{is the most important}} and is represented in the numbers from one (ata) to twenty (gueta) five times, because the Muisca didn't have hieroglpyhs for the numbers 11 to 19, so used the numerals one to nine again in combination with ten; fifteen was thus ten-and-five; qhicħâ hɣcſcâ.|$|E

5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art {{may have had a}} ritual role in rites of initiation, vision quests or totemic ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures may have had a role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> of Soacha-Sibaté, in the {{southwest}} of the Bogotá savanna, has been studied in detail between 1970 and 2006, after initial studies by Triana. In these petrographs certain motives have been described; triangular heads are pictographs of human figures where the heads are painted in a triangular shape. They are applied using red colours and demonstrate various sizes. Similar motives are noted in Mongua, Tenjo and Tibacuy. In most cases of the <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> on the Altiplano, the body extremities, such as hands, are shown in simple shapes. In some cases however, the hands are elaborated with much more detail using spirals, concentric circles and more strokes, identified as complex hands. Apart from Sibaté, these shapes are encountered also in Saboyá and Tibaná in Boyacá. A third class of petrographs has been named radial representations. This motive shows the main figures with concentric square or circular lines drawn around them. The concentric circular drawings have been interpreted as representing the main deities of the Muisca religion; Chía (the Moon) and Sué, her husband the Sun. Rhomboidal motives are found in Sibaté, but their exact purpose {{has not yet been}} concluded. Both in Soacha and in Sibaté a fifth type of petrographs has been identified; winged figures. These motives resemble the birds that are described in tunjos and ceramics of the Altiplano.|$|E
5|$|This article {{describes}} the art produced by the Muisca. The Muisca established {{one of the four}} grand civilisations of the pre-Columbian Americas on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in present-day central Colombia. Their various forms of art have been described in detail and include pottery, textiles, body art, hieroglyphs and <b>rock</b> <b>art.</b> While their architecture was modest compared to the Inca, Aztec and Maya civilisations, the Muisca are best known for their skilled goldworking. The Museo del Oro in the Colombian capital Bogotá houses the biggest collection of golden objects in the world, from various Colombian cultures including the Muisca.|$|E

5|$|Twyfelfontein valley {{has been}} {{inhabited}} by Stone-age hunter-gatherers of the Wilton stone age culture group since approximately 6,000 years ago. They made {{most of the}} engravings and probably all the paintings. 2,000 to 2,500 years ago the Khoikhoi, an ethnic group related to the San (Bushmen), occupied the valley, then known under its Damara/Nama name ǀUi-ǁAis (jumping waterhole). The Khoikhoi also produced <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> which can clearly be distinguished from the older engravings.|$|E
5|$|From the Bronze Age {{there are}} {{extensive}} examples of <b>rock</b> <b>art.</b> These include cup and ring marks, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe {{and have been}} found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the Kilmartin district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in Kilmartin, and a boat pecked into Wemyss Cave, {{are believed to be}} the oldest known representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial cists in Lanarkshire and Kincardine.|$|E
5|$|Research in the 1960s by Eliécer Silva Celis on the <b>rock</b> <b>art</b> of Sáchica showed phytomorphic designs, masked human figures, {{singular}} and concentric rings, triangulated heads, {{and faces}} where {{the eyes and}} noses were drawn, but the mouths absent. The majority of the petrographs found here are abstract figures. The colours red, black and white dominate the rock paintings in Sáchica. The black has been analysed also at El Infiernito and is though {{to refer to a}} pre-Muisca origin. Radial structures drawn on the heads of the anthropomorphic petrographs are interpreted as feathers. Feathers were precious objects for the Muisca and used by the xeques and caciques during the El Dorado ritual in Lake Guatavita.|$|E
