40|$|The {{new view}} on the {{structure}} of the radiance signal <b>recorded</b> by optical <b>pyrometer</b> and the preliminary results of brightness detonation temperature of the emulsion explosive are presented. The structure of an optical signal observed is typical for the heterogeneous explosives. First, there is the short temperature spike to 2500 ÷ 3300 K connecting with a formation of “hot spots” assembly that fire the matrix capable of exothermal reaction. Then the relaxation of radiance to equilibrium level is observed that corresponds to brightness temperature 1840 ÷ 2260 K of explosion products at detonation pressure 1 ÷ 11 GPa. Experimental results are compared with the calculations of other authors. The detonation temperature of the investigated explosive is measured for the first time...|$|R
40|$|Mechanically-induced {{combustion}} {{reactions were}} carried out in a transparent quartz vial. The combustion processes were followed by high-speed video <b>recording</b> and optical <b>pyrometers.</b> Depending on the vial dynamics, the powder particles were seen to gather in a periodic collective motion, behaving like a granular gas characterised by subsequent changes in its density. After ignition, a considerable increase of brightness was observed, due to the extremely rapid propagation of the high-temperature reaction to the whole mass of powder. Experimental observations find a very good correlation if compared {{to the results of}} numerical calculations simulating the particle system dynamics. Balls and powder dynamics were reproduced according to a well-known visco-elastic force scheme, while chemical conversion of each powder particle was described by a conventional nucleation-and-growth kinetics. The propagation mechanism of the reaction was studied and related to the dynamic features of the whole system...|$|R
40|$|The solid-liquid {{transition}} in stoichiometric and hyperstoichiometric UO 2 was investigated {{by means of}} advanced techniques. Laser heating enabling fast melting and freezing processes was used under container-less conditions and buffer gas pressures up to 250 MPa, making non-congruent evaporation ineffective. Pulse thermograms of UO 2 +x with 0 <= x <= 0. 21 were <b>recorded</b> with fast <b>pyrometers</b> and interpreted with computer simulations. In addition, a novel method for identification of phase transitions was implemented, based on the detection of surface reflectivity variations. The melting line of UO 2. 00 was {{for the first time}} determined at pressures between 10 and 250 MPa, and the melting temperature of the stoichiometric oxide was measured to be 3147 20 K, in fair agreement to previous measurements reported in the literature. The liquidus and solidus lines of UO 2 +x, differ from the currently recommended data, which substantially underrate the effect of oxygen on melting. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Intense {{heavy ion}} beams are an {{excellent}} tool to create large-volume samples of high energy density (HED) matter with fairly uniform physical conditions. Experimental study of matter under extreme conditions of density, temperature and pressure is of considerable interest to fundamental research {{in the fields of}} plasma physics, atomic physics, astrophysics, geophysics {{as well as for the}} inertial fusion research and its applications. Recently, a series of HED physics experiments with heavy ion beams have been carried out at the GSI-Darmstadt. In these experiments, metallic targets of macroscopic volumes were heated by intense heavy ion beams uniformly and quasi-isochorically, thereby generating high-density, high-entropy states. The heated target material was expanding isentropically, passing through many interesting physical states located in the region of boiling curve, two-phase liquid-gas and the critical point. Most of the heavy ion beam energy is deposited within 120 ns which gives a possibility of appearance of intermediate meta-stable superheated liquid states. The fundamental thermodynamical properties of the target were measured during the heating as well as the expansion phases. The main subject of this work is the dynamic temperature measurement of the target material in the HED physics experiments with intense heavy ion beams. In the course of this work a fast multi-channel radiation pyrometer has been developed and successfully employed in experimental campaigns. The pyrometer allows measurement of brightness temperatures at 12 wavelengths with a nanosecond temporal resolution and the micrometer spatial resolution. The brightness temperatures are obtained from analysis of the Planck radiation in visible and near-infrared spectral regions. The absolute radiation emission <b>recorded</b> by the <b>pyrometer</b> at different wavelengths allow also determination of the physical temperature using different models of spectral emissivity. In the performed HED physics experiments with heavy ion beams target temperatures varying from 1000 K to 12000 K were measured for the first time. Different materials showed different behavior of hydrodynamic expansion, clearly seen on the <b>pyrometer</b> <b>records.</b> In addition to temperature measurements, measurements of target expansion dynamics have been carried out using a backlighting/shadowgraphy system based on a streak camera. Expansion velocities up to 2600 m/s have been registered for lead and up to 1700 m/s for tungsten targets. This work presents the first experimental results on temperature measurement in HED physics experiments with intense heavy ion beams. The developed fast multichannel pyrometer is indispensable for the present and the future HED physics experiments at GSI. The new experimental data, developed diagnostics and experience obtained during the course of this work are also of a great importance for planning future HED physics experiments at FAIR...|$|R
40|$|The broad {{objective}} of research {{described in this}} thesis was the experimental determination of the solid / liquid transition in both stoichiometric and hyperstoichiometric uranium dioxide. Experimental information in this field constitutes a necessary reference {{for the analysis of}} hypothetical nuclear reactor accidents and, in particular, for the formulation of an equation of state (EOS) for uranium dioxide. A review of previous research on the same topic revealed that only few and uncertain experimental data were available prior to this work, obtained with conventional thermal analysis techniques in which it was not possible, at temperatures close to melting, to prevent sample contamination from the containing material and non- congruent evaporation. The experimental approach in the current research consisted mainly of the development of a laser heating method that enabled fast (tens of ms) melting / freezing experiments under containerless conditions, during which the sample could be kept under a buffer gas at high pressure (tens of MPa) in order to suppress any evaporation. In this way, the main difficulties encountered by previous researchers were overcome. U 02 x samples with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0. 21 were prepared starting from original nuclear-grade pellets and analysed. Thermograms were <b>recorded</b> with fast <b>pyrometers</b> and interpreted {{with the help of a}} one-dimensional codesimulation of the measurements. In addition, a novel method for measurement of phase transition points was developed, based on the precise detection of surface reflectivity variations. The point of congruent melting was determined for the stoichiometric oxide in the pressure range between 0. 1 and 250 MPa. Liquidus and solidus lines were established, for pressures between 50 and 250 MPa, in the hyperstoichiometric range investigated. The results obtained, which in a number of cases significantly differed from the existing data, were finally used for a better assessment of the phase diagram of the system U 02 x in the vicinity of the melting transition...|$|R
