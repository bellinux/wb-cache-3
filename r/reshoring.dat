50|$|There {{have been}} some cases of <b>reshoring</b> that weren't successful. Otis Elevators’ <b>reshoring</b> effort did not go well. Otis says it failed to {{consider}} {{the consequences of the}} new location and tried to do too much at once, including a supply-chain software implementation. This is not an uncommon <b>reshoring</b> scenario. Bringing manufacturing back to the United States isn’t so simple, {{and there are a lot}} of considerations and analyses that companies must do to determine the costs and feasibility of <b>reshoring.</b> Some companies pursue <b>reshoring</b> with their own internal staff. But <b>reshoring</b> projects are complicated and involve engineering, marketing, production, finance, and procurement. In addition, there are real estate concerns, government incentives and training requirements that require outreach to the community. To help with these projects, companies often turn to consultants that specialize in <b>Reshoring.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Reshoring</b> (also {{known as}} onshoring, inshoring and backshoring) is {{the act of}} reintroducing {{domestic}} manufacturing to a country. It is the reverse process of offshoring, where manufacturing is moved to another country where labor is cheaper.|$|E

40|$|Offshoring is a {{strategy}} that has been employed by countless firms across the many industries over the last ten years. More recently, organisations have begun to understand and realise {{the full impact of}} this approach, particularly in the financial services sector. Whilst some firms recognise the benefits of offshoring there has been a greater understanding and emphasise put on the associated downsides of offshoring under the guise of risks and hidden costs. This has resulted in a changing viewpoint in relation to offshoring with some going as far as to initiate plans to <b>reshore</b> functions. This study employed a qualitative method through case study research, which was conducted through semi structured interviews of six senior managers within one international firm in Dublin. The results from the study show that offshoring has been a primary cost reduction strategy, widely applied. Benefits have arisen through error reduction and process improvement {{as a result of this}} strategy. However, there has been a shift in thinking in relation to the real cost savings or lack there of such savings. Generally due to the increased oversight arising because of knowledge loss and modulisation of process. This has led to a view that firms will begin to <b>reshore</b> functions to reset their financial plans. These results provide up to date findings in this area of research presenting interesting avenues for future research such as, the impact of technology on offshoring arrangements and also the impact of the upcoming economic changes in Europe in addition to the ever increasing regulatory change...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{systematic}} {{analyses for}} the shoring systems installed {{to support the}} applied loads during construction are performed {{on the basis of}} the numerical approach. On the basis of a rigorous time-dependent analysis, structural behaviors of reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures according to the changes in design variables such as the types of shoring systems, shore stiffness and shore spacing are analyzed and discussed. The time-dependent deformations of concrete such as creep and shrinkage and construction sequences of frame structures are also taken into account to minimize the structural instability and to reach to an improved design of shoring system because these effects may increase the axial forces delivered to the shores. In advance, the influence of the column shortening effect, generally mentioned in a tall building structure, is analyzed. From many parametric studies, it has been finally concluded that the most effective shoring system in RC frame structures is 2 S 1 R (two shores and one <b>reshore)</b> regardless of the changes in design variables...|$|R

The interaction of structure and compressible shoring, time-dependent concrete properties of strength, creep and shrinkage of concrete and the change in construction load during construction cycles are considered in the shoring system analysis. For wall formwork analysis, the time-dependent concrete properties of strength and the properties of wall-element parts are considered. The analytical results obtained by both the shoring system and the wall formwork analyses are checked against the field measurements and several existing methods. Various parameters that affect the construction load distribution among shores and <b>reshores</b> and interconnected slabs. and the fresh concrete pressure distribution on wall formwork are investigated.

5000|$|Criticism of outsourcing, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of U.S. citizens, generally revolves around the costs associated with transferring control of the labor process to an external entity in another country. A Zogby International poll conducted in August 2004 found that 71% of American voters believed that [...] "outsourcing jobs overseas" [...] hurt the economy while another 62% believed that the U.S. government should impose some legislative action against companies that transfer domestic jobs overseas, possibly in the form of increased taxes on companies that outsource. One prediction (from 2010) claims that, by 2014, more than 1.3 million positions will disappear because of [...] "the accelerated movement of work to India ..." [...] and some other countries willing to accept outsourced jobs. President Obama promoted an act titled 'Bring Jobs Home Act' that would help <b>reshore</b> jobs by giving incentives such as a tax cut or a 20 percent tax credit for moving operations back to the USA. The same bill was reintroduced in the 113th United States Congress as the Bring Jobs Home Act (S. 2569; 113th Congress).|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{offshoring}} and outsourcing {{have transformed}} fundamentally nationally based auto sectors into global networks of design, {{production and distribution}} across the global value chains coordinated by the major automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). As manufacturing activities tended to be shifted to low-labour cost locations in Asia, Africa and Latin America, high-end design, R&D, product development have stayed anchored mostly to high-cost and high knowledge-intensive home economy locations (perhaps with the except of some design and styling activities which are often located in major end markets around the world. However, very recently the weaknesses of and risks inherent in such global value chains (GVCs) have been exposed, triggering attempts to rethink their nature and also raising possibilities to <b>reshore</b> some manufacturing activities to home countries. A combination of a more competitive exchange rate (despite the very recent appreciation of sterling), increased transport costs, rising wages in key areas of China, and a greater awareness of supply chain resilience have all contributed to a perceived change in some business fundamentals. The potential for some supply chain relocalisation also links in with the servitisation of manufacturing including the auto sector and shift to a hybrid model where manufacturing and services are increasingly intertwined. However, there are limits as to how far this can go and these raise some important questions and issues over the possible role for industrial policy...|$|R

40|$|Interest in <b>reshoring,</b> {{defined as}} the return of {{manufacturing}} and service operations from previously offshored locations to the U. S., has gained momentum recently. Yet, there is no academic evidence on the shareholder value implications of <b>reshoring</b> decisions. This paper analyzes the shareholder wealth effects of 37 <b>reshoring</b> decisions announced by U. S. firms during 2006 – 2015. Our results indicate that <b>reshoring</b> announcements result in positive abnormal stock returns. Mean (median) abnormal stock returns on <b>reshoring</b> announcements are 0. 45 % (0. 29 %), corresponding with a mean (median) market value change of $ 322. 57 million ($ 31. 60 million). Our findings imply that the benefits associated with the <b>reshoring</b> tend to outweigh the costs. This finding is relevant for firms faced with the decision of whether to move business activities from offshore to domestic locations. It is also of interest to policy makers who may seek to further stimulate the <b>reshoring</b> phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} the analysis of <b>reshoring.</b> The framework is then applied to analyze motivations for <b>reshoring,</b> as they emerge from extant literature and from new evidence collected. Design We start by formulating a literature-grounded definition of <b>reshoring</b> and reviewing some key theoretical approaches for international manufacturing Locations. In light of these theories, we then propose an interpretative framework {{for the analysis of}} <b>reshoring</b> motivations. Finally, we provide new evidence on this phenomenon, by presenting the findings of an extensive data collection of <b>reshoring</b> cases built on secondary data. Findings We show that a vast array of single drivers of <b>reshoring</b> can be extracted from extant literature; however, our interpretative framework eventually highlights 4 main typologies of <b>reshoring</b> motivations, thus allowing for a more sound comprehension of why the phenomenon happens. Our empirical investigation also proves useful in comparing the relative importance of these motivations, as it reveals that value driven and country specific motivations prevail over efficiency driven and firm specific ones, respectively. Originality/value This is the first paper that summarizes the motivations of the rising <b>reshoring</b> phenomenon and interprets them based on an original theory-derived classification framework...|$|E
40|$|A typical {{construction}} {{procedure for}} a multi-storey reinforced concrete building involves supporting newly cast slabs {{on a number}} of previously cast floors through a <b>reshore</b> system. The loads transferred by the forms to the previously cast partially cured supporting slabs may appreciably exceed the design capacity. A further complication is that large early-age construction loads applied to immature slabs will cause large immediate deflections and extensive flexural cracking. The large ratio of applied stress to developed strength, coupled with the low elastic moduli of the immature slabs, will cause significant creep, mostly non-recoverable, resulting in large longterm deflections. Shrinkage, though a non-stress originated concrete deformation phenomena, also affects concrete deformation and needs to be accounted for in calculations to predict longterm deflections. Most cases of deflection damage occur as a result of exceeding the permissible deflection of slabs supporting non-structural elements. This creates serviceability problems such as cracked partitions, jamming of doors and windows, and an uneven placement of furniture. In most cases, the visual impact of cracks and sagging floors may cause concern for safety of the structure even if the structure has adequate strength. Problems related to excessive slab deflection constitutes a serviceability limit state. Current deflection control provisions of the ACI and CSA codes do not address the sensitivity of slab deflections to early-age construction loading and schedule. The present study develops a more realistic span-thickness criterion which includes the effect of early-age construction loads, concrete strength and panel aspect ratio. Undesirable slab deflections can be reduced by appropriately chosen camber in the formwork. The concept is to use a prescribed camber to offset the immediate deflections. An equation is recommended for the estimation of the amount of camber needed for any given span...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reshoring</b> and {{offshoring}} {{have been}} investigated separately by the academic literature, despite their interdependencies. This separation denies the conceptualization of <b>reshoring</b> as a step of the firm internationalization process and undermines a deeper comprehension of the companies’ path of international expansion. Our paper seeks to fill this gap by (1) understanding the interdependencies among the motivations that led to offshore and then to reshore production and (2) exploring whether offshoring and <b>reshoring</b> can be {{considered part of the}} same internationalization strategy. A content-based literature review on offshoring provides the base for the identification of the key motives for offshoring and <b>reshoring,</b> which are then organized using the theory-grounded interpretative framework proposed by Fratocchi et al. (2016). We then conduct a multiple case study analysis based on four companies. The cross case analysis throws light on the links between offshoring and <b>reshoring</b> motives, suggesting that <b>reshoring</b> is a step of a coherent strategy rather than an error correction initiative. Further, cases allow understanding how the analysis of motivations (Why) connects with the How (governance modes), and Where (geographical locations) of offshoring and <b>reshoring.</b> Building on the case findings, the paper presents eight propositions for future empirical research...|$|E
40|$|Offshoring has {{historically}} been the norm for American originated multinational corporations (MNC), to utilize advantages specific for the offshore location, such as low wages. After several years of this trend a new phenomenon has emerged, which possibly can be a new and upcoming trend, called <b>reshoring.</b> <b>Reshoring</b> is the bringing back of an operation from the offshore nation to the country of origin, the ‘home country’. Why is this potential shift taking place? Since no theories are yet formulated purely for <b>reshoring,</b> this thesis will use different classical theories to analyze the <b>reshoring</b> phenomenon, in order to answer the research question “What are the motives behind reshoring?” The classical theories will be used on data found via case studies on <b>reshoring</b> MNCs and manufacturing competitiveness in two countries of focus, China and the United States. This thesis reveals and disregards both rational and irrational motives regarding the decision to reshore. It is concluded that there are motives that can be disregarded, motives that are non-generalizable as well as rational motives that are likely and generalizable for <b>reshoring.</b> However, there are also several irrational motives that are likely and generalizable, and {{when compared with the}} rational, the irrational motives seem to be more dominant.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to find {{possible}} outcomes and enabling factors for <b>reshoring</b> {{in the context of}} apparel supply chains through an extensive literature review. During the last decades, most labor-intensive production has been moved to low-cost countries. A reverse movement called <b>reshoring</b> has recently been observed. Companies have brought back some or all of their production from offshore locations. There are many possible reasons behind this phenomenon. Companies have experienced problems such as quality issues, uncertainty, long lead times, large inventories and hidden costs with offshore production. The most important reasons for <b>reshoring</b> cited in academic literature reviewed for the thesis are quality, flexibility, responsiveness, cost advantage changes, labor costs, transportation costs, control, monitoring and coordinating. The cost gap between low-cost country and developed country manufacturing has decreased. A long lead time can create mismatch costs originating from over-stock or lost sales. Supply and demand can be better balanced with a shorter lead time. The location of target markets is a key factor for achieving flexibility from <b>reshoring.</b> <b>Reshoring</b> is especially fit for time-sensitive products, which have a short selling season. However, as quality is cited as the most important reason for <b>reshoring,</b> there is also potential for <b>reshoring</b> the manufacturing of products that are not time-sensitive. The research in this thesis indicates that there is potential for increasing profitability, quality and customer satisfaction in the <b>reshoring</b> of labor-intensive apparel production...|$|E
40|$|Background: A growing <b>reshoring</b> {{trend has}} {{recently}} been discovered, when companies bring back their manufacturing to the domestic country. <b>Reshoring</b> has received more public attention recently and the interest in <b>reshoring</b> strategies is growing. The knowledge about the <b>reshoring</b> decision is however limited {{and there is not}} a great deal of research addressing this. The knowledge about how companies have performed their cost analysis is limited as well as the risk assessments behind the <b>reshoring</b> decision. Hence, there is a knowledge gap regarding what cost and risk factors that are critical to consider in a <b>reshoring</b> decision. Purpose: The purpose of this master's thesis is to identify critical cost and risk factors to consider in a <b>reshoring</b> decision within Swedish companies. Method: The research design includes a literature review to identify what cost and risk factors that already have been stated. A literature review was essential in order to demonstrate current knowledge in the field. The search included four databases involving several search terms. Since the purpose is to gain a deeper understanding about the phenomenon and to investigate in depth within a real-life context a multiple case study was viewed as a proper method to use. The multiple case study included four companies and was performed using semi structured interviews and investigations of cost analyses and risk assessments.    Findings: This thesis shows that {{there is a great deal}} of factors that are critical in a <b>reshoring</b> decision. However, Coordination, Inventory, Management, Quality and Transportation were the most common cost factors to consider when deciding for <b>reshoring.</b> The most frequent risk factors mentioned by the case companies were Control, Engineering and Innovation and Undesirable reaction. Implications: Different factors are critical depending on what type of company considering the <b>reshoring</b> decision. This is due to deviations in such as products, company strategy, customers and manufacturing techniques. Since each company and each product is unique it is overall important to identify which costs to include in the cost analysis in a <b>reshoring</b> decision for one specific company. The result of the thesis indicates that critical cost factors that are more difficult to measure and compare, so called soft factors, have a great effect on the <b>reshoring</b> decision. Further, companies seem to consider risks with remaining in the offshored country to a higher extent than the risks of <b>reshoring.</b> These risks that appear if not <b>reshoring</b> seem to be of an importance to consider since they generate costs. The findings of the thesis are believed to be evidential to the fact that there is a lack of research since critical factors found in the multiple case study are more than the existing literature indicates...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fierce {{international}} competition drives companies to reconsider {{how to approach}} the global market. Strategies, such as offshoring and outsourcing are commonly implemented to realize cost reduction and better profit performance.

Simultaneously, most of the existing researches investigate the <b>reshoring</b> phenomenon from the perspective of either <b>reshoring</b> initiators’ (western company) or their home country, while few study has been carried on by standing on the host countries’ point of view.        Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to investigate and verify the current existing <b>reshoring</b> drivers, which were suggested based on western manufacturers’ perspective, from Chinese supplier companies’ view. Firstly, the <b>reshoring</b> drivers of the framework will be carefully explored in the cases. Secondly, based on the empirical findings, the similarities and differences comparing with the literature will be presented, and the implications of research findings will be given.      Method: This research is conducted through qualitative case studies of six companies under the deductive methodology. The framework of <b>reshoring</b> drivers is based on comprehensive literature review. The empirical data is collected through semi-structured interviews and secondary data. To have a thorough understanding of our findings, the individual case analyses are the foundation of the final cross-case analysis.      Conclusion: Thirty-three <b>reshoring</b> drivers are investigated and verified from a host country’s perspective. These factors are identified through reviewing 17 peer-reviewed articles and categorized into five dimensions: “Buyer”, “Supplier”, “Home country”, “Host country”, and “Global competitive dynamics” aiming for better understanding the current phenomenon of revoking offshore outsourcing.

40|$|Abstract Purpose – The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} Swedish companies’ motives and difficulties when <b>reshoring.</b> In order to fulfil the purpose, the following two questions were formulated: 1. What are Swedish companies’ motives for <b>reshoring?</b> 2. What difficulties do Swedish companies experience when <b>reshoring?</b> Method – The methods used in the data collection were literature review and case study. The case study consisted of interviews and document studies, which were conducted at four companies that either have reshored or are planning to. The literature review was based on a previously developed model, which were revised and updated. The collected empirical data was then analysed against the theoretical framework and thus formed the findings of this study. Findings – The findings of the study indicates that Swedish companies do not only have one motive or experience one difficulty when <b>reshoring,</b> instead there is a combination of several. Most of the identified motives are connected to the supply chain, and that is because the supply chain was not taken into account when offshoring. The following motives were confirmed by all companies: increased logistics and transportation costs, lack of delivery performance, increased demand for customization, and that innovation/R&D will suffer because of the long distance to production. The most distinctive difficulties Swedish companies experience are: great economic differences between countries, lack of or limited access to qualified personnel in Sweden/the region, lack of access to internal resources such as finance or workforce, limited capacity and difficulties to develop a good basis for decision. Furthermore, the study identified several new motives/difficulties that were not previously identified in the literature. This confirms that the research on <b>reshoring</b> is limited and that more studies are needed to cover the existing gap. Implications – The theoretical implication is that the findings covers a part of the existing research gap on <b>reshoring.</b> The practical implication is that this study contributes to Swedish companies with knowledge of other Swedish companies' <b>reshoring</b> experiences. The study's social implication is that the findings indicates that society must support Swedish companies that wants to reshore by educating people with the required competence. Limitations – Only four companies were investigated, which can be considered as a limitation. If additional companies were studied, more motives and difficulties would likely be confirmed, which would have strengthened the study's findings further.

Fallstudien bestod av intervjuer och dokumentstudier, vilka genomfördes på fyra fallföretag som antingen har eller planerar att reshora. Litteraturstudien utgick från en tidigare framtagen modell som reviderades och uppdaterades. Insamlad empirisk data har därefter analyserats mot det teoretiska ramverket och detta har legat till grund för studiens resultat. Resultat – Studiens resultat visar att svenska företag inte endast har ett motiv till <b>reshoring</b> eller upplever en svårighet i samband med <b>reshoring</b> utan att det är en kombination av flera olika. Flest motiv kopplas till försörjningskedjan, vilket beror på att denna inte beaktades vid offshoringbeslutet. Följande motiv bekräftas av samtliga fallföretag: ökade logistik- och transportkostnader, bristande leveransförmåga, ökat krav på kundanpassning samt att innovation, forskning och utveckling blir lidande på grund av långt avstånd till produktion. De mest utmärkande svårigheterna som identifierats är stora ekonomiska skillnader mellan länder, avsaknad eller begränsad tillgång till kvalificerad personal i Sverige/regionen, bristande tillgång på interna resurser såsom finansiering och arbetskraft, begränsad kapacitet samt svårigheter att ta fram ett bra beslutsunderlag. Vidare identifieras flera nya motiv/svårigheter som inte tidigare identifierats i litteraturen. Detta bekräftar att forskningen om <b>reshoring</b> är begränsad och att fler studier krävs för att täcka det gap som finns. Implikationer – Studiens teoretiska implikation är att resultatet täcker en del av det gap som finns i forskningen kring <b>reshoring.</b> Studiens praktiska implikation är att denna studie bidrar till svenska företag med kunskap om andra svenska företags erfarenheter med <b>reshoring.</b> Studiens sociala implikation är att resultatet visar att samhället måste stödja svenska företag som vill reshora genom att utbilda människor med den kompetens som efterfrågas.

The literature review was conducted to create a theoretical framework of drivers and enablers when <b>reshoring</b> and the case study consisted of interviews and document studies which generated empirical data. This data was analyzed and the theory of <b>reshoring</b> has been developed and updated through the results of this study. Findings – In this study, 19 of the 45 drivers and 7 of the 19 enablers identified in theory are confirmed. The study shows that it is not only one driver or one enabler behind Swedish companies' <b>reshoring</b> decisions, it is a combination of many. The study also identifies 15 new drivers and 12 new enablers to Swedish companies when <b>reshoring.</b> These new drivers and enablers are not considered specific for Swedish companies, but can be seen as general. However, further research is required to confirm this. The study shows that there are major differences in the drivers and enablers for Swedish companies when <b>reshoring,</b> as only four drivers and four enablers are confirmed by more than one case company. Even though the case companies all are manufacturing companies, they differ in several aspects and have different conditions. This has resulted in the study showing a variety of drivers and enablers and that a number of new drivers and enablers have been identified. This confirms that more research of this type, about <b>reshoring</b> in a Swedish context, is needed to identify more drivers and enablers and fill the gap that exists in the theory. Implications – Since research about <b>reshoring</b> is fairly unexplored, the theoretical implications of this study have been to partially fill the gap of knowledge about drivers and enablers, as new ones have been identified at the case companies. However, the study has also contributed with a new dimension as it separates drivers and enablers from one another, something that is not clearly made in the existing theory. Furthermore, a suggestion of how the drivers and enablers can be categorized is presented. From a practical perspective, this study has given companies wishing to reshore, other companies experiences of <b>reshoring.</b> This can facilitate decision making, as decisions to a greater extent can be based on facts rather than gut feeling. This may result in companies becoming more competitive and long-term strengthening their survival. Limitations – The limitations of the study consists of the fact that only three companies were included in the case study and that only one person was interviewed from each case company. Had more companies and more respondents been included in the case study, more drivers and enablers probably would have been identified. Furthermore, the generalization is also limited by the fact that only manufacturing companies have been included in the study. Companies in the service sector have been <b>reshoring,</b> and if any of these companies were included in the study, other drivers and enablers would probably have been identified. Reshorin...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Over {{the last}} couple of decades, {{globalization}} has impacted market competition. This results in that companies heavily offshore to low-wage countries to enhance its competitiveness through lower costs. Offshoring constitutes relocation of manufacturing activities to other existing manufacturing sites in foreign countries. In recent years, low-wage countries have grown and developed. Studies show that low cost environments are increasing in cost, eliminating the benefits of offshoring. This phenomenon has sparked a new trend, ‘reshoring’- to bring back manufacturing to the home country, which has been acknowledged by both researchers and practitioners. The trend has become more distinct due to the increasing numbers of cases where companies that previously offshored manufacturing activities are returning them to the home country. The research done on <b>reshoring</b> focuses mainly on a “why” perspective, with drivers that cause <b>reshoring</b> and barriers that prevent them. However, research concerning the outcomes of what a company expected from <b>reshoring</b> and what they achieved afterwards is limited, especially in the high cost environment of Sweden. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the expected and achieved outcomes of the <b>reshoring</b> process through a multiple case study including four companies from Sweden that have reshored manufacturing back to Sweden. Method: The method used in this thesis was a systematic literature review to gain knowledge of the phenomenon. With the help of the systematic literature review an interview guide was created to assist in the data collection. This thesis used a multiple case study, the data was collected through semi-structured interviews and documents. The findings were analyzed within each case, cross-case, and in comparison to literature. Findings: To analyze the outcomes on the same premises, the researcher had to create a framework. All the outcomes from the literature were categorized based on firms’ operational and competitive capabilities namely cost, quality, delivery, flexibility, service, innovation, environment, culture, risk mitigation, reputation and trust, and government legislations. It was found that all the case companies had a successful <b>reshoring</b> process and all their expected outcomes were achieved. However, in comparison to the expected outcomes found in the literature, the companies expected less from <b>reshoring.</b> The companies were unaware of the full extent of <b>reshoring,</b> since their expectations were limited. The most expected outcome of <b>reshoring,</b> found in all the cases and in theory were: to decrease total cost, increase delivery speed, increase reputation and trust, and use the comfort of the home culture. A thorough analysis of achieved outcomes, in case and in literature, showed that all the case companies have achieved lower total cost, increased delivery speeds and higher reputation and trust. On comparing all the achieved outcomes in case and in literature it is evident that researchers have studied the process of <b>reshoring</b> from a why and theoretical perspective, aside from the effects after the <b>reshoring,</b> which this thesis has accomplished. A comparison between expected and achieved outcomes of all the case companies collectively, showed that they have achieved lower costs, higher quality, better service and higher reputation and trust, beyond what they expected. Implications: <b>Reshoring</b> back to Sweden would bring back more manufacturing jobs and encourage further local sourcing within the country. Strategical collaboration within the supply chain in the home country would make companies more responsive to customer demand. Geographically, the literature lacks case studies from Sweden, therefore, this thesis will contribute to theory by presenting successful <b>reshoring</b> case studies from Swede...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} meaning of <b>reshoring</b> and its drivers {{in the case of}} UK {{manufacturing}} and in particular its automotive sector. Drawing on interviews, policy reviews and a range of recent surveys, the paper finds that while <b>reshoring</b> is a discernable trend in UK manufacturing, it is less pronounced than many have claimed and that – in the UK case at least - there are severe limits as to how far this <b>reshoring</b> trend can go, particularly in relation to the availability of skills and finance in the supply chain. This is in turn raises questions over the stance of British policy and whether more could be done, with comparisons made to US experience...|$|E
40|$|Background An {{increasing}} number of companies in Europe are interested in <b>reshoring</b> the production to their home country. Advantages in other countries, such as low direct wages, {{do not seem to}} play the major role anymore. Companies start to reassess their manufacturing location decision and start to see advantages in having production facilities in their home country and closer to the market. Nevertheless, <b>reshoring</b> is a long-term decision and comes with many factors that must be taken into consideration. Purpose The purpose of this thesis is to show learnings from shortcomings of outsourcing and offshoring decisions, so the shortcomings can be avoided when making <b>reshoring</b> decisions. Based on this together with a deep research of the literature, factors to consider when deciding to reshore should be proposed. These factors should be compared to the results of the empirical research to see their validity and if possible, they should be developed and complemented. Method To answer the research questions, a thorough literature review was crafted and a qualitative case study in form of semi-structured interviews with highly experienced employees of different companies in Sweden, Germany and Switzerland was conducted. The companies were picked based on their location, their industry and their experiences with manufacturing location decisions. The collected data was summarized, discussed and analyzed based on common themes. Conclusion After reviewing a vast amount of literature and empirical material concerning the topic of <b>reshoring,</b> the nature of the <b>reshoring</b> decision became a lot clearer. It is a very complex decision which requires the companies to {{take a close look at}} many different factors, as shown in figure 2. This framework allows companies to have a better overview of the factors influencing their <b>reshoring</b> decision. Since the <b>reshoring</b> decision itself varies quite substantially depending on the company, it is important that companies adapt these factors to their specific needs. Only when considering this step, a correct decision can be ensured. ...|$|E
40|$|Offshoring and {{outsourcing}} {{have the}} last decades occurred as a trend in the manufacturing industry, where many companies have moved to low-cost countries. Several motives can explain this, such as access to cost-effective advantages, closeness to market, and/or to access markets to mention a few. In the last years, a <b>reshoring</b> phenomenon has been observed where companies have moved back activities to its home country, mainly in America. However, {{few studies have been}} made of the <b>reshoring</b> phenomenon and we experience a research gap in Sweden. Our thesis will therefore seek to answer the following question: “How is the attitude among manufacturing firms in Sweden to change their strategies from offshoring and outsourcing to reshoring?” With a qualitative approach, we want to create a deeper understanding of a possible <b>reshoring</b> trend in Sweden, and factors/events that can affect or explain such decisions. The data collection consists of semi-structured interviews with seven larger Swedish manufacturing firms. The interviews were executed with higher managers with knowledge, insight and experience of offshoring and outsourcing. The study is structured to analyse the motive behind the original decisions to move out activities, problematic issues and risks with foreign activities, and future plans of the foreign activities for each firm. This, in order to connect to a possibly <b>reshoring</b> trend. The purpose of the research is to create a holistic picture and we have been inspired of a hermeneutic viewpoint, where we have analysed the research problem from different aspects to create a deep understanding of a possible <b>reshoring</b> trend. The study's conclusions rest on our deductive approach that aimed to connect theory with the collected interview material. The results show that there are several key factors for the current strategies of the firms: closeness to market and customers, costs and concentration factor. These factors are also the main explanation for a non-visibly <b>reshoring</b> trend among Swedish manufacturing firms. Economically some activities are unfeasible to move back home due to closeness to markets and customers in foreign markets, where transportation costs and lead-times are controlling factors. The study also indicates that Sweden lack competitiveness in areas of efficiency and technological products compared to foreign countries. However the empirical data show that most firms though try to protect their activities in Sweden {{as long as they are}} cost effective, and that many firms would like to buy closer to home if would exist competitive alternatives. Furthermore, we see a bigger potential in a future <b>reshoring</b> trend among outsourced activities, than offshore activities. Finally, the study also demonstrates differences from previous studies conducted on <b>reshoring.</b> The main conclusion is that a <b>reshoring</b> trend is not present among the respondents and that the main key controlling variables behind these are: cost-effectiveness, closeness to market and customer, and to focus on core competences. The motives behind the firm decision to offshore activities was of strategically and long-term importance, that still are needed, and will be as long as they want to serve the foreign markets. We also found opportunities for <b>reshoring</b> activities to possibly take place in the future, if certain conditions can be achieved, improved or implemented. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper’s {{interest}} arises {{thanks to}} the intention of fulfilling a gap occasioned {{by the lack of}} research, didactically and empirically, on solving problems concerning dynamics within the Supply Chain. Globalization has promoted an environment that extent and scarce competitiveness, leading companies to move their manufacturing and production tasks away and to take advantages from every location to beat competitors around the world. Now that globalization is settled to stay and even small and medium enterprises have performed offshoring or outsourcing activities to reduce their costs, a new era to stand out has arisen for companies. Enterprises search for new manners to be distinct than competitors and gain share in their markets. As a consequence, during the last years, a new phenomenon, known as <b>reshoring,</b> has been noticed mainly in US and partly in Germany, UK and Italy. The blank in the researches of <b>reshoring</b> activities is more obvious in Europe, especially in Sweden. Therefore, this paper seeks the answer to ‘How do companies with headquarters in Sweden relocate activities?’ in order to verify the existence of any trend, or even the appearance of this new trend regarding location decisions. The study of eight companies has enabled to collect information about companies that are implementing <b>reshoring</b> processes and which were the reasons that guided them to perform the way they did. As the definition of <b>reshoring</b> processes refers to cases where a previous offshoring process has been developed, the study of <b>reshoring</b> is not realized in isolation. It has been collected information regarding the reasons why some companies undertook offshoring processes in the past and how the outcome of that strategy is associated to the current phenomenon. Furthermore, it has been identified the reasons that explain why some companies did not carry out offshoring processes in the past and why those that did have been <b>reshoring</b> in recent years. It has emerged the presence of the Servicification process, which could clarify the manufacturing climate and affect companies’ location decisions in Sweden. In short, the gathering of information has enabled to build an overall picture of the evolution of offshoring and <b>reshoring</b> in the Swedish Industry in terms of size and the causes of this evolution, with the appearance of a possible Regionalization trend in a long-term scenario. The main conclusion is that in the hunt of companies to achieve a right mix of offshore and in-home activities, a <b>reshoring</b> movement is happening between, but it is accompanied by the remaining offshoring trend, which is much larger. Although small, <b>reshoring</b> exists and the main key variables to control the phenomenon are lower costs, proximity to markets, core competences protection and concentration of facilities. The most attractive countries for Swedish companies as a destination to relocate their activities seem to be countries in Eastern Europe. Companies do not perceive the phenomenon as a trend neither they refer to those movements as ‘reshoring’ due to the probable bad feelings and bad popularity that brings ‘coming back’...|$|E
40|$|Much of {{the growing}} body of <b>reshoring</b> {{literature}} has focused on why firms reverse a prior location decision. While valuable, this work needs extending to how the decision to reshore is operationalised. Using a two-stage approach, this paper presents a conceptual framework that covers both why and how firms reshore. The framework also utilises contingency theory to identify {{the factors that influence}} these decisions. It is therefore claimed to be more comprehensive than others frameworks found in the literature. First, a systematic literature review deductively develops an initial framework. Second, a revised version of the framework is presented using evidence from a single, exemplar case of captive <b>reshoring</b> in the textiles industry. The case evidence identifies new factors and extends a typology of <b>reshoring</b> decisions proposed in the literature to more accurately reflect the dynamic, complex, and incremental nature of the onshore-offshore-reshore location and ownership decision...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the rather blurry concept of <b>reshoring</b> and its main drivers and barriers. At the same time, the paper seeks to provide a much-needed {{overview}} of the scientific theories used in previous research on <b>reshoring.</b> Design/methodology/approach The paper gathers information from previous published research. Data were collected through a systematic literature review on “reshoring” using primarily qualitative research techniques. Through a structured keyword search and subsequent elimination of papers, 22 peer-reviewed journal papers made it into the final review. Findings There is currently no consensus on the definition or “theory of reshoring”. Drivers and barriers could be grouped into five different sets of dynamics: global competitive dynamics, home country, host country, supply chain and firm-specific. Research limitations/implications Researchers need to consider the future development of the field and work toward an accepted terminology. Models about <b>reshoring</b> decisions need to include several decision criteria, which goes beyond financial metrics. Practical implications Practitioners need to carefully consider the decision to reshore as to not make rushed decisions. The final decision needs to consider factors such as quality, risk and brand reputation. Originality/value The paper is, to authors’ knowledge, the first overview of earlier research in a research journal. It provides a much-needed overview of an emerging field that can hold great importance for both future research and production. The constructed framework structures the dynamics (drivers and barriers) associated with <b>reshoring...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{the latest}} years {{location}} strategies of firms are gaining growing at-tention {{due to the}} recent rise of <b>reshoring</b> announcements, which cannot be con-sidered just an outcome of new political platforms based on protectionism. Most of them aim at coping with problems determined by unsuccessful offshoring deci-sions. But, when considering how to implement a relocation choice, namely in terms of geographical destination {{and in terms of}} governance of the new manufacturing footprint, several concerns rise and a wide array of relevant factors can be identified, which can drive the effectiveness of a <b>reshoring</b> project. In this setting, offshoring and <b>reshoring</b> can be seen as possible outcomes of a “rightshoring” approach, regarded as the decision making process that leads towards sound location decisions. This paper proposes and empirically tests a theoretical framework according to which factors that should be considered in the location decision making process are the following: 1) strategic alignment; 2) business environment’s factors; 3) firm’s specific factors; 4) contingency factors. The preliminary evidence stemming out from the case-studies supports our framework...|$|E
