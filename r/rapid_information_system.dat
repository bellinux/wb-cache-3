40|$|Human {{society has}} been {{accustomed}} to thinking of natural systems as entities requiring protection or exploitation. There has been much hyberbole in the presentation of both views. Although people have spoken {{of the death of}} nature, it is unlikely that humanity could entirely eliminate all non-domesticated species. Each time human society does something, natural systems adjust, not aIways in ways intended. And, this, in turn, requires human society to adjust. This mutual modification is analogous lo coevolution seen in pairs of species. Coevolution between one species and another is often accomplished through harsh penalties for a component that does not respond rapidly to changes in the other component. A coevolution of human society and natural systems will be less unpleasant to humans if <b>rapid</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are developed to alert society lo needed changes, coupled with a sufficiently high environmental literary to make the changes before the selective pressures of natural systems are too harsh. Instead of polarizing views of human society's relationship with natural systems, to be degree possible, this relationship should be viewed as one system coevolving with another.

40|$|Abstract — This article {{presents}} {{the main features}} of the APIS project that addresses the <b>rapid</b> development of <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> from formal specifications. <b>Information</b> <b>systems</b> are specified using EB 3, a trace-based formal language. The sequences of input events accepted by the system are described with a process algebra; they represent the valid traces of the <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> Entity types, associations and attributes are described using a class diagram and computed by means of recursive functions defined on the valid traces of the system. In the APIS framework, three tools have been developed. A first tool, called DCI-WEB, allows the generation of Web interfaces from GUI specifications. To query and/or to update the system, an end-user can trigger an event through the Web interface. This event is then analyzed by EB 3 PAI, an interpreter for EB 3 process expressions. Finally, the tool EB 3 TG generates, for each EB 3 action, a Java program that executes a relational database transaction. The synthesized transactions implement the specification of the <b>information</b> <b>system’s</b> data structure and are used by the interpreter to update or query the database.

More than 1000 {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) images, which have been acquired by the Second European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS 1 / 2) {{as well as from}} ENVISAT.

Since natural (caused by plankton, ﬁsh, etc.) slicks as well as man-made oil slicks dampen the small-scale surface waves, which are responsible for the radar backscattering from the ocean surface, both types of effects may be confused and give look/alike false oil spill detections. The early SAR images were processed at a resolution of 1 pixel= 200 m and were provided by the <b>RApid</b> <b>Information</b> Dissemination <b>System</b> (RAIDS) SAR processing facility in West Freugh, UK.

The use of different multifractal techniques, both using limits to the smallest and largest available scales, show that the scaling laws are very complex and depend strongly on intermittency of the assumed turbulent cascade, the shapes of the multifractal spectra functions are seen to deviate from an homogeneous multifractal and depend both on the initial conditions of the spill or slick, and on the transit time that the spill has been subjected to the local turbulence...|$|R
