For the 2007–08 season, the change strip was all-white, with a third kit of yellow and black halves available if needed for European games, or {{in the event of a}} clash involving both red and white.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a settlement, Louis {{remained}} in London with his remaining forces, hoping for the arrival of reinforcements from France. When the expected fleet did arrive in August, it was intercepted and defeated by loyalists at the Battle of Sandwich. Louis entered into fresh peace negotiations, and the factions came to agreement on the final Treaty of Lambeth, also known as the Treaty of Kingston, on 12 and 13 September 1217. The treaty was similar to the first peace offer, but excluded the rebel clergy, whose lands and appointments remained forfeit; it included a promise, however, that Louis' followers would be allowed to enjoy their traditional liberties and customs, <b>referring</b> <b>back</b> to the Charter of 1216. Louis left England as agreed and joined the Albigensian Crusade in the south of France, bringing the war to an end.|$|E
5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than <b>referring</b> <b>back</b> to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E

25|$|Britannica by the 6th edition {{was in some}} regards hopelessly out of date. The {{supplement}} to the 3rd edition contained updates which {{were not included in}} it, and which had become dated themselves anyway, the 4th edition expanded the text somewhat but revised very little, and the 5th and 6th were just reprints of the 4th. The {{supplement to}} the 4th/5th/6th edition addressed the issue of updates in a clumsy way, often <b>referring</b> <b>back</b> to the encyclopedia, essentially making the reader look everything up twice. What was needed was a completely new edition from the ground up. This was to be accomplished with the magnificent 7th edition.|$|E

25|$|On January 7, all Russian {{gas flow}} through Ukraine was halted, {{completely}} cutting off supplies to Southeastern Europe, {{much of which}} is completely reliant on Russian gas, and partially {{to other parts of}} Europe. Miller stated that Gazprom had stopped all gas deliveries to Ukraine because Ukraine had closed the system down, but Naftogaz said it closed down the system because Gazprom had stopped delivering gas. According to an official statement by Gazprom, Ukraine was sabotaging the transit of gas to European countries and had practically declared a gas blockade of Europe. Prime Minister Putin accused Ukraine of blackmail, <b>referring</b> <b>back</b> to the letter Naftogaz sent to Gazprom on December 30 which threatened to confiscate European bound gas if no contract was in place. Ukraine denied the charges and blamed Russia for stopping gas deliveries to Europe. According to the Ukrainian presidential envoy for international energy security, Bohdan Sokolovsky, Ukraine had no technical capability to stop the pumping of Russian gas into its territory. He claimed that all pumping stations through which gas is supplied to Ukraine are located in Russia.|$|E
25|$|Darul Uloom Deoband, next to al-Azhar one of {{the most}} {{influential}} madrasas, was founded in the city of Deoband, Uttar Pradesh, in 1867. Initially, the intention of the school was to help Indian Muslims, who had become subjects of the British Empire after 1857, to lead their lives according to Islamic law. The Deobandi propagate a Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school, which was the most prevalent madhhab in South Asia. Still today, they aim at a revival of the Islamic society and education. Following the example of Deoband, thousands of madrasas were founded during the late 19th century which adopted the Deobandi way of studying fundamental texts of Islam and commenting on Quran and Hadith. By <b>referring</b> <b>back</b> to traditional Islamic scholars, the Deobandi School aims at defending the traditional Islamic madhhab, especially the Hanafi, against criticism which arose from other Islamic schools like the Ahl-i Hadith. During the 1990s, the Afghan taliban also referred to the Deoband School. Ashraf Ali Thanwi (1863–1943) is {{one of the}} most prominent teachers of Darul Uloom Deoband. Thanwi initiated and edited mulit-volume encyclopedic commentaries on the Quran. However, he was also able to reach out to a larger audience: His book Bahishti Zewar, which is still widely read in South Asia, as it details, amongst other topics, the proper conduct and beliefs for Muslim women.|$|E

He similarly ignored Gray’s suggestion in the same letter, <b>referring</b> <b>back</b> to his own alternative versions in earlier drafts of his poem: “Might not the English characters here be romanized? Virgil is {{just as good as}} Milton, and Cæsar as Cromwell, but who shall be Hampden?” Again, however, other Latin translators, especially those from outside Britain, found Gray’s suggested alternative more appealing.|$|E

500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{dismissed}} {{suggestions that}} his team had been over physical in previous meetings against Arsenal. <b>Referring</b> <b>back</b> to the league fixture in October 2004, he told reporters: [...] "We committed three fouls on Reyes, for instance, but that hardly constitutes The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, does it? There were six by them on Cristiano Ronaldo." [...] He questioned the character of Arsenal's players after they lost their unbeaten record, and likened their protest to propaganda, {{as a way to}} disguise their crisis – [...] "...it was convenient for them to say they were kicked off the park." [...] United had struggled to score goals in the lead up to the final, and Ferguson stressed the importance of his team taking their chances. [...] "Big games are usually decided that way. They are so close so that whoever gets in front has an advantage," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Taborn's {{range of}} playing styles was {{summarized}} by Mike Hobart in The Financial Times: Taborn [...] "draws obliquely on the jazz tradition [...] {{he is as}} at home in free improvisation as he is in composition". In an interview for Down Beat in 2011, Taborn described his improvising style, particularly for solo piano. When playing, he often adopts a modular approach, using small units of melody and rhythm and then developing them. This can begin from as little as three notes, with structure being built around <b>referring</b> <b>back</b> to elements of the units. He starts simply, using basic elements such as major and minor thirds, varies them in turn, and then continues to expand to create larger structures. He uses a combination of his attack and the piano's sustain pedal {{to draw attention to}} the upper partials of a note; this allows a heightened contrast between notes to be perceived.|$|E
500|$|This {{painting}} exemplifies Lichtenstein's {{use of the}} background/foreground {{shift and}} ironic colloquialisms in critical commands. Although most of Lichtenstein's war imagery depicts American war themes, this depicts [...] "a scarred German submarine captain at a battle station". The manner of depiction with the commander's face pressed against the periscope reflects fusions of industrial art of the 1920s and 1930s. [...] The ironic aspect of this in 1963 is {{in part due to}} its temporal displacement <b>referring</b> <b>back</b> to World War II during the much later period of the Cold War. The styling of the balloon content, especially that of the large font characters, is complemented by or complementary to the other traditional visual content of the painting. Lichtenstein's alterations heightened the sense of urgency in the image, however, they also offset that menace by forming a detached work. A November 1963 Art Magazine review stated that {{this was one of the}} [...] "broad and powerful paintings" [...] of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Mountain States Legal Foundation (foundation) and the Rock Springs Grazing Association (association) won a writ of {{mandamus}} by the District Court requiring the BLM {{to remove all}} horses from the private lands of the [...] "checkerboard" [...] of private and public lands grazed by the association, and {{to reduce the number}} of horses on the public lands. [...] The District Court, however issued a summary judgement for the government against the contention that feral horses who ate grass or drank water on privately owned lands had [...] "taken" [...] these resources from the ranchers in violation of the [...] "takings clause" [...] of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the government must compensate the private landowners $500,000. [...] The foundation appealed the summary judgement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In Mountain States Legal Foundation v. Hodel, 799 F.2d 1423 (1986), cert. den'd. 480 U.S. 951 (1987), the appeals court remanded the summary judgement back to the district court, which ultimately ruled that a wild animal was not an [...] "agent" [...] of the federal government and hence could not be found guilty of [...] "taking" [...] the ranchers' grass or water. [...] However, in 2000, the [...] "takings" [...] argument was brought up again, this time in Bradshaw v. United States U.S. Court of Federal Claims 47 Fed.Cl. 549 (Sept. 15, 2000) wherein the plaintiffs held that free-roaming horses were taking forage that they paid for with their grazing permit, and the horses were drinking water from springs for which they owned the water rights.
