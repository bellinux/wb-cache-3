The short-term abnormalities centrally had appeared in the 6 months to 1 year period before the earthquake near and in the neighborhood of the source region, demonstrating a significantly increased number of short-term abnormalities. Many sites near and in the neighborhood of the source region had strengthened inverse activities or had changed from positive to inverse activities in the most recent 2 – 3 years, which reflect stress-field enhancements or adjustment features...|$|R

50|$|Crop water {{productivity}} (WP) or water use efficiency (WUE) expressed in kg/m³ is an efficiency term, expressing {{the amount of}} marketable product (e.g. kilograms of grain) {{in relation to the}} amount of input needed to produce that output (cubic meters of water). The water used for crop production is referred to as crop evapotranspiration. This is a combination of water lost by evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration by the plant, occurring simultaneously. Except by modeling, distinguishing between the two processes is difficult. <b>Representative</b> <b>values</b> of WUE for cereals at field level, expressed with evapotranspiration in the denominator, can vary between 0.10 and 4 kg/m3.|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} types of load in {{distribution}} system. The load value that represents the varying load with time is needed to be estimated for reconfiguration because the system is reconfigured in non-real time. Specially, as the power system develops as the smart grid, the amount of distributed generations is increased. Since the variability of distributed generations’ output is higher compared to normal generations, {{it is important that}} which <b>representative</b> <b>value</b> is used for variable output when an algorithm performs. In addition, the reversed current caused by distributed generation should be considered. In this paper, we propose a method to choose <b>representative</b> <b>value</b> considering distribution generation and variable load and also a constraint considering the reversed current. By this method, we study the distribution system reconfiguration for reliable and efficient operating...|$|R

50|$|In the BGIT, {{we assumed}} that a CH2 always makes a {{constant}} contribution to △Hf0 for a molecule. However, a small ring such as cyclobutane leads to a substantial failure for the BGIT, because of its strain energy. A series of correction terms for common ring systems has been developed, {{with the goal of}} obtaining accurate △Hf0 values for cyclic system. <b>Representative</b> <b>values</b> are given in the Table shown below. Note that these are not identically equal to the accepted strain energies for the parent ring system, although they are quite close. The group increment correction for a cyclobutane is based on △Hf0 values for a number of structures, and represents an average value that gives the best agreement with the range of experimental data. In contrast, the strain energy of cyclobutane is specific to the parent compound, with their new corrections, it is now possible to predict △Hf0 values for strained ring system, by first adding up all the basic group increments and then adding appropriate ring strain correction values.|$|E
50|$|The Gini {{coefficient}} {{measures the}} inequality among {{values of a}} frequency distribution (for example, levels of income). A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (for example, where everyone has the same income). A Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality among values (e.g., for {{a large number of}} people, where only one person has all the income or consumption, and all others have none, the Gini coefficient will be very nearly one). However, a value greater than one may occur if some persons represent negative contribution to the total (for example, having negative income or wealth). For larger groups, values close to or above 1 are very unlikely in practice. Given the normalization of both the cumulative population and the cumulative share of income used to calculate the Gini coefficient, the measure is not overly sensitive to the specifics of the income distribution, but rather only on how incomes vary relative to the other members of a population. The exception to this is in the redistribution of wealth resulting in a minimum income for all people. When the population is sorted, if their income distribution were to approximate a well-known function, then some <b>representative</b> <b>values</b> could be calculated.|$|E
