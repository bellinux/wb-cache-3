5|$|Renal <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> may be {{required}} to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver transplantation, although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used. The use of dialysis, however, does not lead to recuperation or preservation of kidney function in patients with HRS, and is essentially only used to avoid complications of kidney failure until transplantation can take place. In patients who undergo hemodialysis, there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to low blood pressure in patients with HRS, although appropriate studies have yet to be performed. As a result, the role of renal <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> in patients with HRS remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|In ESRD, some {{eventually}} need hemodialysis {{or equivalent}} renal <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> (RRT). If a kidney transplant is found {{for a patient}} on RRT, the disease will recur in the graft (transplanted kidney) in about 35% of cases, and in 11%, the graft will fail completely (requiring resumption of the RRT and a further transplant).|$|E

40|$|Autologous-induced {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} (iPSCs) may eventually be used in cell <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> to treat {{a wide range of}} diseases and have been touted as a solution to the vexing problem of immune rejection in this context. Emerging evidence suggests, however, that ostensibly histocompatible iPSCs may be rejected following transplantation. Here, we review the mechanisms that contribute to immunogenicity in iPSCs and forward approaches to permit their acceptance in potential cell <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the initial}} stages, {{electrolyte}} levels are often abnormal and require correction. High potassium levels can be life-threatening, {{and respond to}} increased urine production and renal <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> (see below). Temporary measures include the administration of calcium to protect against cardiac complications, insulin or salbutamol to redistribute potassium into cells, and infusions of bicarbonate solution.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} for erectile dysfunction to exist not {{as a direct result}} of SCI but due to factors such as major depression, diabetes, or drugs such as those taken for spasticity. Finding and treating the root cause may alleviate the problem. For example, men who experience erectile problems as the result of a testosterone deficiency can receive androgen <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{dysfunction}} typically develops 1–2days {{after the}} initial muscle damage. If supportive treatment is inadequate to manage this, renal <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> (RRT) may be required. RRT removes excess potassium, acid and phosphate that accumulate when the kidneys are unable to function normally and is required until kidney function is regained.|$|E
40|$|Online {{monitoring}} {{in continuous}} renal <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies.</b> Technical improvements in dialysis equipment for chronic hemodialysis patients has mirrored improvements in continuous renal <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> (CRRTs) {{for patients with}} acute renal failure who are critically ill. This article reviews the available types and importance of online monitors such as urea sensors to provide real-time urea kinetic parameters, temperature sensors to target thermal balance throughout each session, conductivity measurement of sodium balance in the dialysate, blood volume monitoring to aid against cardiovascular instability and treatment-induced hypotension, biofeedback systems, and remote dialysis/teledialysis for efficient use of trained personnel...|$|R
40|$|Background. Renal <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> {{with high}} cut-off haemofilters are new {{approaches}} in the adju-vant therapy of sepsis. We analysed the cytokine elimination {{capacity of a}} newly developed polyflux high cut-off haemofilter. Different renal <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> are compared and tested for their clinical feasibility. Methods. Blood from healthy volunteers (ns 15) was incubated for 4 h with 1 mg of endotoxin and then circulated through a closed extracorporeal circuit. A newly developed polyflux haemofilter (P 2 SX) was used. Haemofiltration, haemodialysis and albumin dialysis were tested. IL- 1 ra (17 kDa), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) (28 kDa), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a...|$|R

5|$|Long-term {{usage of}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{is associated with}} a reduced likelihood of developing AD. Evidence also supports the notion that NSAIDs can reduce inflammation related to amyloid plaques. No prevention trial has been completed. They {{do not appear to be}} useful as a treatment. Hormone <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy,</b> although previously used, may increase the risk of dementia.|$|E
5|$|The female hormone estrogen, {{when used}} in the {{combined}} oral contraceptive pill and in perimenopausal hormone <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy,</b> {{has been associated with}} a two- to sixfold increased risk of venous thrombosis. The risk depends on the type of hormones used, the dose of estrogen, and the presence of other thrombophilic risk factors. Various mechanisms, such as deficiency of protein S and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, are said to be responsible.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{was born}} on November 3, 1982 in Oklahoma. He attends Smith College, a private, women-only college in Massachusetts. Lucas is a {{neuroscience}} major in his senior year; he has fought for transgender rights for his entire college career. He has not yet started hormone <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy,</b> and is cautious about it. Lucas' parents are divorced; his mother and brother {{know that he is}} trans, but his father does not. Lucas plays guitar in a punk band, and lives in an apartment with his friend Kasey, a trans man who has been on HRT for eight months.|$|E
5000|$|Consumers of e-cigarettes, {{sometimes}} called [...] "vapers", have shown passionate support for e-cigarettes that other nicotine <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> did not receive.

5|$|Manning is a trans woman who, in a {{statement}} the day after sentencing, {{said she had a}} female gender identity since childhood, wanted to be known as Chelsea, and desired to begin hormone <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy.</b> Reaction to Manning's disclosures, arrest, and sentence was mixed. Her biographer, Denver Nicks, writes that the leaked diplomatic cables were seen by some (but disputed by others) as a catalyst for the Arab Spring that began in December 2010, and that she was viewed by some as a 21st-century Tiananmen Square Tank Man and by others as an embittered traitor.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are {{insensitive to the}} effects of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis can be seen during pregnancy. Acne can be a side effect of testosterone <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> or of anabolic steroid use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added anabolic steroids.|$|E
5|$|The Sale of Food (Prohibition of Chewing Gum) Regulations {{made under}} the Sale of Food Act prohibits the sale or {{advertisement}} for sale of any chewing gum. The prohibition {{does not apply}} to the sale or advertisement of any chewing gum in respect of which a product licence has been granted under the Medicines Act. Thus, it is now possible to purchase chewing gum for dental or medical purposes (for instance, for the purpose of nicotine <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy)</b> from pharmacies without a prescription.|$|E
50|$|NNN can be {{produced}} in the acidic environment of the stomach in users of oral nicotine <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies,</b> due to the combination of dietary/endogenous nitrates, and nornicotine(either present as a minor metabolite of nicotine, or as an impurity in the product).|$|R
40|$|Abuse of psychostimulants such as {{cocaine and}} amphet-amines has a {{tremendous}} social and economic impact. Al-though <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> are offered for addiction to opi-oids, nicotine, and alcohol, there is no approved replacement treatment for psychostimulant addiction. Recent studies on an emerging group of benztropine- and rimcazole-based com-pounds provide hope that <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> for cocaine and amphetamine addiction may come in the near future. A new study (p. 813) now investigates the molecular interaction of the benztropine and rimcazole compounds with their target, the dopamine transporter, and provides an intriguing explanation as to why use of these compounds, unlike cocaine, do not lead to locomotor stimulation and drug discrimination behaviors in animal models...|$|R
25|$|Moisture <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> such as {{artificial}} tears may ease {{the symptoms of}} dry eyes. Some patients with more severe problems use goggles to increase local humidity or have punctal plugs inserted to help retain tears on the ocular surface for a longer time.|$|R
5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy,</b> but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy.</b> The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E

5|$|North Korea {{has set up}} {{specific}} government {{objectives for}} tobacco control {{and there is a}} national agency to implement them, with eight full-time staff members. Although there is no free of charge smoking cessation quitline that callers could phone and discuss their problems, most health-care facilities offer support in cessation, including cessation programs and nicotine <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy.</b> Costs are covered for the patient partially or in full by the state. In addition to regular health-care clinics, there are 11 specialized anti-smoking centers in the country where consultation is free, but medicine is not. Of medicines, bupropion and varenicline are not legally available in North Korea, but herbal medicines are used as smoking cessation aids.|$|E
5|$|Products {{collected}} from living horses include mare's milk, used {{by people with}} large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis. Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. Drinking their own horses' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for {{extended periods of time}} without stopping to eat. The drug Premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy.</b> The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.|$|E
