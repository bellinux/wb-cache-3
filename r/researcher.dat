30|$|Considering the {{selected}} <b>researchers,</b> {{we have identified}} each joint publication from DBLP, that is, a publication in which at least two young <b>researchers</b> could be counted as authors. In average, young <b>researchers</b> have published papers with five other <b>researchers</b> pertaining to {{the selected}} group. This is a very polarized sample, comprised of 10 <b>researchers</b> (including most of the topmost ones from our graph analysis) who have interacted with 9 or more <b>researchers</b> from the selected group, while the remaining has interacted {{with just a few}} (up to four) <b>researchers.</b> When considering only the <b>researchers</b> they have indicated, the selected <b>researchers</b> have published, in average, with two of their nominees.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{disciplinary}} {{differences in}} how <b>researchers</b> use the microblogging site Twitter. Tweets from <b>researchers</b> in five disciplines (astrophysics, biochemistry, digital humanities, economics, and history of science) were collected and analyzed both statistically and qualitatively. The results suggest that <b>researchers</b> tend to share more links and retweet {{more than the average}} Twitter users in earlier research. The results also suggest that there are clear disciplinary {{differences in how}} <b>researchers</b> use Twitter. Biochemists retweet substantially more than <b>researchers</b> in the other disciplines. <b>Researchers</b> in digital humanities use Twitter more for conversations, while <b>researchers</b> in economics share more links than other <b>researchers.</b> The results also suggest that <b>researchers</b> in biochemistry, astrophysics and digital humanities are using Twitter for scholarly communication, while scientific use of Twitter in economics and history of science is marginal...|$|R

40|$|Qualitative {{research}} {{is a research}} method studying subjective meaning of participants world about an object researched. Steps of qualitative research in psychology are: <b>researchers</b> select research topic, <b>researchers</b> formulate research questions, <b>researchers</b> design the study, <b>researchers</b> collect data, <b>researchers</b> analyses data, <b>researchers</b> generate findings, <b>researchers</b> validate findings, and <b>researchers</b> write research report. Some of the qualitative research designs are grounded research, phenomenology research, case study research, and ethnography research. In some situations, <b>researchers</b> often meet questions that reach beyond the prescription of the APA ethical guidelines concerning human participants. <b>Researchers</b> of qualitative research in psychology can generalize their research findings to other people, times, or treatments to {{the degree to which}} they are similar to other people, times, or treatments in the original research (naturalistic generalization). There are some strategies for expanding qualitative research as a research approach so the methodology can be accepted as one significant method in understanding psychological phenomena...|$|R
30|$|Second, {{the results}} of this study are based on {{eighteen}} interviews with leading Dutch nanotechnology <b>researchers.</b> It would be interesting to study how different dimensions of proximity affect dynamics in research collaborations of more junior <b>researchers</b> and <b>researchers</b> in different network positions (i.e., <b>researchers</b> outside of the largest connected component or <b>researchers</b> at the global top or bottom in terms of centrality). We suggest that more central <b>researchers</b> are most likely best able to ‘use’ personal and other kinds of proximity in their relationships to full effect. Furthermore, future research may want to benchmark our results to different cohorts of <b>researchers</b> in different knowledge fields.|$|R

5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the <b>researcher</b> intends to investigate. For example, a <b>researcher</b> {{concerned}} with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a <b>researcher</b> who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E

However, the impact of individual <b>researchers</b> in collaboration networks has not been investigated systematically. We introduce a new method of measuring the contribution of <b>researchers</b> to the connectivity of collaboration networks and evaluate the importance of <b>researchers</b> by considering both contribution and productivity. Betweenness centrality is found to be better than degree centrality in terms of reflecting the changes of importance of <b>researchers.</b> Accordingly, a method is further proposed to identify key <b>researchers</b> at certain periods. The performance of the identified <b>researchers</b> demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R

30|$|The key {{findings}} {{of the present study}} are, first, that male <b>researchers</b> managed more graduate students than female <b>researchers.</b> We assume that {{this is due to the}} relatively higher proportion of research funding that is given to male <b>researchers,</b> as well as the social tendency to recognize the research output of males more than that of females. Second, we found that senior <b>researchers</b> had more graduate students, than junior <b>researchers</b> only in humanities and social sciences. Third, <b>researchers</b> from capital areas had more support for their research, and managed more graduate students, than <b>researchers</b> from non-capital areas. Last, the number of graduate students managed was found to be associated with significant differences in researchers’ output, as measured by both KCI and SCI scores.|$|R
