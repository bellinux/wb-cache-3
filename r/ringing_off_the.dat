It was heavy, an arm was foul of something, and they could not drag it clear, until a dim object appeared close by.|$|E

Spike lacks sympathy for Wesley, since he himself killed his mother while she was hitting on him. “Well…that explains a lot,” Harmony remarks. She opens a package for Spike from an unknown source, producing a flash of light. When Harmony goes to answer the phone, she’s greeted by electronic screeching.

5000|$|These ten {{students}} {{entered into}} a tense but mostly peaceful situation at Mayfield High School {{in the fall of}} 1956. Looking back on those days, Alice Wilson remembered: [...] "They were absolutely shocked that we had walked in, and we did register; and I'm sure the telephones were <b>ringing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> hook for that one. Because, of course, it involved the teachers there, it involved, I'm sure, City Council, how they were gonna handle this situation. I'm sure it threw everybody into turmoil, but it wasn't blocked. It was not blocked by those, the City Council, and those who were making decisions at the time." [...] This was not the usual case - many other integration procedures did not go this smoothly. The integration of the white high school in nearby Sturgis, Kentucky, garnered international attention due to the white supremacist resistance.Alice Wilson described going in to register for admission to the all-white high school: [...] "I don't remember being afraid in the office. We weren't made to feel that way. But the atmosphere was that no one really knew what to do. Whether they should go ahead and register us, or wait until there was some decision, perhaps from the Board at that time. They didn't really know what to do. But we registered, and then the whole process began."The integration was optional, and for the first time, the students had the option to choose between Dunbar [...] "Colored" [...] High School and Mayfield High School. Following the Brown v. Board of Education decision, the Mayfield Ten chose to go to Mayfield High School to expand their opportunities, gain access to better materials, and to broaden their educations. They knew they were getting a better education at the all-white school, even though it was difficult on a day-to-day basis. Only two of the Mayfield Ten graduated on time - the others [...] "had to repeat a grade, or they failed, or they didn't catch up quite as quickly, or whatever." ...|$|E

50|$|The fuse {{is set for}} a {{predetermined}} time by rotation of a time ring in {{the lower part of}} the fuze. On firing, set-back causes the time-train firing pin to function.

Thus the fuze will function on impact if impact occurs before expiration of the set time. The time-setting can be eliminated altogether by turning <b>the</b> setting <b>ring</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> scale. It should be noted that the fuze is not interchangeable with fuzes used in other 8 cm mortar ammunition.|$|R
