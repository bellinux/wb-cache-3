5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E

25|$|The early 0-6-0 tank engines were {{fitted with}} either saddle tanks (wrapped over the boiler) or side tanks (mounted {{at the side}} of the boiler and <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> to the running platform). GWR first fitted pannier tanks (mounted on the side of the boiler but not <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> to the running platform) in 1898 to nine 4-4-0 tank {{locomotives}} and, in 1901, to five 0-6-0T locomotives which were also fitted with Belpaire fireboxes. The shape of the Belpaire firebox gives a larger surface area which improves heat transfer and steam production, but their rectangular shape made them difficult to combine with saddle tanks. Locomotives fitted with pannier tanks have a lower centre of gravity than those with saddle tanks (enabling higher speeds on curves), and access for maintenance is easier than for those fitted with side tanks.|$|E

It may also symbolize the Tribes of Israel and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a woman wearing a crown of twelve stars. It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|Hundley {{was hurt}} on UCLA's second {{possession}} of the game with 4:29 remaining {{in the first quarter}} when he landed awkwardly after <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> at the Bruins 35 while being tackled after an 11-yard run to convert a third-and-nine. UCLA scored its first TD on the opening drive of the second half, going 75 yards on seven plays. Perkins began the drive with a 58-yard run, which led to the Neuheisel's game-tying 3-yard pass to Nate Iese. Texas went ahead with 5:13 left in the game when quarterback Tyrone Swoopes connected with John Harris on an 8-yard TD pass. The Longhorns then recovered a fumble, but the UCLA defense forced a punt after three plays. UCLA's Adams returned the kick 58 yards, which set up Neuheisel's game-winning toss on the following play.|$|E
25|$|Modelling {{indicates}} {{a system where}} andesitic melts coming from the mantle rise through the crust and generate a zone of mafic volcanism. Increases in the melt flux and thus heat and volatile input causes partial melting of the crust, forming a layer containing melts <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> to the Moho that inhibits the ascent of mafic magmas because of its higher buoyancy. Instead, melts generated in this zone eventually reach the surface, generating felsic volcanism. Some mafic magmas escape sideward after stalling in the melt containing zone; these generate more mafic volcanic systems {{at the edge of}} the felsic volcanism, such as Cerro Bitiche. The magmas are mixtures of crust derived and mafic mantle-derived melts with a consistent petrological and chemical signature. The melt generation process may involve several different layers in the crust.|$|E

500|$|The {{earth is}} {{represented}} by the narrow area between heaven and hell. The passage shows the resurrection of the dead as the fires of the last day rage. The dead rise from their graves to the left and from the stormy sea to the right. The Archangel Michael stands on death's shoulders, the largest figure in the painting, whose body and wings span the entire pictorial space. Michael wears jewel-studded golden armour and has curly blond hair and multicoloured wings similar to those seen in the donor panel of van Eyck's 1437 Dresden Triptych of the Virgin and Child. Michael appears, according to Smith, [...] "like a giant on the earth, whose crust is revealed to be the wings of the skeletal figure of Death. The damned are excreted though Death's bowels into the dark slime of hell." [...] The bat-like death figure, with skull extruding up to earth and skeletal arms and legs <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> into hell, is the protagonist of the narrative according to Pächt, but death is vanquished by the slim and youthful looking archangel standing between the horrors of hell and the promise of heaven.|$|E

500|$|The train departs {{the station}} {{to the right and}} climbs a small lift leading to a short drop, then circles around to the [...] lift hill, {{carrying}} the riders into the [...] mountain. It is the tallest attraction at Walt Disney World, beating The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror by 6 inches. Disney keeps it just under 200 feet because law requires structures 200 feet or taller to have a blinking red light as a beacon for low-flying planes, which Disney feels would take parkgoers out of the experience. On the way up it passes through a ransacked temple with murals of the yeti, warning the riders that the mountain is his territory. At {{the top of the mountain}} the train curves around the main peak and goes through a cave. When it emerges, it draws to a halt in front of track that has been torn apart, presumably by the yeti. The train itself is held in place by a series of rubber tires while an automatic switch rotates the piece of track directly behind the train. The train then rolls backwards along a new route that spirals down through the mountain, coming to a halt in a large cave, where riders see the yeti's shadow on the wall as he tears up more track. This effect distracts riders from noticing another automatic track switch rotates in front of them. As the shadow moves away, the train rolls forward out of the mountain and down the main [...] drop. It enters a 250° turn and speeds back up through another cave in the mountain, where the roars of the yeti are heard once more. The train exits from the rear of the mountain and enters a large helix before being lifted back into the mountain a final time. The train drops through a cave, where the yeti is <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> toward it. On reaching the bottom of this drop, riders return to the unloading dock and depart into a gift shop. One ride takes about 2 minutes and 50 seconds.|$|E

2500|$|To {{achieve the}} {{national}} goal {{of economic and}} social progress with prosperity <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> to the masses, there existed a choice of methods. First, there was the choice between the democratic and dictatorial systems, the latter prevailing in Communist countries. On this, the choice was easy as Filipinos had long been committed to the democratic method. With the democratic mechanism, however, the next choice was between free enterprise and the continuing of the controls system. Macapagal stated the essence of free enterprise in layman parlance in declaring before Congress on January 22, 1962 that [...] "the task of economic development belongs principally to private enterprise and not to the government.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Orlik is a semi-monocoque of deep oval cross-section, tapering to the tail.

[...] Its tail is conventional with a straight-edged, ply-covered and foam-filled all-moving tailplane, fitted with an anti-balance tab, mounted on top of the fuselage and ahead of the small fin which is constructed in the same way. The fabric-covered, balanced rudder is broad and taller than the fin, <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> to the keel. Overall, the vertical tail has almost upright straight edges and a blunt tip. [...] The Orlik has a fixed, semi-recessed monowheel ahead of the wing leading edge, assisted by a small tail bumper.|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{doctrine}} of continuing revelation, Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day [...] "prophet, seer, and revelator" [...] and that Jesus Christ, {{under the direction of}} God the Father, leads the church by revealing his will to its president. The current president is Thomas S. Monson. Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives. The president heads a hierarchical structure with various levels <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> to local congregations. Bishops, drawn from the laity, lead local congregations. Male members, after reaching age 12, may be ordained to the priesthood, provided they are living the standards of the church.

2500|$|No {{physical}} description of Jesus {{is contained in}} any of the canonical Gospels. [...] In the Acts of the Apostles, Jesus is said to have manifested as a [...] "light from heaven" [...] that temporarily blinded the Apostle Paul, but no specific form is given.

[...] (Revelation 1:12–16, NIV). Use in art of the Revelation description of Jesus has generally been restricted to illustrations of the book itself, and nothing in the scripture confirms the spiritual form's resemblance to the physical form Jesus took in his life on Earth.|$|E
