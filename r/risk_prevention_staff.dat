40|$|Engineering syllabuses {{often lack}} courses {{covering}} occupational <b>risk</b> <b>prevention.</b> In Spain, professional competences are awarded {{along with the}} completion of a university degree. This means that new graduates are certified in areas where they have received little or no training, such as occupational <b>risk</b> <b>prevention.</b> However, the academic reforms established by the Bologna Process, which strives to homogenize university degrees throughout Europe, compels European universities to design new syllabuses. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} define a framework for including occupational <b>risk</b> <b>prevention</b> education in the new engineering syllabuses. This exploratory research applied the Delphi methodology to a panel of 59 experts using questionnaires assessed with a four-point Likert scale through two rounds. A Web site supported all the information flow. According to the experts who participated in this study, education and training in occupational <b>risk</b> <b>prevention</b> is essential for improving the safety culture within a company or workplace. They concurred that this subject should be a separate mandatory course in all engineering degree programs. The participants recommended that an optional course should be considered only if a mandatory course is not approved.

40|$|An {{online survey}} was {{conducted}} to describe stakeholders' perceptions, attitudes and practices towards <b>risk</b> <b>prevention</b> in the food chain and to explore if common features could be extracted from different fields of competency or groups of stakeholders. Out of 80 participants, 60 % believed that pathogenic microorganisms were the main hazard to prevent. Twenty-four percent perceived climate change as the main risk factor. Seventy-three percent believed that hazards in the food chain are preventable and they often showed a positive attitude towards <b>risk</b> <b>prevention</b> measures. The opinion of 75 % of stakeholders was that prevention measures should be compulsory and under the shared responsibility of both food business operators and competent authority. Seventy-five {{percent of the respondents}} had recent experience with particular hazards and declared to have undertaken risk reduction measures. Incentives to implement measures were policy obligation and public health consequences whereas barriers were budgetary reasons and doubts about their effectiveness. However, there was not always a complete agreement between the perceived usefulness of <b>risk</b> <b>prevention</b> measures and their effective implementation, and conversely. No significant difference could be observed in the perceptions, attitudes and practices towards <b>risk</b> <b>prevention</b> between neither groups of stakeholders nor their fields of competency. The results are important for improving the risk communication process because the same issues can be emphasized when promoting <b>risk</b> <b>prevention</b> in the food chain regardless of the type of food sectors and the groups of stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIndustrial {{activity}} {{is both an}} economic lung for a region and a risk generator for {{the people living in}} the vicinity of a site. In France, the Toulouse accident highlighted the need to revise the way in which urbanisation control is carried out around industrial sites. Thus, the new law No 2003 - 699 of 30 July 2003 about the 'prevention of technological and natural risks and the compensation of the damages' has established Technological <b>Risk</b> <b>Prevention</b> Plans (TRPP). These plans aim at reducing vulnerability around Seveso sites by considering the kinetics, the probability and the intensity of the dreaded events. As technical support to decision-makers in <b>risk</b> <b>prevention</b> from both public and private sectors, INERIS has {{played an important role in}} the evolution of the French <b>risk</b> <b>prevention</b> plan.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of <b>risks</b> <b>prevention</b> plans frequently causes lively debates between state services (which conduct <b>risks</b> <b>prevention</b> plans and prior hazards studies) and relevant territorial authorities. The {{development of}} coastal <b>risks</b> <b>prevention</b> plans, identified as priorities after Xynthia storm in 2010, also faced hard difficulties. Debates mostly concerned coastal hazards mapping process, realized before the plans which strongly depend of them. A questionnaire survey of state services focuses on around sixty coastal hazards studies, concerning coastal flooding, coastline recession and sand dunes migration. The results define territories characteristics (current issues in territory and future territorial development), technical studies characteristics, project management and dialogue process between stakeholders. Chi-square tests of independence highlight major causes to encountered difficulties during dialogue process about coastal hazards mapping process. Current issues in territory don’t generate difficulties. However, territories {{with a high}} development and where prevention plans could bring constraints are places of conflicts about coastal hazards maps. Encountered difficulties during hazards mapping participatory process is also correlated to the complexity level of studie...|$|R
