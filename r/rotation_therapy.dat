30|$|We {{propose the}} {{establishment}} of a curriculum for the training of nuclear medicine specialists to become a certified nuclear oncologist. The training should include a program of 1  year with <b>rotations</b> into specialised <b>therapy</b> units, PET/CT-imaging and radiopharmacy as well as outpatient care in oncology, radiation oncology and palliative medicine. During this entire period, collaboration with other specialties in oncology and participation in interdisciplinary tumour boards at a comprehensive cancer centre will be required. Apart from Nuclear Medicine learning resources, specific chapters of a medical oncology textbook, such as Cancer by DeVita et al. [16], should be defined as learning books for the final board certification exam taken by the candidates. In our opinion, Nuclear Oncologists will be an elite force to further develop our specialty and to improve patient care at highly specialised centres.|$|R
40|$|Bilateral vestibulopathy (BV) is {{the loss}} of {{function}} of both peripheral labyrinths or of the eighth nerves. Its etiology remains obscure in approximately 20 % to 50 % of cases (so-called idiopathic bilateral vestibulopathy, IBV). Alternatively, the cause could be viral or vascular; to date, causative gene mutations have not been identified. Other potential disease mechanisms include autoimmune disorders. Antibodies have been detected against inner ear tissue (primarily against vestibular membranous labyrinth). The data suggest that the bulk of anti-labyrinthine autoantibodies may be an epiphenomenon, but a small subgroup of organ-specific autoantibodies may synergize with a cellular response to develop vestibular lesions. The two key symptoms of BV are the following: 1. unsteadiness of gait, particularly in the dark or on uneven ground, and 2. oscillopsia associated with head movements. Episodes of vertigo are reported by patients with IBV, particularly early in the development of vestibular loss. Associated hearing loss seldom occurs in the idiopathic type of this condition. Post-mortem examinations revealed a remarkably selective loss of vestibular hair cells in the vestibular end organs but normal hair cells in the cochlea. The diagnosis is made with a simple bedside test for defective vestibular function. The diagnosis can be confirmed by bithermal caloric testing and pendular body <b>rotation.</b> The <b>therapy</b> is based on steroid treatment, and the early initiation of immunosuppression appears to be essential for therapeutic success.

The 8th seed Magic would meet Hill's old team, the Detroit Pistons, in the first round. The Pistons' vast playoff experience would prevail over the inexperienced Magic, who had not seen significant post-season action for some years, and despite having some close games, the series would end with a 4-0 Pistons sweep, leaving Hill undecided on whether to return for the 2007-08 season with the Magic, sign with another team, or retire.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{radiation}} therapy techniques {{rely on a}} modulation of the fluence fields to optimize the clinical benefit of the treatment. This increased flexibility for intensity-modulated {{radiation therapy}} (IMRT) in comparison to conventional techniques allows the realization of excellent dose distributions. However, the advantage of superior dose distributions for IMRT usually requires an increased treatment time. A dose delivery technique {{with the potential to}} overcome this problem without impairing the treatment quality is dynamic <b>rotation</b> <b>therapy</b> in a single arc. This technique uses dynamic field shaping with a multileaf collimator (MLC) and a variable dose rate of the linac during irradiation to conform the dose distribution to the target volume. This thesis introduces an optimization concept for dynamic <b>rotation</b> <b>therapy</b> with variable dose rate, called arc-modulated cone beam therapy (AMCBT), that also accounts for all practical limitations of this approach imposed by the dose delivery hardware. This optimization algorithm is applied to assess the clinical potential of AMCBT via comparative treatment planning studies.

40|$|Many {{efforts have}} been made in the recent years to improve the {{prognosis}} of severe bacterial infections by reducing the risk of treating the patients inadequately. The reasons responsible for inadequate treatment have been intensively studied and antibiotic resistance has been identified as one of the main risks. Currently different strategies are considered to optimize antibiotic therapy, such as the adoption of local guidelines, de-escalation, <b>rotation</b> and association <b>therapies.</b> Each appears to prove efficacy in the containment of resistance and improvement of outcome; however, further studies, continuous monitoring of the epidemiology of severe infections and antibiotic resistance, and finally, availability of new drugs are needed. It is the authors' opinion that, despite the importance of guidelines for the optimal treatment and most appropriate management of severe infections, closer collaboration should be established between the medical staff in the wards and IDS, who can bridge the gap between the guidelines and the individual needs of the patient, thereby improving the decision-making process.

Relevant to Practice: The acquisition of nosocomial infections and the development of pressure sores continue to be major issues in the care of the critically ill, ventilated patient. The use of continuous lateral <b>rotation</b> <b>therapy</b> (CLRT) as an adjunct in the prevention and treatment of pneumonia has increased in popularity in recent years. A number of institutions routinely advocate the use of CLRT in critically ill patients. Conclusion: While there is some data to suggest that CLRT may have an impact on prevention of and treatment for nosocomial infections acquired by ventilated patients, there still remains insufficient evidence to its inclusion as a fully validated treatment. Clearly, there is a requirement for more robust, in-depth research into the efficacy of this proposed treatment. © 2011 The Authors.

40|$|Immobility {{is one of}} {{the factors}} {{associated}} with the accumulation of respiratory secretion in mechanically ventilated patients. Placing patients in a semi-recumbent position between 30 ° and 45 ° and frequent manual turning in every two hours are the standard ventilator nursing care practice adopted worldwide. However, the prevalence of pulmonary complications remains high. The use of continuous lateral <b>rotation</b> <b>therapy</b> (CLRT) to improve drainage of secretion within the lung and the lower airways was proposed and has been investigated in numerous studies. The purposes of this dissertation are (1) to perform a comprehensive systematic review for a critical appraisal of the current evidence on the use of CLRT to prevent pulmonary complications in mechanically ventilated patients, (2) to develop an evidence-based guideline and to assess the implementation potential, and (3) to develop an implementation and evaluation plan for translating the guideline to an adult intensive care unit (ICU) of a teaching hospital in Hong Kong. In order to identify studies that compared CLRT with the standard care, four electronic databases, including CINAHL Plus, Medline, British Nursing Index and PubMed, were searched. 94 studies were identified and eight of them met the inclusion criteria. These studies included one randomized controlled trial (RCT), two non-randomized controlled clinical trials, one pretest-posttest clinical trial and four retrospective cohort studies. The quality of these reviewed studies was assessed by using the appraisal instruments of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Four of the reviewed studies were graded as high quality. No major adverse patient outcome was reported. Instead, beneficial patient outcomes that reached statistical significance were consistently reported in the CLRT group. There were reductions in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atelectasis, duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay. However, its effect on health care cost and mortality was inconclusive. The implementation potential, in terms of the transferability, feasibility, and the cost-benefit ratio, was considered as high in the target setting. Based on the synthesized finding, a CLRT guideline is developed and is proposed to translate into practice. The implementation plan includes a communication plan with stakeholders and a pilot test. The guideline will be revised after the trial run of the proposed innovation for one and a half months. A full-scale controlled trial using a quasi-experimental design will be conducted. The primary outcome is to evaluate whether there is a reduction in the prevalence of VAP after the use of CLRT. According to previous studies, the use of CLRT can lead to a 49 % reduction in VAP. The proposed innovation will be considered as clinical effective when similar observation is obtained. published_or_final_versionNursing StudiesMasterMaster of Nursin...|$|E

40|$|Background: Shoulder pain is {{the second}} most common {{musculoskeletal}} disorder treated by physical therapists. The cause for the shoulder pain is multifactorial. However, a specific diagnosis is crucial in the right management of shoulder dysfunction. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} find out the efficacy of integrating the MRI for the accurate diagnosis and impact of this on rendering the effective physical therapy interventions in shoulder dysfunction patients. Methods: A retrospective study conducted on 14 patients who undergone an MRI with a 1. 5 T unit MAGNETOM Symphony (Siemens), for their shoulder pain, where the diagnosis might be Muscle tears like, subscapularis, infraspinatus,supraspinatus and teres minor muscles; subacromial or subdeltoid bursitis and labral tears were included. All the subjects were then continued with usual physical therapy treatments for four weeks depending on their diagnosis which includes; advice, stretching, mobilization and strengthening exercises, manual therapy, massage, strapping, and electrotherapy. The outcome measures documented from the case sheet were; Visual Analogue Scale grade and passive range of motion of shoulder external / internal rotation and abduction. Results: Paired t test was used to compare the PROM between pre rehabilitation and post rehabilitation testing and the non parametric test, Mann Whitney U test was used for the comparison of VAS. All patients showed a significant improvement in VAS and PROM of abduction, internal and external <b>rotation</b> following physical <b>therapy</b> (P≤ 0. 05).

40|$|Objective and methods: This health {{technology}} assessment (HTA) report synthesises systematically randomized controlled studies (RCT) on the therapy of moderate and severe psoriasis vulgaris which were published between 1999 and 2004; it includes some important clinical studies {{which have been}} published after 2004 and thus updates the English HTA report by Griffiths et al. [1]. The major objective is {{the evaluation of the}} medical effectiveness of different therapeutical approaches and the cost effectiveness with relevance for Germany. Results: The major conclusions from the results of medical RCT on moderate and severe psoriasis vulgaris are: Oral fumarates are effective in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris. However, fumarates quiet frequently cause moderate side effects. Cyclosporine and methotrexate are both effective in the treatment of severe psoriasis vulgaris. Both substances have a different spectrum of side effects which may limit the individual applicability. Acetritin is only moderately effective in the treatment of severe psoriasis of the plaque type. Calcipotriol or UV-radiation used at the same time can increase the clinical effectiveness of acetritin. Systemic PUVA, balneo-PUVA and UVB therapy are all effective for the treatment of severe psoriasis. The combination of UV therapy with vitamin D 3 analogues or with topical steroids is more effective than the treatment with UV radiation alone. Saltwater baths increase the effectiveness of UVB therapy. No RCT on the therapeutical effects of topical tar or of dithranol in combination with UV therapy have been published so far. A continuous therapy with PUVA should not be applied due to its proven photocarcinogenicity. Three substances from the group of biologicals (Efalizumab, Etanercept, and Infliximab) are now available in Europe and a further substance (Alefacept) is available in the USA for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. All biologicals have been effective in placebo controlled studies. The substances differ in the times until a clinical effect is observable, in the spectrum of side effects and in their efficiency on psoriasis arthritis. From health-economic studies considering both costs and clinical efficiency oral fumarates appear to be superior to acitretin or cyclosporine (although cyclosporine appears to be more effective in severe psoriasis). From the health economic view methotrexate is equivalent with UVB or PUVA and superior to cyclosporine. The therapy options UVB, UVB plus calcipotriol and PUVA are equivalent and superior to balneo-phototherapy. Biologicals are cost intensive and should be used when other approaches are not sufficient or are not applicable due to their side effects. The HTA report summarizes some health-economic studies on dithranol, on calcipotriol and on the combination with tar and UV light. No RCT have been published for the treatment of severe psoriasis with these agents alone but it appears to be certain that these substances are effective in severe psoriasis as well. DiscussionThe spectrum of therapeutical options has fortunately increased during the last years. It must be emphasized that a number of therapeutical procedures exist which are not discussed in detail in this HTA. This is due to the search strategy of literature: Only RCT performed with patients with moderate and/or severe psoriasis vulgaris were included into this evaluation. This led to the exclusion of a number of substances which are traditionally used alone or in combination for the treatment of moderate or severe psoriasis vulgaris (e. g. dithranol, salicyc acid, tar, corticosteroids and topical retinoids). Moreover, other approaches which include neither drugs nor UV light are not discussed in this HTA although the authors believe in the importance of psychotherapeutical interventions, educational approaches and combined medical and non-medical approaches in rehabilitational medicine in the management of psoriasis vulgaris. The transferability of the health economic evaluations is strongly limited by the fact that all included health economic evaluations except one were not aligned to a German setting. A future research question will be the evaluation of the duration of remission and relapse ratios in the context of different therapy options of moderate and severe psoriasis. Moreover, the consideration of combined outcomes such as the improvement of psoriatic symptoms and the decrease of symptoms in accompanying psoriasis arthritis represents a future requirement of health assessment. Conclusions: From the clinical point of view it is positive that the spectrum of therapeutic procedures for a chronic severe skin disease has increased continuously during the last years. In cases of individual contraindications or individual inefficacies it is now possible to try alternative approaches. Moreover the risk of long-term side effects can be reduced by changing the therapeutical procedure after some time (so-called <b>rotation</b> <b>therapy).</b> The therapeutical algorithm for severe psoriasis vulgaris now includes photo(chemo-) therapy in combination with topical substances, oral fumaric acid esters, retinoids (in combination with phototherapy or topical substances), methotrexate, cylosporine and the new biologics. Future studies should address therapeutical approaches which can not easily be studied by RCT, e. g. physical, balneological, climate approaches, educational programs and complex rehabilitation therapy which all may have positive effects on individuals with severe psoriasis. As in medical therapy management of moderate and severe psoriasis the economic evaluation also points out the way of a strategic therapy concept which corresponds to a large extent to the algorithm in medical practice...|$|E

We evaluated the effect of an antibiotic rotation programme on the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. We conducted a 2 -year before-and-after study at two medical-surgical ICUs at two different tertiary referral hospitals. We included all mechanically ventilated patients admitted for ≥ 48  h who developed VAP. From 1 January through 31 December 2007, a quarterly rotation of antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems and cefepime/ceftazidime) for the empirical treatment of VAP was implemented. We analysed the incidence of VAP and the antibiotic resistance patterns of the responsible pathogens in 2006, before (P 1) and, in 2007, after (P 2) the introduction of the scheduled rotation programme. Overall, there were 79 VAP episodes in P 1 and 44 in P 2; the mean incidence of VAP was 20. 96 cases per 1, 000  days of mechanical ventilation (MV) during P 1 and 14. 97 in P 2, with no significant difference between periods on segmented regression analysis. We observed a non-significant reduction of the number of both the poly-microbial (14 [17. 7 %] in P 1 and 5 [10. 6 %] in P 2 [[*]=[*] 0. 32]) and of the antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria-related VAP (42 [45. 2 %] in P 1 and 16 [34 %] in P 2 [[*]=[*] 0. 21]). Conversely, the number of VAP caused by passed from 8. 35 per 1, 000  days of MV in P 1 to 2. 33 per 1, 000  days of MV in P 2 ([*]=[*] 0. 02). No difference in ICU mortality and crude in-hospital mortality between P 1 and P 2 was noted. Moreover, no significant change of microbial flora isolated through clinical cultures was observed. We were able to conclude that, despite global microbial flora not being affected by such a programme, antibiotic <b>therapy</b> <b>rotation</b> may reduce the incidence of VAP caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in the ICU, such as.
