The Southern Railway retained a <b>route-based</b> headcode system, with up to four lamps in six positions. Notable exceptions were former Glasgow and South Western Railway and the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway lines, which continued with their own headcodes on internal trains.

A validation strategy that uses clustering techniques to create clusters of forecast points with similar geographical and infrastructure characteristics is presented, as well as two methodologies for de-parameterising key geographical and infrastructure parameters in the ENTICE <b>route-based</b> model that are currently not measured at the spatial scale demanded by a <b>route-based</b> forecast. The proposed validation strategy facilitates the analysis of forecast statistics at the cluster level, which is shown to provide a more representative measure of the model’s spatial forecasting ability. The majority of thermal variations around the study route are well represented by the clustering solutions, presenting the opportunity for new sampling strategies with the potential to validate forecasts at a vastly improved spatial and temporal resolution. De-parameterisation of the road construction and surface roughness parameters within the ENTICE model using Ground Penetrating Radar and airborne LIDAR data has been shown to significantly improve the spatial forecasting ability of ENTICE, with the model changes leading to refinement of the clustering solution which enables it to better capture the physical relationship between road surface temperature and the geographical and infrastructure parameters around the study route.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} empirical {{analyses of}} two Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) formulations of FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) detailed routing constraints. Boolean SAT-based routing transforms a routing problem into a Boolean SAT instance by rendering geometric routing constraints as an atomic Boolean function. The generated Boolean function is satisfiable if {{and only if}} the corresponding routing is possible. Two different Boolean SAT-based routing models are analyzed: the track-based and the <b>route-based</b> routing constraint model. The track-based routing model transforms a routing task into a net-to-track assignment problem, whereas the <b>route-based</b> routing model reduces it into a routability-checking problem with explicitly enumerated set of detailed routes for nets. In both models, routing constraints are represented as CNF Boolean Satisfiability clauses. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrate that the <b>route-based</b> formulation yields an easier-to-evaluate and more scalable routability Boolean function than the track-based method. This is empirical evidence that a smart/efficient Boolean formulation can achieve significant performance improvement in real-world applications.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cognitive maps {{have been}} used to explain the {{cognitive}} processes underlying human spatial memory for several decades. Numerous theories have offered explanations regarding the structure of cognitive maps from the perspectives of spatial cognition, visual perception, and neuroscience. Within this literature, two representations of cognitive maps (map-like representations and <b>route-based</b> representations) have generally been used to model the learning of spatial information. Map-like representations involve spatial geometries, with landmarks acting as strong references. Alternatively, <b>route-based</b> representations consist of sequences of positions, orientations, and landmarks. Studies suggest that humans use both of these representations, and that the representation (and thus the strategy) used is often a function of the agent’s familiarity with the environment. In this paper, we propose an ACT-R model that integrates both these representations and their associated strategies, using a <b>route-based</b> representation when learning new environments and a map-based representation to refine the agent’s understanding. The results show that the map-based representation could improve an agent’s route-following abilities in at least two cases: (1) searching the route when the agent is in an off-route position, and (2) for taking novel shortcuts in the route.

40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} {{visualize}} acoustic comfort along tourist routes. <b>Route-based</b> tourism {{is crucial to}} the sustainability of tourism development in historic areas. Applying the concept of <b>route-based</b> tourism to guide tourists rambling along cultural and heritage routes can relieve overcrowded condition at hot scenic spots and increase the overall carrying capacity of the city. However, acoustic comfort along tourist routes is rarely addressed in academic studies and decision-making. Taking Macao as an example, this paper has studied pedestrian exposure to traffic noise along the cultural and heritage routes. The study is based on a GIS-based traffic noise model system with a high spatial resolution down to individual buildings along both sides of the street. Results show that tourists suffer from excessive traffic noise at certain sites, which may have negative impact on the promotion of <b>route-based</b> tourism in the long run. In addition, it is found that urban growth affects urban form and street layout, which in turn affect traffic flow and acoustic comfort in urban area. The present study demonstrates spatial techniques to visualize acoustic comfort along tourist routes, and the techniques are foreseen to be used more frequently to support effective tourism planning in the future...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{ability to}} {{navigate}} {{in a familiar}} environment mainly relies on route knowledge, that is, a mental representation of relevant locations along a way, sequenced according to a navigational goal. Despite the clear ecological validity of this issue, route navigation and route knowledge have been scarcely investigated and {{little is known about}} the neural and cognitive bases of this navigational strategy. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we tested the validity of the predictions based on the main cognitive models of spatial knowledge acquisition about <b>route-based</b> navigation. Methods: An order judgment task was used with two conditions (route and activity). Subjects were required to detect potential mismatches between a current sensory input and expectations deriving from route and activity knowledge. Results: A medial occipto-temporal (e. g., lingual gyms, calcarine cortex, fusiform gyms, parahippocampal cortex) network was found activated during the route task, whereas a temporo-parietal (temporo-parietal junction) and frontal (e. g., Broca's area) network was related to the activity task. Conclusions: Functional data are congruent with cognitive models of <b>route-based</b> navigation. The route task activated areas related to both landmark identity and landmark order. Data are discussed in view of <b>route-based</b> navigation models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

This study {{assessed}} the environmental characteristics of ten universities, comparing {{the extent to}} which physical infra-structures are able to support a <b>route-based</b> walking intervention. Method. Following protocol standardization between and within sites, major pedestrian routes at main suburban campuses in seven countries (Australia, Canada, England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Spain and the United States) were audited by researchers using an established inventory (March–June 2008). The inventory assessed key characteristics (e. g. size and employee number) and nine specific items (pedestrian facilities, vehicle conflicts, crossings, route-maintenance, walkway width, roadway buffer, universal accessibility, aesthetics and cover), scored on a five-point scale (1 =very poor; 5 =excellent). Item scores for each route, were combined and weighted, to provide indicators of low (score of 20 – 39), fair (score of 40 – 69), or good (score of 70 – 100) physical infra-structure support. Results. Sites varied in area (range of 7 – 1000 acres) and employee numbers (range of 700 – 7500 employees).

40|$|The plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV) is a promising option for future sustainable transportation. It offers better fuel economy and lower emissions than conventional vehicles. This thesis has developed a novel energy-optimal powertrain controller for PHEVs. The controller will be broadly applicable to all PHEV models; however, it will be fine-tuned to the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid for testing and validation. The controller will take advantage of advancements in vehicle intelligent and communications technologies, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), Geographic Information System (GIS), radar, and other on-board sensors, to provide look-ahead trip data. These data are critical to increasing fuel economy as well as driving safety. This PhD research has developed three energy-optimal systems for PHEVs: Trip Planning module, <b>Route-based</b> Energy Management System (<b>Route-based</b> EMS), and Ecological Cruise (Eco-Cruise) Controller. The main objective of these energy-optimal systems is to minimize the total energy cost, including both electricity derived from the grid and fuel. The upper-level system is Trip Planning, using an algorithm designed to take advantage of previewed trip information to optimize State of Charge (SOC) profiles. The <b>Route-based</b> EMS optimally distributes propulsion power between the batteries and engine. Finally, the Eco-Cruise controller adjusts the speed considering upcoming trip data. Real-time implementation has remained a major challenge in the design of complex control systems. To address this hurdle, simple and efficient models and fast optimization algorithms are developed for each energy-optimal strategy. A Real-time Cluster-based Optimization is developed to solve the Trip Planning problem in real-time. The <b>Route-based</b> EMS is developed based on Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) to optimally distribute propulsion power between two energy sources. And, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is utilized to obtain optimum traction or regenerative torques in Eco-Cruise controller. Model-in-the-Loop (MIL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing are critical steps in control validation and in ensuring real-time implementation capability. The MIL results show that the novel energy-optimal powertrain controller can improve the total energy cost by up to % 20 compare to benchmark rule-based controller. The HIL test results demonstrate that the computational time for energy-optimal strategies are less than the target sampling-time, and they can be implemented in real-time...|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{a problem}} in {{computer}} network security, wherein packet filters are deployed to defend a network against spoofed denial of service attacks. Information on the Internet is transmitted by the exchange of IP packets, which must declare their origin and destination addresses. A <b>route-based</b> packet filter verifies whether the purported origin of a packet is correct {{with respect to the}} current route map. We examine the optimization problem of finding a minimum cardinality set of nodes to filter in the network such that no spoofed packet can reach its destination.

We identify topologies and routing policies for which a polynomial-time solution to the minimum filter placement problem exists, and prove that under certain routing conditions a greedy heuristic for the filter placement problem yields an optimal solution.

Compared {{to the majority of}} relevant models formulated in the route domain, the link-based modeling has two desirable features on modeling flexibility and algorithmic development. First, it avoids the normal route travel time distribution assumption (uniformly imposed for all routes) that inherits from the Central Limit Theorem in most <b>route-based</b> models, permitting the use of any suitable link travel time distributions from empirical studies. Second, the additive route cost structure makes the L-METE model solvable by readily adapting existing UE algorithms without the need of storing/enumerating routes while avoiding the computationally demanding nonadditive shortest path problem and route flow allocations in <b>route-based</b> models, which is a significant benefit for large-scale network applications under uncertainty.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a problem of}} placing <b>route-based</b> filters in a communication network {{to limit the number}} of forged address attacks to a prescribed level. Nodes in the network communicate by exchanging packets along arcs, and the originating node embeds the origin and destination addresses within each packet that it sends. In the absence of a validation mechanism, one node can send packets to another node using a forged origin address to launch an attack against that node. <b>Route-based</b> filters can be established at various nodes on the communication network to protect against these attacks. A <b>route-based</b> filter examines each packet arriving at a node, and determines whether or not the origin address could be legitimate, based on the arc on which the packet arrives, the routing information, and possibly the destination. The problem we consider seeks to find a minimum cardinality subset of nodes to filter so that the prescribed level of security is achieved. The primary contributions of this dissertation are as follows. We formulate and discuss the modeling of this filter placement problem as a mixed-integer program. We then show the sensitivity of the optimal number of deployed filters as the required level of security changes, and demonstrate that current vertex cover-based heuristics are ineffective for problems with relaxed security levels. We identify a set of special network topologies on which the filter placement problem is solvable in polynomial time, focusing our attention on the development of a dynamic programming algorithm for solving this problem on tree networks. These results can then in turn be used to derive valid inequalities for an integer programming model of the filter placement problem. Finally, we present heuristic algorithms based on the insights gained from our overall study for solving the problem, and evaluate their performance against the optimal solution provided by our integer programming model...|$|E
