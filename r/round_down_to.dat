5|$|In 2012, the NHC {{expanded}} the windspeed range for Category 4 by 1mph in both directions, to 130–156mph, with corresponding {{changes in the}} other units (113–136 kn, 209–251km/h), instead of 131–155mph (114–135 kn, 210–249km/h). The NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments, and then convert to mph and km/h with a similar rounding for other reports. So an intensity of 115 knots is rated Category 4, but the conversion to miles per hour (132.3mph) would <b>round</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 130mph, making it {{appear to be a}} Category 3 storm. Likewise, an intensity of 135 knots (~155mph, and thus Category 4) is 250.02km/h, which according to the definition used before the change would be Category 5. To resolve these issues, the NHC had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135mph, and 135 kn as 245km/h. The change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130mph, and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250km/h, and still qualify as Category 4. Since the NHC had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in Category 4 in each unit of measure, the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years. The new scale became operational on May 15, 2012.|$|E

[...] It is very likely that the Republican casualties were 50% higher, about 84,750. [...] The Republicans lost {{a large number of}} prisoners.

5000|$|The current coins were {{introduced}} in 1991 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 céntimos and 1 sol. The 2- and 5-sol coins were added in 1994. Although one- and five-céntimo coins are officially in circulation, they are very rarely used. For this reason, the aluminium one-céntimo coin introduced in December, 2005, was removed from circulation on May 1, 2011. For cash transactions, retailers must <b>round</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the nearest ten céntimos or up to the nearest five. Electronic transactions will still be processed in the exact amount. An aluminium five-céntimo coin was introduced in 2007. [...] All coins show the coat of arms of Peru surrounded by the text Banco Central de Reserva del Perú ("Central Reserve Bank of Peru") on the obverse; the reverse of each coin shows its denomination.

50|$|Only {{a handful}} of these submachineguns had been ordered for trial purposes, when in July 1928 the Soviet Army {{leadership}} decided that a single new automatic cartridge should be developed for both automatic pistols and submachine guns, to be obtained by modifying the 7.63×25mm Mauser <b>round</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet machinery standard of 7.62 mm. Tokarev had to adapt his design to this new ammunition. By then, the competition had been joined by designs from Degtyarev and Korovin, who designed their weapons directly for the new round. Trials were conducted in July 1930, pitted Tokarev models chambered for both rounds against these other two domestic competitors. The Army commission was rather dissatisfied with all guns presented at this trial. Eventually, in Feb 1931, the army ordered 500 Tokarevs chambered in the revolver round, {{to be sent to}} the troops for more extensive trials. The feedback received from the troops was apparently negative. The number of Tokarev submachineguns (chambered in the Nagant round) actually produced and delivered remains uncertain.|$|E

The left arm was close to the body with the forearm flexed at a right angle and lying across the abdomen. The right arm was slightly abducted from the body and rested on the mattress. The elbow was bent, the forearm supine with the fingers clenched. The legs were wide apart, the left thigh at right angles to the trunk and the right forming an obtuse angle with the pubis.The whole of the surface of the abdomen and thighs was removed and the abdominal cavity emptied of its viscera. The breasts were cut off, the arms mutilated by several jagged wounds and the face hacked beyond recognition of the features. The tissues of the neck were severed all <b>round</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the bone.The viscera were found in various parts viz: the uterus and kidneys with one breast under the head, the other breast by the right foot, the liver between the feet, the intestines by the right side and the spleen by the left side of the body. The flaps removed from the abdomen and thighs were on a table.The bed clothing at the right corner was saturated with blood, and on the floor beneath was a pool of blood covering about two feet square. The wall by the right side of the bed and in a line with the neck was marked by blood which had struck it in several places.The face was gashed in all directions, the nose, cheeks, eyebrows, and ears being partly removed. The lips were blanched and cut by several incisions running obliquely down to the chin. There were also numerous cuts extending irregularly across all the features.The neck was cut through the skin and other tissues right down to the vertebrae, the fifth and sixth being deeply notched. The skin cuts in the front of the neck showed distinct ecchymosis. The air passage was cut at the lower part of the larynx through the cricoid cartilage.Both breasts were more or less removed by circular incisions, the muscle down to the ribs being attached to the breasts. The intercostals between the fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs were cut through and the contents of the thorax visible through the openings.The skin and tissues of the abdomen from the costal arch to the pubes were removed in three large flaps. The right thigh was denuded in front to the bone, the flap of skin, including the external organs of generation, and part of the right buttock. The left thigh was stripped of skin fascia, and muscles as far as the knee.The left calf showed a long gash through skin and tissues to the deep muscles and reaching from the knee to five inches above the ankle. Both arms and forearms had extensive jagged wounds.The right thumb showed a small superficial incision about one inch long, with extravasation of blood in the skin, and there were several abrasions on the back of the hand moreover showing the same condition.On opening the thorax it was found that the right lung was minimally adherent by old firm adhesions. The lower part of the lung was broken and torn away. The left lung was intact. It was adherent at the apex and there were a few adhesions over the side. In the substances of the lung there were several nodules of consolidation.The pericardium was open below and the heart absent. In the abdominal cavity there was some partly digested food of fish and potatoes, and similar food was found in the remains of the stomach attached to the intestines.|$|E
