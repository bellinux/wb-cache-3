50|$|The former customhouse in Wiscasset stands {{adjacent}} to its historic waterfront area, at {{the northwest corner}} of Water and Fore Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a hip roof and granite foundation. Its south-facing front facade is three bays wide, the center one projecting slightly and topped by a low-pitch gable with a keystoned half-round window at its center. A porch shelters the center entrance, with square paneled posts rising by an entablature and flat roof with balcony <b>rail.</b> <b>Windows</b> on the ground floor consist of pairs set in segmented-arch openings, while those on the second floor, also paired, are set in round-arch openings. A granite entablature separates the brick wall from the projecting roof cornice.|$|E
50|$|The powder {{magazine}} {{stands on}} concrete foundations and is sheltered by a hipped roof clad with early short sheets of corrugated iron sheets. The {{roof of the}} building's eastern end, including the memorial hall extension, is largely clad in recent metal sheeting. Constructed of cavity brick walls 14 inches (355.6mm) thick, the former magazine measures 30 x 20 feet (9.1m x 6.1m) internally with a floor to ceiling height of 10 feet 3 inches (3124.2mm). The three narrow rectangular openings to each long side each measure 42 inches x 18 inches (1066.8mm x 457.2mm) and house solid timber plank and <b>rail</b> <b>windows.</b> The building has a polished timber floor and a coved ceiling lined with painted, beaded tongue and groove timber boards and accommodates a decorative ceiling rose. An opening in the west wall accommodates an escape door. The exterior south and west walls have a cement slurry finish; the north exterior and the interior walls are painted.The stage {{end of the hall}} extends from the line of the demolished exterior east wall of the powder magazine. The original door housed to the centre of this wall now hangs to the opening in the north wall at the stage end. The kitchen wing extension runs along the north side. The hall extensions are timber framed, clad with narrow chamferboards and fibre cement sheeting and are lined with fibre cement sheeting. This part of the building has a flat ceiling lined with similar sheeting, which extends over part of the magazine.|$|E

This also happened to engravings in early Croatian script - Glagolitic. Soon, the Glagolitic writings were replaced with Latin on altar rails and architraves of old-Croatian churches.|$|R

A new organ by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd was installed in 1875.|$|R
5000|$|At the 1950 Earls Court Show Burlingham had two {{new coach}} designs on Royal Tiger and AEC Regal IV chassis, both shown with a luxury 37-seat seating plan in their central-entrance bodies, when 39 or 41 {{would have been}} the more likely choice of all but the most-upmarket customers. The designs were related, having similar {{detailing}} and windscreens, and an identical cast chromium-plated frontal motif, but the AEC had traditional teardrop-shape wheel-arch mouldings and a straight waist <b>rail</b> with vertical <b>window</b> pillars, whilst the Leyland [...] had a curved waist <b>rail,</b> <b>window</b> pillars angled back from the vertical and an ellipsoid moulding sweeping from the front {{to the rear of the}} coach; this feature was known internally as the 'tank panel' because of its resemblance in shape to a World War One tank. This second coach was finished in the livery of its customer Woods of Blackpool, who traded as Seagull Coaches. Show visitors asked Burlingham for the style with the seagull on the side, and this (despite some chagrin at Woods) soon evolved into the marque name for the style. The previous body was still available for vertical-engined heavyweights but also to the new 30 ft length, and only in full-front form, with the tank-panel and front chrome motif as options. 1951 would be last season of a style with its origins in the late 1930s. For the Seagull, though, it was the start of a prosperous decade. In 1994 it came second in the Classic Bus reader poll to find the most attractive coach body style of all time. It was by far the most successful type of coach body for the early underfloor-engined chassis, selling well on Royal Tiger, Regal IV and Daimler Freeline chassis, Daimler choosing the Seagull style for LKV218, its coach demonstrator. Two were also fitted to Foden rear-engined coaches. From 1952 variants were introduced for vertical-engined chassis, starting with a style for the initial Bedford SB, a 35-seat version with a lengthened rear overhang. Shortly afterwards Scottish Omnibuses (as SMT had become) requested a version to fit Bedford OB chassis converted to forward control; these were known as 'baby Seagulls' and went to SOL and its Highland Omnibuses subsidiary. SOL also took Seagulls to rebody formerly half-cab AEC Regal IIIs. Others who ordered very large numbers of the style were Ribble and many other BET group members and independent coach operators, the largest customer from that sector being Wallace Arnold.|$|R

5000|$|Karmann {{showed a}} more luxurious {{prototype}} {{based on the}} Tourist, called simply the [...] "Tourist L". It had a glass sunroof, roof <b>rails,</b> tinted <b>windows,</b> and an upgraded interior. Irmscher developed a modernized, sportier-looking version with 14-inch alloy wheels called the 1.3 New Line. Wartburg could see {{the writing on the}} wall, however, and only two New Lines were built. A Wartburg 1.4 was also developed in 1990, with a Renault engine. This was in an attempt to lower costs (which were rising rapidly after the reunification) by thirty per cent, and the Barkas-built drivetrain was the most expensive part. One operational prototype was built, but it was decided to liquidate Automobilwerk Eisenach rather than continuing production. A joint venture with Opel was chosen, and in the Wartburg plant was replaced by one building the Opel Vectra.|$|R
50|$|The Grand Canyon Power Plant is a {{concrete}} framed industrial building sheathed in a rustic exterior {{reminiscent of a}} huge Swiss chalet. Despite its bulk, {{the design of the}} plant carefully minimizes its apparent bulk and integrates it with the natural landscape.

50|$|Inside {{the church}} the five-bay arcades are carried on {{octagonal}} piers with capitals deeply carved with foliage. There are also arcades between the chancel and the chapels. The south aisle contains confessionals. There are marble altars in the chancel and the chapels, {{each with a}} reredos. The reredos in the chancel was designed by Pugin in 1867; it is in richly carved alabaster, and contains statues in niches. In each chapel are three statues in canopied niches. Stretching across the whole church is a continuous marble altar <b>rail.</b> The east <b>window</b> contains stained glass dating from 1925.|$|R
5000|$|The fifteenth-century tower, having proved unstable, was {{demolished}} in 1704 {{by order}} of the Archbishop. A 130-foot high replacement was completed in 1721. In contrast to {{the main body of}} the church, it was built in a Gothic style, in imitation of that of Magdalen College, Oxford. [...] Construction had begun in 1715, with money from the coal fund. The designer of the lower stages was probably William Dickinson, working in Christopher Wren's office. Funds proved inadequate, and work stopped in 1717 with the tower half completed. The tower was eventually completed in 1722 with the aid of a grant from the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, the upper stages being to the designs of its surveyor, Nicholas Hawksmoor. Containing elaborately panelled turrets, Hawksmoor's tower contains King's Chapel terminations in the pinnacles. Repairs were made in 1751, 1775, and 1790, the last two of which were done under the survey of George Wyatt. In the 1790 repairs, the south aisle windows and the east window were made circular, as well as the addition of a new pulpit, desk, altar <b>rail,</b> east <b>window</b> glass, and 12 new brass branches.|$|R
5000|$|The church’s {{interior}} {{features an}} oak carved altar, lectern, pulpit, rood screen and altar <b>rail.</b> Stained glass <b>windows</b> line {{the east and}} west walls.

In 1985 a pipe organ, which had been built for a church in Bloomer, Wisconsin in 1930, was purchased a rebuilt in the church. It contains 1,126 pipes. [...] A new oak altar was built in 1993 so the priest can face the congregation during the service. It was consecrated on March 29, 1994. The original church was remodeled again in 2001 to create a new fellowship hall. While it was air-conditioned at the time the rest of the church building was air-conditioned in 2004.|$|R
50|$|Max Frelander the architect, {{who worked}} as an {{assistant}} to Sonck, has contributed to the interior design. A rich Jugend ornamentation decorates both the interior, the staircases and the windows. The altar, the pulpit, the altar <b>rail,</b> and the <b>window</b> frame are all made of Finnish soapstone. The central motif of the altar is a cross, on which base there is a symmetrical carving of two serpents. Also on the corner level of the altar rail there are rings of twisting serpents. The top of the cross is ornamented with a dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit. The Jugend windows of the choir, which depict Finnish pine, were destroyed in a bombing raid during the Finnish Winter War (1939-1940). The national romantic movement is particularly dominant {{in the design of the}} choir. Motifs from Finnish nature are associated with traditional Christian symbolism.|$|R

A. mainly focused on the acoustics of power windows. The project included tests on closing-opening event sequences of the power <b>window</b> <b>rail,</b> to evaluate the component noise. Different trials were performed varying the test conditions. Time-frequency analyses, psychoacoustic metrics and models were applied to the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) time functions of the raw microphone signals and compared with threshold values from the literature. Scalar parameters quantifying the electric motor steadiness were also computed to characterize the noise excitation source while accelerometer signals were analysed in the frequency domain to extract modal parameters. The SPL time function appeared highly related to supply voltage, motor type and silent block insertion whereas psychoacoustic parameters were able to highlight further peculiarities of sound timbre...|$|R
50|$|For the Phantom school bus, {{the sides}} of the body saw a number of design changes. As it was to be used for school routes and not for transit use, the rear {{curbside}} exit was deleted; it was also a design change forced by regulations. In its place, an emergency-exit door was added to {{the left side of the}} bus (as required by design standards for rear-engine buses). As the Phantom school bus could not use transit-style windows, narrower split-sash windows (added to the Transit Coach during 1980 production) were fitted. On Phantoms outside of California, a stop arm was fitted to the left side of the body (the device was not required on new school buses in California until the end of the 1980s). To reinforce the body structure, Gillig added two full-length steel <b>rails</b> below the <b>window</b> line; unlike most school buses, the structure of the Phantom was additionally reinforced above the window line as well.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the initial}} {{development}} of infrastructure and some homes, project stalled after {{the outbreak of}} the Mexican Revolution in 1910. After the war was over, Roma, along with sister colonias of Colonia Juárez, Colonia Condesa, Colonia San Rafael, Colonia Santa María la Ribera and others, experienced a building boom in the 1920s and 1930s. The architecture in all of these areas at this time rejected Mexico’s traditional Baroque architecture of red tezontle stone and wrought iron balconies and <b>window</b> <b>rails</b> for a more modern look, heavily influenced by European trends, especially French, and eventually Art Deco. The colonia was at its most exclusive, considered aristocratic and [...] "European," [...] from its beginning {{to the end of the}} 1930s, with its historically and architecturally significant buildings constructed between 1906 and 1939. It not only attracted wealthy Mexican families, but also a number of foreign residents the initial British and American developers to a number of French and Spanish. By the 1930s, the colonia has a number of clubs or meeting houses such as La Bandida, where many politicians in Manuel Ávila Camacho’s government would meet, and erotic bathhouses such as La Torre. Although two significant churches were built between 1900 and 1940, the Cristero War in the 1930s and its related religious persecutions, resulted in their closing, with services held clandestinely in private homes.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} St. Basil’s Church was small, {{more accurately}} described as “very lofty, very short and definitely unfinished”. At its consecration the Church was 100’ {{in length and}} 50’ in width, with stone foundation walls some 30” thick tapering to 13” above which were double brick walls with small buttresses topped by a gabled roof with dormers. The initial brick work was done in Flemish bond style, the later brick work in English bond style. The ceiling was of open timber construction, the great oak beams visibly supporting the roof. A small sanctuary was formed by a semi-circular apse extending out from the north wall. It contained an altar and several choir stalls enclosed by a semi-circular communion <b>rail.</b> Three glass <b>windows</b> behind the main altar and the two side altars were covered with some colored material, probably red bunting. There were two side aisles but no centre aisle. Seating was provided by rough wood benches. The Stations of the Cross were simple etchings. The church had a small manual organ, purchased for $800.00. At the rear (south) end of the nave a wooden partition extending from the side walls separated the nave from small vestibule area that contained two confessionals, {{one on each side}} wall. The entrance from the south façade consisted of a high wooden platform reached by two steep flights of stairs from both the east and west sides down to ground level. There was no choir loft or steeple.|$|R

[...] The facade has 5 openings on each story. [...] The center opening is an entrance to the first story and the basement. [...] The main entrance consists of separate doors. The interior of the tavern is very distinctive as well with windows located on the first and second stories with 6 over 6 sash and wide frames. The East and West gables have two windows at each level and the cornice of the low pitched roof continues on all sides, which create pent eaves on the gables. The main floor has two parlors, one for the public and the other was a small office. [...] The front parlor contains original 18th century paneling. The second floor has 5 chambers that were used mainly by its guests. Each room contains a corner fireplace. The southeast parlor is an original room, which contains raised panel chimney breast, bold cornice, 3 piece chair <b>rail</b> and original <b>windows</b> and door trim. [...] This was the most elaborate design for all the rooms and tradition says that George Washington stayed in the northeast bedroom. [...] In the 1880s, the house was divided into an east wing and a west wing with the original staircase being replaced by two steep enclosed stairs. The attic served as quarters for the guests’ servants, but was roughly finished.|$|R
5000|$|The palace {{was built}} between the 1892 and 1895, {{by the project}} of Serbian {{architect}} Vladimir Nikolić, where once the [...] "Pasha9s Konak" [...] was located. [...] "Pasha's Konak" [...] was the first residence {{of the head of}} the Serbian Church after transferring from the Archbishopric of Peć to Sremski Karlovci. Metropolitan Stefan Stratimirović established a fund in 1817 to raise funds for the construction of the palace, which was built during the reign of Metropolitan Georgije II Branković. Construction of the palace in the style of Italian palaces was entrusted to contractors Peklo Bela and Karlo Lerer. Royal Chapel was painted by Uroš Predić. The basis of the palace {{is in the form of}} the Cyrillic letter S, with the porte-cochère in the middle. Above the entrance, there is the royal chapel, which was covered with a hemisphere dome with lantern on top. The main facade has a forward side with Rizal emphasized in the level of the first-floor columns, pilasters, which is the amount of Attica architraves triangular ends, and central Rizal is highlighted with three windows that are bigger than others, a terrace and front entrance where the stairs to the side of stone sculptures set of two lions.

The Patriarchy Cour is not only the administrative seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church, but also treasures which are stored valuables, works of art, icons, portraits of the major metropolitan and church dignitaries, different objects of applied arts and library of rare and valuable manuscripts and old printed books. Within the palace, a treasury is open to the public with a permanent display of objects from the eighteenth and nineteenth century from the destroyed churches in Bosnia and Croatia. The complex is surrounded by a high fence, combining bricks and cast iron.Today, the building is a permanent residence of the Bishop of Srem and a summer residence of Serbian Patriarch and also a home to the Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The building and the park is immaculately maintained. Palace is a monument of exceptional importance, and on the list of the Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance.|$|R
