2500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the congestion charge around 3000 vehicles used the road on a daily basis. The narrow street, built centuries ago to cater for nothing bigger than a horse and cart, is used by up to 17,000 pedestrians a day, and, according to Durham County Council a [...] "conflict between the two was causing traffic congestion, environmental problems and road safety hazards, as well as detracting from the experience of the World Heritage Site". A year after the charge had been introduced, figures showed vehicle activity using the road fell by 85%. Until 2011, traffic was controlled by a <b>rising</b> <b>bollard</b> in the road, which was monitored by CCTV and linked to an intercom system.|$|E
50|$|The Turl {{has been}} closed to traffic (except for access) since 1985. A <b>rising</b> <b>bollard,</b> {{installed}} by the Oxford City Council, cuts it off in the middle.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A <b>rising</b> <b>bollard</b> {{road block}} between Hanwell Fields and Hardwick in 2010. They are locally called Hanwell Fields 'check points', because {{they look like}} (less a guard) Western European checkpoints.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Rising</b> <b>bollards</b> can be {{retracted}} {{into the}} roadway to allow traffic to pass, or deployed to stop it.|$|R
50|$|Since 2003, {{access to}} motor {{vehicles}} without an appropriate transponder has been controlled by <b>rising</b> <b>bollards.</b> It allows eastward traffic flow from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and westward flow from 4 p.m. to 12 midnight, daily.|$|R
5000|$|Retractable or [...] "rising" [...] {{bollards}} can {{be lowered}} entirely below the road surface (generally using an electric or hydraulic mechanism) to enable traffic to pass, or raised to block traffic. <b>Rising</b> <b>bollards</b> {{are used to}} secure sensitive areas from attack, or to enforce traffic rules that are time related, or to restrict access to particular classes of traffic.|$|R

5000|$|A sump buster is {{a device}} {{installed}} within a bus route to limit that thoroughfare to buses. It discourages traffic from entering a lane by promising {{to destroy the}} oil pan of any vehicle with insufficient ground clearance to get over it, making them similar in use (but not design) to <b>rising</b> <b>bollards.</b> A sump buster can also {{be known as a}} [...] "sump breaker" [...] or [...] "sump trap".|$|R
50|$|Access to {{the estate}} for {{vehicles}} is restricted to three entrances - North Road (off Derby Road), Lenton Road (next to castle) and Peveril Drive (off Castle Boulevard) where a key card is required to operate the <b>rising</b> <b>bollards.</b> There are also two minor entrances - Barrack Lane (off Derby Road) and Newcastle Drive/Park Row (off The Ropewalk)- that provide access to selected parts of the estate (with a somewhat circuitous route {{to the rest of}} the estate), although Barrack Lane itself does not fall within The Park.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rising</b> <b>bollards</b> are {{increasingly}} common {{around the world}} to hinder vehicle-based terrorist actions from achieving close proximity to buildings, and are also used to prevent terrorist vehicle-ramming attacks such as the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack. They are also useful in mixed-use public spaces, which support both pedestrian use and emergency or service vehicle use. These bollards are usually priced between $11,000 to $100,000 depending on their ability to resist ramming vehicles, based on speed. The most expensive bollards can stop vehicles at speeds of about 50 mph.|$|R
2500|$|After the 1996 bomb it {{was decided}} to limit traffic allowed onto Corporation between Withy Grove and Cross Street. The IRA had reverted to using vehicle bombs, as {{evidenced}} in the Manchester bombing and other attacks such as the 1988 Armagh bomb, and so crowded areas on major streets represented a risk to pedestrians. Vehicular access to the area is limited by <b>rising</b> <b>bollards.</b> A credit-card sized key is attached to the windscreen of authenticated emergency vehicles and buses, which is automatically scanned. The bollard [...] lowers, accompanied by a sound to warn pedestrians, and allows the vehicle to pass.|$|R
5000|$|Re-introduction of manned checkpoints, {{restricted}} roads, {{as well as}} <b>rising</b> street <b>bollards</b> and crash-proof barricades were {{proposed in}} December 2016 to combat [...] "hostile vehicle-borne security threats". The proposals {{will be subject to}} a consultation and, if approved, be fully implemented by 2022.|$|R
25|$|The {{bollards}} surrounding Corporation Street {{have gained}} notoriety {{in the media}} and online with CCTV footage of cars colliding with them. They also have a reputation for being unreliable: a special fire engine became lodged on a <b>rising</b> pair of <b>bollards</b> in 2008. In March 2009, a Metroshuttle bus collided with the retractable bollards and three people had to be taken to hospital with minor injuries, and in April 2009, footage was captured showing an ambulance doing a U-turn to find an alternative route after the retractable bollards failed to lower.|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} {{explores the}} possibility of using commonly sourced local materials in the design and installation of a road barrier with Proximity Card Access Control. This study was carried out at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Benin, Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. The route used is the Engineering Access Road through 500 Lecture Theatre to University of Benin Staff School, which was formerly completely blocked off preventing staff from plying the route to and frotheir offices. Different methods were explored {{such as the use of}} retractable bollards and an operator controlled <b>bollard.</b> However, a <b>rising</b> arm <b>bollard</b> with necessary automatic controls was finally adopted. A screw jack was used to operate the raising arm mechanism because it is simpler but effective, more compact and involved the use of easily procurable components. An automated rising arm barrier with card, remote and call-in access controls was designed and installed on the Engineering access road which became accessible toauthorized staff via the card access control...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to campaigns {{from members of}} Liverpool's LGBT community, including Councillor Steve Radford, of Liverpool-based Liberal Party (UK, 1989), Liverpool City Council, has approved the partial pedestrianisation of Stanley Street, between Victoria Street and Dale Street. With the use of <b>rising</b> automatic hydraulic <b>bollards</b> from 10pm-6am every night, it is hoped the scheme will enhance the night time leisure experience of the Stanley Street Quarter. Many in Liverpool's LGBT community hope that Stanley Street could eventually become popular destination for the LGBT Community - perhaps Liverpool's answer to Canal Street (Manchester), home to Manchester's Gay Village. A report prepared by Feria Urbanism for Liverpool City Council in 2011 suggested the possibility of earlier closure of Stanley Street, from 6pm onwards each day.|$|R
