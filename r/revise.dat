40|$|<b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF (optimal linear {{discriminant}} function by integer programming) is a linear {{discriminant function}} to minimize the number of misclassifications (NM) of training samples by integer programming (IP). However, IP requires large computation (CPU) time. In this paper, it is proposed how to reduce CPU time by using linear programming (LP). In the first phase, <b>Revised</b> LP-OLDF is applied to all cases, and all cases are categorized into two groups: those that are classified correctly or {{those that are not}} classified by support vectors (SVs). In the second phase, <b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF is applied to the misclassified cases by SVs. This method is called <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF. In this research, it is evaluated whether NM of <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF is good estimate of the minimum number of misclassifications (MNM) by <b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF. Four kinds of the real data—Iris data, Swiss bank note data, student data, and CPD data—are used as training samples. Four kinds of 20, 000 re-sampling cases generated from these data are used as the evaluation samples. There are a total of 149 models of all combinations of independent variables by these data. NMs and CPU times of the 149 models are compared with <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF and <b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF. The following results are obtained: 1) <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF significantly improves CPU time. 2) In the case of training samples, all 149 NMs of <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF are equal to the MNM of <b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF. 3) In the case of evaluation samples, most NMs of <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF are equal to NM of <b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF. 4) Generalization abilities of both discriminant functions are concluded to be high, because the difference between the error rates of training and evaluation samples are almost within 2 %.   Therefore, <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF is recommended for the analysis of big data instead of <b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF. Next, <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF is compared with LDF and logistic regression by 100 -fold cross validation using 100 re-sampling samples. Means of error rates of <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF are remarkable fewer than those of LDF and logistic regression. </p...|$|R

5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to <b>revise</b> the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E
