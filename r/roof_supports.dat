5|$|Work {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they thought might be their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing respirators, several rescuers were overcome by the effects of firedamp. During {{the course of the}} day, 56 bodies were raised to the surface and, that evening, a new water supply, connected by three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) of pipes to a nearby reservoir, was installed in the Lancaster shaft.|$|E
25|$|Modern pillar {{sections}} use remote-controlled equipment, including large hydraulic mobile roof-supports, {{which can}} prevent cave-ins until the miners and their equipment {{have left a}} work area. The mobile <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> are similar to a large dining-room table, but with hydraulic jacks for legs. After the large pillars of coal have been mined away, the mobile roof support's legs shorten and it is withdrawn to a safe area. The mine roof typically collapses once the mobile <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> leave an area.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotive}} shed {{was capable of}} holding four locomotives and held an inspection pit.

The fumes would otherwise erode the iron <b>roof</b> <b>supports.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of machine designing is to balance between the economic requirements and the safety ones. Taking into account these requirements it was conducted the design work to elaborate the new concept of the mining <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> that fulfil them. The mining <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> is a mining equipment that has the most influence on the safety of work in deep coal mines and on the productivity of deep mines. Moreover the hydraulic <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> generally accounts for over 50 % of the total value of a coal mining and excavating system. It is considered not only with the complexity of the <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> but also with the accepted direction of the development of mining supports. Generally designers elaborate heavier constructions with props of larger diameters and loads. In this way the support system must be prepared not only to withdraw the rock mass forces but also the forces generated by its hydraulic system. These prerequisites underlie the new project of a <b>roof</b> <b>support.</b> This project bases also on many Polish patents concerning the mechanical devices and hydraulic equipment of a mining <b>roof</b> <b>support.</b> The main idea of the work was to elaborate the scheme of a support that will be compatible with the system of loads generated by the rock mass and by the conditions of work in a deep mine. As a result it was proposed the concept of a hydraulic <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> equipped with four props that work only in...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons of <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> {{failures}} in production faces is mismatch of their parameters and parameters of dynamic impact on the metal structure from the falling roof during its secondary convergences. To assess the parameters of vibrational interaction of <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> with the <b>roof,</b> it was suggested to use computational models of forces application and a partial differential equation of fourth order describing this process, its numerical solution allowed to assess frequency, amplitude and speed of roof strata movement depending on physical and mechanical properties of the roof strata as well as on load bearing and geometry parameters of the <b>roof</b> <b>support.</b> To simplify solving of the differential equation, <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> response was taken as the concentrated force...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Risk-based roadway <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> {{design is}} now a {{critical}} part of the Australian Coal Industry. Safe and efficient mining demands that <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> be tailored to the prevailing geotechnical conditions and legislation in both NSW and QLD is clear in requiring that formalised <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> design be undertaken. The assumption of dead-load suspension of an otherwise unstable roof has been used in roadway <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> design for many years. However longevity does not necessarily translate into either best or even reasonable practice in the current industry, particularly when pro-active strata management systems are now routinely used and reinforcing support design methods are available. The paper discusses why the assumption of dead-load suspension is fundamentally incorrect in almost all instances when pro-active or reinforcing <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> is being applied and how it can easily result in misleading and potentially under-designed <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> systems under various circumstances. The commonly used design methodology of balancing the installed axial capacity of long tendons with the assumed “weight ” of a future roof fall is summarised and several fundamental flaws are identified. The critical area of selecting the design Factor of Safety is also discussed in detail. Accepting that under certain circumstances the roof of a roadway will require to be “suspended”...|$|R

500|$|When {{planning}} the development, Manchester City Council required a sustainable landmark structure {{that would be}} an icon for the regeneration of the once heavily industrialised site surrounding Bradford Colliery, as well as providing spectators with good sightlines in an atmospheric arena. Arup Associates designed the stadium to be [...] "an intimate, even intimidating, gladiatorial arena embodying the atmosphere of a football club" [...] with the pitch six metres below ground level, a feature of Roman gladiatorial arenas and amphitheatres. The attention to detail, often absent in stadium design, has been remarked upon, including the cigar-shaped <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> with blue lighting beacons, sculpted rainwater gutters, poly-carbonate perimeter roof edging and openable louvres to aid pitch grass growth with similarities also made to high-tech architecture.|$|E
500|$|The West Wing is {{approximately}} [...] long, and has 37 heavy gun positions and two main magazines, along with various auxiliary buildings, including canteens, stores and detention facilities. It also has {{two of the}} castle's lighthouses, an 1865 tower, now disused, and an iron, gas-lit tower, still in use. The garden is a recreation of the garden in the Second World War. The late-19th century and early-20th guns at the castle were predominantly added to the West Wing, and it <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> emplacements for 12- and 6-pounder (5.4 and 2.7kg) quick-firing guns, a Bofors gun and associated directing positions.

30|$|The {{studies on}} the {{relationship}} between <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> and surrounding rock provide theories for the design and selection of LTCC <b>roof</b> <b>support,</b> the improvement of support-surrounding rock status and effective roof control (including top coals). In this paper, based {{on the relationship between}} <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> and surrounding rock, the authors propose a 3 D dynamic optimal design method with hydraulic support and surrounding rock coupling, and subsequently the determination of the working resistance of hydraulic support at the No. 8105 coal face in Tashan mine in Datong, China, and test on site.|$|R

2500|$|Longwall mining {{accounts}} for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of [...] or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically {{back and forth across}} a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.|$|E

40|$|Various <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> design methodologies {{have been}} used in Australian coal mines, which include analytical, {{numerical}} and empirical models. These models are mainly based on the deterministic approach in which a single factor of safety is calculated for the <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> design.
