The liquefied CO 2 (LCO 2) to be sequestered is directly injected into subseabed geological formations through a flexible <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> using injection facilities contained onboard an LCO 2 carrier ship. The flexible <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> remains on the seabed, one end attached to the injection wellhead, until the other end is hoisted up and connected to the (dynamic positioning system (DPS) -controlled) LCO 2 carrier ship arriving at the ocean injection site. This proposed system has various advantages {{over the use of}} stationary sea surface structures for ship mooring and CO 2 injection: i) no need for stationary sea surface structures, e. g., ship-mooring-buoy or platform; ii) simplifies ship handling, especially in rougher sea states; and iii) the flexible <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> can remain on the seabed in rough seas. Details of a pickup buoy system for retrieving the riser from the seabed and the structure of the flexible <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> are presented in this paper. The riser pickup system consists basically of shipboard equipment such as a coupling valve, crane, winches and A-frame and offshore equipment such as a pickup buoy, pickup float, messenger line, sinker and pickup wire rope.

40|$|Solar {{energy is}} one of the main sources of {{renewable}} energy that is abundantly available throughout the world. Solar energy can be used for useful purposes through a number of mechanical artefacts. One such artefact is known as Thermo-syphon, which typically contains water as its working fluid. One of the major applications of Thermo-syphon is within the residential and industrial units, where a constant supply of hot water is required. The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based solvers has recently been proven capable of predicting the flow behaviour within thermo-syphons with reasonable accuracy. Hence, the present study focuses on using a commercial CFD based solver to predict the flow behaviour within the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> of a thermo-syphon with varying solar heat flux and thermal loading conditions. In order to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the flow structure within the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> of the thermo-syphon, velocity magnitude and static temperature distributions within these pipes is analysed in detail. The results depict that the solar heat flux has a significant impact on the velocity magnitude and static temperature profiles within the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes.</b> Furthermore, it has been observed that the thermal loading has negligible effects on the velocity magnitude and static temperature profiles within the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes.</b> The data has also been used to develop novel design correlations...|$|R

There are two variations of offshore BOP in use; the sub-sea blowout preventer which sits on the ocean floor, and the surface blowout preventer which sits between the <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> and the drilling platform.

40|$|Variable-head {{permeability}} {{tests in}} soft soils with low hydraulic conductivity are frequently conducted without measuring {{the volume of}} water either added (falling-head test) or withdrawn (rising-head test) from the observation well. When this volume is measured, it is often found to differ from the volume calculated using the <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> section and the initial change in water height. Air storage effects and cavity deformation phenomena are {{generally considered to be}} the cause of this discrepancy. This paper first establishes a set of differential equations which can be solved to analyse test data where those two phenomena cannot be neglected. Cavity deformation and gas compressibility can also be evaluated in the field using a simple testing method presented herein. During this test, a known volume of water is either added to, or removed from a <b>riser</b> <b>pipe,</b> and compared to the volume calculated using the pipe section and the water height change.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{decrease}} reliance on fossil fuels, renewable energy {{has become an}} important topic of research in recent years. The development in the renewable energy source will help in meeting the requirements of limiting greenhouse-gas effects, and conserve the environment from pollution, global warming, ozone layer depletion, etc. There are various naturally available renewable energy sources. One of these sources is solar energy. Solar energy is available in abundance throughout the world and is the cleanest of all known energy sources. There are various devices {{that can be used}} to harness solar energy. One of such devices is a thermo-syphon. Thermo-syphon converts the solar energy obtained from the Sun into thermal energy of a working fluid. This thermal energy in the working fluid can be used for various industrial and household activities. In a closed loop thermo-syphon system, the working fluid circulates within the thermo-syphon loop via natural convection phenomenon and does not need any external devices, such as a pump. Therefore, it is considered to be one of the most efficient devices for the heat transfer. Moreover, the absence of a pumping device reduces the manufacturing and maintenance costs of a thermo-syphon system. The heat exchange process in the thermo-syphon is a complicated process, which considers the heat convection phenomenon. Therefore, to understand the natural convection process in the thermo-syphon and their effect on the thermal performance of the system a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based techniques have been used. Numerical results obtained have been verified against the experimental results, and they match closely with each other. The comparison between the CFD and experimental result, suggest that CFD can be used as an effective tool to analyse the performance of a thermo-syphon with reasonable accuracy. In order to investigate the flow structure within the thermo-syphon system, detailed qualitative and quantitative analyses have been carried out in the present study. The qualitative analysis of the flow field includes descriptions of the velocity magnitude and the static temperature distributions contours within the closed loop thermo-syphon system. Furthermore, the variation in the temperature of water within the storage tank, temperature of the working fluid, heat transfer coefficient, wall shear stress, and local velocity and temperature distribution of the working fluid within thermo-syphon loop have been quantified as a function of time. In addition, numerical studies have been conducted to identify the effects of various geometrical parameters, which include the number of the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes,</b> length-to-diameter ratio of the <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> on the thermal performance of a closed loop thermo-syphon system. Moreover, a further investigation has been carried out to analyse the effect of various heat flux conditions and different transient thermal loadings on the thermal performance of a closed loop thermo-syphon system. Based on these analyses some novel semi-empirical relations have been developed to predict the thermal performance of the thermo-syphon, which is one of the focal points of this research. Another goal of the current study is to improve the thermal performance characteristic of thermo-syphon solar water heating system using an enhancement device to improve the heat transfer. This aspect of the work focuses on the increasing energy conversion from the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> to the working fluid within the thermo-syphon loop. This is accomplished by increasing the surface area of <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> by employing several design modifications, such as straight, wavy and helical <b>pipes,</b> within the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes,</b> while maintaining the amount of the working fluid constant within the closed loop thermo-syphon system. In this study, a comparative analysis has been carried out for these new design modifications to identify the best in terms of heat transfer coefficient, heat gain in collector etc., as an indication of thermal performance. According to the findings of this analysis, the model comprising of <b>pipe</b> inside the <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> depict better thermal performance as compared to other models. After defining the best design modification, a further detailed investigation has been carried out between the traditional and modified design (straight <b>pipe</b> inside the <b>riser</b> <b>pipe)</b> using experimental and numerical method. Established methods regarding the design process of thermo-syphons are very limited, and they are severely limited in estimating important design parameters, such as useful heat gain and heat transfer coefficient, which have a significant impact on the thermal performance of thermo-syphon system/loop. A design methodology has been developed to enrich the design process of a closed loop thermo-syphon solar water heating system. The developed methodology is more efficient and reliable since it is capable of estimating various geometrical and thermal parameters, such as collector area, diameter and length of the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes,</b> distance between the centers of the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes,</b> heat transfer coefficient, temperature of the working fluid and the mass flow rate.

50|$|A design {{weakness}} of earlier classes solved by the Tench re-design were the ballast tank vent <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> that {{passed through the}} interior of the boat in the forward and after torpedo rooms. These pipes allowed #1 and #7 Main Ballast Tanks (MBT) (located in the single hull sections of the boat) to vent air during diving and allowing water to flood into them from below. The tops of these tanks formed the walking deck in the interior of both rooms and thus the normal location of the vent valves (the top of the tank) could not be used. The <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> allowed the tanks to vent but when the tanks were full these pipes contained water at full submergence pressure inside the torpedo rooms. If these pipes ruptured during depth charge attack, catastrophic flooding would occur. Solving this problem initially proved quite difficult, but ultimately required the complete rearrangement of the ballast tanks. #1 MBT was moved to a location forward {{of the end of the}} pressure hull, thus allowing it to vent directly into the superstructure like the rest of the MBT's. This move eliminated the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> completely. #7 MBT, after stability and buoyancy calculations were run was found to be redundant and was converted to a variable fuel oil tank as mentioned above. These changes forced the rearrangement of the associated piping runs and the location of many of the other tanks.

40|$|The main {{concerns}} during drilling {{operations are}} riser integrity and maintaining well control. This thesis has mainly been {{focusing on the}} problems and challenges faced with the marine riser system to illuminate high risk areas related to riser integrity. A marine riser system consists generally of four main elements; the upper marine riser package, riser joints, lower marine riser package, and the blowout preventer, each playing {{an important part in}} the marine riser system. The marine riser function is to supports and guide the auxiliary lines used to control the well, and connect and provide for fluid communication between the drilling vessel and the wellhead. Failure to the marine riser is related to technical problems associated with old design and lack of correct operating procedure and maintenance method. Elements like the telescopic joint haven’t change the design since the 1960 ’s and are exposed to problems like unplanned discharge caused of premature war to the packer element. Problems with the telescopic joint are not unique there are also experienced failure with tensioner system, flex joint and blowout preventer. Studies show that blowout preventer failure cases the longest downtime and most expensive repairs. Over 50 % of blowout preventer failures are related to the control system and are caused by failure to the hydraulic components. Exploration activity forces the drilling contractor further out and into deeper water depths, like the Gulf of Mexico or outside the Coast of Brazil. Greater water depths challenge the riser system on many places. Deepwater operations means harsher environment and problems in the forms of large waves, strong currents and increased pressure from the water column, all affecting the operations and <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> in several ways. The environmental issues causes the riser to fail due to increased tensile load, vortex induced vibrations, environmentally induced cracks and increased corrosion attacks. The increased tensile load on the <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> place importance on the top tension capacity of the rig and the <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> wall thickness. Moving into deeper ground, many rigs reach their tension capacity and must use buoyancy modules to provide sufficient tension to the riser. Many of the problems could be addressed using simple solution, like implementing correct maintenance program or address the issues in the design phase. But economical impetus holds the development back.

As developments move into deeper water the understanding of structural performance of the riser can become critical to operational longevity. SCRs can be prone to fatigue damage, especially in the region where the <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> reaches the seabed - known as the touchdown zone'. The results of a fatigue assessment depend significantly on the assumed pipe-soil interaction conditions at the touchdown zone, which remains an area of uncertainty for designers. Typical experimental investigations into the problem focus on the two-dimensional elemental response of a short section of <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> with the soil in order to calibrate interaction models. This paper describes a different approach, where the three-dimensional response of the riser with the seabed is explored experimentally. The experimental equipment described represents the first such apparatus used to investigate 3 D riser-soil interaction under controlled conditions in a laboratory. The model <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> was 7. 65 m long and 110 mm in diameter and was loaded by both monotonic and cyclic motions via a computer-controlled actuation system. A range of instrumentation {{was used to assess}} the structural response of the model riser as well as trench formation and the development of excess water/pore pressures. In these experiments the pipe was placed on a bed of sand for benchmarking purposes although future experiments will explore the response in clay soils which are typically encountered in the locations where SCRs are used. Numerical analysis was used to determine an appropriate form for the distribution of soil reaction {{along the length of the}} pipe, in response to the uplift of the model pipe. Results from the numerical analysis displayed good agreement with the experimental data. A simple methodology is outlined for the back-calculation of the distribution of soil bearing stress beneath the model pipe. This provides a link between the 3 D test results and the more typically conducted 2 D tests, allowing the verification of pipe-soil interaction models derived from 2 D experiments.

The Agua Clara project is working to design and build water treatment plants in Honduras, which is among the poorest countries in the world. Major {{emphasis is placed on}} the integration of the plants into the communities effectively. Careful consideration is made regarding the specific requirements for each community. In the neighborhoods with the greatest need for water purification technologies there is often an intermittent flow of electricity. Current water treatment designs control chemical dosing and flow rates with electrically powered pumps and sensors. The intermittent electricity supply combined with the current system design would result in intermittent supply of ?treated water,? water sent intermittently through pipelines is no longer considered pure because during shut-down the pipelines will form a vacuum pressure pulling surrounding material into the pipe space contaminating future water flows. The Agua Clara design requires no input of electricity for operation of the plant. Water flows through the plant from high elevation to low elevation; elevation change is the energy source for the water treatment. The water is treated through 4 processes. The first step in water treatment is a grit chamber which removes the large objects such as branches from the water flow using a large spacing metal grid. Water is then treated with a coagulant, aluminum hydroxide, and sent through a flocculation tank. The coagulant binds to the foreign particles (contaminants) in the water and creates flocs, similar to a snowflake. The flocs increase in size as they move through the flocculation tank. Sedimentation follows the flocculation stage, the large flocs are settled out and the clean water is drawn of the top of the sedimentation tank. As a final measure the purified water is treated with chlorine to kill any bacteria remaining the water and provide a residual chlorine concentration for disinfection during transport. My research is focused on the dosing of aluminum hydroxide to the water. Currently the operator of the plant manually adjusts the flow rate of aluminum hydroxide as the flow rate through the treatment plant changes. Automation of the process is required to more rapidly and reliably meter alum to the inflow. The automation process is designed using an entrance tank, <b>riser</b> <b>pipe,</b> and float system. The contaminated water flows into the entrance tank the through a <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> and then empties into the flocculation tank. A system of floats and lever arms change the flow rate of alum based on the height of the water in the entrance tank. The height of water in the entrance tank is based on the outflow of water through orifices in a <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> located in the entrance tank. The height in the water in the entrance tank with a single outflow orifice is correlated to the square root of the flow rate according to the orifice equation. This relationship makes metering aluminum hydroxide through a float system nearly impossible. Linearization of the head of the water in the entrance tank as a function of flow rate is the goal of my project. If the pattern of orifices on the <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> can be situated to create a linear relationship between water height in the entrance tank and the flow rate through the plant then the float system can easily adjust the alum flow rate...|$|R

This thesis has mainly been {{focusing on the}} problems and challenges faced with the marine riser system to illuminate high risk areas related to riser integrity. A marine riser system consists generally of four main elements; the upper marine riser package, riser joints, lower marine riser package, and the blowout preventer, each playing {{an important part in}} the marine riser system. The marine riser function is to supports and guide the auxiliary lines used to control the well, and connect and provide for fluid communication between the drilling vessel and the wellhead. Failure to the marine riser is related to technical problems associated with old design and lack of correct operating procedure and maintenance method. Elements like the telescopic joint haven’t change the design since the 1960 ’s and are exposed to problems like unplanned discharge caused of premature war to the packer element. Problems with the telescopic joint are not unique there are also experienced failure with tensioner system, flex joint and blowout preventer. Studies show that blowout preventer failure cases the longest downtime and most expensive repairs. Over 50 % of blowout preventer failures are related to the control system and are caused by failure to the hydraulic components. Exploration activity forces the drilling contractor further out and into deeper water depths, like the Gulf of Mexico or outside the Coast of Brazil. Greater water depths challenge the riser system on many places. Deepwater operations means harsher environment and problems in the forms of large waves, strong currents and increased pressure from the water column, all affecting the operations and <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> in several ways. The environmental issues causes the riser to fail due to increased tensile load, vortex induced vibrations, environmentally induced cracks and increased corrosion attacks. The increased tensile load on the <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> place importance on the top tension capacity of the rig and the <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> wall thickness. Moving into deeper ground, many rigs reach their tension capacity and must use buoyancy modules to provide sufficient tension to the riser. Many of the problems could be addressed using simple solution, like implementing correct maintenance program or address the issues in the design phase. But economical impetus holds the development back. Solutions like redesign of the telescopic joint and blowout preventer is advised by operators, but some of the solution are proven to be economical unprofitable...|$|R

5000|$|On September 8, 2010, BP {{released}} a 193-page report on its web site. The report says BP employees {{and those of}} Transocean did not correctly interpret a pressure test, and both companies neglected ominous signs such as a <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> losing fluid. It also says that while BP did not listen to recommendations by Halliburton for more centralizers (devices to keep the casing from contacting the bore hole), the lack of centralizers probably {{did not affect the}} cement. BP also said the crew should have redirected the flow of flammable gases. The blowout preventer, removed on September 4, had not reached a NASA facility in time for it {{to be part of the}} report. Transocean, responding to the report, blamed [...] "BP's fatally flawed well design." ...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} share the work {{presented}} at the conference, a selection of papers was made {{which resulted in the}} present Special Issue. The first paper by Quintino et al. is related to training and qualification of adhesive bonding personnel at the European level by the European Welding Federation (EWF). The courses are offered, namely European Adhesive Engineer, European Adhesive Specialist and European Adhesive Bonder. These courses are useful for companies to benefit from improved competitiveness in the global market place and from an increased likelihood of trouble-free production and service performance of their products. In the next paper, Paiva et al. study the importance of the surface treatment in the peeling strength of joints for the shoe industry. The authors considered the following materials: natural leather, thermoplastic rubber (TR), polyurethane (PU) and a polyurethane non structural adhesive solvent based. This work allows manufacturers of footwear to minimize the number of operations in the manufacture of shoes, while still being capable of satisfying the minimum requirements for the sector. In the third paper, Zhang et al. analysed the strength of adhesive joints of <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> in deep sea environment loadings such as external pressure, internal pressure, tension, torsion, bending loadings. The authors conclude that singular stress fields exist around the end of the interface. The <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> under external pressure, internal pressure and tension loading is more prone to break than under bending and torque loading. The last paper by Valoroso and De Barros is related to adhesive joint computations using cohesive zones. Numerical results are presented for a double cantilever beam geometry with varying thickness for which bilinear and exponential cohesive laws are considered. The authors conclude that the size of the process zone is found to be quite sensitive to the specimen characteristic size.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the use of}} {{elevated}} {{water storage}} tanks has existed since ancient times in various forms, the modern use of water towers for pressurized public water systems developed during the mid-19th century, as steam-pumping became more common, and better pipes that could handle higher pressures were developed. In the United Kingdom, standpipes consisted of tall, exposed, n-shaped pipes, used for pressure relief {{and to provide a}} fixed elevation for steam-driven pumping engines which tended to produce a pulsing flow, while the pressurized water distribution system required constant pressure. Standpipes also provided a convenient fixed location to measure flow rates. Designers typically enclosed the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> in decorative masonry or wooden structures. By the late 19th-Century, standpipes grew to include storage tanks to meet the ever-increasing demands of growing cities.|$|R
