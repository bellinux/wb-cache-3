40|$|Introduction: The {{burden of}} lifestyle-associated disease is {{increasing}} with a preventative approach to health becoming {{more of a}} focus. Within the oncology setting, the importance of supporting patients with positive lifestyle changes post treatment is included within the recently developed recovery package and the contribution of therapeutic radiographers will be significant {{in the implementation of}} this. Method: A 23 -question survey tool was distributed via the online platform Survey Monkey. The questionnaire was promoted online through the Society and College of Radiographers (SCoR). All members of the SCoR had access to the questionnaire to allow for assessment of health improvement provision nationally. Quantitative and qualitative data were acquired and analysed using the statistical package for the social sciences, descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results: <b>Therapy</b> <b>radiographers</b> recognise importance of health promotion. Highest levels of provision were observed with smoking cessation and lowest levels of provision observed on the topic of exercise. Key barriers identified were staff responsibility and lack of knowledge and training of <b>therapy</b> <b>radiographers.</b> Discussion: Health improvement is part {{of the role of the}} <b>therapy</b> <b>radiographer</b> and is delivered within UK radiotherapy departments; however, there is scope to increase delivery with the identification and overcoming of barriers to provision...|$|R
40|$|D. Tech. (Radiography) <b>Therapy</b> <b>radiographers</b> {{generally}} {{start their}} careers {{excited to be}} part of a medical environment and enthusiastic about the rapid technological advancement that they can envisage being a part of. Typically, in an oncology setting, a naive enthusiasm for helping patients with cancer rapidly spirals into disillusionment as the stress of working in a profession with no room for error and little opportunity for career advancement takes its toll. Radiography literature has focused on identifying problems such as stress, burnout and a lack of organisational commitment without any constructive attempt to look for the positive attributes of the profession that could assist <b>therapy</b> <b>radiographers</b> to achieve professional or personal wholeness (Akroyd, Caison & Adams, 2002 : 818; Rutter & Lovegrove, 2008 : 140; Makanjee, Hartzer & Uys, 2006 : 121; Probst & Griffiths, 2007 : 22). The purpose of this theory generating study was to describe the process of being a <b>therapy</b> <b>radiographer</b> in an oncology department of a tertiary hospital in Gauteng. This served as the basis for the development of a model to facilitate wholeness as part of a professional identity for <b>therapy</b> <b>radiographers.</b> The study utilised a qualitative theory generating research design, using appreciative inquiry to identify a central concept for the model development. The philosophy of science that guided the research design was that of a post-modern constructivist paradigm. The population for the research were the <b>therapy</b> <b>radiographers</b> employed at a Radiation Oncology Department in a tertiary hospital in Gauteng. Purposeful sampling was used to select participants. Data collection utilised focus group interviews employing an appreciative enquiry interview technique and reflective field notes were taken during and after each focus group interview. Data analysis was conducted by means of open coding as described by Creswell (2003 : 190 - 195). The central concept was defined by identifying central criteria by means of a dictionary and subject literature. The concepts identified were written into relationship statements in order to develop a preliminary conceptual model as the framework for the research. A conceptual model was developed using Chinn and Kramer’s (2011 : 152 - 205) process for empiric knowledge development. Guidelines to operationalize the model were described to assist the clinical application of the model in a radiotherapy setting. The model was evaluated by means of critical reflection...|$|R

40|$|Key themes The {{paper will}} focus on key themes that have {{impacted}} on advanced practice for <b>therapy</b> <b>radiographers</b> such as government initiatives and policy, confounding terminology associated with advanced practice such as role extension, role expansion, role development, and expert practice. The theory and development of expert practice is explored and paralleled to existing roles in therapy using the Benner model to define stages of professional development and competence. Evidence for advanced practice, and education and training will also be explored. All of these issues will be considered within {{the perspective of the}} current clinical and political environment that <b>therapy</b> <b>radiographers</b> operate in. Conclusions The application of advanced practice can and should incorporate elements of role extension and role development, with some tangible skills ladder to guide and shape the development of potential consultant practitioners. There is a need to identify the current position of advanced practice nationally, and to monitor existing and emerging roles, possibly though a longitudinal study. The skill mix as a whole within departments need to be part of an ongoing evaluation with close collaboration between the professional body, departmental managers and higher education institutes to develop curricula to support existing and emerging roles. There are also key lessons to be learned from other professions with more experience with advanced practitioners if recruitment and retention is not {{going to continue to be}} a problem. </p...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the current}} major {{challenges}} in clinical imaging is modeling and prediction of respiratory motion, for example, in nuclear medicine or external-beam <b>radio</b> <b>therapy.</b> This paper presents preliminary work in {{developing a method for}} modeling and predicting the temporal behavior of the anterior surface position during respiration. This is achieved by tracking the anterior surface during respiration and projecting the captured motion sequence data into a lower dimensional space using Principle Component Analysis and extracting the variation in the Abdominal surface and Thoracic surface separately. Modeling is based on learning the multivariate probability distribution of the motion sequence using a joint Probability Distribution Function (PDF) between the variation of the Thoracic surface and Abdomen surface in the Eigen space. Moreover, the prediction model encodes the amplitude of the variation in the Eigen space for both Thoracic surface and Abdominal surface and the derivative of the variation which reflects the motion path (velocity). The joint Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of the prediction model covers the likelihood of each position/phase configuration and the associated maximum-likelihood motion path. Moreover, feeding the real-time tracking data into the model during nuclear medicine acquisition or external-beam <b>radio</b> <b>therapy</b> will facilitate adjusting the model for any changes and overcome irregularities in the observed respiration cycle...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of CT anatomy is {{increasingly}} vital in daily radiotherapy practice, especially with more {{widespread use of}} cross-sectional image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) techniques. Existing CT anatomy texts are predominantly written for the diagnostic practitioner and do not always address the radiotherapy issues while emphasising structures that are not common to radiotherapy practice. CT Anatomy for Radiotherapy is a new radiotherapy-specific text that is intended to prepare the reader for CT interpretation for both IGRT and treatment planning. It is suitable for undergraduate students, qualified <b>therapy</b> <b>radiographers,</b> dosimetrists and may {{be of interest to}} oncologists and registrars engaged in treatment planning. All essential structures relevant to radiotherapy are described and depicted on 3 D images generated from radiotherapy planning systems. System-based labelled CT images taken in relevant imaging planes and patient positions build up understanding of relational anatomy and CT interpretation. Images are accompanied by comprehensive commentary to aid with interpretation. This simplified approach is used to empower the reader to rapidly gain image interpretation skills. The book pays special attention to lymph node identification as well as featuring a unique section on Head and Neck Deep Spaces to help understanding of common pathways of tumour spread. Fully labelled CT images using radiotherapy-specific views and positioning are complemented where relevant by MR and fusion images. A brief introduction to image interpretation using IGRT devices is also covered. The focus of the book is on radiotherapy and some images of common tumour pathologies are utilised to illustrate some relevant abnormal anatomy. Short self-test questions help to keep the reader engaged throughout...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{order to}} test for {{mechanisms}} of whole brain <b>radio</b> <b>therapy</b> side effects and possible neuroprotective measures, a rodent model is desirable. In many models, a high single dose of 8 - 20 Gray (Gy) of whole brain irradiation is used. These experimental radiation protocols do not closely reflect the clinical situation, where the cumulative dosage is applied in smaller fractions. We describe an efficient method to perform repetitive, fractionated whole brain <b>radio</b> <b>therapy</b> to the rat brain. METHODS: Fifteen-week-old rats were irradiated with a dose of 5 or 10 Gy on four consecutive days, resulting in a cumulative dose in opposing fields of 20 Gy (n = 15) and 40 Gy (n = 17), respectively. Sham-irradiated rats (n = 14) received the same procedure but without application of cranial irradiation. Four collimators with a diameter of 3 cm each were used to place four rats and an ionization chamber simultaneously in the dose field for monitoring. RESULTS: Fourteen days after the procedure, irradiated animals showed decreased open-field activity (two-tailed t-test, sham versus 20 Gy, P< 0. 001; sham versus 40 Gy, P = 0. 002), but no cognitive deficit as indicated by latencies in the Morris water maze test. Six weeks after the irradiation, no group showed alterations of histopathology such as vascular changes, demyelination, or white matter necrosis. DISCUSSION: The proposed model represents an efficient and safe method to perform fractioned high-dose irradiation of the rodent brain. Speculatively, {{it is possible to}} increase the cumulative dosage and dose per fraction used in this model to achieve a higher degree of radiation-induced toxicity...|$|R
