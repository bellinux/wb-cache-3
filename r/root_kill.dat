40|$|An {{aqueous extract}} of Ephedra equisetina root {{was found to}} induce cyanobacterial cell death. The extract {{displayed}} no negative effects on the fish populations but instead, improved the habitat conditions {{for the growth of}} macrophytes, zooplankton and bacteria because the inhibiting effects of the extracts on cyanobacteria helped clear up the water column. The removal kinetics of cyanobacteria by E. equisetina extract appears to be a first order process with the rate constant being extract-dose-dependent. Compounds including the flavonoids found in E. equisetina <b>root</b> <b>kill</b> the cyanobacteria in vitro at a dose of 5. 0 Âµg extract per 100 mL water or above. The extract constituents act to disrupt the thylakoid membrane, interrupt the electronic transport, decrease the effective quantum yield, and eventually lead to the failure of photosynthesis in Microcystis aeruginosa. This study presents an easily-deployed, natural and promising approach for controlling cyanobacterial blooms as an emergency measure, and also provides insight into the dynamics and mechanism of the extract consisting of multiple compounds synergistically removing algae...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Root rot of {{ponderosa pine}} caused by Armillaria mellea was studied in a pine forest {{that had been}} under {{management}} for 30 years in Klickitat County, Washington. Information sources included disease survey, detailed observation and description of specific disease situations, and examination of roots in situ and removed. Roughly circular infection centers in stands of sapling and pole-sized pines appear to arise regularly from stumps of harvested old-growth trees, {{some of which have}} contained viable A. mellea for over 30 years. Distinctive concentric zones caused by the disease mark the infection centers. These zones differ in above-ground appearance, in degree of root decomposition, and in level of infection. Location of a specific zone depends on the interval since cutting of the old-growth tree, while zone width depends on tree sizes in the young stand. Distribution of root material in the interior zones is influenced most strongly by rooting characteristics of the former old-growth trees, and by activity of A. mellea and other decay agents over time, while in the young growth pines of the intermediate zones, time since lethal attack by A. mellea and tree size most influence root condition. Extensive examination of the outer zones disclosed that, in stands containing trees from 3 to 6 inches in diameter, infected root material extended into the healthy-appearing pines 11 ft beyond the outermost dead tree of the infection center, while in stands with trees up to 16 inches in diameter the extent reached 18 ft. A highly significant linear regression with good correlation was found between: 1) the extent of infected root material beyond the outermost dead tree; and 2) mean tree size of the affected stand. Infected root segments from beyond the outermost dead tree, within the region where infected and healthy roots intermingle, produced rhizomorphs, the assumed infection structures, when incubated in bags of moist quartz sand. The expansion rate of infection centers was calculated to be 2. 9 ft (0. 88 m) /year. Cross plating techniques indicated that the 1500 acre study area was occupied by a single strain of A. mellea, suggesting that spores are unimportant to the field disease cycle. Current loss to disease in the 1500 acre tract is 35 cu ft per acre per yr, three times the loss in 1957. From 1957 to 1971, the proportion of the area in which disease was detectable remained constant. The increased loss resulted from death of fewer, but larger, trees in 1971. In inoculation tests on ponderosa pine seedlings, A. mellea isolates from old-growth pine stumps and from young pine trees were pathogenic, while isolates from living hardwoods were weakly or nonpathogenic. Reliable methods are described for isolating A. mellea from infected tissues and of testing the capacity of naturally infected root materials to produce rhizomorphs. The abundance of A. mellea over a three year interval following five root removal treatments increased in missed root residues. Resinous lesions were commonly found at the site of A. mellea attack. Rarely does mycelium spread proximally along a living root from one of these lesions, but growth frequently occurs from the lesion toward the root tip following, or concurrent with death of the extremity. Girdling resinous lesions on lateral roots show little effect on tree vigor, while such lesions high on the tap <b>root</b> <b>kill</b> the tree. Soon after tree death, mycelial fans spread under the bark throughout the root system. To obtain insight on how the resinous lesions retard the fungus, tests were conducted on the effects of resin on growth of A. mellea in culture. Autoclaved resin, acetone extracts of resin, water extracts of resin, and non-sterilized resin all stimulated, rather than restricted, growth over non-resin containing media. Removal of phenols from the water extract of resin with polyvinylpyrrolidone destroyed the growth stimulating effect of the resin. Propylene oxide was effective for sterilization of granulated resin...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} mechanisms {{involved in}} inhibition of maize (Zea mays L.) leaf-elongation growth following addition of non-penetrating osmolyte {{to the root}} medium. The elongation rate of the first true leaf remained inhibited for 4 h after addition of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG; - 0. 5 MPa water potential), despite progressive osmotic adjustment in the growing leaf tissues. Thus, inhibition of leaf growth {{did not appear to}} be directly related to loss of leaf capacity to maintain osmotic potential gradients. Comparative cell-wall-extension capacities of immature (still expanding) leaf tissues were measured by creep extensiometry using whole plants. Reductions in irreversible (plastic) extension capacity (i. e. wall hardening) were detected minutes and hours after addition of PEG to the roots, by both in vivo and in vitro assay. The onset of the wall-hardening response could be detected by in vitro assay only 2 min after addition of PEG. Thus, initiation of wall hardening appeared to precede transcription-regulated responses. The inhibition of both leaf growth and wall-extension capacity was reversed by removal of PEG after 4 h. Moreover, wall hardening could be induced by other osmolytes (mannitol, NaCl). Thus, the leaf responses {{did not appear to be}} related to any specific (toxic) effect of PEG. We conclude that hardening of leaf cell walls is a primary event in the chain of growth regulatory responses to PEG-induced water deficits in maize. The signaling processes by which PEG, which is not expected to penetrate root cell walls or membranes, might cause cell-wall hardening in relatively distant leaves was also investigated. Plants with live or <b>killed</b> <b>roots</b> were exposed to PEG. The <b>killed</b> <b>roots</b> were presumed to be unable to produce hormonal or electrical signals in response to addition of PEG; however, inhibition of leaf elongation and hardening of leaf cell walls were detected with both live and <b>killed</b> <b>roots.</b> Thus, neither hormonal signaling nor signaling via induced changes in surface electrical potential were necessary, and hydraulic signals appeared to generate the leaf responses...|$|R

50|$|Blueberry shock {{virus is}} pollen-borne and likely infects during pollination. Bees and other insects {{that come into}} contact with the {{infected}} pollen can transmit the virus as well. The virus can spread quickly once established in the field. Once infected, the plant suffers from flower and leaf blight and dieback. Symptoms begin to appear just prior to bloom and can continue to develop during bloom. Eventually, after one to two years the shoots grow back and the infected plant may regain fruit production again. When the plants fully recover, they once again produce a full crop. However, their pollen {{will continue to be a}} source of inoculum and spread the virus to other blueberry plants, making it difficult to control. Management of the disease involves preventing introduction of the virus to non-infected plants. Suckers and plant material should be tested for the virus before introduction into a nursery or field. If plants do become infected with the disease either the few plants infected can be removed and burned or the whole field may need to be. Herbicides are also sprayed to ensure that the <b>root</b> is <b>killed,</b> leaving no infected suckers in the ground.

Solid-state nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was applied to study the chemical alteration of the stable soil organic matter (SOM) pool in various savanna soils from Southern Brazil after ceasing annual burning. Irrespective of the time passed since the last fire, the topsoils showed the typical pattern of humifying unburnt material, with considerable low contributions of pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM), although stopping the fire decreased the organic-C content. The latter is most tentatively caused by the reduced input of decaying <b>roots</b> of <b>killed</b> plants and lower biomass production due to the missing of the liming effect of fire. Unexpected high aromaticity was detected for the SOM in the deeper soil (15 - 45 cm). This is attributable to increasing accumulation of PyOM that had been transported through the soil column.
