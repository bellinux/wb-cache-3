40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} described in the thesis has been to improve the accuracy, precision and reliability of an ultrasonic densitometer for liquids in general. Its practical application is a stand-alone device or, in combination with an ultrasonic volumetric flow meter, an all-ultrasonic mass flow meter. The work shows that the densitometer is reliable at different though steady temperatures. Changes in temperature alter {{the characteristics of the}} densitometer. Recognition of one of these alterations enables one to compensate for the thermal influence. The presence of thermal gradients in the densitometer due to thermal transients can be recognized and handled properly. A simulation tool is <b>refined</b> to <b>aid</b> {{in the design of the}} densitometer to include spectral and thermal dependencies of the sensor materials. The model described by the simulation tool is compared successfully with actual ultrasonic systems. The simulation tool is used to predict the received electrical signal of a two-transducer ultrasonic mass flow meter. The simulation tool is also used to investigate the effects of transducer variations on flow measurement errors in a volumetric flow meter. When the two transducers are not identical, there is a difference in the times of flight of the ultrasonic pulses used to calculate the flow velocity, which should not occur when the fluid is stationary. The simulation tool is based on the electronic simulation software SPICE, which aids in the design of the associated electronics. To incorporate the spectral and thermal dependencies of polymers used in the densitometer into the simulation tool, their characteristics have been explored. The superposition of frequency and temperature of their characteristics is used and parametric surfaces are proposed. The problem however is that those characteristics are not commonly found for most polymers. Signal processing techniques are applied to two densitometers for solids to illustrate the extraction of information from the measured signals as well as their drawbacks. The same signal processing methods provide the densitometer for liquids a means to achieve better accuracy, precision and reliability. Godkänd; 2001; 20061113 (haneit) </p...|$|R

Some drugs, like cocaine and morphine, are extracted from plant sources and <b>refined</b> with the <b>aid</b> of chemicals. Semi-synthetic drugs such as heroin are made starting from alkaloids extracted from plant sources which are the precursors for further synthesis. In the case of heroin, a mixture of alkaloids is extracted from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) by incising its seed capsule - a milky fluid bleeds out of the incisions which is then left to dry out and scraped off the bulbs, yielding raw opium. Morphine, one of many alkaloids in opium, is then extracted out of the opium by acid-base extraction and turned into heroin by reacting it with acetic anhydride. Other drugs (such as methamphetamine and MDMA) are normally made from commercially available chemicals, though both can also be made from naturally occurring precursors. Methamphetamine can also be made from ephedrine, one of the naturally occurring alkaloids in ephedra (Ephedra sinica). MDMA {{can be made from}} safrole, the major constituent of several etheric oils like sassafras.

There are various prognostic factors in renal cell cancer. We have demonstrated that some of these such as nuclear grading, tumour necrosis and systemic inflammatory response can be further <b>refined</b> to <b>aid</b> in prognosis but cannot be utilised at present to assess which would benefit from therapeutic agents when recurrence occurs. We investigated if SFK members are expressed in renal cancer. Eight SFK members were found to be expressed in renal cancer and were present to varying degrees. Furthermore, expression differed in organ confined disease and metastatic disease. Immunohistochemistry was employed to assess protein expression and activation of c-Src and SFK activity as well as the downstream marker FAK Y 861. Analysis demonstrated that c-Src expression was associated with improved survival and expression of the downstream marker FAK Y 861 was associated with poor survival and demonstrated a positive relationship with known prognostic factors. This would suggest that another SFK member was associated with poor survival. Dasatinib, a SFK inhibitor was utilised on renal cell lines, demonstrating a dose dependant reduction on cellular metabolic activity as well an increase in apoptotic rates. This would support that Dasatinib may be a useful therapeutic drug for RCC. Treatment with Dasatinib also demonstrated that expression of c-Src, SFK activity and FAK Y 861 reduced in a dose dependant manner. It was necessary to further assess that another SFK member was responsible for poor prognosis and this was undertaken by silencing c-Src. Cellular metabolic activity rates increased following silencing c-Src and assessment of SFK activity (Src Y 416) and FAK Y 861 on cell pellets demonstrated no change suggesting that another SFK member is responsible for the phosphorylation of FAK Y 861 and therefore responsible for poor survival. This would suggest that another SFK inhibitor and not c-Src inhibitors {{may play a role in}} the treatment of renal cell cancer and further work is required to ascertain which SFK member is responsible so that this can be targeted for treatment...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{is engaged}} in an {{initiative}} to risk-inform the regulation of byproduct materials. Operating experience indicates that human actions play a dominant role {{in most of the}} activities involving byproduct materials, which are radioactive materials other than those used in nuclear power plants or in weapons production, primarily for medical or industrial purposes. The overall risk of these activities is strongly influenced by human performance. Hence, an improved understanding of human error, its causes and contexts, and human reliability analysis (HRA) is important in risk-informing the regulation of these activities. The development of the human performance job aids was undertaken by stages, with frequent interaction with the prospective users. First, potentially risk significant human actions were identified based on reviews of available risk studies for byproduct material applications and of descriptions of events for byproduct materials applications that involved potentially significant human actions. Applications from the medical and the industrial domains were sampled. Next, the specific needs of the expected users of the human performance-related capabilities were determined. To do this, NRC headquarters and region staff were interviewed to identify the types of activities (e. g., license reviews, inspections, event assessments) that need HRA support and the form in which such support might best be offered. Because the range of byproduct uses regulated by NRC is so broad, it was decided that initial development of knowledge and tools would be undertaken {{in the context of a}} specific use of byproduct material, which was selected in consultation with NRC staff. Based on needs of NRC staff and the human performance related characteristics of the context chosen, knowledge resources were then compiled to support consideration of human performance issues related to the regulation of byproduct materials.

40|$|Abstract Background Decision aids {{have been}} {{developed}} {{in a number of}} health disciplines to support evidence-informed decision making, including patient decision aids and clinical practice guidelines. However, policy contexts differ from clinical contexts in terms of complexity and uncertainty, requiring different approaches for identifying, interpreting, and applying many different types of evidence to support decisions. With few studies in the literature offering decision guidance specifically to health policymakers, the present study aims to facilitate the structured and systematic incorporation of research evidence and, where there is currently very little guidance, values and other non-research-based evidence, into the policy making process. The resulting decision aid is intended to help public sector health policy decision makers who are tasked with making evidence-informed decisions on behalf of populations. The intent is not to develop a decision aid that will yield uniform recommendations across jurisdictions, but rather to facilitate more transparent policy decisions that reflect a balanced consideration of all relevant factors. Methods/design The study comprises three phases: a modified meta-narrative review, the use of focus groups, and the application of a Delphi method. The modified meta-narrative review will inform the initial development of the decision aid by identifying as many policy decision factors as possible and other features of methodological guidance deemed to be desirable in the literatures of all relevant disciplines. The first of two focus groups will then seek to marry these findings with focus group members' own experience and expertise in public sector population-based health policy making and screening decisions. The second focus group will examine issues surrounding the application of the decision aid and act as a sounding board for initial feedback and refinement of the draft decision aid. Finally, the Delphi method will be used to further inform and <b>refine</b> the decision <b>aid</b> with a larger audience of potential end-users. Discussion The product of this research will be a working version of a decision aid to support policy makers in population-based health policy decisions. The decision aid will address the need for more structured and systematic ways of incorporating various evidentiary sources where applicable. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} isobaric reactor {{model is}} used to simulate hydrogen isotope exchange processes taking place during flow through a powdered palladium bed. This simple model is designed to serve primarily as a platform for the initial development of detailed chemical mechanisms that can then be <b>refined</b> with the <b>aid</b> of more complex reactor descriptions. The one-dimensional model {{is based on the}} Sandia in-house code TPLUG, which solves a transient set of governing equations including an overall mass balance for the gas phase, material balances for all of the gas-phase and surface species, and an ideal gas equation of state. An energy equation can also be solved if thermodynamic properties for all of the species involved are known. The code is coupled with the Chemkin package to facilitate the incorporation of arbitrary multistep reaction mechanisms into the simulations. This capability is used here to test and optimize a basic mechanism describing the surface chemistry at or near the interface between the gas phase and a palladium particle. The mechanism includes reversible dissociative adsorptions of the three gas-phase species on the particle surface as well as atomic migrations between the surface and the bulk. The migration steps are more general than those used previously in that they do not require simultaneous movement of two atoms in opposite directions; this makes possible the creation and destruction of bulk vacancies and thus allows the model to account for variations in the bulk stoichiometry with isotopic composition. The optimization code APPSPACK {{is used to}} adjust the mass-action rate constants so as to achieve the best possible fit to a given set of experimental data, subject to a set of rigorous thermodynamic constraints. When data for nearly isothermal and isobaric deuterium-to-hydrogen (D {yields} H) and hydrogen-to-deuterium (H {yields} D) exchanges are fitted simultaneously, results for the former are excellent, while those for the latter show pronounced deviations at long times. These discrepancies can be overcome by postulating the presence of a surface poison such as carbon monoxide, but this explanation is highly speculative. When the method is applied to D {yields} H exchanges intentionally poisoned by known amounts of CO, the fitting results are noticeably degraded from those for the nominally CO-free system but are still tolerable. When TPLUG is used to simulate a blowdown-type experiment, which is characterized by large and rapid changes in both pressure and temperature, discrepancies are even more apparent. Thus, it can be concluded that the best use of TPLUG is not in simulating realistic exchange scenarios, but in extracting preliminary estimates for the kinetic parameters from experiments in which variations in temperature and pressure are intentionally minimized...|$|R

A questionnaire containing forty-five items was developed and <b>refined</b> with the <b>aid</b> of the Northeastern Indiana School Study Council serving as the pilot study group. A questionnaire was sent to all 289 superintendents of public school corporations in Indiana. Two hundred five, or 71 per cent of the superintendents replied to the questionnaire. The data were analyzed and reported as raw numbers, percentages, and totals. Major findings included: 1. Approximately 51 per cent of the superintendents indicated the present educational services available to all three, four, and five year old children were not adequate in the school districts represented. 2. Approximately 80 per cent of the schools did not provide educational programs for adults relating to the role of the parent. 3. Approximately 78 per cent of the superintendents strongly agreed the early childhood programs should have been concerned about all aspects of a young child's development. 4. Over 95 per cent of the responding superintendents indicated strong agreement or agreement that the family had the primary responsibility and the rest of society had a supplemental responsibility for providing adequate health, education, and care of young children. 5. Approximately 64 per cent of the respondents strongly agreed or agreed that teaching people ways to be better parents was an educational need in the community. 6. Approximately 63 per cent of the superintendents disagreed that day care and nursery school programs in the community might have been best provided by the public school. 7. Approximately 97 per cent of the superintendents strongly agreed or agreed the availability of revenue for financing programs for young children was limited. 8. Approximately 87 per cent of the superintendents expressed agreement that an enriched experience in a planned educational program was important to a young child's development. 9. A total of approximately 63 per cent of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed early childhood services could be effective when delivered through the public school system. 10. Approximately 57 per cent of the responding superintendents disagreed or strongly disagreed that the nursery school for three and four year old children should have been operated as an integral part of elementary education in the public schools. Conclusions were: 1. Early childhood programs, outside the home, were a need in the State of Indiana. Kindergarten programs were not available for all five year old children. The educational needs for all three, four, and five year old children were not being adequately met. 2. A program teaching high school students and adults how to be competent parents was a need in the State of Indiana. A t the same time competency as a parent was judged to be an important element for the provision of meaningful experience in a young child's life. 3. Approximately 75 per cent of the superintendent's attitudes and judgments concerning the philosophy of early childhood development was in agreement with the review of research and related literature. 4. Superintendents expressed agreement that a Planned educational program was important in a young child's development and the public schools could effectively deliver the early childhood services.

40|$|Titanium and its alloys {{have long}} been in the focus of {{biomedical}} research {{as some of the}} most suitable materials for implant production. This fact is attributed to an excellent combination of mechanical, biological and physico-chemical properties, such as low density and high mechanical strength, resulting in the highest specific strength among most common implant materials, reduced elastic modulus (compared to stainless steel or CoCrMo alloys), excellent corrosion resistance, and enhanced biocompatibility. Recently, titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V, the most common titanium implant material so far, was in the focus of several studies that claimed it has a potential to be toxic to humans due to the release of aluminium and vanadium ions in the surrounding tissues when placed within the host. This problem can be overcome by using titanium with lower alloying content, for example, commercially pure (CP) titanium, such as Grade 2 or Grade 4. Unfortunately, CP titanium shows significant decrease in mechanical properties compared to Ti 6 Al 4 V. There are ways, however, to enhance the strength of materials without altering their chemical composition. Particularly, severe plastic deformation (SPD) has been shown to dramatically enhance the strength of various materials while retaining good ductility. It is well known that the surface of medical implants plays {{a crucial role in the}} success and outcome of the surgery and determines the longevity of implants. Therefore, it is common to modify the surface of these devices in order to increase the surface area, alter its chemistry or wettability. There are numerous techniques available nowadays that allow modification of implant surface, however, only a handful of them were implemented in industry. One of such processes - SLA (Shot-blasted with Large grit and Acid etching) - is considered one of the most promising since it has been adopted by several different companies around the world. The main aim of the present work was to use SPD to increase the strength of CP titanium of two purity grades - Grade 2 and Grade 4 – in order to develop a material that, as a result of a combination of high strength and good biocompatibility, could be used to replace Ti 6 Al 4 V as a major titanium-based material on the market. Moreover, we performed all experiments on samples with two distinctly different types of surfaces – polished and SLA-treated – to highlight the effect of grain refinement on the outcome of subsequent surface modification. To the best of our knowledge, no work examining a combined effect of grain refinement and surface modification on mechanical and biological properties has been previously described in the literature. The results discussed in this thesis suggest that, as a result of a significant refinement of microstructure by SPD processing, mechanical properties of CP titanium can match (fatigue) or even exceed (tensile) those of Ti 6 Al 4 V. It was observed that SLA treatment results in the formation of a surface layer with <b>refined</b> structure which <b>aided</b> in enhancing fatigue properties of as-received titanium after surface modification. Although such layer was not found in case of SPD-processed samples, which led to a slight decrease of fatigue life compared to samples with polished surface, fatigue properties of SPD-processed titanium were still superior to those of Ti 6 Al 4 V. Fatigue testing in simulated body fluid, designed to test how titanium with refined structure reacts to aggressive environment, indicated no deterioration of fatigue life of titanium, regardless of microstructure. It has been demonstrated that surface properties of titanium were notably influenced by the grain size and the subsequent SLA treatment. Roughness of polished samples was shown to be a function of the grain size of material. At the same time, mechanical properties are believed to be responsible for differences in roughness of SLA-modified surface, as surface roughening primarily occurs by means of grit-blasting with its effect highly dependent on the strength/ductility of the surface. Wettability of titanium has been observed to be determined by the surface texture, being a product of variations in the processing route. This effect retained after severe surface roughening as well, although, overall, surface of SLA-treated titanium samples were found to be much more hydrophobic. Simultaneously, variations in wettability between samples of different conditions became less pronounced. Chemical analysis of CP Ti with varying microstructure and surface quality revealed no effect of microstructure on the chemical state of the polished surface. At the same time, it was noted that SLA treatment of ultrafine-grained titanium may favour the formation of a thicker, more chemically uniform oxide layer. Finally, an assessment of biological properties of CP Ti has been made. The results indicate a positive effect of ultrafine-grained structure and associated surface properties on the attachment, proliferation and differentiation of two types of tissue cells – human osteosarcoma SaOS- 2 cells and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (adMSC) on both types of surfaces. At the same time, bacterial adhesion was also significantly enhanced on the surface of SLA-treated titanium. This fact suggests that an utilisation of surface modification techniques in industrial processes of implant production should be most carefully controlled in order to reduce possibility of serious complication that may be caused by bacterial colonisation. Overall, experimental results presented in this thesis indicate that SPD, especially in combination with surface modification techniques, such as SLA treatment, has a great potential to improve both mechanical and biological properties of commercially pure titanium to make it a highly favourable and competitive candidate for the replacement of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy. Our research suggests that there may be only one potential drawback of a combination of SPD and SLA, namely, enhanced adhesion of bacterial cells on the surface of such materials. However, this negative effect is not attributed to SPD processing, but rather to the increased surface roughness inherent to the SLA treatment. We suggest that this issue can be addressed by developing proper handling, storage and pre-implantation preparation protocols, a process that was not covered in current work but could be included as a part of the basis for the future work...|$|R
