2500|$|In April 2016, a {{week before}} his film Julieta was to be {{released}} in Spain, Pedro and Agustín Almodóvar were listed in the leak of the Panama Papers from the database of the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca; their names showing up on the incorporation documents of a company based in the British Virgin Islands between 1991 and 1994. As a result, Pedro cancelled scheduled press, interviews and photocalls he had made for the release of Julieta in Spain. Agustín released a statement in which he declared himself fully responsible, saying that he has always taken charge of financial matters while Pedro has been dedicated to the creative side and hoping that this would not tarnish his brother's reputation. He also stressed that the brothers have always abided by Spanish tax laws. [...] "On the legal front there are no worries", he explained. [...] "It's a reputation problem which I'm responsible for.

The week after the release of Julieta, Pedro gave an interview in which he stated that he knew nothing about the shares as financial matters were handled by his brother, Agustín. However, he emphasised that his ignorance was not an excuse and took full responsibility. Agustín later admitted that he believed Julietas box office earnings in Spain suffered as a result, as the film reportedly had the worst opening of an Almodóvar film at the Spanish box office in 20 years.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{obstacles}} {{written for}} the pair included the opposition of Colleen's family to the pairing, J.T.'s music career, and third party characters who came between them. In 2003, J.T. cheated on Colleen with Anita Hodges, an older woman considered a [...] "sexy cougar". Luckinbill explained J.T. as being [...] "weak in a desperate moment", and that he [...] "felt <b>really</b> <b>sorry</b> for someone he's known his whole life, and the good side of J.T. emerged to offer Anita some comfort.

[...] "wouldn't hurt her for the world, and yet {{that is exactly what}} he'll end up doing". In May 2004, Fonseca's contract was not renewed and she was confirmed to exit. Within the storyline, Colleen leaves Genoa City and J.T. because she does not want to {{stand in the way of}} his music career. However, she returned to reprise the role briefly that December. [...] J.T. had begun dating Brittany Hodges (Lauren Woodland) and the writers wanted to bring Colleen back to [...] "add more complications to the story". Luckinbill described his character's feelings for Colleen and Brittany as extremely different, saying: [...] "J.T. saw Colleen as somebody so opposite himself that he considered himself undeserving of her love. She was too angelic [...] Brittany has more of the 'black sheep' in her." [...] Fans of the pair campaigned for a reunion between J.T. and Colleen when Fonseca returned, and pushed for her to be put back on contract. Fonseca and Luckinbill also anticipated the repairing of their characters because of a positive viewer response. Fonseca described it as being [...] "the best part of coming back", stating: [...] "Already it seems the fans [...] excited to see us together again." [...] Luckinbill stated: [...] "When they were together, they were like some sort of supercouple and there is a huge amount of fans who still want them together." [...] News of Fonseca's second exit incited a fan outcry and a campaign pushing for the actress's permanent return. Fonseca made her final appearance as Colleen in February 2005.|$|E
