50|$|In packet {{switched}} networks, routing directs packet forwarding (the transit of logically addressed network packets from their source toward their ultimate destination) through intermediate nodes. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware {{devices such as}} routers, bridges, gateways, firewalls, or switches. General-purpose computers can also forward packets and perform routing, though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from limited performance. The <b>routing</b> <b>process</b> usually directs forwarding {{on the basis of}} routing tables, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations.

50|$|The router {{will usually}} compare {{administrative}} distances {{to determine which}} protocol has the lowest value. The router prefers protocols that have a lower assigned administrative distance. For example, OSPF has a default distance of 110, so it is preferred by the router process, over RIP, which has a default distance of 120. The administrator can arbitrarily reconfigure the administrative distances, which affects the ranking of the preferred routes by the <b>routing</b> <b>process.</b> On Cisco routers, static routes have an administrative distance of 1, making them preferred over routes issued by a dynamic routing protocol. The administrative distance is a value that is always only referenced by the local router itself. The administrative distance is not advertised on the network.|$|E

A greedy embedding is an embedding of the given graph with the property that a failure of this type is impossible.

First, a fault model called faulty block is used in which all faulty nodes in the system are contained in a set of disjoint faulty blocks. Then, the information of faulty block needs to be distributed to a limited number of nodes at the boundaries of faulty block to avoid a message entering a detour area. When new faults occur, faulty blocks need to be reconstructed and their fault information needs to be redistributed. In this case, the update of fault information and the <b>routing</b> <b>process</b> proceed hand-in-hand.

40|$|Floods cause {{environmental}} hazards and influence on socio-economic activities. In this study, we evaluated the historic flood frequency at a confluence {{in the middle}} Yellow River, China. A non-parametric, multivariate, empirical, orthogonal function matrix model, which consists of time correlation coefficients of flood discharge at different gauge stations and flood events {{was used for the}} analysis of flood frequency. The model addresses the characteristics of confluent floods such as frequency and the probability in multiple tributary rivers. Flood frequency analysis is often coupled with studies of hydrological <b>routing</b> <b>processes</b> that reduce the flood capacity of the rivers. Flood routing to the confluence were simulated using kinematic wave theory. Results of this flood frequency analysis showed that flooding frequency has intensified in the past 500 years, especially during the 19 th century. Flooding in streams above the confluence was more frequent than in streams below the confluence. Over the last 2000 years, concurrent flooding in multiple tributary rivers accounted for 67. 5 % of the total flooding in the middle Yellow River. Simulation of flood <b>routing</b> <b>processes</b> shows that the decreased flooding capacity and elevated river bed of the shrunken main channel leads to an increased flood wave propagation time (24 – 52. 3 h) in the study area after 1995. The model indicates that human activities, such as constructions of the Sanmenxia Dam, have changed flood routing boundary conditions and have contributed to the increased flood frequency at the confluence.
