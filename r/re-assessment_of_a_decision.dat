Unlike earlier studies this book focuses on the use made of animals in debates about reason in the period 1558 - 1700, {{and looks at the}} impact Descartes' ‘beast-machine' hypothesis has had on the writing of history in the west. As such this monograph is <b>a</b> development <b>of</b> EF's earlier book, Perceiving Animals: Humans and Beasts in Early Modern English Culture (Palgrave, 2000), and of her consideration of the nature <b>of</b> <b>an</b> animal historiography in ‘A Left-Handed Blow' (output no. 3) ...|$|R

40|$|The proper {{characterization}} of coastal aquifers requires modeling variable density flow effects. However, most models estimate processes as saline intrusion based on 2 D models with constant density and are rarely calibrated to honor salinity measurements. These facts limit the model predictions reliability, affecting the estimated hydrodynamic parameters, external stresses, and other model outputs {{that can be}} critical for planning or management decisions. This paper de-scribes the <b>re-assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coastal aquifer model (Oropesa-Torreblanca, eastern Spain) sub-jected to moderate-to-high saline intrusion with a transient 3 D variable density flow model. Pre-vious models were based on 2 D low-resolution grids without variable density effects. The new model honors the observed trends of both piezometric and salinity data. Results show the impor-tance of the variable density effects having on critical outputs as sea intrusion and the discharges to <b>a</b> local wetland <b>of</b> high environmental value. The widespread intrusion process and its current stabilization are confirmed but, compared to previous models, the annual average intrusion is 156 % higher, discharge to the wetland increases 30 %, and the inflows from neighboring formations in...|$|R
40|$|The paper explores firms {{as complex}} anticipatory systems which {{construct}} dynamic strategic configurations based on anticipation {{of their future}} possible states within the competitive environment. We argue that firm’s performance depends on (a) its strategy making process based on anticipation, and (b) its managerial capabilities which effectuate the anticipatory process in the following four stages: search across anticipated “what-if” resource configurations, the articulation and conversion of their meaning, and the finding and evolution of strategic patterns and courses of action for environmental fit. We performed an in-depth exploratory study with <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> senior managers in a pharmaceutical firm to uncover diverse anticipatory capabilities. The study {{was based on the}} development and <b>re-assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> product market strategy for a new drug launch without and with the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simulation-based learning environment. The results show the existence of heterogeneous anticipatory process, which we name search-articulate-find-evolve of alternative resource configuration sets, determining the managerial dynamic capabilities related particularly to managerial cognition and decision making. We propose anticipation enhanced by modelling and simulation can improve managers’ mental processes and help them to overcome cognitive limitations when dealing with real-world complexities. ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{analyses}} the neologisms 2014 as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> {{the changes}} in social life and enlarged the Russian language vocabulary. The presented words and the word combinations are characterized {{from the point of}} view of the existing word-building patterns. Especial attention is given to new abbreviations as well as to the abridged words, their etymology and the ways of building new neologisms on the basis of the existing words: Euromaidan – antymaidan – automaidan. The author also emphasizes the neologisms, that appeared as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> changes in semantics by means of splitting and transition to homonymy. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> example <b>of</b> such semantic changes the author shows not only single words but also word combinations such as “green little people”, “polite people” and “titushko” – a surname that became a common noun. Due to the popularity and social significance the neologisms of the year 2014 take the leading positions in the national contests “word of the year”. They influence the <b>re-assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> neutral notion making it either positive or negative and over the background of political confrontation during the year 2014 have transformed into the “words of hate”...|$|R

Unimprovable upper and close to unimprovable lower bounds on the minimal depth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> tree are obtained. 1 Introduction Decision trees and decision rule systems are widely used in different applications as algorithms and as <b>a</b> form <b>of</b> knowledge representation. Problems of comparative analysis of decision trees and decision rule systems are interesting both for theory and for practice [2, 6]. In this paper we consider relationships between parameters <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> rule {{system and the}} minimal depth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> tree which solves the problem of the search of all realizable rules from the system. The necessity to find all realizable rules arises, for example, if we consider problems which can have simultaneously many decisions, and the number of realizable rules with the same decision cha [...] ...|$|R
