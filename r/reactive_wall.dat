These systems often are used as a polishing step to groundwater treatment in conjunction with source removal and natural attenuation. In constructing <b>reactive</b> <b>wall</b> groundwater treatment systems, various specialty construction techniques have been utilized.

40|$|A {{complete}} thermodynamic {{analysis of}} a <b>reactive</b> dividing <b>wall</b> distillation column and an equilibrium reactor followed by a dividing wall distillation column was conducted for several equilibrium reactions using data of a real pilot plant for the distillation column. In addition, several aspects related to the hydrodynamic behavior of the implemented <b>reactive</b> dividing <b>wall</b> distillation column were analyzed {{in order to prevent}} operation problems with regard to hydraulics. Results indicate that the <b>reactive</b> dividing <b>wall</b> column presented both higher thermodynamic efficiencies and lower exergy losses than those obtained in the classical configurations of a reactor plus a distillation column. The <b>reactive</b> dividing <b>wall</b> distillation column also required lower energy consumption compared to that required by classical processes. These facts confirm the higher energy efficiency of <b>reactive</b> dividing <b>wall</b> designs. Results also indicate that the <b>reactive</b> dividing <b>wall</b> column meets process intensification goals: i) it requires lower energy consumption, which can be translated into lower carbon dioxide emissions, and ii) the reduction in energy consumption can be associated with lower traffic of liquid in the column and reduction in column diameter (miniaturization). Finally, it was observed that proper collection of the liquid in a side tank and an adequate split to both sides of the dividing wall {{play an important role in}} hydraulics. The manipulation of this split enables minimum energy consumption and high thermodynamic efficiency. 1...|$|R

If a divided wall column and a reactive distillation are integrated, they {{leads to a}} higher integrated process is a <b>reactive</b> divided <b>wall</b> column. However <b>reactive</b> divided <b>wall</b> column has still a new research area. First of all, the thesis proposed a procedure for design of divided wall column, which based on the FUGK model. Both technological and hydrodynamic aspects in the divided wall column are considered in the procedure. Design parameters are then provided to the rigorous simulation and optimization in the ProSimplus software. In order to test this procedure, both ideal and non-ideal ternary mixtures are chosen to be separated in a divided wall column. The {{results show that the}} procedure can determine parameters quickly in the case studies and can give a good initialization for rigorous simulation. Secondly, a pilot plant has been design, built and operated in our laboratory (LGC, Toulouse, France, 2013). The pilot plant will provide necessary experimental evidence to validate the previous procedure. Ternary mixture and four-component mixture of alcohols have been used in our pilot plant in steady state conditions. The results show that the composition of products, composition and temperature profile along the column are in very good agreement with simulation results.

The relevance of this simplified approach is assessed through a specific case (given bubble shape, channel diameter and fluid flow rates), and hydrodynamics as well as mass transfer results are successfully compared to previously published numerical, semi-analytical and experimental works. Influence of unit cell length and of catalytic surface reaction rate is thoroughly investigated. Inferred overall mass transfer coefficients are found to increase with bubble frequency and resulting higher interfacial area in unit cell and intensified recirculation in slug. Film contribution to mass transfer is proved dominant {{in the case of}} short bubbles with <b>reactive</b> <b>wall,</b> and hardly varies with reaction rate.

40|$|This is a {{study on}} the mass transport, {{accomplished}} by reaction, advection, and dispersion, of a solute in steady Poiseuille flow through a circular tube with a <b>reactive</b> <b>wall</b> layer. The reaction consists of a reversible component due to phase exchange between the flowing fluid and the wall layer and an irreversible component due to absorption into the wall. First, the generalized dispersion model is employed to deduce asymptotic steady-state values of the first three transport coefficients in terms of the strengths and kinetics of the two reactions, which can be of any magnitude. Second, a numerical simulation is performed to examine the time development of the fluid- and wall-phase concentration profiles starting from the initial release of the solute into the tube. The analytical deduction brings out not only results relevant to the asymptotic state when the transport coefficients become independent of time but also criteria {{that can be used to}} estimate the significance of the asymptotic steady state in the whole course of mass transport. The numerical simulation generates time-developing concentration profiles that can be used to explain some paradoxical behaviors exhibited by the transport coefficients under certain conditions.

40|$|Groundwater {{remediation}} {{has become}} increasingly necessary for environmental sustainability in industrial, agricultural and urban settings. One reason for this need has been the emplacement of rock waste materials (e. g. coal washery discard (CWD) and blast furnace slag (BFS)) from mining and metallurgical industries {{in areas such as}} the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Since there has been a lack of rigorous research into the potential for these emplacements to pollute groundwater, the majority of these emplacements were constructed without the installation of engineering leachate controls. Indeed, until research over the last 15 to 20 years proved the contrary, available evidence suggested that these rock wastes were inert and would not threaten groundwater quality. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} identify the environmental impacts of these rock waste emplacements and develop groundwater remediation strategies at existing emplacement sites, as well as develop economically and environmentally sustainable utilisation technologies for these rock waste materials. This thesis presents a field study of a BFS emplacement located within the Illawarra region of New South Wales. High pH groundwater (pH 12 - 13) has been found to be migrating from this emplacement into an adjacent coastal saline lake, resulting in severe impacts on fish and benthic fauna. An innovative engineering solution, which involves the installation of a low pyrite CWD permeable <b>reactive</b> <b>wall</b> at the site, has been proposed and tested. Depending on the particle size, the equilibrium pH of this CWD material ranges from about 7. 5 to over 9. 0. Field monitoring has been conducted to assess the hydraulic performance and reactivity of the CWD wall. A consistent and significant pH drop across the wall has been observed; the pH at the effluent end of the wall averaged 7. 2 over the 825 day monitoring period. In addition, the wall was not found to impede natural groundwater flow. A three-dimensional MODFLOW model of the site and the wall reveals that flow through the wall conforms to fundamental flow equations. Laboratory batch and column tests have been conducted to develop a conceptual model of the chemical interactions within the CWD wall. According to this model, the primary pH reduction mechanism is the deprotonation of reactive amphoteric oxygen sites at the clay edge surfaces and gibbsite basal surfaces within the CWD. This is an acid-base controlled reaction in which protons are drawn into solution by the concentration of hydroxide ions. Deprotonation of clay surfaces results in negatively charged surfaces that attract and adsorb available cations (primarily calcium) from solution. The conceptual model has been used to develop a quantitative PHREEQC geochemical model of the wall. This model has been thoroughly tested using column test data and found to be valid. It is used to show that exhausted CWD is chemically stable and that the worst-case reactive life of the CWD permeable <b>reactive</b> <b>wall</b> at the BFS emplacement site will be 3. 23 years. Under average rainfall conditions, the life of the wall should exceed 60 years. This solution is shown to be an efficient and economical engineering application of clay surface chemistry. It simultaneously addresses three issues relevant to groundwater remediation: the need for groundwater remediation strategies at existing rock waste emplacements, the need to develop economical and environmentally sustainable utilisation technologies for rock waste and the need for new field applications for permeable reactive walls...|$|E
40|$|Hot wire {{chemical}} vapor deposition (HWCVD) is {{a powerful}} technology for deposition of high quality films on large area, where drawbacks of plasma based technology such as defect generation by ion bombardment and high equipment costs are omitted. While processes for diamond coatings using H 2 and CH 4 as precursor have been investigated in detail since 1990 and have been transferred to industry, research also focuses on silicon based coatings with H 2, SiH 4 and NH 3 as process gases. HWCVD of silicon based coatings is a promising alternative for state-of-the-art radiofrequency-plasma enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} reactors. The film formation in HWCVD results from an interaction of several concurrent chemical reactions such as gas phase chemistry, film deposition, abstraction of surplus hydrogen bonds and etching by atomic hydrogen. Since {{there is no easy}} relation between process parameters and resulting deposition profiles, substantial experimental effort is required to optimize the process for a given film specification and the desired film uniformity. In order to obtain {{a deeper understanding of the}} underlying mechanisms and to enable an efficient way of process optimization, simulation methods come into play. While diamond deposition occurs at pressures in the range of several kPa HWCVD deposition of Si based coatings operates at pressures in the 0. 1 â 30 Pa range. In this pressure regime, particle based simulation methods focused on solving the Boltzmann equation are computationally feasible. In comparison to computational fluid dynamics this yields improved accuracy even near small gaps or orifices, where characteristic geometric dimensions approach the order of the mean free path of gas molecules. At Fraunhofer IST, a parallel implementation of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method extended by a <b>reactive</b> <b>wall</b> chemistry model is developed.

Expression of this epitope, recognized by the mAb JIM 8, is regulated during initiation, proliferation, and prolonged growth of suspension cultures such that changes in the abundance of JIM 8 -reactive cells always precede equivalent changes in embryogenic potential. Therefore, a direct correlation exists between {{the presence of the}} JIM 8 -reactive cell wall epitope and somatic embryo formation. The JIM 8 -reactive cell wall epitope is expressed in the cell walls of three types of single cells and one type of cell cluster. One of the single cell types seems able to follow one of two phytohormone- controlled developmental pathways, either a cell elongation pathway that eventually leads to cell death, or a cell division pathway that gives rise to proembryogenic masses. We demonstrate that all JIM 8 - reactive cell types in embryogenic carrot suspension cultures are developmentally related, and that the switch by one of them to somatic embryogenesis is accompanied by the immediate dissipation of the JIM 8 - <b>reactive</b> cell <b>wall</b> epitope. The cell wall carbohydrate epitope recognized by JIM 8 therefore represents a cell wall marker for a very early transitional cell state in the developmental pathway to carrot somatic embryogenesis...|$|R

40|$|In {{turbulence}} {{research and}} flow applications, turbulence models like RaNS (Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes) models and LES (Large Eddy Simulation) are used. Both models filter the governing flow equations. Thus a scale separation approach is introduced for modeling purposes {{with the large}} scales simulated using a numerical scheme while smaller scales {{are assumed to be}} less important and might be modeled more or less easily. Unfortunately small scales are frequently of big importance, e. g. in <b>reactive</b> flows, <b>wall</b> bounded flows, or flows with significant Prandtl or Schmidt number effects. Recent alternatives to these standard models are the class of models based on the one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) idea, like ODTLES. The ability of ODT to capture highly turbulent flows (recently up to Re_Ï = 6 Ã 10 ^ 5) allows ODTLES to realize 3 D resolutions basically independent of the turbulent intensity. In two papers we provide a formal theory and application of an innovative modeling strategy for highly turbulent flows in domains of moderate complexity: In part I (see Glawe et al. (2015)) a new general filtering approach, called XLES (extended LES), is introduced. Contrary to LES, XLES is based on 2 D filtering of the governing equations, whereby additional small scale terms are interpreted numerically. In this work a new ansatz for the ODTLES model is introduced as one special approach in the XLES family of models by incorporating the ODT model into XLES. The ODT model introduces microstructures not captured by the XLES filtered equations. To illustrate the ODTLES model capabilities, turbulent channel and duct flows up to friction Reynolds number Re_Ï = 10000 are studied...|$|R
40|$|The cell surface {{reactivity}} of the cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. strain KC 97, an isolate from the Krisuvik hot spring, Iceland, {{was investigated in}} terms of its proton binding behavior and charge characteristics by using acid-base titrations, electrophoretic mobility analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. Analysis of titration data with the linear programming optimization method showed that intact filaments were dominated by surface proton binding sites inferred to be carboxyl groups (acid dissociation constants [pKa] between 5. 0 and 6. 2) and amine groups (mean pKa of 8. 9). Sheath material isolated by using lysozyme and sodium dodecyl sulfate generated pKa spectra similarly dominated by carboxyls (pKa of 4. 6 to 6. 1) and amines (pKa of 8. 1 to 9. 2). In both intact filaments and isolated sheath material, the lower ligand concentrations at mid-pKa values were ascribed to phosphoryl groups. Whole filaments and isolated sheath material displayed total reactive-site densities of 80. 3 Ã 10 â 5 and 12. 3 Ã 10 â 5 mol/g (dry mass) of cyanobacteria, respectively, implying that much of the surface {{reactivity of}} this microorganism is located on the cell wall and not the sheath. This is corroborated by electrophoretic mobility measurements that showed that the sheath has a net neutral charge at mid-pHs. In contrast, unsheathed cells exhibited a stronger negative-charge characteristic. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy analysis of ultrathin sections stained with heavy metals further demonstrated that most of the reactive binding sites are located upon the cell wall. Thus, the cell surface reactivity of Calothrix sp. strain KC 97 can be described as a dual layer composed of a highly <b>reactive</b> cell <b>wall</b> enclosed within a poorly reactive sheath...|$|R

However, our detailed understanding of the spatial and temporal relationship between normal faulting and salt movement is poor {{due to a lack}} of natural examples constraining their geometric and kinematic relationship in three-dimensions. To improve our understanding of these processes we here use 3 D seismic reflection and borehole data from the Egersund Basin, offshore Norway to determine the structure and growth of a normal fault array formed during the birth, growth and decay of an array of salt structures.

This study focuses on the potential of using dredged sediments as vertical cut-off wall backfill material. Materials used as vertical cut-off wall material are expected to have low hydraulic permeability and good workable characteristics. The Baltimore Harbor dredged sediments used for this study were plastic in nature and finer than the commonly encountered wall materials, and a research study was needed to evaluate their beneficial reuse in such an application. The objective {{of this study was to}} find an appropriate mix of sediment and bentonite that will be able to function as a vertical cut-off wall backfill material. The preliminary tests on the bentonite were carried out for screening purposes and to find an appropriate water content that will satisfy the desired viscosity range. Bentonite was then added to the dredged sediment in ratios of 1 %, 2 % and 3 % of the total dredged sediment weight. The preliminary tests were repeated for each of these mixes to determine applicable trends and at what percentages of bentonite, the viscosity of the mixture was still in the workable range. The 1 % bentonite mix was additionally modified with the addition of 5 % and 8 % fly ash by weight. These mixtures were then subjected to API filter press tests to determine the effect these mixes would have on the hydraulic conductivity. Adsorption testing was also carried out on the dredged sediment and all the mixes to determine their adsorption capacities to see if they can potentially be employed in <b>reactive</b> cut-off <b>wall</b> applications. The results show that a suitable moisture content and viscosity of the dredged sediments can be obtained that makes it usable in the mix design. Increased bentonite content, to the percent tested (3 %), lead to a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity and increased fly ash content, to the percent tested (8 %), lead to an increase in the hydraulic conductivity. For the metals tested, an increased bentonite content enhanced the adsorption capacity of the mix and an increased fly ash content diminished the adsorption capacity of the mix. With the appropriate mix design, dredged sediments can serve as an effective inhibitor to the flow of ground water and hence serve as an in-situ containment and remediation system...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMarine-freshwater and freshwater-marine {{transitions}} {{have been}} key {{events in the}} evolution of life, and most major groups of organisms have independently undergone such events at least once in their history. Here we first compile an inventory of bidirectional freshwater and marine transitions in multicellular photosynthetic eukaryotes. While green and red algae have mastered multiple transitions in both directions, brown algae have colonized fresh water on a maximum of six known occasions, and angiosperms have made the transition to marine environments only two or three times. Next we review the early evolutionary events leading to the colonization of current habitats. It is commonly assumed that the conquest of land proceeded in a sequence from marine to freshwater habitats. However, recent evidence suggests that early photosynthetic eukaryotes may have arisen in subaerial or freshwater environments and only later colonized marine environments as hypersaline oceans were diluted to the contemporary level. Although this hypothesis remains speculative, {{it is important to keep}} these alternative scenarios in mind when interpreting the current habitat distribution of plants and algae. Finally we discuss the roles of structural and functional adaptations of the cell <b>wall,</b> <b>reactive</b> oxygen species scavengers, osmoregulation, and reproduction. These are central for acclimatization to freshwater or to marine environments. We observe that successful transitions appear to have occurred more frequently in morphologically simple forms and conclude that, in addition to physiological studies of euryhaline species, comparative studies of closely related species fully adapted to one or the other environment are necessary to better understand the adaptive processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{mouths of}} three human infants were {{examined}} {{from birth to}} age 2 years to detect colonization of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2. These bacteria did not colonize until after tooth eruption. The diversity of posteruption isolates was determined by ribotyping. Using immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we determined the reactivity of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) antibodies in saliva samples collected from each infant before and after colonization against cell wall proteins from their own A. naeslundii strains and carbohydrates from standard A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 strains. A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 carbohydrate-reactive SIgA antibodies were not detected in any saliva sample. However, SIgA antibodies <b>reactive</b> with cell <b>wall</b> proteins were present in saliva before these bacteria colonized the mouth. These antibodies could be almost completely removed by absorption with A. odontolyticus, a species known to colonize the human mouth shortly after birth. However, after colonization by A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2, specific antibodies were induced {{that could not be}} removed by absorption with A. odontolyticus. Cluster analysis of the patterns of reactivity of postcolonization salivary antibodies from each infant with antigens from their own strains showed that not only could these antibodies discriminate among strains but antibodies in saliva samples collected at different times showed different reactivity patterns. Overall, these data suggest that, although much of the salivary SIgA antibodies reactive with A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 are directed against genus-specific or more broadly cross-reactive antigens, species, genospecies, and possibly strain-specific antibodies are induced in response to colonization...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{experiments}} was to evaluate the role of circulating antibodies in the rejection of human renal allografts and to study the apparent target(s) for antibody binding. Eluates obtained from surgical biopsy and nephrectomy specimens of rejecting, cadaveric human renal allografts were tested for antibodies directed to structural antigens of normal kidney and for cytotoxic antibody activity against mononuclear cell populations. By indirect immunofluorescence 23 of 35 eluates contained immunoglobulin that bound to normal kidney. Staining was in smooth muscle only in 10 patients, in smooth muscle and other structures such as tubular basement membranes, proximal cells, or brush border in 9 patients, and in structures other than smooth muscle in 4 patients. All 16 eluates tested contained antibodies cytotoxic for cells derived from a panel of normal volunteers. Six were cytotoxic to T cells and 10 to B cell and monocyte-enriched preparations. Absorption of eluates with pooled buffy coat cells, platelet concentrates and packed, cultured B cells removed antibodies <b>reactive</b> with vascular <b>wall</b> smooth muscle and endothelium, but not antibodies to tubular basement membranes, proximal or distal tubular cells, brush border, or other structures of kidney sections. Two of five eluates containing antikidney antibodies were found to bind to rat kidneys in vivo. These results suggest that circulating antibodies participate in cadaveric renal allograft destruction and demonstrate that they can be recovered directly from the allograft. Moreover, the data indicate that there are different antibody populations involved: some clearly directed to allo-specific differences and others that are apparently kidney-specific...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: HDLs have {{antiinflammatory}} and antioxidant {{properties in}} vitro. This study investigates these properties in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Chow-fed, normocholesterolemic New Zealand White rabbits received a daily infusion of (1) saline, (2) reconstituted HDL (rHDL) containing 25 mg apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and 50 mg of either 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -linoleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PLPC) or 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), (3) 25 mg lipid-free apoA-I, or (4) 50 mg of either PLPC-small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) or DPPC-SUVs {{on each of}} 3 consecutive days. Nonocclusive carotid periarterial collars were implanted after the second dose of treatment. Forty-eight hours after insertion of the collars, the arteries were removed and analyzed {{for the presence of}} reactive oxygen species, the infiltration of neutrophils, and the expression of adhesion proteins and chemokines. Insertion of the periarterial collar induced a 4. 1 -fold increase in presence of vascular <b>wall</b> <b>reactive</b> oxygen species. This effect was completely abolished in the animals infused with rHDL. The periarterial collar was associated with a dense infiltration of the arterial wall by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This infiltration was inhibited by 73 % to 94 % in the animals infused with rHDL, by 75 % in the animals infused with lipid-free apoA-I, and by 51 % to 65 % in animals infused with SUVs. There {{were no significant differences between}} the effects of PLPC and DPPC in either the rHDL or SUVs. Endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 was also increased by the collar insertion and inhibited by rHDL, lipid-free apoA-I, and, to a lesser extent, also by the SUVs. CONCLUSIONS: Infusion of rHDL, apoA-I, and phospholipid-SUVs inhibits the early pro-oxidant and proinflammatory changes induced by a periarterial collar in normocholesterolemic rabbits. Stephen J.
