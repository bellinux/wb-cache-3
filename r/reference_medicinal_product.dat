40|$|According to the European Medicine Agency, a “biosimilar” is a {{biological}} medicinal product that contains {{a version of the}} active substance of an original {{biological medicinal product}} (reference or innovative medicinal product) that has been authorized in the European Economic Area. The similarity to the <b>reference</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> in terms of quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy needs to be set on a comprehensive comparability basis. The generic standard approach (demonstration of bioequivalence with a <b>reference</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> by appropriate bioavailability studies), which is applicable {{to a wide range of}} chemically derived medicinal products, is not sufficient to prove the similarity of biotechnology derived products due to their structural complexity. Furthermore, these biopharmaceuticals products, in comparison with the conventional ones, show a greater ability to activate the immune response. The evaluation of biosimilar medicines for authorisation purposes by the European Medicine Agency does not include recommendations on whether a biosimilar should be used interchangeably with its reference medicine. Substitution policies are, therefore, within the remit of the EU member states. In order to support pharmacovigilance monitoring, all appropriate measures should be taken to clearly identify any biological medicinal product with due regard to its brand name and batch number.

The generic drug of a <b>reference</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> defines itself as a drug having the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active ingredients, the same dosage form and the bioequivalence with this <b>reference</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> was demonstrated by appropriate studies of bioavailability. It is the right to switch granted to the pharmacists in 1999 that is at the origin of the real development of these specialties on the French pharmaceutical market. Nevertheless, about 10 years later, it seems that the system in place does not offer all the necessary securities with regard to pharmacovigilance, notably for the products with narrow therapeutic margin. By strengthening and/or by completing the role played by the health care professionals and the public institutions concerned, it is highly possible to improve the robustness of the system. Also, the recent arrival in Europe of the biosimilars, similar molecules but not bioequivalent to biological products, cause an even more tricky specific situation than that of the generics because of their nature, of the difficulty to manufacture them, and of the risk of immunogenicity. If the substitution is not permitted in several European countries including France, the other issues can appear especially in case of interchangeability requiring also, the reinforcement of certain measures.

40|$|Background: Slovenia aims to {{regulate}} and reimburse prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{in order to}} manage and reduce public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Two levels of reference prices (R) are used: external R with a regulated maximum price and internal R with a maximum attributed value, defined by reference pricing for interchangeable <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia covers expenses for their prescribed use and negotiates prices. The objective of our article was to confirm the basic thesis that the price regulation system and reimbursement have caused {{the decline in the}} regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Consequently, the decline in prices might contribute to a reduction of public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Methods: The research covered 760 regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for both groups of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed on an outpatient prescription and financed by public expenditures. The Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test are used to estimate the impact of wholesale price regulation system and reimbursement on the trends in nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the period 2003 – 2010. Results: The main thesis that the nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> declined during the years 2003 – 2010, was confirmed by the Laspeyres index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test further confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences in the wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (p < 0. 05).

A science-based regulatory framework to ensure high-quality biosimilars has been established in Europe since 2005 and is monitored and updated on an ongoing basis. The guiding principle of a biosimilar development program is to establish similarity between the biosimilar and the reference medicine by the best possible means, ensuring that the previously proven safety and efficacy of the <b>reference</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> also applies to the biosimilar. Development of a biosimilar is underpinned by state-of-the-art analytical techniques to characterize both reference medicines and biosimilars. The extent and nature of the nonclinical in vivo studies and clinical studies to be performed depend on the level of evidence obtained in the previous step(s), including the robustness of the physicochemical, biological, and nonclinical in vitro data. Extrapolation is an important element of the biosimilarity concept. When biosimilar comparability has been demonstrated in one indication, extrapolation of the data package to other indications of the reference medicine could be acceptable, but needs to be scientifically justified and considered in light of the demonstrated level of sameness by all analytical, nonclinical, and clinical data. The credibility of the scientific basis behind the biosimilar concept, and quality of regulatory decision-making, is demonstrated by the successful approval and clinical use of 20 biosimilar medicines since 2006 when Omnitrope® was the first biosimilar to be approved.

Although biosimilar versions of r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) are currently on the market, given their structural complexity and manufacturing process, {{it is important to}} thoroughly evaluate them in comparison with the reference product. This evaluation should focus on how they differ (e. g., active component molecular characteristics, impurities and potency), as this could be associated with clinical outcome. This study compared the site-specific glycosylation profile and batch-to-batch variability of the in-vivo bioactivity of Bemfola, a biosimilar follitropin alfa, with its <b>reference</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> GONAL-f. The focus of this analysis was the site-specific glycosylation at asparagine (Asn) 52 of the α-subunit of FSH, owing to the pivotal role of Asn 52 glycosylation in FSH receptor (FSHR) activation/signalling. Overall, Bemfola had bulkier glycan structures and greater sialylation than GONAL-f. The nominal specific activity for both Bemfola and GONAL-f is 13, 636 IU/mg. Taking into account both the determined potency and the nominal amount the average specific activity of Bemfola was 14, 522 IU/mg (105. 6 % of the nominal value), which was greater than the average specific activity observed for GONAL-f (13, 159 IU/mg; 97. 3 % of the nominal value; p = 0. 0048), although this was within the range stated in the product label. A higher batch-to-batch variability was also observed for Bemfola versus GONAL-f (coefficient of variation: 8. 3 % vs 5. 8 %). A different glycan profile was observed at Asn 52 in Bemfola compared with GONAL-f (a lower proportion of bi-antennary structures [~ 53 % vs ~ 77 %], and a higher proportion of tri-antennary [~ 41 % vs ~ 23 %] and tetra-antennary structures [~ 5 % vs < 1 %]). These differences in the Asn 52 glycan profile might potentially lead to differences in FSHR activation. This, together with the greater bioactivity and higher batch-to-batch variability of Bemfola, could partly explain the reported differences in clinical outcomes. The clinical relevance of the differences observed between GONAL-f and Bemfola should be further investigated...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{more than}} half of the {{biotherapeutics}} are produced in mammalian cell lines as a result of correct protein folding and assembly as well as their faculty to bring about a variety of post-translational modifications. The widespread progression of biosimilars has moved the focus in mammalian cell-culture process development. Thereby, the modulation of quality attributes of recombinant therapeutic proteins has increasingly gained importance from early process development stages. Protein quality directly shapes the clinical efficacy and safety in vivo, and therefore, the control of the complex post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation (e. g. high mannose, fucosylation, galactosylation and sialylation), charge variants, aggregates and low-molecular-weight species formation, is pivotal for efficient receptor binding and for triggering the desired immune responses in patients. In the frame of biosimilar development, product quality modulation methods using the potential of the host cell line are particularly sought after to match the quality profile of the targeted <b>reference</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> (RMP) as closely as possible. The environment the cell is dwelling in directly influences its metabolism and the resulting quality profile of the expressed protein. Thereby the cell culture medium plays a central role in upstream manufacturing. In this work, concentration adjustment of selected media components and supplementation with a variety of compounds was performed to alter various metabolic pathways, enzyme activities and in some cases the gene expression levels of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells in culture. The supplementation of cell culture medium with the trisaccharide raffinose in fed-batch cultures entailed an increase of the abundance of high mannose glycans in two different CHO cell lines. Raffinose especially favored mannose 5 glycans. At the same time, it impaired cell culture performance, induced changes on the intracellular nucleotide levels and even varied the expression levels of glycosylation-related genes. Supplementation with a number of galactosyltransferase inhibiting compounds, in particular fluorinated galactose analogs (alpha- and beta- 2 F-peracetyl-galactose), consistently decreased the production of galactosylated monoclonal antibodies (mAb). By means of targeted addition during the culture rather than at the beginning, the inhibition was further increased, while limiting detrimental effects on both growth and productivity. High-throughput screening in 96 -deepwell plates showed that spermine and L-ornithine also reduced the level of galactosylation. On the other hand, exploratory screening of a variety of potentially disulfide-bridge-reducing agents highlighted that the inherent low-molecular-species level of the proprietary platform cell culture process was likely due to favored reduction. This hypothesis was reinforced by the observation that supplementation of cysteine and N-acetylcysteine promoted fragmentation. Additionally, fragmentation decreased with higher protein expression. At that point, aiming to improve the efficiency in process development, a rational experimental design method was developed to identify and to define the optimal concentration range of quality modulating compounds by calling on a combination of high throughput fed-batch testing and multivariate data analysis. Seventeen medium supplements were tested in five parallel 96 -deepwell plate experiments. The selection process of promising modulators for the follow-up experiment in shake tubes consisted in a three-step procedure, including principal component analysis, quantitative evaluation of their performance with respect to the specifications for biosimilarity and selection following a hierarchical order of decisions using a decision tree. The method resulted in a substantial improvement of the targeted glycosylation profile in only two experimental rounds. Subsequent development stages, namely validation and transfer to industrial-scale facilities require tight control of product quality. Accordingly, further mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes was acquired by non-targeted metabolomic profiling of a CHO cell line expressing a mAb cultured in four distinct process formats. Univariate analysis of intra- and extracellular metabolite and temporal glycosylation profiles provided insights in various pathways. The numerous of parameters were the main driver to carry out principal component analysis, and then, using the methodology of partial-least-square (PLS) projection on latent structures, a multivariate model was built to correlate the extracellular data with the distinct glycosylation profiles. The PLS observation model proved to be reliable and showed its great benefit for glycan pattern control in routine manufacturing, especially at large scale. Rather than relying on post-production interpretation of glycosylation results, glycosylation can be predicted in real-time based on the extracellular metabolite levels in the bioreactor. Finally, for the bioactivity assessment of the glycan differences between the biosimilar and the <b>reference</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> (RMP), the health agencies may ask for in the drug registration process, extended ranges of glycan variants need to be generated so that the in vitro assays pick up the changes. The developed glycosylation modulator library enabled the generation of extreme glycosylation variants, including high mannose, afucosylated, galactosylated as well as sialic acid species of both a mAb and an antibody fusion molecule with three N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, to create increased variety, enzymatic glycoengineering was explored for galactosylation and sialylation. The glyco variants induced significant responses in the respective in vitro biological activity assays. The data of this work highlight the immense potential of cell culture medium optimization to adjust product quality. Medium and feed supplementation of a variety of compounds resulted in reproducible and important changes of the product quality profile of both mAbs and a fusion antibody. In addition to the intermediate modulation ranges that largely met the requirements for new-biological-entity and biosimilar development, medium supplementation even enabled quick and straightforward generation of extreme glycan variants suitable for biological activity testing. Mehr als die Hälfte der Biotherapeutika werden heutzutage aufgrund korrekter Proteinfaltung und korrektem Zusammenbau in tierischen Zelllinien hergestellt, welche zudem die Fähigkeit besitzen, verschiedene posttranslationale Modifikationen zu bewerkstelligen, hergestellt. Der ausgeprägte Aufschwung von Biosimilars hat den Entwicklungsschwerpunkt von Zellkulturverfahren verlagert. Dabei hat die Modulierung der Qualitätsattribute von rekombinanten Proteinen bereits in frühen Entwicklungsstadien eine wichtige Bedeutung erlangt. Die Qualitätsattribute beeinflussen die klinische Wirksamkeit und die In-Vivo-Sicherheit direkt. Somit ist die Regulierung der posttranslationalen Modifikationen, einschließlich der Glykosylierung (mannosereiche, fukosylierte, galaktosylierte und sialylierte Glykane), der Ladungsvarianten, sowie die Bildung von Aggregaten und niedermolekularen Spezien, für effiziente Rezeptorbindung und das Auslösen der gewünschten Immunantwort in Patienten entscheidend. Im Rahmen der Biosimilarentwicklung werden Methoden zur Anpassung der Produktqualität innerhalb des Potentials der Wirtszelle gesucht, um sie möglichst genau dem Referenzarzneimittel anzugleichen. Die Umgebung, in der die Zelle verweilt, beeinflusst ihren Metabolismus und das resultierende Produktqualitätsprofil. Dabei spielen Medien eine zentrale Rolle in der Zellkultur. Im Rahmen dieser Doktorarbeit wurden durch Adjustierung von ausgewählten Medienbestandteilen und Ergänzung mit einer Vielfalt von Stoffen diverse Stoffwechselwege, Enzymaktivitäten und in einigen Fällen das Genexpressionsniveau von kultivierten Chinesischen Hamster-Ovarialzellen (CHO) verändert. Die Ergänzung von Zellkulturmedium mit Raffinose, ein Trisaccharid, führte zu einer Erhöhung des mannosereichen Glykosylierungsmusters in zwei unterschiedlichen CHO-Zelllinien. Raffinose begünstigte hauptsächlich Mannose- 5 -Spezien. Gleichzeitig wurde die Zellkulturleistung beeinträchtigt und zudem intrazelluläre Nukleotidkonzentrationen sowie das Expressionsniveau von Glykosylierungsgenen verändert. Ergänzung mit mehreren Inhibitoren der Galaktosyltransferase, insbesondere fluorierte Galaktosenachbildungen (Alpha- und Beta- 2 F-Peracetyl-Galaktose), verringerte stetig die Produktion von galaktosylierten monoklonalen Antikörpern (mAb). Durch gezielte Zugabe im Verlauf der Kultur, statt bereits am Anfang, wurde die Inhibition weiter erhöht, und dabei die Einwirkung auf das Zellwachstum und die Produktivität beschränkt. Ein Hochdurchsatz-Screening in 96 -Deep-Well-Platten zeigte, dass Spermin und L-Ornithin auch das Ausmaß der Galaktosylierung reduzierte. Andererseits zeigten erste Nachforschungen anhand eines Screenings einer Auswahl von potenziellen Disulfidbrücken-Reduktionsmittel, dass wahrscheinlich begünstigte Reduktion das inhärente Niedermolekular-Speziesniveau des firmeneigenen Zellkulturplattformverfahrens verursacht. Die Hypothese wurde durch die Beigabe von Cystein und N-Acetylcystein bekräftigt. Diese Stoffe begünstigten die Fragmentierung, wohingegen sie bei höherer Proteinexpression abnahm. Mit dem Ziel die Entwicklungseffizienz zu steigern, wurde daraufhin zur Identifikation von qualitätsverändernden Stoffen und Bestimmung der optimalen Konzentrationsbereichen eine rationale Versuchsanordnungsmethode entwickelt. Dazu wurde eine Kombination von Hochdurchsatz-Fed-Batch-Tests und multivariater Datenanalyse herbeigezogen. Siebzehn Mediumergänzungsstoffe wurden in fünf parallelen 96 -Deep-Well-Platten-Experimenten getestet. Das Auswahlverfahren von erfolgsversprechenden Modulatoren fürs Nachfolgeexperiment in Schüttelröhrchen umfasste drei Schritte: Hauptkomponentenanalyse, quantitative Evaluierung der Leistung der Modulatoren hinsichtlich der Biosimilaritätsspezifikationen und die Auswahl in Anlehnung an eine hierarchische Entscheidungsreihenfolge mit Hilfe eines Entscheidungsbaums. Die Methode führte in nur zwei Versuchsreihen zu einer erheblichen Annäherung an das gewünschte Glykosylierungsprofil. Anschließende Entwicklungsschritte (Validierung und Transfer in die großtechnische Anlage) erforden eine rigorose Kontrolle der Produktqualität. Demzufolge konnte dank der Non-Targeted Metabolomics Analyse von vier verschiedenen Herstellungsverfahren einer mAb exprimierenden CHO-Zelllinie weitere mechanistische Kenntnisse der zugrunde liegenden Vorgängen gewonnen werden. Univariate Analysen der intra- und extrazellulären Stoffwechselprodukte und die zeitliche Glykosylierungsprofile lieferten einen Einblick in verschiedene Stoffwechselwege. Die Vielzahl von Parametern führte dazu, nach dem Prinzip der Hauptkomponentenanalyse vorzugehen, und dann anhand der Partial Least Squares (PLS) -Projektion auf latente Strukturen ein multivariates Modell zu erstellen, das die extrazellulären Daten mit den individuellen Glykosylierungsprofilen korreliert. Das PLS Beobachtungsmodell stellte sich als verlässlich heraus und zeigte seinen außerordentlichen Nutzen zur Regulierung der Glykanen in der Routineherstellung, insbesondere in der Großanlage. Anstatt sich auf Glykosylierungsresultate nach dem Ende der Produktion zu verlassen, kann die Glykosylierung, basierend auf den Niveaus der extrazellulären Stoffwechselprodukte im Bioreaktor, in Echtzeit vorausgesagt werden. Schließlich können im Rahmen des Arzneigenehmigungsverfahrens Gesundheitsbehörden verlangen, die Glykanunterschiede zwischen dem Biosimilar und dem Referenzarzneimittel zu untersuchen. Damit der biologische Test die Unterschiede nachweisen kann, muss eine erweiterte Palette von Glykanvarianten hergestellt werden. Die entwickelte Glykosylierungsmodulierungsbibliothek ermöglichte, extreme Varianten für mannosereiche, afukosylierte, galaktosylierte und sialylierte Glykane von mAb und einem Antikörperfusionsmolekül mit drei N-Glykosylierungsstellen zu generieren. Für erhöhte Variantenvielfalt wurde die enzymatische Glykoengineering Technologie für die Galaktosylierung und Sialylierung untersucht. Die Glykanvarianten erzeugten signifikante Antworten in der jeweiligen In-Vitro-Bestimmung der biologischen Aktivität. Die Ergebnisse unterstreichen das immense Potential von Zellkulturmediumoptimierung zur Anpassung der Produktqualität. Ergänzung des Mediums und der Nährstofflösung brachte reproduzierbare und beträchtliche Veränderungen der Produktqualität von mAb und eines Fusionsantikörpers hervor. Zusätzlich zu den intermediären Modulierungsbereichen, die mehr als ausreichend den Anforderungen für die Entwicklung von neuen biologischen Wirkstoffen und Biosimilars genügen, ermöglichte die Mediumergänzung auf schnelle und einfache Art und Weise selbst extreme Glykanvarianten zu bilden, die für die Bestimmung der biologischen Aktivität geeignet waren...|$|E
