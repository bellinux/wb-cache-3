25|$|By 1995, {{many of the}} DOS-based BBSes {{had begun}} {{switching}} to modern multitasking operating systems, such as OS/2, Windows 95, and Linux. One of the first graphics based BBS applications was Excalibur BBS with a low bandwidth applications that required its own client for efficiency. This led {{to one of the}} earliest implementations of Electronic Commerce in 1996 with replication of partner stores around the globe. TCP/IP networking allowed most of the remaining BBSes to evolve and include Internet hosting capabilities. Recent BBS software, such as Synchronet, Mystic BBS, EleBBS, DOC or Wildcat! BBS, provide access using the Telnet protocol rather than dialup, or by using legacy DOS-based BBS software with a FOSSIL-to-Telnet <b>redirector</b> such as NetFoss.|$|E
2500|$|WebDAV {{has been}} {{enhanced}} to support operation over SSL connections, {{as well as}} connecting on alternate ports. An update for Windows XP SP2 which supports this feature is also available. However, in Windows Vista, only the WebDAV <b>redirector</b> is present while the original [...] "Web folders" [...] client has been removed. The Web Folders client is only installed if Office 2003 or {{an earlier version of}} Office is installed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{security}} subsystem deals with security tokens, grants or denies access to user accounts based on resource permissions, handles login requests and initiates login authentication, and determines which system resources {{need to be}} audited by Windows NT. It also looks after Active Directory. [...] The workstation service implements the network <b>redirector,</b> which is the client side of Windows file and print sharing; it implements local requests to remote files and printers by [...] "redirecting" [...] them to the appropriate servers on the network. Conversely, the server service allows other computers on the network to access file shares and shared printers offered by the local system.|$|E
2500|$|... "'Covert Redirect', publicized in May, 2014, is an {{instance}} of attackers using open <b>redirectors</b> – a well-known threat, with well-known means of prevention. The OpenID Connect protocol mandates strict measures that preclude open <b>redirectors</b> to prevent this vulnerability." ...|$|R
50|$|Because COM port <b>redirectors</b> emulate COM ports on the {{operating}} system abstraction level, rather than hardware serial ports, old software which is not written to utilize {{the operating}} system, but instead interface directly with a serial microcontroller (hardware ports 0x3F8 to 0x3FF for COM1, for example) will not function with COM port <b>redirectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Redirectors</b> {{address a}} number of issues related to the network connection, including: ...|$|R
5000|$|MAFIAAFire <b>Redirector</b> users couldn't {{actually}} see the list of [...] "blocked sites" [...] in version 0.4b. Instead, MAFIAAFire <b>Redirector</b> users needed to trust the MAFIAAFire <b>Redirector</b> webpage. This was changed in 0.6b so the blocklist was easily accessible. Just after MAFIAAFire <b>Redirector</b> was released, the addon redirected atdhe.net to atdhenet.tv, but this wasn't shown on the official list.|$|E
50|$|In DOS and Windows, {{a network}} <b>redirector,</b> or <b>redirector,</b> is an {{operating}} system driver that sends data to and receives {{data from a}} remote device. A network <b>redirector</b> provides mechanisms to locate, open, read, write, and delete files and submit print jobs.|$|E
50|$|Applications use a COM port <b>redirector</b> {{through one}} or more virtual COM ports that the <b>redirector</b> creates, as {{configured}} by the user. When the application opens the virtual COM port, the <b>redirector</b> makes an IP network connection to the device server at the specified IP address and TCP/UDP port number that corresponds to the remote device on the server. The COM port <b>redirector</b> then begins relaying the application data stream between the virtual COM port and the device server.|$|E
50|$|In Microsoft Networking, {{the network}} <b>redirectors</b> are {{implemented}} as Installable File Systems (IFS).|$|R
50|$|Networks Hosts {{communicate}} {{through use of}} this client software: Shells, <b>Redirectors</b> and Requesters.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{types of}} <b>redirectors</b> {{have been offered}} {{to meet the needs}} of certain applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{performance}} of a COM port <b>redirector</b> is determined by both its implementation and the network it uses to reach device servers. The performance drawbacks of simple <b>redirector</b> implementations can be largely addressed by kernel-level drivers that avoid context switches. Network packet loss or excessive packet times have dramatic effects on <b>redirector</b> operation and must be avoided.|$|E
50|$|A COM port <b>redirector</b> (tty port <b>redirector</b> under Unix/Linux) is {{specialized}} software (often including device driver and user application) {{that includes the}} underlying network software necessary to access networked device servers that provide remote serial devices or modems.|$|E
50|$|It {{provides}} application {{services such}} as named pipes and MailSlots. When an application needs to send or receive data from a remote device, it sends {{a call to the}} <b>redirector.</b> The <b>redirector</b> provides the functionality of the presentation layer of the OSI model.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Redirectors</b> {{must also}} {{deal with the}} feature {{differences}} of networked device servers related to: ...|$|R
50|$|In version 0.4b, {{there was}} code to {{redirect}} to the MAFIAAFire <b>Redirector's</b> website on every 15 uses, that code {{has now been}} removed.|$|R
50|$|In {{light of}} {{concerns}} raised by its users, the MAFIAAFire <b>Redirector's</b> code was doubled {{to put in}} all the features its user base requested.|$|R
50|$|A <b>redirector</b> will {{typically}} permit {{creation of}} many (at least 256) virtual COM ports, but simultaneous use {{of hundreds of}} ports is often practically limited {{by a number of}} factors, including the memory and processor requirements of the <b>redirector,</b> limits on operating system resources, and the performance of the network stack.|$|E
50|$|A <b>redirector</b> for the Windows {{operating}} system is typically configured using a control-panel style {{graphical user interface}} for creating virtual COM ports, configuring settings for individual COM ports, and configuring global settings affecting all COM ports. The <b>redirector</b> GUI typically also includes displays of virtual COM port activity and various diagnostic aids.|$|E
5000|$|... {{penetration}} testing features, including a port scanner and a port <b>redirector</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Domain hacks {{offer the}} ability to produce short domain names. This makes them {{potentially}} valuable as <b>redirectors,</b> pastebins, base domains from which to delegate subdomains and URL shortening services.|$|R
50|$|Several {{days before}} the initial sale with WOSU-FM was announced, Fun With Radio, LLC {{registered}} the domain names CD101at1025.com and CD1025.com, which have since acted as <b>redirectors</b> to the current CD101.com website.|$|R
50|$|Installable File System Manager (Input/Output Subsystem): Coordinates {{access to}} {{supported}} file systems. Windows 95 initially shipped with support for FAT12, FAT16, the VFAT extension, ISO 9660 (CDFS) and network <b>redirectors,</b> with later releases supporting FAT32.|$|R
50|$|One {{variant of}} a COM port <b>redirector</b> {{is a virtual}} serial port. A virtual serial port is a <b>redirector</b> without network {{software}} support which is usually {{used to create a}} pair of back-to-back virtual COM ports on the same computer. Two legacy applications can then communicate using virtual serial ports instead of conventional inter-process communication mechanisms such as named pipes.|$|E
50|$|A <b>redirector</b> may support {{back-to-back}} operation, {{in which}} two computers run copies of the <b>redirector</b> and an outbound connection from one results in an inbound connection to the other. In effect, this technique creates a serial communications tunnel through a network connection. In practice, this configuration works only for certain applications but offers potentially lower costs and higher performance using the Internet to carry serial communications instead of modems between two computers.|$|E
5000|$|Visibility {{and control}} of serial line signals such as DSR, DCD, CTS, DTR. The <b>redirector</b> {{may be able to}} {{sufficiently}} emulate these signals.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, Novell had {{announced}} plans to convert their resident workstation management utilities {{as well as their}} DOS network driver stacks (shells, <b>redirectors</b> and requestors) to use DPMS, however, so far only the Personal NetWare server component had actually taken advantage of it.|$|R
50|$|Windows for Workgroups 3.11 (originally codenamed Snowball) was {{released}} on August 11, 1993, and shipped in November 1993. It supported 32-bit file access, full 32-bit network <b>redirectors,</b> and VCACHE.386 file cache, shared between them. WFW 3.11 dropped standard mode support and requires a 386 machine to run.|$|R
30|$|Through {{analyzing}} the redirection {{traces of the}} campaign, we found that two Aka- mai Bars, akamaid.net_cdncache 3 -a and akamaihd_asrv-a, frequently inject scripts into compromised websites, which serve as first-hop <b>redirectors</b> to move a visitor down the redirection chain before hitting malicious landing pages (that serve malicious content). Interestingly, all the follow-up <b>redirectors</b> are compromised or malicious websites that are not hosted on the cloud. The scripts in the Bars were found to change over time, redirecting the visitor to different next-hop sites (also <b>redirectors).</b> On average, {{the life span of}} such sites is only 120  h, but the Bar was still alive when we submitted this paper. Such redirections end at at least 216 mali- cious landing sites, which all retrieve deceptive images from an Amazon S 3 bucket s 3.amazonaws.com_cicloudfront (a Bar never reported before and is still alive). An example is a system update warning, as shown in Fig.  1. From the reposi- tory, we collected 134 images, including those for free software installation, updates on all mainstream OSes, browsers and some popular applications. If she clicks and downloads the program promoted on the site, the code will be fetched from multiple Bars, such as s 3.amazonaws.com_wbt_media where the PUP puts a Bitcoin miner on the victim’s system, and cloudfront.net_d 12 mrm 7 igk 59 vq, whose program modifies Chrome’s security setting.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, the {{association}} {{can be made}} explicit using an entry in an Advanced Stream <b>Redirector</b> (ASX) file. The user opens the ASX file instead.|$|E
50|$|The Advanced Stream <b>Redirector</b> (ASX) {{format is}} a type of XML {{metafile}} designed to store a playlist of Windows Media files for a multimedia presentation.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>redirector</b> {{may include}} a modem {{emulator}} {{that allows the}} application to use [...] "AT" [...] modem commands even though no physical modem is present. The [...] "number" [...] dialed is an IP address, and the connection is a TCP network connection instead of a modem telephone call. This type of <b>redirector</b> is generally used by applications in originating client software needs to use a modem but the destination for the connection is a network endpoint. Back-to-back operation {{of this type of}} <b>redirector</b> can, in some cases, function as a replacement for modems on two computers for some applications. Network effects on timing of the data stream generally preclude the use of this method for transmitting faxes. Additionally, this method is also not reliable if used for PPP connections (such as dial-up networking) due to architectural limitations of TCP, a topic discussed in technical literature related to TCP-over-TCP.|$|E
50|$|This {{was fixed}} by {{a better way}} of {{alerting}} the user when the blocklist gets updated (new domains pop up in a notification box), a clickable notification box so the users know at all times which domains are on the direction list, this same list is also accessible via the <b>Redirector's</b> Options and storage of the list on the users computers rather than downloading a fresh list on every restart.|$|R
25|$|A further {{problem with}} URLs {{has been found}} in the {{handling}} of internationalized domain names (IDN) in web browsers, that might allow visually identical web addresses to lead to different, possibly malicious, websites. Despite the publicity surrounding the flaw, known as IDN spoofing or homograph attack, phishers have taken advantage of a similar risk, using open URL <b>redirectors</b> on the websites of trusted organizations to disguise malicious URLs with a trusted domain.|$|R
50|$|Like many Unix {{commands}}, SAMtool commands {{follow a}} stream model, where data runs through each command as if {{carried on a}} conveyor belt. This allows combining multiple commands into a data processing pipeline. Although the final output can be very complex, {{only a limited number}} of simple commands are needed to produce it. If not specified, the standard streams (stdin, stdout, and stderr) are assumed. Data sent to stdout are printed to the screen by default but are easily redirected to another file using the normal Unix <b>redirectors</b> (> and >>), or to another command via a pipe (|).|$|R
