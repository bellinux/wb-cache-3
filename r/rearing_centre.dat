40|$|Bark {{stripping}} {{damage is}} a serious problem in some forest hunting grounds in Serbia. This study aimed at assessing the incidence and intensity of bark stripping by red deer in the fenced <b>rearing</b> <b>centre</b> “Lomnička Reka“ (Mt. Veliki Jastrebac, central Serbia). The data were collected by detailed surveying of the entire <b>rearing</b> <b>centre</b> over spring and autumn 2008, 2009 and 2010. Our results show that, in spring and summer, it is exclusively broadleaf tree species that are bark stripped by red deer, mainly beech (86. 3 % or 536 trees) and hornbeam (10. 1 % or 63 trees). The incidence and intensity of bark stripping were the highest in the diameter class of 20 - 39. 9 cm. Damaged trees were identified {{in all parts of the}} <b>rearing</b> <b>centre,</b> at all aspects and at different slopes. Beech bark was stripped over the period May-August, with the focus in June or July...|$|E

The objective {{of this paper is}} to identify the rates and types of damage by red deer and wild boar at three localities: (1) fenced part of the hunting ground 'Crni Lug' (Srem), (2) fenced part of the hunting ground 'Podunavsko Lovište Plavna' (Southwestern Bačka), and (3) fenced <b>rearing</b> <b>centre</b> 'Lomnička Reka' (Mt. Veliki Jastrebac). The damage was not recorded on locality (1). The damage on locality (2) (new polar plantations) and locality (3) (beech forests) was caused by red deer. The main causes of the damage were excessive density and disturbed population structure (sex and age), nonharmonised forest and hunting management, shortage of natural food, especially of pasture areas...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} {{hematological}} and serum biochemical {{parameters of the}} critically endangered gharial (Gavialis gangeticus). Materials and Methods: Blood samples for hemato-biochemical analyses were collected from the ventral median coccygeal vein of six juvenile and six sub adult gharials of Dewari Gharial <b>Rearing</b> <b>Centre</b> of National Chambal Sanctuary, Madhya Pradesh, India. Hematological examination was performed manually. Differential leukocyte count {{was performed on the}} blood smears stained with Giemsa’s stain. The analysis of serum was conducted by eppendorf ECOM-F 6124 semi auto biochemical analyzer using standard ERBA biochemical reagent kits. Results: Peripheral blood cells of gharial showed erythrocytes with an oval outline and centrally located prominent round to oval nucleus. Erythrocyte count in sub adult gharials was significantly greater than juveniles. Whereas erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume and erythrocyte size in juveniles was significantly larger than sub adults. The average most abundant leukocyte type in gharial was lymphocytes (53 %), followed by heterophils (27 %), eosinophils (10 %), monocytes (7 %) and basophils (3 %). Aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, triglycerides and albumin concentrations in sub adult gharials were significantly higher than juveniles. No significant differences were determined in other hemato-biochemical parameters between juvenile and sub adult gharials under study...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{describe}} the postnatal growth performance (period from birth to weaning) in Brown hare (Lepus europaeus) leverets in a <b>rearing</b> <b>centre</b> of Southern Italy. Three morpho- metric variables (body weight, hind foot length and ear length) were measured weekly from birth to wean- ing (at 21 days) in 78 leverets. Data were analysed by proc GLM (SAS) considering the effect of sex and birth period (1. January-February, 2. March-April, and 3. May-June). Birth period influenced significantly live weight at 14 14 th day of life, lower inperiod 2 thanin 3 (553 vs. 607 g;P period 2 than in 3 (553 vs. 607 g;P (553 vs. 607 g; P≤ 0. 05) and hind foot length at birth, shorter in period 1 compared to the period 2 and 3 (4. 4 vs. 4. 7 and 4. 8 cm; P≤ 0. 05), and at weaning, shorter in period 1 than in 3 (8. 6 vs. 9. 6 cm; P≤ 0. 05).

40|$|A newly-introduced pest poses {{a serious}} Ask for Africa's {{domestic}} and wild animals {{and also to}} the human population. It is the New World Screwworm fly (NWS), Cochliomyia hominivorax, or 'devourer of man''. Female screwworm flies lay their eggs in wounds such as insect bites, scratches, wounds caused by shearing, castration, de-horning and branding or the umbilicus of newborn animals. The eggs hatch into larvae, or maggots, which eat deeply into the living flesh; {{in a very short}} time a skin puncture or abrasion as small as a tick bite or scratch can be transformed into a large and dangerous wound. Unless treated quickly, even full grown cattle can die within days. The NSW is the most destructive pest of livestock in the Americas. Its presence outside the Western Hemisphere was confirmed for the first time in April 1989 in Libya. It is thought to have entered Libya on sheep imported from Latin America. The fly has been known to migrate up to 200 kilometres, although the pest most commonly spreads in the larval form through the transport of infested animals. The pest's range used to extend from Florida to Texas in the United States, through Central America and some Caribbean islands into the temperate zones of South America. It has already cost the US and Mexico US$ 500 million to eradicate the screwworm from the US and most of Mexico. It is feared that if the pest is not eradicated very quickly from Libya, it will spread into neighbouring countries, across the Sahara into tropical Africa and even around the Mediterranean basin, into Southern Europe, and possibly into West Asia. Eradication the aim It is possible to treat domestic livestock attacked by NWS but great expense and effort are involved. The possible effects on the wild animal population of Africa which cannot be treated, are alarming. Once infested, wild animals would become a continuing reservoir of infection probably causing more widespread and devastating losses than tsetse. The female screwworm lays clutches of up to 400 eggs at about three-day intervals before she dies. Larvae hatch 11 to 24 hours later and begin to feed on the host's tissues. The wounds produce an odour that then attracts more flies. After feeding and growing for four to eight days, the larvae drop to the ground, burrow into the soil and pupate. Adult flies emerge in as little as seven days and complete a life cycle that can be as short as three weeks (see diagram). The only worthwhile option is to eradicate the screwworm totally and the only proven technique is to combine the release of sterile male flies from the air with strict ground controls on the movements of animals, quarantine, monitoring and preventative treatment of wounds. The sterile insect technique (SIT) was pioneered in the US 33 years ago. A special <b>rearing</b> <b>centre</b> propagates flies and bombards the larvae with a carefully controlled dose of gamma radiation to make them sterile without weakening or reducing the male's desire to mate. The irradiated pupae are packaged and delivered to the infested area, ready to hatch. The flies are then loaded into light aircraft for dispersal. The technique is effective because the female NWS, mating with a sterile male, lays eggs that do not hatch. The female usually mates only once while the males mate five or six times; saturating an area with sterile males, that greatly outnumber the local fertile males, and results in population decline and eventual eradication. Action to-date The Libyan Government has already spent over $ 7. 5 million to fight the screwworm. It has fielded more than 90 teams to inspect and treat wounded animals every 21 days in the infested and adjacent areas and has set up 12 quarantine stations to control movement of animals. In July 1989, FAO and the UN Development Programme organized a regional training course for officials from Libya, Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Niger, Sudan, Morocco and Tunisia. A second training course was held in Libya in March for African countries farther from Libya, which are considered 'the second line of defence. ' And components for 1, 750, 000 animal treatment and sampling kits together with information material in Arabic, English and French have been provided to Libya and neighbouring countries. To meet the North African emergency, transport planes will make at least two deliveries each week of irradiated flies from Mexico to the operation headquarters in Libya. Millions of flies will be released to achieve a ratio of at least 10 sterile males to each local male. FAO estimates that it would cost $ 42 million per year for two years to mount a full eradication programme. However, this expense is only a fraction of the losses that a widespread infestation would cause. If it is not eradicated from Libya, the estimated costs of controlling the screwworm in the five countries of North Africa alone would exceed $ 250 million per year. The costs of further spread are incalculable: this is truly a now-or-never opportunity to eradicate screwworm from Africa.
