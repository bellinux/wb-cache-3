40|$|In {{this paper}} a <b>repairable</b> <b>item</b> {{system for the}} {{maintenance}} support of a fleet of aircraft is introduced. The purpose of the system, a complex conjunction of repair departments and stock locations, is the repair and supply of serviceable engines to the maintenance process of the aircraft. The performance of the <b>repairable</b> <b>item</b> system is measured by a service level. If the realized service level corresponds with the required service level, conditions are created among which the maintenance process {{can be carried out}} efficiently. Thus the setting of service levels is a means for the control of the <b>repairable</b> <b>item</b> system. To meet the required service level target for the entire <b>repairable</b> <b>item</b> system, {{it is important that the}} performance of the individual repair departments and the stock locations of the <b>repairable</b> <b>item</b> system are tuned. In this coordination process, service level targets must also be set for the repair departments and stock locations. In this paper it is show that the deduction of these service level targets can be supported with the help of well-known models such as METRIC and MOD-METRIC. In a numerical analysis it is shown that the targets for the repair departments can be substantially lower than the targets for the downstream stock locations of the <b>repairable</b> <b>item</b> system...|$|E

This research compares Navy inventory management to commercial inventory management in proposed and existing outsourcing programs and develops a model which the NAVICP can use to estimate the potential success for outsourcing <b>repairable</b> <b>items.</b> The research develops an inventory surcharge of 19 percent. The inventory surcharge represents the Navy's costs to perform functions which can be outsourced and serves as a benchmark for comparison to commercial costs.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the determination of}} the spare inventory level for a multiechelon <b>repairable</b> <b>item</b> inventory system, which has several bases and a central depot with emergency lateral transshipment capability. Previous research is extended by removing a restrictive assumption on the repair time distribution. A mathematical model that allows a general repair time distribution, as well as an algorithm to find a solution of the model, is developed. Thus, the main focus {{of this study is to}} improve the accuracy of previous models and to estimate the gain in accuracy from use of the current methodology. Computational experiments are performed to estimate the accuracy improvement and to determine the managerial implications of the results.

40|$|The popular {{models for}} <b>repairable</b> <b>item</b> inventory, {{both in the}} {{literature}} as well as practical applications, assume that the demands for items are independent {{of the number of}} working systems. However this assumption can introduce a serious underestimation of availability when the number of working systems is small, the failure rate is high or the repair time is long. In this paper, we study a multi-echelon <b>repairable</b> <b>item</b> inventory system under the phenomenon of passivation, i. e. serviceable items are passivated (‘‘switched off’’) upon system failure. This work is motivated by corrective maintenance of high-cost technical equipment in the miltary. We propose an efficient approximation model to compute time-varying availability. Experiments show that our analytical model agrees well with Monte Carlo simulation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractExpensive {{parts of}} {{machines}} {{do not have}} to be discarded when broken. Instead they can be repaired and put back into stock, forming a <b>repairable</b> <b>item</b> system. Lots of methods are known to determine stock levels, the number of backordered parts and waiting times in <b>repairable</b> <b>item</b> systems. Some of these methods consider limited repair capacity, but assume the capacity to be constant. In industrial practice, however, the capacity in the repair shop varies due to vacation times of the workers, reducing it temporarily. At the end of the vacation times the backorders of unrepaired, broken parts in the repair shop and unfulfilled part requests at the depot have to be diminished. Furthermore, the varying capacity influences the performance of the spare parts provisioning, incurring the need for higher stock levels. The impact of varying repair capacity on a system for repairable items is analyzed in this paper. It is shown how the stock levels have to be adjusted to guarantee a maximum backorder level of waiting request during the entire year...|$|E

40|$|Navy Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) is the {{principle}} controller of the Navy's inventory consisting of over 470, 000 line items valued at over $ 30 B. NAVICP provides the Fleet the parts necessary to maintain weapons systems. In 2003, NAVICP spent over $ 444 M in transportation charges to fulfill customer requests for repair parts. The research in this thesis {{is the result of}} an initiative by NAVICP to study the benefits in modifying their current inventory positioning policy for repairable items.

SIP provides NAVICP an optimization-based tool to aid in determining the strategic inventory location for each <b>repairable</b> <b>item.</b> Using results from SIP and historical transaction data, a cost comparative analysis of 176 of the highest cost and demand volume items shows that using a new synchronized and scheduled truck delivery system combined with strategically locating both new procurements and returns from repair in depots near high demand concentrations, enables NAVICP to reduce annual transportation costs by an average of $ 110 K per <b>repairable</b> <b>item...</b>|$|E

40|$|Reducing U. S. Navy {{inventory}} control {{problems associated with}} the F/ A- 18 C/D aircraft is critical to maintaining squadron readiness while minimizing procurement and repair costs. The Navy's Inventory Control Point has designed its Carcass Express program to ensure that critically short depot level repairables are serviced more quickly. The program was initiated on the S- 3 Viking aircraft in 1999. Subsequently, the number of constrained carcasses was reduced by 40 percent, and the average depot repair cycle time was reduced by 12 days. This thesis attempts to quantify the savings that can be realized by instituting the Carcass Express program for the F/A- 18 C/D. Data for F/A- 18 C/D <b>repairable</b> <b>items</b> that were identified as having insufficient carcasses for repair to meet current demand levels are analyzed. These <b>repairable</b> <b>items</b> have high dollar values and significant backorders severely impacting squadron readiness. It is shown that the Carcass Express program would provide an additional accrual of inventory over a four-year period for the items studied. The required funding needed to support the deficit between items available from the depot repair cycle and forecast quarterly demands would decrease. The Carcass Express initiative would improve the predictability of the Depot Repair Cycle by reducing repair cycle variability. This ultimately would lead to better inventory management...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{forecasting}} {{of repair}} turn-around time (RTAT) of United States Navy depot level <b>repairable</b> <b>items</b> {{is critical to}} achieving optimal service levels while minimizing procurement and repair costs. The Navy's Inventory Control Point has developed a forecast model that uses sophisticated Statistical Process Control techniques and non-parametric algorithms to forecast RTAT. This thesis attempts to validate the Navy's RTAT forecast model by comparing its performance to those of simple time series forecasting methods. It {{was found that the}} assumptions implicit in the UICP RTAT forecast model {{have a significant impact on}} forecast accuracy. In addition to documenting these model properties, a goal of this thesis is to identify variables that the UICP model does not use in RTAT forecasting which may improve its accuracy. The research focuses on data for <b>repairable</b> <b>items</b> that have high dollar value and the greatest number of repair transactions per quarter. Results show that the Navy's model is not consistently more accurate than any of the alternative techniques examined, and that it tends to ignore many large RTAT observations, causing it to under-forecast RTAT. Thesis research also reveals that accounting for differences in disparate designated overhaul points may significantly improve the prediction of RTAT. Finally it is shown that additional variables, derived from a NAVICP Philadelphia database and designed to capture the queueing aspect of the repair process, may significantly improve the prediction of RTAT. These findings point to the use of queueing information to obtain more accurate RTAT forecasts. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
