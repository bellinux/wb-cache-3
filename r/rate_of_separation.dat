This paper presents such a framework, beginning with a kinematic expression for the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> the <b>separation</b> vector between two adjacent air parcels. The maximum growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>separation</b> vector is called the instantaneous dilatation rate and its orientation is called the axis of dilatation. Similarly, a maximum decay rate is called the instantaneous contraction rate and its orientation is called the axis of contraction. These expressions are related to the vector frontogenesis function, in that the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>separation</b> vector corresponds with the scalar frontogenesis function, and the rotation <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>separation</b> vector corresponds with the rotational component of the vector frontogenesis function. Because vorticity can rotate air-parcel pairs out of regions of deformation, the instantaneous dilatation and contraction rates and axes may not be appropriate diagnostics of airstream boundaries for fluid flows in general.

It {{has been}} shown that severing the spindle at early anaphase B in living PtKi cells results in a dramatic increase in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> pole-pole <b>separation.</b> This result suggested that the asters pull on the spindle poles, putting tension on the spindle, while the spindle acts as a governor, limiting the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> pole <b>separation.</b> To further test these inferences, we used a UV-laser microbeam to damage one of the two asters in living PtK 2 cells at early anaphase B and monitored the effects on individual spindle pole movements, pole-pole separation rates and astral microtubules (MTs). Irradiation at the estimated position of a centrosome greatly reduced its array of astral MTs and nearly stopped the movement of the irradiated pole, whereas the sister pole retained its normal array of astral MTs and actually accelerated. Control irradiations, either close to the estimated position of the centrosome or beside the spindle at the equator, had little or no effect on either spindle pole movements or astral MTs. These results support the inferences that during anaphase B in living PtK cells, the central spindle is under tension generated by pulling forces in the asters (presumably MT-mediated) and that the spindle generates counterforces that limit the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> pole <b>separation.</b> The results also suggest that the central spindle in living PtK cells may be able to generate a pushing force...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} joint {{implications}} of search and matching frictions in labor markets for wage inequality, and quantifies {{the average amount}} {{and the distribution of}} specific job-matching capital, vulnerable to exogenous job destruction. Workers differ both ex-ante in their average individual productivity (skill) and ex-post in their luck when matching with employers, learn over time the quality of the match, bargain on a wage, and search on and off the job for new employers. Conditional on skills, learning and selection map gaussian output noise into an equilibrium stationary and ergodic wage distribution which is unimodal and right-skewed, with a Paretian right tail. In contrast to the predictions of the standard search environment with observable productivity, high idiosyncratic technological risk hinders learning and sorting, and tends to reduce wage inequality. The model is qualitatively consistent with a variety of additional stylized facts on worker turnover.
