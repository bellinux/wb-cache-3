40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} a breadth of computational aspects of analysis, from obtaining computable information from classical proofs in analysis to im-plementing real number computations efficiently in practice. The main contri-butions of the paper can be summarized as follows: • A generalization {{of a set of}} conditions given by Matiyasevich under which a <b>recursively</b> <b>defined</b> <b>sequence</b> of real numbers can be shown to converge computably. The generalization replaces monotonicity with a weaker con-dition and allows errors in the computation of the sequence. • The first explicit computable bound on the asymptotic regularity of Kras-noselski-Mann iterations with error terms of asymptotically quasi nonex-pansive self-mappings of closed convex subsets of uniformly convex Ba-nach spaces. The bound permits the computation of approximate fixed points of the function and relaxes the conditions under which the iteration can be shown to be asymptotically regular...|$|E
40|$|A {{compacted}} tree is a graph {{created from}} a binary tree such that repeatedly occurring subtrees {{in the original}} tree are represented by pointers to existing ones, and hence every subtree is unique. Such representations form a special class of directed acyclic graphs. We {{are interested in the}} asymptotic number of compacted trees of given size, where the size of a compacted tree is given by the number of its internal nodes. Due to its superexponential growth this problem poses many difficulties. Therefore we restrict our investigations to compacted trees of bounded right height, which is the maximal number of edges going to the right on any path from the root to a leaf. We solve the asymptotic counting problem for this class as well as a closely related, further simplified class. For this purpose, we develop a calculus on exponential generating functions for compacted trees of bounded right height and for relaxed trees of bounded right height, which differ from compacted trees by dropping the above described uniqueness condition. This enables us to derive a <b>recursively</b> <b>defined</b> <b>sequence</b> of differential equations for the exponential generating functions. The coefficients can then be determined by performing a singularity analysis of the solutions of these differential equations. Our main results are the computation of the asymptotic numbers of relaxed as well as compacted trees of bounded right height and given size, when the size tends to infinity.

40|$|Abstract. Utilizing {{spectral}} residues of parameterized, <b>recursively</b> <b>defined</b> <b>sequences,</b> {{we develop}} a general method for generating identities of composition sums. Specific results are obtained {{by focusing on}} coefficient sequences of solutions of first and second order, ordinary, linear differential equations. Regarding the first class, the corresponding identities amount to a proof of the exponential formula of labelled counting. The identities in the second class {{can be used to}} establish certain geometric properties of the simplex of bounded, ordered, integer tuples. We present three theorems that support the conclusion that the inner dimensions of such an order simplex are, in a certain sense, more ample than the outer dimensions. As well, we give an algebraic proof of a bijection between two families of subsets in the order simplex, and inquire as to the possibility of establishing this bijection by combinatorial, rather than by algebraic methods. 1...|$|R

5000|$|In mathematics, {{a formal}} power series is a {{generalization}} of a polynomial, where the number of terms is allowed to be infinite; this implies giving up the possibility of replacing the variable in the polynomial with an arbitrary number. Thus a {{formal power series}} differs from a polynomial in {{that it may have}} infinitely many terms, and differs from a power series, whose variables can take on numerical values. One way to view a formal power series is as an infinite ordered sequence of numbers. In this case, the powers of the variable are used only to indicate the order of the coefficients, so that the coefficient of [...] is the fifth term in the sequence. In combinatorics, formal power series provide representations of numerical sequences and of multisets, and for instance allow concise expressions for <b>recursively</b> <b>defined</b> <b>sequences</b> regardless of whether the recursion can be explicitly solved; this is known as the method of generating functions. More generally, formal power series can include series with any finite number of variables, and with coefficients in an arbitrary ring.|$|R

30|$|We {{notice that}} most of the above {{mentioned}} works concentrate on the continuous economic and financial models. There are very few works discussing the modeling of actual macroeconomic data using discrete dynamical system. In mathematics, a discrete dynamical system usually describes a recurrence relation, which is also an equation that <b>recursively</b> <b>defines</b> a <b>sequence</b> or multidimensional array of values once one or more initial terms are given. In difference equation, each further term of the sequence or array is defined {{as a function of the}} preceding terms. Discrete dynamical models are widely applied in many mathematical and engineering realms [29 – 31]. In real-world cases, many macroeconomic variables are observed sequently, i.e., daily, monthly or annually, which motivates us to construct a new model by using difference equation involving a generalized fractal derivative. The coupled relation of macroeconomic variables is expressed via a group of difference equations and the power-law property is characterized by the generalized fractal derivative containing two parameters.|$|R
