5|$|A <b>regeneration</b> {{scheme was}} {{announced}} in 2004; supported by the Phoenix Trust, the maltings would be converted into residential, retail and business space. Public consultation took place in 2005 and 2006, with around 90% of participants supporting <b>regeneration</b> and three-quarters asking for a cinema and entertainment complex. Lincolnshire Enterprise granted £200,000 towards the <b>regeneration</b> scheme and the Gladedale Group came forward to develop the project. Over the next three years, they worked with the Prince's <b>Regeneration</b> Trust to draw up plans for the site's <b>regeneration</b> which protected the historic exterior. In 2009, their proposals were submitted for planning permission. North Kesteven District Council approved the £50million development in 2011; Tesco was also granted permission to build a £20million supermarket {{as part of the}} redevelopment. The maltings would be converted into retail and office space, alongside 220 apartments.|$|E

2500|$|The Master {{tried to}} use the Eye of Harmony to obtain {{a new set of}} <b>regenerations</b> before, in The Deadly Assassin. He was also offered a new set of <b>regenerations</b> by the Time Lords in The Five Doctors, but his {{continued}} quest for <b>regenerations</b> in later stories like Planet of Fire implies that he never received them. Later, however, he would be granted a new cycle, as confirmed in the 2007 episode [...] "The Sound of Drums".|$|R

25|$|Cumin is a cross-pollinator, i.e. the breeds {{are already}} hybrids. Therefore, methods used for {{breeding}} are in vitro <b>regenerations,</b> DNA technologies, and gene transfers. The in vitro cultivation of cumin allows {{the production of}} genetically identical plants. The main sources for the explants used in vitro <b>regenerations</b> are embryos, hypocotyl, shoot internodes, leaves, and cotyledons.|$|R

As part of this he took a role in Europe's largest urban <b>regeneration</b> project, proposing a mix of redevelopment and conservation of existing buildings, using this mixed method to create a design guide for the <b>regeneration</b> of the Isle of Dogs. In this position he also campaigned for the Docklands Light Railway and oversaw the exterior refurbishment of St George in the East.|$|E

5|$|Arguably {{the most}} sought-after lost episode is Episode 4 of the final William Hartnell serial, The Tenth Planet, which ends with the First Doctor's <b>regeneration</b> into the Second. The only portion of the episode still in existence, bar a few poor-quality silent 8mm clips, is the final 27 seconds, {{comprising}} the <b>regeneration</b> itself and a few seconds leading up to it. The sequence had been shown in a 1973 episode of Blue Peter, and was retained in that show's archive.|$|E

2500|$|The Doctor's first (Hartnell to Troughton), ninth (Hurt to Eccleston), and thirteenth (Smith to Capaldi) <b>regenerations</b> occur due {{to natural}} causes – {{in all three}} cases the Doctor shows {{increasing}} signs of age, and comments that his body is [...] "wearing a bit thin," [...] though in the First Doctor's case this is apparently exacerbated by the energy drain from Mondas. All of the other <b>regenerations</b> {{have been caused by}} external factors, such as radiation poisoning, infection or fatal injuries.|$|R

Even individual Time Lords {{have taken to}} selling their future <b>regenerations</b> to each other. Narvin is captured by suspicious government officials and has {{most or all of}} his <b>regenerations</b> siphoned out of him. Meanwhile, Romana meets a far less adventurous, alternate version of herself. This Romana never travelled with the Doctor, never regenerated and never got into politics. Instead she got married and raised an adventurous son.|$|R

5|$|Central Salford is {{the eastern}} part of the {{district}} and comprises seven wards: Broughton, Claremont, Irwell Riverside, Kersal, Ordsall, Langworthy and Weaste & Seedley. This is the more urban half of the district and lies partly within the Manchester Inner Ring Road. Salford Quays lies within this area. Between 2005 and 2011, the Central Salford Urban <b>Regeneration</b> Company was responsible for urban <b>regeneration</b> in this area, securing over £1 billion of private sector investment. Social housing is provided by Salix Homes in this area.|$|E

5|$|Like much of British post-war planning, <b>regeneration</b> of Bristol {{city centre}} was characterised by large, cheap tower blocks, brutalist {{architecture}} {{and expansion of}} roads. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversed, with the closure of some main roads and the <b>regeneration</b> of the Broadmead shopping centre. In 2006 {{one of the city}} centre's tallest post-war blocks was torn down. Social housing tower blocks have also been demolished to be replaced by low rise homes.|$|E

2500|$|Subsequent <b>regenerations</b> {{retained}} {{essentially the}} same method, with or without additional video or make-up effects. The transition from the Fourth to the Fifth Doctor used an additional make-up effect representing a transitional form known as the Watcher, but aside from this, other <b>regenerations</b> in the original series run simply mixed {{the image of the}} incoming actor on top of the outgoing one. The transition from the Seventh to the Eighth Doctor in the 1996 television movie took advantage of the higher budget and modern computer animation technology to [...] "morph" [...] the features of Sylvester McCoy into those of Paul McGann.|$|R

The path of the journey consists of five temples which must be unsealed by Colette. On their journey, they meet Sheena Fujibayashi who comes from Tethe'alla, a world parallel to Sylvarant. She tells them about how the two worlds vie for each other's mana through the journey of <b>regeneration.</b>|$|E

5|$|Reformed Christians believe baptism to {{be a sign}} of <b>regeneration,</b> or {{the making}} of one into a new creature, based on the {{connection}} found in the New Testament between <b>regeneration</b> and washing with water. Baptism also represents forgiveness or remission of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, similarly to the sprinkling of blood of sacrificial animals. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect <b>regeneration,</b> even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. However, Reformed theologians do not teach that baptism is necessarily bound to the forgiveness of sins. Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism can be said to has had their sins forgiven. Rather, it is necessary that the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit.|$|E
