40|$|Rabbit thymus, appendix, {{blood and}} lymph nodes were {{characterized}} using immunological tests: rosette-forming ability with homologous or heterologous red blood cells, surface immunoglobulins, analytical cell-electrophoresis, cell <b>refringency</b> and in vitro mitogen responsiveness. The experiments {{were conducted on}} normal rabbits and cyclophosphamide-treated rabbits. Moreover, we tried to separate slow and high mobility cells by free-flow electrophoresis into fractions. These experiments suggest that rabbit lymphocyte behaviour is exceptional among mammals in {{that the majority of}} their lymphocytes appeared as B cells and that, in comparison with mouse and man, the proportions of these cells are inversed...|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} the {{morphological}} changes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae EC 1118 {{during the second}} fermentation of Spanish cava wines, in relation with progression of fermentation and aging. In the first stages of active fermentation, and associated {{with the increase in}} viable counts, budding cells and a relative homogeneity in cell size were observed. Close to the moment of sugar exhaustion cells acquired the morphology of stationary phase, to finally enter in a death phase with cell size reduction, and cytoplasm alterations including inhomogeneity, <b>refringency,</b> and detachment of the cell wall. At the beginning of this step structures reminiscent to autophagosomes are observed. This is in accordance with the appearance of molecular markers of autophagy described elsewhere in similar winemaking conditions.
