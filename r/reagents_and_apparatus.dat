This {{is evidenced by}} the foundation of the British Lichen Society which came into being some time ago, and now runs its own journal, The Lichenologist. The present book is another example, and it certainly appears at an appropriate time. The book which is written in clear and simple language contains a few introductory chapters (on the structure of lichens, the use of <b>reagents</b> <b>and</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and on the ecology), keys to orders and families, a descriptive part, a bibliography, a glossary, and an index, followed by the plates...|$|E

40|$|Summary: We {{determined}} {{the concentration of}} free fatty acids in 51 plasma samples by three different meth-ods: a gas-liquid Chromatographie, a colorimetric and an enzymatic method. Values obtained by the three methods show a good correlation. The gas-liquid Chromatographie method was used äs the reference method. The results of the enzymatic method are about 5 % too high and the colorimetric results have a bias of + 27 %. The coefficients of Variation of the three assays are 4, 7 and 5 % respectively. Storage of the samples at — 18 °C gives {{no change in the}} total amount of free fatty acids, enzymatically deter-mined. Because of low costs (time, <b>reagents</b> <b>and</b> <b>apparatus),</b> combined with a sufficient accuracy and precision, the enzymatic method for the determination of total free fatty acids is the method of choice.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for thinning localized regions in GaP for examination by means of transmission electron microscopy. A jet of chlorine in methanol was used to chemically polish slices from the P (l l l) face. To thin specimens from the Ga (l l l) face the same <b>reagent</b> <b>and</b> <b>apparatus</b> were used, but a voltage was applied so that the specimen was anodic with respect to an electrode inserted in the jet. In this case the surface was free from etch pits, but yellowish surface films were formed which could be removed by a short chemical polish. GaP is optically transparent, {{but if it is}} i l luminated only with wavelengths for which it has a sufficiently large absorption coeffi-cient, it can be arranged that significant transmission of light begins only when the material is thin enough for electron transmission. This l ight can be de-tected by a photomultiplier and the resultant signal used to automatically terminate the thinning. The principles of this method are discussed, and the equipment required for its util ization is described. Large transparent area...|$|R

40|$|Anew {{method for}} the in vitro {{screening}} of plant extracts with potential angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity is proposed. The method {{is based on}} the cleavage of the substrate hippuryl-glycyl-glycine by ACE and subsequent reaction with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid to form 2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl-glycyl-glycine, whose absorbance is determined at 415 nm in a microtitre plate reader. Rabbit lung dehydrated by acetone was employed as an enzyme source. Validation of the method showed satisfactory intra-day (CV ¼ 7. 63 %) and inter-day precision (CV ¼ 13. 61 %), recovery (97 – 102. 1 %), sensitivity (IC 50 ¼ 14. 1 nmol/l) and linearity in the range 7. 5 – 120 mmol/l of glycyl-glycine (r 2 ¼ 0 : 9921). Besides, the method showed good correlation with a HPLC assay already established for the screening of ACE inhibitors (r ¼ 0 : 9935 and 0 : 9034; respectively, for captopril solutions and for plant extracts).

40|$|XIDATION OF ORGANIC MATERIAL as a {{preliminary}} to determination of iodine, whether by wet or dry methods, entails loss of iodine if in-sufficient organic matter is present during the reaction (1, 2, 3). In blood serum, the organic content suffices {{to prevent this}} loss when the amount of iodine in the specimen is in the range found in physiological or patho-logical sera, 0 - 30 pg. / 100 ml., as has been repeatedly shown in recovery experiments (4, 5, 6, 7). When the iodine content of serum exceeds 500 ig. / 100 ml., as is sometimes the case after administration of iodinated radiopaque media, or other contact with iodinated medication, iodine may be volatilized in the ashing stage of the analysis, to be reabsorbed in other tubes. Such cross-contamination invalidates the entire series of tests, with loss of analyst’s time and delay of reports. To avoid delays caused {{by the presence of}} such cross-contaminators, a simple method of screening them out in advance was desirable. In connection with the quantitative dry-ashing procedure in use in this laboratory (7), the cross-contaminator exclusion test described below has proven satisfactory. It requires only 1 drop of serum, and adds no more than 30 minutes of operating time to a series of 20 - 40 PBI deter-minations. <b>REAGENTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>APPARATUS</b> * 4 N Sodium carbonate in dropper bottle.

40|$|The methods most {{commonly}} employed for {{the estimation of}} blood glucose are dependent upon the ability of glucose to reduce alkaline copper solutions. Reagents containing phosphomolybdic acid are then frequently used to form a blue com-plex by combination with the reduced copper. All these methods suffer the disadvantage that the final colour fades at such a rate as to imperil its accu-rate comparison with a standard glucose solution similarly treated. Fading was neither very apparent nor of much importance when visual colorimeters were em-ployed with direct comparison of standard and unknown colours. Folin (1929) first recorded the existence of fading and described a method to combat it. Interest was aroused by the general adoption of the photoelectric colorimeter, and many technical modifications were introduced to circumvent fading. These were remarkable for their variety rather than for their success in routine use. In the present investigation the factors influenc-ing fading have been determined and a new modifi-cation of the Folin and Wu technique has been evolved which simplifies the standard technique {{at the same time}} as it eliminates fading. Although the Folin and Wu (1920) method was chosen for this investigation the principles involved are applicable to other methods of blood glucose esti-mation in which similar reagents are used. <b>Reagents</b> <b>and</b> <b>Apparatus</b> Analar grade materials were used in the prepara-tion of all reagents.

40|$|The Division of Educational Programs (DEP) at Argonne National Laboratory-East {{interacts with}} the {{education}} community at all levels to improve science and mathematics education and to provide resources to instructors of science and mathematics. DEP conducts {{a wide range of}} educational programs and has established an enormous audience of teachers, both in the Chicago area and nationally. DEP has brought microscale chemistry to the attention of this huge audience. This effort has been supported by the U. S. Department of Energy through the Environmental Management Operations organization within Argonne.

40|$|Simplified {{chemical}} {{screening tests}} and an apparatus to facilitate their performance {{have been developed}} for porphyrins. The tests are applicable to urine, stool, and blood. The procedures for different specimens are essentially identical and can be performed in a few minutes with a minimum of <b>reagents</b> <b>and</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Results obtained are usually sufficiently definitive to permit differential diagnoses of por-phyrias and porphyrinurias without resort to separation or quantitation of the individual porphyrins. IAGNOSIS of the various diseases of porphyrin metabolism, the porphyrias, and porphyrinurias frequently requires knowledge of pos-sible abnormal porphyrin levels in three specimens: urine, stool, and blood. Fortunately, quantitative information beyond the fact that porphyrin levels are significantly above normal is rarely necessary. For this reason, appropriate porphyrin screening tests will suffice in diagnosing most cases where there is a defect in porphyrin metabolism. Many screening tests have been published (1 - 6); however, in most cases they are applicable to a single type of specimen. Moreover, these tests are in some cases complex or cumbersome, requiring a variety of reagents, a relatively intense ultraviolet light source, and routinely must be viewed in darkened areas of the laboratory. Tn most routine laboratories, porphyrin assays are performed infrequently and by personnel having limited experience with this type of assay. This report describes a basic porphyrin screening test that is ap-plicable to urine, stool, and blood, and presumably any other biologic material that one may wish to examine.

Additional Keyphraees: gel filtration transferrinasAl carrier in plasma trace elements toxicology Aluminum in plasma usually increases during hemodial-ysis, apparently against a concentration gradient (1 - 3), {{which is consistent with}} the metal being bound by protein. Reports (4, 5) that 60 to 80 % of the Al in plasma is associated with the large molecules support this view. It is now clear Al interacts with transferrin in plasma (6 - 8), but it has also been suggested (7, 9) that there is substantial binding to albumin. The high concentration of albumin in plasma as compared with that of transferrin makes it important to determine the relative roles of these (and any other) proteins as carriers of the metal. Here, we have used gel-filtration techniques to obtain strong evidence that transferrin is the sole protein carrier of Al in the plasma of maintenance-dialysis patients. Methods Al in fractionated plasma: Plasma sampled after dialysis from three maintenance-hemodialysis patients was pooled, diluted 10 -fold with buffer, then concentrated to two-thirds its original volume by use of Amicon UM 2 membranes.

40|$|Human {{exposure}} to bisphenol A (BPA) is ubiquitous, {{yet there are}} concerns about whether BPA {{can be measured in}} human blood. This Round Robin was designed to address this concern through three goals: 1) to identify collection materials, <b>reagents</b> <b>and</b> detection <b>apparatuses</b> that do not contribute BPA to serum; 2) to identify sensitive and precise methods to accurately measure unconjugated BPA (uBPA) and BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G), a metabolite, in serum; and 3) to evaluate whether inadvertent hydrolysis of BPA-G occurs during sample handling and processing. Four laboratories participated in this Round Robin. Laboratories screened materials to identify BPA contamination in collection and analysis materials. Serum was spiked with concentrations of uBPA and/or BPA-G ranging from 0. 09 - 19. 5 (uBPA) and 0. 5 - 32 (BPA-G) ng/mL. Additional samples were preserved unspiked as 'environmental' samples. Blinded samples were provided to laboratories that used LC/MSMS to simultaneously quantify uBPA and BPA-G. To determine whether inadvertent hydrolysis of BPA metabolites occurred, samples spiked with only BPA-G were analyzed for the presence of uBPA. Finally, three laboratories compared direct and indirect methods of quantifying BPA-G. We identified collection materials <b>and</b> <b>reagents</b> that did not introduce BPA contamination. In the blinded spiked sample analysis, all laboratories were able to distinguish low from high values of uBPA and BPA-G, for the whole spiked sample range and for those samples spiked with the three lowest concentrations (0. 5 - 3. 1  ng/ml). By completion of the Round Robin, three laboratories had verified methods for the analysis of uBPA and two verified for the analysis of BPA-G (verification determined by: 4 of 5 samples within 20 % of spiked concentrations). In the analysis of BPA-G only spiked samples, all laboratories reported BPA-G was the majority of BPA detected (92. 2 - 100 %). Finally, laboratories {{were more likely to be}} verified using direct methods than indirect ones using enzymatic hydrolysis. Sensitive and accurate methods for the direct quantification of uBPA and BPA-G were developed in multiple laboratories and can be used for the analysis of human serum samples. BPA contamination can be controlled during sample collection and inadvertent hydrolysis of BPA conjugates can be avoided during sample handling...|$|R
