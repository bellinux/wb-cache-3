40|$|We report {{continuing}} {{investigations into}} practical {{applications of the}} ac Josephson effect {{as the basis for}} a voltage-tunable <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>oscillator.</b> We have previously demonstrated experimentally that useful power levels (10 s of nW) and linewidths of a few kHz can be achieved in the heterodyne output from a High-Temperature-Superconducting Resistive SQUID (HTS-RSQUID) operating in the frequency range 1 - 50 MHz. Those results were achieved with 2 -junction R-SQUIDs incorporating current-biased shunt resistors of a few micro-ohms. We have now modified the fabrication procedures, and adjusted the shunt resistors and bias current values so that higher frequencies can be achieved. The Josephson junctions are of step-edge type, rather than the bi-crystal type used in our earlier work. The step-edge technique permits much more flexibility in the geometrical lay-out and utilizes the more cost-effective single-crystal MgO substrates.

40|$|An {{opto-electronic}} <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> that {{is based}} on forward scattering by the guided acoustic modes of a standard single-mode optical fiber is proposed and demonstrated. An optical pump wave is used to stimulate narrowband, resonant guided acoustic modes, which introduce phase modulation to a co-propagating optical probe wave. The phase modulation is converted to an intensity signal at the output of a Sagnac interferometer loop. The intensity waveform is detected, amplified, and driven back to modulate the optical pump. Oscillations are achieved at a frequency of 319 MHz, which matches the resonance of the acoustic mode that provides the largest phase modulation of the probe wave. Oscillations at the frequencies of competing acoustic modes are suppressed by at least 40 dB. The linewidth of the acoustic resonance is sufficiently narrow to provide oscillations at a single longitudinal mode of the hybrid cavity. Competing longitudinal modes are suppressed by at least 38 dB as well. Unlike other opto-electronic oscillators, no radio-frequency filtering is required within the hybrid cavity. The frequency of oscillations is entirely determined by the fiber opto-mechanics...|$|E

However, to-date, the development of industrially attractive prototypes has been hampered by the inability to identify systems which can provide enough power. Here, we demonstrate that microwave signals with device-compatible output power levels can be generated from a single magnetic tunnel junction with a lateral size of 100 nm, seven orders of magnitude smaller than conventional <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>oscillators.</b> We find that in MgO magnetic tunnel junctions the perpendicular torque induced by the spin-polarized current on the local magnetization can reach 25 % of the in-plane spin-torque term, while exhibiting a different bias-dependence.

40|$|What we call “nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance ” (NMR) was developed simultaneously but independently by Edward Purcell and Felix Bloch in 1946. The experimental method and theoretical interpretation they developed {{is now called}} “continuous-wave NMR ” (CWNMR). A different experimental technique, called “pulsed NMR ” (PNMR), was introduced in 1950 by Erwin Hahn. Pulsed NMR is used in {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI). Purcell and Bloch won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952 for NMR; more recently NMR {{was the subject of}} Nobel Prizes in Chemistry in 1991 and 2002. We have both NMR setups in the advanced labs: one is a variation of the CWNMR method, and the other is a pulsed NMR system. The physics underlying NMR is the same for both the continuous and pulsed methods, but the information obtained may be different. Certainly, the words used to describe what is being done in the experiments are different: in the continuous-wave case one tunes a <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> to “beat ” against the resonance of a nuclear magnetic moment in a magnetic field; in the pulsed case, one applies a sequence of RF pulses called π-pulses (180 degree pulses) or π/ 2 -pulses (90 degree pulses) and looks for “free induction decay ” and “spin echoes”. Below, we give a very simplified introduction, based on classical ideas, to the physics of NMR. More thorough discussions, focusing on the CWNMR technique, may be found in in the books by Preston and Dietz [1] and Melissinos [2] (see references). In particular, the chapter in Preston and Dietz gives a nice description of the connection between quantum-mechanical and semiclassical approaches to NMR physics. For a comprehensive treatment of NMR, see the book by Slichter [3]. 1. 1 Semiclassical ideas To observe NMR, one needs nuclei with a non-zero angular momentum I and magnetic moment µ. The relationship between these two quantities is where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. µ = γI, (1) A simple classical calculation would give γ = q/ 2 M, where q is the charge of the nucleus and M is its mass. But quantum mechanics requires this dimensionally correct result to be modified. In practice, we specify γ in units of the nuclear magneton µn ≡ e¯h/ 2 mp times a dimensionless factor g called the “spectroscopic splitting factor ” (often just “g factor”) : γ = gµ...|$|E

The phase noise of the remote signal caused by temperature and mechanical stress variations on the fiber is compensated by a high-precision phase-correction system, which is achieved using a single sideband modulator to transfer the phase correction from intermediate frequency to radio frequency, thus enabling accurate phase control of the 10 GHz signal. The residual phase noise of the remote 10. 03 GHz signal is measured to be − 70 dBc∕Hz at 1 Hz offset, and long-term stability of less than 1 × 10 − 16 at 10, 000 s averaging time is achieved.

40|$|Oscillators {{operating}} in field applications {{are subject to}} much more strenuous environmental effects {{than those in the}} laboratory. These environmental effects, such as vibration and temperature fluctuation, have a great impact on the performance of the oscillators; however, many applications require this laboratory-level performance in situ. Opto-electronic oscillators (OEOs) have emerged in recent years as excellent low-noise sources that rival the best <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>oscillators</b> over broad offset frequencies. An OEO is a delay-line oscillator based on a long optical fiber wound on a spool. The OEO uses an RF-modulated optical signal transmitted down a long fiber-optic cable as a high-Q RF frequency discriminator. OEOs hold promise for many field applications requiring very low noise levels to maintain a high level of precise timing. The phase modulated (PM) noise of these OEOs at offset frequencies below 1 kHz is dominated by environmental effects such as temperature and vibration.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{mechanism}} and a related device concept for a robust, magnetic field tunable <b>radio-frequency</b> (rf) <b>oscillator</b> using the self oscillation of a magnetic domain wall {{subject to a}} uniform static magnetic field and a spatially non-uniform vertical dc spin current. The self oscillation of the domain wall is created as it translates periodically between two unstable positions, one being in the region where both the dc spin current and the magnetic field are present, and the other, being where only the magnetic field is present. The vertical dc spin current pushes it away from one unstable position while the magnetic field pushes {{it away from the}} other. We show that such oscillations are stable under noise and can exhibit a quality factor of over 1000. A domain wall under dynamic translation, not only being a source for rich physics, is also a promising candidate for advancements in nanoelectronics with the actively researched racetrack memory architecture, digital and analog switching paradigms as candidate examples. Devising a stable rf oscillator using a domain wall is hence another step towards the realization of an all domain wall logic scheme.

40|$|In {{multiple}} antenna systems, {{phase noise}} due to instabilities of the <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>oscillators,</b> acts differently {{depending on whether}} the RF circuitries connected to each antenna are driven by separate (independent) local oscillators (SLO) or by a common local oscillator (CLO). In this paper, we investigate the high-SNR capacity of single-input multiple-output (SIMO) and multiple-output single-input (MISO) phase-noise channels for both the CLO and the SLO configurations. Our results show that the first-order term in the high-SNR capacity expansion is the same for all scenarios (SIMO/MISO and SLO/CLO), and equal to 0. 5 (ρ), where ρ stands for the SNR. On the contrary, the second-order term, which we refer to as phase-noise number, turns out to be scenario-dependent. For the SIMO case, the SLO configuration provides a diversity gain, resulting in a larger phase-noise number than for the CLO configuration. For the case of Wiener phase noise, a diversity gain of at least 0. 5 (M) can be achieved, where M is the number of receive antennas. For the MISO, the CLO configuration yields a higher phase-noise number than the SLO configuration. This is because with the CLO configuration one can obtain a coherent-combining gain through maximum ratio transmission (a. k. a. conjugate beamforming). This gain is unattainable with the SLO configuration. Comment: IEEE Transactions on Communication...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of mass spectrometry (MS) instruments starting in the late 19 th century, more and more research emphasis {{has been put on}} MS related subjects, especially the instrumentation and its applications. Instrumentation research has led modern mass spectrometers into a new era where the MS performance, such as resolving power and mass accuracy, is close to its theoretical limit. Such advanced performance releases more opportunities for scientists to conduct analytical research that could not be performed before. This thesis reviews general MS history and some of the important milestones, followed by introductions to ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) technique and quadrupole operation. Existing electronic designs, such as Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) preamplifiers (for ion signal detection) and <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>oscillators</b> (for ion transportation/filtering) are reviewed. Then the potential scope for improvement is discussed. Two new FT-ICR preamplifiers are reported; both preamplifiers operate at room temperature. The first preamplifier uses an operational amplifier (op amp) in a transimpedance configuration. When a 18 -k feedback resistor is used, this preamplifier delivers a transimpedance of about 85 dB, and an input current noise spectral density of around 1 pA/ p Hz. The total power consumption of this circuit is around 310 mW when tested on the bench. This preamplifier has a bandwidth of fi 3 kHz to 10 MHz, which corresponds to the mass-to-charge ratio, m/z, of approximately 18 to 61 k at 12 T for FT-ICR MS. The transimpedance and the bandwidth can be adjusted by replacing passive components such as the feedback resistor and capacitor. The feedback and bandwidth limitation of the circuit is also discussed. When using an 0402 type surface mount resistor, the maximum possible transimpedance, without sacrificing its bandwidth, is approximated to 5. 3 M. Under this condition, the preamplifier is estimated to be able to detect 110 charges. The second preamplifier employs a single-transistor design using a different feedback arrangement, a T-shaped feedback network. Such a feedback system allows 100 -fold less feedback resistance at a given transimpedance, hence preserving bandwidth, which is beneficial to applications demanding high gain. The single-transistor preamplifier yields a low power consumption of 5. 7 mW, and a transimpedance of 80 dB in the frequency range between 1 kHz and 1 MHz (m/z of around 180 to 180 k for a 12 -T FT-ICR system). In trading noise performance for higher transimpedance, an alternative preamplifier design has also been presented with a transimpedance of 120 dB in the same frequency range. The previously reported room-temperature FT-ICR preamplifier had a voltage gain of about 25, a bandwidth of around 1 MHz when bench tested, and a voltage noise spectral density of 7. 4 nV/ p Hz. The bandwidth performance when connecting this preamplifier to an ICR cell has not been reported. However, from the transimpedance theory, the transimpedance preamplifiers reported in this work will have a bandwidth wider by a factor of the open-loop gain of the amplifier. In a separate development, an oscillator is proposed as a power supply for a quadrupole mass filter in a mass spectrometer system. It targets a stabilized output frequency, and a feedback control for output amplitude stabilization. The newly designed circuit has a very stable output frequency at 1 MHz, with a frequency tolerance of 15 ppm specified by the crystal oscillator datasheet. Within this circuit, an automatic gain control (AGC) unit is built for output amplitude stabilisation. A new transformer design is also proposed. The dimension of the quadrupole being used as a mass filter will be determined in the future. This circuit (in particular the transformer and the quadrupole connection/mounting device) will be finalised after the design of the quadrupole. Finally, this thesis concludes with a discussion between the gain and the noise performance of an FT-ICR preamplifier. A brief analysis about the correlation between the gain, cyclotron frequency, and input capacitance is performed. Future work is also suggested for extending this research...|$|R
40|$|Advancing today's very {{rudimentary}} nanodevices toward functional nanosystems {{with considerable}} complexity and advanced performance imposes enormous challenges. This thesis presents {{the research on}} ultra-high frequency (UHF) nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) in combination with low-noise technologies that enable single-molecule mass sensing and offer promises for NEMS-based mass spectrometry (MS) with single-Dalton sensitivity. The generic protocol for NEMS resonant mass sensing is based on real-time locking and tracking of the resonance frequency as it is shifted by the mass-loading effect. This has been implemented in two modes: (i) creating an active self-sustaining oscillator based on the NEMS resonator, and (ii) a higher-precision external oscillator phase-locking to and tracking the NEMS resonance. The first UHF low-noise self-sustaining NEMS oscillator has been demonstrated by using a 428 MHz vibrating NEMS resonator as the frequency reference. This stable UHF NEMS oscillator exhibits 0. 3 ppm frequency stability and 50 zg (1 zg= 10 ^- 21 g) mass resolution with its excellent wideband-operation (0. 2 MHz) capability. Given its promising phase noise performance, the active NEMS oscillator technology also offers important potentials for realizing NEMS-based <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) local <b>oscillators,</b> voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), and synchronized oscillators and arrays {{that could lead to}} nanomechanical signal processing and communication. The demonstrated NEMS oscillator operates at much higher frequency than conventional crystal oscillators and their overtones do, which opens new possibilities for the ultimate miniaturization of advanced crystal oscillators. Low-noise phase-locked loop (PLL) techniques have been developed and engineered to integrate with the resonance detection circuitry for the passive UHF NEMS resonators. Implementations of the NEMS-PLL mode with generations of low-loss UHF NEMS resonators demonstrate improving performance, namely, reduced noise and enhanced dynamic range. Very compelling frequency stability of 0. 02 ppm and unprecedented mass sensitivity approaching 1 zg has been achieved with a typical 500 MHz device in the narrow-band NEMS-PLL operation. Retaining high quality factors (Q's) while scaling up frequency has become crucial for UHF NEMS resonators. Extensive measurements, together with theoretical modeling, have been performed to investigate various energy loss mechanisms and their effects on UHF devices. This leads to important insights and guidelines for device Q-engineering. The first VHF/UHF silicon nanowire (NW) resonators have been demonstrated based on single-crystal Si NWs made by bottom-up chemical synthesis nanofabrication. Pristine Si NWs have well-faceted surfaces and exhibit high Q's (Q 13100 at 80 MHz and Q 5750 at 215 MHz). Given their ultra-small active mass and very high mass responsivity, these Si NWs also offer excellent mass sensitivity in the 10 ? 50 zg range. These UHF NEMS and electronic control technologies have demonstrated promising mass sensitivity for kilo-Dalton-range single-biomolecule mass sensing. The achieved performance roadmap, and that extended by next generations of devices, clearly indicates realistic and viable paths toward the single-Dalton mass sensitivity. With further elaborate engineering, prototype NEMS-MS is optimistically within reach. </p...|$|R
