40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the extrusion characteristics of magnesium alloy (AZ 31), a computer simulation was attempted. Tensile properties of as-cast billet with different strain rates were incorporated into the simulation. The results showed a great change in distribution of stress and strain at near die region by the <b>ram</b> <b>travel.</b> It {{was found that the}} average gain size at longitudinal edge of the extruded sheet was smaller than that at center region, which might be attributed to recrystallization caused by severe plastic deformation...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy is {{currently}} investigating alternative sorbents {{for the removal}} and immobilization of radioiodine from the gas streams in a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. One of these new sorbents, Ag 0 -functionalized silica aerogels, shows great promise as a potential replacement for Ag-bearing mordenites because of its high selectivity and sorption capacity for iodine. Moreover, a feasible consolidation of iodine-loaded Ag 0 -functionalized silica aerogels to a durable SiO 2 -based waste form makes this aerogel an attractive choice for sequestering radioiodine. This report provides a preliminary assessment of the methods {{that can be used}} to consolidate iodine-loaded Ag 0 -functionalized silica aerogels into a final waste form. In particular, it focuses on experimental investigation of densification of as prepared Ag 0 -functionalized silica aerogels powders, with or without organic moiety and with or without sintering additive (colloidal silica), with three commercially available techniques: 1) hot uniaxial pressing (HUP), 2) hot isostatic pressing (HIP), and 3) spark plasma sintering (SPS). The densified products were evaluated with helium gas pycnometer for apparent density, with the Archimedes method for apparent density and open porosity, and with high-resolution scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) for the extent of densification and distribution of individual elements. The preliminary investigation of HUP, HIP, and SPS showed that these sintering methods can effectively consolidate powders of Ag 0 -functionalized silica aerogel into products of near-theoretical density. Also, removal of organic moiety and adding 5. 6 mass% of colloidal silica to Ag 0 -functionalized silica aerogel powders before processing provided denser products. Furthermore, the <b>ram</b> <b>travel</b> data for SPS indicated that rapid consolidation of powders can be performed at temperatures below 950 °C...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Rams</b> <b>travel</b> to Kansas City to {{face their}} in-state rival {{and the first}} of four AFC West opponents of the season, the Chiefs. Things would get ugly for the Rams as more {{injuries}} continue to pile up as both offensive lineman Jake Long and wide receiver Brian Quick suffered season-ending knee and shoulder injuries, respectively. With the loss, the Rams are 0-1 against AFC West opponents.|$|R
5000|$|Players often accused Steel {{of saving}} his best {{performances}} {{for when the}} <b>Rams</b> <b>travelled</b> down to play the London teams. He was further disliked for his [...] "moonlighting", though {{in the days of}} the maximum wage for footballers he could hardly be blamed. But he received payments for articles that he wrote for several newspapers, enabling him to have a more luxurious life style than his teammates.|$|R
50|$|Following their conference opener against UNC Wilmington, the Rams played {{three more}} non-conference games to close out 2011. At their December 20 home game, the Rams posted a 68-49 {{victory over the}} UAB Blazers. Following the victory over the Blazers, the <b>Rams</b> <b>travelled</b> to games at UNC Greensboro and Akron, winning each affair. The December 29 victory at Akron was the Rams' first {{overtime}} game and victory of the season.|$|R
50|$|With Chris Long and Shaun Hill out, the <b>Rams</b> <b>travel</b> to Tampa Bay {{looking to}} rebound from the blowout home loss against Minnesota. The game saw Austin Davis get first start. Most {{of the game}} was delayed due to {{lightning}} and thunder after the game was tied to 7. Rams kicker Greg Zurelien nailed a last minute field goal to give the Rams a close 19-17 victory, giving them their first win of the season, {{with a record of}} one game tied apiece.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Rams</b> <b>travel</b> to San Diego, facing {{their third}} AFC West opponent, the Chargers. The Rams looked to go 2-1 against AFC West opponents, but couldn't flick the switch this time {{thanks to the}} Chargers' Philip Rivers' late game heroics and the defense, who intercepted a pass from Shaun Hill, who {{attempted}} a game-winning touchdown pass. With the 27-24 loss, this gave the Rams a 1-2 record against all AFC West opponents. Rams fans, who attended the game, were seen holding up signs involving a possible return to Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|Raja Ram (born Ronald Rothfield, 18 December 1941) is an Australian-born {{musician}} {{and the owner}} of the United Kingdom record label Tip World. Ram left Australia in the 1950s to begin the hippie trail. He returned to Australia later and studied flute at the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music. <b>Ram</b> <b>travelled</b> to New York in 1965 to study jazz. He was {{a founding member of the}} psychedelic rock band Quintessence in the late 1960s and early 1970s, playing at the first two Glastonbury Festivals (then 'fayres') in 1970 and 1971.|$|R

50|$|Back in his {{hometown}} of Thanjavur, Ram's Uncle Bahsyahm and Aunt Vasanthato urge him to remarry. He is then married to the daughter of family friends, Mythili (Vasundhara Das). While his wedding is being celebrated across the village, Ram tells his childhood friends Vedha and Yegham that he has no reason to be happy since the world's biggest political divorce is going on with the separation of Pakistan in the north. During his first night, he learns that Mythili, like her family, are supporters of Gandhi and that the Mahatma will be visiting Calcutta a few days later on the anniversary of the bloody riots. <b>Ram</b> <b>travels</b> to Calcutta alone and learns that a Mr. Nair now lives at his old apartment. Nair gives him a goddess painting drawn by Aparna not long before her death. Later that night, Ram joins a mob that confronts Gandhi and Suhrawardy, then Chief Minister of Bengal, about the bloody riots. When questioned whether they take full responsibility for the riots, both of them accept and ask for forgiveness. The mob forgives them, but Ram refuses to.|$|R

50|$|He is {{credited}} with changing the Ramsnehi Sampradaya to a more contemporary one. Till 1972, all Ramsnehi saints followed the founder's dictum to travel exclusively on foot. Ram Kishor, on the earnest request of devotees, started travelling by car and plane. This enabled a wider reach for the Sampradaya in India as well as abroad. <b>Ram</b> Kishor <b>travelled</b> to Bangkok, Singapore, Malaya, Australia and Fiji for spreading Indian culture and teachings of Ram Charan Maharaj.He initiated the setting up of temporary centres of Ramsnehi Sampradaya at the Kumbh Melas at Ujjain, Prayag and Haridwar.|$|R

In addition, Roy petitioned the King to increase his allowance and perquisites. He was successful in persuading the British government to increase the stipend of the Mughal Emperor by £30,000. He also visited France. While in England, he embarked on a sort of cultural exchange, meeting with members of Parliament and publishing books on Indian economics and law. Sophia Dobson Collet was his biographer at the time.|$|R
5000|$|Lord Ram {{told the}} queen {{that he was}} happy with her prayers and she could ask for a boon, at which the queen asked Ram to come with her in child form to Orchha. Ram agreed to go but he put forth three conditions: “I will travel only in Pukh Nakshatra. When Pukh Nakshatra will end I will stop and resume only when Pukh Nakshatra sets in again. In this manner I will travel from Ayodhya to Orchha on foot along {{with a group of}} sages. Secondly, once I reach Orchha, I will be the King of Orchha and not your husband. Thirdly, (since the child form of <b>Ram</b> would <b>travel</b> in the queen’s lap), the first place you seat me will be my final place of stay and will be famous by the name of Ramraj." [...] The Queen agreed and started her journey to Orchha with baby Ram in her lap. Since the queen {{travelled}} only in Pukh Nakshtra it took 8 months and 27 days for the queen to reach Orchha from Ayodhya on foot (between 1574 and 1575).|$|R

The device is installed on a tool table of an open-die forging press as easy as ordinary dies. Thereat, the lower case of the device is fixed to the tool table and always remains stationary while the upper case {{is attached to the}} press <b>ram</b> and always <b>travels</b> along with it.
