40|$|Phenol-formaldehyde {{adhesives}} {{are important}} adhesives {{known to have}} superior water resistance capacity and high mechanical strength when utilized in wood-based applications. Due to unsustainability and environmental issues {{associated with the use}} of fossil fuels, there is an urgent need to look for alternative raw materials, which are renewable in nature. Pinyon-juniper biomass has been found to be a suitable replacement for petroleum-based phenol because it is renewable, abundant, and readily available. In this thesis, bio-oil produced from the pyrolysis of pinyon-juniper biomass using red mud alumina catalyst was used to produce wood adhesives. The characterization of pinyon-juniper bio-oil showed the presence of phenolics, aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, ethers, ketones, aldehydes, and aliphatic alcohols. Resol synthesis parameters such as formaldehyde-to-phenol molar ratio (1. 8 and 2), catalyst loading (0. 25, 0. 63, and 1. 25 g of NaOH), reaction time (60 minutes), and reaction temperature (95 °C), were investigated in the production of pinyon-juniper adhesives. Based on the results obtained, the extent of phenol substitution with pinyon-juniper bio-oil was dependent on the amount catalyst used during the synthesis process. The maximum phenol substitution of 80 % was achieved using a catalyst loading of 1. 25 g of NaOH while the minimum phenol substitution of 50 % was obtained at a catalyst loading of 0. 25 g of NaOH.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Determination by {{thermomechanical}} analysis (TMA) of {{the average}} num-ber of degrees of freedom of polymer segments between crosslinking nodes of phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin-hardened networks indicate that additive-accelerated PF resin polycondensations and hardening presented several different acceleration mecha-nisms. Some additives such as sodium carbonate appear to present purely an accelera-tion effect on the polycondensation reaction. Other additives such as propylene carbon-ate appear to present an acceleration effect by also inducing {{an increase in the}} average functionality of the system, due to alternate crosslinking reactions to which the acceler-ator itself does participate, leading to a tighter final network. These alternate crosslink-ing reactions can be of a different nature. In the propylene carbonate case, the reaction is related to a Kolbe–Schmitt reaction.

40|$|The focused {{influence}} on the rheological characteristics of highly-concentrated mineral suspensions used in the building industry is possible due to the directed synthesis of nano-sized macromolecules that have the certain structure and high adsorbing capacity {{on the surface of}} mineral particles and that are able to modify the boundary layer composition. The adsorbing capacity of organic compounds depends mostly on the hydrocarbon chain length and the molecular weight of the compound. The result of the condensate interaction of phenol and its derivatives with aldehydes is oligomers and polymers whose structure depends on the phenol functionality, the kind of aldehyde, molecular ration of reagents, the Ph medium of the reaction. So, changing the type or the functionality of initial monomers or the synthesis conditions one can produce linear thermoplastic oligomers (novolacs) or highly branched thermosetting oligomers (<b>resols).</b> It has been found that the resole production takes place under softer conditions, and there is no necessity to neutralize reaction products as with novolac production that usually requires acid environment.

30|$|Numerous {{investigations}} {{of the behavior of}} PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymers in aqueous solutions and the adsorption of these copolymers at solid-liquid interfaces were carried out in the past decades [31, 52, 142]. Also, since the aggregated structure of PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymers is controlled depending on temperature, concentration, and the addition of additives, they have been used as structure-directing organic materials for the synthesis of inorganic materials with a controlled size, shape and structure. Bagshaw et al. prepared mesoporous silica molecular sieves using nonionic polyethylene oxide surfactants in a neutral condition [143]. The hydrogen bonding between the hydrophilic part of polymers and the inorganic precursor followed by molecular rearrangement involving the amphiphilic nature of polymers was the key factor for the preparation of this material. Zhao et al. reported on the synthesis of mesoporous silica structures using nonionic alkyl poly(oxyethylene) surfactants and poly(alkylene oxide) block copolymers in an acid media, which included cubic, three-dimensional hexagonal, two-dimensional hexagonal, and lamellar mesostructures [144]. Kim et al. developed an economical and simple method for the preparation of sub-micrometer hematite particles with a narrow size distribution and an isotropic shape. To obtain hematite particles, the ferric ion solution was aged at an elevated temperature in the presence of poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) triblock copolymer EO 20 PO 70 EO 20 (P 123). The resulting particles also show a disordered mesoporous structure and retain their shape after calcinations [145]. Huang et al. synthesized a series of highly ordered mesoporous carbonaceous frameworks with diverse symmetries by using phenolic <b>resols</b> as a carbon precursor and mixed amphiphilic surfactants of poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) and reverse PPO-PEO-PPO as templates by the strategy of evaporation-induced organic-organic self-assembly [146]. The blends of block copolymers can interact with resol precursors and tend to self-assemble into cross-linking micellar structures during the solvent evaporation process, which provides a suitable template for the construction of mesostructures. An understanding of the organic-organic self-assembly behavior in the mixed amphiphilic surfactant system would pave the way for the synthesis of mesoporous materials with controllable structures.|$|E

40|$|Nanostructures {{of countless}} {{materials}} {{have been studied}} extensively over the past decades for their interesting and highly tunable properties that go far beyond their characteristics in the bulk. While the variety of reported nanostructures, morphologies, and porosities is vast, little is still understood regarding the structure-property relationships for nanomaterials in energy storage. Furthermore, the potentials of multi-component nanohybrids, including complete nanodevices, are not fully explored. Block copolymer structure direction of inorganic nanomaterials provides a synthetic pathway for precise control over many relevant parameters. In this thesis, the highly tunable synthesis of ordered mesoporous carbons from the self-assembly and structure direction of triblock terpolymers and phenolic <b>resols</b> is described. The tailorability of porosity, pore size, surface area, chemical composition, and morphology by design is demonstrated, including two different gyroidal carbons. These mesoporous carbon materials {{with a wide range}} of characteristics are employed in a structure-property relationship study as sulfur hosts in lithium-sulfur batteries. This methodological investigation demonstrates the beneficial impact of microporosity and low carbonization temperature, which influences the chemical composition of the carbon material, on cyclability and capacity retention of carbon-sulfur composite cathodes. To extend the idea of three-dimensionally ordered multi-component nanomaterials that combine and potentially enhance the functionality of its individual components, atomic layer deposition is investigated towards its applicability on nanoporous materials. It is shown that a conformal, nanometer thin titanium dioxide coating on gyroidal mesopores can be achieved over microns in deposition depth on free-standing carbonaceous substrates. The obtained ordered gyroidal mesoporous core-shell hybrid exhibit triplefunctionality with a graphitized carbon core, crystallized anatase-titania shell, and a continuous mesoporous phase. With the inclusion of a third solid phase in the gyroidal architecture the complexity of ordered multicomponent nanostructures is further increased. The "total synthesis" of a 3 D-nanointegrated allsolid-state battery is described using almost entirely polymer based processing and materials. Freestanding gyroidal mesoporous carbon is used as the anode of a lithium ion battery and coated with an ultra-thin polymer electrolyte through self-limiting electropolymerization.

40|$|The {{forestry}} {{sector in}} New Zealand {{ranks as the}} third largest export earner. The individual industries within the forestry sector have, in some cases, grown up {{on the basis of}} institutionalised knowledge, sometimes without a full understanding of the underlying fundamental physico-chemical relationships and the changes that occur during wood material processing. At the same time the commercial pressures of operating within the forestry sector have resulted in demand for more uniform, high quality, fit-for-purpose product, faster throughput and less downgrade from what is becoming a lower quality feedstock as harvest ages decline. In the 21 st century, the forestry sector is being transformed into an "engineered ligno-cellulosic materials processor" and this in turn is requiring a more sophisticated knowledge of the material feedstock and the processes involved in wood products manufacture. The aim of this work was to use magnetic resonance techniques to explore aspects of ligno-cellulosic materials processing at points along the value-added process chain, namely drying, chemical modification (preservation) and re-engineering (gluing) of wood products. Magnetic resonance mini-imaging studies of the water transport during the drying of radiata pine boards rave shown differences in the directional movement of water within the wood structure. These effects show a dependence on the surface area to volume ratio of timber and the orientation of the annual rings with respect to the larger drying face. Narrow, flat-sawn boards exhibit anomalous drying behaviour in terms of water mass transport, whereas thicker boards display more conventional core-shell drying behaviour. These restrictions to flow have been further investigated using diffusion tensor imaging via a modified pulsed field gradient spin-echo sequence to elucidate the nature of anisotropic diffusion in wood. The direction of least restriction to self-diffusion is in the longitudinal direction, as would be expected with it being the direction of active transport within a tree stem, whereas the direction of greatest restriction to self-diffusion is in the radial direction, with the higher density latewood acting as a barrier. Preservation of radiata pine sapwood with novel boron-based preservatives has been investigated using magnetic resonance imaging to determine the penetration and retention of the incipient compounds. An apparent anomaly in retention for trimethylborate-treated Pinus radiata sapwood was investigated by 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy of excised sections of latewood and earlywood, which showed hydrolytic decomposition of trimethyl borate to form boric acid. The rate of hydrolysis of trimethylborate was monitored by 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy and was shown to occur very rapidly in the latewood (within 24 hours), and over a longer time scale of several days in the earlywood. The resulting publication has reported some of the first published 11 B MRI images. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has provided (in conjunction with separate mass spectrometry studies) mechanistic evidence for the accelerated curing of phenol-resorcinol formaldehyde <b>resols,</b> using ammonia in combination with the conventional paraformaldehyde hardener - a process known as GreenWeldTM. Carbon- 13 and nitrogen- 15 NMR spectroscopy has shown evidence of both benzylamine and aniline type bridging structures formed during cure, compared to only methylene structures being formed under conventional curing conditions. Poly(vinyl acetate) emulsion polymer adhesive has also been examined using NMR spectroscopic methods, with particular focus on the effect of addition of aluminium chloride, which is often commercially added to PVAc formulations as a crosslinking agent. Multinuclear magnetic resonance spectra obtained during the cure of AlCl 3 modified PV Ac adhesive, shows a low frequency 27 Al shift of ca. 3 ppm suggesting a local change in environment as the aluminium changes from a solvated to a covalently bonded octahedral environment. Finally, as a preliminary study, a new device for measuring uniaxial extension of visco-elastic solids was trialled on poly(vinyl acetate) hydrogels to study the effect of addition of aluminium chloride on the visco-elastic properties of the adhesive. A similar, manually operated device was used to obtain NMR spectroscopic data during compression of the gel. These studies have shown that addition of aluminium chloride as a crosslinking agent, in fact produces a cured adhesive with fewer crosslinks than the corresponding unmodified adhesive, but with increased resistance to shear-induced creep...|$|E
