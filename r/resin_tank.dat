40|$|Pultrusion {{process is}} a {{continuous}} and efficient process producing composite profiles with a constant cross-section. During pultrusion, the fibre reinforcements are saturated with the resin in a <b>resin</b> <b>tank</b> and then continuously pulled through a heated die by a puller. External electrical heaters are used for heating of the die in conventional pultrusion technology. Inside the die, the resin gradually cures and solidifies to form a composite part with the same cross-section profile as in the die. Two numerical techniques based on the finite element method {{have been developed for}} a simulation of the conventional pultrusion processes. The first uses the general purpose finite element software ANSYS Mechanical, the second is quite new and specialized on the fluid dynamic finite element software ANSYS CFX. The developed techniques have been validated by using the experimental and numerical results demonstrating a distribution of the temperature and degree of cure along the control line of pultured profile and published in open literature...|$|E
50|$|Most {{raceways}} {{are made}} of reinforced concrete, though some earthen raceways are also built. Earthen raceways with plastic liners cost little and are easy to build, but cleaning and disinfecting them is difficult and plastic linings are fragile. Reinforced concrete is more expensive, but is durable and can be shaped in complex ways. Raceway tanks can also be built from polyester <b>resin.</b> These <b>tanks</b> have smooth walls, and are mobile and easy to service. However, their cost limits them to small sizes, under 5 cubic metres.|$|R
40|$|A lightweight, {{high-pressure}} {{cryogenic tank}} construction includes an inner layer comprising {{a matrix of}} fiber and resin suitable for cryogenic use. An outer layer in intimate contact with the inner layer provides support of the inner layer, and is made of <b>resin</b> composite. The <b>tank</b> is made by placing a fiber preform on a mandrel and infusing the preform with the resin. The infused preform is then encapsulated within the outer layer...|$|R
40|$|It {{is under}} continual attack from {{hydraulic}} shock, chlorine and chloramines degradation, fouling (particulate and organic), oxidation, osmotic shock from the regeneration process and basic attrition from backwash. Over its lifetime, resin oxidizes, loses capacity and simply backwashes down the drain. All these external {{forces at work}} on resin beads adversely affect how resin functions (Figure 1). In addition, less <b>resin</b> in the <b>tank</b> means fewer functional groups to attract hardness ions, creating reduced capacity. Resin ages, as does everything and, therefore, system capacity diminishes over time. Understanding the conditions affecting resin helps troubleshooters find solutions to otherwis...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} cesium sorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherm tests with resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) <b>resin</b> using <b>Tank</b> AN- 105 simulated waste. These tests were conducted at the Savannah River Technology Center {{in support of the}} Hanford River Protection Project - Waste Treatment Plant (RPP-WTP). A crucial part of the current treatment process involves the removal of cesium from waste tank supernate solutions using columns containing SuperLig 644 resin. Due to concerns about the chemical and hydraulic performance of SuperLig 644 resin in large-scale operations, RF resin was evaluated as a potential alternative to the baseline material. Extensive testing was conducted at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory on various RF samples (both granular and spherical) obtained from different vendors. Three RF samples (two spherical and one granular) were subsequently delivered to SRTC based on initial screening results at PNNL, which indicated good performance for these materials. A small number of tests were then conducted at SRTC on the RF resin using non-radioactive simulant solutions to support development of a preliminary column performance model...|$|R
40|$|Microstereolithography (MSL) {{is rapidly}} {{developing}} technique for micro-fabrication. Vector-by-vector scanning MSL has a potential to create true 3 D micro-devices {{as compared to}} mostly planar (2 D- 21 / 2 D) devices fabricated by conventional MEMS techniques. Previous literature shows two different scanning methods :(1) Galvanomirror scanning, (2) Photoreactor tank scanning. Galvanomirror scanning technique has higher fabrication speed but poor resolution because of defocusing of laser spot on the <b>resin</b> surface. Photo-reactor <b>tank</b> scanning has higher resolution but produces a wavy structures and limited speed of fabrication. This paper proposes and develops an offaxis lens scanning technique for MSL and carries out optical analysis to compare its performance with the existing techniques mentioned above. The comparison clearly demonstrates improved performance with the proposed offaxis lens scanning technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of time and temperature on the mechanical property of hardness of a polycarbonate (thermoplastic) matrix, to achieve an 80 % glass loading to a 20 % wet-out for the polycarbonate pre-impregnated rod, to develop the prototype pultrusion equipment for polycarbonate pre-impregnated rod, and to develop the prototype pulforming equipment for polycarbonate fibersteel composite rod. Fibersteel rod is composed of seven pre-impregnated rods twisted into a spiral shape to act as a substitute for steel reinforcement rod in concrete;A polycarbonate matrix which had been solvent treated was tested according to Rockwell Hardness Test (ASTM 785). An 80 % glass loading was achieved by implementing a <b>resin</b> wet-out <b>tank,</b> which contains rollers designed to spread and submerge fibers in a polycarbonate/solvent solution. Percent of glass loading was obtained according to Ignition Test (ASTM 2584). Prototype pultrusion and pulforming equipment was designed and built at Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa;There were significant differences among all different temperature and speed combinations for the Rockwell Hardness on the polycarbonate matrix. An 80 % glass loading was achieved for long glass fiber embedment in a polycarbonate pre-impregnated rod. Processing parameters have been established for both the pultrusion and pulforming processes...|$|R
5000|$|The tracks, {{wheels and}} {{suspension}} of a tank {{are outside the}} armoured hull and {{are some of the}} most vulnerable spots. The easiest way to disable a tank (other than a direct hit in a vulnerable area with a full-power anti-tank weapon) is to target the tracks for a [...] "mobility kill" [...] (m-kill), or target all external visual aids with rubbery cohesive substances such as melted rubber or blackened high viscosity epoxy <b>resins.</b> Once a <b>tank</b> is disabled it is easier to destroy. This is why side-skirts are an important feature; they can deflect heavy machine-gun bullets and trigger the detonation of HEAT rounds before they strike the running gear. Other vulnerable parts of a typical tank include the engine deck (with air intakes, radiators, etc.) and the turret ring, where the turret joins the hull.|$|R
40|$|The {{reactivity}} of melamine-urea-formaldehyde resins is of key {{importance in the}} manufacture of engineered wood products such as medium density fibreboard (MDF) and other wood composite products. Often the MDF manufacturing plant has little available information on the resin reactivity other than details of the resin specification at the time of batch manufacture, which often occurs off-site at a third-party resin plant. Often too, fresh resin on delivery at the MDF plant is mixed with variable volume of aged <b>resin</b> in storage <b>tanks,</b> thereby rendering any specification of the fresh resin batch obsolete. It is therefore highly desirable to develop a real-time, at-line or on-line, process analytical technology to monitor the quality of the resin prior to MDF panel manufacture. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been calibrated against standard quality methods and against 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measures of molecular composition in order to provide at-line process analytical technology (PAT), to monitor the resin quality, particularly the formaldehyde content of the resin. At-line determination of formaldehyde content in the resin was made possible using a six-factor calibration with an R 2 (cal) value of 0. 973, and R 2 (CV) value of 0. 929 and a root-mean-square error of cross-validation of 0. 01. This calibration was then used to generate control charts of formaldehyde content at regular four-hourly periods during MDF panel manufacture in a commercial MDF manufacturing plant...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{identification}} using effluents backflushed from exhausted {{urban and}} rural <b>tank</b> <b>resins</b> and cleaned resins containing the sulfonated copolymer of styrene and divinylbenzene (SDB) were completed, along with microbial assessment of the concentrated stock salt brine. Forty-four different bacterial and fungal genera were identified. Extensive biochemical and animal virulence tests completed {{on one of the}} six bacterial salt brine isolates indicated a pathogenic staphylococcal strain. The retention of Staphylococcus aureus, a Flavobacterium sp, and Escherichia coli B bacteriophage was demonstrated both by using the nonexhausted sodium-regenerated resin and by using the same resin exchanged with different mono-, di-, and trivalent cations. Effluent counts completed after bacterial seepage through the resins indicated the Pb++ exchanged resin removed 55 % of the bacteria; Na+, Fe++, and Al+++ removed 31 to 36 % and Ca++ and Cu++ removed about 10 to 15 %. Seventy per cent or more of the bacteriophage was removed by Fe++, Cu++, and Al+++, whereas the Ca++ and Na++ cations removed 25 to 31 %. Over a 77 -day period, nonsterile tap water was passed through bacterial seeded and uninoculated SDB (Na) resin columns. Effluent and resin elution counts demonstrated the growth and survival of 2 different bacteria per column. Increased bacterial retention, survival, and multiplication occurred concomitantly with accumulation of organic and inorganic materials and the Ca++ and Mg++ cations from the tap water. Furthermore, microbial elution from resin particles taken from column depths of 1, 8, and 16 cm indicated a bacterial diminution with increasing depths...|$|R
40|$|The marine sub-tropic {{climate of}} Hawaii is {{particularly}} {{suited to the}} use of semi-contained hydraulic lysimeters. Field experiences in the use of these lysimeters reveal a number of problems among which were factors related to the unusual tropical crops of pineapple and sugarcane. This project investigated the modification of the lysimeters to minimize some of these problems. Modular planting schemes in 1. 52 meter rows or beds and tillage depths of 0. 3 to 0. 6 meters dictated minimal lysimeter size. The great height and lodging of the cane required a large lysimeter area to help in the definition of the effective transpiring area. Polyester <b>resin</b> fiberglass reinforced <b>tanks,</b> 3 x 3 x 1. 52 m deep with paper honeycomb strengthened bottoms were designed to meet the need for a large and relatively deep container of minimal weight. The prevalence of high relative humidities necessitated the use of engineering graph paper to reduce distortion of recording traces from shrinkage and swelling of the paper. Despite the limited diurnal and annual temperature variations, careful insulation of the exposed portions of the manometer was necessary. The regular diurnal changes in wind velocity imposed fluctuations on the open-end manometer used for recording the pressure changes in the hydraulic load cells that were offset by venting near ground level. Nylon reinforced butyl rubber irrigation hose with the ends clamped was used to form the bolsters for the load cells. A silicone rubber sealant was used to ensure water tight fittings with standard copper tubing connectors to the bolsters. Stability against rolling was achieved by placing some of the bolsters at right angles to the others. Large tensiometers of perforated polyvinyl pipe covered with porous Porvic membrane were designed to induce suction {{at the base of the}} soil column. The water release curves for the Latosols suggested a 0. 1 bar suction for an approximation of field capacity. U. S.

5000|$|The UV {{life of a}} part is {{dependent}} upon UV additive level and type as well as part thickness and design, pigment type, level and effectiveness of dispersion, processing conditions and the geographic location where the molded part is used (see Figure 3). It is important when comparing resin UV performanceto ensure that the testing {{has been done on}} a consistent basis. In Figure 1, accelerated weathering data is presented. Generally, 2,000 hours corresponds to 1 year in Florida and 1,400 hours to 1 year in Southern Canada. Often terms like “UV-8” are used. UV-8 means the material can withstand 8,000 hours in a Xenon Ci-65 weatherometer. UV-2 or UV-4 would mean 2,000 or 4,000 hours respectively. Hence, UV-8 corresponds to approximately 4 years of continuous outdoor exposure in Florida. It is important to understand which weatherometer, i.e. Carbon Arc or Xenon, was used, as well as the details of how the weatherometer was run. ASTM D-2565 is the recognized standard. Testing can be performed using actual outdoor weathering exposure, such as Florida and Arizona, to confirm this data. Note Figure 1 uses the industry standard criteria of when the sample has reached less than 50% of its original break elongation to determine the end of the test. In most cases useful life of the part extends beyond this point. All samples in Figure 1 are nonpigmented as supplied by Exxon Chemical. The UV performance test data can be found on our data sheets for each specific grade.Light Stability CharacteristicsUltraviolet (UV) Stabilization Plastics are attacked and deteriorate when exposed to direct sunlight. When plastic tanks absorb the sun’s ultraviolet light, the UV energy excites the polymers’chains, causing them to break. The effects are discoloration, embrittlement and eventual cracking. Elevated temperatures and oxygen tend to accelerate the deterioration. Tanks listed as suitable for outdoor service are protected from UV attack by: coloring or pigmenting and/or adding internal stabilizers which preferentially absorb or dissipate the UV energy. Shading tanks from the sun will also prevent deterioration. Tanks must be free to expand or contract, avoid excessive tension on the tank. For assistance in selecting the appropriate tank for a specific application, see the <b>Tank</b> <b>Resin</b> Selector Guides with reputable resin manufacturers.Resources being published by [...] siting additional references to AVENGENERAL ISOLINES OF GLOBAL RADIATION AND THERE EFFECTS ON POLYMERSYears = 70 x UV Rating (Your Location’s Isoline) (from Figure 3)Example: Natural Part, Molded Properly, Using UV-8 Additive Package For Use in Floridai.e.Florida= 140 Kcal/cm@2/yr.
