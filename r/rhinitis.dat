5|$|Many {{people with}} Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} {{have experienced the}} {{signs and symptoms of}} an infection in the 3–6 weeks prior to the onset of the neurological symptoms. This may consist of upper respiratory tract infection (<b>rhinitis,</b> sore throat) or diarrhea.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of {{bacteria in the}} stomach may be beneficial, reducing the prevalence of asthma, <b>rhinitis,</b> dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and esophageal cancer by influencing systemic immune responses.|$|E
5|$|Allergic symptoms, {{including}} <b>rhinitis,</b> conjunctivitis, and asthma, {{have been}} documented in laboratory animal workers who {{come into contact with}} guinea pigs. Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander. People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well. Allergy shots can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.|$|E
25|$|Azelastine is a potent, second-generation, selective, {{histamine}} antagonist (histamine-H1-receptor antagonist) {{used as a}} {{first line}} therapy of mild intermittent, moderate/severe intermittent and mild persistent <b>rhinitis</b> (new classification system for <b>rhinitis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Ragweed pollen is {{notorious for}} causing {{allergic}} reactions in humans, specifically allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> Up {{to half of}} all cases of pollen-related allergic <b>rhinitis</b> in North America are caused by ragweeds.|$|E
25|$|Before a {{diagnosis}} of allergic disease can be confirmed, other possible causes of the presenting symptoms should be considered. Vasomotor <b>rhinitis,</b> for example, {{is one of many}} maladies that shares symptoms with allergic <b>rhinitis,</b> underscoring the need for professional differential diagnosis. Once {{a diagnosis}} of asthma, <b>rhinitis,</b> anaphylaxis, or other allergic disease has been made, there are several methods for discovering the causative agent of that allergy.|$|E
25|$|Azelastine {{nasal spray}} is {{indicated}} {{for the local}} treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic <b>rhinitis</b> and perennial allergic <b>rhinitis,</b> such as rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal pruritus in adults and children 5 {{years of age and}} older. In some countries, it is also indicated for the treatment of vasomotor <b>rhinitis</b> in adults and children ≥ 12 years old. Azelastine eyes drops are indicated for the local treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis.|$|E
25|$|Pseudoephedrine is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of nasal congestion, sinus congestion and Eustachian tube congestion. Pseudoephedrine is also indicated for vasomotor <b>rhinitis,</b> and as an adjunct to other agents in the optimum treatment of allergic <b>rhinitis,</b> croup, sinusitis, otitis media, and tracheobronchitis.|$|E
25|$|Meta-analyses {{have found}} that {{injections}} of allergens under the skin is effective in the treatment in allergic <b>rhinitis</b> in children and in asthma. The benefits may last for years after treatment is stopped. It is generally safe and effective for allergic <b>rhinitis</b> and conjunctivitis, allergic forms of asthma, and stinging insects.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids {{marketed as}} anti-inflammatories are often topical formulations, such as nasal sprays for <b>rhinitis</b> or inhalers for asthma. These {{preparations}} {{have the advantage}} of only affecting the targeted area, thereby reducing side effects or potential interactions. In this case, the main compounds used are beclometasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide. In <b>rhinitis,</b> sprays are used. For asthma, glucocorticoids are administered as inhalants with a metered-dose or dry powder inhaler.|$|E
25|$|Combinations of {{the same}} drugs are useful in non-allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> These {{medications}} can be very useful in controlling the nasal congestion problem.|$|E
25|$|Allergic and vasomotor <b>rhinitis</b> – inflammations of the mucous {{membrane}} {{of the nose}} caused by an allergen, and caused by circulatory and nervous system disorders.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{signs are}} {{extremely}} variable, and diagnosis can be severely delayed {{due to the}} nonspecific nature of the symptoms. In general, <b>rhinitis</b> is the first sign in most people.|$|E
25|$|Acne-form {{dermatitis}} {{and other}} forms of skin disease may also be seen, as well as mucous hypersecretion in the lungs. Asthma and <b>rhinitis</b> may worsen. Rarely, tongue disorder, aphten, bad breath, and obstipation occur.|$|E
25|$|Underlying disease must be {{controlled}} to prevent exacerbation and worsening of ABPA, {{and in most}} patients this consists of managing their asthma or CF. Any other co-morbidities, such as sinusitis or <b>rhinitis,</b> should also be addressed.|$|E
25|$|Acupuncture {{seems to}} be safe in people getting anticoagulants, {{assuming}} needles are used at the correct location and depth. Studies are required to verify these findings. The evidence suggests that acupuncture might be a safe option for people with allergic <b>rhinitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Utilizing a sinus {{rinse and}} nasal {{irrigation}} are well accepted for the temporary relief {{of the symptoms}} associated with allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> The mechanism of action is actual flushing of the allergens from the nasal and sinus passages with large volume saline irrigation.|$|E
25|$|A 31-year-old woman {{went to her}} {{physician}} {{because of}} decreased vision in her left eye. The left eye showed fibrinous exudates, posterior synechiae and vitritis. After a vitreous sample {{was sent to the}} lab for identification, the yeast was identified as Sporobolomyces salmonicolor. The recommended treatment was voriconazole 200mg, twice a day for two months. Improvement in the left eye was seen within a week. Exposure to mould and yeast within a military hospital in Finland lead to an outbreak of asthma, alveolitis and <b>rhinitis.</b> The building was known to have severe water and mould damage. After performing inhalation provocation tests, four cases of asthma caused by Sporobolomyces salmonicolor were reported. An additional seven workers were diagnosed with <b>rhinitis.</b> All seven individuals with <b>rhinitis</b> acted positively in nasal S.salmonicolor provocation tests. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor was recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid of three patients in a hospital, one of whom was a kidney transplant recipient. Heavy growth of S.salmonicolor was recovered from utility rooms on the floors of each patient, and from the hospital rooms of two patients. It was suggested that this particular case was most likely caused by contamination. During the collection process, S.salmonicolor was most likely introduced into the CSF as a contaminant.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} {{also supports}} {{the use of}} sublingual immunotherapy for <b>rhinitis</b> and asthma but it is less strong. For seasonal allergies the benefit is small. In this form the allergen is given under the tongue and people often prefer it to injections. Immunotherapy is not recommended as a stand-alone treatment for asthma.|$|E
25|$|Cidoxepin {{is under}} {{development}} by Elorac, Inc. {{for the treatment}} of chronic urticaria (hives). As of 2017, it is in phase II clinical trials for this indication. The drug was also under investigation {{for the treatment of}} allergic <b>rhinitis,</b> atopic dermatitis, and contact dermatitis, but development for these indications was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|House dust mites are {{associated}} with allergic <b>rhinitis</b> and asthma. Efforts to remove these mites from the environment have not {{been found to be}} effective. Immunotherapy may be useful in those affected. Subcutaneous injections have better evidence than under the tongue dosing. Topical steroids as nasal spray or inhalation may be used.|$|E
25|$|L. paracasei is a {{constituent}} in the therapeutic, nutritional treatment VSL#3. This proprietary, standardized, formulation of live bacteria {{may be used}} in combination with conventional therapies to treat ulcerative colitis. A systematic review provided significant evidence of beneficial clinical and immunologic effects of Lactobacillus paracasei LP-33 strains in the treatment of Allergic <b>rhinitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{activity}} {{for the first}} time may set the stage for an associated asthma attack or may aggravate pre-existing asthma. Intense emotional stimuli during sexual intercourse can lead to autonomic imbalance with parasympathetic over reactivity, thereby causing release of mast cell mediators that can provoke postcoital asthma and / or <b>rhinitis</b> in these patients.|$|E
25|$|For chronic {{sinusitis}} {{it can be}} an effective add-on therapy. It is also reported to be an effective measure against chronic sinus symptoms induced by work-place exposure to sawdust. Further evidence suggests that nasal irrigation causes relief for both hay-fever and the common cold. Nasal irrigation could also be an effective treatment for allergic <b>rhinitis</b> and {{chronic sinusitis}}.|$|E
25|$|IgE {{also has}} an {{essential}} role in type I hypersensitivity, which manifests in various allergic diseases, such as allergic asthma, most types of sinusitis, allergic <b>rhinitis,</b> food allergies, and specific types of chronic urticaria and atopic dermatitis. IgE also plays a pivotal role in responses to allergens, such as: anaphylactic drugs, bee stings, and antigen preparations used in desensitization immunotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Ragweed pollen is {{a common}} allergen. A single plant may produce about a billion grains of pollen per season, and the pollen is transported on the wind. It causes {{about half of all}} cases of pollen-associated {{allergic}} <b>rhinitis</b> in North America, where ragweeds are most abundant and diverse. Common culprits are common ragweed (A. artemisiifolia) and great ragweed (A. trifida).|$|E
25|$|Initial {{treatment}} {{is similar to}} atrophic <b>rhinitis,</b> namely keeping the nasal mucosa moist with saline or oil-based lubricants and treating pain and infection as they arise; adding menthol to lubricants may be helpful in ENS, as may be use of a cool mist humidifer at home. For people with anxiety, depression, or who are obsessed with {{the feeling that they}} can't breathe, psychiatric or psychological care may be helpful.|$|E
25|$|Sporobolomyces salmonicolor is {{generally}} interpreted to be a Biosafety Risk Group 1 fungus. It {{is considered an}} opportunistic fungal pathogen of immunocompromised individuals and {{has been reported in}} AIDS-related infections. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor has been associated with nasal polyps, lymphadenitis, bone marrow involvement in AIDS patients, infected skin, pseudomeningitis and a case of endophthalmitis. S.salmonicolor is also considered a type 1 allergen and has been known to cause asthma, nosocomial allergic alveolitis, and <b>rhinitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other meta-analyses include homeopathic {{treatments}} to reduce cancer therapy side-effects following radiotherapy and chemotherapy, allergic <b>rhinitis,</b> attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and childhood diarrhoea, adenoid vegetation, asthma, {{upper respiratory tract}} infection in children, insomnia, fibromyalgia, psychiatric conditions and Cochrane Library reviews of homeopathic treatments for asthma, dementia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, induction of labour, and irritable bowel syndrome. Other reviews covered osteoarthritis, migraines, postoperative ecchymosis and edema, delayed-onset muscle soreness, or eczema and other dermatological conditions.|$|E
25|$|Allergies are common. In the {{developed}} world, about 20% {{of people are}} affected by allergic <b>rhinitis,</b> about 6% of people {{have at least one}} food allergy, and about 20% have atopic dermatitis at some point in time. Depending on the country about 1–18% of people have asthma. Anaphylaxis occurs in between 0.05–2% of people. Rates of many allergic diseases appear to be increasing. Inhaled allergens can also lead to increased production of mucus in the lungs, shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse effects are {{flushing}} (e.g., warmth, redness, itching or tingling), headache, pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, <b>rhinitis,</b> pruritus and rash. These can be minimized by initiating therapy at low dosages, increasing dosage gradually, and avoiding administration {{on an empty}} stomach. High doses of niacin often temporarily reduce blood pressure {{as a result of}} acute vasodilation. In the longer term, high-dose niacin use may persistently lower blood pressure in individuals with hypertension, but {{more research is needed to}} determine the extent of this effect.|$|E
25|$|Azelastine is {{safe and}} well tolerated in both adults and {{children}} with allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> Bitter taste, headache, nasal burning and somnolence are the most frequently reported adverse events. US prescribing recommendations warn against the concurrent use of alcohol and/or other central nervous system depressants, but to date {{there have been no}} studies to assess the effects of azelastine nasal spray on the CNS in humans. More recent studies have shown similar degrees of somnolence (approx. 2%) compared with placebo treatment. The problem of bitter taste may be reduced by correct application of the nasal spray (i.e. slightly tipping the head forward and not inhaling the medication too deeply), or alternatively using the azelastine/sucralose formulation.|$|E
25|$|The three cysteinyl leukotrienes, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are potent bronchoconstrictors, increasers of {{vascular}} permeability in postcapillary venules, and stimulators of mucus secretion {{that are}} {{released from the}} lung tissue of asthmatic subjects exposed to specific allergens. They play a pathophysiological role in diverse types of immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Drugs that block their activation of the CYSLTR1 receptor viz., montelukast, zafirlukast, and pranlukast, are used clinically as maintenance treatment for allergen-induced asthma and rhinitis; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced asthma and <b>rhinitis</b> (see Aspirin-induced asthma); exercise- and cold-air induced asthma (see Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction); and childhood sleep apnea due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy (see Acquired non-inflammatory myopathy#Diet and Trauma Induced Myopathy). When combined with antihistamine drug therapy, they also appear useful for treating urticarial diseases such as hives.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from these}} ambient allergens, {{allergic}} reactions {{can result from}} foods, insect stings, and reactions to medications like aspirin and antibiotics such as penicillin. Symptoms of food allergy include abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, itchy skin, and swelling of the skin during hives. Food allergies rarely cause respiratory (asthmatic) reactions, or <b>rhinitis.</b> Insect stings, food, antibiotics, and certain medicines may produce a systemic allergic response that is also called anaphylaxis; multiple organ systems can be affected, including the digestive system, the respiratory system, and the circulatory system. Depending on the rate of severity, it can cause a skin reactions, bronchoconstriction, swelling, low blood pressure, coma, and death. This type of reaction can be triggered suddenly, or the onset can be delayed. The nature of anaphylaxis is such that the reaction can seem to be subsiding, but may recur throughout a period of time.|$|E
25|$|The dose-limiting {{side effects}} are liver damage, lung disease and immunosuppression. The most common side effects (occurring in >1% of those treated with it) are, in {{approximately}} descending order of frequency: diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, hair loss, high blood pressure, rash, nausea, bronchitis, headache, abdominal pain, abnormal liver function tests, back pain, indigestion, urinary tract infection, dizziness, infection, joint disorder, itchiness, weight loss, loss of appetite, cough, gastroenteritis, pharyngitis, stomatitis, tenosynovitis, vomiting, weakness, allergic reaction, chest pain, dry skin, eczema, paraesthesia, pneumonia, <b>rhinitis,</b> synovitis, cholelithiasis and shortness of breath. Whereas uncommon side effects (occurring in 0.1-1% of those {{treated with the}} drug) include: constipation, oral thrush, stomatitis, taste disturbance, thrombocytopenia and hives. Rarely (in 0.1% of those treated with it) it can cause: anaphylaxis, angiooedema, anaemia, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, vasculitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, severe infection, interstitial lung disease, cirrhosis and liver failure.|$|E
500|$|Other {{potential}} {{side effects}} include blurred vision, dry mouth, excessive grinding of the teeth, nosebleed, profuse sweating, <b>rhinitis</b> medicamentosa (drug-induced nasal congestion), reduced seizure threshold, and tics (a {{type of movement}} disorder).|group="sources"}} Dangerous physical side effects are rare at typical pharmaceutical doses.|$|E
