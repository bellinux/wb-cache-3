The <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> for many of these radionuclides have not yet been published. A collaboration of universities and national labs has taken on the task of calculating <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the rare radionuclides using the software package: DCAL. The working group developed a procedure for calculating <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> and a quality assurance (QA) program to verify the calculations completed. The first portion of this QA program was to verify that each participating group could independently reproduce the <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> for a known set of radionuclides. The second effort was to divide the group of radionuclides among the independent participants in a manner that assured that each radionuclide would be redundantly and independently calculated. The final aspect of this program was to resolve any discrepancies arising among the participants as a group of the whole. The output of the various software programs for six QA radionuclides, 144 Nd, 201 Au, 50 V, 61 Co, 41 Ar, and 38 S were compared among all members of the working group. Initially, a few differences in outputs were identified. This exercise identified weaknesses in the procedure, which have since been revised. After the revisions, <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> were calculated and compared to published <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> with good agreement. The present efforts involve generating <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the rare radionuclides anticipated to be produced from the spallation neutron source should a mercury target be employed...|$|R

30|$|In {{radiological}} protection, it {{is important}} to be able to perform valid calculations of the absorbed dose in organs and tissues of the body for persons exposed to external radiation sources and radiation from internally distributed radionuclides. Computer programs are needed because it is difficult to measure the absorbed dose to organs and tissues. For radionuclides entering the body by inhalation and ingestion in occupational and environmental exposures, the Dose and Risk Calculation (DCAL) [1] program has been used to derive nuclide-specific <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> published by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). In addition, “Internal Dose Assessed by Computer” (IDAC-Dose) [2, 3] program has been used by ICRP to tabulate <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> for patients undergoing examinations with radiopharmaceuticals in nuclear medicine (mainly intravenous administration, sometimes orally or via inhalation). Similar programs have been developed by other groups (RADAR [4, 5], etc.). The ICRP Task Group on “Radiation dose to patients in diagnostic nuclear medicine” has issued several publications [6 – 9] on the absorbed dose to patients from different clinically used diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals using the IDAC-Dose 1.0 program. DCAL has been used by the ICRP Task Group on “Dose calculations” to estimate doses to occupationally exposed individuals and members of the public [10 – 15]. At that time, the absorbed dose calculations using DCAL and IDAC-Dose 1.0 were based on the stylised family anatomical phantoms described by Cristy and Eckerman [16] and based on the data given in ICRP Publication 23 for the “Reference Man” [17]. The stylised phantoms were described by linear and quadratic equations and included 24 specific organs. In IDAC-Dose 1.0, <b>radionuclide-specific</b> absorbed <b>dose</b> calculations were interpolated from monoenergetic photon-specific absorbed fractions (SAFs) between 10 and 4  MeV, and electrons were assumed to be locally absorbed.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{evaluate}} the potential dose distribution resulting from surface radioactivity, using occupational radiation exposure scenarios. The surface radioactivity clearance values considered in this analysis may ultimately replace those currently specified in the U. S.

The surface contamination values apply to radioactive contamination deposited on a surface (i. e., not incorporated into the interior of the material). For these calculations, the <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> for intake of radionuclides were taken from ICRP Publication 68 (ICRP 1994), and external exposure <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> were taken from the compact disc (CD) that accompanied Federal Guidance Report (FGR) 13 (Eckerman et al. 1999). The ICRP Publication 68 <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> were based on ICRP Publication 60 (ICRP 1990) and were used specifically for worker dose calculations.

To maintain consistency of lens dose assessment, in the present study we incorporated the ICRP- 116 detailed eye model into the converted polygon-mesh (PM) version of the ICRP- 110 reference phantoms. After the incorporation, the <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the eye lens were calculated and compared with those of the ICRP- 116 data. The results showed generally a good agreement between the newly calculated lens <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> and the values of ICRP 2010 Publication 116. Significant differences were found for some irradiation cases due mainly to the use of different types of phantoms. Considering that the PM version of the ICRP- 110 reference phantoms preserve the original topology of the ICRP- 110 reference phantoms, it is believed that the PM version phantoms, along with the detailed eye model, provide more reliable and consistent <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the eye lens.

The same biokinetic model for intravenous administration of 18 F-FDG was used in ICRP Publication 128 [9] with an effective <b>dose</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0.019  mSv/MBq. The absorbed doses for 99 mTc-pertechnetate in ICRP Publication 128 [9] {{are based on the}} biokinetic model presented in ICRP Publication 53 [6] and the SAF values on the previous stylised adult phantoms. For orally administered 99 mTc-pertechnetate, an effective <b>dose</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0.016  mSv/MBq was calculated using the sets of tissue weighting factors given in ICRP Publication 60 [15]. In this paper, the effective <b>dose</b> <b>coefficient</b> for the same procedure was estimated to be 0.014  mSv/MBq when using an updated biokinetic model, revised phantoms, updated tissue weighting factors, updated nuclear decay data, and a new computational framework. For oral administration with medium thyroid uptake of 131 I-iodide, the {{effective dose}} in ICRP Publication 128 [9] was estimated to be 22  mSv/MBq and, in this paper, using the same biokinetic model, the coefficient was estimated to be 16  mSv/MBq, which corresponds to a 28 % reduction. In general, is it not possible to determine explicitly which factor contributes most to the change in the coefficient. However, in the case for 131 I-iodide where 96.4 % of effective dose value arises from irradiation of the thyroid is the dominating factor for the effective dose reduction in the change of the tissue weighting factor for the thyroid from 0.05 in ICRP Publication 60 to 0.04 in ICRP Publication 103. The new calculation methods from more realistic anatomical and biokinetic models will provide more accurate absorbed dose results and probably allow more accurate estimations of the radiation-induced risk of stochastic effects to patients examined by nuclear medicine.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Dedicated breast CT prototypes used in {{clinical}} investigations utilize single circular source trajectory and cone-beam geometry with flat-panel detectors {{that do not}} satisfy data-sufficiency conditions and could lead to cone beam artifacts. Hence, this work investigated the glandular dose characteristics of a circle-plus-line trajectory that fulfills data-sufficiency conditions for image reconstruction in dedicated breast CT. METHODS: Monte Carlo-based computer simulations were performed using the GEANT 4 toolkit and was validated with previously reported normalized glandular <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> for one prototype breast CT system. Upon validation, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the normalized glandular <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> {{as a function of}} x-ray source position along the line scan. The source-to-axis of rotation distance and the source-to-detector distance were maintained constant at 65 and 100 cm, respectively, in all simulations. The ratio of the normalized glandular <b>dose</b> <b>coefficient</b> at each source position along the line scan to that for the circular scan, defined as relative normalized glandular <b>dose</b> <b>coefficient</b> (RD(g) N), was studied by varying the diameter of the breast at the chest wall, chest-wall to nipple distance, skin thickness, x-ray beam energy, and glandular fraction of the breast. RESULTS: The RD(g) N metric when stated as a function of source position along the line scan, relative to the maximum length of line scan needed for data sufficiency, was found to be minimally dependent on breast diameter, chest-wall to nipple distance, skin thickness, glandular fraction, and x-ray photon energy. This observation facilitates easy estimation of the average glandular dose of the line scan. Polynomial fit equations for computing the RD(g) N and hence the average glandular dose are provided. CONCLUSIONS: For a breast CT system that acquires 300 - 500 projections over 2 pi for the circular scan, the addition of a line trajectory with equal source spacing and constant x-ray beam quality (kVp and HVL) and mAs matched to the circular scan, will result in less than 0. 18 % increase in average glandular dose to the breast per projection along the line scan...|$|R
40|$|Carbon- 14, a {{radioactive}} nuclide, {{is used in}} many industrial applications. Due to {{its wide}} range of uses in industry, many workers {{are at risk of}} accidental internal exposure to 14 C. Being a low energy beta emitter, 14 C is not a significant external radiation hazard, but the internal consequences posed by 14 C are important, especially because of its long half life of 5730 years. The current biokinetic model recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) is a conservative estimate of how radiocarbon is treated by the human body. The ICRP generic radiocarbon model consists of a single compartment representing the entire human body. This compartment has a biological half life of 40 days yielding an effective <b>dose</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 5. 8 × 10 - 10 Sv Bq- 1. This overestimates the dose of all radiocarbon compounds that have been studied. 	An improved model has been developed that includes and alimentary tract, a urinary bladder, CO 2 model, and an "Other" compartment used to model systemic tissues. The model can be adapted to replicate any excretion curve and excretion pattern. In addition, the effective <b>dose</b> <b>coefficient</b> produced by the updated model is near the mean effective <b>dose</b> <b>coefficient</b> of carbon compounds that have been considered in this research. The major areas of improvement are: more anatomically significant, a less conservative <b>dose</b> <b>coefficient,</b> and the ability to manipulate the model for known excretion data. Due to the wide variety of carbon compounds, it is suggested that specific biokinetic models be implemented for known radiocarbon substances. If the source of radiocarbon is dietary, then the physiologically based model proposed by Whillans that splits all ingested radiocarbon compounds into carbohydrates, fats, and proteins should be used.

30|$|The reconstructed 90 Y PET voxels have {{a spatial}} {{resolution}} of approximately 10 to 12 mm at full width at half maximum. 90 Y radiation cross fire and beta dose spread {{were taken to}} be similar to the blurring of activity due to the partial volume effect of PET. Although the dose contribution by 90 Y bremsstrahlung may be assumed negligible within areas of 90 Y activity [26], we accounted for such bremsstrahlung losses in our voxel dosimetry by adjusting our absorbed <b>dose</b> <b>coefficient</b> by a factor of 0.995 based on Monte Carlo calculations. 90 Y dosimetric parameters used were as follows: half-life, 64.1 hours; energy per decay, 0.934 MeV [27]; absorbed <b>dose</b> <b>coefficient,</b> 49.59 Gy/GBq/kg; and soft tissue density, 1.04 g/cm 3. The dosimetry assumes no post-implantation redistribution of microspheres, leaching, nor destruction of microspheres in vivo. Dose distribution heterogeneity was limited {{to the size of the}} reconstructed voxels; true dose heterogeneity at the microscopic level was not assessed.|$|R
30|$|To {{calculate}} the absorbed doses to the blood, local energy deposition of all α- and β-particles of all progeny of Ra- 224 was assumed. The {{contribution of the}} γ-emission was neglected due to the low interaction probability in the small sample volume. Based on these assumptions, absorbed <b>dose</b> <b>coefficients</b> (in mGy∙kBq−[*] 1) for 1  h irradiation were determined for both the α- and the β-contribution to the absorbed dose to the blood.|$|R
