50|$|In 1881 the Corkickle Brake, an {{inclined}} wagonway 525 yd {{in length}} and with gradients of between 1 in 5.2 and 1 in 6.6 was built from the Furness Railway main line, a short distance {{to the south of}} Corkickle station, to the Earl of Lonsdale's Croft Pit. The 'brake' closed in 1931 due to the worsening financial situation of the colliery's owners, Lonsdale's Whitehaven Colliery Co. In May 1955, the incline was re-opened, this time to serve the factory of Marchon Products - a subsidiary of Albright and Wilson - at Kells. It was used mainly to haul <b>rail</b> <b>tanker</b> wagons containing sulphuric acid from the main line - by now in the ownership of British Railways - to the Marchon factory. The Corkickle Brake closed for good on 31 October 1986 and the task of transporting the acid and other chemicals was taken over by road tankers.|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands, the Betuweline is a {{dedicated}} freight railway. It will, among other things, {{be used for}} transportation {{of all kinds of}} hazardous materials from the Port of Rotterdam to the German Hinterland and vice versa. The line is approximately 150 km long. Alongside the line, over more than 100 km noise shields are apparent. The question is to what extent this noise shield hinders the cooling of a <b>rail</b> <b>tanker,</b> carrying flammable liquid such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) ? To answer this question, a full scale testwas conducted on an already constructed part of the Betuweline [N. Rosmuller, D. W. G. Arentsen, (2005). Praktijkproeven Betuweroute: Instantane uitstroming en koeling 24 juni 2005, Nibra, Arnhem, The Netherlands]. Two railcars and a <b>rail</b> <b>tanker</b> were placed behind a 3 m high noise shield. First, it was tested as to whether firemen or water canons should be used to deliver the water. Water canons were best next, four positions of the water canons to wet the <b>rail</b> <b>tanker</b> were tested. Three camera’s and three observers recorded the locations and the extent of water that hit the <b>rail</b> <b>tanker.</b> The results indicate that the noise shield, to a large extent, prevents thewater fromhitting, and therefore cooling, the <b>rail</b> <b>tanker.</b> The upper parts of the <b>rail</b> <b>tanker</b> were minimally struck by the water canons and the small amount of water flowing down the <b>rail</b> <b>tanker</b> did not reach the lower parts of it because of the armatures at the <b>rail</b> <b>tanker.</b> Also, the amount of water in the ditches to be used for wetting was too small. The ditch nearby ran empty. These insights are both relevant to emergency responders for disaster abatement purposes and towater management organizations. The Ministry of Transport is examining the possible strategies to deal with these findings. The results are based upon one single full scale test near a 3 m high noise shield. In addition, it would be valuable to determine what the influence would be of other heights of the noise shield...|$|E
5000|$|A Vaportight tank is a horizontal, atmospheric, {{crude oil}} storage tank. Vaportight tanks can {{hold up to}} 14.7 PSI and use that {{pressure}} to force gas vapors to a flare stack. Because Vaportight tanks allow no fugitive gas to escape they are classified as process equipment, therefore they can be spaced as such and are secondary containment exempt. This also allows them to be operated in situations with a high H2S content. Vaportight tanks also known as (Tornado type tanks, Positive Pressure Systems, and OSY Tanks) are frequently packaged with an integral separator package, flare stack, and all other equipment downstream of the wellhead to form a complete single well battery. Because of this Vaportight tank packages are a mostly used in the temporary production of oil wells. The intended use for Vaportight tank packages was sour oil production (as H2S gas is deadly in low concentrations) but with ease [...] The first vaportight tanks were constructed from used crude oil <b>rail</b> <b>tankers</b> by Tornado Technologies. Today's Vaportights are manufactured tanks which makes them a much lighter, easier to move alternative with more storage capacity.|$|R

50|$|The {{line between}} Gunzburg and Mindelheim has been {{threatened}} with closure several times, {{but it has}} always been averted. Between 1963 and 1998, a major reason for the preservation of the railway was that the southern section between Breitenbrunn and Mindelheim was used for the transport of oil by <b>rail</b> in <b>tankers</b> from the Bedernau oil field. General freight was closed in 1997. Passenger traffic is currently not threatened with closure, because the track has been modernised, reducing travel times and improving access to the main lines in Günzburg and Mindelheim.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{reduction of}} risk in LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) road transport due {{to the adoption of}} passive fire protections was investigated. Experimental data available for small scale vessels fully engulfed by a fire were extended to real scale road and <b>rail</b> <b>tankers</b> through a finite elements model. The results of mathematical simulations of real scale fire engulfment scenarios that may follow accidents involving LPG tankers proved the effectiveness of the thermal protections in preventing the "fired" BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion) scenario. The presence of a thermal coating greatly increases the "time to failure", providing a time lapse that in the European experience may be considered sufficient to allow the start of effective mitigation actions by fire brigades. The results obtained were used to calculate the expected reduction of individual and societal risk due to LPG transportation in real case scenarios. The analysis confirmed that the introduction of passive fire protections turns out in a significant {{reduction of risk}}, up to an order of magnitude in the case of individual risk and of about 50 % if the expectation value is considered. Thus, the adoption of passive fire protections, not compulsory in European regulations, may be an effective technical measure for risk reduction, and may contribute to achieve the control of "major accidents hazards" cited by the European legislation. © 2009 Elsevier B.

The line is approximately 150 km long. Alongside the line, more than 100 km noise shields have been constructed. The question is how, and to what extent, this noise shield will affect the pool shape and size of an instantaneous release of a flammable liquid, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). In case of an instantaneous release of liquid from a <b>rail</b> <b>tanker</b> (50 m 3), both risk analysts and emergency responders use a circular pool shape of about 600 m 2 would result. To assess the influence of a noise shield, a full scale test was conducted on an already constructed part of the Betuweline. A <b>rail</b> <b>tanker</b> was filled with 50 m 3 red-colored environmentally safe liquid. The liquid was instantaneously released. A very peculiar pool shape actually results due to the presence of a noise shield. A zone between the rails and the noise shield (2 m wide and 90 m long) is within 2 - 3 min filled with 15 cm of liquid. The total pool size area was about 750 m 2. Both shape and size deviate substantially from the traditional figures. These insights are both relevant to emergency responders for disaster abatement purposes and to risk analysts for effective modeling purposes. The Dutch Ministry of Transport is examining possible strategies to deal with these results. The results of this study are based upon one single instantaneous release test.

5000|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} is usually divided into three major components: upstream, midstream and downstream. The midstream sector involves the transportation (by pipeline, <b>rail,</b> barge, oil <b>tanker</b> or truck), storage, and wholesale marketing of crude or refined petroleum products. Pipelines and other transport systems can be used to move crude oil from production sites to refineries and deliver the various refined products to downstream distributors. Natural gas pipeline networks aggregate gas from natural gas purification plants and deliver it to downstream customers, such as local utilities.|$|R
50|$|Refineries {{which use}} {{a large amount}} of steam and cooling water need to have an {{abundant}} source of water. Oil refineries therefore are often located nearby navigable rivers or on a sea shore, nearby a port. Such location also gives access to transportation by river or by sea. The advantages of transporting crude oil by pipeline are evident, and oil companies often transport a large volume of fuel to distribution terminals by pipeline. Pipeline may not be practical for products with small output, and <b>rail</b> cars, road <b>tankers,</b> and barges are used.|$|R

North Dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by <b>tanker</b> <b>rail</b> car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price, and rail cars {{can be used to}} avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline {{in order to get the}} oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery.

40|$|Transportation is of key {{importance}} to the ethanol sector, with a typical 100 million gallon per year (MGY) plant receiving the equivalent of 110 truckloads of corn per day while shipping out 34 truckloads of ethanol and 36 truckloads of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). Unlike truck movements, shipment by rail requires that an ethanol plant either purchase or lease <b>rail</b> <b>tanker</b> cars to ship ethanol or hopper cars for DDGS. Thus, rail dependent ethanol plants incur an additional fixed cost. While ethanol profitability itself is relatively well studied, the effect of rail equipment costs on profitability is unknown. ^ This study examines the effect of rail equipment costs on dry-grind corn ethanol profitability. To estimate the rail equipment cost, linear programming (LP) models allocated flows of ethanol to blenders and DDGS to feeders. The LP model results were combined with plant size characteristics to estimate the number of rail cars required and the associated fixed costs of rail equipment. The number of rail cars depends on the distance to market and whether the shipment is by unit train or single car rail. Rail equipment costs were then added to an ethanol plant profitability model based on Eidman (2007). ^ Results first suggest that rail equipment leasing costs decrease profits by 7. 7 percent across all ethanol plants. However, rail dependent ethanol plants most likely factor in this additional cost {{as part of a}} bid price to distant markets to recoup the cost. Second, plants in the 51 to 100 MGY size range are more rail dependent than ethanol plants over 100 MGY. On average, 60 percent of plants have a rail requirement for shipping either ethanol or DDGS, while 40 percent of the ethanol plants are truck houses. Finally, results show that 42 percent of ethanol and 48 percent of DDGS move by rail from the six largest ethanol and DDGS producing states. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Petroleum products, {{which are}} {{required}} to keep the 'wheels' of industry and commerce turning, are distributed from the various refineries to their destinations throughout the country {{on a daily basis}} and the mode and extent of transportation or conveyance of these products is varied. This distribution activity predominantly takes place by means of road tanker, pipeline as well as <b>rail</b> <b>tanker</b> and quantities during transit could vary from a few hundred litres to many thousands of litres per trip. Road tanker transportation is considered to be the most vulnerable form of distribution means and this poses a high risk in terms of the potential for being involved in an accident. The risk potential associated with the road transportation of these fuels, from an environmental point of view, is aggravated due to: *The conveyance of bulk loads, *non-roadworthiness of many vehicles, *inconsistency in vehicle condition checking systems and in the application of *safety systems, *poor road conditions, *driver fatigue, *hi-jacking threats, *the level of incompetence or unsuitability of drivers, *the inconsistency in driver training programs, *the vulnerability of the tankers being subject to collision and accidents. The potential exists for road tankers involved in accidents to leak or spill large quantities of petroleum products which in turn could result in catastrophic environmental consequences (such as leaking large quantities of fuel into sewers, plantations, rivers and streams thus causing much ground and water pollution). Also, during an accident the fuel leaking from a road tanker may ignite causing it to burn for several hours before it is finally brought under control and extinguished. This may result in much air pollution as well as damage to the surrounding ecological systems. Subsequent explosions could further result in severe loss of life and associated fires which in turn could cause more environmental degradation and damage. For the purpose of this dissertation, focus was specifically placed on the introduction of internal company control measures that a "supplier” company (such as Natref (Pty) Ltd) could implement to check whether petroleum product distributors are complying with predetermined criteria aimed at reducing the potential for accidents involving road tankers. The measuring of how these controls have an effect in the bigger scheme of things in terms of reducing accidents and environmental degradation was very difficult to determine because {{it was not possible to}} extract from the distributors how many of their vehicles were actually involved in incidents during the study period. As a result it was not possible to determine whether the improved control measures had an effect on the number of accidents incurred by the vehicles that were effected by the improved application of the standards. The study thus focused primarily on the effect that the implementation of an inspection system could have in progressively reducing the number of defects found on road tankers wanting to gain access to Natrefs site as well as measuring whether an improvement in compliance to standards actually took place. This study was conducted over a period of 22 months and involved the development and implementation of a new procedure and training course, implementation of an inspection checklist, improved reporting methods as well as improved the overall environmental awareness of the employees involved in the checking and inspection process. It is however assumed that the implementation and ongoing enforcement of the company standards has assisted in contributing towards minimising the potential for pollution exposures arising from accidents and in so doing minimising environmental degradation to a larger or lesser extent.
