Routine care may be provided at a nursing home or assisted living facility, although the majority of hospice patients are treated at home. Interdisciplinary team members supply a variety of services during routine home care, including offering necessary supplies, such as durable medical equipment, medications related to the hospice diagnosis and incidentals like diapers, bed pads, gloves, and skin protectants. Twenty-four-hour on-call services must be available as needed. Typically this is provided after normal business hours by a <b>registered</b> <b>nurse</b> prepared to address urgent patient concerns.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this quantitative, {{descriptive}} study was to describe how <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> utilise teachable moments to enhance students' learning in the clinical setting. The research questions were: What are the problems faced by <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> when they teach students in the clinical setting? and How do <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> utilise teachable moments to teach students? A pilot {{study was conducted in}} the clinical setting involving the respondents who had similar characteristics than the population. The sample consisted of 45 <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> who provided direct patient care in the clinical setting. A self­ administered, structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Data analysis was done by using descriptive statistical tests.

Recommendations to improve clinical accompaniment by <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> through effective utilisation of teachable moments were made.

25|$|To work in {{the nursing}} profession, all nurses hold one or more {{credentials}} depending on their scope of practice and education. A licensed practical nurse (LPN) (also {{referred to as a}} licensed vocational nurse, registered practical nurse, enrolled nurse, and state enrolled nurse) works independently or with a <b>registered</b> <b>nurse</b> (RN). The most significant differentiation between an LPN and RN is found in the requirements for entry to practice, which determines entitlement for their scope of practice. For example, Canada requires a bachelor's degree for the RN and a two-year diploma for the LPN. A <b>registered</b> <b>nurse</b> provides scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of patients and families in many health care settings. Registered nurses may earn additional credentials or degrees.|$|E
40|$|Aim: This {{discussion}} paper poses the question ‘What enables or deters <b>Registered</b> <b>Nurses</b> {{to take up}} their professional responsibility to support undergraduate nursing students through the provision of clinical education?’. Background: Embedded within many nursing standards are expectations that <b>Registered</b> <b>Nurses</b> provide support and professional development to undergraduate nursing students undertaking clinical placements. Expectations within <b>nursing</b> standards that <b>Registered</b> <b>Nurses</b> provide support and professional development to nursing students are important because nursing students depend on <b>Registered</b> <b>Nurses</b> to help them to become competent practitioners. Results: Contributing factors that enable and deter <b>Registered</b> <b>Nurses</b> from fulfilling this expectation to support nursing students in their clinical learning include; workloads, preparedness for the teaching role, confidence in teaching and awareness of the competency requirement to support students. Conclusion: Factors exist which can enable or deter <b>Registered</b> <b>Nurses</b> from carrying out the licence requirement to provide clinical education and support to nursing students...|$|R

40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{describe}} how <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> having undergone a webbased learning activity perceive their self-efficacy and competence to support patients with smoking cessation {{in connection with}} surgery. Background: Smoking cessation in connection with surgery reduces postoperative complications, and the support patients get from <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> may be important in helping them become smoke-free in connection with their surgery. Therefore, <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> {{are in need of}} enhanced understanding about which kind of counselling is the most effective for smoking cessation. Educating large groups of <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> in a digital environment appears to be a flexible and cost-effective way. Design and methods: A convergent mixed-method design with data collection was done using questionnaires (n = 47) and semistructured interviews (n = 11). Inclusion criteria were <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> in surgical wards. The samples were nonprobability and modified nested. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used for data analysis. Results: After completing the web-based learning activity, the <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> perception was that of good self-efficacy and increased competence in supporting patients with smoking cessation in connection with surgery. They improved their understanding of how to talk about smoking cessation with patients in dialogue using open-ended questions. Nevertheless, the <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> requested opportunities for dialogue and interaction with colleagues or topic experts. Conclusions: The results indicate that <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> can enhance their competence in supporting patients to embrace smoking cessation by learning in a digital environment. Self-efficacy and understanding of the topic seems to motivate <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> to counsel patients about smoking cessation. Relevance to clinical practice: Findings from this study will be of particular interest to educators in healthcare settings who can devise further development of web-based learning activities...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore and {{describe}} <b>registered</b> <b>nurse's</b> perceptions with regard to continuing formal education. A quantitative descriptive, explorative research design was used to study <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> views with regard to continuing formal education and to identify the barriers to continuing formal education as experienced by <b>registered</b> <b>nurses.</b> Convenience sampling was used to select the research sample of <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> working at four state health institutions in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Descriptive statistics, based on calculations using the Microsoft (MS) Excel (for Windows 2000) programme, were used to summarise and describe the research results obtained from the questions completed by the <b>registered</b> <b>nurses.</b> The research results indicated that most <b>registered</b> <b>nurses</b> perceive continuing formal education as beneficial to their personal and professional growth and to improve the quality of patient/client care, but barriers exist which prevent or deter them from undertaking continuing formal education programmes. The main barriers were identified as structural barriers, including lack of funding, job and family responsibilities and lack of coherent staff development planning. Health StudiesM. A.
