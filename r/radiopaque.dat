25|$|The {{radiographic}} {{appearance of}} the local bone can become more <b>radiopaque</b> in chronic pericoronitis.|$|E
25|$|Imaging {{diagnostic}} {{techniques can}} identify a <b>radiopaque</b> mass {{that may be}} mistaken for foreign bodies, displaced teeth or calcified blood vessels. Computed tomography (CT) may reveal nonspecific calcified images in the tonsillar zone. The differential diagnosis must be established with acute and chronic tonsillitis, tonsillar hypertrophy, peritonsillar abscesses, foreign bodies, phlebolites, ectopic bone or cartilage, lymph nodes, granulomatous lesions or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament {{in the context of}} Eagle syndrome (elongated styloid process).|$|E
25|$|The {{large amount}} of mineral in enamel {{accounts}} {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Tooth enamel ranks 5 on Mohs hardness scale and has a Young's modulus of 83 GPa. Dentin, less mineralized and less brittle, 3–4 in hardness, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. On radiographs, the differences in the mineralization of different portions of the tooth and surrounding periodontium can be noted; enamel appears lighter than dentin or pulp since it is denser than both and more <b>radiopaque.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another underrecognized and {{potentially}} life-threatening side effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe constipation, fecal impaction, paralytic ileus, bowel obstruction, acute megacolon, ischemia or necrosis. Colonic hypomotility {{has been shown}} to occur in up to 80% of people prescribed clozapine when gastrointestinal function is measured objectively using <b>radiopaque</b> markers. Clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility currently has a higher mortality rate than the better known side effect of agranulocytosis. A Cochrane review found little evidence to help guide decisions about the best treatment for gastrointestinal hypomotility caused by clozapine and other antipsychotic medication. Monitoring bowel function and the preemptive use of laxatives for all clozapine-treated people {{has been shown to}} improve colonic transit times and reduce serious sequelae.|$|E
25|$|Projectional radiographs {{are useful}} in the {{detection}} of pathology of the skeletal system {{as well as for}} detecting some disease processes in soft tissue. Some notable examples are the very common chest X-ray, which can be used to identify lung diseases such as pneumonia, lung cancer, or pulmonary edema, and the abdominal x-ray, which can detect bowel (or intestinal) obstruction, free air (from visceral perforations) and free fluid (in ascites). X-rays may also be used to detect pathology such as gallstones (which are rarely <b>radiopaque)</b> or kidney stones which are often (but not always) visible. Traditional plain X-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the brain or muscle.|$|E
2500|$|As the X-rays {{pass through}} the patient, they are {{attenuated}} by varying amounts as they pass through or reflect off the different tissues of the body, casting an X-ray shadow of the <b>radiopaque</b> tissues (such as bone tissue) on the fluorescent screen. Images on the screen are produced as the unattenuated or mildly attenuated X-rays from radiolucent tissues interact with atoms in the screen through the photoelectric effect, giving their energy to the electrons. [...] While much of the energy given to the electrons is dissipated as heat, a fraction of it is given off as visible light.|$|E
2500|$|Soft tissues {{are seen}} with the same machine as for hard tissues, but a [...] "softer" [...] or less-penetrating X-ray beam is used. [...] Tissues {{commonly}} imaged include the lungs and heart shadow in a chest X-ray, the air pattern of the bowel in abdominal X-rays, the soft tissues of the neck, the orbits by a skull X-ray before an MRI to check for <b>radiopaque</b> foreign bodies (especially metal), {{and of course the}} soft tissue shadows in X-rays of bony injuries are looked at by the radiologist for signs of hidden trauma (for example, the famous [...] "fat pad" [...] sign on a fractured elbow).|$|E
50|$|The PDL {{appears as}} the {{periodontal}} space of 0.4 to 1.5 mm on radiographs, a radiolucent {{area between the}} <b>radiopaque</b> lamina dura of the alveolar bone proper and the <b>radiopaque</b> cementum.|$|E

50|$|A <b>radiopaque</b> cholegraphic (contrast) agent, usually {{iopanoic acid}} (Telepaque) or its sodium or calcium salt, is orally administered, which is {{absorbed by the}} intestine. This {{excreted}} material will collect in the gallbladder, where reabsorption of water concentrates the excreted contrast. Since only 10% of gallstones are <b>radiopaque,</b> the remaining 90% will appear as translucent on an opaque background in an abdominal X-ray.|$|E
50|$|In most countries, {{surgical}} sponges contain <b>radiopaque</b> {{material that}} can be readily identified in radiographic and CT images, facilitating detection. In the United States, <b>radiopaque</b> threads impregnated into surgical gauzes were first introduced in 1929 and were in general use by about 1940. Some surgeons recommend routine postoperative X-ray films after surgery to {{reduce the likelihood of}} foreign body inclusion.|$|E
50|$|It may {{be noted}} on radiographs as a <b>radiopaque</b> (or lighter) mass at each root apex.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is highly}} <b>radiopaque</b> and for example {{is used as}} a filler in <b>radiopaque</b> {{catheters}} which can be seen by x-ray. In modern medicine, bismuth subcarbonate has been made into nanotube arrays that exhibit antibacterial properties. It is also used in fireworks [...] to make Dragon's eggs. It is a constituent of milk of bismuth which was a popular digestive tract panacea in the 1930s ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{vascular}} snare is a {{endovascular device}} {{that is used}} to remove foreign bodies from inside arteries and veins. The snare consists of several <b>radiopaque</b> loops of wire inside a catheter, which when extended flower out, and which collapse when withdrawn into the catheter.|$|E
50|$|Galactography or ductography (or galactogram, ductogram) is {{a medical}} {{diagnostic}} procedure for viewing the milk ducts. The procedure involves the radiography of the ducts after injection of a <b>radiopaque</b> substance into the duct system. The procedure is used for investigating the pathology of nipple discharge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next stage}} {{involves}} {{the formation of}} a [...] which is successively layered with organic and inorganic material, eventually forming a calcified mass. In about 15-20% of cases the sialolith will not be sufficiently calcified to appear <b>radiopaque</b> on a radiograph, and therefore be difficult to detect.|$|E
50|$|Idiopathic osteosclerosis is a {{condition}} which may be found around the roots of a tooth. It is usually painless and found during routine radiographs. It appears as a <b>radiopaque</b> (light area) around a tooth, usually a premolar or molar. There {{is no sign of}} inflammation of the tooth.|$|E
50|$|In radiology, the {{thumbprint}} sign, or thumbprinting, is a radiologic sign {{found on}} a lateral C-spine radiograph that suggests the diagnosis of epiglottitis. The sign {{is caused by a}} thickened free edge of the epiglottis, which causes it to appear more <b>radiopaque</b> than normal, resembling the distal thumb.|$|E
5000|$|The {{radiographic}} {{features of}} periapical inflammatory lesions {{vary depending on}} the time course of the lesion. Because very early lesionsmay not show any radiographic changes, diagnosis of these lesions relies solely on the clinical symptoms [...] More chronic lesions may show lytic (radiolucent) or sclerotic (<b>radiopaque)</b> changes, or both.|$|E
50|$|Radiographs can {{be taken}} after {{injection}} of a <b>radiopaque</b> contrast medium into small lymphatic vessels (these are made visible by prior subcutaneous injection of patent blue dye). The resulting lymphogram is used to find the locations of large vessels and nodes, and to identify sites of blockage in lymphatic drainage.|$|E
50|$|He {{hypothesized}} that a catheter could be inserted {{directly into the}} heart, for such applications as directly delivering drugs, injecting <b>radiopaque</b> dyes, or measuring blood pressure. The fear {{at the time was}} that such an intrusion into the heart would be fatal. To prove his point, he decided to try the experiment on himself.|$|E
50|$|TTN is a {{diagnosis}} of exclusion {{as it is a}} benign condition that can have symptoms and signs similar to more serious conditions, such as respiratory distress syndrome. A chest X-ray may show a <b>radiopaque</b> line - fluid - in the horizontal fissure of the right lung, fluid infiltrate throughout alveoli or fluid in individual lung lobes.|$|E
50|$|The {{alveolar}} process {{contains a}} region of compact bone adjacent to the periodontal ligament (PDL), which is called the lamina dura when viewed on radiographs. It is this part which {{is attached to the}} cementum of the roots by the periodontal ligament. It is uniformly <b>radiopaque</b> (or lighter). Integrity of the lamina dura is important when studying radiographs for pathological lesions.|$|E
