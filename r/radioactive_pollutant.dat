40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for designing a ground-water-quality monitoring network is developed that links a ground-water pollution-transport simulation model and an optimization model. Tritium is considered as the (<b>radioactive)</b> <b>pollutant.</b> The model is formulated using chance constraints and solved {{by using a}} mixedinteger programming algorithm. It incorporates uncertainties in the prediction of pollutant movement in the saturated zone. Nonlinearities due to the inclusion of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of actual spatial concentrations are accommodated in the optimization model through a piecewise linearization scheme. The design of the optimal monitoring network {{is based on the}} solution of two {{mathematical model}}s: a simulation model for the prediction of <b>radioactive</b> <b>pollutant</b> transport in the saturated zone, and an optimization model. Constraints of the optimization model are formulated by incorporating results from the prediction-simulation model. The simulation model provides information about pollution transport with respect to time and space. The chance-constrained optimization model solution specifies the optimal location of the monitoring wells subject to the maximum limit on the number of such wells. Performance evaluation of the developed model demonstrates potential applicability of this model for designing ground-water-quality monitoring networks...|$|E
40|$|A widely {{applicable}} {{computational model}} of buoyant, bent- over plumes in realistic atmospheres is constructed. To do this, the two-dimensional, time-dependent fluid mechanics equations are numerically integrated, while {{a number of}} important physical ap- proximations serve to keep the approach at a tractable level. A three-dimensional picture of a steady state plume is constructed from a sequence of time-dependent, two-dimensional plume cross sections [...] each cross section of the sequence is spaced progres- sively further downwind as it is advected for a progressively longer time by the prevailing wind. The dynamics of the plume simulations are quite general. The buoyancy sources in the plume include the sensible heat in the plume, the latent heat absorbed or released in plume moisture processes, and the heating of the plume by a <b>radioactive</b> <b>pollutant</b> in the plume. The atmospheric state in the simulations is also quite general. Atmospheric var- iables are allowed to be functions of height, and the ambient atmospheric turbulence (also a function of height) is included in the simulations.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is developed}} {{based on the}} solution of optimization models for optimal design of groundwater quality monitoring networks. The optimal monitoring network is time varying as the monitoring wells are installed in stages, considering the transient pollutant transport process. The monitoring locations specified as solution to the optimization model change with time. This ensures additional economy in {{the installation of the}} network, compared to a single stage network design. The optimization model incorporates uncertainties in prediction or estimation of some of the aquifer parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity. Advective, dispersive, and radioactive decay processes of transport in a two-dimensional groundwater system are considered. Randomly generated aquifer parameter values are used to simulate different realizations of resulting pollutant plumes incorporating uncertainties in predicting the transport process. The simulated pollutant plume realizations are subsequently utilized to obtain cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of actual concentrations at different spatiotemporal locations. These CDFs are incorporated as an approximated distribution function in the optimization model. These CDFs are used to define chance constraints with associated reliabilities. Both single and multiple objective nonlinear optimization models are developed. Performances of these models are evaluated for different specified values of reliabilities using illustrative problems considering tritium (H 3) as the <b>radioactive</b> <b>pollutant.</b> This monitoring network design model is, in general, applicable to other types of pollutants as well...|$|E

40|$|While much of {{the work}} in the public {{understanding}} of science has focused on the public’s appreciation of science and their familiarity with key scientific concepts, understanding the processes involved in learning science has largely been ignored. This article documents a study of how particular members of the public learn about radiation and radioactivity, and proposes a model to describe their learning—the Informal Conceptual Change Model [ICCM]. ICCM is a multidimensional framework that incorporates three theoretical dimensions—the cognitive, conative, and affective. The paper documents each of these dimensions, and then illustrates the model by drawing upon data collected in a case study. The emphasis of the analysis is on understanding how the members of the public living in an area with high levels of background radiation learn about the science of this potential health threat. The summarizing comments examine the need for a greater awareness of the complexities of informal learning. In comparison with radiation doses from radon, the doses to individual members of the public and to the general community from nuclear activities are quite trivial.

Soils have long been considered as a closed and inert medium where wastes can be dumped without impact on living organisms.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons occur also in most ecosystems as a result of natural and anthropogenic processes. One of the key issue of understanding the fate of pollutants is the occurrence of bound residues. Bound residues are pollutants, or their degradation products, that are bound to organic and mineral matter such as humic substances. Here, the degree of binding will rule the availability of pollutant, and, in turn, will control their toxicity and release in water and atmosphere.

Nowadays, Russia and USA have 75 and 52 operating NPS, while UK has 16, France has 10, and China has 6. Naval reactors have been in most cases pressurised water types, which differ from commercial reactors producing electricity (PWR) in that: - they deliver {{a lot of power}} from a very small volume and therefore run on highly-enriched uranium (> 20 % U- 235, originally 93 % but apparently now 20 - 25 % in western vessels, and up to 45 % in later Russian ones). This nuclear material has also proliferation problems. - the fuel is not UO 2 but a U-Zr or U-Al alloy or a metal-ceramic. - they have long core lives, so that refuelling is needed only after 10 or more years, and new cores are designed to last 50 years in carriers and 30 - 40 years in submarines Decommissioning nuclear-powered submarines has become a major task for US and Russian navies. After defuelling, normal practice is to cut the reactor section from the vessel for disposal in shallow land burial as low-level waste. In Russia the whole vessels, or the sealed reactor sections, sometimes remain stored afloat indefinitely. Environmental consequences of such procedures may be very dangerous. Incidents and emergencies in atomic submarine fleet of USSR / RUSSIA have been many during their 50 years operational period of NPS: twelve nuclear and more 100 radiation emergencies have taken place. A nuclear emergency is such kind of emergency that concerns with the damage of fuel elements exceeding the established limits of safe operation, and/or irradiation of staff exceeding the permissible level for normal operation, caused by violation of control and managing of a chain nuclear reaction of fission in the reactor core, creation of a critical mass during reload, transportation and storage of fuel elements, or violation of heat elimination from fuel elements.

In this work, the procedure followed at the Nuclear Engineering Department of the National Technical University of Athens (NED-NTUA) for the calibration of an in-situ Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector, for the determination of gamma-emitting radionuclides deposited on the ground surface, is presented. BEGe detectors due to their technical characteristics are suitable for the analysis of photons in a wide energy region. Two different techniques were applied for the full-energy peak efficiency calibration of the BEGe detector in the energy region 60 - 1600 keV: a semi-empirical method based on the determination of the peak efficiency for a surface source geometry, from the experimentally obtained efficiency for a point source geometry a numerical method which is based on Monte Carlo simulation. For this purpose the PENELOPE computer code was employed. For the determination of the geometrical characteristics of the detector - a key parameter for the simulation accuracy - an iterative procedure involving a series of experiments and simulations was applied.

Considering that tritium derives from water activation while other pollutants are caused by activated cell materials released into water through erosion/corrosion mechanisms, such a spread is likely to be attributable to differences in the proton beam shape and position (production of different natural circulation patterns inside the target and different erosion mechanisms of the target cell walls). Both tritium and the other <b>radioactive</b> <b>pollutants</b> exhibit absolute values of activity and activity concentrations below the exemption limits set down in EURATOM Council Directive 96 / 29. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
