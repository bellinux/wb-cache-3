5000|$|A {{much more}} {{primitive}} {{as well as}} a much longer high-level encoding scheme was also used - BNPF (Begin-Negative-Positive-Finish). In BNPF encoding, a single byte (8 bits) would be represented by a highly <b>redundant</b> <b>character</b> framing sequence starting with a single ASCII [...] "B", eight ASCII characters where a [...] "0" [...] would be represented by a [...] "N" [...] and a [...] "1" [...] would be represented by a [...] "P", followed by an ending ASCII [...] "F". These ten-character ASCII sequences were separated by one or more whitespace characters, therefore using at least eleven ASCII characters for each byte stored (9% efficiency). The ASCII [...] "N" [...] and [...] "P" [...] characters differ in four bit positions, providing excellent protection from single punch errors. Alternative schemes were also available where [...] "H" [...] and [...] "L" [...] or [...] "0" [...] and [...] "1" [...] were also available to represent data bits, but in both of these encoding schemes, the two data-bearing ASCII characters differ in only one bit position, providing very poor single punch error detection.|$|E

40|$|Aristaless-related {{proteins}} are structurally {{defined by}} the presence of a paired-type homeodomain and an additional conserved domain, known as aristaless domain or OAR-domain. These proteins can be further categorized in three groups (Int. J. Dev. Biol., 43 (1999) 651). Group-I aristaless-related genes are linked to functions {{in the development of the}} craniofacial and appendicular skeleton and are expressed predominantly in the mesenchyme in stages from gastrulation through at least mid-gestation (Mech.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{proposes a}} new method for motion {{planning}} global optimization of a macro-micro manipulator (3 M) {{system based on}} Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA). Due to the <b>redundant</b> <b>character</b> of a 3 M system, its motion planning is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem under the mechanical constraints. After a task space division, optimization parameters are transferred from joint angles to division points of macro and micro part of the system, which largely reduces the searching space. However, to avoid sucking local extremum, global optimization is too time-consuming to bear. Instead of searching the division point space directly, EDA is applied to estimate the probability model of the division space and thus extracts mapping information between the optimization function and division points. Simulation results on a planar 4 degree-of-freedom (DOF) macro-micro manipulator system are presented herein to show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed methods.

The base consists of facts, ordinary rules and meta-rules, which differ from each other regarding both the syntax structure and the semantics.

50|$|In 1825, he {{published}} a book in German titled Lehrgebäude der slowenischen Sprache im Königreiche Illyrien und in den benachbarten Provinzen (Slovenian Textbook for the Kingdom of Illyria and Neighboring Provinces). Following {{the advice of the}} linguist Jernej Kopitar, his newly created alphabet (which soon became known as the metelčica 'Metelko alphabet') was phonetic, with each character corresponding a sound in the spoken language. It was also quite complicated, containing unneeded or <b>redundant</b> <b>characters</b> for glottal h and the clusters lj, nj, and šč as well as unfamiliar characters taken from Cyrillic. In addition, Metelko based his phonology on his local Lower Carniolan dialect, which was not acceptable for most contemporary Slovenian authors.|$|R

This redundancy improves the reliability of identification, provides a consistency check against user errors, and allows the user to proceed even if some of the characters could not be observed. In this case, the characters should be ordered according to their reliability and convenience. Further error tolerance can be achieved by using reticulation.|$|R

5000|$|The Moldovan Cyrillic {{alphabet}} {{was introduced}} in the early 1920s, in the Soviet bid to standardise the orthography of Moldovan/Romanian in the Moldavian ASSR, at the same time furthering political objectives by marking a clear distinction from the [...] "bourgeois" [...] Latin-based Romanian orthography introduced in Romania in the 1860s. As was the case with other Cyrillic-based languages in the Soviet Union, such as Russian, Ukrainian or Belarusian, obsolete and <b>redundant</b> <b>characters</b> were dropped in an effort to simplify orthography and boost literacy, making it also different from the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet used from the Middle Ages until {{the second half of the}} 19th century in the Principalities of Vallachia and Moldavia. Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet is an indirect revival of its Romanian counterpart. It was abandoned for a Latin-based alphabet during the Union-wide Latinisation campaign in 1932. [...] Its re-introduction was decided by the Central Executive Committee of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on May 19, 1938, albeit with an orthography more similar to standard Russian. Following the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, it was established as the official alphabet of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic until 1989, when a law returned to the standard Latin-based Romanian alphabet.|$|R

40|$|To {{what extent}} are young {{children}} sensitive to individual stroke, the smallest unit of writing in Chinese that carries no phonological or semantic information? The present study examined Chinese kindergartners&# 39; sensitivity to stroke and {{the contribution of}} reading ability and age to stroke sensitivity. Fifty five children from Beijing, including 28 4 -year-olds (M-age = 4. 55 years, SD = 0. 28, 16 males) and 29 5 -year-olds (M-age = 5. 58 years, SD = 0. 30, 14 males), were administered an orthographic matching task and assessed on non-verbal IQ and Chinese word reading. In the orthographic matching task, children were asked to decide whether two items were exactly the same or different in three conditions, with stimuli being correctly written characters (e. g., "(sic) "), stroke-missing or <b>redundant</b> <b>characters</b> (e. g., "(sic) "), and Tibetan alphabets (e. g., "(sic) "), respectively. The stimuli were presented with E-prime 2. 0 software and were displayed on a Surface Pro. Children responded by touching the screen and reaction time {{was used as a}} measure of processing efficiency. The 5 -year-olds but not the 4 -year-olds processed correctly written characters more efficiently than stroke-missing/redundant characters, suggesting emergence of stroke sensitivity from age 5. The 4 - and 5 -year-olds both processed correctly written characters more efficiently than Tibetan alphabets, ruling out the possibility that the 5 year olds&# 39; sensitivity to stroke was due to the unusual look of the stimuli. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that Chinese word reading explained 10 % additional variance in stroke sensitivity after having statistically controlled for age. Age did not account for additional variance in stroke sensitivity after having considered Chinese word reading. Taken together, findings of this study revealed that despite the visually highly complex nature of Chinese and the fact that individual stroke carries no phonological or semantic information, children develop sensitivity to stroke from age 5 and such sensitivity is significantly associated with reading experience. </p...|$|R

25|$|Another {{important}} Plautine stock character, {{discussed by}} K.C. Ryder, is the senex amator. A senex amator {{is classified as}} {{an old man who}} contracts a passion for a young girl and who, in varying degrees, attempts to satisfy this passion. In Plautus these men are Demaenetus (Asinaria), Philoxenus and Nicobulus (Bacchides), Demipho (Cistellaria), Lysidamus (Casina), Demipho (Mercator), and Antipho (Stichus). Periplectomenos (Miles Gloriosus) and Daemones (Rudens) are regarded as senes lepidi because they usually keep their feelings within a respectable limit. All of these characters have the same goal, to be with a younger woman, but all go about it in different ways, as Plautus could not be too <b>redundant</b> with his <b>characters</b> despite their already obvious similarities. What they have in common is the ridicule with which their attempts are viewed, the imagery that suggests that they are motivated largely by animal passion, the childish behavior, and the reversion to the love-language of their youth.|$|R
40|$|Experiments with {{microbes}} are {{a powerful}} tool for addressing general questions in evolutionary ecology. Microbial evolution is also interesting in its own right, and often clinically relevant. I have used experimental evolution of bacteria (Pseudomonas spp.) in controlled laboratory environments to investigate the role of environmental heterogeneity in the evolution of phenotypic diversity. Some of my results provide insight on general processes, while others are specific to bacteria. (1) I have shown that variation in resource supply affects the evolution of niche breadth in complex environments containing a range of available resources, leading to a peak in phenotypic diversity at intermediate levels. (2) I have found that resource availability also affects selection against <b>redundant</b> phenotypic <b>characters,</b> which is strongest when resources are scarce. (3) Using experiments with bacteria and their protozoan predators, I have found that selection for predator resistance varies with resource supply during a model adaptive radiation. (4) I have looked at the role of periodic bottlenecks in population size in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. My results highlight the importance of biochemical constraints specific to different resistance mutations. (5) Finally, I have shown that bacterial adaptation to novel carbon substrates affects different growth parameters simultaneously, and that the same response is seen in environments that maintain different levels of phenotypic diversity. These findings emphasize the role of environmental heterogeneity in the evolution of phenotypic diversity, but also show how ecological and genetic factors can constrain adaptation to a given niche within a heterogeneous environment.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{information}} theoretic approach for identifying functional subgraphs in complex networks where {{the dynamics of}} each node are observable. We show that the uncertainty {{in the state of}} each node can be expressed as a sum of information quantities involving a growing number of correlated variables at other nodes. We demonstrate that each term in this sum is generated by successively conditioning mutual informations on new measured variables, in a way analogous to a discrete differential calculus. The analogy to a Taylor series suggests efficient search algorithms for determining the state of a target variable in terms of functional groups of other degrees of freedom. We apply this methodology to electrophysiological recordings of networks of cortical neurons grown it in vitro. Despite strong stochasticity, we show that each cell's patterns of firing are generally explained by the activity of a small number of other neurons. We identify these neuronal subgraphs in terms of their mutually <b>redundant</b> or synergetic <b>character</b> and reconstruct neuronal circuits that account for the state of each target cell.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{describes}} the work performed in the Pattern Redundancy Analysis for Document Image Indexing and Transcription research project. The project focused on layout analysis, text/graphics separation, optical character recognition (OCR), and text transcription processes dedicated to old and precious books. The originality of this work relies on the analysis and exploitation of pattern redundancy in documents to enable the efficient indexing and quick transcription of books and the identification of typographic materials. For these purposes, we have developed two software packages. The first, AGORA, performs page layout analysis, text/graphics separation, and pattern (letterform) extraction simultaneously. These patterns are then processed to group similar patterns together in single clusters so that different letterforms of a book can be extracted and analysed to compute redundancy rates. This process allows a significant reduction {{of the number of}} letterforms to be recognized. Once the clustering of letterforms is done, a user may assign a label to each cluster using the second software, RETRO. Labels are then automatically assigned to each corresponding character to perform the text transcription of the whole book. Thus, if 90 % of the letterforms are detected as <b>redundant,</b> only one <b>character</b> out of ten must be labelled by the user to transcribe the book. Moreover, this transcription method allows us to deal easily with the special characters that appear frequently in old books. It is also possible to use our clustering approach to extract and create new font packages from specific printing material (e. g. from rare books printed with particular types or woodblocks). These new font packages could be incorporated into the training step of optical fonts recognition methods to improve the recognition results of OCRs on rare or specific books. The identification of typographic materials could also be useful for the study of both the aesthetic (such as how the thickness and shape of printing types evolved from the 15 th to the mid- 16 th century) and economic aspects of printing historically. Until {{the second half of the}} 16 th century, for instance, printing types circulated among workshops, and printers frequently sold or lent types to their fellows...|$|R
