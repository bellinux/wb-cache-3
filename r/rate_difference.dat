40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{volatility}} transmissions between portfolios of cross-listed equities and exchange <b>rate</b> <b>differences</b> and also the volatility persistence for home, foreign equities, and exchange <b>rate</b> <b>differences</b> in the UK and German markets. Design/methodology/approach – A primary focus of this paper is to see if there is an impact first on the volatility persistence for foreign equities that are listed in the UK and German markets, second on the respective home portfolios of cross-listed equities, and third on the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>differences.</b> In addition, whether there are any bilateral spillovers between the following equity portfolios: foreign cross-listed equities, home cross-listed equities, and also local or global exchange <b>rate</b> <b>differences</b> are investigated. Findings – The paper finds that the volatility persistence is more prominent than error persistence from cross-listed equities, foreign or home, and the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>differences.</b> Furthermore, the transmission mechanism indicates a bilateral integration process in some of the cases that were examined. Based on these results, it is concluded that in the UK market the foreign cross-listings affect less the domestic equities compared to the German market. Originality/value – This paper examines the interdependence of portfolios of home and foreign equities for cross-listings that belong to the same stock exchange with two exchange rates, a local and a global one in order to provide more evidence in this area of literature.

50|$|Isotopic {{substitution}} can {{modify the}} rate of reaction {{in a variety of}} ways. In many cases, the <b>rate</b> <b>difference</b> can be rationalized by noting that the mass of an atom affects the vibrational frequency of the chemical bond that it forms, even if the potential energy surface for the reaction is nearly identical. Heavier isotopes will (classically) lead to lower vibration frequencies, or, viewed quantum mechanically, will have lower zero-point energy. With a lower zero-point energy, more energy must be supplied to break the bond, resulting in a higher activation energy for bond cleavage, which in turn lowers the measured rate (see, for example, the Arrhenius equation).|$|E
50|$|Hydroboration is {{typically}} anti-Markovnikov, i.e. the hydrogen {{adds to the}} most substituted carbon of the double bond. That the regiochemistry is reverse of a typical HX addition reflects the polarity of the Bδ+-Hδ− bonds. Hydroboration proceeds via a four-membered transition state: the hydrogen and the boron atoms added on the same face of the double bond. Granted that the mechanism is concerted, {{the formation of the}} C-B bond proceeds slightly faster than the formation of the C-H bond. As a result, in the transition state, boron develops a partially negative charge while the more substituted carbon bears a partially positive charge. This partial positive charge is better supported by the more substituted carbon. If BH3 is used as the hydroborating reagent, reactions typically proceed beyond the monoalkyl borane compounds, especially for less sterically hindered small olefins. Trisubstituted olefins can rapidly produce dialkyl boranes, but further alkylation of the organoboranes is slowed because of steric hindrance.

50|$|In most countries, the {{majority}} of committed suicides are made by men but, in China, women are 40% more likely to commit suicide. Traditional gender roles in China hold women responsible for keeping the family happy and intact. Suicide for women in China is shown in literature to be an acceptable way to avoid disgrace that may be brought to themselves or their families. China and other non-Western countries have been affected less {{by the loss of}} manufacturing jobs, changing patterns of social relationships, and modification of family structure. This is one explanation of why suicide rates in China tend to be closer to the much lower suicide <b>rate</b> <b>difference</b> between men and women found in previous decades, in Western countries. Another explanation for increased suicide in women in China is that pesticides are easily accessible and tend to be used in many suicide attempts made by women. Another explanation is that women are seen as subservient to men due to Chinese gender roles. Thirdly, difficult living conditions and strict views on marriage and family values cause women high stress which is a risk factor for suicidal behavior. The rate of nonlethal suicidal behavior is 40 to 60 percent higher in women than it is in men. This {{is due to the fact}} that more women are diagnosed as depressed than men, and also that depression is correlated with suicide attempts.|$|E
5000|$|The Pew Research Center {{notes that}} [...] "the data {{that we have}} isnt {{pointing}} {{in the direction of}} Eurabia at all", and predicts that the percentage of Muslims is estimated to rise to 8% in 2030, due to immigration and above average birth rates. And only two western European countries - France and Belgium - will become around 10 percent Muslim, by 2030. According to Justin Vaïsse the fertility rate of Muslim immigrants declines with integration. He further points out that Muslims are not a monolithic or cohesive group, Most academics who have analysed the demographics dismiss the predictions that the EU will have Muslim majorities.It is completely reasonable to assume that the overall Muslim population in Europe will increase, and Muslim citizens have and will have a significant imprint on European life. The prospect of a homogenous Muslim community per se, or a Muslim majority in Europe is however out of the question. [...] Eric Kaufman of University of London denied the claims of Eurabia. According to him, Muslims will be a significant minority rather than majority in Europe and as per their projections for 2050 in the Western Europe, there will be 10-15 per cent Muslim population in high immigration countries such as Germany, France and the UK. Eric Kaufman also argue that the main reason why Islam is expanding along with other religions, is not because of conversion to Islam, but primarily {{to the nature of the}} religion as he call it “pro-natal”, where Muslims tend to have more children. However, Doug Saunders states that by 2030 Muslims and Non-Muslims birth rates will be equal in Germany, Greece, Spain and Denmark without taking account of the Muslims immigration to these countries. He also states that Muslims & Non-Muslims fertility <b>rate</b> <b>difference</b> will decrease from 0.7 to 0.4 and this different will continue to shrink as a result of which Muslims and non-Muslims fertility rate will be identical by 2050.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective. The {{management}} of mural thrombus complicating acute anterior myocardial infarction remains controversial {{in part because}} of the small size of studies on this topic. We performed a meta-analysis of published studies to address three questions: 1) What is the embolic risk of mural thrombi after myocardial Infarction? 2) What is the impact of systemic anticoagulation in reducing the embolic risk of mural thrombi? 3) What is the impact of systemic anticoagulation, thrombolytic therapy and antiplatelet therapy in preventing mural thrombus formation?Methods. Studies were identified by a computerized and manual search and were included if they were published in manuscript form in the English-language literature. Pooling of data was performed by calculating the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio and an event <b>rate</b> <b>difference</b> by the method of DerSimonian and Laird. Results. The odds ratio for increased risk of emboli in the presence of echocardiographically demonstrated mural thrombus (11 studies, 856 patients) was 5. 45 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 3. 02 to 9. 83), and the event <b>rate</b> <b>difference</b> was 0. 09 (95 % CI 0. 03 to 0. 14). The odds ratio of anticoagulation versus no anticoagulation in preventing embolization (seven studies, 270 patients) was 0. 14 (95 % CI 0. 04 to 0. 52) with an event <b>rate</b> <b>difference</b> of − 0. 33 (95 % CI − 0. 50 to − 0. 16). The odds ratio of anticoagulation versus control in preventing mural thrombus formation (four studies, 307 patients) was 0. 32 (95 % CI 0. 20 to 0. 52), and the event <b>rate</b> <b>difference</b> was − 0. 19 (95 % CI − 0. 09 to − 0. 28). The odds ratio for thrombolytic therapy in preventing mural thrombus (six studies, 390 patients) was 0. 48 (95 % CI 0. 29 to 0. 79) with an event <b>rate</b> <b>difference</b> of − 0. 16 (95 % CI 0. 10 to − 0. 42), whereas for antiplatelet agents (two studies, 112 patients) the odds ratio was 1. 43 (95 % CI 0. 04 to 56. 8) with an event <b>rate</b> <b>difference</b> of 0. 16 (95 % CI − 0. 20 to 0. 52). Conclusions. This analysis supports the hypotheses that 1) mural thrombus after myocardial infarction poses a significantly increased risk of embolization, 2) the risk of embolization is reduced by systemic anticoagulation, and 3) anticoagulation can prevent mural thrombus formation.
