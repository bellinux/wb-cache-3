6000|$|... 'And {{where will}} you live meanwhile, Sir?' said Mr. Pickwick, as he laid {{the amount of the}} first week's <b>rent,</b> in <b>advance,</b> on the tottering table.|$|R
60|$|Such an {{authority}} was indisputable. Mrs. Tuggs paid a week’s <b>rent</b> in <b>advance,</b> {{and took the}} lodgings for a month. In an hour’s time, the family were seated at tea in their new abode.|$|R
60|$|When {{the landlady}} appeared, {{the captain was}} as good as his word. He at once agreed to her terms, as well as her stipulations, and paid the first week's <b>rent</b> in <b>advance</b> on the spot.|$|R
50|$|On March 12, 1996 the Chicago Rockers {{announced}} {{they were moving}} to La Crosse, Wisconsin after the 1995-96 season. The team reached an agreement {{to play at the}} La Crosse Center, paying one-years <b>rent</b> in <b>advance.</b> They would later become known as the La Crosse Bobcats.|$|R
50|$|Roan Mountain State Park has a 107-site {{campground}} for tents, trailers, and RVs, {{as well as}} 30 rental cabins {{available by}} reservation. A modern meeting facility is also available for <b>rent,</b> by <b>advance</b> reservation. Picnicking is also available in the park. There are three picnic pavilions.|$|R
60|$|Kadir Baksh did not {{say that}} he had taken from each gang two annas for <b>rent</b> in <b>advance,</b> and then, beyond my earshot, had beaten them with the big green {{umbrella}} whose use I could never before divine. But Kadir Baksh has no notions of morality.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us go {{back and}} 'ecraser l'infame' by paying him a year's <b>rent</b> in <b>advance</b> and taking {{immediate}} possession. Nothing else can soothe my wounded feelings. You were not having your boots blacked: why shouldn't he have supposed you were a New-Yorker, and I a country cousin?" ...|$|R
50|$|Salamanca Market {{had grown}} quite {{considerably}} by 1977, with many stallholders attending regularly and so an informal Stallholders' Association, chaired by Philip Broughton, was established. He negotiated {{the concept of}} 'Permanent Stallholders' with the Council. This resulted in regular stallholders being identified, assigned fixed sites and paying <b>rent</b> in <b>advance.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Our new quarters!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} cheerfully. [...] "The {{room at the}} other end of the passage is mine. A pound a week and a woman to come in and light the fires! Mr. Jarvis let me have some money and I paid three months' <b>rent</b> in <b>advance.</b> What do you think of them?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Joyce {{entered a}} {{franchise}} partnership with Horton in 1967, and Joyce reportedly wrote [...] "You must be kidding!" [...] {{in reference to}} the clause of the one-page franchise agreement requiring <b>rent</b> in <b>advance.</b> After Horton's death in an auto accident in 1974, [...] Joyce purchased Horton's share for about $1 million and assumed control of the full Tim Horton franchise.|$|R
50|$|Lakewood Church {{relocated}} to the Compaq Center on July 16, 2005. It is a 16,800-seat facility in southwest downtown Houston along U.S. Highway 59, that has twice {{the capacity of}} its former sanctuary. The church was required to pay $11.8 million in <b>rent</b> in <b>advance</b> for the first 30 years of the lease. Lakewood renovated the new campus at an estimated cost of $100 million.|$|R
50|$|The {{businessmen}} {{sold the}} Westinghouse Electric Corporation, located in Sharon, {{the idea of}} leasing three of the warehouses. They also entered into an agreement whereby lessor would pay the first year's <b>rent</b> in <b>advance</b> and, as a result, the association could be certain of eventually having an additional $30,643 added to the $2,500 in GBMA funds on a three-year lease-purchase agreement. Without Westinghouse, the association {{never would have been}} able to do what was done.|$|R
50|$|In August 2012 Cognita {{questioned}} the financial viability of its Ffynone House School in Swansea. Following lobbying and negotiation {{by parents and}} staff of the school, Cognita agreed to surrender the school to its lessor, Ffynone House School charitable trust, from which Cognita had leased the school. Cognita paid the trust £535,000 as a surrender sum and 10 years <b>rent</b> in <b>advance</b> of £270,000 and the school continues to operate with an operating surplus.|$|R
5000|$|Premiums and {{payments}} of <b>rent</b> in <b>advance</b> {{were forbidden to}} be charged to tenants of premises that had become decontrolled by the Act {{for a period of}} three years from the commencement of the Act. A minimum of four weeks’ notice to quit was introduced and the Act enabled the exchange of controlled tenancies by agreement of all parties concerned, without loss of security or rent control, The Act used the word [...] "exchange" [...] although [...] "transfer" [...] would have been more apt.|$|R
50|$|Erich Ancher sent a {{long letter}} to the {{authorities}} in January 1752, regarding the various problems with manufacturing cannons and with possible solutions. The cannons should be more solid, less arbitrary testing and a standing, <b>rent</b> free <b>advance</b> of 50,000 riksdaler. If the authorities in Copenhagen so wished the casting of cannons could be terminated, it was done {{for the sake of}} the country. On 30 August 1752 a royal decree was issued, granting Moss Jernverk an expanded advance, mortgaged in the premises and dependent on a successful test shooting, now in Copenhagen.|$|R
5000|$|The first month's <b>rent</b> in <b>advance</b> plus a {{refundable}} bond (usually {{equal to}} one month's rent) is also generally required. Most residential lettings in the UK {{are governed by}} [...] "Assured Shorthold Tenancy" [...] contracts. Assured shorthold tenancies (generally referred to simply as [...] "Shorthold") give less statutory protection than earlier, mostly obsolete, types of residential lettings. Shorthold tenancy agreements are standard contracts; the wording is generally available from legal stationers {{and on the internet}} for around £1.00, although most lettings agents will charge £30 to provide one.|$|R
60|$|Miss Carruthers, of the refined comedy team--did {{you ever}} see her cross both feet back of her neck?--gave me {{to a friend of}} hers who had made an unfortunate {{marriage}} with a man in a store. Consequently I was placed in the window of a furnished room, <b>rent</b> in <b>advance,</b> water two flights up, gas extra after ten o'clock at night. Two of my leaves withered off here. Also, I was moved from one room to another so many times that I got to liking the odor of the pipes the expressmen smoked.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new model of {{intellectual}} property that presents a different view than the market failure/monopoly <b>rent</b> model <b>advanced</b> by Arrow (1962), in which governments protect inventors from private theft. Instead, using Olson (1993), we represent a public theft model of intellectual property arising when entrepreneurs acting in global markets seek protection from a stationary bandit (their home government) principally against the depredations of other governments (the roving bandits). This model explains why institutional quality matters to the global location of R&D intensive industries, such as biopharma, and why so much intellectual property is located in tax havens...|$|R
60|$|Having paid a week's <b>rent</b> in <b>advance</b> he took possession, {{furnished}} {{the apartment}} with one old chair, one older table, one bundle of straw in a sack, one extremely old blanket, and one brand-new pipe with a corresponding ounce {{or two of}} tobacco. Then he locked the trap-door, put the key in his pocket, and descended to the street, where at Bird-fair he provided himself with sundry little cages and a few birds. Having conveyed these with some food for himself and the little birds to his lodging he again descended to the street, and treated himself to a pint of beer.|$|R
60|$|Not {{a moment}} {{was lost in}} {{following}} up the clue. The house in question had been unoccupied for some time. The owner was, however, known to Van Duyk, who at once called upon him. He {{said that he had}} let it some weeks before, to a person who had stated that he was a merchant of Amsterdam, and intended to open a branch house at Dort. He had paid him six months' <b>rent</b> in <b>advance,</b> and had received the keys of the house. He believed that some of his party had arrived, as he had himself seen two men go in, but the house was certainly not yet open for business.|$|R
6000|$|... "After supper the Prince and {{his guests}} retired to an inner room for consultation, while the Adherent {{stood in the}} background. After some {{discussion}} {{it was decided that}} early in the morning the Prince should go to the palace, and should agree to lease the principality for five years, provided the Dowager would accept one half the sum she had originally asked; and that he should also absolutely refuse to board the Dowager, or to allow her to reserve any part of the palace for her own use. He would promise to pay one quarter's <b>rent</b> in <b>advance</b> if these terms were agreed upon on the spot.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s, Duncan Carse, {{for whom}} Mount Carse was named, {{surveyed}} various inland areas of South Georgia. He negotiated a rent of a shilling per annum for four hectares of land at Ducloz Head, and paid ten years <b>rent</b> in <b>advance.</b> On 23 February 1961, Carse was dropped off by HMS Owen with 12 tonnes of supplies, and a prefabricated hut. He was revisited in April, {{but it was}} on 20 May that a freak wave washed him, his hut and his supplies into the sea. He managed to survive the Southern Winter for another 116 days, when he was rescued by a sealing ship.|$|R
6000|$|... "With some {{difficulty}} I {{have succeeded in}} getting an endurable sitting-room and bedroom in this house, where the people are perfect strangers to me. Having paid a week's <b>rent</b> in <b>advance</b> (for I naturally preferred dispensing with a reference), I find myself with exactly three shillings and ninepence left in my purse. It is impossible to ask Midwinter for money, after he has already paid Mrs. Oldershaw's note of hand. I must borrow something to-morrow on my watch and chain at the pawnbroker's. Enough to keep me going for a fortnight is all, and more than all, that I want. In that time, or in less than that time, Midwinter will have married me." ...|$|R
60|$|The cab drew up {{in front}} of a stone {{apartment}} house; and Jill, getting out, passed under an awning through a sort of mediæval courtyard, gay with potted shrubs, to an inner door. She was impressed. Evidently the tales one heard of fortunes accumulated overnight in this magic city were true, and one of them must have fallen to the lot of Uncle Chris. For nobody to whom money was a concern could possibly afford to live in a place like this. If Croesus and the Count of Monte Cristo had applied for lodging there, the authorities would probably have looked on them a little doubtfully at first and hinted at the desirability of a month's <b>rent</b> in <b>advance.</b>|$|R
50|$|In November 1891, Deeming (still {{using the}} name Williams) took Mather to Australia in the German {{steamship}} Kaiser Wilhelm II. They arrived in Melbourne on 15 December 1891. Deeming rented a house in Andrew Street Windsor, a suburb of Melbourne. On 24 December or early on 25 December 1891, he murdered Mather and buried her under the hearthstone {{of one of the}} bedrooms, covering the body with cement. He had paid a month's <b>rent</b> in <b>advance,</b> giving the name Mr. Drewn, but almost immediately left the property. The owner, nearby butcher John Stamford, had been happy to rent to the man, because of his air of respectability, and at first had not even known the man's name.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the western}} side of the city, {{beginning}} in the 1930s, retail shops were grouped under the name Merchants Square to accommodate and mollify local merchants the Restoration displaced. <b>Advancing</b> <b>rents</b> and tourist-driven businesses eventually drove out all the old-line community enterprises but a dress shop. One of the last to be forced out, a popular-with-locals drugstore complete with lunch counter, was supplanted by an upscale, national kitchenware chain store.|$|R
6000|$|... "There you are, George. You are {{master of}} the house now. The agent said the {{reference}} was most satisfactory; so I paid him the seven and sixpence you gave me for a week's <b>rent</b> in <b>advance,</b> {{and you can go}} in when you like. We shall be sorry to lose you both, for I don't want two better lodgers. You don't give no trouble, and all has been quiet and pleasant in the house; and to think what a taking I was in that day as Bob brought you here for the first time, to think as he had let the room to two boys. But there, one never knows, and I wouldn't have believed it as boys could be so quiet in a house." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{handsome}} young man (Ivor Novello), bearing a strong resemblance to {{the description of the}} murderer, arrives at the house and asks about the room for rent. Mrs. Bunting (Marie Ault) shows him the room, which is decorated with portraits of beautiful young blond women. The man is rather secretive, which puzzles Mrs. Bunting. However he willingly pays her a month's <b>rent</b> in <b>advance,</b> and asks only for a little to eat. Mrs. Bunting is surprised to see that the lodger is turning all the portraits around to face the wall -- he politely requests that they be removed. Daisy comes in to remove the portraits, and an attraction begins to form between Daisy and the lodger. The women return downstairs, where they hear the lodger's heavy footsteps as he paces the floor.|$|R
5000|$|On February 16, 1934, Elliott eluded Peru, Indiana {{police who}} had {{stationed}} a road block on U.S. Route 31 upon reports from Kokomo police {{that she had}} been seen heading in that direction. On March 3, 1934, John Dillinger escaped from the Crown Point, Indiana jail. For eighteen days, Dillinger, Pearl Elliott and Joseph Burns hid out in a Chicago apartment. [...] Two weeks <b>advance</b> <b>rent</b> was paid for the apartment by a woman identified as Elliott.|$|R
60|$|Rachel, on {{the other}} hand, felt calmly magnanimous in the {{completion}} of a veritable sacrifice, for those books had afforded her much enjoyment, and she would much like to have possessed many of those that would be tossed aside at a cheap rate. But the constant small expenses entailed by the first setting on foot such an establishment as the F. U. E. E. were a heavy drain on her private purse, as she insisted on all accounts being brought to her, and then could not bear that these small nondescript matters should be charged upon the general fund, which having already paid the first half-year's <b>rent</b> in <b>advance,</b> and furnished the house, must be recruited by some extraordinary supply before she could build. The thing could not be done at all but by rigid economy, and she was ready to exercise it, and happy in so doing. And the Colonel? She thought the pain of her resolution was passing. After all, it was not so dreadful as people would have one believe, it was no such wrench as novels described to make up one's mind to prefer a systematically useful life to an agreeable man.|$|R
5000|$|Krysten Ritter as Chloe, the eponymous [...] "Bitch in Apartment 23". She is an amoral {{and irresponsible}} party girl, freeloading, scamming, free-spirit, and swindler {{described}} as having [...] "the morals of a pirate," [...] who becomes June's roommate. After first attempting to run her [...] "roommate scam" [...] on June by convincing her to pay several months' <b>rent</b> in <b>advance</b> before driving {{her out of the}} apartment, Chloe eventually comes to welcome her after June proves capable of turning Chloe's scams back on her. Chloe, who usually finds other women boring, discovers that she genuinely likes June and tries to be both protective and helpful in her own borderline sociopathic ways (such as slipping June illegal Chinese pharmaceuticals to help her [...] "loosen up" [...] and turning June's small homemade jam business into a lucrative internet erotica site). Chloe's only steady work is [...] "providing entertainment" [...] to diplomats at the United Nations once a year, during which she pays her share of rent for the year, while in the meantime running day-to-day scams to provide her with free food, free drinks, and spending money. Her scams have gotten her {{in trouble with the law}} more than once.|$|R
50|$|At first, Chas is {{contemptuous of}} Turner, and Turner {{attempts}} {{to return the}} <b>rent</b> paid in <b>advance,</b> but they start influencing each other. Chas also enjoys intimate moments with Pherber, during which he shows his bisexual tendencies. Pherber and Turner understand his conflict and want to understand what makes him function so well within his world. To speed up the process, Pherber tricks him by feeding him a mushroom (Amanita muscaria), and Chas then accuses her and Turner of poisoning him. After that evening, Chas opens up, and he begins a caring relationship with Lucy, implying that he outgrew the psychological boundaries he was stuck in, due to having {{to function as a}} stereotypically masculine man within a gangster world.|$|R
60|$|I. That the {{province}} of Oude and its dependencies were, before their connection with and subordination to the Company, in a flourishing condition with regard to culture, commerce, and population, and their rulers and principal nobility maintained themselves {{in a state of}} affluence and splendor; but very shortly after the period aforesaid, the prosperity both of the country and its chiefs began sensibly and rapidly to decline, insomuch that the revenue of the said province, which, on the lowest estimation, had been found, in the commencement of the British influence, at upwards of three millions sterling annually, (and that ample revenue raised without detriment to the country,) did not in the year 1779 exceed the sum of 1,500,000l., and in the subsequent years did fall much short of that sum, although the <b>rents</b> were generally <b>advanced,</b> and the country grievously oppressed in order to raise it.|$|R
30|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} dynamic spectrum leasing strategies (with and without anticipated resource leasing) for CCRNs with fixed-rate traffic that has stringent delay constraints (such as the traffic flow generated by the unsolicited grant service class defined in Mobile WiMAX [20]). For comparison purposes, the permanent leasing strategy is also investigated. In the permanent spectrum leasing strategy, a fixed number of resources is permanently rented. On the other hand, the intuition behind the dynamic spectrum leasing strategy is to attempt to rent a channel only when needed and release {{it as soon as}} it is not needed. Finally, the intuition behind the anticipated spectrum leasing strategy is to attempt <b>renting</b> resources in <b>advance</b> (and release <b>rented</b> resources only when a preset minimum number of resources is achieved) to increase the probability of having available resource to be used when needed. In the next section, we briefly review the previously related work and point out the contribution of the present work.|$|R
50|$|In a sub-plot, Kinsey {{has decided}} it's {{time to leave}} her current rented office space at Kingman and Ives, and finds her dream office space up for rental by {{brothers}} Richard and Tommy Hevener. After snapping {{it up with a}} big <b>advance</b> <b>rent</b> cheque, and tentatively starting to date the attractive Tommy, Kinsey receives a shocking visit from one Mariah Talbot, who explains that the Heveners are suspects in the murder of their parents in Texas some years before; given Kinsey's blossoming relationship with Tommy, she is hoping Kinsey will help her entrap the brothers. Kinsey is in a dilemma; ultimately Henry carries out the entrapment himself to protect Kinsey after failing to persuade her to steer clear of it. After a dangerous showdown with the Hevener brothers, in which Richard kills Tommy with Kinsey's gun, Kinsey finds out that she was duped by Mariah Talbot; she is really the sister of the Heveners' hired accomplice whom they are also suspected of murdering.|$|R
60|$|These matters being arranged, and Frank agreeing {{at once to}} the {{proposition}} that as he was a stranger it would make things more comfortable were he to pay his <b>rent</b> in <b>advance,</b> found himself alone in his new apartment. It was a room about ten feet square. The bed occupied one corner, with the washstand at its foot. There was a small {{table in front of}} the fireplace, and two chairs; a piece of carpet half covered the floor, and these with the addition of the articles in the cupboard constituted the furniture of the room. Feeling hungry after his journey Frank resolved to go out at once and get something to eat, and then to lay in a stock of provisions. After some hesitation regarding the character of the meal he decided upon two Bath buns, determining to make a substantial tea. He laid in a supply of tea, sugar, butter, and salt, bought a little kettle, a frying pan, and a gridiron. Then he hesitated as to whether he should venture upon a mutton chop or some bacon, deciding finally in favor of the latter, upon the reflection that any fellow could see whether bacon were properly frizzled up, while as to a chop there was no seeing anything about it till one cut it. He, therefore, invested in a pound of prime streaky Wiltshire bacon, the very best, as the shopman informed him, that could be bought. He returned carrying all his purchases, {{with the exception of the}} hardware. Then he inquired of his landlady where he could get coal.|$|R
