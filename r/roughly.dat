5|$|The Aitareya, Kauṣītaki and Taittirīya Upanishads may date to {{as early}} as the mid 1st {{millennium}} BCE, while the remnant date from between <b>roughly</b> the 4th to 1st centuries BCE, <b>roughly</b> contemporary with the earliest portions of the Sanskrit epics.|$|E
5|$|The largest nearby star is Sirius, {{a bright}} main-sequence star <b>roughly</b> 8.6 light-years away and <b>roughly</b> twice the Sun's mass {{and that is}} orbited by a white dwarf, Sirius B. The nearest brown dwarfs are the binary Luhman 16 system at 6.6 light-years. Other systems within ten light-years are the binary red-dwarf system Luyten 726-8 (8.7ly) and the solitary red dwarf Ross 154 (9.7ly). The closest solitary Sun-like star to the Solar System is Tau Ceti at 11.9 light-years. It has <b>roughly</b> 80% of the Sun's mass but only 60% of its luminosity. The closest known {{free-floating}} planetary-mass object to the Sun is WISE 0855−0714, an object with a mass less than 10 Jupiter masses <b>roughly</b> 7 light-years away.|$|E

5|$|According to an Iranian {{radio station}} report, 200 villages {{sustained}} severe damage or were totally destroyed. The United States Geological Survey estimated that 10,533houses were destroyed; an additional 5,474 homes sustained {{varying degrees of}} damage. Fifty thousand people were left homeless. Local officials initially estimated {{the cost of the}} damage at $67million 1997 US$ (<b>roughly</b> 89.5million 2008 USD). The estimate was later raised to 100million 1997 USD (<b>roughly</b> 133.6million 2008 USD). One hundred schools and many health centers in the stricken areas were discovered to be in need of repair work.|$|E

5|$|Another {{long night}} at general {{quarters}} was anticipated by CTF 38. This intelligence was proved correct in short order. TGs38.1, 38.2, and 38.3 all suffered mass enemy air attacks between <b>roughly</b> 15:00–18:30 hours.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{designation}} of SR78, a road known as the Brawley-Westmorland-Julian-Oceanside Highway (connecting Oceanside, Escondido, Ramona, Julian, Westmorland, and Brawley) existed during the early twentieth century. This road <b>roughly</b> followed the current routing of SR78 from Escondido {{to the east of}} Brawley, although it traveled along a different routing from Westmorland into Brawley. No road connected Brawley with Glamis in 1919; it was necessary to travel north through Calipatria to reach Blythe. East of the Sand Hills, there was a road from Glamis passing by Smith Well into Palo Verde, which <b>roughly</b> follows the routing of SR78.|$|E
5|$|Beta, Gamma, and Iota Serpentis form a {{distinctive}} triangular shape marking {{the head of}} the snake, with Kappa Serpentis being <b>roughly</b> midway between Gamma and Iota. The brightest of the four with an apparent magnitude of <b>roughly</b> 3.67, Beta Serpentis is a white main-sequence star <b>roughly</b> 160 parsecs distant. It is likely that a nearby 10th-magnitude star is physically associated with Beta, although it is not certain. The Mira variable R Serpentis, situated between Beta and Gamma, is {{visible to the naked eye}} at its maximum of 5th-magnitude, but, typical of Mira variables, it can fade to below magnitude 14. Gamma Serpentis itself is an F-type subgiant located only 11 parsecs distant and thus is quite bright, being of magnitude 3.84 ± 0.05. The star is known to show solar-like oscillations.|$|E
5|$|Between Lejontornet and the {{southern}} city gate flanked by two boats is a wooden structure, <b>roughly</b> triangular in plan; this is a defensive tower called Kivenäbben, built in 1520–1523 on piles in the water.|$|E

5|$|During the storm, <b>roughly</b> 50,500 people {{sought refuge}} in shelters set {{up across the}} country. Throughout the Philippines, 47 people {{were killed by the}} typhoon, mostly from drowning. Sixteen of these {{fatalities}} occurred in Isabela Province, where Elsie made landfall. Heavy rains triggered several landslides across mountainous areas of the country. High winds also created deadly air-borne debris, including roofing and tree limbs. Downed power lines across the northern provinces left most of Luzon without power. Officials stated that about 61,300 homes were either damaged or destroyed by Elsie in the Philippines. In the wake of the typhoon, <b>roughly</b> 332,000 people were left homeless. Damages sustained by agriculture amounted to 105million PHP ($2,253,702 USD). In all, Typhoon Elsie killed 47 people and injured 363 others in the Philippines, and left <b>roughly</b> $35.4million in damages.|$|E

5|$|From 1909 onwards, Kentrosaurus {{remains were}} {{uncovered}} in four quarries in the Mittlere Saurierschichten (Middle Saurian Beds) and one quarry in the Obere Saurierschichten (Upper Saurian Beds). During four field seasons, the German Expedition found over 1200 bones of Kentrosaurus, belonging to about fifty individuals, {{many of which}} were destroyed during the Second World War. Today, almost all remaining material is housed in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (<b>roughly</b> 350 remaining specimens), while the museum of the Institute for Geosciences of the Eberhard-Karls-University Tübingen houses a composite mount, <b>roughly</b> 50% of it being original bones.|$|E
5|$|From {{at least}} the time of Antigonus III Doson, the most elite Antigonid-period {{infantry}} were the peltasts, lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding peltai javelins, swords, and a smaller bronze shield than Macedonian phalanx pikemen, although they sometimes served in that capacity. Among the peltasts, <b>roughly</b> 2,000 men were selected {{to serve in the}} elite agema vanguard, with other peltasts numbering <b>roughly</b> 3,000. The number of peltasts varied over time, perhaps never more than 5,000 men. They fought alongside the phalanx pikemen, divided now into chalkaspides (bronze shield) and leukaspides (white shield) regiments.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, Type-0 HD {{reached the}} top of the sales charts in its debut week, selling 93,000: the PS4 version {{accounted}} for <b>roughly</b> 92,000, while the Xbox One version sold <b>roughly</b> 1,000. Type-0 HD, together with , provoked a rise in sales for the PS4 while other console sales remained consistent, but it ultimately performed poorly, selling through only 59.59% of its shipment. It had sold over 128,000 units in Japan by August 2015, being the 26th best-selling video game during that period.|$|E
