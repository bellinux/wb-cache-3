5|$|Recent {{volcanism}} in the Cascades, lasting from 7 to 2 mya, produced largely basaltic and basaltic andesite-based material (up to 50percent). On {{the eastern}} side of the High Cascades, however, volcanoes erupted dacite, andesite, and <b>rhyolite.</b> These materials made up several types of eruptions: lava flows, domes, and pyroclastic flows. In the most recent volcanic activity, andesite, basalt, and <b>rhyolite</b> have been erupted from High Cascades volcanoes, particularly the Three Sisters, Broken Top, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, and Crater Lake.|$|E
5|$|The felsic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of phonolite, trachyte, phonolitic trachyte, quartz-trachyte and <b>rhyolite</b> lava.

40|$|Factors {{controlling}} {{the origin of}} silicic magmas on Iceland are poorly constrained. Here we present new data on H 2 O content, pressure, temperature, oxygen fugacity, and oxygen isotope composition of <b>rhyolites</b> from Askja, Öræfajökull, and Hekla volcanoes. All these parameters correlate with tectonic (rift and off-rift) setting of the volcanoes. Askja rift <b>rhyolites</b> originate through extensive assimilation of high-temperature hydrothermally altered crust (δ 18 O[*]<[*] 2 ‰) at shallow depths (≥ 1. 8 [*]km).

5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million years ago was predominately felsic, producing large volumes of <b>rhyolite</b> and trachyte lava. This {{can be explained by}} the presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10–30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of pumice flows, bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in <b>rhyolite</b> breccias.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in this {{chain is}} calc-alkaline, {{yielding}} both andesite, dacite, and <b>rhyolite.</b> Three million years ago, {{a change in}} the chemistry of volcanism occurred, with an increased content of potassium in the rocks. This change in composition geographically coincided with the volcanic activity crossing a lineament known as the Trotus line.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. Alkalic <b>rhyolites</b> with {{peralkaline}} affinities, bearing quartz and potassic feldspar pheno-crysts, {{are described}} from Iceland {{for the first}} time. Evidence from electron-probe analyses of feldspar phenocrysts indicates crystallization {{in or near the}} thermal valley of the system SiO 2 -Or-Ab. Icelandic acid volcanic rocks are subdivided into alkalic <b>rhyolites,</b> belonging to transitional nd alkalic basalt lineages, and the mildly calc-alkaline <b>rhyolites</b> of tholeiite lineages. PUBLISHED chemical and mineralogical data on some acid rocks from eastern Iceland have provided good documentation f a suite of acid volcanic rocks typified by a high silica/alkalis ratio (greater than 9), an affinity with calc-alkaline acid rocks, and the presence of plagioclase phenocrysts as the salic, and often the only pheno-cryst phase (Carmichael, 1962, 1963). Their association with tholeiitic basalt lavas has been pointed out by Carmichael (I 963) who suggested that these one-feldspar <b>rhyolites</b> were typical products of the fractionation of a tholeiitic magma.

40|$|Many {{continental}} flood basalt provinces contain <b>rhyolites</b> with ‘A-type’ compositions {{and many}} studies have concluded that these higher silica rocks are crustal melts from metapelitic or tonalitic country rock. However, {{although many of the}} low-Ti continental flood basalt sequences exhibit a marked a silica gap from ∼ 55 – 65 wt. SiO 2, many incompatible element ratios, and the calculated eruption temperatures (950 – 1100 °C) are strikingly similar between the <b>rhyolites</b> and associated basalts. Using experimental evidence, derivation of the low-Ti <b>rhyolites</b> from a basaltic parent is shown to be a viable alternative to local crustal melting. Comparison of liquid compositions from experimental melting of both crustal and mantle-derived (basaltic) source materials allows the two to be distinguished on the basis of Al₂O₃ and FeO content. The basalt experiments are reversible, such that the same melts can be produced by melting or crystallisation. The effect of increased water content in the source is also detectable in the liquid composition. The majority of <b>rhyolites</b> from continental flood basalt provinces fall along the experimental trend for basalt melting/ crystallisation at relatively low water content. The onset of the silica gap in the <b>rhyolites</b> is accompanied by an abrupt decrease in TiO₂ and FeO*, marking the start of Fe–Ti oxide crystallisation. Differentiation from 55 – 65 wt. SiO₂ requires ∼ 30 fractional crystallisation in which magnetite is an important phase, sometimes accompanied by limited crustal contamination. The rapid increase in silica occurs over a small temperature interval and for relatively small changes in the amount of fractional crystallisation, thus intermediate compositions {{are less likely to be}} sampled. It is argued that the presence of a silica gap is not diagnostic of a crustal melting origin for either A-type granites or <b>rhyolites</b> in continental flood basalt provinces. The volume of these <b>rhyolites</b> erupted over the Phanerozoic is significant and models for crustal growth should take this substantial contribution from the mantle into account. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. – In Mexico, the topaz-bearing <b>rhyolites</b> occur {{mainly in}} the San Luis Potosi area (San Luis Potosi and Guanajuato States). These <b>rhyolites</b> appear as domes related to the Tertiary extensional tectonism. Three domes of the San Luis Potosi {{volcanic}} field were selected for study, according to the color, the habits {{and the size of}} the topaz they contain, in order to determine the characteristics of the lava and the growth conditions of the topaz. These <b>rhyolites</b> are high-silica, metaluminous to slightly peraluminous and alkali-rich lavas. They are enriched in fluorine and in incompati-ble lithophile elements such as Rb, Cs, Ta, U and Th and depleted in Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Ti and Ni. Therefore, they are very similar to the topaz-bearing <b>rhyolites</b> from western United States. In Cerro El Gato dome, both amber-colored and col-orless topazes crystallized in voids and fractures. Comparing these different crystals with respect to their growth envi-ronment, habits, chemical compositions and EPR characteristics provides an explanation for the crystallization conditions and color of topaz. Colorless topaz from Cerro El Gato crystallized at a temperature above 500 oC (lack of color centers) from fluids enriched in elements leached from the lava, whereas the amber-colored topaz crystallized be-low 500 oC (based on the presence of color centers) and from fluids richer in volatile elements (As). In Cerro El Lobo, the topaz have intermediate characteristics between the colorless and the amber-colored topazes of Cerro El Gato.
