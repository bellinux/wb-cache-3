Also, he's divorced, so he's <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> part of his family," [...] one of [...] "TV's funniest lines" [...] for the week ending October 3, 2005. Dan Phillips from IGN named [...] "Michael's Boner" [...] the tenth most awkward moment of the show, noting that, [...] "The camera holds the others' reactions just long enough to drive home the awkwardness of the scene, making you want to crawl inside of a hole {{along with the rest of}} the cast." ...|$|E

It's not an actual gay storyline, it's {{just kind of}} an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the movie, Gore {{discusses}} the scientific opinion on global warming, {{as well as}} the present and future effects of global warming and stresses that global warming [...] "is <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> political issue, so much as a moral one," [...] describing the consequences he believes global warming will produce if the amount of human-generated greenhouse gases is not significantly reduced in the very near future. Gore also presents Antarctic ice coring data showing CO2 levels higher now than in the past 650,000 years.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Hampp {{felt that}} [...] "for an album [...] {{inspired}} by performance art, {{it was the}} one moment where music and shock value merged indelibly and credibly." [...] The performance also received criticism for the vomiting act. Recovered bulimic Demi Lovato complained that the show [...] "glamorized" [...] eating disorders. In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News, [...] "I can understand why people would make that association, but my performance is <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> statement about eating disorders themselves." [...] Gaga confessed on Today, [...] "Millie and I know that not everybody's going to love that performance, but we both really believe in artistic expression and strong identities, and I support her and what she does. Artpop, my new album, is about bringing art and music together in the spirit of creative rebellion, and for us, that performance was art in its purest form." ...|$|E
500|$|When Robbie {{first began}} filming, {{she was told}} that Donna was bisexual. Of this Robbie said, [...] "In one of the blocks she is talking to Bridget about their 'first time' and Donna asks Bridget if {{it was with a}} guy or girl? I liked the way the writers {{conveyed}} that, it was just really subtle and they didn't make a big coming out scene of it. I think it's a good message to send out because it's not such a big deal to lots of people. Not all of them have such drama surrounding it". Donna's first storyline that included this aspect of her character was a kiss between herself and fellow female character, Sunny Lee (Hany Lee). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips, as it is her first kiss. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna as [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed saying [...] "It's <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{also held}} a one-off concert for ArtRave: The Artpop Ball inside a six-storey vending machine at Doritos' annual South by Southwest (SXSW) music festival at Austin, Texas. The city's Music and Entertainment {{division}} had initially denied permission to Gaga for playing inside the venue citing {{that it was}} for [...] "public safety concerns". Don Pitts from the division said that the venue being in close proximity with a parking lot was the reason they had to cancel Gaga's application. On March 6, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Gaga would indeed play at the venue. Tickets were sold to the fans through different competitions and challenges. Randal Lane from Forbes reported that the concert would support Gaga's Born This Way Foundation and charity events, but nevertheless opined that [...] "the way they're doling out the tickets is still crass". The concert was criticized when artist Millie Brown vomited a green liquid over Gaga during the performance of [...] "Swine" [...] from Artpop. The performance received complaints about [...] "glamorizing" [...] eating disorders. In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News: [...] "I can understand why people would make that association, but my performance is <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> statement about eating disorders themselves."

3000|$|Nevertheless, it is {{important}} to note that TCR is <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> informative measurement, as previously argued by Metsis et al. [38] and Cormack [22]. For instance, for Enron 4 (Table  5), MDL and SVM achieved similar performances ([...] MCC_MDL = 0.945 and [...] MCC_SVM = 0.978). However, their TCR are very different ([...] TCR_MDL = 34.615 and [...] TCR_SVM = 90.000), besides their precision × recall rates are very close.|$|R
2500|$|There are, however, some debates within {{religious}} groups {{about whether a}} childfree lifestyle is acceptable. Another view, for example, is that the biblical text Gen. 1:28 [...] "," [...] is <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> command but a blessing formula and that {{while there are many}} factors to consider as far as people's motives for remaining childless, there are many valid reasons, including dedicating one's time to demanding but good causes, why Christians may choose to remain childless for a short time or a lifetime. Matthew 19:12 describes Jesus as listing three types of eunuchs including one type who chooses it intentionally, noting that whoever is willing to become one, should. Furthermore, in two different places in the Bible, Luke as well as Matthew, Jesus himself warns against having children in the end times. Also, Jesus as well as Paul, to name a few of several men as well as women, are childless.|$|E
2500|$|Public {{perception}} is that Buss was instrumental in distancing the team from Jackson, including discounting his assistant Shaw from succeeding him as Lakers head coach. During his interview for the position, Shaw {{said he had to}} defend Jackson when Buss spoke negatively of their former coach. In a May 2011 interview, Jackson said [...] "there's <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> relationship" [...] with him and Buss. However, Buss in 2013 denied the perception of his relationship with Jackson. [...] "I have zero problem with Phil, and Phil has zero problem with me." [...] Buss said he would be fine if Jackson, who is engaged to Buss' sister Jeanie, was on the Lakers' payroll, but only as a consultant. According to Jeanie, Jackson served as an unofficial consultant: [...] "Phil {{is a part of the}} organization because of me ... Jim and Mitch know Phil is a phone call away." [...] Kupchak confirmed that he had interacted with Jackson on unspecified team issues. However, [...] Jackson did not envision a role on the team unless there was [...] "some seismic shift" [...] in the organization. Jeanie also said the Lakers were [...] "in good hands" [...] with Buss and Kupchak in their current roles. The Orange County Register, though, [...] wrote that [...] "many fans would love to imagine" [...] Jackson returning to the Lakers to replace Buss as the leader of basketball operations, and teaming with Jeanie to build a championship team. In 2014, public pressure mounted on the Buss family to hire Jackson, as he was discussing a front office position with the New York Knicks. However, the Lakers did not have a suitable front office role to offer him, and Jackson joined the Knicks as their president of basketball operations.|$|E
