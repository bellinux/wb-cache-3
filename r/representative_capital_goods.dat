Poor countries import most of their <b>capital</b> <b>goods.</b> We argue that interna-tional trade in <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> has quantitatively important effects on economic develop-ment through two channels: (i) capital formation and (ii) aggregate TFP. We embed a multi country, multi sector Ricardian model of trade into a neoclassical growth model. Barriers to trade result in a misallocation of factors both within and across countries. We calibrate the model to bilateral trade flows, prices, and income per worker. Our model matches several trade and development facts within a unified framework. It is consistent with the world distribution of <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> production, cross-country dif-ferences in investment rate and price of final goods, and cross-country equalization of price of <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> and marginal product of capital.
