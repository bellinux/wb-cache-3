25|$|When a thread—or in some cases, {{an entire}} forum—becomes unstable, {{the result is}} usually {{uncontrolled}} spam {{in the form of}} one-line complaints, image macros, or abuse of the <b>report</b> <b>system.</b> When the discussion becomes heated and sides do nothing more than complain and not accept each other's differences in point of view, the discussion degenerates into what is called a flame war. To flame someone means to go off-topic and attack the person rather than their opinion. Likely candidates for flame wars are usually religion and socio-political topics, or topics that discuss pre-existing rivalries outside the forum (e.g., rivalry between games, console systems, car manufacturers, nationalities, etc.).|$|E
25|$|There {{have long}} been {{allegations}} that volunteer DMOZ editors give favorable treatment to their own websites while concomitantly thwarting the good faith efforts of their competition. Such allegations are fielded by ODP's staff and meta editors, who {{have the authority to}} take disciplinary action against volunteer editors who are suspected of engaging in abusive editing practices. In 2003, DMOZ introduced a new Public Abuse <b>Report</b> <b>System</b> that allows members of the general public to report and track allegations of abusive editor conduct using an online form. Uninhibited discussion of DMOZ's purported shortcomings has become more common on mainstream Webmaster discussion forums. Although site policies suggest that an individual site should be submitted to only one category, as of October 2007, Topix.com, a news aggregation site operated by DMOZ founder Rich Skrenta, had more than 17,000 listings.|$|E
25|$|Forum {{rules are}} {{maintained}} and {{enforced by the}} moderation team, but users are allowed to help out via {{what is known as}} a <b>report</b> <b>system.</b> Most American forum software contains such a system. It consists of a small function applicable to each post (including one's own). Using it will notify all currently available moderators of its location, and subsequent action or judgment can be carried out immediately, which is particularly desirable in large or very developed boards. Generally, moderators encourage members to also use the private message system if they wish to report behavior. Moderators will generally frown upon attempts of moderation by non-moderators, especially when the would-be moderators do not even issue a report. Messages from non-moderators acting as moderators generally declare a post as against the rules, or predict punishment. While not harmful, statements that attempt to enforce the rules are discouraged.|$|E

MMR is updated based on if a player's team won or lost, which will then increase or decrease respectively. The game's servers, known as the [...] "Game Coordinator", attempts to balance both teams based on each player's MMR, with each team having roughly a 50% chance to win in any given game. Ranked game modes with a separately tracked MMR are also available, which primarily differ from unranked games by making MMR publicly visible, as well as requiring the registration of a phone number to their accounts, which help foster a more competitive environment. To ensure that each player's ranking is up to date and accurate, MMR is recalibrated every six months. The highest ranked MMR players are listed by Valve on an online leaderboard, which lists the 200 highest for each region. The game also {{includes a}} <b>report</b> <b>system,</b> which allows players to punish player behavior that intentionally provides a negative experience. Other features include an improved replay system from Defense of the Ancients, in which a completed game can be downloaded in-client and viewed by anyone at a later time, and the [...] "hero builds" [...] feature, which provide integrated guides created by the community that highlight to the player on how to play their hero.|$|E

The outcome of this measuring {{is referred to as}} Real-time Application monitoring (aka Top Down monitoring), which has two components, passive and active. Passive monitoring is usually an agentless appliance implemented using network port mirroring. A key feature to consider in this solution is the ability to support multiple protocol analytics (e.g., XML, SQL, PHP) since most companies have more than just web-based applications to support. Active monitoring, on the other hand, consists of synthetic probes and web robots predefined to <b>report</b> <b>system</b> availability and business transactions. Active monitoring is a good complement to passive monitoring; together, these two components help provide visibility into application health during off peak hours when transaction volume is low.|$|E
