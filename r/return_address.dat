5|$|While {{keeping his}} {{involvement}} with Waters's underground filmmaking a secret from his parents, Divine continued relying on them financially, charging them for expensive parties that he held and writing bad checks. After charging them for a major repair to his car in 1972, his parents confiscated it from {{him and told him}} that they would not continue to financially support him in such a manner. In retaliation, he came by their house the following day, collected his two pet dogs and then disappeared, not seeing or speaking with them for the next nine years. Instead, he sent them over fifty postcards from across the world, informing them that he was fine, but on none did he leave a <b>return</b> <b>address.</b> Frances and Harris Milstead retired soon after and moved to Florida at the advice of Harris's doctor, who prescribed the southern state's warmer weather as being beneficial for Harris's muscular dystrophy.|$|E
25|$|The Intel 8051, {{contrary}} to other Intel processors, expects 16-bit addresses for LJMP and LCALL in big-endian format; however, xCALL instructions store the <b>return</b> <b>address</b> onto the stack in little-endian format.|$|E

Visual Basic 5 also had support for OBJPTR (...) to <b>return</b> the <b>address</b> {{of an object}} interface, and for an ADDRESSOF operator to <b>return</b> the <b>address</b> of a function. The types {{of all of these}} are integers, but their values are equivalent to those held by pointer types.|$|R

25|$|David Wheeler, {{who earned}} the world's first Computer Science PhD {{working on the}} project, is {{credited}} with inventing {{the concept of a}} subroutine. Users wrote programs that called a routine by jumping {{to the start of the}} subroutine with the <b>return</b> <b>address</b> (i.e. the location-plus-one of the jump itself) in the accumulator (a Wheeler jump). By convention the subroutine expected this and the first thing it did was to modify its concluding jump instruction to that <b>return</b> <b>address.</b> Multiple and nested subroutines could be called so long as the user knew the length of each one in order to calculate the location to jump to; recursive calls were forbidden. The user then copied the code for the subroutine from a master tape onto their own tape following the end of their own program.|$|E

[...] The difference, the court reasoned, is that <b>return</b> <b>addresses</b> are not required to mail a letter, yet IP addresses are required to go online. [...] Disclosure to third parties, when required to obtain service, does not waive the expectation that the disclosed information not be shared with other individuals or entities.|$|R
25|$|Any {{letter sent}} within Canada has the {{destination}} {{address on the}} centre of its envelope, with a stamp, postal indicia, meter label, or frank mark on the top-right corner of the envelope to acknowledge payment of postage.

25|$|NTP {{has been}} used in {{distributed}} denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A small query is sent to an NTP server with the <b>return</b> <b>address</b> spoofed to be the target address. Similar to the DNS amplification attack, the server responds with a much larger reply that allows an attacker to substantially increase the amount of data being sent to the target. To avoid participating in an attack, servers can be configured to ignore external queries, or they can be upgraded to version 4.2.7p26 or later.|$|E
25|$|Later Julieta collapses in {{the street}} but is seen by a newly-returned Lorenzo. He visits her flat where he finds a letter from Antía, which he brings to Julieta - along with her memoir, {{apparently}} unread. Antía speaks {{of the death of}} her son, which has deeply affected her and allowed her to understand how Julieta must feel at their separation. She has also included a <b>return</b> <b>address.</b> Lorenzo and Julieta drive to Switzerland and Julieta resolves not to demand an explanation, simply wishing to be with her daughter.|$|E
50|$|In simple {{languages}} like Forth {{that lack}} local variables and naming of parameters, stack frames would contain {{nothing more than}} <b>return</b> branch <b>addresses</b> and frame management overhead. So their return stack holds bare <b>return</b> <b>addresses</b> rather than frames. The return stack is separate from the data value stack, to improve the flow of call setup and returns.|$|R

25|$|On March 3, 2007, an American Greetings Christmas card {{sent to the}} Chronicle, postmarked 1990 in Eureka had {{recently}} been discovered in their photo files by editorial assistant Daniel King. Inside the envelope, with the card, was a photocopy of two U.S. Postal keys on a magnet keychain. The handwriting on the envelope resembles Zodiac's print, but was declared inauthentic by forensic document examiner Lloyd Cunningham. However, not all Zodiac experts agree with Cunningham's analysis. There is no <b>return</b> <b>address</b> on the envelope nor is his crossed-circle signature to be found. The card itself is unmarked. The Chronicle turned over all the material to the Vallejo Police Department for further analysis.|$|E
25|$|In New York, {{she worked}} as an artist's model and {{was said to have}} moved in New York's social circles. As a German agent her mission was to find her targets at New York nightclubs, sleep with these men, and attempt to {{blackmail}} them or otherwise entice them to give up valuable secrets. One FBI agent described her as a “good-looking nymphomaniac”. Stein {{was one of the people}} to whom Sebold had been instructed to deliver microphotograph instructions upon his arrival in the United States. She frequently met with Sebold to give him information for transmittal to Germany, and her address was used as a <b>return</b> <b>address</b> by other agents in mailing data for Germany.|$|E
25|$|By 2004, the {{investigation}} of the BTK Killer was cold. Then, Rader began a series of 11 communications to the local media that led directly to his arrest in February 2005. In March 2004, The Wichita Eagle received a letter from someone using the <b>return</b> <b>address</b> Bill Thomas Killman. The author of the letter claimed that he had murdered Vicki Wegerle on September 16, 1986, and enclosed photographs of the crime scene and a photocopy of her driver's license, which had been stolen {{at the time of the}} crime. Before this, it was not definitively established that Wegerle was killed by BTK. DNA collected from under Wegerle's fingernails provided police with previously unknown evidence. They then began DNA testing hundreds of men in an effort to find the serial killer. Altogether, over 1300 DNA samples were taken and later destroyed by court order.|$|E
50|$|The stack is {{only used}} to store <b>return</b> <b>addresses</b> when subroutines are called. The {{original}} 1802 version allocated 48 bytes {{for up to}} 24 levels of nesting; modern implementations normally have at least 16 levels.|$|R
40|$|The ICAT {{statistics}} {{over the}} past few years have shown at least one out of every five CVE and CVE candidate vulnerabilities have been due to buffer overflows. This constitutes a significant portion of today’s computer related security concerns. In this paper we introduce a novel method for detecting stack smashing and buffer overflow attacks. Our runtime method extracts <b>return</b> <b>addresses</b> from the program call stack and uses these <b>return</b> <b>addresses</b> to extract their corresponding invoked addresses from memory. We demonstrate how these <b>return</b> and invoked <b>addresses</b> can be represented as a directed weighted graph and used in the detection of stack smashing attacks. We introduce the concept of a Greedy Hamiltonian Call Path and show how the lack of such a path can be used to detect stack-smashing attacks...|$|R

500|$|In February 1832 Balzac {{received}} an intriguing letter from Odessa—with no <b>return</b> <b>address</b> and signed simply [...] "L'Étrangère" [...] ("The Foreigner")—expressing sadness at the cynicism and atheism in La Peau de Chagrin and its negative portrayal of women. His {{response was to}} place a classified advertisement in the Gazette de France, hoping that his anonymous critic would see it.

An envelope, postmarked in Warsaw and addressed to [...] "Johny K.", [...] the site's post office box in Helsingborg, with no <b>return</b> <b>address,</b> contained [...] "a really weird CD" [...] (actually a DVD). On it was written an alphanumeric string long enough to require two lines. At first he assumed it was a product key.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 2016 Intel is {{developing}} a Control-flow enforcement technology (CET) to help mitigate and prevent stack-hopping exploits, which works by implementing a shadow-stack held inside the RAM which will only contain <b>return</b> <b>addresses,</b> protected by the CPU's Memory management unit.|$|R
50|$|In computing, Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) is a method, {{defined in}} an Internet Draft, for {{determining}} whether the bounce address specified in an E-mail message is valid.

50|$|Overfilling {{a buffer}} {{allocated}} on the stack {{is more likely}} to influence program execution than overfilling a buffer on the heap because the stack contains the <b>return</b> <b>addresses</b> for all active function calls. However, similar implementation-specific protections also exist against heap-based overflows.|$|R
500|$|On 28 February 1832 Hańska {{posted a}} letter from Odessa with no <b>return</b> <b>address.</b> In it, she praised Balzac for his work, but scolded him for the {{negative}} portrayal of women in La Peau de chagrin. She urged {{a return to the}} glowing representations in his earlier novels, and signed enigmatically: [...] "L'Étrangère" [...] ("The Stranger" [...] or [...] "The Foreigner"). Balzac was intrigued by the letter; he took out a personal advertisement in the Gazette de France indicating his receipt of an anonymous letter and expressing regret for being unable to reply. She probably never saw this notice.|$|E
500|$|With no <b>return</b> <b>address,</b> Balzac {{was left}} to reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice.

50|$|The calling {{convention}} for C functions on the LC-3 {{is similar to}} that implemented by other systems, such as the x86 ISA. When running C programs, the architecture maintains a memory model that includes space for a call stack and dynamic memory allocation. In this model, four of the processor's eight general purpose registers take on special roles: R4 is used as a base register for loading and storing global data, R5 is used to point to the current function's area on the call stack, and R6 is used as a stack pointer. Additionally, R7 is usually reserved for storage of <b>return</b> <b>addresses</b> from function calls; the JSR, JSRR, and TRAP instructions automatically store <b>return</b> <b>addresses</b> in this register during their execution.|$|R
50|$|A {{black hole}} {{e-mail address is}} an e-mail address which is valid (messages sent to it will not {{generate}} errors), but to which all messages sent are automatically deleted, and never stored or seen by humans. These addresses are often used as <b>return</b> <b>addresses</b> for automated e-mails.|$|R
40|$|Garbage {{collection}} {{tables for}} finding pointers on the stack {{can be represented}} in 20 - 25 % of the space previously reported. Live pointer information is often the same at many call sites because there are few pointers live across most call sites. This allows live pointer information to be represented compactly by a small index into a table of descriptions of pointer locations. The mapping from program counter values to those small indexes can be represented compactly using several techniques. The techniques all assign numbers to call sites and use those numbers to index an array of small indexes. One technique is to represent an array of <b>return</b> <b>addresses</b> by using a two-level table with 16 -bit offsets. Another technique {{is to use a}} sparse array of <b>return</b> <b>addresses</b> and interpolate the exact number via disassembly of the executable code. 1...|$|R
