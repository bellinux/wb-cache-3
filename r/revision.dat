40|$|Abstract: <b>Revisions</b> to GDP {{announcements}} {{are known}} to be quite large in all G- 7 countries: many <b>revisions</b> in quarterly GDP growth are over a full percentage point at an annualized rate. In this paper, we examine the predictability of these data <b>revisions.</b> Previous work suggests that U. S. GDP <b>revisions</b> are largely unpredictable, as would be the case if the <b>revisions</b> reflect news not available {{at the time that the}} preliminary number is produced. We nd that the degree of predictability varies throughout the G- 7. For the U. S., the <b>revisions</b> are very slightly predictable, but for Italy, Japan and the UK, about half the variability of subsequent <b>revisions</b> can be accounted for by information available at the time of the preliminary announcement. For these countries, it appears that <b>revisions</b> reflect, to a signicant degree, the removal of noise from the preliminary numbers, rather than the arrival of news...|$|R
40|$|Releases of the GDP {{are subject}} to <b>revisions</b> over time. This paper {{examines}} the predictability of German GDP <b>revisions</b> using forecast rationality tests. Previous studies of German GDP covering data until 1997 finds that <b>revisions</b> of real seasonally adjusted GDP are predictable. This paper uses a newly available real-time data to analyze the <b>revisions</b> of real seasonal adjusted GDP, of nominal unadjusted GDP, of the seasonal pattern, and of the GDP deflator for the period between 1992 and 2006. We find that the <b>revisions</b> of the nominal unadjusted GDP are unpredictable, but that the <b>revisions</b> of the price adjustments are predictable. Nevertheless, <b>revisions</b> of real seasonally adjusted GDP are hardly predictable and less well predictable compared to earlier studies. This lower predictability seems {{to be linked to}} the finding that <b>revisions</b> of seasonal adjustments are hardly predictable, too, and that their predictability decreased over time...|$|R

40|$|Maintainers {{face the}} {{daunting}} task of wading through {{a collection of}} both new and old <b>revisions,</b> trying to ferret out <b>revisions</b> which warrant personal inspection. One can rank <b>revisions</b> by size/lines of code (LOC), but often, due to the distribution of the size of changes, <b>revisions</b> will be of similar size. If we can’t rank <b>revisions</b> by LOC perhaps we can rank by Halstead’s and McCabe’s complexity metrics? However, these metrics are problematic when applied to code fragments (<b>revisions)</b> written in multiple languages: special parsers are required which may not support the language or dialect used; analysis tools may not understand code fragments. We propose using the statistical moments of indentation as a lightweight, language independent, revision/diff friendly metric which actually proxies classical complexity metrics. We have extensively evaluated our approach against the entire CVS histories of the 278 of the most popular and most active SourceForge projects. We found that our results are linearly correlated and rankcorrelated with traditional measures of complexity, suggesting that measuring indentation is a cheap and accurate proxy for code complexity of <b>revisions.</b> Thus ranking <b>revisions</b> by the standard deviation and summation of indentation will be very similar to ranking <b>revisions</b> by complexity. ...|$|R
