2500|$|GamesRadar's Brent Goodsmith {{scored the}} game 4 out of 5. He {{felt it was}} a button masher, arguing that attacking [...] "is {{executed}} via the trusted medium of button bashing. The developers will hate us for saying this, because they've pointed out to us on multiple occasions the non-bashy, all-skillsy nature of Spartan: Total Warriors combat." [...] However, he didn't see this as an inherent problem; [...] "regardless of how it is achieved, the result is much the same: oodles of rapid-fire killing and the satisfaction of hacking up enemies more numerous than in any console action game that has gone before." [...] He concluded [...] "Spartan does things <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> that the première hack-and-slash series Dynasty Warriors, about to release its tenth PS2 entry, has yet to achieve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Now mind you, {{not one of}} us {{knew that}} Dave Walsh was dead. We thought he was on the Glendale, bound for Dawson. The missionary had edged off to one side, and so Flush of Gold faced the box when it struck. It was like in a play. It couldn’t have been better planned. It struck on end, and on the right end; the whole front of the box came off; and out swept Dave Walsh on his feet, partly wrapped in a blanket, his yellow hair flying and showing bright in the sun. <b>Right</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>box,</b> on his feet, he swept upon Flush of Gold. She didn’t know he was dead, but it was unmistakable, after hanging up two days on a timber jam, that he was rising all right from the dead to claim her. Possibly that is what she thought. At any rate, the sight froze her. She couldn’t move. She just sort of wilted and watched Dave Walsh coming for her! And he got her. It looked almost as though he threw his arms around her, but whether or not this happened, down to the deck they went together. We had to drag Dave Walsh’s body clear before we could get hold of her. She was in a faint, {{but it would have been}} just as well if she had never come out of that faint; for when she did, she fell to {{screaming}} the way insane people do. She kept it up for hours, till she was exhausted. Oh, yes, she recovered. You saw her last night, and know how much recovered she is. She is not violent, it is true, but she lives in darkness. She believes that she is waiting for Dave Walsh, and so she waits in the cabin he built for her. She is no longer fickle. It is nine years now that she has been faithful to Dave Walsh, and the outlook is that she’ll be faithful to him to the end.” ...|$|E
