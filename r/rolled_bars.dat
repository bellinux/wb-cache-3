40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this work}} has been to develop an {{automatic}} roll pass design method, capable of minimizing the number of roll passes. The adoption of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly expert systems, and a hybrid model for the surface profile evaluation of <b>rolled</b> <b>bars,</b> has allowed us to model {{the search for the}} minimal sequence with a tree path search. This approach permitted a geometrical optimization of roll passes while allowing automation of the roll pass design process. Moreover, the heuristic nature of the inferential engine contributes a great deal toward reducing search time, thus allowing such a system to be employed for industrial purposes. Finally, this new approach was compared with other recently developed automatic systems to validate and measure possible improvements among them...|$|E

Cold drawn bars has shown higher strength values when compared with the hot <b>rolled</b> <b>bars.</b> This is because of the type of process selected for manufacturing.

40|$|During {{the past}} 40 years in Germany some serious damages in post- and {{pre-tensioned}} components have been occurred because of {{stress corrosion cracking}} of prestressing steel. Especially those problems caused a great stir, where the attendant circumstances of design, execution and building materials were not unusual. But the prestressing steel was unsuited to resist the inevitable conditions on construction site and inside the construction. Therefore some important measures and corrections were introduced to reduce number of damages related to stress corrosion cracking. They include improved standards and recommendations for planning and executions of new constructions and for strengthening of older ones. Research was done to de-velop non-destructive measuring techniques to investigate older prestressed constructions. With regard to building materials such materials which not guarantee durable protection of the embedded steel had been forbidden and a steady control prevents that unwelcome materials can come on the market. As well as hot <b>rolled</b> <b>bars,</b> the quenched and tempered wires and the cold deformed wires and strands had been improved in the last 40 years. 218 Otto-Graf-Journal Vol. 9, 1998 ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Corrosion induced failure in prestressed concrete structures and preventative measures Innerhalb der letzten 40 Jahre kam es in Deutschland zu einigen schwerwiegenden Schäden in Spannbetonbauteilen mit sofortigem und nachträglichem Verbund, die auf Spannungsrißkorrosion der Spannstähle zurückgeführt werden konnten.

40|$|The {{so-called}} <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> measurement uses a {{heavy metal}} material, optically thick to x-rays, {{to form a}} shadow of the x-ray origination spot. This spot is where an energetic electron beam interacts with a high Z target. The material (the "roll bar") is slightly curved to avoid alignment problems. The <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> is constructed and positioned so that the x-rays are shadowed in the horizontal and vertical directions, so information is obtained in two dimensions. If a beam profile is assumed (or measured by other means), the equivalent x-ray spot size can be calculated from the x-ray shadow cast by the <b>roll</b> <b>bar.</b> Thus the ellipticity of the beam can be calculated, assuming the ellipse of the x-ray spot is aligned with the <b>roll</b> <b>bar.</b> The data is recorded using a scintillator and gated camera.
