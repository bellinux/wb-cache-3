The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified {{around the perimeter of}} the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that it was just as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the <b>right</b> <b>time</b> later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E

40|$|Sea stars {{typically}} {{live with}} their oral side facing the substratum, {{and the ability to}} right themselves when turned over is important response to avoid desiccation and predation. The <b>righting</b> <b>time</b> of 8 species of sea stars; Henricia leviuscula (3 color variations), Henricia pumila sp. nov., Leptasterias hexactis, Pyconopodia helianthoides, Pisaster ochraceus, and Pteraster tesselatus were tested on two different substrata to determine if it affects <b>righting</b> <b>time.</b> The <b>righting</b> <b>times</b> were measured when sea stars were placed with their aboral side on the substratum in two different tanks, one covered with sand and another with no sediment. Since podia adhesion to the substratum is required for a sea star to right itself, it was expected that substrata with a smaller grain size would cause an increase in <b>righting</b> <b>time</b> compared to a flatter surface. Sea star diameter was measured to determine the correlation between size and <b>righting</b> <b>time.</b> Leading arm identification was also observed to test the initiating arm preference. P. tesselatus was the only species that was unable to right itself in sand. In most species, sand increased the average <b>righting</b> <b>time</b> compared to other substrata. Individuals with a larger diameter were found to have an increased <b>righting</b> <b>time.</b> No significant relationship was found to which arm initiated the response in all individuals. This study helps to add to the minimal knowledge of this unusual behavior of echinoderms...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Righting {{behavior}} was {{examined in the}} asteroids Henricia leviuscula and Leptasterias aequalis by repeating a standard laboratory righting trial {{with a large number}} of individuals of each species, and analyzing the observations made by statistical methods. Detailed observations on the righting method, including leading pairs of arms and <b>righting</b> <b>time</b> were made. The relationship between body size and <b>righting</b> <b>time,</b> and the effect of mechanical stimulation on leading arms was analyzed. Both species used somersaulting in righting. The folding over method, and a combination of folding over followed by somersaulting were only used by L. aequalis. Somersaulting appears to be characteristic of the entire class Asteroidea. Both species are active during the pre-righting period, suggesting that there is no quiescent period. The righting response was present in H. leviuscula {{at the beginning of the}} righting reaction; in L. aequalis, it appeared later. Suppression of activity of tube feet of non-leading arms plays an important part in the first movements of the righting reaction. There was a leading pair of arms in both H. leviuscula and L. aequalis. In both species, the preference for certain arm pairs to lead in the righting reaction is a species rather than an individual characteristic. Leading arms are not adjacent to the madreporite. The preference for a specific pair of arms is not due to the length of the arms or greater number of tube feet, since the leading arms were the same length as the non-leading arms. The <b>time</b> required for <b>righting</b> in both species was very variable. The average <b>time</b> taken for <b>righting</b> was 230 seconds in H. leviuscula and 181 seconds for L. aequalis. Differences in <b>righting</b> <b>time</b> between species appears to be an expression of the differences in morphology rather than environmental variables or behavioral modes. In both species, there was a significant relationship between the body size and the <b>righting</b> <b>time,</b> with smaller individuals righting faster than larger. H. leviuscula took longer <b>times</b> to <b>right</b> in successive trials, even with six and 12 hour rest intervals between trials. This increase in <b>righting</b> <b>time</b> may be due to a process similar to habituation. The same phenomena was not observed in L. aequalis. Mechanical stimulation affected the arms used in righting in L. aequalis. The arm used to turn the sea star over was used less frequently as a leading arm. No such effects were observed in H. leviuscula. A righting reaction is of obvious survival advantage because both species live on intertidal rocky shore areas which are exposed to heavy wave action. Since there was no difference in the <b>righting</b> <b>time</b> between the somersaulting and folding over method in L. aequalis, neither method would appear to be more advantageous for survival in nature...|$|R

5|$|As a {{survival}} horror game, Revelations emphasizes survival, evasion, and exploration over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. The player {{has the ability to}} run, climb ladders, swim and dive underwater for a limited period of time. Up to three firearms can be carried at one time, in addition to grenades and the standard combat knife. Firearms range from handguns to shotguns, submachine guns and rifles. When aiming a firearm to shoot enemies, the gameplay switches into a first-person perspective. Playing as Jill, the player can upgrade firearms by finding special items throughout the game. The player may also perform melee attacks when an enemy has been stunned after being shot at the <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> Ammunition and health suppliers are dispersed among the game to help players increase their resources. A device called Genesis can be used to scan and find items hidden throughout the game's environments. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the game.|$|E

5|$|The year of 1967 started {{badly for}} the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). During {{the early years}} of the war, the rules of {{engagement}} prevented U.S. fighter-bombers from hitting North Vietnamese air bases, and that allowed North Vietnamese fighter pilots to attack American bomber formations as they were approaching their targets, thereby forcing U.S. pilots to jettison their bomb loads before they even reached their target. Then, instead of dueling with U.S. strike aircraft, North Vietnamese pilots would normally retreat to the safety of their bases. To preempt further attacks on U.S. bomber formations by the North Vietnamese Air Force, the United States Air Force became interested in luring North Vietnamese MiG fighters up against a decoy target, and shoot them down in the air using missile-armed fighter aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force had become more aggressive towards U.S. strike formations, and it indicated to U.S. commanders that it was the <b>right</b> <b>time</b> to launch a decoy operation.|$|E
5|$|Dominican missionaries {{were active}} in Verapaz and the {{southern}} Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success. In the 17th century the Franciscans {{came to the conclusion}} that the pacification and Christian conversion of the Maya would not be possible as long as the Itza held out at Lake Petén Itzá. The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the encomiendas. Fray Bartolomé de Fuensalida visited Nojpetén in 1618 and 1619. The Franciscan missionaries attempted to use their own reinterpretation of the k'atun prophecies when they visited Nojpetén at this time, to convince the current Aj Kan Ek' and his Maya priesthood that the time for conversion had come. But the Itza priesthood interpreted the prophecies differently, and the missionaries were fortunate to escape with their lives. In 1695 the colonial authorities decided to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucatán, and Guatemalan soldiers conquered a number of Ch'ol communities, the most important being Sakb'ajlan on the Lacantún River in eastern Chiapas, now in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra Señora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon. The Franciscan friar Andrés de Avendaño oversaw a second attempt to overcome the Itza in 1695, convincing the Itza king that the K'atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year Maya calendrical cycle beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the <b>right</b> <b>time</b> for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord. However the Itza had local Maya enemies who resisted this conversion, and in 1696 Avendaño was fortunate to escape with his life. The Itza's continued resistance had become a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander.

Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E

5|$|Unknown to the Franciscans, the {{northern}} Chak'an Itza {{province of the}} Itza kingdom was allied with the Kowoj and was {{at war with the}} Itza king. The Chak'an Itzas carried off most of the gifts that the Spanish party had brought for the Itza king, in an effort to hinder friendly relations developing. The following day, the current Aj Kan Ek' travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors at the Chak'an Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake Petén Itza. The Franciscans returned to Nojpetén with Kan Ek' and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avendaño tried to convince Kan Ek' to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish crown, without success. The Franciscan friar tried to convince the Itza king that the K'atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year Maya calendrical cycle beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the <b>right</b> <b>time</b> for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord.

5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated.

Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage of this would be rewarded.
