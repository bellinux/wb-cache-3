His diary of planting and care was published as Gravetye Manor, or Twenty Years of the Work round an old Manor House (1911).

2500|$|Captain Fredrick W. Beechey in 1827 {{traveling}} with the hills on their right, known in that part as the Sierra del Sur, began to approach the road, which passing over a small eminence, opened out upon [...] "a wide country of meadow land, with clusters of fine oak free from underwood… It strongly resembled a nobleman's park: herds of cattle and horses were grazing upon the <b>rich</b> <b>pasture,</b> and numerous fallow‑deer, startled at the approach of strangers, bounded off to seek protection among the hills… This spot is named San Matheo, and belongs to the mission of San Francisco." [...] An 1835 sketch map of the Rancho refers to the creek as Arroyo de Los Laureles. In the 21st century, most of the laurels are gone, removed for development.|$|E

2500|$|The moor {{consists}} of rich alluvial soil {{on a bed}} of clay, a soil which is much more thick and naturally fertile compared to most of the patchy humus in the topsoil in the large historic parishes to the east such as Ashford, Stanwell, Harmondsworth, Bedfont and Feltham, which have thin, less moist humus on gravel-rich clay, formed by the ancient terraces of the Thames {{in the same way as}} the inland parts of the riverside parishes. [...] As such <b>rich</b> <b>pasture</b> is the primary use of the land. [...] Meads would be a more accurate term, as moor implies stony land or waste (infertile land). [...] In the far south of the area mill mead was between two stream channels of the river, where the shopping centre Two Rivers has been built.|$|E

60|$|Grass Valley widened to the southeast. Jean {{would have}} been {{backward}} about estimating the square miles in it. Yet it was not vast acreage so much as <b>rich</b> <b>pasture</b> that made it such a wonderful range. Several ranches lay along the western slope of this section. Jean was informed that open parks and swales, and little valleys nestling among the foothills, wherever there was water and grass, had been settled by ranchers. Every summer a few new families ventured in.|$|E
60|$|One day I {{was coming}} back from Balsora, whither I had taken a supply of goods, {{intended}} for India, and halted at noon in a lonely place, which promised <b>rich</b> <b>pasture</b> for my camels. I was resting in the shade under a tree, when a dervish, going on foot towards Balsora, sat down by my side, and I inquired whence he had come and to what place he was going. We soon made friends, and after we had asked each other the usual questions, we produced the food we had with us, and satisfied our hunger.|$|E

60|$|These Scots runts, so {{they call}} them, {{coming out of}} the cold and barren {{mountains}} of the Highlands in Scotland, feed so eagerly on the <b>rich</b> <b>pasture</b> in these marshes, that they thrive in an unusual manner, and grow monstrously fat; and the beef is so delicious for taste, that the inhabitants prefer them to the English cattle, which are much larger and fairer to look at; and they may very well do so. Some have told me, and I believe with good judgment, that there are above forty thousand of these Scots cattle fed in this county every year, and most of them in the said marshes between Norwich, Beccles, and Yarmouth.|$|E
6000|$|I {{must not}} omit {{to mention that}} this village is the paradise of cows as well as men; indeed you would almost suppose the cow {{to be as much}} an object of worship here as the bull was among the ancient Egyptians; and well does she merit it, for she is in fact the patroness of the place. The same scrupulous cleanliness, however, which pervades {{everything}} else, is manifested in the treatment of this venerated animal. She is not permitted to perambulate the place, but in winter, when she forsakes the <b>rich</b> <b>pasture,</b> a well-built house is provided for her, well painted, and maintained in the most perfect order. Her stall is of ample dimensions; the floor is scrubbed and polished; her hide is daily curried and brushed and sponged to her heart's content, and her tail is daintily tucked up to the ceiling, and decorated with a ribbon! ...|$|E
60|$|Little of the {{building}} remained, {{only a few of}} the cloister arches, and the stumps of broken columns to mark the form of the chapel; but the arch of the west window was complete, and the wreaths of ivy hid its want of tracery, while a red Virginian creeper mantled the wall. All was calm and still, the greensward smooth and carefully mown, not a nettle or thistle visible, but the floriated crosses on the old stone coffin lids showing clearly above the level turf, shaded by a few fine old trees, while the river glided smoothly along under the broad floating water-lily leaves, and on its other side the green lawn was repeated, cattle quietly grazing on the <b>rich</b> <b>pasture,</b> shut in by the gently rising woods. The declining sun cast its long shadows, and all was peace,--the only sounds, the robin's note and the ripple of the stream.|$|E
50|$|Long before Western settlement, this east-facing glen {{was home}} to prosperous herders, the Khoi-Khoi, who pastured their {{livestock}} in <b>rich</b> <b>pastures</b> {{along the banks of}} the “Couga River”. The river flows south towards the marsh Botrivier estuary, and was for centuries the home of contented tribes who savoured the privilege of fresh waters in the water-scarce Cape.|$|R
50|$|Considerable {{herds of}} cattle were reared on the <b>rich</b> <b>pastures</b> {{of the lower}} Rhine, {{but the number of}} sheep in the {{province}} was comparatively small, not greatly in excess of that of the goats.

60|$|The major made no reply, {{but he felt}} to {{ascertain}} if his arms were in a state for immediate service. After a moment's further pause the captain proceeded, moving with increased caution. Not a word was now uttered, for they were getting within {{the shadows of the}} orchard, and indeed of the forest, where objects could not well be distinguished at the distance of a very few yards. A cabin was soon reached, and it was found empty; the fire reduced to a few embers, and quite safe. This was the residence of the man who had the care of the horses, the stables standing directly behind it. Captain Willoughby was a thoughtful and humane man, and it struck him the animals might now be turned into a field that joined the barn-yard, where there was not only <b>rich</b> <b>pasture,</b> but plenty of sweet running water. This he determined to do at once, the only danger being from the unbridled movements of cattle that must be impatient from unusual privation, and a prolonged restraint.|$|E
60|$|Even Moses had his {{patience}} worn out by their fretful faithlessness, and committed {{an act of}} disobedience, {{for which he was}} sentenced not to enter the land, but to die on the borders after one sight of the promise of his fathers. Under him, however, began the work of conquest; the <b>rich</b> <b>pasture</b> lands of Gilead and Basan were subdued, and the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, were permitted to take these as their inheritance, though beyond the proper boundary, the Jordan. The Moabites took alarm, though these, as descended from Abraham's nephew Lot, were to be left unharmed; and their king, Balak, sent, as it appears, even to Mesopotamia for Balaam, a true prophet, though a guilty man, in hopes that he would bring down the curse of God on them. Balaam, greedy of reward, forced, as it were, consent from God to go to Balak, though warned that his words would not be in his own power. As he stood on the hill top with Balak, vainly endeavouring to curse, a glorious stream of blessing flowed from his lips, revealing, not only the fate of all the tribes around, even for a thousand years, but proclaiming the Sceptre and Star that should rise out of Jacob to execute vengeance on his foes. But finding himself unable to curse Israel, the miserable prophet devised a surer means of harming them: he sent tempters among them to cause them to corrupt themselves, and so effectual was this invention, that the greater part of the tribe of Simeon were ensnared, and a great plague was sent in chastisement. It was checked by the zeal of the young priest, Phineas, under whose avenging hand so many of the guilty tribe fell, that their numbers never recovered the blow. Then after a prayer of atonement, a great battle was fought, and the wretched Balaam was among the slain.|$|E

50|$|Before it {{was settled}} as a town the Yalgoo area {{was used as}} grazing land for European {{settlers}} including the Morrissey and Broad families.
