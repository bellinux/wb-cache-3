5|$|The NSWRL were {{reluctant}} to admit a ninth team into the premiership and proposed they merge with nearby team Western Suburbs. However, the clubs involved declined so the NSWRL agreed to allowing the Cumberland team to a trial match against Eastern Suburbs. While Eastern Suburbs won the match 18–4, the NSWRL was convinced of {{that they could be}} competitive. As the NSWRL premiership had already begun, the NSWRL had to <b>reformat</b> the draw to include Cumberland, which meant increasing the number of teams from eight to nine. Cumberland did not have a home ground, like some of the other teams, and would play their games at the Agricultural Ground, Birchgrove Oval and Wentworth Park.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare between Valvassori and Cincinnati {{criteria}} and to correlate between vestibular aqueduct measurements made in axial plane with those made in 45 ° oblique <b>reformats.</b> Patients and methods: The study group included 61 children with LVAS. All participants were subjected to full Audiological evaluation and MDCT scanning in axial plane. The axial data were transferred to workstation for post-processing with multiplanar <b>reformatting</b> software in order to obtain the 45 ° oblique <b>reformats.</b> Vestibular aqueduct measurements were made at 4 points: midpoint and operculum in both the axial plane and 45 ° oblique <b>reformats.</b> Results: 100 % (122 ears) were diagnosed according to Cincinnati criteria, while 81 % (99 ears) of children with LVAS fit Valvassori criterion, and 19 % were (23 ears) missed. There were statistically significant correlations among the diameters of the VA in the axial plane (midpoint and operculum) and their counterparts in the 45 ° oblique <b>reformats.</b> Values equal to or greater than 1. 2  mm in the midpoint and 1. 3  mm in the operculum are proposed to be the criteria to diagnose LVA in the 45 ° oblique <b>reformats.</b> Conclusion: Cincinnati criteria are more sensitive than Valvassori criteria in the diagnosis of LVAS...|$|R

25|$|Nevertheless, {{in order}} to be fully {{compliant}} with the SDXC card specification, many SDXC-capable host devices are firmware-programmed to expect exFAT on cards larger than 32GB. Consequently, they may not accept SDXC cards reformatted as FAT32, even if the device supports FAT32 on smaller cards (for SDHC compatibility). Therefore, even if a file system is supported in general, it is not always possible to use alternative file systems on SDXC cards at all depending on how strictly the SDXC card specification has been implemented in the host device. This bears a risk of accidental loss of data, as a host device may treat a card with an unrecognized file system as blank or damaged and <b>reformat</b> the card.|$|E
25|$|With {{the release}} of Word 6.0 in 1993, Microsoft again {{attempted}} to synchronize the version numbers and coordinate product naming across platforms, this time across DOS, Mac OS, and Windows (this was the last version of Word for DOS). It introduced AutoCorrect, which automatically fixed certain typing errors, and AutoFormat, which could <b>reformat</b> many parts of a document at once. While the Windows version received favorable reviews (e.g., from InfoWorld), the Mac OS version was widely derided. Many accused it of being slow, clumsy and memory intensive, and its user interface differed significantly from Word 5.1. In response to user requests, Microsoft offered Word 5 again, after it had been discontinued. Subsequent versions of Word for macOS are no longer direct ports of Word for Windows, instead featuring a mixture of ported code and native code.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{reproducibility}} of a standardized image for personal identification (SIPI), used in the comparative analysis of paranasal sinuses, and test the effect of inaccurate reformation of the SIPI on suitability for comparative identification. Five raters with different professional backgrounds independently <b>reformatted</b> SIPIs from ten post-mortem head CTs. Inter-rater, intra-rater agreement as well angular deviations between <b>reformatted</b> SIPI images and reference SIPI images were calculated. Second, raters assessed the suitability of 70 accurately and inaccurately <b>reformatted</b> SIPIs for identification with a 4 -point Likert scale. Inter-rater agreement as well as levels of significance regarding image suitability were calculated. Inter-rater agreement regarding reproducibility of SIPI reformation was excellent (inter-rater correlation coefficient (ICC) 0. 9995, intra-rater ICC 0. 9983). Deviation between the angular dimensions of the <b>reformatted</b> SIPIs and the reference SIPIs was ≤ 1 ° in 94 % of all 300 measurements. Inter-rater agreement regarding the effect of inaccurate SIPI reformation on suitability for comparative identification was fair (ICC 0. 6809). There was no statistically significant difference between raters' evaluation of image suitability (p= 0. 9755). This study shows that the standardized image for personal identification can be accurately <b>reformatted</b> by different raters with varying professional backgrounds. In addition, raters agree that inaccurately <b>reformatted</b> SIPIs are still suitable for comparative identification in the majority of cases...|$|R

In response, Drew Curtis noted the following reasons for the redesign: [...] "Websites have to evolve over time. Otherwise {{you end up with}} a layout anachronism like the Drudge Report. The old design was put into place years ago, over time changes were nailed on to the design like loose shingles on a leaky roof. It was time to <b>reformat</b> and remove a bunch of the clutter while trying to keep the core design intact."
