50|$|The phrase {{does not}} {{necessarily}} connote a fallacy. For example, a patient presents with <b>retrosternal</b> pain which is not relieved by sublingual nitrates (a standard remedy for angina pectoris) but is relieved with antacids (a standard remedy for heartburn).

50|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is caused}} mainly by {{the content of}} strongly acidic hydrochloric acid, but also due to thermal effects of reaction of zinc chloride with water. These effects cause lesions of the mucous membranes of the upper airways. Damage of the lower airways can manifest itself later as well, due to fine particles of zinc chloride and traces of phosgene. In high concentrations the smoke can be very dangerous when inhaled. Symptoms include dyspnea, <b>retrosternal</b> pain, hoarseness, stridor, lachrymation, cough, expectoration, {{and in some cases}} haemoptysis. Delayed pulmonary edema, cyanosis or bronchopneumonia may develop. The smoke and the spent canisters contain suspected carcinogens.|$|E

50|$|A chest X-ray and {{complete}} blood count {{may be useful to}} exclude other conditions at the time of diagnosis. Characteristic signs on X-ray are overexpanded lungs, a flattened diaphragm, increased <b>retrosternal</b> airspace, and bullae while it can help exclude other lung diseases, such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema or a pneumothorax. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the chest may show the distribution of emphysema throughout the lungs and can also be useful to exclude other lung diseases. Unless surgery is planned, however, this rarely affects management. An analysis of arterial blood is used to determine the need for oxygen; this is recommended in those with an FEV1 less than 35% predicted, those with a peripheral oxygen saturation of less than 92% and those with symptoms of congestive heart failure. In areas of the world where alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is common, people with COPD (particularly those below the age of 45 and with emphysema affecting the lower parts of the lungs) should be considered for testing.|$|E
5000|$|Ebola {{virus is}} one of the four ebolaviruses known to cause disease in humans. It has the highest case-fatality rate of these ebolaviruses, {{averaging}} 83 percent since the first outbreaks in 1976, although fatality rates up to 90 percent have been recorded in one outbreak (2002-03). There have also been more outbreaks of Ebola virus than of any other ebolavirus. The first outbreak occurred on 26 August 1976 in Yambuku. The first recorded case was Mabalo Lokela, a 44‑year-old schoolteacher. The symptoms resembled malaria, and subsequent patients received quinine. Transmission has been attributed to reuse of unsterilized needles and close personal contact, body fluids and places where the person has touched.During the 1976 Ebola outbreak in Zaire, Ngoy Mushola travelled from Bumba to Yambuku, where he recorded the first clinical description of the disease in his daily log: [...] "The illness is characterized with a high temperature of about 39°C, hematemesis, diarrhea with blood, <b>retrosternal</b> abdominal pain, prostration with [...] "heavy" [...] articulations, and rapid evolution death after a mean of three days."Since the first recorded clinical description of the disease during 1976 in Zaire, the recent Ebola outbreak that started in March 2014, in addition, has reached epidemic proportions and has killed more than 8000 people as of January 2015. This outbreak has been centered in West Africa, an area that had not previously been affected by the disease. The toll has been particularly grave in three countries: Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. A few cases have also been reported in countries outside of West Africa, all related to international travelers who were exposed in the most affected regions and later showed symptoms of Ebola fever after reaching their destinations.|$|E
30|$|A <b>retrosternal</b> hernia is {{one type}} of {{internal}} hernia defined as herniation of the intestine into the thoracic cavity by the <b>retrosternal</b> route. <b>Retrosternal</b> hernias may be categorized into two types: localized and extended. Localized hernias are located only in the <b>retrosternal</b> space. In contrast, extended hernias have spread {{not only to the}} <b>retrosternal</b> space but also to the thoracic cavity.|$|E
30|$|To {{prevent a}} <b>retrosternal</b> hernia after MIE, close {{attention}} {{must be paid}} to the procedure by which the <b>retrosternal</b> route is established. Uemura et al. [4] concluded that the use of a video-assisted maneuver might prevent injury to the parietal pleura during blunt dissection of the <b>retrosternal</b> space. Based on our cases, the <b>retrosternal</b> orifice should not be opened widely. The <b>retrosternal</b> orifice should be of adequate size for the gastric conduit and omentum with respect to both vascularity and hernia formation. A small amount of the omentum and a large orifice will lead to a <b>retrosternal</b> hernia. The pleura should not be injured without dissection of the surrounding tissue, and the intra-abdominal pressure must be controlled.|$|E
30|$|In summary, we {{experienced}} three cases of a <b>retrosternal</b> hernia as a rare complication after MIE. Surgeons {{should be aware}} of this uncommon complication if <b>retrosternal</b> route reconstruction is used after MIE. As MIE is performed more frequently in the near future, <b>retrosternal</b> hernia may become an increasingly more common complication.|$|E
40|$|In 24 {{patients}} {{where the}} lower border of a cervical goitre was poorly defined, {{the value of}} simple lung function tests in the prediction {{of the presence of}} a <b>retrosternal</b> goitre was assessed. At operation there were nine patients with <b>retrosternal</b> extension (Group I) and 15 without (Group II). The preoperative PEF ratio (observed to predicted) was significantly different between the two groups (P = 0. 004) with a positive predictive value of 90 % for a <b>retrosternal</b> goitre. This difference was abolished after thyroidectomy. There was a significant improvement in PEF in patients with <b>retrosternal</b> goitres after thyroidectomy (P less than 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONAlthough most <b>retrosternal</b> goitres can {{be removed}} through a {{standard}} collar incision, some cases require extra-cervical incisions for complete resection. We report a new technique to remove large <b>retrosternal</b> goitres without extra-cervical incisions. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe present two cases in which a US Army-Navy (Parker-Langenback) retractor was used to deliver large <b>retrosternal</b> components into the cervical incisions. DISCUSSIONThis technique is useful {{in cases where the}} <b>retrosternal</b> component extends {{beyond the reach of the}} exploring finger and a well-developed plane can be developed between the gland and surrounding tissue. CONCLUSIONThe cervical leverage technique allows removal of a large <b>retrosternal</b> component through a cervical incision, thereby avoiding the attendant morbidity of a thoracotomy or median sternotomy. It should not be used if there is suspected neoplastic disease, dense adherence to or invasion of surrounding intra-thoracic structures...|$|E
30|$|In 2010, the {{standard}} operation for esophageal cancer in our institution was thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy (TLE) with three-field lymph node dissection using mediastinal route reconstruction and cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. After {{the development of}} HH, the reconstruction route was changed from the mediastinal to <b>retrosternal</b> route in 2014. The esophageal hiatus was completely closed with nonabsorbable sutures, and the <b>retrosternal</b> route was established using a laparoscopic technique. Unfortunately, we experienced three cases of <b>retrosternal</b> hernia.|$|E
30|$|Minimally {{invasive}} esophagectomy {{is considered}} a beneficial approach to esophageal cancer, although a hiatal hernia occurs more frequently in this approach than in open esophagectomy with reconstruction via the mediastinal route. Development of an internal hernia to the <b>retrosternal</b> space is not a recognized complication of reconstruction via the <b>retrosternal</b> route after esophagectomy. We herein report three cases {{of the development of}} an internal hernia to the <b>retrosternal</b> space after minimally invasive esophagectomy.|$|E
30|$|Although MIE is {{considered}} beneficial, hiatal hernia (HH) occurs {{more frequently in}} MIE with reconstruction via the mediastinal route. A systematic review comparing HH after MIE versus OE showed that HH occurred more frequently after MIE (4.5 %) than OE (1.0 %) [2]. The <b>retrosternal</b> route is one reconstruction route {{that may be used}} after esophagectomy. Intrathoracic herniation of reconstructed organs was reported by Takayama et al. [3] and Uemura et al. [4], but no reports have described the incarceration of intestinal tissues other than reconstructed organs in the <b>retrosternal</b> space and thoracic cavity. We herein report three cases of internal hernia to the <b>retrosternal</b> space (hereafter called <b>retrosternal</b> hernia) after MIE.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Retrosternal</b> goiter {{is defined}} as a thyroid mass of which more than 50 % is located below the {{thoracic}} inlet. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the <b>retrosternal</b> goiter surgically approach through a neck incision and analyze the surgical technique. Case presentation: The case reported by us used a single neck collar-shaped incision for huge <b>retrosternal</b> goiter with good outcome. The patient was surgically treated through a neck incision without the need for sternotomy or lateral thoracotomy. We did not observe definitive lesions in the inferior laryngeal nerve or definitive hypoparathyroidism. Conclusions: Patients with <b>retrosternal</b> goiter can be safely treated surgically through a single neck incision, which is less trauma and recovery quickly...|$|E
30|$|Thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy with {{cervical}} anastomosis by <b>retrosternal</b> route reconstruction {{was performed}} in all three cases. All patients were men {{ranging in age from}} 60 to 80 [*]years. Two patients had abdominal pain, and one had experienced syncope. All patients were diagnosed by computed tomography with an internal hernia to the <b>retrosternal</b> space and thoracic cavity (<b>retrosternal</b> hernia) without ischemic change to the incarcerated intestine. Two patients received medical therapy to relieve their intra-abdominal pressure, which allowed for a successful reduction of the intestine into the abdomen. Open laparotomy was performed to repair the hernia in the third patient. After reducing the intestine into the abdomen, reefing of the <b>retrosternal</b> orifice was performed, and the gastric conduit was anchored to the abdominal wall. No relapse occurred in three cases throughout follow-up.|$|E
30|$|The common {{risk factors}} for both types of <b>retrosternal</b> hernia {{are the same as}} those for HH: {{reduction}} of peritoneal adhesions, extensive dilation of the <b>retrosternal</b> orifice, excessive intra-abdominal pressure, early mobilization, and low BMI. One risk factor that differs is injury to the mediastinal pleura induced by negative pressure derived from the thoracic cavity. Uemura et al. [4] concluded that injury to the mediastinal pleura introduces the reconstructed organ to the thoracic cavity by the negative pressure of breathing. We used the gastric tube as the reconstructed organ in the three patients described in the present report, but the intestine was drawn into the thoracic cavity by the <b>retrosternal</b> route. This is the first report to describe the herniation of the intestine instead of the reconstructed organs into the <b>retrosternal</b> space and thoracic cavity.|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{choice of}} <b>retrosternal</b> or {{orthotopic}} route for reconstruction exists after three-phase esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis. Whether {{the route of}} reconstruction affects postoperative morbidity, mortality and recurrence patterns remains controversial. Study Design: Patients with cancer of the thoracic esophagus who underwent three-phase esophagectomy between 1990 and 1999 were studied. Postoperative outcome, recurrence patterns and survival were analyzed from a prospectively collected database. Results: Seventy-five patients underwent three-phase esophagectomy. There were 46 patients in the <b>retrosternal</b> group and 29 in the orthotopic group. The {{mean age of the}} <b>retrosternal</b> group was younger than the orthotopic group, 60 and 66 years, respectively (p = 0. 004). The <b>retrosternal</b> group also had more advanced disease; 24 % of patients had curative resection compared with 59 % in the orthotopic group (p = 0. 003). There {{was no significant difference in}} postoperative complications except that the <b>retrosternal</b> group had more blood loss, median 800 ml compared with 700 ml (p = 0. 04). Hospital mortality was 13 % in the <b>retrosternal</b> group and 3. 4 % in the orthotopic group (p = 0. 24). Multivariate analysis showed that age (odds ratio 1. 16, p = 0. 035) and pulmonary risk (odds ratio 10, p = 0. 01) were predictive of hospital mortality, but not the route of reconstruction. No patient in the <b>retrosternal</b> group developed recurrence in the gastric conduit compared to 4 of 28 patients (14 %) in the orthotopic group (p = 0. 03). Two of these patients were symptomatic with bleeding from the intragastric recurrence. Survival was worse in the <b>retrosternal</b> group, 5 -year survival was 29. 8 vs. 8. 2 % (p < 0. 01), reflecting the more advanced disease and higher prevalence of palliative resections. Conclusions: Cardiopulmonary complications and hospital mortality were not significantly different in the two groups. Recurrent tumor infiltration of the gastric conduit occurred in 14 % of patients when the orthotopic route was used. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
30|$|As for treatment, the <b>retrosternal</b> hernia is {{controversial}} [2, 6, 11, 12]. Based on our experience, two approaches can be considered. First, if CT reveals no ischemic {{change to the}} herniated contents, reduction {{and control of the}} intra-abdominal pressure might lead to a reduction of the herniated contents into the abdominal cavity. In case 3, despite the presence of an extended type hernia with negative pressure derived from the thoracic cavity, relief of the intra-abdominal pressure successfully reduced the herniated contents. Second, if the decrease in the intra-abdominal pressure is unsuccessful, surgical repair is needed. We chose open laparotomy instead of laparoscopy because we expected postoperative adhesions around the <b>retrosternal</b> orifice. We also performed reefing of the dilated <b>retrosternal</b> orifice and anchored the gastric conduit to the ventral wall. This procedure may be essential for preventing herniation after MIE. If this suturing technique is enough to prevent a <b>retrosternal</b> hernia, then laparoscopic repair is another treatment choice.|$|E
30|$|Hiatal hernia is a well-recognized {{complication}} after {{minimally invasive}} esophagectomy; however, <b>retrosternal</b> hernia {{is a rare}} complication following this procedure. Based on the present report, if no ischemic change {{is present in the}} herniated intestine, two types of potentially curative treatments are available: medical or surgical. As minimally invasive esophagectomy is performed more frequently, <b>retrosternal</b> hernia may become an increasingly more common complication in the near future.|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} for median sternotomy for <b>retrosternal</b> goiter {{is complex and}} proper consensus are lacking. Generally, {{it is based on}} clinical, radiological and intraoperative assessment. Among the few known features include primary mediastinal goiter, posterior mediastinal goiter and recurrent <b>retrosternal</b> goiter. We present a patient with posterior mediastinal, secondary goiter that extended until the tracheal bifurcation. The goiter was removed successfully via a low cervical incision and this was achieved by dissecting along the anatomical plane close to the thyroid capsule using blunt dissection with fingers. It is possible for these kinds of high risk <b>retrosternal</b> goitres to be safely removed without the need for thoracotomy when the surgery was performed along the proper plane...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the surgical approaches in <b>retrosternal</b> goiters. Materials and Methods: We reviewed 23 patients operated with the diagnosis of <b>retrosternal</b> goiter. Twelve (52 %) of the cases were female and 11 (48 %) were male. Mean age was 53. 8 ± 10. 9 years. Shortness of breath was seen in 12 (52 %) of the patients as the most frequent preoperative symptom. On the chest posteroanterior radiography, 18 (78 %) cases were found to have tracheal compression. CT images demonstrated <b>retrosternal</b> extension to the level of the aortic arch in all patients. All 23 patients were prepared for a thoracic approach. Results: Among 448 cases operated with the diagnosis of goiter, 23 patients (5. 1 %) had evidence of <b>retrosternal</b> goiter. Of those 23 patients, only 10 had deep <b>retrosternal</b> extension of the goiter that actually required a thoracic approach, which accounted for 2. 2 % of all thyroidectomies performed. Total median sternotomy in seven cases, partial sternotomy in two cases and right thoracotomy in one case were performed. Hypoparathyroidism was not detected postoperatively and no hospital mortality occurred. Conclusions: Goiters extending to the mediastinum can be excised successfully by cervical incision. Thoracic approach has an excellent outcome, achieving a safe resection and relieving all symptoms, especially in large or recurrent goiters extending to the mediastinum and with close relation to mediastinal structures...|$|E
