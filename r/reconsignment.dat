The latter perfume, with the fostering aid of boiling water and lemon-peel, diffused itself throughout the room, and became so highly concentrated around the warm fireside, that the wind passing over the house roof must have rushed off charged with a delicious whiff of it, after buzzing like a great bee at that particular chimneypot.|$|E

Chicago and Erie Railroad Company, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{involving}} a suit over demurrage of an Erie Railroad car used by Berwind-White Coal Mining Company to transport coal. The Court asserted that the filing of rates with the Interstate Commerce Commission complied with the notice requirements of the Act to Regulate Commerce and the point of <b>reconsignment</b> was clear under the company's usual practice for many years.|$|E

These facilities constructed with Lend-Lease funds contained single-story warehouses, 960 ft long and 180 ft wide, with platforms for loading and unloading railway tracks running the full length of each side and a platform for handling truck freight at one end. Nearby open storage areas were available for freight unloaded from railway cars with cranes. These 600-acre sites employed thousands of civilians and hundreds of Italian prisoners of war and included shops, roundhouses, a mess hall, fire station, dispensary, cafeteria, bachelor officers’ quarters and administration buildings. Fuels, explosives and refrigerated cargoes were handled elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The February 1950 tornado {{outbreak}} was {{a deadly}} tornado outbreak that devastated parts of Louisiana and Tennessee on February 11-13, 1950. The outbreak covered {{about a day}} and a half and produced numerous tornadoes, mostly from East Texas to the lower Mississippi Valley, with activity concentrated in Texas and Louisiana. Most of the deaths occurred in Louisiana and Tennessee, where tornadoes killed 28 and nine people, respectively. Several long-lived tornado families struck the Red River region of northwestern Louisiana, especially the Shreveport-Bossier City area. One of the tornadoes attained violent intensity, F4, on the Fujita scale and caused 18 deaths, including six at the Shreveport Holding and <b>Reconsignment</b> Depot near Barksdale Air Force Base. It remains one of the top ten deadliest tornadoes on record in the state of Louisiana, in eighth place.|$|E
40|$|Settlement patterns, urban function, {{and capital}} {{formation}} in medieval Flanders A study of primitive settlement patterns {{and the means}} of capital formation suggests that Henri Pirenne and his followers have greatly exaggerated the importance of industry and long distance trade in the functional origin of the cities of medieval Flanders. The cities developed initially as centers for the <b>reconsignment</b> of agricultural products. Capital thus formed was invested in industrial production, which meant considerable profits through export. But greater per capita profit could be made in provisioning the urban masses with necessary wool and grain than in textile manufacturing. The fundamental division of all urban populations into basic and non-basic factors of production thus explains in large measure {{the rise of the}} Flemish cities, together with the continued prosperity of the wealthiest families after Flemish urban textiles has lost some of their export market. The locally bound nature of the cities caused them to develop in Flanders, as elsewhere in a rough rank-size pattern, while the enormous size which foreign capital made possible for Ghent, Bruges, and Ypres enabled the great cities to exercise disproportionate political power, even as they transcended Flanders proper as an economic region.
