40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of developing a}} policy to make student health insurance manORtory, with <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>waiver,</b> was studied {{by a team of}} graduate students, and recommendations were presented for an advisory committee and the Arizona Board of Regents. Objectives included: clarifying issues concerning mandatory student health insurance, with particular attention to possible impacts at the universities; and surveying other academic institutions to assess their experience with student health insurance. A telephone survey of U. S. universities with undergraduate enrollment over 20, 000 and that offer graduate programs was conducted, and 27 of 31 universities responded. Universities with known mandatory programs were also contacted. Three major issues were identified: the substantial numbers of students without health care insurance; the importance of carefully marketing student health insurance; and the key players wh...|$|E
50|$|A non-variation clause does {{sometimes}} have unacceptable consequences, and its application is limited. It is restrictively interpreted, because it limits {{the principle of}} freedom of contract. Cancellation of the contract and certain forms <b>of</b> <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> (e.g. <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> an accrued <b>right</b> arising from a breach of contract, datio in solutum, release of the debtor, and a pactum de non petendo) do not amount to variations. A non-variation clause is not enforced where its enforcement is against public policy or where estoppel can be raised. Neither defence has successfully been raised on the facts in any reported case.|$|R

In 2011, TSC received an orphan drug designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration {{for the use of}} TSC as a radiosensitizer in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients. In accordance with standard practice, the Orphan Drug designation for TSC confers benefits including enhanced patent protection and marketing <b>rights,</b> <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> certain FDA filing fees and favorable tax treatment.

40|$|One of the {{consequences}} <b>of</b> <b>waiver</b> legislation is the long-term imprisonment of juveniles. Little is known about juveniles subject to long-term incarceration and the legal decision making that creates the conditions and length of their imprisonment. Although there is an emerging body {{of research on the}} front end <b>of</b> <b>waiver</b> that draws on theories of sentencing, there is little research on postsentencing decisions. Research on the back end <b>of</b> <b>waiver</b> is needed to understand the effect of transferring juveniles to criminal court. Legal decision making at the back end <b>of</b> <b>waiver</b> can be understood in terms of the jurisdictional context of organizational knowledge. The effects <b>of</b> back-end <b>waiver</b> decisions also need to be understood with respect to the reaction of juvenile offenders to their long-term incarceration...|$|R

40|$|Waiver {{plays a role}} in {{numerous}} areas of law, yet no one has attempted to provide a unifying theory <b>of</b> <b>waiver,</b> explaining why some rights cannot be waived and why courts and legislatures have set different standards for the validity <b>of</b> <b>waivers</b> in different circumstances. This article proposes that maximization of autonomy functions as an underlying goal of our legal system generally, and thus the concept of autonomy provides a basis for understanding waivers. It analyzes autonomy in some detail and offers an evaluative framework that functions both descriptively and normatively across different legal areas. There are two senses of autonomy at issue - one an ascriptive sense that refers to an inherent characteristic that cannot be waived, and the other a descriptive sense that can be waived. <b>Waivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> relating to descriptive autonomy depend on an analysis of the autonomy, specifically validity, <b>of</b> the <b>waiver.</b> The elements <b>of</b> a valid <b>waiver</b> are themselves drawn from the concept of autonomy. Moreover, there are system constraints that often function to limits waivers in particular circumstances. The final part of this article applies the framework to three examples, chosen because they represent current and important controversies: <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> informed consent to medical care, <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> Fourth Amendment <b>rights,</b> and contractual <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> statutory <b>rights...</b>|$|R

40|$|Waiver clauses, which {{purport to}} bar claims for reparations, appear in {{numerous}} {{historical and contemporary}} peace agreements, including in the 1951 Treaty of Peace with Japan. This Article questions the validity <b>of</b> many such <b>waivers</b> under the Constitution and applicable international law. However, as demonstrated {{in a series of}} federal court decisions from 2000 to 2003 which rejected the reparations claims of former forced laborers in wartime Japan, judges are induced by political considerations to uphold the validity <b>of</b> <b>waiver</b> clauses. How can courts reconcile their duty to protect the fundamental <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> claimants with the realpolitik considerations at play? One answer lies in adopting established interpretive approaches to limit the scope <b>of</b> a <b>waiver</b> clause. The waiver clause in the 1951 Treaty, like many of its counterparts in other treaties, contains several ambiguities. This Article outlines three rights-based interpretive approaches and demonstrates how these could have been invoked to construe one particularly ambiguous aspect <b>of</b> the <b>waiver</b> in the 1951 Treaty, in a manner which would have reconciled competing policy imperatives...|$|R
