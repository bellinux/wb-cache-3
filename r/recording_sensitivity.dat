METHODS: A random sample of residents within a purposive sample of care homes (nursing and residential) was selected. A clinical pharmacist inspected the GP medical record, the medicines administration record, and the care home record for each resident to identify drug sensitivities and discrepancies between records and to describe the nature of the <b>recorded</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> RESULTS: The <b>records</b> of 121 residents in 31 care homes were studied. Thirty-one (26 %) residents had at least one documented drug sensitivity in one of the sources inspected, with 48 <b>sensitivities</b> in total <b>recorded.</b> There was no description {{of the nature of the}} <b>sensitivities</b> <b>recorded</b> in 39 / 48 (81 %) cases.

40|$|Abstract Background In view of {{the issues}} {{surrounding}} physical restraint use, {{it is important to}} have a method of measurement as valid and reliable as possible. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of physical restraint use a) reported by nursing staff and b) reviewed from medical and nursing records in nursing home settings, by comparing these methods with direct observation. Methods We sampled eight care units in skilled nursing homes, seven care units in nursing homes and one long-term care unit in a hospital, from eight facilities which included 28 nurses and 377 residents. Physical restraint use was assessed the day following three periods of direct observation by two different means: interview with one or several members of the regular nursing staff, and review of medical and nursing <b>records.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> and specificity values were calculated according to 2 -by- 2 contingency tables. Differences between the methods were assessed using the phi coefficient. Other information collected included: demographic characteristics, disruptive behaviors, body alignment problems, cognitive and functional skills. Results Compared to direct observation (gold standard), reported restraint use by nursing staff yielded a sensitivity of 87. 4 % at a specificity of 93. 7 % (phi = 0. 84). When data was reviewed from subjects' medical and nursing <b>records,</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was reduced to 74. 8 %, and specificity to 86. 3 % (phi = 0. 54). Justifications for restraint use including risk for falls, agitation, body alignment problems and aggressiveness were associated with the use of physical restraints. Conclusions The interview of nursing staff and the review of medical and nursing records are both valid and reliable techniques for measuring physical restraint use among nursing home residents. Higher sensitivity and specificity values were achieved when nursing staff was interviewed as compared to reviewing medical records. This study suggests that the interview of nursing staff is a more reliable method of data collection. </p...|$|R
