Each chapter finishes with a summary of relevant legal principles, making the book unusually accessible. Since the publication of the third edition in 2007, a number of significant cases have been decided in the area of trusts: - In relation to apparently explicit declarations of trust, Byrnes v Kendle (2011) 243 CLR 253 has changed the law laid down in the earlier High Court decision of Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) v Jolliffe (1920) 28 CLR 178. The decision in Jolliffe had been unchallenged in more than 90 years. - In the area of the fiduciary’s accountability for bribes taken in breach of fiduciary duty, two recent decisions are included: Sinclair Investments (UK) Ltd v Versailles Trade Finance Ltd (in administrative receivership) [2011] 3 WLR 1153 and the contrary opinion of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Grimaldi v Chameleon Mining NL (No 2) [2012] FCAFC 6. - In the area of charitable trusts discussion of Aid/Watch Incorporated v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2010) 241 CLR 539 is included. - The impact of the Personal Property Security Act 2009 (Cth) on Romalpa clauses is also discussed...|$|R

500|$|Before Culverhouse's death, his wife, Joy, {{had signed}} a post-nuptial {{agreement}} to surrender her half of the estate. This was done {{on the advice of}} lawyer Fred F. Cone, Jr., who would later become one <b>of</b> the three <b>trustees</b> handling the Culverhouse estate. Joy charged that the trustees were mishandling the estate, and not paying her share. She filed a malpractice suit against Cone for advising her to give up her marital rights, and a second suit asking for accounting of the estate and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trustees.</b> She said that Hugh and Cone advised her to sign the agreement for tax reasons, and falsely claimed that Culverhouse was on the brink of bankruptcy. She charged that the three trustees, Cone, Jack Donlan, and Stephen F. Story, paid themselves $4.35 million in bonuses for arranging the Buccaneers' sale, sums far in excess of what Culverhouse himself had specified, and that they paid Story a sum that was comparable to the salary of a Fortune 500 executive for managing the estate and included a 10-year golden parachute clause. She also alleged that the value of Culverhouse's estate had been misrepresented to her at the time that she signed the agreement. The lawsuits made the details of the Culverhouse estate public. When it was discovered that the trust had paid hush money to a mistress of Hugh's, Joy's lawyer alleged that Hugh had planned to divorce Joy, and that the trust was created to deprive her of her rightful assets. Court depositions revealed three extramarital affairs, including Susan Brinkley, wife of broadcaster David Brinkley. The suits were eventually settled, with each <b>of</b> the three <b>trustees</b> being paid $3 million to remove themselves from the handling of his estate, and Joy being allowed to appoint her own trustees. Joy then said of Hugh, [...] "I'd like to pull him out of the grave and shoot him with every bullet I could get".|$|R
