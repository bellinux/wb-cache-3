5000|$|The Mazda R360 is a kei {{car that}} was {{produced}} by Mazda. It was Mazda's first real car - a two-door, four-seat coupé. Introduced in 1960, it featured a short 69 inch (1753 mm) wheelbase and weighed just 838 lb (380 kg). It was powered by a rear-mounted air-cooled 356 cc V-twin engine putting out about 16 hp (12 kW) and 16 lb·ft (22 Nm) of torque. The car was capable of about 52 mph (84 km/h). It had a 4-speed manual or two-speed automatic transmission. [...] The suspension, front and <b>rear,</b> was <b>rubber</b> [...] "springs" [...] and torsion bars.|$|R
50|$|In September 1977 the 450 SLC 5.0 {{joined the}} line. This was a {{homologation}} {{version of the}} big coupé, featuring a new all-aluminum five-liter V8, aluminum alloy bonnet and boot-lid, and a black <b>rubber</b> <b>rear</b> spoiler, along with a small front-lip spoiler. The 450SLC 5.0 was produced in order to homologate the SLC for the 1978 World Rally Championship.|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, the 80 Sport was {{introduced}} in the UK, based on the GTE. It came with quattro-style Ronal alloys, <b>rubber</b> <b>rear</b> spoiler, deep chin spoiler, striped charcoal Recaro interior, and optional body graphics including full-length [...] "Audi Sport" [...] stripes. A special commemorative-edition version, the Audi 4000CS quattro, was made for the 1985, 1986, and 1987 model years.|$|R
50|$|After the War FN built unit {{construction}} sv and ohv 249 cc, 344 cc, 444 cc, and 498 cc models, and two-stroke models from 49 cc singles, to 248 cc twins. The two-stroke models used German JLO engines. The semi-unit engined Tri-car was released for civilian commercial use as the Tri-car T-8, with a five-speed gearbox. In 1947 the M.XIII {{was available in}} 250 cc ohv, 350 cc ohv, 350 cc sv, 450 cc ohv, and 450 cc sv configurations. The first model used an unusual patented Swiss coil sprung girder front fork and a new <b>rubber</b> <b>rear</b> suspension.In 1948 the Swiss forks were replaced with an adaptation of the <b>rubber</b> <b>rear</b> suspension, which was itself replaced with an improved version. In 1951 the option of telescopic forks was introduced. In 1954 a swing arm frame was introduced. By 1958 the M.XIII toolbox {{was part of the}} fuel tank.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the {{subframe}} changed to an approximate triangle, bolted {{to the front of}} the differential and attached to the car at approximately the same points as the radius arms of the first generation IRS. The rear of the differential was further supported by a pair of link rods attaching it to the car's <b>rear</b> floor structure. <b>Rubber</b> bushes at the attachment points provided the necessary levels of NVH suppression.|$|R
5000|$|The Joggler shares many {{external}} similarities with {{a digital}} photo frame, consisting of a 7" [...] screen with black border, dark grey plastic <b>rear</b> shell, integral <b>rubber</b> foot and chromed stand. The stand inclines the screen of the Joggler towards the user, providing a better angle for use. Although a number of promotional images show an O2 logo on the lower portion of the screen border, no production units feature this.|$|R
5000|$|In 1936, Manville {{introduced}} a version that held eighteen rounds of 26.5mm bore shells. This design fired 26.5mm x 3.15 inch Short (26.5mm x 80mmR) flare, smoke, and riot gas shells. Explosive shells {{were not available}} and the cylinder walls are too thin for shot-shells. The weapon {{is similar to the}} earlier 12-gauge version, except the barrel was either 9.5 inch mm or 9.75 inch mm, and used hard <b>rubber</b> <b>rear</b> grips instead of wood.|$|R
50|$|The cars of 1992 to 1994 are curiosities: {{although}} {{efforts were}} obviously {{being made to}} renew the model range, there were numerous stylistic hangovers from the quad-lamped models. Thus, {{the last of the}} 1983-designed dashboards were seen in 1994 although a new dashboard had been seen on some model ranges since 1987. Similarly, although the CN1 restyling eliminated anachronisms such as a kink upwards at the C-pillar and a <b>rubber</b> <b>rear</b> spoiler, it was not applied consistently.|$|R
50|$|The Ro 80 {{remained}} largely unchanged over its ten year production. From September 1969 the rectangular headlights were replaced with twin halogen units, and air extractor vents {{appeared on the}} C-pillar behind the doors. In August 1970 a slightly reshaped plastic grill replaced the metal grill of the early cars, and a minimal facelift in May 1975 saw the final cars getting enlarged <b>rear</b> lights and <b>rubber</b> inserts in the bumpers which increased the car's overall length by 15 mm to 4795 mm.|$|R
50|$|After {{a number}} of issues had been discovered, {{including}} a serious problem with rusting gas tubes, the existing stocks of the rifle were modified between 1953 and 1956, and the reworked rifles were designated Ag m/42B. Modifications included a stainless steel gas tube, two knobs on the breech cover, a new elevation knob for the <b>rear</b> sight, a <b>rubber</b> case-deflector, new magazines and new cleaning rod. The Ag m/42B was replaced in Swedish service in the mid 1960s by the Ak 4 (derived from the Heckler & Koch G3).|$|R
50|$|Life {{cycles of}} Lorryia formosa are {{characterized}} by six distinct developmental stages: egg, larva, protonymph, deutonymph, tritonymph, and adult. The average lifetime is 37 days, of which 60% is considered adulthood. The females of the species use an asexual form of reproduction where the growth and development of embryos occurs without fertilization by a male; this type of parthenogenesis, where females are produced from unfertilized eggs, is called thelytoky. It is not known whether the intracellular endosymbiont bacterium Wolbachia {{is responsible for the}} alteration in reproductive capability. Wolbachia, a genus of inherited bacteria common in insects, are known to alter the sex ratio in arthropods and mites. The sex ratio is also greatly influenced by the host plant: one study found that on citrus, 30% of the population were males, compared to 62% males when reared on grapefruit. <b>Reared</b> on <b>rubber</b> trees, the percentage of males in the population drops to very low, or nothing.|$|R
5000|$|Darts {{were offered}} to the taxicab {{industry}} for their whole production run from 1963 to 1976. While specifications varied by year, interior upgrades generally included heavy-duty front and <b>rear</b> black <b>rubber</b> floor mats, heavy-duty seat cushion springs with full foam back and air-foam seats, black all-vinyl trim with heavy canvas-backed vinyl seat covers, interior door pull assist straps or handles, and a door-ajar warning light for the driver. Mechanically, Dart taxicabs were generally equipped with heavy-duty brakes, tires, shock absorbers, front torsion bars and rear leaf springs, a high-output alternator, an increased-capacity cooling system and extra-lean carburetor calibration for greater economy. In 1976, the Chrome Yellow taxi package was available only with a 225 slant-six engine producing [...] and 170 lbft Nm; transmission was the (rare) A-727-RG (raised-deck motor, which was the slant-six series) with California emissions, [...] and 165 lbft Nm. Options included a radio suppression package and a Fuel Pacer System. Many—if not all—of them had a body color paint sales code of [...] "999", meaning special order paint ...|$|R
50|$|The 160Z colour {{scheme was}} based on the Datsun 280Z Zap car and came out in canary yellow with red, orange and yellow inlayed black decals, colour matched high back seats and Mexican stripe-cloth {{stitched}} in the centre panels. The 160Z also had front and rear spoilers; however, the front spoiler differed from the 140Z. Earlier models included a black <b>rubber</b> <b>rear</b> spoiler, whilst others had a colour matched yellow fibreglass rear spoiler - there is speculation as to whether Datsun-Nissan South Africa could no longer procure rubber spoilers or whether they felt the fibreglass spoiler was lighter and more durable than the rubber one.|$|R
2500|$|The Quadrifoglio Verde (Green Fourleaf Clover) {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1986, with many aesthetic tweaks, including sideskirts, mirrors, new front and <b>rear</b> spoilers, hard <b>rubber</b> trunk mounted spoilers with integral 3rd stoplight, unique 15" [...] alloys and optional removable hardtop. Different interior trim included blood red carpets and gray leather seats with red stitching. QV was offered in only 3 colours: red, silver and black. It was otherwise mechanically identical to the standard Spider Veloce model, with a 1962cc double overhead cam, four-cylinder engine (twin two-barrel carburetors in Europe; North American models retained the Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection introduced for the 1982 model year except that the VVT mechanism was now L-Jet activated) and five-speed manual transmission.|$|R
2500|$|Again in 1956 {{the top of}} {{the line}} Oldsmobile 98 series had an {{exclusive}} [...] wheelbase, [...] longer than the 88. Power came from the 240 horsepower Rocket V8 shared with the Super 88. Standard equipment included armrests, bumper guards, lined trunk, rotary door latches, dual horns, cigarette lighter, turn signals, rubber floor mats, aluminum door sill plates, sun visors, front and <b>rear</b> carpeting, foam <b>rubber</b> seat cushions, courtesy lights, front fender medallions, deck lid '98' script, back-up light moldings, electric clock, Jetaway Hydramatic Drive, padded dash, power steering, windshield washers and Deluxe steering wheel. Upholstery choices were pattern cloth and leather in a variety of colors and combinations. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] made by either U.S. Royal, Goodrich, or Firestone. The parking brake was now a foot pedal.|$|R
5000|$|After a {{successful}} sales run of both naturally aspirated and turbo models in 1980, Porsche unexpectedly released the 924 Carrera GT, making clear {{their intention to}} enter the 924 in competition. By adding an intercooler, increasing compression to 8.5:1 as well as various other little changes, Porsche was able to develop the 924 Turbo into the race car they had wanted, dubbing it the [...] "924 Carrera GT".Visually it differed to the 931 in that it had polyurethane plastic front and rear flared guards, a polyurethane plastic front spoiler, a top mounted air scoop for the intercooler, a much larger <b>rubber</b> <b>rear</b> spoiler and a flush mounted front windscreen. It lost the 931's NACA duct in the hood but retained the air intakes in the badge panel. This more aggressive styling was later used for as motivation for the 944.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} the GM Diesel 6-71 (426 cubic inches, 220 {{horsepower}} @ 2000 r.p.m.). Mounted transversely at the <b>rear</b> with three <b>rubber</b> mounts, it connected via angle {{drive to the}} rear axle through a 4-speed transmission. During the testing time, Greyhound added a two-speed clutch which {{became part of the}} original PD-4501 in 1954. The diesel also drove the hydraulic fluid pump, the alternator and a cooling fan. The hydraulic system operated the steering gear, but unlike the 4501 to come, it also worked the brakes and the six [...] windshield wipers. The seven gallons of fluid were pumped at a rate of 11 gallons per minute and generated a maximum pressure of 1500 PSI, with 900 PSI the norm. The muffler was mounted behind the rear bumper and the radiator was on the left rear side.|$|R
5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the wheels {{on one side}} of the robot rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of the robot was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the solid <b>rubber</b> <b>rear</b> wheels used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used custom-made aluminium drive wheels which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These wheels were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of oversteer in the drive system was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber front wheels were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked protrusions.|$|R
5000|$|Late in the model's life Lancia {{released}} the Trevi VX, with a Roots-type supercharger fitted between the carburettor and low-compression two-litre engine; the Coupé VX and HPE VX followed soon after (June 1983). These three variants {{were known as}} Volumex models and had the highest performance of all the road-going production Betas, with [...] and substantially increased torque over the normal two-litre 200 Nm. The Coupé VX and HPE VX can be distinguished from the normal cars by the offset bulge on the hood which is required to clear the new air intake, a spoiler fitted below the front bumper and the <b>rubber</b> <b>rear</b> spoiler. They also have stiffer spring rates. Lancia produced 1272 Coupé VX, 2370 HPE VX and 3900 Trevi VX. Most were left-hand drive (only 186 right-hand drive HPEs and around 150 RHD Coupés were imported to the UK, however the car was also sold in some other RHD markets so exact RHD production remains unknown). Only one right-hand drive Trevi VX was made.|$|R
5000|$|Issigonis {{went into}} the motor {{industry}} as an engineer and designer working for Humber and competed successfully in motor racing during the 1930s and 1940s. Starting around 1930, he raced a supercharged [...] "Ulster" [...] Austin Seven, later fitting it with a front axle of his own design, leading to employment at Austin. This greatly modified machine was replaced with a radical special completed in 1939, constructed of plywood laminated in aluminium sheeting. The suspension was also of advanced design, with trailing arm front suspension attached to a steel cross-member, and swing axle <b>rear,</b> all with <b>rubber</b> springs made of catapult elastic. This car was remarkably light, weighing 587 lb, of which the engine contributed 252 lb. By the time the chassis had been completed (hard labour—it was all done by hand, no power tools), Issigonis had moved to Morris Motors Limited, but Austin supplied a [...] "works" [...] specification supercharged side-valve engine. Issigonis usually won, even when entered in the 1100cc class {{if there was no}} 750cc category. Most events entered were sprints, but he also raced at circuits.|$|R
50|$|On lap 186, Kurt Busch {{nudged the}} turn two wall with his right-rear side and spun on the backstretch, {{triggering}} the seventh caution. He regained {{control of his}} car to run in ninth place. Most of the leaders made pit stops. Johnson led at the lap-190 restart, followed by Vickers and Kenseth. Johnson held a one-second lead over Vickers by the 200th lap, by which time Edwards had moved in front of Stewart. Vickers retook the lead from Johnson on lap 206. Fifteen laps later, the eighth caution was triggered when Edwards's car suffered a cut right-rear tire, slowed on the track and spun at turn four while driving cautiously to the pit road. Edwards collected his teammate, Ragan, who was run into by Elliott. Mears was close by the incident but avoided damaging his car. On lap 222, Vickers reported a power steering problem, and Kyle Busch was losing battery power. Most of the leaders, including Vickers, made pit stops. Kyle Busch's car had a replacement battery fitted and Vickers topped up with more fluids; both drivers rejoined in twelfth and thirteenth positions. Johnson led at the lap-227 restart, with Kenseth in second place. One lap later, Kenseth passed Johnson to take over first place, while Kyle Busch made heavy contact with the wall on his right side; a caution was not needed. Johnson reclaimed the first position from Kenseth on the backstretch on the 245th lap. Kyle Busch's right-front tire was cut, {{and went into the}} turn four wall on lap 252, triggering the ninth caution. During the caution, most of the leaders, including Johnson, chose to make pit stops. Johnson made changes to his car's left and right <b>rear</b> spring <b>rubber,</b> and Stewart's car's air pressure was adjusted.|$|R
50|$|René Arnoux put his Renault on pole {{position}} but the slow {{start of the}} turbocharged car allowed Alan Jones to break free. Arnoux and Clay Regazzoni collided, eliminating the Williams on the spot while the poleman only lasted {{to the end of}} the lap as he limped back to the pits. Jody Scheckter fell to last place on the first lap and began the task of working through the field. Gilles Villeneuve, who made it through the first lap ahead of Jean-Pierre Jabouille, passed Jones at Tarzan on lap 11. He gave the lead back to Jones when he spun on lap 47. On lap 51, just after passing the pits, Villeneuve's left rear tyre exploded causing him to spin. He regained control to begin one of the wildest laps in history. He drove an entire lap on two tyres, the right front was in the air and the left <b>rear</b> was shredding <b>rubber</b> and sparking with the pavement. Reaction was mixed. It was either an act of the ultimate competitor not wanting to give up or an irresponsible, emotional decision. Either way he was out as his suspension was too damaged to rejoin the race. Jones finished first giving him his third consecutive and Williams their fourth consecutive victory. However, Scheckter worked his way up to finish second and due to Jones' poor performance in the first half of the season, the Ferrari driver only needed 4 more points to ensure a Ferrari would win the driver's title.|$|R
5000|$|Encouraged by this success, Bert Greeves {{decided to}} diversify into {{motorcycle}} manufacture. A keen trials rider {{in his spare}} time, he had started collecting veteran and vintage motorcycles, including a 1912 Triumph with the registration 'OLD 1'. His disabled cousin Derry Preston-Cobb also encouraged him to start the motorcycle business. Derry's own Invacar {{was used as a}} promotional vehicle and had been fitted with a more powerful engine, which he used to amazed other drivers as he overtook them on the Southend roads. [...] Working together they developed a prototype using a two-stroke [...] single-cylinder engine sourced from Villiers Engineering - and a Greeves badge on the fuel tank. The motorcycles were really a sideline for the main business of producing the three-wheeled invalid cars, so development of the prototypes had to be fitted in when the production schedule allowed. Bert had been an enthusiastic motorcyclist in his youth and always had an ambition to become a motorcycle manufacturer. The first Greeves motorcycle was developed in mid-1951, using rubber-in-torsion springing at both front and <b>rear.</b> This unconventional <b>rubber</b> springing came straight from the patented system used for the invalid car. Rear wheel suspension was by a pivoted fork with rods connecting to torsion rubber mounted units just below the seat. Friction dampers were also fitted which could be manually adjusted. [...] The front forks were also unusual, with short leading links to carry the wheel, pivoting on rubber-in-torsion spring units (later known as the 'Banana Leading Link' front fork. Motorcycle production began in the autumn of 1953 and the new models featured a unique frame with the steering head and a massive front down member combined in a large 'I-section' cast alloy beam, cast in a new light-alloy foundry that had been added to the Greeves factory. The tubular frame member was inserted into a mould and the main frame was cast around it, making for a very strong frame. Made from LM6 silicon-aluminium alloy, it was claimed to be stronger than tubular steel and proved capable of standing up to the rough treatment of international off road trials competition. Protection was finished off with reinforced engine cradle plates which were also light alloy castings.|$|R
40|$|Rearing {{substrate}} is {{an important}} component of the pre-weaning environment of dairy calves. Traditional substrate types, such as sawdust, are becoming difficult and/or expensive for farmers to obtain in New Zealand. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate alternative rearing substrates for dairy calves that that are economically viable for farmers, readily available and provide an acceptable level of animal welfare. The preference of dairy calves for four different rearing substrates and the effects on behaviour and physiology were evaluated. At 1 wk of age, 24 calves were housed in groups of four, in pens which were evenly divided into four <b>rearing</b> substrates: sawdust, <b>rubber,</b> sand and stones. During the first 3 d calves were given free access to all four substrates. Calves were then restricted to each substrate type for 48 h. In order to rank preference, calves were subsequently exposed to two surfaces simultaneously for 48 h until calves experienced all six treatment combinations. Finally, calves were given free access to all four substrates simultaneously for 48 h. Lying behaviour and location in the pen was recorded for 24 h at the end of each experimental period using handycams and accelerometers. Preference was determined based on lying times on each substrate. The insulating properties of each substrate were assessed using iButtons®. During the initial free choice period, the proportion of time spent standing (p . 05) of rearing substrate on concentrations of cortisol, lactate, glucose, or white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte count or the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. The insulating properties were greatest for sawdust and lowest for sand. During the pairwise choice period, calves had a strong preference for one substrate over another, spending on average, 89 % of their time on the preferred surface. Calves preference ranking was for sawdust, rubber, sand then stones as determined by the proportion of time spent on each surface. At the end of the study, when given free access to all rearing substrates again, calves spent a higher proportion of time on sawdust (85 %) than all other substrates (rubber: 5 %, sand: 7 % and stones: 3 %). In conclusion, dairy calves showed a clear preference for sawdust over rubber, sand and stones. This preference remained consistent over the course of the study. The calves’ preference for sawdust may be associated with the physical and thermal properties in comparison to the alternative substrates. However, factors such as cost to the farmer, availability and practicality of alternative substrates need to be considered along with animal preferences before any recommendations can be made...|$|R
