5000|$|The <b>religious</b> <b>ambiance</b> gives House of Night {{a strong}} moral {{perspective}} {{as it is}} often enforced that Nyx gives vampyres and humans free will. [...] This theme takes special prominence in Tempted, where Zoey discovers that, although she is the reincarnation of a woman created to love Kalona, she {{has the power to}} choose whether she will follow her previous incarnations path or reject it. One of the characters dies because Zoey makes the wrong choice. Also, in Burned, a Manichaen view of the Universe is presented, in which Good battles Evil: forces of Light combat forces of Darkness and characters must choose which side to be on. Also, the black and white bull are presented. In Awakened, the theme of love is presented, in which love must battle Darkness, and life is really only, always, about love.|$|E
5000|$|The first floor, called The Chamber of Dharma Waters (法水院, Hou-sui-in), is {{rendered}} in shinden-zukuri style, {{reminiscent of the}} residential style of the 11th century Heian imperial aristocracy. It is evocative of the Shinden palace style. It is designed as an open space with adjacent verandas and uses natural, unpainted wood and white plaster. This helps to emphasize the surrounding landscape. The walls and fenestration also affect the views from inside the pavilion. Most of the walls are made of shutters that can vary the amount of light and air into the pavilion and change the view by controlling the shutters' heights. The second floor, called The Tower of Sound Waves (潮音洞, Chou-on-dou [...] ), is built {{in the style of}} warrior aristocrats, or buke-zukuri. On this floor, sliding wood doors and latticed windows create a feeling of impermanence. The second floor also contains a Buddha Hall and a shrine dedicated to the goddess of mercy, Kannon. The third floor is built in traditional Chinese chán (Jpn. zen) style, also known as zenshū-butsuden-zukuri. It is called the Cupola of the Ultimate (究竟頂, Kukkyou-chou). The zen typology depicts a more <b>religious</b> <b>ambiance</b> in the pavilion, as was popular during the Muromachi period.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{demonstrates how}} the Weltanschauung found in Álvaro Mutis´s oeuvre is profoundly {{influenced by a}} late romantic conscience found in the Latin American posvanguardia generation (1920 – 1940). Melancholy –as late modern affective condition- and fading of the subject –as narrative and aesthetic imaginary- are two central figures in his fictional universe. As a consequence of this, some of the heroes and topics in Mutis’s oeuvre are in dialogue with the main topics of the first literary movement in Hispanic America, Modernism. Some of them are: a <b>religious</b> <b>ambiance</b> in their prose, hedonism, cosmopolitanism, decadentism, Latin American landscape as entropy and a fractured self. There is a narrative logic in the literary corpus analyzed –which one can extend to Mutis’ s oeuvre. The hero, before starting his adventure, begins a psychological phenomenology called “fading of the subject”, which is a symbolic process that affects not only his stability as a hero but also the enterprise to which he is committed; all this thanks to his “melancholic condition”. This emotional process begins by revealing poetic images of internal destruction, amalgamation and death, which the hero transfers to the external world. In some of the texts analyzed this process concludes by producing death and devastation (El Húsar, La muerte del estratega), in others there is an urgent need to a symbolic resignification (Amirbar) that allows the hero to survive and start a new adventure. This “spiritual condition” is something Maqroll - Mutis’ main character- knows well when someone asks him about his precarious physical condition, “The tropical fevers [...] . I have them already!” (Amirbar 491...|$|E
