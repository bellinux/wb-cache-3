Darryl blames himself for the failure and demands that Andy fire him, leaving Andy baffled and with no choice but to handle the hiring of new warehouse staff himself.|$|E

However, the name of Jefferson Davis Highway itself, a portion of U.S. 1 that only the Virginia General Assembly could rename, remained unchanged.|$|E

5|$|Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond said that, {{during the}} time of {{shooting}} for the film, Spielberg got more ideas by watching movies every night which in turn extended the production schedule because he was continually adding new scenes to be filmed. Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on Jaws. In her 1991 book You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a cocaine addiction. Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a perfectionist.|$|E
5|$|Following popular {{television}} {{appearances and}} concerts during their February 1964 visit, the Beatles {{returned to the}} United States in August 1964, and again in August 1965, for tours. In August 1966 they returned once more, and although this tour was commercially successful, it coincided with a storm of U.S. public protest after publication of a quote from John Lennon's <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> Christianity. The 1966 U.S. tour {{marked the end of}} the Beatles' concert days. The band ceased to perform commercial concerts, instead devoting their efforts to creating new material in the recording studio.|$|E

Seeking to benefit from being nearest to the president, Chandler sat between Roosevelt and Barkley {{in the back seat}} of the open-topped vehicle that transported them to Latonia Race Track, the site of Roosevelt's first speech. Throughout his tour of the state, Roosevelt endorsed Barkley while remaining friendly with Chandler; after Roosevelt's departure, Chandler played up Roosevelt's complimentary <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> him while downplaying or ignoring critical remarks.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers made {{positive}} <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> the game's orchestral {{score and}} voice acting. Kasavin (GameSpot) wrote that added choral tracks during intense in-game moments gave the game epic overtones, though Clayman (IGN) thought the score made the game environments feel delusively majestic. Bramwell (Eurogamer) found little {{joy in the}} verbose dialogue, which he often skipped even during important scenes, but Kasavin (GameSpot) considered the voice acting amusing, with good quality. He also praised the level of nuance in the sound effects, such as those made as characters walked.|$|E
5|$|While {{this was}} not yet {{the end of the}} media’s freedom after the Prague Spring, it was the {{beginning}} of the end. During November, the Presidium, under Husak, declared that the Czechoslovak press could not make any negative <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> the Soviet invaders or they would risk violating the agreement they had come to at the end of August. When the weeklies Reporter and Politika responded harshly to this threat, even going so far as to not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in Politika, the government banned Reporter for a month, suspended Politika indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television.|$|E

5|$|Following Armageddon, Orton {{entered the}} 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, {{but he was}} {{eliminated}} by Rey Mysterio. Mysterio won the match and a title shot, and Orton urged him to put the title shot at stake in a match at No Way Out. In the weeks preceding No Way Out, Orton made controversial <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio's friend who had died a few months previously, {{in an attempt to}} gain villain heat. Many fans felt the comments were highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero's death in November 2005. Orton won at No Way Out, earning Mysterio's title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, however, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio, and then-champion, Kurt Angle. On April 2, at WrestleMania 22, Orton was pinned by Mysterio, making Mysterio the World Heavyweight Champion and ending their on-screen rivalry.|$|E
5|$|Forster wrote well-polished German prose, {{which was}} not only scientifically {{accurate}} and objective, but also exciting and easy to read. This differed from conventional travel literature of the time, insofar as it presented {{more than a mere}} collection of data – it also demonstrated coherent, colourful and reliable ethnographical facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation. He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> his observations. His main focus was always on the people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In A Voyage Round the World he even presented the songs sung by the people of Polynesia, complete with lyrics and notation. The book {{is one of the most}} important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.|$|E
5|$|Grassi's {{arguments}} and conclusions were criticised {{in a subsequent}} article, Discourse on Comets, published {{under the name of}} one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself. Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christopher Scheiner, and various uncomplimentary <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work. The Jesuits were offended, and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own, The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance, under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano, purporting to be one of his own pupils.|$|E

5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the Pawnee parks {{department}} {{prepares for}} a visit by park department officials from Boraqua, Pawnee's Sister City in Venezuela. Leslie warns her co-workers the Venezuelan government officials will likely be poor, simple people. Later, the Venezuelan delegation arrives, headed by their parks department vice director Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Morana, the Vice-director Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departmento de Parques, L.G.V. (Fred Armisen), Antonio, Jhonny and Elvis. There are cultural clashes right away, like when they mistake Tom (Aziz Ansari) for a servant and order him to get their bags. They also mistakenly believe they can choose any woman to have sex with; they all favor Donna (Retta). Raul and Leslie exchange gifts during a meet-and-greet party, where Raul and the Venezuelans act condescending toward the Pawnee residents, making offensive <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> the town and mocking the gifts Leslie gives them. They continue to give orders to Tom, who follows along because they give him large cash tips.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a mysteriously ill Jordan {{continues}} {{to ask about}} Helen's whereabouts, and her <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> Helen's conditions lead Black to believe she is starting to experience the seemingly-psychic visions {{he is capable of}} seeing, which allow him to see the evil people are capable of. Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be found—although another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it is at this point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{physicist}} Leó Szilárd, who {{was living}} in the United States at the time, realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that could yield vast amounts of energy for electric power generation or atomic bombs. Such a reaction using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933, upon reading Ernest Rutherford's disparaging <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium. However, Szilárd {{had not been able to}} achieve a neutron-driven chain reaction with neutron-rich light atoms. In theory, if in a neutron-driven chain reaction the number of secondary neutrons produced was greater than one, then each such reaction could trigger multiple additional reactions, producing an exponentially increasing number of reactions.|$|E

5|$|At {{the house}} of Will's friends Max and Bella, Anna fits in {{perfectly}} as they all share stories. Honey immediately recognizes Anna and declares them best friends instantly. She and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 2006, Biman {{operated}} {{flights to}} John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, from Dhaka via Brussels. New York was Biman's farthest and most prestigious destination, and was kept operational despite heavy financial losses {{to maintain a}} landing slot in the US which, if cancelled, could be difficult to regain. To curb the losses, Biman reduced the service to one flight per week and re-routed it through Manchester Airport, UK, capitalising on travel demands from the expatriate Bangladeshi community {{in the north of}} England. On 8 April 2006, Biman's inaugural flight to Manchester landed at Manchester Airport en route to JFK. However, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had placed the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) into Category 2 (does not meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards) according to its International Aviation Safety Assessment Program, which placed additional restrictions on the country's airlines when flying to the US. A former CAAB assistant director made scathing <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> the CAAB in an opinion article in the Aviatour, a monthly travel and tourism supplement of Bangladeshi news magazine Weekly Holiday. For Biman, this meant that it could continue flying to the US, but could not expand or make alterations to its routes, such as changing the transit from Brussels to Manchester. The FAA fined Biman for breaching its rules, and flights to New York were again re-routed through Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Liz {{attempts}} to make amends by talking to Tracy during a rehearsal, during which she makes negative <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> Jenna {{and the other members}} of her staff. Liz is notified by Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) that her chat with Tracy was aired over the studio's monitors, which meant that everyone heard and saw her making the comments. Liz's staff show their displeasure by throwing food and other objects at her. Liz and Tracy discuss an idea to get everyone together to try and smooth things over, and Tracy decides to invite Liz and the staff to a party aboard a yacht. Tracy gets along well with everyone at the party, including Jenna, and things appear to be going very well. Liz soon discovers that the yacht does not belong to Tracy, and the yacht's real owner shows up with the NYPD. The following day Liz learns that Jack paid the newspapers to keep Tracy out of the press but left a photo of Jenna passing out on the yacht in their pages, which Jenna sees as exciting and flattering.|$|E
