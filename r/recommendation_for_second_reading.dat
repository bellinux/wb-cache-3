5000|$|The bill became Bill 35 in the 1998/1999 Parliamentary session, and was {{initially}} scheduled <b>for</b> <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> on 16 April 1999. As a bill modifying the monarch's prerogative powers, Queen's Consent was required {{before it could}} be debated in Parliament. The Queen, acting upon the advice of her government, refused to grant her consent for the Bill to be debated. The <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> {{was initially}} postponed from 16 April until 23 July 1999. [...] Due to the Crown's continuing refusal to signify its consent to the Bill being debated, it could not receive its <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> on 23 July 1999. In the absence of a request for a further postponement, the Bill was automatically dropped before it obtained its <b>second</b> <b>reading.</b>|$|R

The council sends them back to committees after the public hearing for further revision, and receives them for third reading after committees' approval. When a bill passed third reading, the council transmits it to the mayor for approval. Bills become law when the Mayor approves them.|$|R

His private member's bill on Capital Punishment received its first reading in the House of Commons on 24 June 2013, but was withdrawn, and so did not receive a <b>second</b> <b>reading.</b> Similarly, his Young Offenders (Parental Responsibility) Bill, Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the United Kingdom) Bill, Fishing Grounds and Territorial Waters (Repatriation) Bill, Asylum Seekers (Return to Nearest Safe Country) Bill, BBC Licence Fee (Civil Debt) Bill and Equality and Diversity (Reform) Bill, all due <b>for</b> <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> on 28 February 2014, were all withdrawn.

5000|$|It {{is quite}} {{possible}} for the first bill to take up all five hours, preventing any other bill on the agenda from being debated. Any bill not debated may receive <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> without debate {{at the end of}} the session, but a single shout of [...] "object!" [...] will delay consideration to a future date; Government and opposition whips routinely block contentious private members' bills in this way. Another date <b>for</b> <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> will also be set for bills which have been talked out. This is a formality; the bill will be put to the bottom of the order paper, will likely be objected to on each future occasion and has no practical chance of success.|$|R
50|$|Lord Addison and Lord Salisbury (then Lord Cranborne), the Conservative {{leader in}} the House of Lords from 1942 to 1957, both with {{memories}} of the troubles leading to {{the passing of the}} Parliament Act 1911, agreed that anything promised in a party's manifesto would eventually pass but that anything else would be subject to full debate. In its modern form, the convention still permits the offering of reasoned amendments to a motion <b>for</b> <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> of a Government bill, provided such amendments are not wrecking amendments designed to destroy the bill.|$|R

According to parliamentary convention, the Speaker votes, whenever possible, for the continuation of debate.
