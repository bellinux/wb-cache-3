40|$|Doing Psychoanalysis in Tehran is {{simultaneously}} a disappointing and <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>book.</b> It is disappointing {{because it is}} written more like a modern novel than a scholarly text, yet it is intriguing for just the same reason. Psychologists who would be attracted by the book’s title might expect a clear and concise treatise on methodological issues, on difficulties in adapting psychoanalysis to non-Eurocentric cultures, or on ideas about transcultural psychodynamic psychotherapy. What the book presents is the phenomenological experience of practicing psychoanalysis in Iran by an American-trained Iranian-native, Gohar Homayounpour, offering her personal reflections on starting her practice in Tehran.

The autobiography of a broken-down hackney-coach, would surely be as amusing as the autobiography of a broken-down hackneyed dramatist; and it might tell as much of its travels with the pole, as others have of their expeditions to it. How many stories might be related of the different people it had conveyed on matters of business or profit—pleasure or pain! And how many melancholy tales of the same people at different periods! The country-girl—the showy, over-dressed woman—the drunken prostitute! The raw apprentice—the dissipated spendthrift—the thief! ...|$|R

De passage naar Europa [The Passage to Europe] is <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>book</b> – creative, {{original}} and readable, {{but for a}} doctoral dissertation it is also remarkably devoid of theory. Van Middelaar introduces various interesting notions and ideas (European ‘discourses’, ‘policy spheres’ and ‘zones of interactions’), but these remain ambiguous, and therefore rather noncommittal. The book stands out for its interpretative richness, its analytical sensitivity and its imaginative prose. It lacks an overall theoretical framework, however. It fails to link up with the wider academic debate on European integration. </p...|$|R
60|$|There {{is another}} {{circumstance}} which facilitates {{the progress of}} the teacher. It is a fact that all this general progress has a direct and immediate bearing upon his pursuits. <b>A</b> lawyer may <b>read</b> in <b>an</b> evening <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>book</b> of travels, and find nothing to help him with his case, the next day, in court,--but almost every fact which the teacher thus learns, will come at once into use, in some of his recitations at school. We do not mean to imply by this that the members of the legal profession have not need of a great variety and extent of knowledge; they doubtless have. It is simply in the directness and certainty, with which the teacher's knowledge may be applied to his purpose, that the business of teaching has the advantage over every other pursuit.|$|R

40|$|The IRA: The Irish Republican Army is <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>book,</b> {{not least}} because it {{attempts}} a sociological {{as well as an}} historical and political analysis of the terrorist group that probably led the world in modern terrorism. This, naturally, will cause some controversy precisely because it attempts to analyse rather than just provide a narrative account of the IRA. As such it suggests a slightly older style than post-modernists or politically correct academics would appreciate and certainly places it in the ‘revisionist’ camp of Irish studies that tries to critically analyse the movement by applying a scientific method, in alternative to anti-revisionists who oppose ‘scientific’ Irish studies and try to maintain the traditional nationalist narrative (Brady 1995; Boyce & O’Day 1996) ...|$|R
60|$|For example, in Literature and Dogma {{and other}} books in which Arnold {{attempted}} {{to solve the}} problems of the age, he was apt to make large theories from a small knowledge of his subject. So in his Study of Celtic Literature (<b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>book,</b> by the way) he wrote with surprising confidence for one who had no first-hand acquaintance with his material, and led his readers pleasantly astray in the flowery fields of Celtic poetry. Moreover, he had one favorite method of criticism, which was to take the bad lines of one poet and compare them with the good lines of another,--a method which would make Shakespeare a sorry figure if he happened to be {{on the wrong side of}} the comparison.|$|R

As the authors pointed out, since experimental data in animal models suggested that incretins such as glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) and gastric intestinal polypeptide (GIP) stimulated bone formation and increased bone density (2), it is conceivable that DPP- 4 inhibitors could exert beneficial effects on the bone by increasing the levels of incretins.
