50|$|The {{tail rotor}} is a smaller rotor mounted {{so that it}} rotates {{vertically}} or near-vertically {{at the end of}} the tail of a traditional single-rotor helicopter. The tail rotor's position and distance from the center of gravity allow it to develop thrust in the same direction as the main <b>rotor's</b> <b>rotation,</b> to counter the torque effect created by the main rotor. Tail rotors are simpler than main rotors since they require only collective changes in pitch to vary thrust. The pitch of the tail rotor blades is adjustable by the pilot via the anti-torque pedals, which also provide directional control by allowing the pilot to rotate the helicopter around its vertical axis.|$|R
50|$|For a {{standard}} helicopter {{with a single}} main rotor, maintaining steady flight with a crosswind presents an additional flight control problem, where strong crosswinds from certain angles will increase or decrease lift from the main rotors. This effect is also triggered in a no-wind condition when moving the craft diagonally in various directions, depending on the direction of main <b>rotor</b> <b>rotation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Passive yaw {{systems have}} to be {{designed}} {{in a way that}} the nacelle does not follow the sudden changes in wind direction with too fast a yaw movement, in order to avoid high gyroscopic loads. Additionally the passive yaw systems with low yaw-friction are subjected to strong dynamic loads due to the periodic low amplitude yawing caused by the variation of the inertia moment during the <b>rotor</b> <b>rotation.</b> This effect becomes more severe with the reduction of the number of blades.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilize}} the yaw bearing against rotation a means of braking is necessary. One of the simplest ways to realize that task is to apply a constant small counter-torque at the yaw drives in order to eliminate the backlash between gear-rim and yaw drive pinions and to prevent the nacelle from oscillating due to the <b>rotor</b> <b>rotation.</b> This operation however greatly reduces {{the reliability of the}} electric yaw drives, therefore the most common solution is the implementation of a hydraulically actuated disk brake.|$|E

50|$|The third design {{considered}} is the Flettner Rotor. This {{is a large}} cylinder mounted {{upright on}} a ship's deck and mechanically spun. The effect of this spinning area {{in contact with the}} wind flowing around it creates a thrust effect that is used to propel the ship. Flettner Rotors were invented in the 1920s and have seen limited use since then. In 2010 a 10,000 dwt cargo ship was equipped with four Flettner Rotors to evaluate their role in increasing fuel efficiency. The only parameter of the Flettner Rotor requiring control is the speed of the <b>rotor's</b> <b>rotation,</b> so this method of wind propulsion requires very little operator input. In comparison to kite sails, Flettner rotors offer very similar efficiency gains {{depending on the size of}} sail used vs. size of the rotor.|$|R

50|$|In the {{aerodynamics}} of rotorcraft such as helicopters, {{phase lag}} {{refers to the}} angular difference between {{the point at which}} a control input to a rotor blade occurs and the point of maximum displacement of the blade in response to that control input, said displacement occurring in the direction of <b>rotor</b> <b>rotation.</b> Phase lag differs from advance angle in that the latter refers to the mechanically fixed angle between the pitch link attachments at the blade and swashplate. Phase lag can vary as a function on rotor tilt rate and aerodynamic damping and results in cross-coupling between the aircraft control axes; advance angle is fixed and cannot vary.|$|E
50|$|Phase lag (rotorcraft) {{will cause}} the extra lift to be seen {{approximately}} 90 degrees later in <b>rotor</b> <b>rotation</b> in semi-rigid two bladed rotor systems. Phase lag is a separate phenomenon from gyroscopic precession. Phase lag is a property of all rotating systems acted upon by a periodic force. For systems hinged at the axis of rotation (in our case, a semi rigid flapping type rotor head) the phase lag is 90 degrees. For systems that are hinged at {{some distance from the}} axis of rotation (such as a fully articulated rotor head) the phase lag is less than 90 degrees. The pilot will experience either a right or left roll (see flight dynamics), depending upon whether the rotor of the helicopter rotates clockwise or counter-clockwise.|$|E
50|$|The {{key element}} of a vacuum filler is the vacuum filling principle. The filling product is fed into the feed system {{mechanically}} via a hopper with actively driven feeding auger, as well as via vertical “vacuum suction”. Pre-evacuated cells of a vane cell feed system move underneath the hopper. The pressure difference relative to the ambient pressure (underpressure) caused by the evacuation ensures that the cells are filled with product. The feed system moves continuously, thus generating a continuous filling flow. The product is portioned by means of cyclic movements of the feed system. Each cell of the feed system has a particular volume. The portion {{is defined by the}} rotation distance of the rotor. The portioning volume is therefore set in the control system by multiplying the <b>rotor’s</b> <b>rotation</b> distance by the number of the feed system cells within it. The portion weight must be determined in the control system via the portion volume parameter with the aid of scales.|$|R

40|$|Flow {{visualization}} and particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) {{experiments were}} conducted in a water tank to investigate the effects of rotor wake and sediment properties on rotor-induced sediment mobilization during hover in ground effect. The two-phase flow was separated into the carrier phase and the dispersed phase for characterization. The carrier phase was studied using PIV to acquire time-resolved planar velocity measurements for a field of view within the rotor wake. The rotor-induced flow was confirmed {{to be dominated by}} blade tip vortices and was characterized primarily in terms of the vortex characteristics. Vortices were identified using a tracking function, and were compared to the Lamb-Oseen vortex velocity profile to evaluate their size and strength. The rotor-induced flow was also characterized in terms of wall-jet velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. The dispersed phase was separated using image filtering procedures and was quantified by identifying mobilized sediment particles visible in the field of view. Characteristics of the rotor-induced flow and quantification of sediment mobilization were each averaged over time for several <b>rotor</b> <b>rotations</b> to reduce the effects of wake aperiodicity and asymmetry.

5000|$|The passive yaw systems {{utilize the}} wind force {{in order to}} adjust the {{orientation}} of the wind turbine rotor into the wind. In their simplest form these system comprise a simple roller bearing connection between the tower and the nacelle and a tail fin mounted on the nacelle and designed {{in such a way that}} it turns the wind turbine rotor into the wind by exerting a [...] "corrective" [...] torque to the nacelle. Therefore, the power of the wind is responsible for the <b>rotor</b> <b>rotation</b> and the nacelle orientation. Alternatively in case of downwind turbines the tail fin is not necessary since the rotor itself is able to yaw the nacelle into the wind.

5000|$|In the {{simplest}} case without drift (i.e., {{the regime of}} uniform circular rotation), {{the tip of a}} reverberator rotates around a fixed point along the circumference of a certain radius (the circular motion of the tip of the reverberator). The autowave cannot penetrate into the circle bounded by this circumference. As far as it approaches the centre of the reverberator rotation, the amplitude of the excitation pulse is reduced, and, at a relatively low excitability of the medium there is a region of finite size in the centre of reverberator, where the amplitude of the excitation pulse is zero (recall that we speak now about a homogeneous medium, for each point of which its properties are the same). This area of low amplitude in the centre of the reverberator is usually called the core of the reverberator. The existence of such a region in the center of reverberator seems, at first glance, quite incomprehensible, as it borders all the time with the excited sites. A detailed investigation of this phenomenon showed that resting area in the centre of reverberator remains of its normal excitability, and the existence of a quiescent region in the centre of the reverberator is related to the phenomenon of the critical curvature. In the case of [...] "infinite" [...] homogeneous medium, the core radius and the speed of the <b>rotor</b> <b>rotation</b> are determined only by the properties of the medium itself, rather than the initial conditions. The shape of the front of the rotating spiral wave in the distance from the centre of rotation is close to the evolvent of the circumference - the boundaries of its core. [...] The certain size of the core of the reverberator is conditioned by that the excitation wave, which circulates in a closed path, should completely fit in this path without bumping into its own refractory tail.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of a rigid rotor supported on plain journal bearings was studied, focusing particular attention on its nonlinear aspects. Under {{the hypothesis that}} the motion of the rotor mass center is plane, the rotor has five lagrangian co-ordinates which are represented by the co-ordinates of the mass center and the three angular co-ordinates needed to express the <b>rotor's</b> <b>rotation</b> with respect to its center of mass. In such conditions, the system is characterised not only by the nonlinearity of the bearings but also by the nonlinearity due to the trigonometric functions of the three assigned angular co-ordinates. However, if two angular co-ordinates have values that are generally quite small because of the small radial clearances in the bearings, the system is de facto linear in these angular co-ordinates. Moreover, if the third angular co-ordinate is assumed to be cyclic [19], the number of degrees of freedom in the system is reduced to four and nonlinearity depends solely on the presence of the bearings, whose reactions were predicted with the short, * - film model of lubrication. After writing the equations of motion in this way and determining a numerical routine for a Runge-Kutta integration, the most significant aspects of the dynamics of a symmetrical rotor were studied, in the presence of either pure static or pure dynamic unbalance and also when both types of unbalance were present. Two categories of rotors, whose motion is prevailingly a cylindrical whirl or a conical whirl, were put under investigation...|$|R
