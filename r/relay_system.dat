30|$|Nevertheless, all {{the above}} works {{assume that the}} <b>relaying</b> <b>systems</b> operate in a noise-limited environment. However, future {{wireless}} communication networks tend to operate in an interference-limited environment due to aggressive frequency reuse. Motivated by this observation, many works have investigated the effect of co-channel interference (CCI) {{on the performance of}} the <b>relaying</b> <b>systems</b> in a variety of different scenarios. In [9], the authors proposed a relay selection algorithm for dual-hop CSI-assisted AF relaying networks in the presence of interference at the relay. In [10], the outage probabilities for both AF and DF <b>relaying</b> <b>systems</b> with noisy <b>relay</b> and interference-limited destination were derived. In [11], the authors investigated the outage performance of dual-hop fixed-gain <b>relaying</b> <b>systems</b> in the presence of interference at both the relay and destination and pointed out that the worst outage performance occurred when the power of interference at the relay and destination was equal. In [12, 13], the authors investigated the joint effects of imperfect channel estimation and CCI on the performance of dual-hop <b>relaying</b> <b>systems,</b> respectively. Most recently, some works addressed the case with Nakagami-m fading [14 – 18]. In [14], the authors studied the outage probability and the average BER of dual-hop fixed-gain AF <b>relaying</b> <b>systems</b> with a single interferer in Nakagami-m fading channels. In [15], the authors considered the performance of interference-limited dual-hop CSI-assisted AF systems in Nakagami-m fading channels. In [16], the outage probability of multi-branch dual-hop DF cooperative <b>relaying</b> <b>systems</b> with CCI over Nakagami-m fading channels was analyzed. In [17], the authors derived the exact closed-form expression for the outage probability of multi-hop transmission systems with AF and DF relaying protocols in Nakagami-m fading channels in the presence of CCI and made a comprehensive comparison between the two relaying protocols. In [18], the authors analyzed the ergodic capacity of dual-hop CSI-assisted AF <b>relaying</b> <b>system</b> with both CCI at the relay and destination.|$|R

Because these external stimuli would be blocked by the interruptions, this indicated that the ascending transmission must travel through the newly discovered ARAS.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{convention}} {{of moving the}} Olympic flame via a <b>relay</b> <b>system</b> from Greece to the Olympic venue began in 1936 in Germany. Carl Diem devised {{the idea of the}} torch relay for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin that was organized by the Nazis under the guidance of Joseph Goebbels. The Krupp armaments company produced the torches in wood and metal, inspired by an olive leaf. The Olympic flame was lit by a concave mirror in Olympia, Greece and transported over 3,187 kilometres by 3,331 runners in twelve days and eleven nights from Greece to Berlin. Leni Riefenstahl later staged the torch relay for the 1938 film Olympia. Adolf Hitler saw the link with the ancient Games as the perfect way to illustrate his belief that classical Greece was an Aryan forerunner of the modern German Reich. There were minor protests in Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia on the way, which were suppressed by the local security forces.|$|E

The torch is then taken out of Greece, most often to be taken around the country or continent where the Games are held. The Olympic torch is carried by athletes, leaders, celebrities, and ordinary people alike, and at times in unusual conditions, such as being electronically transmitted via satellite for Montreal 1976, submerged underwater without being extinguished for Sydney 2000, or in space and at the North Pole for Sochi 2014.
