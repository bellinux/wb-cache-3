25|$|Polk's {{other major}} {{domestic}} initiative was the lowering of the tariff, as Polk {{argued that the}} tariff should only {{be as high as}} necessary for the operation of the federal government. Though he had taken an ambivalent position on the tariff during the 1844 campaign in order to win Northern votes, Polk had long opposed a high tariff and viewed the protection of manufacturing interests as unfair to other economic activities. Polk directed Secretary of the Treasury Robert Walker to draft a new and lower tariff, which Polk submitted to Congress. After intense lobbying campaigns by both sides, the bill passed the House and, in a close vote that required Vice President Dallas to break a tie, the Senate. In 1846, Polk signed the Walker Tariff into law, substantially reducing the rates that had been set by the Whig-backed Tariff of 1842. The new law abandoned ad valorem tariffs and set rates independent of the monetary value of the product. Polk's lowering of the tariff was popular in the South and West; however, it was despised by many protectionists in the Northeast, especially Pennsylvania.

We present quantitative estimates of carbon leakage under the Kyoto Protocol with and without freer trade by means <b>of</b> import <b>tariff</b> <b>reductions</b> agreed to in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.

But we also find {{that the costs of}} abating the trade-induced leakage are modest relative to the welfare gains of freer trade. Analysis of the trade-induced carbon leakage shows large differences between leakage caused by <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> import <b>tariffs</b> on energy goods and by <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> import <b>tariffs</b> on non-energy goods.

Our empirical analysis by estimation of a multinomial logit model of Japanese firms' FDI choices reveals that the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> rates attracts even less productive VFDI firms. In contrast, their rise attracts even less productive HFDI firms. Since developing countries, particularly East Asian countries, have experienced a relatively rapid decrease in tariff rates, our results indicate that the increase <b>of</b> VFDI through <b>tariff</b> rate reduction has led to the recent relative surge of FDIs in developing countries. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the interface between}} trade and damages from invasive species (IS), focusing on escalation in tariffs between raw-input and processed-good markets, and its implication for IS-based damages. The current tariff escalation in processed agro-forestry products motivates our analysis. Tariff escalation exacerbates the likelihood of IS introduction by biasing trade flows towards increased trade of primary commodity flows and against processed-product trade. We show that a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> escalation, by lowering the tariff on processed goods increases allocative efficiency and reduces IS-based damages, a win-win situation. We also identify policy menus for trade reforms involving tariffs on both raw input and processed goods leading to win-win situations.

The results also show that the elimination of trade policy distortions has a strong, positive impact on import growth. Lastly, it is found that income and price elasticities are higher as a result of trade policy reform. trade liberalisation; import growth; dynamic panel data; time series/cross section; developing countries...|$|R
