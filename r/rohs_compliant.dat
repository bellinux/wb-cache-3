5000|$|Another {{potential}} problem that some lead-free, high tin-based solders may face is {{the growth of}} tin whiskers. These thin strands of tin can grow and make contact with an adjacent trace, developing a short circuit. Historically tin whiskers {{have been associated with}} a handful of failures, including a nuclear power plant shutdown and pacemaker incident where pure tin plating was used. However, these failures pre-date RoHS. They also do not involve consumer electronics, and therefore may employ RoHS-restricted substances if desired. To help mitigate {{potential problem}}s, lead-free manufacturers are using a variety of approaches such as tin-zinc formulations that produce non-conducting whiskers or formulations that reduce growth, although they do not halt growth completely in all circumstances. Fortunately, experience thus far suggests deployed instances of <b>RoHS</b> <b>compliant</b> products are not failing due to whisker growth. Dr. Ronald Lasky of Dartmouth College reports: [...] "RoHS has been in force for more than 15 months now, and ~$400B RoHS-compliant products have been produced. With all of these products in the field, no significant numbers of tin whisker-related failures have been reported." [...] Whisker growth occurs slowly over time, is unpredictable, and not fully understood, so time may be the only true test of these efforts. Whisker growth is even observable for lead-based solders, albeit on a much smaller scale.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results on investigation of lead-free and cadmium-free resisti-ve paste compositions based on calcium ruthenate (CaRuO 3) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2), that sheet resistance exceeds 10 kQ/q. Two regulations: Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE), and Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) were established on July the 1 st 2006. They forced the electronics equipment producers to discontinue using lead, cadmium {{and a few other}} substances. The Sur-face Mounted Devices (SMD) resistors, that exist in almost every modern electronic device contain thick film resistive layer, according to new regulations cannot contain hazardous substances. The series of new <b>RoHS</b> <b>compliant</b> resistor pastes with resistance range 10 Q/q- 10 kQ/q were elaborated by the authors in 2007. The RuO 2 was used as a functional component.

40|$|The Surface Mount Technology (SMT) {{industry}} has been faced with several challenges in the past decades. Two {{of the most recent}} ones are <b>RoHS</b> <b>compliant</b> lead-free assembly and the adoption of fine-pitch components assembly processes. Moreover, halogen-free is another new requirement for assembled PCB reliability, environmental and health concerns. All these requirements create fundamental challenges of developing a solder paste to satisfy everything. One of the resolutions for these challenges can be the development of the activator package with the advanced organic chemistry technology. Serial innovative activator system was developed recently for solder paste flux, tacky flux and liquid flux formulation. This paper will discuss three Type 4 lead-free halogen-free no-clean solder pastes (ROL 0) developed based on different innovative activators, which respond to the challenges described above. The printing performance, coalescence, wetting, BGA voiding and head-in-pillow characteristics, are compared and discussed in detail. The testing results show all three pastes with the new activators are fully capable of printing and reflowing 01005 components with different board/device finishes, even in air reflow. They can handle a wide variety of print variables, including print speed, long abandon time and a wide range of temperature and humidity.

40|$|Capacitor in C 0 G {{dielectric}} {{incorporates a}} unique, flexible termination {{system that is}} integrated with KEMET’s standard termination materials. A conductive silver epoxy is utilized between the base metal and nickel barrier layers of KEMET’s standard termination system {{in order to establish}} pliability while maintaining terminal strength, solderability and electrical performance. This technology was developed in order to address the primary failure mode of MLCCs – flex cracks, which are typically the result of excessive tensile and shear stresses produced during board flexure and thermal cycling. Flexible termination technology inhibits the transfer of board stress to the rigid ceramic body, therefore mitigating flex cracks which can result in low IR or short circuit failures. Although this technology does not eliminate the potential for mechanical damage that may propagate during extreme environmental and handling conditions, it does provide superior flex performance over standard termination systems. FT-CAP complements KEMET’s Open Mode, Floating Electrode (FE-CAP), Floating Electrode with Flexible Termination (FF-CAP), and KEMET Power Solutions (KPS) product lines by providing a complete portfolio of flex mitigation solutions.
