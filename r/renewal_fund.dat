50|$|Another {{focus was}} the {{waterfront}} and its decaying piers and warehouses. Norfolk, using Federal urban <b>renewal</b> <b>funds,</b> began large-scale demolitions downtown. This included slum housing that, in the mid-20th century, {{did not have}} indoor plumbing or access to running water. The former City Market, Norfolk Terminal Station (the Union railroad station) and The Monticello Hotel were also demolished.|$|R
50|$|North {{of these}} Plan West {{neighborhood}}s, the Bos en Lommer neighborhood was constructed the 1930s and 1940s.

The city of Amsterdam subsequently decided to apply the same status to De Baarsjes.|$|R
50|$|This {{community}} {{was not enough}} to prevent the demolition of portions of the Hayti district for the construction of the Durham Freeway during the late 1960s.The freeway construction resulted in losses to other historic neighborhoods, including Morehead Hills, West End, and West Durham. Combined with large-scale demolition using Urban <b>Renewal</b> <b>funds,</b> Durham suffered significant losses to its historic architectural base.|$|R

50|$|The FSA TDC was {{initially}} {{funded by the}} FSA followed {{by a grant from}} the Florida Department of Transportation Traffic Safety Office, which is reduced by 25% each year of <b>renewal.</b> <b>Funding</b> has been used to buy three vehicles, including two skid pad vehicles and a SUV used by the Program Coordinator to support the Sheriffs' Office programs and to help promote the program at public gatherings.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, federal urban <b>renewal</b> <b>funds</b> {{were used to}} {{demolish}} houses on {{the western edge of}} the neighborhood, which were considered [...] "slums" [...] and targeted for [...] "stabilization." [...] Several large new developments were built in their place. In 1967, Bolton Hill became a Baltimore City historic district, and in 1971 it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. As a result, the majority of the neighborhood was largely preserved.|$|R
25|$|Although Cleveland needed {{financial}} {{assistance from the}} federal government to both rebuild and address its extensive problems, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) cut off federal urban <b>renewal</b> <b>funding</b> to the city {{in the wake of the}} Hough Riots because the administrations of Mayor Locher and his predecessors had been so dilatory and incompetent in completing projects. HUD also cancelled an existing $10 million grant, and rejected Cleveland's Model Cities Program application for fear the city would misspend the funds.|$|R

50|$|TMCR {{was set up}} as a Restricted Service Licence or 'trial station' to see how {{it would}} be {{received}} by the communities of Thorne and Moorends. Supported by Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council, and with financial backing through the Neighbourhood <b>Renewal</b> <b>Fund,</b> a four-week period on-air was run from a studio in Thorne. Since starting full-time broadcast, TMCR has become a thriving community radio station going from strength to strength.|$|E
5000|$|The first LSPs {{were set}} up around the year 2000. For 88 local {{authority}} areas in England (the most deprived according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation) that received Neighbourhood <b>Renewal</b> <b>Fund</b> funding from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister [...] - [...] now the Department for Communities and Local Government [...] - [...] formation of an LSP was made a condition of receiving funding. In line with this source of funding, the work of most LSPs has {{tended to focus on}} 'regeneration and renewal'.|$|E
50|$|Involvement of the {{community}} is a key aspect of the government's vision of local strategic partnerships. Initially (with neighbourhood <b>renewal</b> <b>funding)</b> {{this was in the}} form of a community empowerment network (CEN). Again, the structure of the CEN is very much left up to the local voluntary and community sector. Often an umbrella body, for example a Council for Voluntary Service, will take on the role of co-ordinating the networks. Since dedicated funding for CENs ended around 50% of them have ceased to exist.|$|R
40|$|The 1954 {{revisions}} to the Federal Housing Act intended to address the shortcomings apparent in earlier urban renewal attempts. Under the "Workable Program," a series of provisions included in the revision, cities were required to address fundamental factors that created slums and continuously show progress towards the elimination of slums while receiving federal urban <b>renewal</b> <b>funds.</b> Requirements included addressing building codes, creating a comprehensive plan, ensuring meaningful citizen participation, and having relocation resources adequate for displaced residents. Fundamental factors contributing {{to the creation of}} slums in American cities not addressed in the Workable Program included racism, segregation, and containment policies. This paper presents evidence that the City of Milwaukee was able to effectively disregard Federal urban renewal regulations that required adequate relocation and necessary citizen participation in urban renewal planning and implementation, in order to continue racist policies of neighborhood segregation and containment. Although the Department of Housing and Urban Development had cut off urban <b>renewal</b> <b>funds</b> numerous times, the city was able to continue their policies by subverting the requirement of citizen participation and complying with HUD only as far as it opened up funding. Two neighborhoods, Midtown and K- 3, highlight the efforts of city officials to continue urban renewal efforts without addressing the restricted housing and segregated neighborhoods of the city...|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, {{the borough}} {{was subject to}} {{large-scale}} urban renewal projects initiated by the borough and city administrations as well as housing associations who owned many of the tower blocks. The original idea of functional separation between living, working, traffic, and recreation was abandoned. Tower blocks were demolished and replaced by small-scale, low-rise residential areas. In 2007 {{the eastern part of}} the Bijlmermeer neighborhood was marked aandachtswijk (disadvantaged neighborhood) by minister for housing Ella Vogelaar, which made national urban <b>renewal</b> <b>funds</b> and programmes available to the area.|$|R
50|$|Action Group members {{supported}} by a local police inspector and the Rector of Grimsby, appeared on the TV show Fortune: Million Pound Giveaway, appealing for funds to turn part of Saint Martin's church into a children's activity centre.The panel awarded them £45,000, while a further £330,000 came from the Neighbourhood <b>Renewal</b> <b>Fund.</b> The project was officially opened in 2008. The Respect Funhouse had a Laser Quest arena, a multi-screen video jukebox and a maze of play areas - tunnels, slides, ball pools and climbing areas - also music rooms and quiet rooms where teenagers and children could do their homework.|$|E
50|$|Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Community Association {{is based}} at a {{purpose-built}} community centre in Wootton Road. Activities include bingo and auctions. The centre was opened in 1985 by local snooker celebrity Ray Edmonds. The association existed from 1985 to 1994 and was re-established in 2004, following {{the dissolution of the}} Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Forum.In 2007 the association received £14,320 from the Neighbourhood <b>Renewal</b> <b>Fund</b> and Millennium Inorganic Chemicals. The money paid for alterations to the centre's ceiling, repairs to the heating system and the installation of safety glass in the doors and windows. In 2012 the centre was the scene of a disturbance involving local youths.|$|E
50|$|Social {{activities}} are organised by the West Marsh and St Hugh's community centres, and the Macaulay Area Action Group (MAAG) on Haycroft Avenue. MAAG {{has published a}} booklet {{about the history of}} the southern part of the West Marsh, between the River Freshney and Cromwell Road. This follows an earlier publication that dealt with the area north of the river. West Marsh Forward is a group, involving residents, which was established to bring funding from the Neighbourhood <b>Renewal</b> <b>Fund</b> (NRF) to projects in the area. Although NRF funding has been withdrawn, the Forward continues as a focus for the area. Other organisations include the West Marsh Local History Group and Haycroft Gardening Club.|$|E
50|$|In Atlanta {{there was}} a battle between {{competing}} visions. The city's political and business elite, and city planners, along with Atlanta's black middle class, wanted the federal funding to accelerate the economic growth of the entire city. They sought to protect the central business district property values from nearby slums and to construct new revenue-generating structures. However local community activists rallied poor residents in opposition to these plans. They said federal <b>renewal</b> <b>funding</b> {{should be used to}} replace deteriorating housing stock, whether with new public housing or low-cost housing built by private developers.|$|R
5|$|At Oregon's request, the U.S. Congress {{stripped}} the slough of its navigable status in 1978. This ended channel dredging on the slough, which {{could then be}} used for recreation. Other laws affecting the slough in the 1970s and beyond were the federal Clean Water Act and the Oregon Comprehensive Land Use Planning Act. In 1986, a business association began promoting commercial development along the upper slough, and the city later used urban <b>renewal</b> <b>funds</b> to support industrial projects near the airport. In 1996 the city acquired the Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, where it began a slough watershed education program for children.|$|R
25|$|A {{power grid}} failure {{paired with a}} newly rewritten city {{constitution}} – put into place to keep political power away from a single entity such as the railroad – created a standstill {{in the ability to}} further the local economy. Local businesses were affected as the sudden stop of loans limited progression of expansion and <b>renewal</b> <b>funds</b> for maintenance, leading to foreclosures. Families across the city experienced the fallout of economic depression as breadwinners sought to provide for their families. Shanty-town politics began to develop as the destitute needed some form of leadership to keep the peace.|$|R
