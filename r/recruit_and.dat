5|$|Had Napoleon {{succeeded in}} {{destroying}} the existing coalition forces south of Brussels {{before they were}} reinforced, {{he might have been}} able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war.

Similarly to the numbered Last Bible titles, players can <b>recruit</b> <b>and</b> fuse monsters in Another Bible.

5|$|Grant quickly {{raised and}} {{recruited}} {{a company of}} volunteers, and was given the captaincy, accompanying them to Springfield. He perceived that the war would be fought mostly by volunteers, not career soldiers. Governor Richard Yates offered Grant a militia commission to <b>recruit</b> <b>and</b> train volunteer units, which he accepted, but still wanted a field command. He made several efforts through his professional contacts. Major General George B. McClellan refused to see him, remembering the day in Oregon in 1853 when he saw Grant on a drunken spree. With the aid of his advocate, Representative Elihu B. Washburne of Illinois, Grant was promoted to Colonel on June 14 and charged with disciplining the unruly 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Transferred to northern Missouri, Grant was promoted to Brigadier General, backdated to May 17, 1861.|$|E

5|$|One of the Smith government's first actions was {{to crack}} {{down hard on the}} black {{nationalist}} political violence that had erupted following the establishment of a second black nationalist organisation, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), by disgruntled ZAPU members in Tanzania in August 1963. The rival movements were split tribally, ZAPU being mostly Ndebele and ZANU predominantly Shona, and politically—ZAPU, which had relabelled itself the People's Caretaker Council (PCC) within Southern Rhodesia to circumvent its ban, was Marxist–Leninist and backed by the Warsaw Pact and its allies, while ZANU had aligned itself with Maoism and the bloc headed by communist China. Their respective supporters in the black townships clashed constantly, also targeting non-aligned blacks whom they hoped to <b>recruit,</b> <b>and</b> sporadically attacked whites, businesses and police stations.|$|E

5|$|The Runaway Scrape events {{took place}} mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, {{and were the}} {{evacuations}} by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas {{and much of the}} civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to <b>recruit</b> <b>and</b> train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna.|$|E
5|$|At the outset, the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and USCG {{agreed to}} <b>recruit</b> <b>and</b> {{to train the}} members of their {{respective}} women's reserves together, using existing Navy facilities. For recruiting purposes, the SPARS would utilize the Offices of the Naval Officer Procurement. Their first recruiting efforts got underway in December 1942, but they were hampered somewhat {{by the absence of}} SPAR recruiting personnel. Their absence resulted from the agreement between the Navy and the USCG, whereby the SPARS would receive its first personnel by transfer from the WAVES. A total of 15 WAVE officers and 153 WAVE enlisted women requested and were discharged from the WAVES to become the first SPARS. Eventually, SPAR officers were assigned to most of the Naval Officer Procurement offices. The recruiting information about SPARS was disseminated with WAVES publicity materials and it was also done separately. But it became apparent that the job of selling the SPARS included selling the USCG as well.|$|E
5|$|Hautpoult {{had fought}} hard during the {{engagement}} and was badly damaged, suffering between 80 and 90 casualties. Pompee was also badly damaged, losing nine killed and 30 wounded, including Fahie wounded. Other casualties were suffered on Castor, with one killed and five wounded; Neptune one killed and four wounded and Recruit one wounded. In total, British losses were 11 killed and 40 wounded. Cochrane ordered Pompee {{and the newly}} captured French ship back to port, promoting Napier to command the ship of the line for his service on <b>Recruit</b> <b>and</b> despatching York and Captain to hunt for Troude's remaining squadron. Despite their efforts, Troude evaded pursuit and eventually reached Cherbourg in May. In addition to Napier there were further promotions and awards and Hautpoult was taken into the Royal Navy as HMS Abercromby. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E

5|$|Initial plans {{called for}} {{operations}} to commence on 1January 2000, but this soon proved difficult. In November, NSB paid {{out the other}} major shareholders, and were left with an 89% ownership of the company. The company needed dispensation from the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority to allow temporary employments of engineers. When the company had announced the positions, only one engineer had applied for the twelve jobs. Instead an agreement was made with NSB to rent personnel, thus delaying the start until 3September. But because the engineers needed to be recertified, the start was delayed again, to 5November. In the end, Timetoget was forced to <b>recruit</b> <b>and</b> train new drivers. It received criticism for not having as extensive training as NSB, but the company stated that this would not affect safety. The labor union recommended its members not to apply for jobs with Timetoget, since they did not provide a pension agreement, collective bargaining or guarantees to return to NSB, should the concept fail.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} year, still seeking a league, the US-based North American Hockey League, which {{was looking to}} expand, was {{approached}} as a possibility. In an April 2009 announcement, they accepted the Dawson Creek franchise, {{which would be the}} only Canadian team in the league and the first since the Fernie Ghostriders left the league in 2004 to become a Junior B team. The ownership group agreed to pay the $400,000 franchise fee with the team entering the league for the 2010–11 season with 31 home games to be played in the Multiplex each season. The local government, the City of Dawson Creek, agreed to contribute $675,000 over 3 years to help establish the team as a reliable tenant for the Multiplex which was operating at a loss {{due to the lack of}} events. The team, now known as the Dawson Creek Rage, selected Scott Robinson, a former BCHL coach of the year, to lead the new team as its general manager and head coach. To <b>recruit</b> <b>and</b> evaluate potential players (aged 15–20), they held Spring 2010 try-out camps in Princeton, Abbotsford and Dawson Creek which attracted about 200 players.|$|E
