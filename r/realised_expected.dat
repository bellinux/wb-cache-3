40|$|This paper investigates {{whether or}} not the share prices of soccer clubs listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Alternative Investment Market are {{influenced}} by the soccer teams' weekly sporty performances. Event studies corrected for thin trading and with Baysian updating reveal that at the first day of trading after a game, positive abnormal returns almost 1 % were <b>realised</b> <b>expected</b> following a soccer victory. In contrast, defeats or draws are penalised, respectively, by negative abnormal returns of 1. 4 % and 0. 6 %. Cumulatively over the week, defeats and draws trigger abnormal losses of 2. 5 % and 1. 7 %. These findings are consistent across the English and Scottish, national Cup and European competitions. Much larger abnormal returns are generated subsequent to promotion and relegation games as the Premier League and European games guarantee substantially higher (future) income in terms of television broadcasting rights and sponsoring income. Whereas victories seem to be more rewarded by share price increases for those clubs listed on the LSE in comparison to those listed on the AIM, defeats lead to larger price reductions for AIM listed clubs. In spite of the sporty performance sensitivity of listed soccer clubs and the excellent share price performance of certain clubs like Manchester United, Sunderland and Celtic, Jensen's alpha and the Sharpe ratio of an equally weighted investment in listed soccer clubs since 1996 points out that such an investment has substantially underperformed the market index. ...|$|E

40|$|As {{international}} competition continues to intensify, {{significant numbers of}} organisations are investing large amounts of resources into {{information and communication technologies}} as they seek to gain competitive advantage. Information Technology (IT) is increasingly being implemented for strategic reasons, so as to enable improved efficiency and to improve the control and productivity of internal processes. However, the failure of <b>realising</b> <b>expected</b> IT-induced benefits has led to a growing number of senior executives to question the value of IT investments. This research study was inspired by the perceived lack of a structured framework for the life cycle management of innovative IT projects (ProjectIT). Such a framework consists of three modules representing each phase of the IT project life cycle, namely, IT project selection (SelectIT), strategic IT implementation (ImplementIT) and IT performance evaluation (EvaluateIT). Moreover, industry practitioners require a user-friendly software tool to assist them to undertake this arduous task. This paper provides a description of each module of the ProjectIT framework and the current progress towards the development of the companion software package. ProjectIT should assist firms to rapidly select IT projects based on a range of monetary and non-monetary benefits and risks, implement these projects in a well-planned strategic manner and evaluate the short- and long-term value generated from them.

40|$|Conference Theme: Intelligent built {{environment}} for lifeInfrastructure {{lies at the}} very heart of social and economic development of a country and the world at large. Yet, despite its importance the delivery outcomes of infrastructure projects have been far from satisfactory. Infrastructure projects face issues of cost and schedule overruns as well as failure to <b>realise</b> <b>expected</b> benefits. Research in the field of project management has emphasized the importance of a 'strong owner' to the success of projects. To act as strong owners, public sector clients that deliver infrastructure projects need to have project capabilities to perform various roles. This paper presents an initial framework on how public sector clients can develop 'owner project capabilities', so as to improve infrastructure project delivery outcomes. The theoretical perspective of dynamic capabilities is employed to study how these public sector clients can develop the requisite 'owner project capabilities'. It is suggested that learning is the mechanism by which owner project capabilities are developed, based on the concept of routines development, and argues for the incorporation of the organizational learning theory within the dynamic capabilities framework. Theoretically the paper contributes to the extension of the current application of organizational capabilities into the public sector infrastructure context. Additionally, it also provides initial insights into the relationship between owner project capabilities and (organizational) learning; and the difficulties faced by public sector clients during the process of capability development...|$|R

40|$|Discussion paper. Final version {{published}} in Review of Behavioral Finance, Vol. 3 Iss: 1, pp. 1 - 26 In this paper, {{it is argued}} that previous estimates of the expected cost of equity and the expected arithmetic risk premium in the UK show a degree of upward bias. Given the importance of the risk premium in regulatory cost of capital in the UK, this has important policy implications. There are three reasons why previous estimates could be upward biased. The first two arise from the comparison of estimates of the realised returns on Government Bond (“Gilt”) to <b>realised</b> and <b>expected</b> returns on equities. These estimates are frequently used to infer a risk premium relative to either the current yield on index-linked gilts or an “adjusted” current yield measure. This is incorrect on two counts; first, inconsistent estimates of the risk free rate are implied on the right hand side of the CAPM (Jenkinson, 1993); second, they compare realised returns from a bond which carried inflation risk with <b>realised</b> and <b>expected</b> returns from equities which may be expected to have at least some protection from inflation risk. The third, and most important, source of bias arises from uplifts to expected returns. If markets exhibit “excess volatility” (Shiller 1981), or if part of the historical return arises because of revisions to expected future cash flows, then estimates of variance derived from historical returns or price growth must be used with great care when uplifting average expected returns to derive simple discount rates. Adjusting expected returns for the effect of such biases leads to lower expected cost of equity and risk premia than those that are typically quoted...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the motives}} for mergers have {{increasingly}} changed from cost-driven mergers to market-driven mergers, which intend {{to improve the}} market position, to enlarge the product portfolio or {{to get access to}} new markets. Therefore, integrating the marketing and sales (M&S) area plays a significant role to achieve the merger goals. M&S is the only business area with direct interface to customers. As a result, post-merger integration (PMI) activities in M&S have direct impact on customer relationships. However, various empirical studies reveal that companies have real problems to <b>realise</b> the <b>expected</b> benefits. To find an answer to this phenomenon, the author investigates possible reasons and identifies the neglect of the PMI phase and the missing expertise how to merge M&S as the major bottlenecks.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Numerous studies have concluded that roughly half of all implemented software requirements are never or rarely used in practice, and that failure to <b>realise</b> <b>expected</b> benefits is {{a major cause of}} software project failure. This thesis presents an exploration of these concepts, claims, and causes. It evaluates the literature s proposed solutions to them, and then presents a unified framework that covers additional concerns not previously considered. The value of a requirement is assessed often during the requirements engineering (RE) process, e. g., in requirement prioritisation, release planning, and trade-off analysis. In order to support these activities, and hence to support the decisions that lead to the aforementioned waste, this thesis proposes a framework built on the modelling languages of Goal Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE), and on the principles of Value Based Software Engineering (VBSE). The framework guides the elicitation of a requirement s value using philosophy and business theory, and aims to quantitatively model chains of instrumental value that are expected to be generated for a system s stakeholders by a proposed software capability. The framework enriches the description of the individual links comprising these chains with descriptions of probabilistic degrees of causation, non-linear dose-response and utility functions, and credibility and confidence. A software tool to support the framework s implementation is presented, employing novel features such as automated visualisation, and information retrieval and machine learning (recommendation system) techniques. These software capabilities provide more than just usability improvements to the framework. For example, they enable visual comprehension of the implications of what-if? questions, and enable re-use of previous models in order to suggest modifications to a project s requirements set, and reduce uncertainty in its value propositions. Two case studies in real-world industry contexts are presented, which explore the problem and the viability of the proposed framework for alleviating it. The thesis research questions are answered by various methods, including practitioner surveys, interviews, expert opinion, real-world examples and proofs of concept, as well as less-common methods such as natural language processing analysis of real requirements specifications (e. g., using TF-IDF to measure the proportion of software requirement traceability links that do not describe the requirement s value or problem-to-be-solved). The thesis found that in general, there is a disconnect between the state of best practice as proposed by the literature, and current industry practice in requirements engineering. The surveyed practitioners supported the notion that the aforementioned value realisation problems do exist in current practice, that they would be treatable by better requirements engineering practice, and that this thesis proposed framework would be useful and usable in projects whose complexity warrants the overhead of requirements modelling (e. g., for projects with many stakeholders, competing desires, or having high costs of deploying incorrect increments of software functionality) ...|$|R

South African savings rates have been declining with household savings showing a significant deterioration over the past two decades. Policymakers are primarily occupied with investigating methods to encourage savings and control consumption levels. However there remains some ambiguity regarding the variables that impact household savings behaviour. Higher domestic savings can assist with improving South Africa’s GDP growth rate, which has not <b>realised</b> the <b>expected</b> targets in recent years. The Vector Error Correction Model approach was applied to determine the long-run impact of certain variables on the household savings rate and household debt ratio. The study employed annual time series data over the 20 -year period 1994 to 2013. Variables that were studied in relation to the household savings rate included youth dependency, elderly dependency, financial liberalisation and financial deepening. The impacts of financial liberalisation and financial deepening were also examined against the household debt ratio. Findings revealed that household savings are negatively impacted by youth dependency. Results for elderly dependency and financial deepening had weak explanatory power on household savings. Financial deepening was found to significantly increase household debt levels whilst the results concerning financial liberalisation were inconclusive for both the household debt and household savings variables.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper contributes to the Higher Education (HE) and enterprise systems literature through an in-depth study of an enterprise system, SITS, implementation within a university in the UK. The study was undertaken over a three year period where one of the authors was embedded within the organisation. Findings: Using a cultural analysis framework the extensive rich data was analysed and the outcomes indicate that SITS has had a huge influence on the culture of the university; the technology’s rigid structure has imposed many changes that had not been anticipated. Originality/value: ES have recently emerged in the higher education sector where they are intended to support the management of student data and provide strategic management information. Although there are many studies which have explored important aspects of the implementation of enterprise systems, one area that appears to have been under-researched is how these systems are implicated in culture change within organisations. The results of this study will enable managers as well as IT specialists to gain rich insights into an ES implementation in the HE sector and to use this knowledge for future implementations...|$|R

Least squares Monte Carlo methods can be used but {{the sign of the}} error is difficult to determine. In this paper, we propose new model independent upper and lower pricing bounds for VIX derivatives. In particular, we first present a general stochastic duality result on payoffs involving concave functions. This is then applied to VIX derivatives along with minor adjustments to handle issues caused by the square root function. The upper bound involves the evaluation of a variance swap, while the lower bound involves estimating a martingale increment corresponding to its hedging portfolio. Both can be achieved simultaneously using a single linear least square regression. Numerical results show that the method works very well for VIX futures, calls and puts under a wide range of parameter choices...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} the benefit realisation process for ERP systems so as to develop a benefit realization road map whereby organisations can realize the maximum potential of their ERP systems. This research covers two areas: mechanism of implementation and the destination to change (i. e. road map). It {{has been found that}} project management and benefits management approaches are necessary for recouping benefits from investing in Information Technologies (IT) projects. Thus, Project Benefits Governance Framework (PBGF) is developed, and later tested, by combining the two approaches for the sake of <b>realising</b> the <b>expected</b> benefits from investing in IT initiatives. Because ERP demands radical changes in organisations, the neo-institutionalisation theory was adopted to apply PBGF on ERP so that the ERP success is improved. The key connecting element between PM and BM in PGBF is the blueprint design. ERP orchestration framework is developed to show how investments in ERP resources and organisational complementary resources shall be orchestrated so that ERP benefits can be realised effectively. Thus, benefits are classified into three levels (automating, planning, and innovating benefits), and each level needs a specific blueprint. All of these blueprints constitute the ERP benefits road map. Each blueprint consists of attitudes, skills, organisation characteristics, technologies, and ERP department human resources competencies. Based on these results, ERP Business Innovation framework is developed and tested. ERP benefits maturity assessment tool is developed for assessing organisations’ status to show weaknesses and strengths in their ability to recoup different ERP benefits by benchmarking with the three blueprints. This research has contributed by integrating and institutionalising benefits management practices and project management practices. Moreover, it is novel in adapting the orchestration theory to understand how ERP resources shall be composed to achieve benefits efficiently. Finally, it demonstrates that ERP can be a source of innovation if the innovating benefits are managed deliberately...|$|R
