5|$|Radicals such as Sir Francis Burdett {{believed}} that Magna Carta {{could not be}} <b>repealed,</b> but in the 19th century clauses which were obsolete or had been superseded began to be <b>repealed.</b> The repeal of clause 36 in 1829, by the Offences against the Person Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4 c. 31 s. 1), {{was the first time}} a clause of Magna Carta was <b>repealed.</b> Over the next 140 years, nearly the whole of Magna Carta (1297) as statute was <b>repealed,</b> leaving just clauses 1, 9, and 29 still in force (in England and Wales) after 1969. Most of the clauses were <b>repealed</b> in England and Wales by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863, and in modern Northern Ireland and also in the modern Republic of Ireland by the Statute Law (Ireland) Revision Act 1872.|$|E
5|$|The Act was <b>repealed</b> by the Statute Law Revision Act 1966. In the Republic of Ireland, {{where it}} had ceased to have force after independence, it was {{formally}} <b>repealed</b> as obsolete by the Statute Law Revision Act 1983. In India, it was identified by the Law Commission of India in 1957 as being no longer useful, and accordingly was <b>repealed</b> by the British Statutes (Application To India) Repeal Act, 1960.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Congress <b>repealed</b> {{termination}} {{and restored}} federal {{recognition of the}} Menominee tribe. The Menominee Restoration Act was signed by Richard Nixon; it <b>repealed</b> the Menominee Indian Termination Act, reopened the tribal rolls, re-established the trust status and provided for the reformation of tribal government. The tribe was the first terminated tribe to be restored to trust and recognition status. The Restoration Act signaled {{the end of the}} termination era.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{campaign}} for the <b>repeal</b> of a particular law gains particular momentum, an advocate of the <b>repeal</b> might become known as a [...] "repealer". The <b>Repeal</b> Association in 19th-century Ireland advocated Irish independence through <b>repeal</b> of the Acts of Union 1800.|$|R
60|$|First, then: If {{that country}} was {{in need of}} a {{territorial}} organization, could it not have had it as well without as with a <b>repeal?</b> Iowa and Minnesota, to both of which the Missouri restriction applied, had, without its <b>repeal,</b> each in succession, territorial organizations. And even the year before, a bill for Nebraska itself was within an ace of passing without the <b>repealing</b> clause, and this {{in the hands of the}} same men who are now the champions of <b>repeal.</b> Why no necessity then for <b>repeal?</b> But still later, when this very bill was first brought in, it contained no <b>repeal.</b> But, say they, because the people had demanded, or rather commanded, the <b>repeal,</b> the <b>repeal</b> was to accompany the organization whenever that should occur.|$|R
50|$|Council members M.C. Keegan-Ayer and Jessica Fitzwater {{introduced}} a bill to <b>repeal</b> an ordinance designating English as the county's official language. Rather than <b>repeal</b> the ordinance altogether, Chmelik suggested keeping the ordinance in place while asking Council members to only <b>repeal</b> offensive parts of it. The Council did not approve Chmelik's idea. The bill to <b>repeal</b> the ordinance passed; Chmelik voted against the <b>repeal.</b>|$|R
5|$|The formal {{monopoly}} was <b>repealed</b> {{after six}} years, but the drapers usually managed to exclude competitors.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, {{the first}} law enacted by the Allied Control Council {{abolished}} all Nazi symbols and <b>repealed</b> all relevant laws.

50|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to gain enough support to force a referendum, with a quorum of 25% of registered voters required - equivalent to 589,823 voters. The first attempt gained 448,265 in favour for a partial <b>repeal</b> and 21,473 for a full <b>repeal.</b> The second effort obtained 693,668 for a partial <b>repeal</b> and 14,960 for a full <b>repeal.</b> On 15 October 1992 the Electoral Court decided on a referendum on a partial <b>repeal.</b>|$|R

5|$|By 1826, {{economic}} prosperity {{was beginning to}} return to the state. The Old Court party augmented their majority in the House and gained a majority in the Senate. One legislator's proposition to resolve the controversy was to call for the resignation of the governor and lieutenant governor, the entire General Assembly, as well as the justices from both the Old and New Courts, essentially allowing the state to reset its entire government. This extreme measure was rejected. Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly <b>repealed</b> the reorganization act, and overrode Governor Desha's veto of the measure. They also <b>repealed</b> the replevin law that had touched off the controversy. On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in his possession to the Old Court.|$|E
5|$|From 1553, {{under the}} reign of Henry's Roman Catholic daughter, Mary I, the Reformation {{legislation}} was <b>repealed</b> and Mary sought to achieve the reunion with Rome.

5|$|In December 2015, Ryan led the {{bipartisan}} effort {{to pass the}} Every Student Succeeds Act, which, among other things, fully <b>repealed</b> No Child Left Behind and severely limited the federal government's ability to impose and enforce national education standards such as Common Core.|$|E

5|$|No {{treaties}} which {{shall be}} directly {{opposed to the}} existing laws of the United States in Congress assembled shall be valid until such laws shall be <b>repealed,</b> or made conformable to such treaty; nor shall any treaty be valid which is contradictory to the Constitution of the United States.|$|E
50|$|On November 30, 2010, the Department of Defense's Comprehensive Review Working Group (CRWG) on DADT <b>repeal</b> {{issued its}} formal report {{outlining}} {{a path to}} the implementation of <b>repeal</b> of DADT. The report indicated that there was low risk of service disruptions because of <b>repeal</b> of the ban. Gates encouraged Congress to act quickly to <b>repeal</b> the law so that the military could carefully adjust rather than face a court decision requiring it to lift the policy immediately. The United States Senate held two days of hearings on December 2 and 3, 2010, to consider the CRWG report. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs Chairman Michael Mullen urged immediate <b>repeal.</b> The heads of the Marine Corps, Army, and Navy all advised against immediate <b>repeal</b> and expressed varied views on its eventual <b>repeal.</b>|$|R

50|$|Implied <b>repeal</b> occurs {{where two}} {{statutes}} are mutually inconsistent. The effect {{is that the}} later statute <b>repeals</b> the earlier statute pro tanto (in {{so far as it}} is inconsistent). As past and future parliaments are equally sovereign, later parliaments can carry out implied <b>repeal</b> of earlier statute by passing an inconsistent statute, but inconsistency needs to be established before implied <b>repeal</b> can occur.|$|R
5|$|Section 14 was <b>repealed</b> by § 17 of the Crimes Act of 1825, which {{broadened the}} offense of {{counterfeiting}} and reduced authorized the punishment from death to 10 years hard labor and a $5000 fine. Sections 18 through 21 of the 1825 Act created additional counterfeiting offenses.|$|E
5|$|Section 207 <b>repealed</b> {{obsolete}} {{limitations on}} wastage in the Mint's operations, but directed that administrative regulations be developed on the subject, {{which could be}} more easily changed. Section 208 <b>repealed</b> a provision of the 1873 act requiring coinage dies for the obverse, which are dated, to be destroyed {{at the end of}} each year. Section 209 rephrased statutory provisions allowing the Treasury to sell silver at a price not less than $1.292929 per ounce, and allowed it to sell silver to other government departments for less. Section 210 <b>repealed</b> the 1933 provision regarding the legal tender status of coins.The law prior to 1965 made it a felony to forge silver coins; this was amended by section 211 to forbid the counterfeiting of coins with denomination greater than five cents. Section 212 made using coins as security for loans a misdemeanor if the secretary hasemade a proclamation in the Federal Register proscribing their use as collateral.|$|E
5|$|The Act was <b>repealed</b> and {{replaced}} by the Royal Assent Act of 1967. However section 1(2) of that Act does not prevent the sovereign from declaring assent in person {{if he or she}} so desires.|$|E

25|$|Though he knew <b>repealing</b> {{the laws}} {{would mean the}} end of his ministry, Peel decided to do so. It is {{possible}} that Peel merely used the Irish Famine as an excuse to <b>repeal</b> the Corn Laws as he had been an intellectual convert to free trade since the 1820s. Blake points out that if Peel were convinced that total <b>repeal</b> was necessary to stave off the famine, he would have enacted a bill that brought about immediate temporary <b>repeal,</b> not permanent <b>repeal</b> over a three-year period of gradual tapering-off of duties.|$|R
60|$|Slavery {{is founded}} in the {{selfishness}} of man's nature,--opposition to it in his love of justice. These principles are in eternal antagonism, and when brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings them, shocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow. <b>Repeal</b> the Missouri Compromise; <b>repeal</b> all compromises; <b>repeal</b> the Declaration of Independence; <b>repeal</b> all past history,--you still cannot <b>repeal</b> human nature. It still will be the abundance of man's heart that slavery extension is wrong, {{and out of the}} abundance of his heart his mouth will continue to speak....|$|R
5|$|The Afroyim {{decision}} {{stated that}} no one with United States citizenship could be involuntarily deprived of that citizenship. Nevertheless, the Court distinguished a 1971 case, Rogers v. Bellei, holding in this newer case that individuals who had acquired citizenship via jus sanguinis, through birth outside the United States to an American parent or parents, could still risk loss of citizenship in various ways, since their citizenship (unlike Afroyim's citizenship) {{was the result of}} federal statutes rather than the Citizenship Clause. The statutory provision whereby Bellei lost his citizenship—a U.S. residency requirement which he had failed to satisfy in his youth—was <b>repealed</b> by Congress in 1978; the foreign voting provision, already without effect since Afroyim, was <b>repealed</b> at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The Gomez {{incident}} {{also led}} to a review and proposal by the Federal Government in August 1993 to disband the Johor Military Force (JMF). However, the bill to disband the JMF was subsequently <b>repealed</b> by parliament.|$|E
