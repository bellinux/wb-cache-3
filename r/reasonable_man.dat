25|$|The {{reasonable}} suspicion {{test has}} {{the intention of}} protecting public confidence, but Leo and Chen wonder how accurately this test actually reflects the public's view. The test as formulated in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin requires that the <b>reasonable</b> <b>man</b> be sitting in court and in the know of all the relevant facts. However, this is usually not the case. Most of the public only receives information in bits and pieces, and thus even if a case passes the reasonable suspicion test, the public may not be satisfied {{that there was no}} possibility of bias. Thus the concept that the reasonable suspicion test reflects the public's perspective is overstated. The practical reality is that when the <b>reasonable</b> <b>man</b> is imbued with all the relevant facts, he will essentially be in the same position as the court. Therefore, the suggested approach is that the court, in personifying the <b>reasonable</b> <b>man,</b> should take into account all relevant circumstances and determine if there is the suspicion or possibility of the appearance of bias whilst being mindful to exclude considerations stemming from the individual judge's personal preferences, special knowledge and legal sophistication.|$|E
25|$|United States Special Envoy for the Korean Peace Talks, Charles Kartman, who was {{involved}} in the 2000 Madeleine Albright summit with Kim, characterised Kim as a <b>reasonable</b> <b>man</b> in negotiations, to the point, but {{with a sense of humor}} and personally attentive to the people he was hosting. However, psychological evaluations conclude that Kim Jong-il's antisocial features, such as his fearlessness in the face of sanctions and punishment, served to make negotiations extraordinarily difficult.|$|E

25|$|Thus, in general, the {{commonly}} perceived {{differences between the}} two tests relate to the stringency and the perspective of the inquiry the court takes when applying each test. The reasonable suspicion test is usually considered to be of a less stringent standard as compared to the real likelihood of bias test. The reasonable suspicion test is also thought to be applied {{from the perspective of the}} public (or in the eyes of a <b>reasonable</b> <b>man),</b> while the real likelihood of bias test is applied from the court's perspective.|$|E
25|$|Even the {{youngest}} children quickly learn that, {{with varying degrees}} of probability, consequences flow from physical acts and omissions. The more predictable the outcome, the greater the likelihood that the actor caused the injury or loss intentionally. There are many ways in which the law might capture this simple rule of practical experience: that there is a natural flow to events, that a <b>reasonable</b> <b>man</b> in the same situation would have foreseen this consequence as likely to occur, that the loss flowed naturally from the breach of contractual duties or tortuous actions, etc. However it is phrased, the essence of the degree of fault attributed will lie in the fact that reasonable people try to avoid injuring others, so if harm was foreseeable, there should be liability {{to the extent that the}} extent of the harm actually resulting was foreseeable.|$|E
25|$|Avitus, at the Visigothic {{court in}} Burdigala, {{declared}} himself Emperor. He moved on Rome with Visigothic support which gained his acceptance by Majorian and Ricimer, commanders {{of the remaining}} army of Italy. This {{was the first time}} that a barbarian kingdom had played a key role in the imperial succession. Avitus's son-in-law Sidonius wrote propaganda to present the Visigothic king Theoderic II as a <b>reasonable</b> <b>man</b> with whom a Roman regime could do business. Theoderic's payoff included precious metal from stripping the remaining public ornaments of Italy, and an unsupervised campaign in Hispania. There he not only defeated the Sueves, executing his brother-in-law Rechiar, but he also plundered Roman cities. The Burgundians expanded their kingdom in the Rhone valley and the Vandals took the remains of the Diocese of Africa. In 456 the Visigothic army was too heavily engaged in Hispania to be an effective threat to Italy, and Ricimer had just destroyed a pirate fleet of sixty Vandal ships; Majorian and Ricimer marched against Avitus and defeated him near Placentia. He was forced to become Bishop of Placentia, and died (possibly murdered) a few weeks later.|$|E

500|$|The {{application}} of this rule differs depending on the technical nature of the job and the competencies on the occupier. Haseldine v CA Daw & Son Ltd [...] established that the more technical a job is, the more reasonable it is to entrust it to an independent contractor, while in Woodward v The Mayor of Hastings [...] {{the court held that}} an occupier is not always absolved from liability if they have entrusted the job to a competent person; an occupier is required to take the kind of care that a <b>reasonable</b> <b>man</b> in his place would take.|$|E
500|$|The {{requirement}} that the action be dangerous was confirmed in R v Newbury, which applied the previous reasoning on R v Church: [...] "the unlawful act must be such that all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise it as an act which must subject the other person to at least the risk of some harm resulting therefrom albeit not serious harm". This is an (almost completely) objective test, it disregards whether the defendant in particular foresaw the danger, and requires only that it would create a risk of some harm. The ordinary person knows only what the defendant did, at least {{in relation to the}} susceptibility of the victim. R v Ball did, however, create a class of dangerous [...] that of the act itself [...] where the jury knew more than the defendant; in this case, whilst the defendant knew he was loading a blank cartridge, the jury was entitled to ascribe knowledge that it might be a live cartridge to the <b>reasonable</b> <b>man.</b> This has been criticised, and may not have been necessary. The act need not be directed at the victim: the killing of an innocent bystander by mistake could be manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that despite a [...] "potentially gimmicky tone", the episode provided [...] "a {{lot of fun}} moments along with a little emotional content as well. The show usually balanced sentimentality cleanly, and that occurred here; it avoided becoming too syrupy and featured just enough emotion to make an impact. It also contained some great bits, like Bart and Lisa’s karaoke performance of the 'Theme from Shaft'. It also ended on a hilarious and incisive note." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was the sushi restaurant hostess's [...] "This is our karaoke bar. Now it is empty, but {{soon it will be}} hopping with drunken Japanese businessmen." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Again, a playful dig at racial stereotypes. Homer comes over as a <b>reasonable</b> <b>man</b> who wants to live his last day in style, and the closing twist is easily as good as the farewells leading up to it." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said that the episode is [...] "rich with sentimentality and Homer's expression of love for his family as he fears that his time is up." [...] He also commented that while all of the chalkboard gags on the show are [...] "funny", this episode [...] "features a true gem" [...] as Bart writes [...] "I will not cut corners" [...] once and then puts ditto marks below. Ed Potton of The Times wrote: [...] "The writers offer black humour by the bucketload, but the grim reality of Homer's fate is never in doubt; his eventual collapse is deeply affecting. A great example of [...] fierce satire being offset by a potent emotional core." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said {{the first half of the}} episode has [...] "fun skewering Japanese restaurants and such, while the second half is reasonably successful at emphasizing character while sustaining the comedy." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{point of}} the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, {{is not that it}} denies law {{enforcement}} the support of the usual inferences which <b>reasonable</b> <b>men</b> draw from evidence.

50|$|The {{court found}} that there was {{evidence}} before the jury on which <b>reasonable</b> <b>men</b> could properly have convicted, and therefore refused to interfere with the verdict.

2500|$|Judicial Commissioner Phang {{also thought}} that [...] "one {{ought not to}} draw a sharp {{distinction}} between the court's perspective ... {{and that of the}} public" [...] as both are [...] "integral parts of a holistic process". The practical reality in every case is that the court has to take into consideration the perspective of the public, and hence personifies the <b>reasonable</b> <b>man.</b> He cautioned that in deciding a case, a court has to focus on the substance and not be unduly distracted by the form of the terminology utilized. In applying either test, justice can be done and seen to be done if the court, personifying the <b>reasonable</b> <b>man,</b> takes a broad commonsense approach without inappropriately relying on special knowledge, the minutiae of court procedure or other matters outside the ken of the ordinary, reasonably well informed member of the public.|$|E
