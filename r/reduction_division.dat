50|$|One major {{impediment}} in breeding bananas is polyploidy; Gros Michel and Cavendish bananas are triploid {{and thus}} attempts at meiosis in the plant's ovules cannot produce a viable gamete. Only rarely does the first <b>reduction</b> <b>division</b> in meiosis in the plants' flowers tidily fail completely, {{resulting in a}} euploid triploid ovule, which can be fertilized by normal haploid pollen from a diploid banana variety; a whole stem of bananas would contain only a few seeds and sometimes none. As a result, the resulting new banana variety is tetraploid, and thus contains seeds, and the market for bananas is not accustomed to bananas with seeds.|$|E

The Waste <b>Reduction</b> <b>Division</b> (formerly Recycling and Sanitation) is responsible for the collection and disposal of residential recyclables, trash, and leaf and yard waste. The Division also holds hazardous waste drop-off days up to four times per year, seasonal paint and motor oil drop-offs, and offers discounted backyard compost bins. Boston has single-stream recycling. You can mix all recyclable materials together and place them on the curb for pickup on your recycling day. In addition, they collect and composts residents' leaf and yard waste on designated recycling days from April to the first week of December. Boston residents can also safely dispose of hazardous waste and shred unwanted documents for free on specific dates and events.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Both arrhenotokous and thelytokous {{reproduction}} {{are known}} {{to occur in the}} parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens. The cytological mechanism of thelytoky was previously reported to involve the formation of a restitution metaphase after the <b>reduction</b> <b>division,</b> but the exact nature of the subsequent divisions, whether reductional or equational, remained unclear. We reinvestigated the cytological mechanisms in a thelytokous strain collected in France. Our observations confirm previous results, but an equational and not a <b>reduction</b> <b>division</b> was observed after restitution. This type of reproduction can be classified as central fusion automictic parthenogenesis. In two arrhenotokous strains the normal pattern of oogenesis and syngamy of Hymenoptera was observed. In addition, we used PCR amplification to show that thelytoky in V. canescens is not caused by Wolbachia bacteria. The results are discussed in relation to maintenance of heterozygosity and female sex...|$|E

40|$|That {{mutations}} {{are accompanied}} by some change in the germ-plasm is, I take it, indisputable. Have we, however, any reason to suppose that the change takes place within the germ cells? I am not sure, {{as a matter of}} fact, that genetists in general regard the gametes as the place of origin of mutations. It is true, however, that experiments in the artificial production of mutations in plants have been limited largely to treatments of the ovaries from about the time of the <b>reduction</b> <b>division</b> to about the time of fertilization. This suggests a belief on the part of investigators that mutations {{are most likely to be}} induced in the gametes or in the stages of the plant closely associated with gamete formation.

(It is easily demonstrated in Uvularia that homologous ends of each chromosome are opposed, for the ends of the chromosomes differ in appearance.) This is confirmed by the formation of trivalents, quadiivalents, quinquevalents, etc., in triploid, tetraploid, and other plants with more than two homologous chormosomes; and also be the fact that none of the 12 chromosomes of the haploid Datura pair at the <b>reduction</b> <b>division</b> (Fig. 1).

Ultrastructural analysis of ceils undergoing reduction consistently revealed two duplexes of centrioles (one at each of two spindle poles) and two spindle poles in each cell that lacked centrioles but with microtubules terminating in a pericentriolar-like cloud of material.

The degree of heterozygosity is determined by the position of the chiasmata and the orientation of the chromosomes at metaphase II.

40|$|We have {{previously}} documented that transient polyploidy {{is a potential}} cell survival strategy underlying the clonogenic re-growth of tumour cells after genotoxic treatment. In an attempt to better define this mechanism, we recently documented the key role of meiotic genes in regulating the DNA repair and return of the endopolyploid tumour cells (ETC) to diploidy through <b>reduction</b> <b>divisions</b> after irradiation. Here, we studied {{the role of the}} pluripotency and self-renewal stem cell genes NANOG, OCT 4 and SOX 2 in this polyploidy-dependent survival mechanism. In irradiation-resistant p 53 -mutated lymphoma cell-lines (Namalwa and WI-L 2 -NS) but not sensitive p 53 wildtype counterparts (TK 6), low background expression of OCT 4 and NANOG was up-regulated by ionising radiation with protein accumulation evident in ETC as detected by OCT 4 /DNA flow cytometry and immunofluorescence (IF). IF analysis also showed that the ETC generate PML bodies that appear to concentrate OCT 4, NANOG and SOX 2 proteins, which extend into complex nuclear networks. These polyploid tumour cells resist apoptosis, overcome cellular senescence and undergo bi- and multi-polar divisions transmitting the up-regulated OCT 4, NANOG and SOX 2 self-renewal cassette to their descendents. Altogether, our observations indicate that irradiation-induced ETC up-regulate key components of germ-line cells, which potentially facilitate survival and propagation of the tumour cell population...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{begin to}} examine the {{function}} of the A-type cyclins during meiosis in the male, we have examined the developmental and cellular distribution of the cyclin A 1 and cyclin A 2 proteins, as well as their candidate cyclin-dependent kinase partners, Cdk 1 and Cdk 2, in the spermatogenic lineage. Immunohistochemical localization revealed that cyclin A 1 is present only in male germ cells just prior to or during the first, but not the second, meiotic division. By contrast, cyclin A 2 was expressed in spermatogonia and was most abundant in preleptotene spermatocytes, cells which will enter the meiotic pathway. Immunohistochemical detection of Cdk 1 was most apparent in early pachytene spermatocytes, while staining intensity diminished in diplotene and meiotically dividing spermatocytes, the cells in which cyclin A 1 expression was strongest. Cdk 2 was highly expressed in all spermatocytes. Notably, in cells undergoing the meiotic <b>reduction</b> <b>divisions,</b> Cdk 2 appeared to localize specifically to the chromatin. This was not the case for spermatogonia undergoing mitotic divisions. In the testis, cyclin A 1 has been shown to bind both Cdk 1 and Cdk 2 but we show here that cyclin A 2 binds only Cdk 2. These results indicate that the A-type cyclins and their associated kinases have different functions in the initiation and passage of male germ cells through meiosis...|$|R

No difference was observed between T. parva and T. annulata in these stages. For both Theileria species, the DNA measurements revealed that fusion of gametes occurred in the gut of the final host, thus providing evidence of sexual reproduction. However, differences were observed between the two parasites in the tick. Whereas T. parva zygotes underwent a two-step meiotic division, a comparable <b>reduction</b> <b>division</b> could not be unequivocally detected in T. annulata.

The significance of this nuclear differentiation and its possible similarity to nuclear structures reported in bacteria and an imperfect fungus are discussed. The cytoplasmic membrane appears first in the developing ascospore. The formation of an outer coat and an inner coat then follows.
