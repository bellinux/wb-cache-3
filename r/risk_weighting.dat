40|$|In September 2009, G 20 representatives {{called for}} {{introducing}} a minimum leverage ratio {{as an instrument}} of financial regulation. It is supposed to assure a certain degree of core capital for banks, independent of the controversial procedures used to assess risk. This paper discusses the interaction and tensions between the leverage ratio and risk-based capital requirements, using financial data of the Swiss systemically important bank UBS. It can be shown that the leverage ratio potentially undermines <b>risk</b> <b>weighting</b> such that banks feel encouraged to take greater risks. The paper proposes an alternative instrument that is conceived as a base risk weight and functions as a backstop. It ensures a minimum core capital ratio, based on unweighted total exposure by ensuring a minimum ratio of risk-weighted to total assets for all banks. The proposed measure is easy to compute like the leverage ratio, and also like the latter, it is independent of <b>risk</b> <b>weighting.</b> Yet, its primary advantage {{is that it does not}} supersede risk-based capital adequacy targets, but rather supplements them...|$|E

40|$|Banks use {{internal}} models to optimize <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> and better {{account for the}} specific risk of each asset class. As {{the choice of a}} set of <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> affects the regulatory capital ratio, economic theory suggests that banks should optimize their <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> accounting for the cost and benefit of holding equity capital. Banks with a higher cost of equity, and banks with better growth opportunities, should be more aggressive in reducing <b>risk</b> <b>weights.</b> We consider a large panel of international banks and find that, after controlling for a number of bank and country characteristics, a higher cost of equity and better growth opportunities have a negative relation with the ratio between risk-weighted assets and total assets and with the share of credit risk evaluated though {{internal models}}. The results are obtained in the context of endogeneity-robust econometric procedures and across several specifications.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two chapters {{on the effect of}} government policy and macroeconomics. Chapter 1 analyzes two aspects of post 1980 United States regulatory regime for commercial banks. Using FDIC historical and bank level data, it finds that <b>risk</b> <b>weighting</b> led to the industry holding more mortgages, mortgage securities, and derivatives while asset concentration is associated with the largest banks maintaining less capital, increased mortgaged lending during the housing boom, and large derivative positions. These findings suggest that allowing asset concentration and managing the risk of banks through <b>risk</b> <b>weighting</b> contributed to the Great Financial Crisis of 2007. Chapter 2 focuses on how the Great Inflation of the 1970 s caused a significant rise in household income taxes. As the tax brackets were not automatically indexed for inflation, average and marginal tax rates increased. Since households could expect that the tax brackets would be adjusted for inflation in the future and inflation was persistently high for several years there was an incentive for intertemporal labor substitution. I simulate a model to estimate the importance of this phenomenon and find that the shock can account for a significant amount of the fall of labor during both episodes of the Great Inflation. These results offer a possible reason for rising inflation and falling employment in the 1970 s and that institutional features such as sticky tax brackets can be important sources of monetary non-neutrality...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} <b>risk</b> <b>weighting</b> in the determination of minimum requirements for eligible bail-in-able liabilities of banks (MREL), i. e. liabilities that are not exempt from the bail-in tool in bank resolution {{and that can be}} written down or converted into equity if losses on assets exceed the available equity and such bailing-in is required to re-establish bank solvency so as to provide a basis for maintaining systemically important operations in resolution. The paper begins with a general discussion of the reasons for introducing bank resolution as a special procedure outside of insolvency law, of the reasons for having the bail-in tool and of the frictions that may {{stand in the way of}} successful and frictionless resolution. This discussion emphasizes the importance of having sufficient bail-in-able liabilities available; in contrast, for large institutions that have access to bond markets, the social costs of such requirements are small (unlike the private costs to the banks themselves). However, neither risk weighted nor total assets provide proper guidance for determining MREL. Risk-weighting suffers from a lack of a proper statistical basis and a certain manipulability. Moreover, the <b>risk</b> <b>weighting</b> that is used for capital regulation is not well suited for determining MREL; whereas capital regulation focuses on the probability of bad results, MREL is concerned with the extent of losses conditional on results being bad. "Total assets" suffer from not truly representing total assets because various rules, e. g. for netting, allow banks to keep certain assets and liabilities off their balance sheets...|$|E

As a result, the internal model approach does not necessarily provide capital savings relative to the standardized method that encourages the financial institutions to develop internal models. Whether the internal model approaches can provide capital savings depends on the characteristics of the portfolios of the financial institutions. The capital savings will occur only in the case of low-risk financial institutions.

The portfolios that we consider are invested in the 100 lowest risk stocks and apply equal weighting, market capitalization weighting, or inverse <b>risk</b> <b>weighting.</b> We find that the low-risk anomaly is also present when using high-frequency data, and for downside risk measures such as semivariance and Cornish-Fisher value at risk.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the VaRs for marketable assets {{in order to}} examine the propriety of the <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> set by the Basel Accord and compare the capital charges between the standardized and the internal model approaches using the actual positions of institutions.

Such “supervisory discrimination ” in terms of <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> gives rise to the moral hazard problem in that the regulator fails to reduce the risk-taking incentives of institutions. The internal model approach does not necessarily provide the capital savings to encourage the institutions to develop internal models.

However adequate disease surveillance can be labor-intensive and expensive and thus there is substantial motivation to conduct it as efficiently as possible. Surveillance is often based on the assumption of a simple random sample, but this can almost always be improved upon if there is auxiliary information available about disease risk factors. We present a Bayesian approach to disease surveillance when auxiliary risk information is available which will usually allow for substantial improvements over simple random sampling. Others have employed <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> in surveillance, but this can result in overly optimistic statements regarding freedom from disease due to not accounting for the uncertainty in the auxiliary information; our approach remedies this.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to measure the cyclicality of <b>risk</b> <b>weights,</b> calculated according to Basel II IRB approach, for SME corporate portfolio of one Nordic bank. Our main focus is to examine effects of both the loan allocation within the portfolio and the bank's rating system in calculating <b>risk</b> <b>weights,</b> and to estimate which of these effects predominates. In this paper an econometric model, a first-order autoregressive model, is designed to measure business cycle sensitivity of a rating system. The model measures sensitivity by estimating elasticities of default probabilities with respect to realised default rates. The analysis of default rates, based on the correlation of default rates and GDP is also carried out in order to measuse the rating system's sensitivity to the business cycle. In this paper we also simulate a fully sensitive to the business cycle system and a fairly neutral to the business cycle system in order to examine the effect of loan allocation and the effect of rating systems' sensitivity on <b>risk</b> <b>weights.</b> The main conclusion in this paper is that the countercyclical effect of loan reallocation within one particular bank's portfolio for corporates predominates the procyclical effect of changes in the borrowers' creditworthiness over the business cycle. Calculated <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> for this portfolio move in a countercyclical manner as a result of the bank's credit policy and the low business cycle sensitivity of the bank's rating system. The results show that the effect of loan allocation has a great impact even in the case with the simulated fully sensitive to the business cycle system. Another finding of this paper is that changes in the bank's credit policy are first and foremost applied on new borrowers, i. e. the bank sets higher thresholds for granting loans in economic downturns...|$|R
