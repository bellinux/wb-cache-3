5|$|Crane later becomes {{suspicious}} when {{he realizes}} the diagram made by Katrina he thought summoned the Horseman is <b>really</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> protection, {{and also that}} the corpse of Lady Van Tassel has a wound {{that seems to have}} been caused post-mortem. The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts in the Annales Piacentines the College of Cardinals {{was divided into}} adherents of Charles d'Anjou (pars Caroli) and the Imperial party (pars Imperii), but the exact reconstruction of these parties is very difficult. It is almost certain that this account is inaccurate when it claims that pars Caroli had six (or seven, in another place in that account) members, including Giovanni Gaetano Orsini and Ottobono Fieschi, while pars Imperii had eleven (or ten) members, Riccardo Annibaldi, Ottaviano Ubaldini and Uberto Coconati among them. Certainly five cardinals, namely Ottobono Fieschi, Guillame de Bray, Anchero Pantaleone, Simon Monpitie de Brie and Odo of Châteauroux belonged to the Angevin faction. But if Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was <b>really</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their leaders, then his relatives Matteo Orsini Rosso and Giacomo Savelli should also be added here, and since Henry of Segusio {{is also likely to}} have belonged to this faction, its true size would have amounted to nine cardinals. Imperial party, on the contrary, could not have had more than ten members, including two who had died during sede vacante.|$|E

500|$|Although some reviewers, {{including}} Yahr and TVLine Michael Slezak, were unenthusiastic about Blaine's {{visit to}} Burt {{to get him}} to have [...] "the talk" [...] with Kurt, there was widespread praise for the talk itself, which Jen Harper of BuddyTV described as the [...] "best scene" [...] of the episode. Fallon called it [...] "one of the most uncomfortable father–son sex talks ever committed to television (and thus, <b>really,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most realistic)", and his colleague Brown said it became [...] "something lovely, open-hearted, and true". Gonzalez deemed it awkward to watch, yet wrote that the scene served to convince her she had [...] "never loved a father-son pair" [...] more. Poniewozik found it realistic and moving, and gave particular praise to O'Malley for portraying Burt's [...] "determination and awkwardness in helping his son", as did Slezak: [...] "his completely grounded performance helps anchor the show in reality".|$|E
500|$|The {{crux of the}} issue, Bonds asserts, [...] "was never <b>really</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> style ... {{but rather}} of generic conception." [...] Between his Third and Seventh Symphonies, Beethoven had pushed the symphony well beyond the {{boundaries}} of entertainment into those of moral, political and philosophical statement. By adding text and voices in his Ninth Symphony, he not only redefined the genre but also called into question whether instrumental music could truly be superior to vocal music. The Ninth, Bonds says, in fact became the catalyst that fueled debate about the symphony genre. Hector Berlioz was the only composer [...] "able to grapple successfully with Beethoven's legacy." [...] However, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Niels Gade also achieved successes with their symphonies, putting at least a temporary stop to the debate as to whether the genre was dead. Regardless, composers increasingly turned to the [...] "more compact form" [...] of the concert overture [...] "as a vehicle within which to blend musical, narrative and pictoral ideas"; examples included Mendelssohn's overtures A Midsummer Night's Dream (1826) and The Hebrides (1830).|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by noted horror author Stephen King. King {{initially}} approached series co-star David Duchovny and {{informed him that}} he loved the show and desired to write an episode. Eventually, he called series creator Chris Carter and expressed his desire to write an episode of Millennium instead. Carter agreed, but once more, King {{changed his mind and}} it was decided that he would write an episode of The X-Files. King sent various drafts to Carter from his home in Maine; the two individuals never actually met one another. King's original story had some issues that Carter rewrote. Carter explained, [...] "Stephen wasn't used to writing for Mulder and Scully [...] the Mulder-and-Scully story in his original draft didn't quite work". Carter separated Mulder and Scully in the finalized draft and helped to finalize the script, hence their dual writing credit on the episode. Kim Manners, the director for the episode, later said, [...] "I was very excited to be able to direct a Stephen King piece, and when it was all said and done, there was very little Stephen King left in it. The nuts and bolts were his, but that was <b>really</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Chris' scripts." [...] Unbeknownst to either Carter or King, the word [...] "Chinga" [...] can be considered a vulgar Spanish colloquialism.|$|E

500|$|Interested in a directorial career, Affleck shadowed John Frankenheimer {{throughout}} pre-production of {{the action}} thriller Reindeer Games (2000). Frankenheimer, directing his last feature film, described Affleck as having [...] "a very winning, likable quality about him. I've {{been doing this for}} a long time and he's <b>really</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the nicest." [...] He starred opposite Charlize Theron as a hardened criminal, with Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times enjoying the unexpected casting choice: [...] "Affleck often suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent ... He looks as if he has never missed a party or a night's sleep. He's game, though, and his slight dislocation works to the advantage of Reindeer Games." [...] He then had a supporting role as a ruthless stockbroker in the crime drama Boiler Room (2000). A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck had [...] "traced over" [...] Alec Baldwin's performance in Glengarry Glen Ross, while Peter Rainer of New York Magazine said he [...] "does a series of riffs on Baldwin's aria, and each one is funnier and crueler than the next". He then provided the voice of Joseph in the animated [...] In his last film role of 2000, Affleck starred opposite his girlfriend Paltrow in the romantic drama Bounce. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the [...] "understated intensity and exquisite detail" [...] of his performance: [...] "His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined 'people person' who isn't half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1865, {{a review}} in The Times by E.S. Dallas lauded Our Mutual Friend as [...] "one {{of the best}} of even Dickens's tales," [...] but was unable to ignore the flaws. [...] "This last novel of Mr Charles Dickens, <b>really</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his finest works, and one in which on {{occasion}} he even surpasses himself, labours under the disadvantage of a beginning that drags ... On the whole, however, at that early stage the reader was more perplexed than pleased. There was an appearance of great effort without corresponding result. We were introduced to a set of people in whom it is impossible to take an interest, and were made familiar with transactions that suggested horror. The great master of fiction exhibited all his skill, performed the most wonderful feats of language, loaded his page with wit and many a fine touch peculiar to himself. The agility of his pen was amazing, but still at first we were not much amused." [...] Despite the mixed review, it pleased Dickens so well that he gave Dallas the manuscript.|$|E

[...] GameSpot's Ryan MacDonald scored both the Xbox and the GameCube versions 8 out of 10, calling it [...] "a traditional hack-and-slash action game that features great gameplay mechanics, stunning visuals, and lots of extras." [...] IGN's Hilary Goldstein scored it 7.6 out of 10, writing [...] "while The Two Towers is fun, it's not <b>really</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the better action games around. It does nothing new {{and there are a}} lot of problems that detract from the experience." [...] He was critical of the targeting system, the camera, the rigid linearity of each level and the inability to issue commands to AI controlled allies. He also wrote [...] "the Xbox version is inferior to the sharp and stunning quality of what was found on PS2. There's a ton of texture problems, poor contrast, and less detail than what's found on the PS2. That's not acceptable for a game coming out two months later and on a system that is easier to program for and can churn out incredible graphics with little effort." [...] GameSpy's David Hodgson scored it 3 out of 5, writing [...] "with the PlayStation 2 being all [...] "inferior" [...] to the Xbox's presumed power, and the two months of extra development time, surely E.A. must have added an extra aiming reticule for the archery, increased the frame rate from 30, sculpted a few more polygons on the main heroes and adversaries, and added reflections to the underwater orcs and other badly realized reflections. Well, don't bet on it, Bilbo. There are absolutely no differences between this, the GameCube, and the PlayStation 2 versions." ...|$|E
