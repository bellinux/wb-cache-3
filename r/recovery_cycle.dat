25|$|The {{properties}} of the nodal membrane largely determine the axon's strength-duration properties, and these will change with changes in membrane potential, with temperature, and with demyelination as the exposed membrane is effectively enlarged by the inclusion of paranodal and intermodal membrane. Thus, the strength-duration time constant {{is a reflection of}} persistent Na+ channel function, and is furthermore influenced by membrane potential and passive membrane properties. As such, many aspects of nerve excitability testing depend on sodium channel functions: namely, the strength-duration time constant, the <b>recovery</b> <b>cycle,</b> the stimulus-response curve, and the current-threshold relationship. Measuring responses in nerve that are related to nodal function (including strength-duration time constant and rheobase) and internodal function has allowed insight into normal axon physiology as well as normal fluctuations of electrolyte concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Highwall mining {{is another}} form of surface mining that evolved from auger mining. In Highwall mining, the coal seam is {{penetrated}} by a continuous miner propelled by a hydraulic Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM). A typical cycle includes sumping (launch-pushing forward) and shearing (raising and lowering the cutterhead boom to cut the entire height of the coal seam). As the coal <b>recovery</b> <b>cycle</b> continues, the cutterhead is progressively launched into the coal seam for 19.72 feet (6.01 m). Then, the Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM) automatically inserts a 19.72-foot (6.01 m) long rectangular Pushbeam (Screw-Conveyor Segment) into the center section of the machine between the Powerhead and the cutterhead. The Pushbeam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) into the coal seam. One patented Highwall mining system uses augers enclosed inside the Pushbeam that prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the conveyance process. Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor (CID), the operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the continuous miner's progress. Highwall mining can produce {{thousands of tons of}} coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas, trench mine applications and steep-dip seams with controlled water-inflow pump system and/or a gas (inert) venting system.|$|E

25|$|Nerve excitability {{examination}} complements conventional nerve conduction {{studies by}} allowing insight into biophysical characteristics of axons, {{as well as}} their ion-channel functioning. The protocol is aimed at providing information about nodal as well as internodal ion channels, and the indices are extremely sensitive to axon membrane potential. These studies have provided insight into conditions characterized by changes in resting potential, such as electrolyte concentration and pH, as well as specific ion-channel and pump function in normal and diseased nerves. Furthermore, software programs enabling the calculation of rheobasic and time constant values from both normal and diseased nerves have recently enabled researchers to pinpoint some important factors for a number of pervasive nerve disorders, many of which involve substantial demyelination (see Clinical Significance). Supraximal electrical stimulation and measurement of conduction velocity and amplitudes of compound motor (CMAP) and sensory (SNAP) responses provide measures of the number and conduction velocities of large myelinated fibers. Additionally, multiple measures of excitability in the TROND protocol permit assessment of ion channels (transient and persistent Na+ channels, slow K+ channels) at nodes of Ranvier by computing stimulus response curves, strength duration time constant (chronaxie), rheobase, and the <b>recovery</b> <b>cycle</b> after passage of an action potential. This is accomplished by applying long polarizing currents to the nerve and measuring the influence of voltage on voltage gated-ion channels beneath myelin.|$|E

The internodally focally demyelinated cases (termed as IFD 1, IFD 2 and IFD 3, respectively) are simulated using our previous double cable model of the fibres. The results show that the intracellular potentials are with reduced amplitude and slowed conduction velocity in the vicinity of demyelinated segments, however the segmental conduction block is not achieved. The radial decline of the extracellular potential amplitudes slightly increases with the increase of the radial distance and demyelination. In contrast, the electrotonic potentials, strength-duration time constants and rheobases are normal.

The new design sought to optimize heat recovery from a gas turbine engine exhaust as well as assist with flow turning through a bend in the exhaust duct in order to minimize back-pressure increases. The analysis of the design was based around the use of the Allison 250 gas turbine engine. An analysis of the engine was performed to determine baseline operating parameters to be used in ANSYS CFD models.

40|$|Mechanosensory afferent units {{consist of}} a parent axon, the {{peripheral}} axonal arborization, and the branch terminal mechanoreceptors. The present work uses a mathematical model to describe the contribution of a given number of rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors to the impulse pattern of their parent axon. In the model impulses initiated by any driven mechanoreceptor instantaneously propagate orthodromically and antidromically. The model also incorporates the axonal absolute refractory period as well as ortho-and antidromically elicited <b>recovery</b> <b>cycles.</b> In separate computations, periodic or random (Poisson process) trains of short-duration stimuli at constant amplitude are delivered to a given number (N= 2 – 30) of co-innervated mechanoreceptors. The superposition of component impulse trains always departs from the theoretical ideal (Poisson process). Such departures are attributable to: (i) the number of driven mechanoreceptors, when N is small, (ii) axonal absolute refractory period, during maximal amplitude stimulation, and (iii) antidromic <b>recovery</b> <b>cycles</b> as well as absolute refractoriness, during submaximal-amplitude stimulation. Computations reveal that this “instantaneous reset” model results in the elimination of information extracted by driven mechanoreceptors.
