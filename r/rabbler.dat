5000|$|More fuel is {{then added}} and the {{temperature}} raised. The iron completely melts and the carbon starts to burn off as well. When wet puddling, the formation of carbon dioxide due to reactions with the added iron oxide will cause bubbles to form that cause the mass to appear to boil. This process causes the slag to puff up on top, giving the <b>rabbler</b> a visual indication of {{the progress of the}} combustion. As the carbon burns off, the melting temperature of the mixture rises from 1150 to 1540 C, so the furnace has to be continually fed during this process. The melting point increases since the carbon atoms within the mixture act as a solute in solution which lowers the melting point of the iron mixture (like road salt on ice). Burning them off causes the melting point to increase towards that of pure iron, and since the temperature of the puddling furnace is less than that which wrought iron melts, decarburized iron in the mixture start to solidify around the puddling bars. Eventually the carbon is mostly burned off and the iron [...] "comes to nature", forming into a spherical spongy mass, indicating that the process is complete and the material can be removed. The hook {{on the end of the}} bar is then used to pull out the large puddle balls of the material, about 35 - 40 kg each, and 30 - 38 cm in diameter. Sometimes a large pair of tongs are used to remove the puddle balls.|$|E

The <b>Rabble</b> went on tour in the UK and Europe from August 2009 to January 2010 [...] as well as writing and recording for their next album. They recorded at York Street studios in Auckland early in 2008 , and the bass and guitars were tracked at Number 8 wire Recording studio, by Chazz <b>Rabble..</b> In April 2010, they were in line-up at Punk & Disorderly Festival in Berlin. On 1 August 2011, The <b>Rabble</b> released an album that was long-awaited by anxious fans titled, [...] "Life's A Journey". They were the second band to be announced for Rebellion Festival 2013 along with California punk band Left Alone after their successful show at Rebellion in 2009. They were joined by controversial act, The Casualties and Scottish punk act, The Exploited. In the Early demos they had more of a punk-core records street punk {{as opposed to the}} recent pop rock sound they adopted. the Lyrics were sometimes in English and some times in Malay due to the original vocalist's (Ben) mother tongue of Malaysian. They also played along an Auckland-based Thai street punk band known as chaos city who at one point played for the <b>Rabble</b> and Auckland city Legends missing Teeth and the Rudies and made their name in the under ground Necropolis venue {{on the outskirts of the}} Auckland CBD.They have mixed reactions and reviews in the New Zealand punk scene, some love them and others hate them, having been criticized for being 'sell outs' by 'puritanical' 'punk's it could be argued that they never 'bought in' in the first place and used the underground as a stepping stone.
