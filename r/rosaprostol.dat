40|$|Four enantiomerically pure {{stereoisomers}} of <b>rosaprostol</b> (1), an antiulcer drug, were efficiently synthesized {{from the}} enantiomers of 2 -(dimethoxyphosphoryl) - 3 -hexylcyclopentanone (3) as chiral substrates. The latter {{were obtained by}} resolution of racemic 3 with (+) -(R) - 1 -(1 -naphthyl) ethylamine. The conversion of (+) - 3 into <b>rosaprostol</b> stereoisomer (−) - 1 a was accomplished in four steps in 56 % overall yield. According to the same protocol, the second stereoisomer (+) - 1 c was obtained from (−) - 3 in 55 % overall yield. A slightly improved procedure {{of the last two}} steps of the transformation of (+) - 3 into (−) - 1 a allowed an increase in the overall yield to 64 %. The remaining two stereoisomers, (−) - 1 b and (+) - 1 d, were obtained from (−) - 1 a and (+) - 1 c in 71 and 68 % yield, respectively, by a two-reaction sequence, in which a Mitsunobu inversion of configuration at C- 5 was the key step...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This account {{outlines}} {{the results obtained}} in the author’s laboratory on the application of phosphonate reagents in the synthesis of biologically active cyclopentanones and cyclopentenones. The synthesis and reactivity of 3 -phosphorylmethyl-cycloalkenones is discussed as a platform for developing the first synthesis of enantiomeric isoterreins {{as well as the}} synthesis of racemic and optically active prostaglandins B 1 a. A different strategy for the total synthesis of racemic and enantiomeric forms of sarkomycin and <b>rosaprostol</b> is described which involves in a key step intramolecular carbenoid cyclization of the corresponding a-diazo-b-ketophosphonates...|$|E
