5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} the passive warning {{markings}} or not), such as a <b>Red</b> Cross, <b>Red</b> Crescent or <b>Red</b> Crystal (collective known as the Protective Symbols). These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national <b>Red</b> Cross or <b>Red</b> Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the <b>Red</b> Cross member organization use a <b>red</b> Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the <b>Red</b> Crystal.|$|E

5|$|At {{least two}} livery {{variants}} were tested on scale models, which were later exposed at VR's conference centre at Helsinki central railway station: {{one has a}} <b>red</b> strip for the whole length of the train, with the window backgrounds painted grey. The other is more similar to the final result, but {{the front of the}} train includes more <b>red</b> and no grey paint at all. VR finally settled to a combination of both of them, which bore resemblance to the company's InterCity livery. The bottom of the carriages is dark grey, with a <b>red</b> stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. The top of the carriages is painted grey. <b>Red</b> colouring {{at the end of each}} car forms <b>red</b> parallelograms when the carriages are combined.

In the Zunyi Conference, Zhu supported Mao Zedong’s criticisms of Bo and Braun. After the conference, Zhu cooperated with Mao and Zhou on military affairs. In July 1935 Zhu and Liu Bocheng were with the Fourth <b>Red</b> Army while Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with the First <b>Red</b> Army. When separation between the two divisions occurred, Zhu was forced by Zhang Guotao, the leader of Fourth <b>Red</b> Army, to go south.

5|$|F.C. United's club colours are <b>red,</b> {{white and}} black—the same colours worn by Manchester United. The shirt bears no {{sponsorship}} logo, {{as it was}} written into the club's constitution that the club should not have a shirt sponsor. The club's first kit was a plain <b>red</b> shirt, white shorts and plain black socks. The club introduced a new home shirt for the 2007–08 season with a striped collar and striped ends on the sleeves which lasted until 2009. This was changed for the 2009–11 seasons to a <b>red</b> shirt with {{a black and white}} stripe down the left side, manufactured by Admiral Sportswear. For seasons 2011–13 the club reverted to a plain <b>red</b> shirt, manufactured by O'Neills. The club's second kit, worn when playing away against a team with a predominantly <b>red</b> kit, is a white shirt with a horizontal <b>red</b> and black wave, white shorts and socks. The club has an alternative plain blue kit for playing against a team with a <b>red</b> and white kit. In past seasons white shirts with diagonal black or <b>red</b> stripes and a white shirt with a <b>red</b> trim, black shorts and white socks have all been used as the second kits.|$|E

In addition, the movement dispatched 3,000 workers and three disaster response teams to affected areas for search and rescue missions, damage assessments, and assistance to people affected by the typhoon. The Philippine <b>Red</b> Cross provided canned goods, rice, clothing, and personal hygiene items to over 6,300 families, and local volunteers provided assistance to people in shelters.

Striped hyenas prey on golden jackals, and three jackal carcasses were found in one hyena den.|$|E
5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and <b>red</b> were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and <b>red</b> gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. <b>Red</b> was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for <b>red.</b> Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite <b>red.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Harry Frazee {{purchased}} the <b>Red</b> Sox, on credit, for $500,000. Despite Ruth's {{success with the}} <b>Red</b> Sox, owner and Broadway producer Frazee lost his patience with Ruth, who had threatened to hold out {{in lieu of a}} larger contract and become a distraction. After the <b>Red</b> Sox finished sixth in the American League in 1919, Frazee, needing money to finance a Broadway musical, No, No Nanette, sold pitcher-turned-outfielder Babe Ruth to the Yankees. Frazee received $125,000 and a loan of $300,000—secured on Fenway Park, the <b>Red</b> Sox' home stadium—for Ruth, despite Ruth having set the record for home runs with 29 in 1919. This began a series of deals with the Yankees that resulted in a long period of mediocrity for the <b>Red</b> Sox while the Yankees began their dynasty.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, the British {{ecologist}} Anthony S. Cheke {{proposed that}} the last two types mentioned were male and female Newton's parakeets, and that the differences between them were due to sexual dimorphism. The last bird mentioned had earlier been identified as introduced grey-headed lovebirds (Agapornis canus) by A. Newton, but Cheke did not find this likely, as their beaks are grey. Alexandre Pingré also mentioned green birds, perhaps with some <b>red</b> colours, but his account is partially unintelligible and therefore ambiguous. A <b>red</b> shoulder patch is also present on the related Alexandrine parakeet. None of the existing Newton's parakeet specimens have <b>red</b> patches. The single known male specimen may have been immature, judged on the colour of its beak, and this may also explain {{the absence of the}} <b>red</b> patch. When Psittacula are bred by aviculturalists, blue is easily produced from green; the production of blue may suppress <b>red</b> colouration, so blue morphs may have lacked the <b>red</b> patch.|$|E

5|$|In Eurasia, <b>red</b> foxes may be preyed upon by leopards, caracals and Eurasian lynxes. The lynxes chase <b>red</b> foxes {{into deep}} snow, where their longer legs and larger paws {{give them an}} {{advantage}} over foxes, especially when {{the depth of the}} snow exceeds one metre. In the Velikoluki district in Russia, <b>red</b> foxes are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to <b>red</b> foxes than wolves do. North American felid predators of <b>red</b> foxes include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young foxes, while golden eagles have been known to kill adults.|$|E
