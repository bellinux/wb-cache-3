40|$|The Personal Data Protection Act {{was enacted}} in 1997; it imposed some {{obligations}} {{on all the}} administrators of personal data regardless if acting as private or public establishments. The Act was intended to guarantee the safety of personal data and to ensure the right to controlling the data processing. However, since the enacting of the Act, there have been <b>reported</b> instances <b>of</b> its <b>infringement,</b> especially by private entrepreneurs. The numerous appealed complaints show that the entrepreneurs neglect their duty of ensuring the safety of personal data (e. g. documents or media with such personal data), which results in unauthorised revealing the data to third parties. An especially serious case <b>of</b> the <b>infringements</b> <b>of</b> the Act {{and the rights of}} the persons concerned is selling the data without a person’s consent. In many cases the administrator only seemingly informs about the purposes of processing the data and then, in this or any other insidious way (among them an inacceptable presumption of consent), beguiles the necessary acceptance. The occurrences of neglecting duties imposed by the Act are to be considered not only as <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> law, but also as unethical actions resulting in undermining customers’ confidence in entrepreneurs. For example: The unprotected data can be viewed and used by unauthorised parties {{to the detriment of the}} persons concerned (e. g. identity theft). The selling of the data is also a source of an unjustifiable profit for an entrepreneur and makes controlling of the processing of personal data impossible. Even if there are no negative consequences for the customer, the cases <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> the Personal Data Protection Act bring about to undermine confidence not only in the entrepreneur (the source of personal data) but also in private establishments in general...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Computer Forensics is a {{research}} area that finds the malicious users by collecting and analyzing the intrusion or <b>infringement</b> evidence <b>of</b> computer crimes such as hacking. Many researches about Computer Forensics have been done so far. But those researches have focused on how to collect the forensic evidence for both analysis and proofs after receiving the intrusion or <b>infringement</b> <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> hosts from computer users or network administrators. In this paper, we describe how to selectively collect the forensic evidence of good quality from observable and protective hosts at the time <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> occurrence by malicious users. By correlating the event logs of Intrusion Detection Systems(IDSes) and hosts with the configuration information of hosts periodically, we calculate the value <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> severity that implies the real <b>infringement</b> possibility <b>of</b> the hosts. Based on this severity value, we selectively collect the evidence for proofs at the time <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> occurrence. As a result, we show that we can minimize the information damage of the evidence for both analysis and proofs, and {{reduce the amount of}} data which are used to analyze the degree <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> severity. ...|$|R

To address these issues, we present VisiOn Privacy Platform which provides holistic privacy management throughout the whole information system lifecycle. It contains a privacy aware process that is supported by a software platform and enables Data Controllers to ensure privacy and Data Subjects to gain control of their data, by participating in the privacy policy formulation.

It aims to analyze the offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. In the introduction the document compares unfair competition within the parameters of civil and criminal law. The following chapters examine in detail the criminal offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and further, separate chapters are devoted to specific facts of unfair competition. An additional goal of this thesis is the introduction and brief analysis of other offenses that may qualify as unfair competition, and compare them with the offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Not only due to the possibility of criminal sanctions for unfair competition when all of the elements of the criminal offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code are not completely fulfilled, but also because of a possible single concurrent act with this offense.
