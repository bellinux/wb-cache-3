40|$|Maintenance or nafqat is {{the plural}} {{for the word}} nafaqah. It means {{something}} which is given by a person of which he himself requires and needed by another consisting of food, drinks and others. These may also include clothing and lodging. Under Islamic law, {{it is incumbent upon}} family members to maintain each other mutually. The rule being that one party is in need while the other has the means to offer aid. A father, for instance, is to provide for his children, Equally, children are also to maintain their indigent parents. However, not much has been deliberated upon the right of a grandparent to receive support from his grandchild and vice versa, in Malaysia. Little is made known to the masses that a sibling is required to provide for a needy sibling, an uncle has a similar obligation towards a poor nephew and so forth. The right to be supported, however, does not include every family member for this is certainly impracticable and burdensome. Distant relatives therefore are naturally excluded. Difference of religion will also affect the right to receive support and it is also dependent on the closeness of one’s relationship to the provider. Still, jurists hold different views on the said matters. This article therefore will look into the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>grandparents,</b> grandchildren and other relatives to acquire maintenance under the different schools of Islamic law. Reference will also be made to the Islamic Family Law (Federal Territories) Act 1984, hereinafter referred to as Act 303 in discussing the law in Malaysia as the provision in the said Act relating to maintenance of relatives is similar to the provision in the other state...|$|E

40|$|Background: Increasingly, U. S. {{grandparents}} {{are raising}} their grandchildren. In Hawai‘i, 12 % <b>of</b> Native Hawaiian <b>grandparents</b> live with grandchildren, compared to 7 % <b>of</b> <b>grandparents</b> in all races combined in the state, and to 3. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>grandparents</b> {{in the total}} U. S. Although strong family-centric cultural values may provide Native Hawaiian grandparents with caregiving benefits, a generally poor health profile suggests they may also face challenges in this role. In this study, we talked to Native Hawaiian grandparents raising grandchildren (GRG) about the benefits and challenges of their caregiving experiences. Method: Three focus groups were conducted with Native Hawaiian grandparents (n= 33) in Hawai‘i who were 55 {{years of age or}} older and caregivers to their grandchildren. Findings: The most prevalent themes voiced by <b>grandparents</b> spoke <b>of</b> the benefits <b>of</b> being a <b>grandparent</b> caregiver (the greatest being the experience of mutual, unconditional love) and the enjoyment of passing on “life lessons” to their grandchildren. Grandparents identified concrete examples of what they provided to grandchildren and also spoke of their role in transmission of Native Hawaiian cultural values, practices, and stories to their grandchildren. A number of challenges pertaining to grandparent caregiving were identified along with needed services—respite care, financial assistance, children’s programs, and information on grandparent legal rights. Despite these challenges, grandparents preferred to seek help from extended family rather than from formal supports. Our results support previous research on a number of universal GRG needs and services (i. e., legal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> GRG) but also suggest potential directions to meeting the needs of Native Hawaiian GRG that are responsive to indigenous cultural values and preferences. Given the number of unmet needs expressed, {{further research is needed to}} design interventions for this population <b>of</b> <b>grandparents</b> raising grandchildren...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: As our {{knowledge}} about the experiences <b>of</b> <b>grandparents</b> when their grandchild has a disability is extremely limited, {{the purpose of this}} research was to explore the emotional journey <b>of</b> Australian <b>grandparents.</b> Method: This qualitative research utilised purposive sampling and semi-structured in-depth interviews to explore the experiences <b>of</b> 22 Australian <b>grandparents,</b> whose grandchild had been diagnosed with a disability. Results: Three key themes characterised grandparent’s emotional journey: Adjusting (the transition from anger to acceptance), The ‘Double Grief’ (sadness about what might have been for both their child and grandchild) and Pride in Family (pride in family’s ability to adjust to the challenges of the situation). Conclusion: As the first Australian study to explore the experiences <b>of</b> <b>grandparents</b> when their grandchild has a disability, the research provides important new {{knowledge about the}} emotional journey for grandparents. Unlike overseas research, Australian grandparents view themselves as being there to support their own children, rather than ‘holding the family together’.

This project’s overall aim involves two interrelated issues: (1) what grandparenting looks like across selected European countries – including the diversity <b>of</b> <b>grandparents,</b> the families they care for, and the intensity and type of care that they provide, and (2) how family policies in different countries are specifically related to these varying patterns.

Those <b>grandparents</b> raising grand-children demonstrating neurological, physical, emotional, or behavioral problems exhibited the most distress, the most disruption of roles, and the most deteriorated grandparent-grandchild relationships. Although custodial grandparents raising apparently normal grandchildren demonstrated less distress, less disruption of roles, and less deterioration of the grandparent-grandchild relationship than those grandparents raising grandchildren dis-playing problems, in these respects, they still demonstrated higher such levels than did traditional grandparents. Contemporary society now reflects new family structures, and consequently, unique patterns of interaction among family members which {{differ from those of}} the nuclear family of procreation have emerged. In this context, increasing numbers <b>of</b> <b>grandparents</b> have been confronted with unconventional care-giving situations, and many may be left ill-prepared to take on the redefined role <b>of</b> <b>grandparent.</b> In view <b>of</b> the ambiguity of the role <b>of</b> <b>grandparent</b> in general (Rosow, 1985), an increasingly common form <b>of</b> nontraditional <b>grandparenting,</b> custodial, grandparenting, has emerged (see Emick & Hayslip...|$|R

Methods: The study used quantitative methods with correlational design. Measuring devices were the scale of psychological well being and the role <b>of</b> <b>grandparent.</b> This research involved 108 elderly from Semarang, Jepara and Kendal, obtained through a quota-purposive sampling technique. Quantitative data analysis was based on simple regression analysis. Results: The study results in rxy = 0. 397, p = 0. 000 (p < 0. 05), which indicates a positive and significant correlation between the role <b>of</b> <b>grandparent</b> and psychological well-being of the elderly.
