40|$|We present initial {{results from}} testing a new {{remote sensing system}} called the Active Temperature, Ozone and Moisture Microwave Spectrometer (ATOMMS). ATOMMS is {{designed}} as a satellite-to-satellite occultation system for monitoring climate. We are developing the prototype instrument for an aircraft to aircraft occultation demonstration. Here we focus on field testing of the ATOMMS instrument, in particular the remote sensing of water by measuring the attenuation caused by the 22 GHz and 183 GHz water absorption lines. Our measurements of the 183 GHz line spectrum along an 820 m path revealed that the AM 6. 2 spectroscopic model provdes a much better match to the observed spectrum than the MPM 93 model. These comparisons also indicate that errors in the ATOMMS amplitude measurements are about 0. 3 %. Pressure sensitivity bodes well for ATOMMS as a climate instrument. Comparisons with a hygrometer revealed consistency at the 0. 05 mb level, which is about 1 % of the absolute humidity. Initial measurements of absorption by the 22 GHz line made along a 5. 4 km path between two mountaintops captured a large increase in water vapor similar to that measured by several nearby hygrometers. A storm passage between the two instruments yielded our first measurements of extinction by rain and cloud droplets. Comparisons of ATOMMS 1. 5 mm opacity measurements with measured visible opacity and backscatter from a weather radar revealed features simultaneously evident in all three datasets confirming the ATOMMS measurements. The combined ATOMMS, <b>radar</b> <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> information revealed the evolution of rain and cloud amounts along the signal path during {{the passage of the}} storm. The derived average cloud water content reached typical continental cloud amounts.

40|$|The {{surface of}} Titan has been {{revealed}} by Cassini observations {{in the infrared}} and radar wavelength ranges as well as locally by the Huygens lander instruments. Sand seas, recently discovered lakes, distinct landscapes and dendritic erosion patterns indicate dynamic surface processes. This study focus on erosional and depositional features {{that can be used}} to constrain the amount of liquids involved in the erosional process as well as on the compositional characteristics of depositional areas. Fluvial erosion channels on Titan as identified at the Huygens landing site and in <b>RADAR</b> <b>and</b> <b>Visible</b> and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) observations have been compared to analogous channel widths on Earth yielding average discharges of up to 1600 m 3 /s for short recurrence intervals that are sufficient to move centimeter-sized sediment and significantly higher discharges for long intervals. With respect to the associated drainage areas, this roughly translates to 1 – 150 cm/day runoff production rates with 10 years recurrence intervals and by assuming precipitation this implies 0. 6 – 60 mm/h rainfall rates. Thus the observed surface erosion fits with the methane convective storm models as well as with the rates needed to transport sediment. During Cassini's T 20 fly-by, the VIMS observed an extremely eroded area at 30 ° W, 7 ° S with resolutions of up to 500 m/pixel that extends over thousands of square kilometers. The spectral characteristics of this area change systematically, reflecting continuous compositional and/or particle size variations indicative of transported sediment settling out while flow capacities cease. To account for the estimated runoff production and widespread alluvial deposits of fine-grained material, release of area-dependent large fluid volumes are required. Only frequent storms with heavy rainfall or cryovolcanic induced melting can explain these erosional features...|$|E
40|$|As {{remote sensing}} systems {{begin to make}} radar imagery more available, it becomes {{increasingly}} important to realize and exploit the full information content of the media. The goals of this investigation are threefold: (1) to assess the applicability of commonly used image manipulation tools to radar imagery, (2) to investigate and the quantify the added value brought to the classification problem by radar imagery, and (3) to investigate the value of local spatial features, derived from a radar image, in the classification undertaking. ^ The first portion of the study investigates the statistical properties of <b>radar</b> <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> image data. Three different digital radar data sets are examined and their autocorrelation functions computed. The autocorrelation functions {{are found to be}} substantially lower than those of visible images. The effects of resampling on imagery with this lower correlation coefficient are found to be more severe than for visible imagery. The implication of these findings on information extraction from radar images is that spatial properties, which contribute a significant amount of information to classification success, are diminished. ^ In the second and most significant portion of the investigation, the relative abilities of visible texture measures and radar roughness measures to separate bare fields of different roughnesses are examined. The visible photographs and multi-frequency multi-angle multi-polarization microwave data set were acquired by the University of Kansas in 1975. Some 104 textural features, including co-occurrence, Fourier transform, differences-of-averages, gray level run lengths, autocorrelation and Mitchell 2 ̆ 7 s max-min measures, were used in the classification of digital segments of the visible images. A proposed set of 390 microwave roughness features including models from inverse scattering theory as well as heuristic measures, were extracted from the microwave data set. Feature success was determined through the combined use of Fisher and Bhattacharyya distances. The single-feature results indicate that the microwave features are superior in differentiating the field roughnesses. However, for higher dimensionalities the benefit of the combined use of microwave and visible features is indicated. ^ The third portion of the investigation compares the relative abilities of spectral and textural features applied to visible and radar images of the same areas on the ground, acquired from aircraft and satellite altitudes, to identify specific ground materials. In the low altitude aircraft comparison, the radar textural features were the best performers in a classification experiment while the visible spectral values offered the least separability. For the higher altitude data, the visible texture features provided the superior performance. ^ General conclusions are as follows: (1) The simultaneous use of visible and microwave sensors offers an alternative to researchers in the artificial intelligence and remote sensing communities who are attempting to duplicate human perception and recognition (Scene understanding). (2) The information value of a number of simple features has been demonstrated. (3) The information value of spatial features applied to radar imagery {{has been shown to be}} diminished through the resampling process. (4) A systematic method of feature evaluation has been demonstrated for comparing the value of large numbers of features of different wavelengths. ...|$|E

Geomorphic processes affecting alluvial fans in the two areas include aeolian deposition, desert varnish, and fluvial dissection. However, salt weathering is a much more important process in the Kun Lun than in the southwestern United States. This slows the formation of desert varnish and prevents desert pavement from forming. Thus the Kun Lun signatures are characteristic of the dominance of salt weathering, while signatures from the southwestern United States are characteristic of the dominance of desert varnish and pavement processes.

Many [1, 9, 15] have shown these permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) may trap water ice for geologic time periods inside cold-traps. More recently, direct {{evidence for the}} presence of water ice deposits inside craters was remotely sensed in <b>RADAR</b> [5] <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> imagery [3]. Albedo measurements (reflectence at 1064 nm) obtained by the MErcury Space ENviroment GEochemistry and Ranging Laser Altimeter (MLA) found unusually bright and dark areas next to Mercury's north pole [7]. Using a thermal illumination model, Paige et al. [8] found the bright deposits are correlated with surface cold-traps, and the dark deposits are correlated with subsurface cold-traps. They suggested these anomalous deposits were brought to the surface by comets and were processed by the magnetospheric radiation flux, removing hydrogen and mixing C-N-O-S atoms to form a variety of molecules which will darken with time. Here we use a thermal illumination model to find the link between the cold-trap area fraction of a rough surface and its albedo. Using this link and the measurements obtained by MESSENGER we derive a surface and a subsurface ice distribution map on Mercury's north pole below the MESSENGER spatial resolution, approximately 500 m.

In this paper, we develop and validate a fast simulator that provides estimates of the cloud OCP given a vertical profile of optical extinction. We use a pressure-weighting scheme where the weights depend upon optical parameters of clouds and/or aerosol. A cloud weighting function is easily extracted using this formulation. We then use the fast simulator to compare two different satellite cloud OCP retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) with estimates based on collocated cloud extinction profiles from a combination of CloudSat <b>radar</b> <b>and</b> MODIS <b>visible</b> radiance data.
