5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle changed the {{perception}} of the rebel movement in Mexico. Before Madero's victory many believed that the <b>rebel</b> <b>forces</b> would scatter {{as soon as they were}} confronted by federal troops. The fall of Juárez proved that notion wrong and revealed the real strength of the <b>rebel</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the peasants' arsenals, Egypt's military possessed modern arms and artillery. The use of cannons on open battlefields in particular inflicted heavy losses on the rebels. Egypt's army also possessed considerable organization {{in contrast to the}} lack of military coordination between <b>rebel</b> <b>forces</b> in different regions.|$|E
5|$|From 1420 to 1644, the Forbidden City was {{the seat}} of the Ming dynasty.

He soon fled before the combined armies of former Ming general Wu Sangui and Manchu forces, setting fire to parts of the Forbidden City in the process.|$|E
50|$|Throughout 1915, 1916 and 1917, Andreu Almazán {{operated}} {{in the area}} of Guerrero, Puebla and Oaxaca, primarily as an independent <b>rebel</b> <b>force,</b> yet putting out public pronouncements that he supported either Zapata or Díaz. In early 1918 he changed his base of operations to northeast Mexico, as a <b>rebel</b> <b>force</b> supporting Felix Díaz.|$|R

The Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 impacted on the hall, which {{was close to the}} Scottish border. In 1715, William Wybergh, the owner, was abducted by Scottish soldiers, and in 1745, shortly before the Clifton Moor Skirmish, it was occupied and looted by the <b>rebel</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E

5|$|Navarro, for his part, {{pressured}} by Madero, {{tried to keep}} the ceasefire {{for as long as he}} could. This proved to be quite costly to the defenders. The <b>rebel</b> <b>forces</b> captured the outer defenses of the city unopposed, as no federal officer was willing to countermand the orders to hold fire. Instead, the troops withdrew deeper into the city.|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt was a {{rebellion}} against Egyptian conscription and taxation policies in Palestine. It was a collective {{reaction to the}} gradual elimination of the unofficial rights and privileges previously enjoyed by the various societal groups in the region under Ottoman rule. While the local peasantry constituted {{the bulk of the}} <b>rebel</b> <b>forces,</b> urban notables and Bedouin tribes also formed {{an integral part of the}} revolt.|$|E
5|$|With {{the support}} of an entire legion, other legionnaires, {{prompted}} by discontent over pay, deserted Macrinus and joined Elagabalus' ranks as well. In response to the growing threat, Macrinus sent out a cavalry force {{under the command of}} Ulpius Julianus to try and regain control of the rebel soldiers. Rather than capturing the <b>rebel</b> <b>forces,</b> the cavalry instead killed Ulpius and defected to Elagabalus.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the rebels}} were {{defeated}} in Surabaya, <b>rebel</b> <b>forces</b> campaigning {{in the interior}} of Central and East Java had more success. The rebel campaign culminated in the fall of the capital Plered in June 1677. The king was ill, and distrust among the royal princes prevented organized resistance. The king fled west with the crown prince and his retinue, allowing the rebels to enter and plunder the capital with little fighting. The rebels then withdrew to Kediri, taking the royal treasury with them.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>rebel</b> <b>forces</b> {{advanced}} {{towards his}} enemy's line, Alexios's flankers sprung their ambush. Their attack did indeed cause some initial confusion, but Bryennios (or, {{according to the}} Alexiad, his brother John, who commanded the right wing) rallied his men and led forth the second line. This counter-attack broke Alexios's flankers; as they retreated in panic, they fell upon the Immortals, who also panicked and fled, abandoning their posts. Although they suffered some casualties from Bryennios's pursuing men, most managed to escape well {{to the rear of}} Alexios's army.|$|E
5|$|Historian of Indonesia M. C. Ricklefs {{argued that}} the VOC victory in Surabaya {{probably}} accelerated the fall of Mataram. The defeated <b>rebel</b> <b>forces</b> retreated inland, driving closer to Mataram's capital and triggering an early attack on the court. Secondly, the alliance between the king and the foreign, Christian VOC strengthened the Islamic character of the rebellion. Amangkurat I's successor, Amangkurat II, later told the VOC that the alliance with the VOC pushed his cousin Pangeran Purbaya towards the rebel side, and Purbaya's forces were among those who later overran the capital.|$|E

The third playable character, Havilan, is a veteran piloting a flying gunboat.|$|R
5|$|Khanh {{returned}} to the palace and reported {{the result of his}} conversation to the Ngos. He recommended that Diệm resign due {{to the demands of the}} <b>rebel</b> <b>forces</b> and protestors outside the palace. Madame Nhu railed against Diệm agreeing to a power-sharing arrangement, asserting that it was the destiny of Diệm and his family to save the country. Madame Nhu's aggressive stance and persistent calls for Khanh to attack, prompted the general to threaten to leave. This forced Diệm to silence his sister-in-law, and Khanh remained with the president.|$|E
5|$|McClellan then {{resisted}} the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders {{to move the}} Army of the Ohio against <b>rebel</b> <b>forces</b> in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November, Hurdt and Amangkurat {{were joined}} by a column led by Willem Bastinck from Surabaya, {{accompanied}} by 800 ox-carts carrying supplies. This convoy was sent {{with help from the}} Duke of Tumapel, the VOC's Javanese ally, and Karaeng Galesong, a former ally of Trunajaya whose allegiance was wavering. On 6 November, <b>rebel</b> <b>forces</b> raided these carts, burnt around ten of them, and killed some people. The VOC later moved these supplies inside a palisade fortification built in the aftermath of Suradipa's attack.|$|E

5|$|The {{most active}} <b>rebel</b> <b>forces</b> hailed from Jabal Nablus. The {{principal}} rebel clans were the Qasims of Beit Wazan, the Jayyusi clan of Kur, the Jarrar clan of Sanur and the Barqawi clan of Shufa. Qasim al-Ahmad led {{the forces of}} Jabal Nablus. In the greater Jerusalem region, the main rebel clans were Sam'an of Ras Karkar, Barghouti of Bani Zeid and, until their defection to Ibrahim Pasha, Abu Ghosh of Qaryat al-Inab. They were often supported by Qasim's men. The Bedouin Ta'amirah tribe from the Bethlehem region also {{played a major role}} in the fighting around Jerusalem. In the Hebron Hills, the rebels were led by the Amr clan of Dura while further southwest around Gaza, the Bedouin tribes of Jabarat and Awawna fought against the Egyptians and their Bedouin allies. In the north, the <b>rebel</b> <b>forces</b> around Acre and Haifa were commanded by the Madi family, while the Hawwara irregulars of Aqil Agha, who had defected from Ibrahim Pasha's service, and local sheikhs did most of the fighting in the heart of the Galilee, outside of Safad.

The weather was much of the time during the march, cold, and the ground rough and frozen, the shoes of the men worn out and much severe suffering was endured.|$|R
