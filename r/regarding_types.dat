50|$|In 1930 she was {{appointed}} to the post of assistant engineer at the Department of Development and Research of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in New York. While working there she discovered an unusual cubic semi-symmetric graph with 54 vertices and three edges exiting each vertex, formed as the incidence graph of the 27 points and 27 lines in a 3 &times; 3 &times; 3 three-dimensional grid. It has since been demonstrated to be the smallest possible cubic semi-symmetric graph. Thinking it was a theoretical discovery without practical application Gray did not publish her findings. Thirty-six years later, I. Z. Bouwer rediscovered and described the graph and explained how it could answer questions <b>regarding</b> <b>types</b> of symmetry. The graph is commonly known as the Gray graph. Today it and similar graphs are crucial in network theory.|$|E

5000|$|Wolfe, Dattilo, & Gast (2003) [...] {{found that}} using a token economy {{in concert with}} {{cooperative}} games increased pro-social behaviors (e.g. statements of encouragement, praise, or appreciation, shaking hands, and giving high fives) while decreasing anti-social ones (swearing, threatening peers with physical harm, name-calling, and physical aggression). The use of a response-cost system has been efficacious in reducing problem behaviors. A single-subject withdrawal design employing non-contingent reinforcement with response cost was used to reduce maladaptive verbal and physical behaviors exhibited by a post-institutional student with ADHD (Nolan & Filter, 2012). Wilhite & Bullock (2012) [...] implemented a social-skills training group to increase the social competence of students with EBDs. Results showed significant differences between pre- and post-intervention disciplinary referrals, {{as well as several}} other elements of behavioral-ratings scales. Evidence also exists for the usefulness of social reinforcement as a part of behavioral interventions for children with ADHD. A study by Kohls, Herpertz-Dahlmann, & Kerstin (2009) [...] found that both social and monetary rewards increased inhibition control in both the control and experimental groups. However, results showed that children with ADHD benefitted more from social reinforcement than typical children, indicating that social reinforcement can significantly improve cognitive control in ADHD children. The techniques listed are {{only a few of the}} many types of behavioral interventions that can be used to treat children with EBDs. Additional information <b>regarding</b> <b>types</b> of behavioral interventions can be found in the 2003 book Behavioral, Social, and Emotional Assessment of Children and Adolescents by Kenneth Merrell.|$|E
5000|$|In {{database}} and information retrieval theory {{the distinction between}} concepts and relations and the classification of relations into different types was also developing at this time. The “relation operators” for example of J. Farradane published in papers dating back to 1966 included such notions as space/time factors, dimensional relations, causation (or functional dependence) and association. An attempt was made by Perry, Kent and Berry to break down subjects into semantic factors (reminiscent of earlier work by J.Kaiser (1915) and S. R. Ranganathan (1933) in their work on library classification systems) but was abandoned due to the immense complexity of relations involved even for the simplest subjects.The advent of computer technology was of revolutionary importance in allowing these general ideas to be taken forward. The earliest models in electronic database managements systems (DBMS), the hierarchical and network models, were superseded in 1970 when E.F.Codd proposed the “relational model” which was then developed and transformed into the database programming language SQL (Structured Query Language). Eugen Wüster, in what he called terminology science, also drew on the important distinction between concepts and relations and, borrowing ideas from David Hume (see above) <b>regarding</b> <b>types</b> of relation, set out his findings in his General Theory of Terminology (1974). Further work on Wüster’s concept systems and concept relations was published in 1994 by Anita Nuopponen [...] and taken up {{in the preparation of}} ISO 12620 Data Categories and in the further development of data categories in 1999 by researchers at Brigham Young and Kent Universities in the USA.

40|$|Introduction: Breast conserving surgery {{followed}} by radiotherapy is an established modality of treatment in early {{breast cancer patients}} since three decades, but yet {{it has not been}} adopted worldwide. Purpose: The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the factors affecting decision making <b>regarding</b> <b>type</b> of surgery and satisfaction with type of surgery in North Indian women with early breast cancer. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was prepared to assess the factors responsible for decision making <b>regarding</b> <b>type</b> of surgery (breast conserving surgery (BCS) versus modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and to evaluate involvement of patient in decision making <b>regarding</b> the <b>type</b> of surgery. 47 women with early breast cancer on radiotherapy or on follow-up were interviewed by the resident doctors. Results: Out of 47 patients, 28 underwent BCS and 19 MRM. Women undergoing BCS were younger, more literate than in those undergoing MRM. In the two arms (BCS versus MRM), decision for surgery was made by surgeon alone in 53 % versus 73 %, along with patient in 42 % versus 6 %, and only 10 % women participated in decision making in each arm. Only 50 % versus 30 % patients had a clear understanding of the risks and benefits of both procedures in the two arms. Conclusion: North Indian women do not independently take decision <b>regarding</b> any <b>type</b> of surgery. The reason for opting for either kind of surgery was based on surgeon′s recommendation or concern about recurrence. Body image was not an issue amongst majority...|$|R
