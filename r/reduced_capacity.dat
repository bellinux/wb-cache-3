5|$|On July 16, 1933, a {{crowd of}} 3,000 watched the driving of the first stake at the low dam site, and {{excavation}} soon began. Core drilling commenced that September while the Bureau of Reclamation accelerated its studies and designs for the dam. It would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and hydroelectricity, though at a <b>reduced</b> <b>capacity.</b> Most importantly, it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee. However, the dam's design provided for future raising and upgrading.|$|E

It has been established that volatile oils of medicinal plants have on average a <b>reducing</b> <b>capacity</b> of 3. 5 - 220 mmol/kg oil. The <b>reducing</b> <b>capacities</b> of the main constituents of volatile oils are 0. 165 - 65. 5 mmol/kg in concentrated oils.

40|$|Formaldehyde {{is reduced}} to methyl alcohol by living cells of a creatinine-decomposing strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The amount of HCHO taken up in 30 minutes by 3 x 1010 cells of this {{organism}} is termed its <b>reducing</b> <b>capacity.</b> It {{was found to be}} 400 to 480 µg. The reaction takes place over wide pH and temperature ranges, is independent of the concentration of formaldehyde as long as the latter is not high enough to exert a toxic effect on the cell, but depends on the number of bacteria present. In cultures, 3 to 7 days old, there is a decline in <b>reducing</b> <b>capacity</b> without a proportionate {{decrease in the number of}} viable cells. On the other hand in cultures, 2 to 4 weeks old, the number of viable cells determines the amount of HCHO taken up. N/ 100 NaOH depresses the <b>reducing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the organism without affecting bacterial viability. Exposure of bacterial suspensions to temperatures of 46 – 52 °C. for 10 minutes causes a far more rapid decrease in the number of viable cells than in <b>reducing</b> <b>capacity.</b> Incubation of cellular suspensions with nutrient substances, which are able to support adequately the growth of the organism, for 30 minutes prior to the addition of HCHO, induces increases in <b>reducing</b> <b>capacity.</b> The uptake of HCHO by different microorganisms seems to be related to their gaseous and nutritional requirements. Strains of P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens are predominantly aerobic, least fastidious in their nutritional requirements, most active against HCHO, and least susceptible to the action of aureomycin and chloromycetin. The potential significance of cellular <b>reducing</b> <b>capacity</b> is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Seabirds {{have made}} {{numerous}} adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology {{has been shaped}} by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a <b>reduced</b> <b>capacity</b> for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E
5|$|The advent in {{the mid-1990s}} of ’no-frills’ carriers, such as easyJet, has had a {{significant}} impact on air travel in the UK. In 2005 these airlines carried 77.5million passengers, up from just 4.3million in 1996. They are responsible for the growth of regional airports, operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in 1996, and increasing the choice of international destinations, serving 150 in 2006, compared to 12 a decade earlier. The annual rate of growth in the overall demand for air travel has remained stable since 1975, averaging 5.8 per cent annually. Recent growth is being serviced by the no-frills airlines at the expense of traditional carriers which, since 2000, have experienced flat or declining traffic levels. In response, traditional carriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively on price, leading to lower prices on the short haul routes serviced by this sector, especially in business fares. They have also limited or <b>reduced</b> <b>capacity</b> and in some cases launched no-frills subsidiaries of their own.|$|E

5|$|The {{area where}} Armenia lies is of {{interest}} to seismologists and geologists because of the relatively early stage of continental collision occurring there and because the earthquake's strong aftershock sequence and significant surface faulting presented scientists with an environment to study reverse faulting. Twelve days after the mainshock a French-Soviet team installed a temporary seismic network in the epicentral area to record aftershock activity (a separate expedition from the United States also visited the site). The initial portion of work included nearly a full week setting up the seismometers and optimizing their operation and, with that complete, two full weeks of continuous operation was then completed with twenty six seismometers covering an area over 1500 square kilometers. The final stage concluded with seven weeks (through the end of February 1989) of continued monitoring with a <b>reduced</b> <b>capacity</b> of twenty units.|$|E
5|$|After the {{construction}} of the Centenary Stand, the Spion Kop was redeveloped {{for the start of the}} 1994–95 season. The stand became all-seater, retaining the single tier with a <b>reduced</b> <b>capacity</b> of 12,000. In Evans's first full season in charge Liverpool finished in fourth place, their best finish since the departure of Dalglish. The club reached the sixth round of the FA Cup, before losing 2–1 to Tottenham Hotspur and reached the 1995 Football League Cup Final against Bolton Wanderers. Two goals from Steve McManaman helped Liverpool to a 2–1 victory as they won their fifth League Cup. The season also saw several long-serving players leave the club, as Grobbelaar, Nicol and Ronnie Whelan departed. Before the start of the 1995–96 season, Liverpool signalled their intent to improve upon the previous season, signing forward Stan Collymore for a British club record £8.5million. Collymore scored the only goal in a 1–0 win over Sheffield Wednesday in the first game of the season. Liverpool finished in third place. They reached the final of the FA Cup against Manchester United; an 85th-minute goal from Eric Cantona secured a 1–0 victory for United.|$|E
5|$|For 1966 the Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit was increased to 3.0 litres from the 1.5 litres {{of the previous}} five seasons. McLaren considered and discounted British Racing Motors (BRM), Maserati, Coventry Climax and Oldsmobile engines before opting for a Ford V8 engine. This engine was originally designed for the Indianapolis 500, the premier single-seater oval track race in the United States, {{and had to be}} reduced in capacity from 4.2 litres to the 3.0 litre limit. This choice was partly motivated by the belief that it might bring financial support from Ford, although this never materialised. Ex BMW and Daimler-Benz engineer Klaus von Rucker was initially appointed to carry out the conversion of the engine in England. However, progress was slow so the project was transferred to Traco Engineering in California, United States, where extensive modifications were made to the internals under the oversight of McLaren's Gary Knutson. In its 4.2 litre form the Ford engine produced 470bhp and McLaren expected the <b>reduced</b> <b>capacity</b> version to produce about 335bhp. In fact, it produced 300bhp in a narrow power band and was further handicapped by its large size and weight; combined with the gearbox it weighed nearly as much as rival team Brabham's entire car. In order to allow time to further develop the Ford, McLaren also used a Serenissima M166 3.0 litre V8 engine for some of the races. This engine produced about 260bhp and required modifications to be made to the monocoque but was at least relatively light and compact. Four- and five-speed ZF transaxle gearboxes and a Borg & Beck clutch were employed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an HPLC-UV-MS method for quantitative determination of andrographolide and dehydroandrographolide in Andrographis Herba and establishment of its chromatographic fingerprint. The method was validated for linearity, limit of detection and quantification, inter- and intra-day precisions, repeatability, stability and recovery. All the validation results of quantitative determination and fingerprinting methods were satisfactory. The developed method was then applied to assay the contents of andrographolide and dehydroandrographolide and to acquire the fingerprints of all the collected Andrographis Herba samples. Furthermore, similarity analysis and principal component analysis were used to reveal the similarities and differences between the samples {{on the basis of the}} characteristic peaks. More importantly, the DPPH free radical-scavenging and ferric <b>reducing</b> <b>capacities</b> of the Andrographis Herba samples were assayed. By bivariate correlation analysis, we found that six compounds are positively correlated to DPPH free radical scavenging and ferric <b>reducing</b> <b>capacities,</b> and four compounds are negatively correlated to DPPH free radical scavenging and ferric <b>reducing</b> <b>capacities...</b>|$|R

30|$|There {{are many}} {{reports in the}} {{literature}} which shows the relation between phenolic content, antioxidant activity and potent in green synthesis of SNPs. Goodarzi et al. evaluated the antioxidant potential, total <b>reducing</b> <b>capacity</b> and SNPs synthetic potential of methanolic leaf extracts of seven plant species. They revealed that plants with high antioxidant potentials also showed higher total phenolic contents and total <b>reducing</b> <b>capacity.</b> In fact, {{the order of the}} plants <b>reducing</b> <b>capacity</b> was similar to that of their antioxidant potential [14]. Subramanian et al. demonstrated that the stem bark extract of Shorea roxburghii contain high level of total phenolic compounds and radical scavenging activity. They also revealed that the plant extract could be used as an efficient green reducing agent for the production of SNPs [27]. Ahmad et al. reported that the phenolic compounds in pineapple, exhibit excellent antioxidant activity and these phenols can react with a free radical to form the phenoxy radicals. Therefore, the use of natural antioxidants for the synthesis of SNPs seems to be a good alternative which can be due to its benign composition [28].|$|R
