5000|$|A [...] "refractory" [...] {{gold ore}} is an ore that has ultra fine gold {{particles}} disseminated throughout its gold occluded minerals. These ores are naturally resistant to recovery by standard cyanidation and carbon adsorption processes. These <b>refractory</b> <b>ores</b> require pre-treatment {{in order for}} cyanidation {{to be effective in}} recovery of the gold. A refractory ore generally contains sulfide minerals, organic carbon, or both. Sulfide minerals are impermeable minerals that occlude gold particles, making it difficult for the leach solution to form a complex with the gold. Organic carbon present in gold ore may adsorb dissolved gold-cyanide complexes {{in much the same way}} as activated carbon. This so-called [...] "preg-robbing" [...] carbon is washed away because it is significantly finer than the carbon recovery screens typically used to recover activated carbon.|$|E

50|$|Smith {{was born}} in Sydney, the eldest {{surviving}} of thirteen children of Scots parents David Milne Smith, tailor of Old South Head Road, and his wife Isabella, née Young. Baptised as John Smith by the Rev. John McGarvie, Smith added 'McGarvie' to his name. At 13 years of age Smith was apprenticed and learned the trade of watchmaker and jeweller; by 1867 he opened a business for himself at Sydney which he continued for about 20 years. Smith took up photography, which led to his studying chemistry at the University of Sydney from 1867, and later, metallurgy. Smith began work an assayer and metallurgist in the mid-1880s. He developed improvements {{in the treatment of}} <b>refractory</b> <b>ores</b> and his advice was of great value in dealing with problems of this kind at the Sunny Corner mining-field and at Broken Hill. At Mount Morgan, Queensland, he did important work in connection with the chlorine process of extracting gold.|$|E
40|$|The {{extraction}} of metals from ores {{by means of}} appropriate solvents has been practised for many years. A number of methods involve leaching of crushed ores held in tanks or ponds in which the solvent is sprayed over the ore, of which effectiveness is enhanced by mechanical agitation and increased temperature and pressure. In contrast, this investigation uses a high-velocity impinging stream reactor to induce micro-cracking in the ore phase, and consequently enhance leaching kinetics by improved solvent/ore contact. Initial tests show that jet reactor leaching of a free milling ore can increase gold recovery by 10 % while decreasing leaching time by up to 90 %. Further investigation is required regarding <b>refractory</b> <b>ores,</b> {{taking into account the}} complex mineralogy of each ore. The three <b>refractory</b> <b>ores</b> that were tested, all behaved very similarly when subjected to jet reaction. There is no apparent improvement in recovery.

50|$|The workers {{crushed the}} rock {{to release the}} gold, {{concentrated}} the gold by gravity methods, and then exposed the concentrate to mercury that would amalgamate or mix with the gold.

In these conditions, gold was chemically bound to the rock, and very difficult to remove. It was called <b>refractory</b> gold <b>ore.</b> For many years, the Homestake operated as the only major gold mine in the Black Hills.

In this paper, biooxidation of <b>refractory</b> gold <b>ore</b> by mixed moderate thermophiles culture in airlift bioreactor {{has been well}} studied. Firstly, a laboratory scale airlift bioreactor unit has been designed for bacterial preoxidation of <b>refractory</b> gold <b>ore,</b> a mixed moderate thermophilic culture was incubated. The orthogonal experiment was performed to investigate the effects of particle size, pulp density, aeration rate and initial pH.

On {{the base of the}} airlift bioreactor unit, a continuous airlift bioreactor was designed. The preoxidation of <b>refractory</b> gold <b>ore</b> by a mixed culture of moderately thermophilic bacteria also was investigated in this equipment.

40|$|Australia {{is now an}} {{important}} gold producer in the world. The nature of Australian gold production is briefly reviewed and the hydrometallurgy of gold extraction is considered. The choice of processing routes for free milling, complex and <b>refractory</b> <b>ores</b> is discussed. For free milling ores, cyanidation and recovery by the Carbon-in-Pulp/Carbon-in-Leach process (CIP/CIL) is the primary and proven treatment process. Copper containing ores are discussed in some detail as they interfere in the CIP/CIL process. Oxygen consuming and preg-robbing ores are also described. Five different classes of process options for pretreating <b>refractory</b> <b>ores</b> are considered in detail. These options include: ultrafine grinding; acid and alkaline pressure oxidation; {{and a variety of}} chemical pretreatments such as: Activox process, HMC process and Electrolytic oxidation process. In Australia, the two pre-eminent options for refractory gold ore pretreatment are roasting and biooxidation and this development is reported. The trial of pressure cyanidation of stibnite concentrates at the Golden Spec mine in Australia is described. Pyrolysis, the Nitrox/Redox process, the Artech/Cashman process and the Caro's acid process have not gained commercial status so far. The potential for resin-in-pulp (RIP) to replace CIP/CIL is discussed. The use of cyanide has generated environmental concerns because of its toxicity and therefore research on alternative gold recovery processes using non-toxic reagents is considered. The key candidates are: ammoniacal thiosulphate, thiourea and halide solutions. The chemistry of these leaching systems is briefly described and proposed flowsheets are referenced.

Furthermore, the mixture of various chelating reagents can recover the copper sulfides and oxides simultaneously from the complicated copper ores, which is attributed to the synergy among collectors. Thus we conclude that it is an important flotation method by using chelating collectors in conjunction with other traditional collectors, by which the synergy can break through the limitation of single reagent and enhance the flotation efficiency...|$|E

40|$|<b>Refractory</b> uranium <b>ores</b> {{containing}} uranium as multiple oxides typically require leaching at elevated temperatures (> 75 °C) {{and acid}} concentrations (> 50 g/L H 2 SO 4) {{in order to}} effectively extract the uranium. Some uranium ores contain large amounts of acid-soluble gangue, such as carbonates or soluble silicates and when the carbonate content exceeds approximately 8 %, the acid consumption by gangue may render acid leaching uneconomical. In these situations, leaching in alkaline-carbonate is a potential option. The advantages of this approach include improved selectivity for uranium over other elements, reduced gangue dissolution {{and the ability to}} recycle the lixiviant. One disadvantage is slower rates of leaching and hence the need for finer grinding. However, when a uranium ore contains significant amounts of acid-soluble gangue with refractory uranium mineralisation (a double <b>refractory</b> <b>ore),</b> the process options are more limited. Refractory uranium minerals, such as brannerite, are often reported as slow to dissolve in alkaline carbonate media. If a double <b>refractory</b> uranium <b>ore</b> is to be processed effectively, it is necessary to understand the behaviour of minerals like brannerite in the alkaline leaching system. In the present study, a sample of brannerite was leached in a sodium carbonate solution (1 mol/L total carbonate) for 24 h at temperatures from 50 to 90 °C. The effect of potassium ferricyanide (25 mmol/L) added as an oxidant was also examined. All residues were characterised by XRD and SEM-EDX techniques, and both uranium and titanium dissolution rates were monitored. Uranium extraction reached 83 % after 24 h of leaching. The leaching rate showed a high dependence on temperature with an activation energy of 45 kJ/mol. The residue was pitted, similar to what has been observed previously after leaching in acidic media. At 80 °C and 90 °C, the titanium re-precipitated within the pits, potentially slowing the dissolution process...|$|R
