The static performance on concrete can not be provided to estimate the variation of concrete under high strain <b>rates</b> concerning <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads.</b> by introducing three point bending test under static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads,</b> the plane strain fracture toughness KIC and KId was measured.

The failure considered is always the vertebral body failure due to crushing, but in reality, condition of disc plays important role in deciding the failure of the vertebrae. The detailed axis-symmetry model was utilized to understand the effect of various factors on the end-plate failure mechanism and it is observed that deflection of the end plate is critical failure criteria. The age and the peak load were found to be the significant factors dictating end-plate failure. In young people the deflection of end plate was higher as compared to the old people due to hydrated disc capable of swelling under <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads.</b> The simplified three dimensional model of vertebral motion segment L 2 -L 3 was developed {{in order to understand the}} effect of nucleus pulpous pressure in end-plate deflection and to incorporate this model into the DRI model in order to estimate the effect of <b>dynamic</b> <b>loading</b> on the resulting spinal injury.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} full {{dimensional}} micromechanics-inspired constitutive model for polycrystalline shape-memory alloys. The model is presented in two forms: (1) The one-dimensional framework where we picture the ability of the model in capturing main properties of shape memory alloys such as superelasticity and shape-memory effect; (2) The full dimensional model where micromechanics origins of the model, the concepts emerged from those analysis and their relation to macroscopic properties in both single and polycrystals are presented. We use this framework to study the effects of the texture and anisotropy in the material behavior. Since phase transformation often competes with plasticity in shape-memory alloys, we incorporate that phenomenon into our model. We also demonstrate the ability of the model to predict the response of the material and track the phase transformation process for multi-axial, proportional and non-proportional loading and unloading experiments. We consider both stress-controlled and strain-controlled experiments and develop the model for isothermal, adiabatic and non-adiabatic thermal conditions. Adiabatic heating and loading rate both lead to the apparent hardening at high rates. We also visit this problem and examine the relative role of these two factors. Finally we extend our model to study the reversible "bcc" to "hcp" martensitic phase transformation in pure iron.

Moreover, the coal rocks that are originally identified as no burst tendency may also show burst failure given high <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> or <b>dynamic</b> <b>load.</b> Here, the instantaneous dynamic disturbance of mine tremor plays a dominant role in the burst failure process.

Consistent data on the dynamic behavior of foam is also necessary for designing energy-absorbing countermeasures based on foam such as for vehicle occupant safety protection. Strain rates of the order of 100 - 500 s− 1 are quite common in such design applications; strain rates of this range cannot be obtained with an ordinary UTM (universal testing machine) and a special test set-up is usually needed. In the current study, a unique approach has been suggested according to which quasi-static tests at low strain rates and low velocity drop tests at medium strain rates are utilized to arrive at an empirical relation between initial peak stress and logarithm of strain rate for a rigid closed-cell PU foam. Using a stress-scaling methodology and the empirical relation mentioned, foam stress-strain curves are obtained for a number of strain rates spanning low (from 0. 00033 s− 1) to high strain rates (up to 1000 s− 1).

The mechanical model comprises a nonlinear Winkler-type model {{that accounts for}} soil resistance acting along the circumference of the pile, and a coupled viscous damper that simulates changes in radiation damping with increasing material non-linearity. Three-dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) simulations are conducted for a pile in radially homogeneous soil to identify the critical parameters governing the response. The identified parameters, i. e., hydraulic conductivity, <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>dynamic</b> <b>loading,</b> dilation angle and liquefaction potential are then expressed in dimensionless form. Next, the macroelement parameters are calibrated {{as a function of}} the soil properties and the effective stress. A semi-empirical approach that accounts for the effects of soil-structure interaction on pore pressure generation in the vicinity of pile is used to detect the onset of liquefaction. The predictions are compared with field data obtained using blast induced liquefaction and centrifuge tests and found to be in good agreement. Finally, the macroelement formulation is extended to account for coupling in both lateral directions. FEM simulations indicate that response assuming no coupling between the two horizontal directions for biaxial loading tends to overestimate the soil resistance and fails to capture features like 'apparent negative stiffness', 'strain hardening' and 'rounded corners'.
