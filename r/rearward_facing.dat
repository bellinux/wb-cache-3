50|$|The Department of Transport was keen to see {{wheelchair}} accessible taxis and the FX4W wheelchair conversion, which was available from early 1986, enabled the FX4 {{to provide that}} facility. In this, the curb side passenger door was made capable of opening 180° and the nearside part of the partition could be moved forward to accommodate the <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> wheelchair {{in place of the}} nearside tip-up seat.|$|E
50|$|The dart {{housing is}} made from a {{tungsten}} alloy. The darts are each 396 mm long with a diameter of 22 mm and weigh about 900 g. Around half the weight of each dart, approximately 450 g, is its explosive charge, detonated by a delayed-action, impact activated fuze. Each dart consists of a rotating fore-body with two canard fins attached to a non-rotating rear assembly which has four fins. The rear assembly of each dart also houses the electronics that guide the missile, including a <b>rearwards</b> <b>facing</b> sensor.|$|R

50|$|In 2013, a new {{car seat}} {{regulation}} was introduced: “i-Size” {{is the name of}} a new European safety regulation that affects car seats for children under 15 months of age. It came into effect in July 2013 and provides extra protection in several ways, most notably by providing <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> travel for children up to 15 months instead of 9 to 12 months, which the previous EU regulation advised.|$|E
50|$|Passengers, {{standing}} and seated, in forward and <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> seats sustained various minor injuries during the deceleration and collision sequence. The injuries ranged from muscle strain to a shoulder/arm while {{holding onto the}} hand rails and bracing for impact, bruising from impact with seat frames and a minor cut when a passenger’s head struck a poster frame near the driver’s cabin. Both the driver and guard sustained superficial injuries.|$|E
50|$|The first P-30 was {{delivered}} in January 1934. Testing {{showed that the}} gunner's cockpit was uncomfortable and cold at the high altitudes where the P-30 was intended to fight, while the <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> gunners were liable to black out when the aircraft was maneuvered. Despite these concerns, on 6 December 1934, the U.S. Air Corps placed an order for a further 50 P-30As, with more powerful V-1570-61 engines driving a three-bladed variable-pitch propeller and with oxygen supplies for the crew.|$|E
40|$|Research {{on human}} {{tolerance}} in crashes {{has found that}} rear-facing seating offers increased protection over forward seating. However, rearward seats are only available in limited settings. In this study, passengers were observed and seating preferences recorded on the Washington Metropolitan Rail System (Metro). Only 25 per cent of adults <b>faced</b> <b>rearward</b> compared to 66 per cent of children. Since children appear willing to <b>face</b> <b>rearward,</b> rear-facing seating in school buses and other vehicles might be acceptable to them and provide safety benefits as well...|$|R
2500|$|On 13 September 2015, a new prototype, marked '2016', begun testing. It had {{noticeable}} improvements, such as apparently changed DSI {{bumps on}} the intakes, which save weight, complexity and radar signature. The DSI changes suggested {{the possibility of}} more powerful engines being used than on its predecessors, {{likely to be an}} advanced 14-ton thrust derivative of the Russian AL-31 or Chinese Shenyang WS-10 turbofan engines, though, by 2020 the J-20 is planned to use the 18–19 ton WS-15 engine, enabling the jet to super-cruise without using afterburners. The trapezoidal flight booms around the engines were enlarged, possibly to accommodate <b>rearwards</b> <b>facing</b> radars or electronic jamming equipment. The fuselage extends almost entirely up to the engine's exhaust nozzles. Compared to its [...] "2014" [...] and [...] "2015" [...] predecessors, the J-20's fuselage contains more of engine's surface area inside the stealthy fuselage, providing greater rear-facing stealth against enemy radar.|$|R

50|$|When it {{was clear}} that the {{magnetron}} was known to the Germans, the RAF released its night fighter version, AI Mk. VIII radar, for use over Europe. This radar provided a significant advantage to the RAF over the older systems used by the Germans, and for the first time the RAF was able to seriously disrupt German night fighter operations by attacking them directly. Aircraft that did survive reported that there was no warning of the attack, and it was quickly surmised that the RAF had introduced a new microwave AI radar. This led to the rapid introduction of the Naxos ZR, tuned to the Mk. VIII's frequency and equipped with <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> antennas.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{the line}} of Dye and Proto matrix, the SLG is not a Matrix {{although}} it does share some characteristics and says Matrix {{on the top of}} the box. It is a sear tripper that uses the [...] "unbalanced" [...] spool-valve design and has a mechanical solenoid unlike pneumatic solenoids used in electropneumatic markers. The SLG's bolt is not a FUSE bolt system either. The bolt is held back by a sear which is tripped by the solenoid when the user pulls the trigger. After firing, when the air in the dump chamber has fired the ball, a small forward face on the bolt which is constantly pressurized with air (at operating pressure from the regulator) provides the rearward force to reset the bolt. This is in contrast to unbalanced electropneumatic spools where this face is drained of pressure by the solenoid to fire. This face has less surface area than <b>rearward</b> <b>faces</b> in contact with dump chamber air, creating an imbalance of force which pushes the bolt closed.|$|R

50|$|The TACR2 {{was built}} on the Carmichael Commando chassis. This is a 775mm (30.5inch) six-wheeled rear {{extension}} of the classic Range Rover. It uses the Range Rover drivetrain, with the two leading axles (front axle and original rear axle) powered through the Range Rover permanent four wheel drive transfer case. The new rear axle is an unpowered trailer, using similar coil spring suspension. The chassis was converted by Carmichael from a standard Range Rover chassis supplied by Land Rover {{in the form of a}} drivable chassis cab, therefore most components were standard Range Rover. Some TACR2s have been converted to six wheel drive. This is usually achieved by welding an input cone mounting flange to the rear of the middle axle in place of the diff pan, attaching a second, <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> 'input' cone (as an output cone), linked by a short prop to the input cone of the rear axle, this and the diff and diff pan need to be turned over (so the crown wheel is on the opposite side to the middle axle's crown wheel) to maintain correct rotation. This should be used in conjunction with free wheeling hubs to prevent diff wind-up when driving on-road or tarmac.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to the 1930 {{formation}} of Ohio's Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban, {{a number of}} struggling Indiana interurban lines were combined to create the new Indiana Railroad. In 1931, the IRR ordered interurbans from the Pullman and American Car and Foundry based upon the Cincinnati Car Company Red Devil design but with improvements. More aluminum was used, and a heavier Commonwealth truck design was adopted to allow more stability at speed. The IRR operated multiple car coupled trains from Indianapolis south to Louisville, so the new IRR lightweights had couplers and a rounded rear end, unlike the Red Devil's squared rear end. The round end allowed coupled car operation around tight curves in town streets. IRR abandoned operations in 1941, and LVT purchased IRR parlor car #55 to replace former Red Devil car 1004 lost in a fire due to 1004's malfunctioning electric car heater at Philadelphia and Western's King Manor station. (The fire also burned the station.) Car 55 arrived on the LVT property in IRR's bright [...] "traction orange" [...] paint scheme and LVT's Fairview shopmen humorously labeled it the [...] "Golden Calf." [...] The shop crew changed the former parlor seating to coach seating and repainted the exterior with LVT's white with red trim (called by the LVT a dramatic [...] "Picador Cream and Mountain Ash Scarlet") and numbered it LVT 1030. It stood out from its former C&LE Red Devil brothers by having more tapered front windows and the round rear end. LVT also replaced the IR Commonwealth trucks with the Cincinnati Car Company's ABC-74D trucks (bogies) salvaged from the 1004. They retained the interior club arrangement, but installed a refrigerator at the first left side window. Transit company officials introduced No.1030 to the public on September 14, 1941 and on October 3, 1941, the luxury car entered the revenue service on the Liberty Bell Route. Passenger traffic increased steadily during World War II and more passenger capacity was needed, so December 1941 and May 1942, several side-facing individual chairs were removed and replaced by forward and <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> sofas {{in order to increase}} the seating capacity from thirty to thirty-six. The original IR car design placed the motorman's controls on the left side, but the controller and brake stand were moved to the center by the LVT and a passenger loading door was added at the left front to provide southbound passenger access to the left side Norristown platform. This door was also used at Lansdale and Souderton on northbound trips to allow passengers to unload curbside rather than into the street. Although the frequent stops and occasional steep grades (the climb from Souderton's Broad Street to Summit street was severe) were more demanding on traction motors than Ohio's had been, the former Red Devils and the 1030 performed well until LVT abandonment in 1951. As company earnings severely declined due to post World War 2 diminishing ridership, seriously disabled cars were often set aside, not repaired, and cannibalized for parts for other equipment. Car 1030 is now preserved and operating at the Seashore Trolley Museum.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} made within the Child Safety group at Volvo Car Corporation.   The {{purpose of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis was to study the different aspects of <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child restraint systems, which is the safest way for small children to travel, in order to suggest improvements {{in the development of}} child restraint systems. The studies included scientific articles regarding child safety and fatally injured children in car accidents, both in Sweden and internationally. The overall aim is to find factors that enables the increase in usage of <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child restraint systems, including the increase of usage time to as long as possible.   Swedish accident data, obtained by the Swedish Traffic Data Acquisation, was studied. It was found that the fatally injured children during car accidents in Sweden between the years 2000 - 2016 commonly were involved in extraordinarily accident scenarios with an outcome independent of how they were restrained. The literature study and the survey that was made were both supporting the statement of inconvenience while using <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child restraint systems. The inconvenience often corresponded to different types of misuse. The main issue with <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> according to the responding parents was lack of leg space, both for their child but also for the driver and the front seat passenger. These issues made some parents turning their children forward facing at early age, whereas they could still fit in the <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child restraint system.   One key in order to increase the global use of <b>rearward</b> <b>facing</b> child restraint systems lies in changes of the materials and design. A more lightweight and compact design is suggested, providing a more spacious travel environment for the children and easier mounting for the parents. The need of education is apparent, preferable by means of social media due to the easiness of sending information globally with low cost...|$|E
