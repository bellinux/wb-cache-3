These models, however, have some shortcomings. First, {{the same model}} may not apply to all countries. Second, the drift and diffusion may depend not only on rt− 1 but also on further lags.

These questions are empirically analyzed for six major countries with the following findings. First, there are considerable differences in drift and diffusion across the countries.

40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen an {{explosion}} of activity in the clinical and research aspects of pediatric hepatology. The increased use of ultrasounds techniques and routine laboratory evaluation has drawn attention to several previously undiagnosed condition in childhood. The discipline {{has grown from a}} cataloguing of the many unique disorders that can occur during infancy and childhood to a more profound understanding of the genetic, biochemical, and virologic basis for many pediatric liver diseases. Nowadays hepatopathies still represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However advances in diagnosis and treatment, particularly the successful development of transplantation, have dramatically improved the outcome for infants and children with liver disease, so that many of them can now expect to grow into adult life. Sophisticated molecular genetic techniques have not only identified new genes and categorized rare defects, but have also given us an insight into pathophysiology and potential therapy. National and international collaboration through clinical database has helped us refine diagnosis and treatment of several pediatric hepatic diseases. Differently from adults, the signs and symptoms of liver disease are often non specific and can vary greatly from child to child among the different liver diseases. This is one reason for which {{it can be hard to}} diagnose. As a result, liver disease may frequently be overlooked. Because most childhood hepatic diseases are progressive and life threatening, diagnosis failure can have devastating consequences. At present for most childhood liver diseases the cause is still unknown and is poorly satisfactory. The recognition of the pathogenesis of liver disease, the implications of innovative diagnostic techniques and therapies, the investigations of new clinical aspects during long-term follow-up, and the necessity for multidisciplinary working are as important for general paediatricians as for pediatric gastroenterologists, surgeons and hepatologists. The gratifying survival of increasing numbers of young people with liver disease into adult life means that it is essential also for adult practitioners with expertise in pediatric liver disease. Therefore, our research starts from the assumption that only knowledge of unexplored aspects can be an important tool for advancing into the management of hepatic disorders in children. It should be a contribute to both provide a framework to understand pathophisiology of some hepatobiliary disorders and offer analyses of their clinical-laboratory manifestations and the strategies for managing them. This project might be also useful to create specific competences related to a integrated and multidisciplinary approach, as required in pediatric liver disease. Our study concerns three areas that still present several either pathogenetic or diagnostic uncertainties, focusing on the following aspects: 1. 	Pathogenetic aspects of pediatric portal hypertension - Do genetic prothrombotic risk factors play a role in pediatric portal vein thrombosis ? If so are they harmful also for other districts ? 2. 	Diagnostic aspects of pediatric hypertransaminasemia and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia - Which are the characteristcs of macro-aspartate aminotransferasemia (macro-AST) in pediatric age? Are current screening tests effective? Is this a “benign” condition? - Is electrophisiological evaluation of Crigler Najjar syndrome an helpful tool to detect Neurotoxic complications of chronic hyperbilirubinemia ? 3. 	Emerging complications of pediatric liver transplantation - Is erythrocytosis a possible post-transplant complication also in liver recipients ? - Does it exist a psychopatological risk in liver transplantated children ? AIM The aim of our project has been triggered by limited existing scientific evidences vs. the increasing observation of children with these problems which in clinical practice lead to frequent requests for specialist advices. In particular, the etiology of portal vein thrombosis in children affected by portal hypertension is unknown. In this thesis, we aimed to demonstrate the possible role of genetic predisposing factors, which are still not clear in childhood. This in the perspective of individuating patients at higher risk for thrombotic events also in other disctricts. Isolated increase of serum AST levels is a relatively frequent laboratoristic feature in absence of clinical symptoms. This often leads to unexpensive, time-consuming and sometimes invasive procedures. Therefore, we aimed to characterize a large series of children with cryptogenic AST levels to demonstrate the dimension and nature of macro-AST condition, and the accuracy of a simple screening test. The long term follow up was investigated as well to understand whether our previous observation that this is a benign condition is correct. Previous studies have investigated neurological aspects of genetic chronic non hemolytic hperbilirubinemia only in patients with severe forms of Crigler –Najjar Syndrome (type I). We aimed to assess the usefulness of neuroelectrophysiological studies also in patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia due to intermediate phenotype I/II Crigler-Najjar. This could be important to detect an early neurotoxic bilirubin effect without overt neurological damage, and to contribute for the appropriate timing of liver transplant. The purpose of the last two projects is to study two still poorly explored aspect of pediatric liver transplantation: the investigation and characterization of erythrocytosis, a post-transplant complication which has hitherto described only in kidney recipients, and of the psycopathological risk. We believe that to increase knowledges in the management of children undergoing liver transplantation may be extremely important because they will ultimately lead to a better quality of life. In fact it is now becoming clear that liver transplant outcome needs to be judged using a measure incorporating not only survival <b>rates</b> <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>other</b> features including psychological and social well being as well...|$|E

The tax system that seeks to raise revenue in ways that avoid distortion effects is considered neutral tax system. This point is of great importance, for it defines one aim of the current tax system and one criterion by which it may be assessed The use of effective tax rates on different types of capital assets and sources of financing and to assess on the base of calculation of the tax wedges the degree to which taxation affects the incentive to undertake investment in the Czech Republic. The precise methodology used to calculate effective tax rates on marginal investments is based on an approach developed by the King and Fullerton methodology (1984), which has become the most widely accepted method adopted to calculating effective tax rates (tax wedges). The tax wedge will vary according to the type of asset: machinery, buildings, inventory (because of different capital allowance rates relative to the assumed true economic depreciation rates) and the type of finance sources: new equity, debt, retained earnings (because the tax treatment of debt, dividends and retained earnings differs). Effective tax rates take into account not only the statutory corporate tax <b>rate,</b> <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>other</b> aspects of the tax system which determine the amount of tax paid and profitability of investment, a consideration of personal taxes.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the degree to}} which volatility in overnight interest rates leads to volatility in other short-term interest rates, and whether this relationship differs in countries with different monetary policy operating procedures. In six of the nine countries, a significantly positive relationship is found between the variance of the overnight rate and the variance of two or more longer-term rates, although in Germany the relationship was negative. Countries which directly target overnight rates tend to have a lower variance, not just for the overnight <b>rate,</b> <b>but</b> <b>also</b> for <b>other</b> short-term interest rates, than countries which target a repo rate. The relationship between overnight-rate volatility and volatility at other maturities is stronger for countries which set reserve requirements. To the extent that market volatility is an indicator of illiquidity, these results suggest that liquidity spillovers do exist across different maturities in the money-market, and that central banks can influence liquidity conditions in the money market at maturities different from that of their targeted rate. Most central banks in developed countries target a designated policy rate both in their day-to-day liquidity operations and in their “signalling operations”, i. e. public statements.

40|$|To {{establish}} a chronology of the Holocene transgression in Arctic Siberia, {{a total of}} 14 sediment cores from the Laptev Sea continental slope and shelf were studied covering the water depth range between 983 and 21 m. The age models of the cores were derived from 119 radiocarbon datings, which were all analyzed on marine biogenic calcite (mainly bivalve shells). The oldest shell sample was found at the slope and dates back to about 15. 3 cal. ka, indicating that the time interval investigated starts prior to {{the onset of the}} meltwater pulse 1 A (~ 14. 2 cal. ka) when global sea-level rose dramatically.

A diachronous reduction in ASR from the outer to the inner shelf region is recognized, which was related to the southward migration of the coastline as the primary sediment source.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, our data {{indicate}} strong azimuthal anisotropy (~[*] 9 %) of Vp in the uppermost mantle, with higher {{values in the}} direction of seafloor spreading. This observation suggests that the upper mantle preserves the alignment of olivine crystals induced by mantle flow at a mid-ocean ridge (Hess 1964; Zhang and Karato 1995). A large degree of azimuthal anisotropy is commonly observed in the uppermost mantle in regions created at a fast spreading center (e.g., Oikawa et al. 2010; Song and Kim 2012; Kodaira et al. 2014). For example, a seismic refraction survey in a section of the northwest Pacific basin, which was produced at a half-spreading rate of >[*] 80  mm/year, observed a mantle Vp of 8.5 – 8.7 and 7.9  km/s along lines parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic lineation, respectively; these values indicate an azimuthal anisotropy of 7 – 10 % in the uppermost mantle (Oikawa et al. 2010). However, another area of the Pacific basin that was created at an intermediate spreading rate (<[*] 40  mm/year) also showed high Vp of up to 8.6  km/s in the uppermost mantle parallel to the direction of seafloor spreading, although the degree of azimuthal anisotropy was not constrained (Ohira et al. 2017 a). Therefore, the azimuthal anisotropy of ~[*] 9 % observed in this study suggests that the strong anisotropy in the uppermost mantle is explained by not only a spreading <b>rate</b> <b>but</b> <b>also</b> some <b>other</b> factor.|$|R

Our aim was to identify advantages and limitations of 6 and 12 -core protocols, by extending the evaluation not only to cancer detection <b>rate</b> <b>but</b> <b>also</b> to the <b>other</b> histological findings. A total of 1. 151 patients were included in the study. Two subgroups were identified: 836 patients who had undergone a 6 -core biopsy from 2001 to 2004, and 315 patients who had undergone a 12 -core biopsy from 2005 to 2006. Cancer detection rate was 291 / 836 (34. 8 %) in group 1 (6 -core biopsy), and 148 / 315 (47 %) in group 2 (12 -core biopsy) (P< 0. 0001). The total number of histological diagnoses other than cancer was 162 / 836 in group 1 (19. 4 %) and 103 / 315 (32. 7 %) in group 2 (P< 0. 0001). In prostate biopsy, a higher number of cores seems to definitely improve its diagnostic value by dramatically decreasing the number of negative findings. The 12 -core technique is particularly effective in case of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values ranging between 4. 1 and 10 ng/mL combined with a free-to-total PSA ratio below 16 %, in case of negative digital rectal examination and when serum prostate-specific antigen levels are lower than 4 ng/mL.

40|$|CT 3; EnjS 4; Département E. A. In Mediterranean areas high {{precipitation}} variability {{and crop}} dependence on soil water availability make {{the interaction between}} climate and agricultural management a key issue for mitigating N 2 O emissions. In this study we used the STICS model to capture {{the effect of a}} water deficit gradient and precipitation variability on N 2 O emissions and mitigation strategies (i. e. N fertilizer type, grain legumes introduction in crop rotations and crop residues management) in a rainfed Mediterranean transect (HWD-Senés, MWD-Selvanera and LWD-Auzeville, i. e. high, medium and low water deficit, respectively). The model was first tested against a database of daily N 2 O fluxes measured during twelve growing seasons of winter crops at the LWD site. Several scenarios were then run on each site, always over 9 successive growing seasons to take into account precipitation variability. STICS showed a good ability to simulate the driving variables of N 2 O fluxes at the daily time scale. The mean observed and simulated cumulative emissions during the growing season were 0. 71 and 0. 82 kg N 2 O–N/ha, respectively. The simulated N 2 O emissions (mean of all scenarios) decreased with increasing water deficit being 2. 51, 0. 65 and 0. 26 kg N 2 O–N/ha/yr for LWD-Auzeville, MWD-Selvanera and HWD-Senés, respectively, which is consistent with published results. The lower N 2 O emissions in the driest sites were not only related to lower fertilization <b>rates</b> <b>but</b> <b>also</b> to <b>other</b> factors associated with the Mediterranean characteristics, particularly, the drier water regime. Simulated N 2 O emissions were highly sensitive to the interannual variability of the climatic conditions. According to the simulations, urea fertilizer would lead to slightly higher N 2 O emissions (+ 6 and + 8 %) than ammonium- and calcium nitrate, respectively. The incorporation of winter pea in the traditional cereal-based Mediterranean rotations would reduce by ca. 22 % the N 2 O emissions in HWD-Senés without changing wheat yields. Differently, in MWD-Selvanera and LWD-Auzeville, N 2 O emissions would remain unchanged since the emissions associated to the decomposition of low C:N ratio pea residues would counteract the lower application of N fertilizer. The systematic removal of crop residues at LWD-Auzeville would decrease the N 2 O emissions by 20 %. However, this practice seems not recommendable if tillage is practiced due to the concomitant decrease of soil organic matter, fact that would worsen the C footprint of the system and increase the susceptibility to soil erosion. Our work highlights the interest of combining experimental and modelling approaches to account for climatic variability and evaluate long-term effects of N 2 O mitigation practices under Mediterranean conditions...|$|R
