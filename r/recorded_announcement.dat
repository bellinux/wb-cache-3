500|$|The opening track, [...] "The Post War Dream", {{begins with}} a <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> that the {{replacement}} for the Atlantic Conveyor, a ship lost during the Falklands campaign, will be built in Japan. [...] Waters' lyrics refer to his dead father, the loss of Britain's shipbuilding industry to Japan, and Margaret Thatcher, {{before moving on to}} [...] "Your Possible Pasts", a rewritten version of one of the songs rejected for The Wall. [...] In [...] "One of the Few", another rejected song, the schoolteacher from The Wall features as the main character, presented as a war hero returned to civilian life. [...] He is unable to relate his experiences to his wife, and in [...] "The Hero's Return" [...] is tormented by the loss of one of his air crew. [...] "The Gunner's Dream" [...] discusses the post-war dream of a world free from tyranny and the threat of terrorism (a reference to the Hyde Park bombing) and is followed in [...] "Paranoid Eyes" [...] by the teacher's descent into alcoholism.|$|E

50|$|In telephony, {{a special}} {{information}} tone (SIT) is an in-band international standard signal consisting of three rising tones indicating a call has failed. It usually precedes a <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> describing the problem.|$|E
50|$|Because the SIT is {{well known}} in many countries, callers can {{understand}} their call failed even though they do not understand the language of the <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> (e.g., when calling internationally) instead of assuming the recording is voicemail or some other intended function.|$|E

5000|$|Starting on August 16, 2016 at 7:30, the KXOJ-FM {{call sign}} and format moved to 94.1 FM after 39 years of {{broadcasting}} at 100.9 FM. 100.9 FM changed call letters to KTSO and began stunting with a <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> redirecting listeners to 94.1 FM.|$|E
50|$|From many {{countries}} (such as the UK), US toll-free numbers can be dialed, but the caller first gets a <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> that the call is not free; in fact, on many carriers, {{the cost of}} calling a 'toll-free' number can be {{higher than that of}} calling a normal number.|$|E
50|$|On October 26, 2016, a test tone began being {{broadcast}} on AM 940. Call letters were also announced {{on that date}} as CFNV. The station officially began on-air testing on November 16, 2016 with music and a <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> promoting {{the launch of the}} new station with a phone number to report signal interference.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, route 149 {{was subject}} to {{intensive}} bus priority measures {{along the length of}} its route. A year later the route was used to test the iBus <b>recorded</b> <b>announcements</b> system to aid visually impaired passengers.|$|R
50|$|The {{title of}} the record is a {{reference}} to Gruffâ€™s habit of hoarding mini shampoo bottles and other complimentary hotel products whilst on tour, and the miniature hotel he built from them {{in advance of the}} <b>record's</b> <b>announcement.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A Voice Communication Control System (VCCS) is {{essentially}} an ACD with characteristics that make it more adapted to use in critical situations (no waiting for dialtone, or lengthy <b>recorded</b> <b>announcements,</b> radio and telephone lines equally easily connected to, individual lines immediately accessible etc..) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{signal is}} used to {{indicate}} that the call is unreachable, either because all circuits (trunks) are busy, the called number is out of service, the call is unroutable, or sometimes that an invalid code has been dialed. A PBX also often indicates an invalid extension, while dialing an invalid telephone number on the PSTN usually results in playing the triple special information tone and a <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement.</b> Many telephone companies in North America and in the United Kingdom often play the reorder tone after the reading of a <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> explaining the reason of call failure, typically when the other party fails to receive the call after ringing for several minutes. The reorder tone is sometimes confused with the busy signal because they use the same frequencies and differ only in that the busy signal's beeping sounds have a slower cadence than those of the reorder tone.|$|E
5000|$|The program's {{trademark}} {{continues to}} be the eight o'clock chime followed by a <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement,</b> spoken by Claudia Urbschat-Mingues, [...] "Hier ist das Erste Deutsche Fernsehen mit der Tagesschau" [...] ("This is First German Television with the Tagesschau"). The Tagesschau theme music has remained the same since 1956, although the arrangement has been modernized several times, most recently in 2014 by Hans Zimmer.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s, dialing 555, {{at least}} in the Washington, D.C. {{metropolitan}} area, would bring one to a sort of party line known as [...] "The Pipeline" [...] whereby one could talk with others during the several-second intervals between a repeating <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> to the effect that [...] "The number you have dialed is not a working number. Please hang up and dial again." ...|$|E
50|$|Signed on as KLBK-FM in August 1966 with 100,000 watts. Station {{founded by}} Grayson Enterprises, Inc. as an {{automated}} station. The KLBK (AM) announcers <b>recorded</b> <b>announcements</b> for the FM stations, and oversaw the tape players, and the TV engineers watched the transmitter and maintained its operation.|$|R
50|$|The {{memory of}} the Crucial Three was revived in 2004 by BBC Radio 2 DJ Mark Radcliffe whose show {{featured}} a nightly quiz of the same name, until it ended on 5 April 2007. The quiz was introduced on alternate evenings with <b>recorded</b> <b>announcements</b> by McCulloch and Cope.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in September 2005, the trams' manual {{destination}} boards {{were changed}} to multicolour LED signs conforming with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA). Also, the driver-announced destination messages {{were replaced by}} <b>recorded</b> <b>announcements.</b> Three voices with local accents were chosen to record the destination messages on the three different tram lines.|$|R
50|$|Callers {{receive a}} <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> {{describing}} the services available and when appropriate will {{be transferred to}} a call handler with an option for Welsh language who will take their details and pass them on to another person with relevant skills or will arrange {{for them to be}} called back within three hours. If a problem appears serious enough then an ambulance will be sent. Callers can stay anonymous if they wish.|$|E
50|$|The call {{is quite}} {{different}} from that of the water rail. The courtship call, again given throughout the year, is a sharp piping kyu, longer and clearer than that of the European race. The song is a series of metallic slurred shrink, shrink notes, about two per second, and repeated after a short pause. The eastern race does not respond to <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> calls of nominate R. a. aquaticus.|$|E
50|$|A reorder tone, {{sometimes}} called a fast busy signal, indicates that no transmission {{path to the}} called number is available. This can occur either because the Inter-LATA trunk is busy {{at the time of}} the call- in which case this clears in a few seconds, if one redials- or the number is temporarily out of service, due to maintenance or the number is not willing to accept calls. It is otherwise played after a <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> explaining the reason for a general call failure.|$|E
50|$|Buses {{and trains}} are {{supposed}} to have either <b>recorded</b> <b>announcements</b> or driver announcements of station stops, but these announcements are sometimes muffled, inaudible, or omitted by automated systems. In the event that automated systems are not functioning properly, the vehicle driver or conductor is to announce stops over the public address system.|$|R
5000|$|KPIG {{has strong}} {{community}} ties featuring local disc jockeys, local sponsors, local news and commentary, and the Hog Call line, a free community call-in line for leaving <b>recorded</b> <b>announcements</b> {{that will be}} played on the air. Much like newspaper classifieds, common [...] "Hog Calls" [...] are regarding items for sale or upcoming community events.|$|R

5000|$|For verbs, {{a respectful}} requestâ€”or rather a polite commandâ€”addressed {{to a group}} may be formed by using å¾¡ã€œ, {{followed}} by the masu-stem (é€£ç”¨å½¢), followed by [...] (please). For Chinese verbs (kango + suru), the prefix is generally pronounced go-, while for native Japanese verbs the prefix is pronounced o-. This is generally written in kana. The most commonly heard use is [...] (please be careful) (Chinese verb), which is used pervasively in <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> in Japan (escalators, trains and subways, turning trucks), but other verbs are also used frequently, such as [...] (please sit down) (Japanese verb).|$|E
5000|$|On 3 December 2003, {{floods and}} storms in Melbourne caused a large influx of 000 calls, which {{prevented}} some calls from being answered immediately. This caused some users interviewed by authorities {{to believe that}} they may have accidentally dialled the wrong number. A subsequent investigation recommended that a temporary <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> be implemented during extreme events to assure callers that their calls were being connected and a delay may occur. This is {{not to be confused with}} the standard [...] "You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected" [...] RVA, which was introduced in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{only one}} {{telephone}} number is usually announced, major stations typically have line hunting, {{with the same}} number being directed to any available one of several lines within the hunt group. If there are no open lines, the calling party may receive a busy signal as with an ordinary telephone call, or sometimes the special information tones followed by a <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> that [...] "all circuits are busy, please try your call again later". In this case, the line often first gives that caller a ringback tone as if the call were being completed, misleading callers to think they may have actually gotten through the swarm of other calls that sometimes flood these lines.|$|E
