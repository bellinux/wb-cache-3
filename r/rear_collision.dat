25|$|In 2010, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} 1993–2004 model year Jeep Grand Cherokees which involves the fuel tanks of these SUVs. Because the gas tanks are mounted between the bumper and rear axle, a <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> could cause the fuel tank to leak, causing a fire. The NHTSA claims that it has reports of 157 deaths resulting from fires caused by Grand Cherokees crashing. Also affected are 2002–2007 Jeep Liberty models and 1986–2001 Jeep Cherokee models, which totals about 5.1 million affected vehicles.|$|E

50|$|The force {{exerted by}} {{the seat belt}} system during a {{collision}} adapts dynamically depending upon the collision characteristics. The 'active' head restraints (standard for driver and front passenger) give enhanced protection from neck injury, especially during <b>rear</b> <b>collisions.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{customers}} have reported safety problems with the antilock brakes: after an emergency braking event, and once the driver has released the brake pedal, the brakes remain in full force for some amount of time, increasing the risk of <b>rear</b> <b>collisions.</b>|$|R

5000|$|As of to date, the G-Con test {{includes}} : 1. 55 km/h full {{frontal collision}} 2. 64 km/h frontal offset collision 3. 55 km/h side collision 4. 50 km/h <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The {{scope of}} G-Con's test covers {{a wider range}} than many country's legal requirements. For example, the U.S. NHTSA test only covers full frontal {{collision}} but does not test vehicles against an offset deformable frontal barrier. Frontal offset collision tests are a tougher to meet but are a better representation of real world collisions because it mimics the driver's instinctive reaction to swerve away from an obstacle to avoid an accident. <b>Rear</b> <b>collision</b> tests are still not a mandatory requirement by any major automotive market. EuroNCAP have yet to incorporate <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> though they are plans {{to do so in}} the future. EuroNCAP however covers side pole impact test and collisions with infant occupants.|$|E
50|$|This {{tests the}} vehicle's driver seat to {{determine}} {{effectiveness of the}} head restraints. The driver's seat is placed on a sled to mimic <b>rear</b> end <b>collisions</b> at 20 mph. <b>Rear</b> end <b>collisions</b> at low to moderate speeds typically do not result in serious injuries but they are common. In 2005 the IIHS estimated 25% of medical costs were related to whiplash injuries.|$|R
40|$|Head rests {{are aimed}} at {{preventing}} injuries to the head and neck, in particular in <b>rear</b> end <b>collisions.</b> They are not mandatory in the Netherlands {{and there are many}} designs for them. The Institute for Road Safety Research SWOV has researched the efficiency of head rests in cars using accident statistics. The prevention of whiplash injury especially is studied. The long term consequences of whiplash injury are considered. It is concluded that <b>rear</b> end <b>collisions</b> are mostly less severe accidents with almost no severe injury. Head rests are useful because they decrease the frequency of neck injury in <b>rear</b> end <b>collisions</b> by 25 %. Recommendations are presented for the use of head rests and for further research...|$|R

5000|$|A second {{unrelated}} accident {{took place}} here on 7 January 1957; {{this was another}} <b>rear</b> <b>collision.</b> This accident took place at dawn {{about half a mile}} south of the station, and was due to the driver of an Aberdeen to London express passing signals at danger in mist, even failing to notice emergency detonators set off by the signalman.|$|E
50|$|Debuted on {{the fourth}} {{generation}} Lexus LS, the next-generation Pre-Crash System (Pre-Collision in the U.S.) offers forward and rear protection. The Frontal Pre-Crash system will activate a warning buzzer and red dash lights to alert the driver if a potential hazard is detected in the vehicle's path. If the system detects a potential collision, the system will adjust steering and braking responsiveness. If a collision is determined to be unavoidable, the seatbelt pretensioners will activate, and the brakes will automatically engage to slow the vehicle. The Rear Pre-Crash system, the first active <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> safety feature in an automobile, utilizes trunk-mounted obstacle detection and warning systems; if a <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> is deemed unavoidable, sensor-equipped Pre-Crash Intelligent Headrests in the front seats will adjust position upwards up to 25 mm and forwards up to 60 mm to cradle the head during impact, reducing whiplash. The rear Pre-Crash system in the U.S. market waited for FCC regulatory approval. For 2010, the LS hybrid further incorporated an all-TFT instrument panel display, which featured {{the addition of a}} night vision capability with pedestrian detection.|$|E
50|$|The {{accident}} was a <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> {{caused by a}} signalman's error. The signalman at Welwyn Garden City, who had been fairly recently appointed to the box, became confused and accepted two trains into the same block section. The Newcastle train, arriving first, received a signal check and was slowed down to 15‒20 mph; the Leeds train consisting of 11 coaches hauled by Class K3 2-6-0 No 4009 ran into it at approximately 65 mph.|$|E

50|$|For safety, seven airbags are standard, {{including}} two front row side torso airbags, two side curtain airbags for both rows, and a driver’s knee airbag. For <b>rear</b> <b>collisions,</b> active front headrests {{designed to help}} reduce whiplash are standard as well as brake lights that flash under emergency braking. Vehicle Stability Control+ (VSC+) applies torque to the steering wheel to aid the driver in steering. A Pre-Collision System (PCS) becomes optional which includes Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA).|$|R

50|$|The {{reports that}} the cars were more prone to fires during a <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> were a simple {{combination}} of three things. First, most law enforcement agencies rely heavily on the Crown Victoria as their primary vehicle, meaning that any police-related auto accident is very likely to involve a Crown Victoria. Second, the accidents occurred {{as the result of}} the officers intentionally parking their vehicles close to active traffic to shield a stopped motorist—something most civilians would never do. Third, the impacting vehicle was often traveling at, or above, the posted legal limit (65 to 75 mph in most jurisdictions).|$|E
5000|$|Among the {{earliest}} work by Ditlow was {{the advancement of}} automobile lemon laws. [...] In the mid 1970s Ditlow {{was involved in the}} Ford Pinto <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> controversy. In 1978 Ditlow began investigation into steel-belted radial tire failures at Firestone. While the company argued before the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that the failures were a result of improper inflation by consumers, Ditlow counter-argued that the tires were being replaced on a 1:13 ratio, indicating a serious manufacturing issue. Further investigation resulted in a replacement of 8.6 million tires, which was a primary factor in the company’s financial struggles.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} {{has also}} undergone major changes, with switches {{such as the}} boot lid release being relocated from the glove box to the doors and the fitting of an electronic handbrake. All models are fitted with an eight-inch touch screen in the centre console, with keyless entry and auto-park assist also being standard across all models. Other features include a heads-up display on the windscreen, forward and <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> warning systems, blind spot monitors and a lane departure warning system, however these are not standard on all models. The VF uses an electric power steering system, rather than the hydraulic system used on previous Commodores, which is slightly more fuel-economical {{at the cost of}} steering feel.|$|E
5000|$|... 2006: Pre-collision {{system with}} Driver Monitoring System {{introduced}} in March 2006 on the Lexus GS 450h using a CCD {{camera on the}} steering column. This system monitors the driver's face to determine where the driver is looking. If the driver's head turns away from road and a frontal obstacle is detected, the system will alert the driver using a buzzer, and if necessary, pre-charge the brakes and tighten the safety belts.2006: the Lexus LS introduced an advanced pre-collision system (APCS), added a twin-lens stereo camera located on the windshield and a more sensitive radar to detect smaller [...] "soft" [...] objects such as animals and pedestrians. A near-infrared projector located in the headlights allows the system to work at night. With the adaptive variable suspension (AVS) and electric power steering, the system can change the shock absorber firmness, steering gear ratios, and torque assist to aid the driver's evasive steering measures. The lane departure warning system will make automatic steering adjustments to help ensure that the vehicle maintains its lane in case the driver fails to react. Driver Monitoring System was introduced on the Lexus LS. Rear-end pre-collision system includes a rearward-facing millimeter-wave radar mounted in the rear bumper. This system adjusts the active head restraints by moving them upward and forward {{to reduce the risk}} of whiplash injuries if an imminent <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> is detected.|$|E
5000|$|By April 2015 U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Michael Froman and Japanese Economy Minister Akira Amari —representing the {{two largest}} economies of the 12-nation TPP—were {{involved}} in bilateral talks regarding agriculture and auto parts, the [...] "two largest obstacles for Japan." [...] These bilateral accords which would open each other's [...] "markets for products such as rice, pork and automobiles." [...] In Japan [...] "rice, wheat, barley, beef, pork, dairy goods, sugar and starch crops are considered politically sensitive products {{that have to be}} protected." [...] During the two-day ministerial TPP negotiating session held in Singapore in May 2015, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and veteran negotiator, Wendy Cutler, and Oe Hiroshi of the Japanese Gaimusho held bilateral trade talks regarding one of the most contentious trade issues—automobiles. American negotiators wanted the Japanese to open their entire keiretsu structure which is the corner stone of Japanese economy and society to American automobiles. They wanted Japanese dealer networks, such as Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Mazda, to sell American cars. Oe Hiroshi responded that there are fewer American car dealerships in Japan because Japanese consumers prefer European and Japanese cars to American cars. Different vehicle safety program structures also complicate efforts at reciprocal recognition; in Japan and Europe, new vehicles are compliance-tested before they're allowed on the market. Under American laws, automakers self-certify their cars as compliant, and cars are tested only after they go on sale. Nevertheless, as of November 2015 an agreement was released whereby Japan will recognize seven U.S. vehicle safety standards as no less stringent than Japanese national standards: those for front and <b>rear</b> <b>collision,</b> flammability of interior materials, license plate lights, interior rearview mirror impact absorption, and windshield wiping, washing, and defogging systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Understanding vehicle {{occupant}} responses during real-world <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> accidents {{is very important}} in the development of appropriate safety technologies for neck injury lessening. In this study, numerical analysis of {{vehicle occupant}} responses during rear impact were conducted by using a human multi-body model, a seat finite element model and crash accelerations obtained from real-world accidents. The human multi-body model was developed based on the body characteristics of a typical Japanese male, including the outer body geometry, inertial properties of body segments and passive joint characteristics. The seat finite element model was extracted from a detailed car finite element model. A small modification was done to the seat model to deal with the rear impact simulations. The crash accelerations were obtained from the drive recorder database of <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> accidents occurred in Japan. Several crash accelerations were selected and used as input conditions during the rear impact simulations. Kinematic responses of the occupants during the accidents can be reasonably predicted by the simulations. Furthermore, different level of accelerations leads to different kinematics responses that may cause variation in injury occurrence and injury severity...|$|E
40|$|An energy {{management}} system (EMS) {{was designed to}} minimize front and <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> forces experienced by the occupants of automotive vehicles by at least 50 %. The EMS is a hydraulic damper consisting of a control valve, a pressure operated directional control valve, and a hydraulic cylinder. The system operates entirely upon the forces experienced in the collision and dissipates the energy through a 30 ° rotation of the occupant's seat back. The damper is designed to withstand the maximum collision forces resulting in front collisions at 30 mph and <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> at 11 mph. The maximum chest load on an occupant in these collisions is approximately 5, 000 lbs. A resulting maximum load of up to 13, 900 lbs is exerted on the damper. The damper is designed to dissipate half of this energy and operate at an average load of 6, 642 lbs and a corresponding pressure of 4, 550 psi. The result of this damper is a 52 % reduction in the force exerted on an occupant's chest in a front collision from 5000 lbs to 2390 lbs. by Jennifer Dawn Navarro. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|AbstractDriver's {{workload}} {{tends to}} be increased during driving under complicated traffic environments like lane-changing operation. In such cases, <b>rear</b> <b>collision</b> warning is effective for reduction of cognitive workload. On the other hand, it is pointed out that false alarm or missing alarm caused by sensor errors leads to decrease of driver trust in the warning system and it can result in low efficiency of the system. Suppose that sensor reliability information is provided in real-time. In this paper, we propose a novel warning method to increase driver trust in the system even with low sensor reliability by utilizing sensor reliability information.
