Failures in these reconstructive processes are expressed as false memories. KIBRA single nucleotide polymorphism (rs 17070145) {{has been linked to}} episodic memory performance as well as an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, the role of KIBRA rs 17070145 polymorphism (male and female CC vs. CT/TT carriers) in <b>reconstructive</b> episodic <b>memory</b> in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm was investigated in N = 219 healthy individuals. Female participants outperformed males in the free recall condition. Furthermore, a trend towards a gender x genotype interaction was found for false recognition rates. Female CT/TT carriers exhibited a lower proportion of false recognition rates for associated critical lures as compared to male CT/TT. Additionally, an association between KIBRA rs 17070145 genotype, familiarity and recollection based recognition performance was found. In trials with correct recognition of listed items CT/TT carriers showed more “remember”, but fewer “know” responses as compared to CC carriers. Our findings suggest that the T-allele of KIBRA rs 17070145 supports recollection based episodic memory retrieval and contributes to memory accuracy in a gender dependent manner.

In this paper we present the <b>Reconstructive</b> Organizational <b>Memory</b> (ROM) model is intended as a starting point to define a framework that can support the development of information technology tools that can effectively support organizational cognition. More than a collection of knowledge repositories of different natures, organizational memory is the very process of updating these repositories and applying collective experience.

40|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{consider that}} memory {{is just a}} passive information retention and retrieval capacity. Some information and experiences are encoded, stored, and subsequently retrieved in a passive way, without any control or intervention on the subject’s part. In this paper, we will defend an active account of memory according to which remembering is a mental action and not merely a passive mental event. According to the <b>reconstructive</b> account, <b>memory</b> is an imaginative reconstruction of past experience. A key feature of the reconstructive account is that given the imperfect character of memory outputs, some kind of control is needed. Metacognition is the control of mental processes and dispositions. Drawing from recent work on the normativity of automaticity and automatic control, we distinguish two kinds of metacognitive control: top-down, reflective control, on the one hand, and automatic, intuitive, feeling-based control on the other. Thus, we propose that whenever the mental process of remembering is controlled by means of intuitive or feeling-based metacognitive processes, it is an action...|$|R

50|$|People who {{experience}} negative affectivity following an event report fewer <b>reconstructive</b> false <b>memories.</b> This was evidenced by two studies conducted around public events. The first surrounded {{the events of}} the televised O.J. Simpson trial. Participants were asked to fill out questionnaires three times: one week, two months and a year after the televised verdict. These questionnaires measured participant emotion towards the verdict and the accuracy of their recalled memory of what occurred during the trial. Overall the study found that although participant response to the event outcome did not affect the quantity of remembered information, it did influence the likelihood of false memory. Participants who were pleased with the verdict of the O.J. Simpson trial were more likely to falsely believe something occurred during the trial than those who were displeased with the verdict. Another experiment found the same findings with Red Sox fans and Yankees fans in their overall memory of events that occurred in the final game of a 2004 playoff series in which the Red Sox defeated the Yankees. The study found that the Yankees fans had better memory of events that occurred than the Red Sox fans. The results from both of these experiments are consistent with the findings that negative emotion can lead to fewer memory errors and thus increased memory accuracy of events.|$|R

Promising research directions include comparing functions served by positive versus negative memories, tracking the early development of memory functions, and exploring individual and group differences.

Ordinary memories show a dimensional structure that involves all levels of autobiographical knowledge, whereas flashbulb memories appear to come from a more densely integrated region of autobiographical knowledge. Flashbulb memories and non-flashbulb memories also differ qualitatively and not just quantitatively. Flashbulb memories are considered a form of autobiographical memory but involve the activation of episodic memory, where as everyday memories are a semantic form of recollections.

The reconstructive account is supported by a series of experiments that show: a retroactive effect in which report of C 1 is enhanced by similarity to C 2; a nonword C 1 can either interfere with or enhance report of C 2, depending on how accurately C 1 is encoded; manipulation of reconstructive processes can eliminate or enhance the effect of orthographic similarity; and a bi-directional trade-off in the report of an orthographically similar C 1 -C 2 pair, whereby report of one member compromises report of the other.

Moreover, recent evidence has linked these retrieval-related effects of visual perspective to subsequent changes in memories. Here we examine how shifting visual perspective influences the accuracy of subsequent memories for complex events encoded in the lab. Participants performed a series of mini-events that were experienced from their own eyes, and were later asked to retrieve memories for these events while maintaining the own eyes perspective or shifting to an alternative observer perspective. We then examined how shifting perspective during retrieval modified memories by influencing the accuracy of recall on a final memory test. Across two experiments, we found that shifting visual perspective reduced the accuracy of subsequent memories and that reductions in vividness when shifting visual perspective during retrieval predicted these changes in the accuracy of memories. Our findings suggest that shifting from an own eyes to an observer perspective influences the accuracy of long-term memories...|$|R
