2500|$|Sandé {{said that}} the first track on the album, [...] "Heaven" [...] was a huge [...] "epic pop song" [...] which had {{sweeping}} strings. It came about when {{she was having a}} late night conversation with Naughty Boy, the song's producer with whom she worked throughout the whole album. She said that Naughty Boy had a beat <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> and then she got the first line of the song and the song began to write itself from there. She said; [...] "I love how songs like that develop: before we knew it, we were putting strings on with a synth, Naughty Boy suggested the Funky Drummer loop and it came together really organically." [...] The song was heavily compared to Massive Attack's [...] "Unfinished Sympathy", however Sandé said that she takes it as a compliment as she is a big fan of Massive Attack. However, she said lyrically or melodically the songs are not similar, but the Funky Drummer loop has been used so much and it has strings on people and that is why the connection is made between the two songs. She said she was glad if people get the same vibe from the song, as she loves the song and said the song was [...] "really exciting". Sandé said she also [...] "designed" [...] the song for a night club moment, where everyone can put their hands in the air. The song's genre featured a dubstep pop. Sandé {{said that the}} song was {{based on the fact that}} she believes in God and heaven, although she does not follow a religion. She said that what inspired her the most to write the track was her idea of heaven, which was being surrounded by music and somewhere which is very calm, and she wrote about that in [...] "Heaven".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{epidemic}} may {{be controlled}} or predicted {{if we can}} monitor the history of physical human contacts. As most people have a smart phone, a contact between two persons {{can be regarded as}} a handshake between the two phones. Our task becomes how to detect the moment the two mobile phones are close. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using the outdoor WLAN signals, provided by public Access Points, for off-line mo-bile phones collision detection. Our method does not require GPS coverage, or real-time monitoring. We designed an Android app <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> phone’s <b>background</b> to periodically collect the outdoor WLAN signals. This data are then analysed to detect the potential contacts. We also discuss sev-eral approaches to handle the mobile phone diversity, and the WLAN scan-ning latency issue. Based on our measurement campaign <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real world, we conclude that it is feasible to detect the co-location of two phones with the WLAN signals only...|$|R
