The development of logic processing components based on this idea for multiple projects implies the need to dessign and develop some common components and tasks for all of them. The purpose of this project is the dessign and development of a framework that eases the development of applications or logic modules based on the evaluation and management of <b>referenced</b> <b>operations.</b> This objective is achieved by obtaining the <b>references</b> of the <b>operations,</b> modeling the <b>referenced</b> <b>operations</b> and their relations as directed graphs and providing lookup and evaluation work ow functionalities for them. The resultant framework can be used to develop applications or modules for the evaluation of mutable operation sets and then use it to evaluate them with a single unit processing strategy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the comparison of}} four control strategies for the A²/O WWTP configuration for simultaneous C, N and P removal. The control strategies: (i) external COD-P control; (ii) external recycle flow-P control; (iii) nitrate control in the last anoxic reactor; (iv) ammonia control in the last aerobic reactor, were combined with other common control loops to build different control structures and were simulated in Matlab/Simulink under different influent conditions. A systematic approach was conducted with all the strategies to assess their potential effectiveness, according to the following steps: theoretical design, setpoint optimization and, finally, a detailed comparison of the control results against a <b>reference</b> <b>operation</b> and an optimized reference scenario. The optimization of the <b>reference</b> <b>operation</b> presented a 7 % reduction of the total operational cost. The simulation results showed that some control strategies further reduced 3 – 7. 5 % the WWTP operational costs while the effluent quality is greatly improved...|$|R

The lap “shaking hands” joints will operate under variable field, causing parasitic-induced currents in superconducting strands and temperature rise of the strands.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{based on}} an alternative scheduling approach for iterative acyclic and cyclid DFGs (data-flow graphs) with limited resources that exploits inter- and intra-iteration parallelism is presented. The method is based on guiding the scheduling algorithm with the information supplied by a scheduling-range chart. This scheduling range is relative to a <b>reference</b> <b>operation</b> and can be finite or infinite. The information in the scheduling-range chart is used during scheduling in order to optimize the sampling period. For cases where the precedence constraints do not allow a schedule in the originally selected optimal sampling period, the algorithm provides an adjustment procedure, thus always guaranteeing a solution. The delay of the processor-assignment phase increases {{the efficiency of the}} algorithm when the operations have processing times different from the unity and are nonpreemptiv...|$|R

Many techniques are now available and are selected according to the pathophysiology of incontinence. Vesical colpo-suspension is considered to be the <b>reference</b> <b>operation</b> for the surgical treatment of female stress {{urinary incontinence}} (SUI). New suburethral sling techniques have been available for several years, such as TVT SPARC, IVS or, even more recently, URATAPE. These new techniques not only allow restoration of continence, but are also minimally invasive and easily reproducible. They also facilitate re-operation in the case of failure or recurrence of incontinence. Currently, although the follow-up of these techniques is only 5 years, they ensure better management of the various types of urinary incontinence (stress, mixed and sphincter incompetence) than vesical colposuspension...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} issues of {{referencing}} and binding to objects in largescale distributed systems. Flexible binding mechanisms are necessary to support large-scale, long-running systems and applications. To assist object-oriented programs {{there is a need}} for cheap, fine-grain references, supporting objects of arbitrary type and distributed garbage collection. Support for large-scale systems includes referencing fragmented objects (groups), and federation of heterogeneous addressing mechanisms. Our object model separates logical objects from their representation atoms; binding a reference connects its source to an actual target atom; invocation calls a procedure of the bound atom. The primitive <b>reference</b> <b>operations</b> are duplication, binding, unbinding, redirecting, and invoking target. Binding may cause type-checking, instantiation of an atom and linking of the atom's class. To support programmer-defined policies, the target object may redirect the reference to any of its atoms, particularly [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of tokamak restarted with a D-shaped vacuum vessel in 1992.

The COMPASS tokamak with its size (major radius 0.6 m and {{height of the}} vessel approx. 0.7 m) ranks to smaller tokamaks capable of the H-mode operation. Importantly, due to its size and shape the COMPASS plasmas correspond to one tenth (in the linear scale) of the ITER plasmas. At present, besides COMPASS {{there are only two}} operational tokamaks in Europe with ITER-like configuration capable of regime with the high plasma confinement. It is the Joint European Torus (JET) and the German tokamak ASDEX Upgrade (Institut für Plasmaphysik, Garching, Germany). JET is the biggest experimental device of this type in the world.|$|R

40|$|Determining {{the genetic}} {{architecture}} of complex traits {{is a necessary}} step to understand phenotypic changes in natural, experimental and domestic populations. However, {{this is still a}} major challenge for modern genetics, since the estimation of genetic effects tends to be complicated by genetic interactions, which lead to changes in the effect of allelic substitutions depending on the genetic background. Recent progress in statistical tools aiming to describe and quantify genetic effects meaningfully improves the efficiency and the availability of genotype-to-phenotype mapping methods. In this contribution, we facilitate the practical use of the recently published ‘NOIA’ quantitative framework by providing an implementation of linear and multilinear regressions, change of <b>reference</b> <b>operation</b> and genotype-to-phenotype mapping in a package (‘noia’) for the software R, and we discuss theoretical and practical benefits evolutionary and quantitative geneticists may find in using proper modeling strategies to quantify the effects of gene...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to refine the BIOMATH {{calibration}} protocol for SBR systems, in particular to develop a pragmatic calibration protocol that takes advantage of SBR information-rich data, defines a simulation strategy to obtain proper initial conditions for model calibration and provides statistical evaluation of the calibration outcome.

The performance of <b>reference</b> <b>operation</b> using fixed phase length and dissolved oxygen set points and two real-time control strategies is compared to find optimal operation under dynamic conditions.
