50|$|The D21 was {{introduced}} in 1963, and was {{the largest of the}} D Series, as well as the first Allis-Chalmers tractor to exceed 100 horsepower and the largest <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> <b>tractor</b> available in the industry; rated at 103 horsepower. The D21 was styled significantly different than the other D Series with full fenders, a large platform, and a rear-mounted fuel tank which held 52 gal, allowing an average of 10 hours of field work. The D21 was not turbocharged until 1965, which pushed its horsepower up to about 128 as it remained the largest <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> <b>tractor</b> available. This gave the D21 over 15,000 pounds of pull, making it the largest tractor Allis-Chalmers had ever made, as well as the most expensive at around 10,000 dollars.|$|E
50|$|The Farmall M, {{produced}} by International Harvester under the Farmall brand from 1939 to 1952, is a <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> <b>tractor.</b> The M {{was the largest}} of International Harvester's row crop tractors during its original production.

40|$|Intra-row weeds {{constitute}} {{a major challenge}} in organic <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> and research has mainly aimed at replacing laborious hand weeding with mechanization. A number of investigations have focussed on optimising the use of thermal and mechanical methods and this paper reviews the major results achieved for horticultural and agricultural <b>row</b> <b>crops.</b> Mechanical methods, such as weed harrowing, finger weeding and torsion weeding, have provided promising results in transplants. In direct-sown <b>row</b> <b>crops,</b> however, successful weed control requires a strategy where mechanical methods applied post-emergence are preceded by pre-emergence flaming for the control of early and problematic weed cohorts. New methods, such as robotic weeding for <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> with abundant spacing between individual crop plants and band-steaming for <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> developing dense crop stands, have been introduced recently. They are seen as the future directions of new solutions for intra-row weed control in <b>row</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{ascertain}} the competitive and complementary potential of fresh vegetable production relative to traditional <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> production using a regional partial equilibrium model. It seems clear from the analysis that vegetable crops are not destined in the near future to replace <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> in terms of land utilization. Nevertheless, vegetable crops appear to compete with and complement <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> well as evidenced by substantial increases in production as market share was assumed to increase. However, fresh vegetables cannot be considered as residual enterprises to which producers move when the demand for <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> declines. Even with a simulated 20 percent decrease in the demand for <b>row</b> <b>crops,</b> the acreage of fresh vegetables did not increase. Production Economics,...|$|R
5000|$|The Farmall H, {{produced}} by International Harvester under the Farmall brand from 1939 to 1953, is a two-plow <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> <b>tractor.</b> It {{was one of}} the most widely-produced of International Harvester's [...] "letter series", with approximately 390,000 produced over the 14-year run. The H is equipped with a 4-cylinder engine with a [...] displacement and a 6-volt electrical system. The transmission contains six total gears: five forward and one reverse. It was the smaller of the two prominent row crop tractors {{produced by}} IH from the late 1930s to the early 1950s, along with the Farmall M and its variants.|$|E
50|$|The Allis-Chalmers 190XT, {{also known}} as the One-Ninety XT, is a <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> <b>tractor</b> {{produced}} by Allis Chalmers from 1964 to 1971. The tractors are powered by diesel fuel, gasoline, or LP gas (though few of the latter two were made). As its model number implies, it was based on the Allis-Chalmers D19, though it featured many alterations and improvements over the D19. The only difference between the 190 and the 190XT is the addition of a turbocharger on the 190XT diesels. Gasoline-run 190XT's also have a G2800 engine as opposed to the 190's G2500 engine. The stock 190XT is rated at about 93 drawbar horsepower.|$|E
50|$|The Farmall H, {{produced}} from 1939 to 1954 (the last two model {{years it was}} sold as the Super H, but was the same basic tractor with a slightly larger engine and disc type brakes), became the number two selling tractor model of all time in North America with 420,011 sold, (the last 28,784 being Super H's). Only the Ford 8n (due primarily to Ford's much greater economies of scale, the fact it sold for a significantly lower price, in 1952 versus $2000 for the H the same year and to its exclusive Ferguson Three Point Hitch system) was a slightly better seller, at 524,076 sold.

40|$|Experiments on {{sequential}} {{cropping systems}} were {{conducted at the}} University of Nebraska Field Research Laboratory, Mead, Nebraska on a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic, Typic Agriudol) to evaluate the production of various row crop-small grain sequences that might be used in eastern Nebraska. Three maturity classes of corn, sorghum and soybeans were grown under irrigated and nonirrigated conditions. The production and quality of grain produced by different <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> was determined. ^ Winter wheat was planted immediately after <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> harvest. Oats were planted the spring following <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> harvest. Small grain seedbed preparation was accomplished by plowing and/or discing the <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> residue to prepare an adequate seedbed while maintaining a residue cover. The effects of previous <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> on the small grain seeding operation, growth and production were determined. ^ Irrigated <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> produced larger amounts of grain than nonirrigated <b>row</b> <b>crops.</b> Variation about the mean was greater with irrigated crops as production was {{at a higher level}} than nonirrigated crops. Corn yield increased more with irrigation than sorghum and soybean yields. <b>Row</b> <b>crop</b> maturity class was related to grain production only in corn where grain yield was greater with later hybrids. Early season <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> cultivars tended to produce grain with lower test weights than full season cultivars. ^ <b>Row</b> <b>crop</b> residue did not affect the small grain seeding operation unless soil surface cover exceeded forty-five percent which occurred only following corn and sorghum and substantially slowed seeding operations. Previous <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> affected wheat stand density only when the <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> were not irrigated. Wheat stands following nonirrigated soybeans contained 15 to 20 % more seedling plants than wheat after corn or sorghum. ^ Visual vigor ratings based on ground cover and plant height of oats following nonirrigated crops, and wheat after irrigated and nonirrigated row corps, were not affected by previous <b>row</b> <b>crop.</b> Oats were more vigorous when preceded by irrigated soybeans compared with oats following irrigated corn or sorghum. Oats following soybeans had superior vigor ratings and high early dry matter production. ^ Wheat dry matter production at harvest was highest when preceded by irrigated corn. No differences in wheat dry matter production were detected when wheat was preceded by nonirrigated <b>row</b> <b>crops.</b> ^ Total nitrogen in the herbage and percent IVDMD of small grains was not influenced by preceding <b>row</b> <b>crop.</b> As small grains matured IVDMD declined. ^ Winter wheat was killed by low temperatures during the 1978 - 79 winter. Spring oat production and grain test weight were not affected by previous <b>row</b> <b>crop.</b> Moisture or temperature stress on small grains was not encountered in 1979. Grain yields averaged 21. 9 q/ha and weighed 38. 7 kg/hl. ^ Moisture and temperature stress was severe during the period of active growth of the small grains in 1980. Wheat and oats following irrigated corn and sorghum had greater yield reductions than small grains following irrigated soybeans. Wheat produced 35. 0 q/hl of grain weighing 78 kg/hl while oats produced 21. 6 q/ha of grain that weighed 41. 0 kg/hl after irrigated soybeans. Wheat and oat production after irrigated soybeans was 20 and 100 % higher than wheat and oat yields after irrigated corn or sorghum. Non-irrigated 1979 <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> had no effect on subsequent small grains in 1980. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} and compares the net returns of an organic <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> rotation to the returns {{of a conventional}} <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> rotation in the Midwest, and explores some {{of the sources of}} risk associated with organic <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> production. The study concludes modeling the optimal land use of a risk-averse producer assuming a producer is able to grow both organic and conventional <b>row</b> <b>crops.</b> The results indicate that the expected net returns of organic <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> production can be competitive with traditional corn and soybean production, however, the variation in returns can be nearly twice those of conventional production.
