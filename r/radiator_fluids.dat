However, presence of extensive scar tissue on the donor site and the recipient vessels that are located in the zone of injury are restricting factors for using free flaps in burn reconstruction.

40|$|The {{excellent}} {{dielectric properties}} of saturated (CnF(2 n+ 2)) fluorocarbons have allowed {{their use in}} direct immersion liquid cooling of electronics, for example in the Cray series supercomputers. They have also found extensive use as heat transfer media in vapour phase soldering. Their high density and optical transparency led to the suggestion by Seguinot and Ypsilantis for their use as liquid and gas radiator media for RICH detectors: such fluids have now been used in numerous particle physics and astroparticle physics experiments, {{some of which are}} highlighted. Systems to circulate and purify fluorocarbon Cerenkov <b>radiator</b> <b>fluids</b> rely on thermodynamic cycles similar to those of modern CFC-free refrigerants. Such new refrigerants - designed to disintegrate under UV in the atmosphere - are radiation-intolerant and cannot be used for direct cooling of particle detectors in demanding radiation environments such as at LHC. However pure saturated fluorocarbon molecules are extremely radiation resistant as well as being non-flammable and non-toxic. Their use as evaporative refrigerants was pioneered for the ATLAS pixel detector, leading to their choice for the cooling of the entire silicon tracker. Additionally they are used to evaporative coolants in ALICE and TOTEM and as liquid coolants in ATLAS and CMS. Ultrasonic techniques for vapour phase analysis of fluorocarbon Cerenkov radiators - developed at SLAC during the 1980 s as an inexpensive and simple alternative to UV refractometry - have found use in the petro-chemical industry, in the MOCVD (metal organic chemical vapour deposition) manufacture of semiconductors and have been successfully demonstrated with gas mixtures used in clinical anaesthesia. Such techniques are again under development for the ATLAS tracker evaporative cooling system. Examples of the thermodynamics of fluorocarbon circulation systems, together with the ultrasonic analysis technique for these fluids will be describe...|$|E

The cars were shipped with missing or inadequate <b>radiator</b> <b>fluid</b> and the train was held over during a blizzard in Chicago. When the cars arrived in California, none of them would start or could be driven; all had damaged engine blocks. They were scrapped and were a total loss, costing the company its business. This, along with a national economic downturn, brought the assembly of the Carroll Six to a halt in 1922.|$|R
50|$|Air-to-liquid {{intercoolers}} (aka Charge-Air-Coolers) are {{heat exchangers}} that transfer intake charge heat to an intermediate fluid, usually water, which finally rejects heat to the air. These systems use radiators in other locations, usually due to space constraints, to reject unwanted heat, similar to an automotive radiator cooling system. Air-to-liquid intercoolers are usually heavier than their air-to-air counterparts due to additional components {{making up the}} system (water circulation pump, <b>radiator,</b> <b>fluid,</b> and plumbing). The Toyota Celica GT-Four had this system from 1988 to 1989, 1994 to 1999, also in the Carlos Sainz Rally Championship Version from 1990 to 1993. The 1989-1993 Subaru Legacy with the 2.0 L DOHC flat-4 engine also used a top installed air-to-water intercooler on the GT and RS models sold in Japan, Europe, and Australia.|$|R
40|$|Work {{initiated}} on a common-module thermal test simulation was continued, {{and a second}} project on heat pipe simulation was begun.

Other possible solutions modeled include a radiator heater and shunting heat from the central thermal bus to the radiator. Also, module air temperature can become excessive with high avionics load. A second preoject concerning advanced heat pipe concepts was initiated. A program was written which calculates fluid physical properties, liquid and vapor pressure in the evaporator and condenser, fluid flow rates, and thermal flux. The program is directed to evaluating newer heat pipe wicks and geometries, especially water in an artery surrounded by six vapor channels.

50|$|The {{phenomenon}} of freezing-point depression has many practical uses. The <b>radiator</b> <b>fluid</b> {{in an automobile}} {{is a mixture of}} water and ethylene glycol. As a result of freezing-point depression, radiators do not freeze in winter (unless it is extremely cold, e.g. -30 to -40 C). Road salting takes advantage of this effect to lower the freezing point of the ice it is placed on. Lowering the freezing point allows the street ice to melt at lower temperatures, preventing the accumulation of dangerous, slippery ice. Commonly used sodium chloride can depress the freezing point of water to about -21 C. If the road surface temperature is lower NaCl becomes ineffective and other salts are used, such as calcium chloride, magnesium chloride or a mixture of many. These salts are somewhat aggressive to metals, especially iron, so in airports safer media such as sodium formate, potassium formate, sodium acetate, potassium acetate are used instead.|$|R

Gerard sat in fifth place, after Étancelin's engine began to overheat, which dropped him back down the field as he was forced to make successive pit stops to top up his <b>radiator</b> <b>fluid,</b> and he eventually retired on lap 22. Chiron dropped even further back after spending 45 seconds in the pits investigating the poor handling of his Talbot, and he eventually retired with a seized gearbox on lap 37. Gerard passed Bira during refuelling pit stops, his pit crew completing the task four seconds faster than Bira's. However, Louis Rosier slipped past both of them as he did not need to stop for fuel.

40|$|The Liquid Droplet Radiator is one {{of several}} {{radiator}} systems currently under investigation by NASA Lewis Research Center. It involves the direct exposure of the <b>radiator</b> working <b>fluid</b> to the space environment. An area of concern is the potential harmful effects of the low-Earth-orbit atomic oxygen environment on the <b>radiator</b> working <b>fluid.</b> To address this issue, seven candidate fluids were exposed to an oxygen plasma environment in a laboratory plasma asher. The fluids studied included Dow Corning 705 Diffusion Pump Fluid, polymethylphenylsiloxane and polydimethlsiloxane, both of which are experimental fluids made by Dow Corning, Fomblin Z 25, made by Montedison, and three fluids from the Krytox family of fluids, Krytox 143 AB, 1502, and 16256, which are made by DuPont. The fluids were characterized by noting changes in visual appearance, physical state, mass, and infrared spectra. Of the fluids tested, the Fomblin and the three Krytoxes were the least affected by the oxygen plasma.

40|$|During an Extravehicular Activity (EVA), the {{astronaut}} s metabolic {{heat and the}} heat produced by the Portable Life Support Unit (PLSS) must be rejected. This heat load is currently rejected by a sublimator, which vents up to eight pounds of water each EVA. However, for advanced space missions of the future, water venting to space needs to be minimized because resupply impacts from earth will be prohibitive. If this heat load could be radiated to space from the PLSS, which has enough surface area to radiate most of the heat, {{the amount of water}} now vented could be greatly reduced. Unfortunately, a radiator rejects heat at a relatively constant rate, but {{the astronaut}}s generate a variable heat load depending on how hard they are working. Without a way to vary the heat removal rate, the astronaut would experience cold discomfort or even frostbite. A proven method allowing a radiator to be turned-down is to sequentially allow tubes that carry the heat transfer <b>fluid</b> to the <b>radiator</b> to freeze. A drawback of current freezable radiators using this method is that they are far to heavy for use on a PLSS, because they use heavy construction to prevent the tubes from bursting as they freeze and thaw. This creates the need for a large radiator to reject most of the heat but with a lightweight tube that doesn t burst as it freezes and thaws. The new freezable radiator for the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) has features to accommodate the expansion of the <b>radiator</b> <b>fluid</b> when it freezes, and still have the high tube to fin conductance needed to minimize the number and weight of the tubes. <b>Radiator</b> <b>fluid</b> candidates are water and a propylene glycol-water mixture. This design maintains all materials within their elastic limits so that large volume changes can be achieved without breaking the tube. This concept couples this elastic expansion with an extremely lightweight, extremely high conductivity carbon fiber fin that can carry the heat needed to thaw a frozen tube. By using most of the exposed surface area of the PLSS as a radiator, the system can reject about 75 % of the highest heat load, and reduce the loss of water through sublimation by a factor of four. The proposed radiator and a small water tank can be no heavier than the current system...|$|R
30|$|Nanofluids are {{colloidal}} suspensions of nanoparticles (length scales 1 - 100 nm) in a base fluid. These particles can be metallic (Cu, Au) {{or metal}} oxides (Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, ZrO 2), carbon (diamond, nanotubes), glass or another material, with the base fluid being a typical heat-transfer fluid, such as water, light oils, ethylene glycol (<b>radiator</b> <b>fluid)</b> or a refrigerant. The base fluids alone have rather low thermal conductivities. Suspending particles in a base liquid {{to improve the}} thermal conductivity {{is not a new}} idea; previously the set back for scientists was the particle size. Manufacturing limitations in the past allowed only the creation of microparticles, and these particles quickly settled out of the fluid, and deposited in pipes or tanks, clogging flow passages, causing damage and erosion to pumps and valves, and increasing pressure drop. Nanoparticles, however, can be dispersed in base fluids and remain suspended in the fluid to a much greater extent than was previously achieved with microparticles. This is mainly thought to be due to Brownian motion preventing gravity settling and agglomeration of particles, resulting in a much more stable, suspended fluid.|$|R

40|$|This report {{discusses}} the design implications for spacecraft radiators {{made possible by}} the successful fabrication and Proof-of-concept testing of a graphite-fiber-carbon-matrix composite (i. e., carbon-carbon (C-C)) heat pipe. The proto-type heat pipe, or space radiator element, consists of a C-C composite shell with integrally woven fins. It has a thin-walled furnace-brazed metallic (Nb- 1 %Zr) liner with end caps for containment of the potassium working fluid. A short extension of this liner, at increased wall thickness beyond the C-C shell, forms the heat pipe evaporator section which is in thermal contact with the <b>radiator</b> <b>fluid</b> that needs to be cooled. From geometric and thermal transport properties of the C-C composite heat pipe tested, a specific radiator mass of 1. 45 kg/m 2 can be derived.

The report also {{discusses the}} advantage of segmented space radiator designs utilizing heat pipe elements, or segments, in their survivability to micro-meteoroid damage. This survivability is further raised by the use of condenser sections with attached fins, which also improve the radiation heat transfer rate. Since the problem of heat radiation from a fin does not lend itself to a closed analytical solution, a derivation of the governing differential equation and boundary conditions is given in appendix A, along with solutions for rectangular and parabolic fin profile geometries obtained by use of a finite difference computer code written by the author...|$|R

40|$|SINDA/FLUINT {{has been}} found to be a {{versatile}} code for modeling aerospace systems involving single or two-phase fluid flow and all modes of heat transfer. Several applications of SINDA/FLUINT are described in this paper. SINDA/FLUINT is being used extensively to model the single phase water loops and the two-phase ammonia loops of the Space Station Freedom active thermal control system (ATCS). These models range from large integrated system models with multiple submodels to very detailed subsystem models. An integrated Space Station ATCS model has been created with ten submodels representing five water loops, three ammonia loops, a Freon loop and a thermal submodel representing the air loop. The model, which has approximately 800 FLUINT lumps and 300 thermal nodes, is used to determine the interaction between the multiple fluid loops which comprise the Space Station ATCS. Several detailed models of the flow-through radiator subsystem of the Space Station ATCS have been developed. One model, which has approximately 70 FLUINT lumps and 340 thermal nodes, provides a representation of the ATCS low temperature radiator array with two fluid loops connected only by conduction through the radiator face sheet. The detailed models are used to determine parameters such as <b>radiator</b> <b>fluid</b> return temperature, fin efficiency, flow distribution and total heat rejection for the baseline design as well as proposed alternate designs. SINDA/FLUINT has also been used as a design tool for several systems using pressurized gasses.

SPA experiment operations are planned for early Shuttle flights. This paper presents thermal control study results for preliminary analysis and design definition of the APPS. A 100 /sq m, three-wing, pumped-fluid, deployable radiator with separate APPS equipment and SPA experiments coolant loops {{was selected as the}} baseline. The system is capable of rejecting the heat (approximately 26 kw) associated with the production and consumption of approximately 16 kw of electrical power produced by the APPS fuel cells for a worst case radiator orientation. For the most favorable orientation, the heat rejection and power capability approach 38 and 24 kw, respectively. Alternate approaches were evaluated, such as heat pipes for the <b>radiator</b> and alternate <b>fluids</b> for the coolant loops. Emphasis was placed on using Shuttle developed hardware: coolant pumps, heat exchangers, <b>fluids,</b> and <b>radiator</b> technology...|$|R
