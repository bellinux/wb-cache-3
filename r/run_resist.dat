40|$|Single {{crystals}} of z-cut 0. 05 % Fe:doped {{lithium niobate}} (Fe:LiNbO 3), have been etched {{in a mixture}} of HF and HNO 3 acids, under simultaneous illumination from a ~ 100 mW 488 nm wavelength Ar ion laser light source, focused to power densities of ~ 50 W cm– 2 at the crystal surface exposed to the etchant. Etching is partially inhibited in illuminated regions, and the degree of inhibition shows a systematic latency: sites illuminated early in the etch <b>run</b> <b>resist</b> further etching even after the light is removed. Etched structures additionally exhibit regular periodic features of ~ 0. 5 µm scale length. Details of these structures are shown, and the latent etching effect is discussed...|$|E

In his present frame of mind, this was a suspicious circumstance in itself. He cleared away the litter {{so as to make}} room for the introduction of his hand and arm into the drawer. In another moment his fingers touched a piece of paper, jammed between the inner end of the drawer and the bottom of the flat surface of the washhand-stand. With a little care, he succeeded in extricating the paper. Only pausing to satisfy himself that there was nothing else to be found, and to close the drawer after replacing its contents, he left the cottage.|$|R

The passes should have been all fortified, for it is among the hills that we can best cope with the heavy Roman troops. The cities best calculated for defense should have been strongly walled; preparations made for places of refuge, among the mountains, for the women and children; large depots of provisions gathered up, in readiness for the strife.

30|$|However, {{during the}} mergers and reorganizations program, owners of privately run coal mines did not {{initiate}} collective resistance in Shanxi. The {{reason was that}} they had fallen into the traps that had been arranged by the local governments: In the event that owners attempted to resist the county government’s efforts to force them to sign unfair agreements, the county government would argue that they were only carrying out the orders of the prefectural or provincial government; if owners of privately <b>run</b> coal mines <b>resisted</b> the provincial government, they might have faced extremely high resistance costs exerted by the prefectural (county) government. They were not allowed to resist within Shanxi’s provincial region because the provincial government not only had violence as an advantage, but it could also utilize the prefectural and county governments to control the owners of privately run coal mines. 17 Therefore, for the owners of privately run coal mines, the cost of protecting their property rights was very high in Shanxi, and it is difficult for the vertical constraints mechanism to be effective in constraining the local government.|$|R
5|$|Carlos Menem {{ran for a}} {{new term}} as {{president}} in 2003, and Eduardo Duhalde tried to prevent it. Instead of holding primary elections within the PJ, the 2003 elections used {{a variant of the}} Ley de Lemas. All the Peronist candidates were allowed to run in the general election, using their own tickets. Although Kirchner ran for president with Duhalde's support, he was not the president's first choice. Trying to prevent a third term for Menem, Duhalde approached Santa Fe governor Carlos Reutemann and Córdoba governor José Manuel de la Sota; Reutemann declined, and De la Sota did not run because he was insufficiently popular. Duhalde also unsuccessfully approached Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá, and Roberto Lavagna, all of whom refused to <b>run.</b> Duhalde initially <b>resisted</b> supporting Kirchner, fearing that Kirchner would ignore him if elected. Kirchner run on the Front for Victory ticket, one of the several fronts put up by the PJ. Since Kirchner was identified with the centre-left, Duhalde appointed the centre-right Daniel Scioli as his vice-presidential candidate. Only a handful of Peronist governors supported either candidate; most remained neutral, awaiting the election to forge a relationship with the victor.|$|R

30|$|The costs {{exerted by}} {{local governments are}} {{proportional}} {{to the ability of}} local governments to suppress investors and inversely proportional to the extent of favorable relations that they have with owners. Compared with the prefectural (county) government, the provincial government is more powerful when it comes to suppressing resistance. Besides this, it has a larger police force, more judicial power, more control of political and economic resources, and it can order the prefectural (county) government to take suppressive actions. Therefore, owners of privately <b>run</b> coal mines <b>resisting</b> against the provincial government means they will face more consequences than if they had resist against the prefectural (county) government. Moreover, the provincial government generally will not establish any direct relations with owners of privately run coal mines and so provincial officials are less affected when handling their resistance. In contrast, not only does the prefectural (county) government have less power to suppress any resistance, the prefectural (county) officials often have a variety of connections with the owners of privately run coal mines. Usually unless there is strong political pressure, prefectural (county) governments are generally reluctant to use any force to suppress. Therefore, compared with the provincial level of decentralization, the resistance cost exerted by local governments is greatly reduced by decentralizing to the prefectural (county) level.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Elite triathletes’ sweat {{volume and}} {{electrolyte}} losses during exercise can be detrimental {{in a warm}} environment. PURPOSE: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate urine and sweat electrolyte losses of male and female triathletes during endurance exercise in a warm environment. METHODS: Thirty five Timex sponsored triathletes (n = 20 ♂, 15 ♀: age 39 ± 12 yr, 33 ± 6 yr; height 181 ± 6 cm, 171 ± 6 cm; weight 76. 1 ± 7. 0 kg, 60. 1 ± 5. 4 kg; fast half Ironman time 4 : 30 ± 0 : 40 hr:min, 5 : 09 ± 0 : 32 hr:min, respectively) completed a 43. 4 ± 3. 8 minute treadmill <b>run</b> or friction <b>resisted</b> cycle ergometer bike at their predicted half Ironman race pace in a heated environment (28. 0 ± 0. 5 ºC, 27. 2 ± 4. 9 % relative humidity). Before exercise each subject provided a urine sample and skin fold measures were taken. Percent dehydration was calculated using pre- and post-exercise nude body weights. Whole body wash-down (WBW) was performed using distilled, deionized water to determine sweat electrolyte content. Twenty-four hour urine was collected to calculate sodium and potassium losses. Twenty-four hour diet intake was recorded to calculate net balance. RESULTS: Sweat electrolyte losses during exercise differed between genders. Men had higher sweat rates and sweat loss than women (1. 88 ± 0. 38 L·h- 1 vs 1. 34 ± 0. 36 L·h- 1, p ≤ 0. 001; 1. 39 ± 0. 31 L vs 0. 95 ± 0. 27 L, p ≤ 0. 001), respectively. Men had greater sweat sodium loss (p= 0. 004; men: 60. 3 ± 19. 9 mEq vs women: 39. 4 ± 19. 9 mEq) and a greater rate of sweat sodium loss (p= 0. 010; 82. 4 ± 26. 6 mEq·hr- 1 vs women: 56. 5 ± 30. 1 mEq·hr- 1). Concentrations of sweat sodium and potassium did not differ between genders. Men had higher urine sodium mass than women (196. 2 ± 80. 1 mEq vs 117. 5 ± 49. 5 mEq, respectively, p= 0. 002). Net Balance differences were not found between male and female intake and loss of fluid and electrolytes. During the 24 hour dietary consumption, women consumed less water than men (3. 026 ± 1. 216 L vs 4. 594 ± 2. 824 L, respectively, p= 0. 036) and Na+ content (3588. 7 ± 1004. 7 mg vs 5081. 2 ± 2277. 2 mg, respectively, p= 0. 017). CONCLUSION: Sweat volume, electrolyte loss, urinary sodium loss and diet intake differed between male and female elite triathletes. When determining fluid and sodium replacement requirements in warm conditions for high level triathletes, men may need to replace more fluids and sodium at greater rates than women to remain homeostatic...|$|R
