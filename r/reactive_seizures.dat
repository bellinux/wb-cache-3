40|$|Seizures occur more {{frequently}} early in life. Some {{of these early}} seizures may eventually become epilepsy. Others are <b>reactive</b> <b>seizures</b> due to excessive environmental stimuli that, in any other age group, might not have elicited a similar response. To understand the developmental aspects of seizures and epilepsy in humans, {{it is important to}} study these processes in animals of equivalent ages. In this paper, we describe several animal models of developmental seizures, including their electroclinical manifestations and their validity in respect to human epileptic syndromes. There are sever-al factors that may account for the increased seizure susceptibility of the immature brain, including the delayed develop-ment of effective systems or synaptic networks that are involved in the suppression of seizures. A better insight of the basic pathophysiology of seizures as a function of age in animal models will lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of age-specific epileptic disorders in humans. (J Child Neurol 1994; 9 (Suppl) :S 3 -S 11). The epilepsies constitute a large group of neurologic dis-eases with an incidence of 0. 5 % to 1 % in the general popu-lation. â€™ In contrast to <b>reactive</b> <b>seizures,</b> which occur in response to environmental changes (hypoglycemia, fever, drug or alcohol withdrawal), epileptic seizures occur a...|$|E
40|$|Sarah A Moore Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA Abstract: Seizures are {{a common}} {{presenting}} complaint in cats, although causes and options {{for the treatment of}} seizures in this species have been historically poorly described in the veterinary literature. Seizure manifestation in cats may be different than what is typically seen in dogs, but the underlying causes of seizure activity are the same. These include primary epilepsies, structural epilepsies, and <b>reactive</b> <b>seizures.</b> Although primary epilepsy was once believed to be rare in cats, we now commonly appreciate this syndrome, albeit at a lower frequency than in dogs. Because of this, a complete diagnostic work-up is recommended for all cats presenting for initial evaluation of seizures. Symptomatic treatment of seizures in cats is similar to dogs, with only a few limitations related to species-specific antiepileptic drug toxicities. The goal of this review is to summarize the recent veterinary literature related to feline seizures, with a focus on seizure classification, clinical manifestation, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment options.

40|$|The {{aetiology}} {{and outcome}} of dogs with juvenile-onset seizures were investigated. One hundred and thirty-six dogs whose first seizure occurred {{before the age}} of one year were investigated. One hundred and two dogs were diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy (IE), 23 with symptomatic epilepsy (SE), nine with <b>reactive</b> <b>seizures</b> (RS) and two with probable symptomatic epilepsy (pSE). The outcome was known in 114 dogs; 37 per cent died or were euthanased as a consequence of seizures. The mean survival time of this population of dogs was 7. 1 years. Factors that were significantly associated with survival outcome included the diagnosis of SE and the number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used before investigation. The use of one AED before investigation and a diagnosis of SE were associated with a negative outcome, whereas receiving no AED medications before referral was associated with a longer survival. For dogs with IE, survival time was shortened if the dog was a border collie or with a history of status epilepticus;receiving no AEDs before referral in the IE group was associated with a positive outcome. Seizure-free status was achieved in 22 per cent of dogs diagnosed with IE. While the survival times were longer than previously reported in canine epilepsy, similar remission rates to those reported in childhood epilepsy, where a 70 per cent remission rate is documented, were not seen in the canine juvenile population...|$|E

[...] <b>Reactive</b> epileptic <b>seizures</b> are caused by metabolic issues, such as low blood sugar or kidney or liver failure.

40|$|This article {{outlines}} the consensus proposal on diagnosis of epilepsy in dogs by the International Veterinary Epilepsy Task Force. The {{aim of this}} consensus proposal is to improve consistency in the diagnosis of epilepsy in the clinical and research settings. The diagnostic approach to the patient presenting {{with a history of}} suspected epileptic seizures incorporates two fundamental steps: to establish if the events the animal is demonstrating truly represent epileptic seizures and if so, to identify their underlying cause. Differentiation of epileptic seizures from other non-epileptic episodic paroxysmal events can be challenging. Criteria {{that can be used to}} make this differentiation are presented in detail and discussed. Criteria for the diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy (IE) are described in a three-tier system. Tier I confidence level for the diagnosis of IE is based on a history of two or more unprovoked epileptic seizures occurring at least 24 h apart, age at epileptic seizure onset of between six months and six years, unremarkable inter-ictal physical and neurological examination, and no significant abnormalities on minimum data base blood tests and urinalysis. Tier II confidence level for the diagnosis of IE is based on the factors listed in tier I and unremarkable fasting and post-prandial bile acids, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (based on an epilepsy-specific brain MRI protocol) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Tier III confidence level for the diagnosis of IE is based on the factors listed in tier I and II and identification of electroencephalographic abnormalities characteristic for seizure disorders. The authors recommend performing MRI of the brain and routine CSF analysis, after exclusion of <b>reactive</b> <b>seizures,</b> in dogs with age at epileptic seizure onset 6 years, inter-ictal neurological abnormalities consistent with intracranial neurolocalisation, status epilepticus or cluster seizure at epileptic seizure onset, or a previous presumptive diagnosis of IE and drug-resistance with a single antiepileptic drug titrated to the highest tolerable dose. This consensus article represents the basis for a more standardised diagnostic approach to the seizure patient. These recommendations will evolve over time with advances in neuroimaging, electroencephalography, and molecular genetics of canine epileps...|$|E
