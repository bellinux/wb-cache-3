In the UK franchising accounts for approximately one-third of all retail sales (Franchise Survey, 2003). This paper explores the implications of franchising on the intellectual capital (IC) development and knowledge management (KM) for <b>retail</b> <b>organisations,</b> given that for <b>retail</b> <b>organisations</b> asset intangibility is a particular feature. As such, this paper breaks new ground in engaging currently topical concepts from leading-edge debates in the management literature (IC and KM) to examine franchising in service sector businesses. The paper should hold considerable interest for, not only academics interested in franchising per se, but also business researchers examining fields such as innovation and intangible asset growth. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{response}} to stakeholder expectations from corporate social responsiblity (CSR), many firms create written policies about principles of social {{responsibility to be}} applied in their corporate activities. In this book, {{it is suggested that}} CSR could be integrated as part of the firm's marketing strategies. The perspective is that of a <b>retail</b> <b>organisation.</b> The retailer not only has immediate contact with consumers, but is also directly influenced by what is happening at the supplier sites where their products are manufactured. Today, several retailers communicate their CSR activities to consumers, but how do these retailers manage their CSR in their own organisation and in their relationships with the suppliers of the retail brand products? Existing theories on CSR, retailing and channel management are assembled to provide useful guidance on how to work with CSR in a <b>retail</b> <b>organisation</b> and in its relationships with suppliers. A framework with input from an empirical study of one Swedish and one British leading food retailer, expressing an ambition to be socially responsible, is suggested for the analysis of CSR in a <b>retail</b> <b>organisation</b> and in relationship with suppliers of retail brand products.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} an on-going programme {{of research}} that investigates the use of Geographical Information (GI) in retail locational decision-making. The continued pressures facing UK multiple <b>retail</b> <b>organisations</b> are such that decisions regarding the location of outlets are of significant importance. These locations represent sites where significant amounts of retail capital are 'sunk'. Once taken, decisions regarding the location of outlets cannot be easily altered. In order to assess the current role and use of GI in locational decision-making a three-stage approach has been adopted and is reported here. First, exploratory research was undertaken to assess decision-makers' use and awareness of the geographic nature of one particular type of GI. Secondly, a detailed postal survey was distributed to those responsible for locational decisions. This recorded a 36 per cent response rate and is {{the main focus of}} this paper. Thirdly, detailed case study research is proposed in three multiple <b>retail</b> <b>organisations.</b> It is envisaged that the results thus generated will provide a richer understanding of the nuances of retail locational decision-making. ...|$|R

40|$|In sectors {{like the}} Retail, where margins {{are small and}} the {{turnover}} rate is high, information is {{necessary in order to}} have competitive advantage. Business Intelligence can deliver such information in time. This research focuses on the use of Business Intelligence in the Dutch Retail sector. The main research question is: How is Business Intelligence used in the Dutch retail sector and how will it be used in the future? From theory on steering of processes it comes true that information is necessary in order to steer effectively. Therefore Business Intelligence can play a role in this steering. A good model to determine the Business Intelligence maturity of an organisation is the Business Intelligence Maturity Matrix, which distinguishes four levels of maturity (local, coordinated, integral and intelligent) at the dimensions BI-ambition, BI-organisation and BI-architecture. The retail sector is very extensive. A distinction can be made between food and fashion retail. The processes of <b>retail</b> <b>organisations</b> can be divided in primary and secondary processes, but the most important process in <b>retail</b> <b>organisations</b> is the integration of these processes. Therefore integral information is needed, which can be delivered by Enterprise wide Business Intelligence. Trends in the retail sector are: ongoing innovation, supply chain integration and increasing complexity. These influence the use of Business Intelligence. Because of the trend supply chain integration, <b>retail</b> <b>organisations</b> need chain wide Business Intelligence in order to get information about the whole chain. When this is realised the whole chain from suppliers to customers can be optimised. This will lead to cost reductions and increased sales. In order to see if Business Intelligence is used this way in the Dutch Retail sector, empirical research towards the usage and maturity of Business Intelligence is done in ten Dutch <b>retail</b> <b>organisations.</b> These organisations are both from the food and fashion retail sectors. The results of this research are as follows. The average Business Intelligence maturity level of these ten organisations is coordinated. There is a correlation between the three factors of the Business Intelligence Maturity Matrix and also between the maturity and usage level of Business Intelligence. There is no significant difference between food and fashion retailers in the usage and maturity of Business Intelligence. The use of Business Intelligence is higher in primary processes than the secondary processes. Only two organisations use Business Intelligence in the integration of processes. Business Intelligence is mostly used for reporting and OLAP. The maturity and usage of Business Intelligence at the Dutch Retail sector is not sufficient to fulfil the trends in the retail sector. In order to be ready for chain wide Business Intelligence, it is necessary to have an integral Business Intelligence system. Therefore the Dutch <b>Retail</b> <b>organisations</b> have to evolve their Business Intelligence to an integral system. Also the usage of the system has to be stimulated. And in the last place the relation with the other parties has to be strengthened. When they can realise this, the organisation is ready for chain wide Business Intelligence. Cost reductions, competitive advantage and increasing sales will be the result...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{most of the}} {{commentary}} {{on the impact of}} the Internet on retail marketing has been anecdotal, offering exaggerated speculative forecasts of its future potential. One view contends that the Internet will become a major new retail format, replacing the traditional dominance of fixed location stores. However, little academic research exists to either disprove or support the claims of Internet penetration by retailers. Seeks to redress the balance by presenting a comprehensive and rigorous review of UK retailer Internet activities. A sampling frame of 1, 099 UK retail multiples was used, and each Web site individually inspected to categorise the range of marketing functions and services offered. The findings indicated that, despite the hype, the majority of <b>retail</b> <b>organisations</b> surveyed have not yet registered a Web site address. Moreover, of those <b>retail</b> <b>organisations</b> that have developed a Web site, the vast majority are using it primarily as a communication tool to promote corporate or product information to Internet users, rather than to support direct sales. In conclusion, summarises the implications of these current levels of Internet activity for the future of retail marketing...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Retailers {{are facing}} {{pressure}} to promote sustainable consumption. Building on literature {{about the role}} of retailers as “translators” of the sustainability discourse, this article studies how retailers cope with this pressure. Design/methodology/approach: This study focuses on the Swedish retail sector. In twenty-two interviews with retail representatives and thirteen store observations it explores the way food retailers approach sustainable consumption, particularly focussing on the role retail stores receive in operationalizing sustainable consumption. Findings: The retail store is identified as important organizational layer within retailers to operationalize sustainable consumption. However, retailers do not acknowledge this potential sufficiently. An idealised model of multi-layered sensemaking to successfully promote sustainable consumption is presented. Research limitations/implications: The study results only cover {{a small part of the}} entire <b>retail</b> <b>organisation</b> and only provide a snapshot in time of their working. Future research should study how the internal process of translating sustainability to the market develops over time and how it is connected to different parts of the <b>retail</b> <b>organisation</b> (e. g. marketing, HR). More research is also necessary to specify the division of responsibilities between HQs and stores. Practical implications: This article proposes a divide of responsibilities between headquarters and the individual store to better deal with societal pressures and market demand. Originality/value: The results of this study add depth to the theoretical notions of ‘translation’ and ‘sensemaking’ in retailers’ efforts to promote sustainable consumption. A model for how this process works is provided...|$|E
