50|$|Unlike the Stretch dolls which {{contained}} a syrup-like liquid inside a <b>rubber</b> <b>sheath,</b> Vac-Man (and associated models like the Vac-Pac {{which were the}} heroic enemies of Vac-Man) contained a grainy solid, produced from ground-up corn cobs. By attaching the provided pump to a socket on Vac-Man's head, air could be sucked out until the body became rigid. It could then be stretched, but unlike Stretch Armstrong, it would retain its stretched shape until air was let back in.|$|E

25|$|Milk is {{extracted}} from the cow's udder by flexible <b>rubber</b> <b>sheaths</b> known as liners or inflations that are surrounded by a rigid air chamber. A pulsating flow of ambient air and vacuum {{is applied to the}} inflation's air chamber during the milking process. When ambient air is allowed to enter the chamber, the vacuum inside the inflation causes the inflation to collapse around the cow's teat, squeezing the milk out of teat in a similar fashion as a baby calf's mouth massaging the teat. When the vacuum is reapplied in the chamber the flexible rubber inflation relaxes and opens up, preparing for the next squeezing cycle.|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} {{improvements}} {{were ordered to}} be made to the aircraft {{as a result of the}} deficiencies discovered during the trials, but only a few of them were able to be implemented before production began as the VVS was very anxious to get modern fighters into service. These included an additional air intake on the starboard side of the nose for the oil cooler, <b>rubber</b> <b>sheaths</b> around the fuel tanks to make them self-sealing, two underwing bomb racks each capable of carrying a [...] FAB-100 bomb, a PBP-1 gunsight and each ShKAS was given 375 rounds and the UBS 300 rounds. From the ninth aircraft onwards the side-opening canopy was replaced by a rear-sliding canopy that could be jettisoned in flight. On 9 December 1940 the first 100 I-200s were designated as the MiG-1 (after the initials of Mikoyan and Gurevich).|$|R
50|$|The {{breathing}} bag is square with rounded corners, on his chest, exposed. Its absorbent canister is cylindrical with flat ends, crosswise on his belly, in a <b>rubber</b> <b>sheath.</b> It has a loop of wide corrugated breathing tubes; {{one of them}} originates {{at each end of}} the canister; the right tube has a side connection to let gas in and out of the {{breathing bag}} as he breathes. It has two long thin oxygen cylinders lengthwise on his back. It can be supplied with a mouthpiece with a neck strap; the mouthpiece has a valve on its front to close the breathing tubes when the mouthpiece is not in his mouth. Its dive duration is about 3 hours.|$|E
5000|$|A tweezer clamp {{consists}} of two short lengths of metal, no more than 5 - 10 cm (2 - 4 in) in length. The two lengths are fixed together {{at one end and}} open at the other end (just like a regular tweezer). The open ends are curved slightly to improve their ability to grip the nipple. Typically, they have a small 1 cm <b>rubber</b> <b>sheath</b> over this end to protect the nipple from damage and reduce slippage. A small ring wraps around the two pieces of metal and is used to adjust the tension. The user places {{the two sides of the}} metal head either side of the nipple, then by sliding the ring along the clamp shaft towards the nipple, causes the two halves to close tighter together. Tension can thus be adjusted depending on the location of the ring [...] - [...] the closer the ring is along the shaft toward the nipple, the tighter the clamp.|$|E
5000|$|Robby's bulky {{barrel-shaped}} torso (a sly {{reference to}} Bob Kinoshita's earlier {{job as a}} washing machine designer) featured a front panel fitted with a rectangular flap at the top (into which samples of any substance could be inserted for Robby to analyse and replicate); underneath the slot were two rotating discs fitted with small flashing lights and below that a row of five buttons that moved in and out. Robby's thick, stubby arms were connected to his body with plastic ball-joints that fitted into matching sockets in the torso, allowing the joints {{a small amount of}} rotational movement. The arms could also be slightly extended and this section was covered with a concertina-type tubular <b>rubber</b> <b>sheath.</b> Robby's three-fingered hands were also made of rubber, finished with metallic paint. The chest section attached to the leg section with special locking clips. The bottom section of the suit hinged {{at the top of the}} legs, allowing Robby to both bend forward and swing each leg backward and forward slightly enabling him to walk with relative ease (albeit with rather small and stiff steps). Robby's legs were made from interlocking globes of vacuum-formed plastic which were connected by internal jointing that permitted the entire leg to bend slightly but cleverly concealed the movement of the hips and knees of the human operator inside.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{integrate}} primary equipment to digitized integrated substation systems; the digitizing procedure of instrument transformers is essential. In this paper, we describe {{design and construction}} and test procedure of a line post insulator that monitors (&Records) current and voltage information of 20 kV overhead distribution lines. In the equipment a voltage and current sensor are attached to an epoxy resin molded insulator with silicon <b>rubber</b> <b>sheaths.</b> Voltage on overhead line is detected by a special arrangement of resistive divider and a low signal current transformer detects current on overhead line. Voltage and current signals are monitored with 7 -segment digital module by radio remote control. Equipment has analogue output terminals too for connect to RTU. Voltage and current information are recorded for long-time operation examination such as data logger systems. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed equipment measures ranging from 0 up to 24 kV and 0 to 500 A, then experimental results are presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{difference}} in expansion characteristics between rubber and braided stainless steel brake lines {{is a result}} of differences in hose construction. Where rubber hoses typically consist of a rubber inner hose wrapped in a textile reinforcement braid then covered in an additional <b>rubber</b> outer <b>sheath,</b> braided stainless steel hoses typically consist of a TeflonÂ® or generic PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) inner hose wrapped in a braid consisting of stainless steel wire. The stainless wire braid more effectively resists expansion due to pressure inside the hose core. This improves brake system effectiveness by more directly transferring operator input (hydraulic pressure) to brake friction surfaces. While available without a coating, the stainless braid is typically coated or covered with a clear or colored material such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) to protect the wire and inner hose from the elements and chemicals, to protect the vehicle or machine from abrasion, and for an improved appearance. Coated braided stainless steel hoses have the same essential construction as rubber hoses in terms of an inner hose wrapped in a braid followed by an outer layer, but the different materials in the braided stainless steel hoses offer substantially different and arguably better characteristics. To more thoroughly explain why, it is helpful to understand the basics of a hydraulic brake system.|$|R

There are shown difference in the temperature distribution along the radius of the finished product {{in the presence of}} an air gap between the conductor and the <b>rubber</b> <b>sheath.</b> Also, due to the need to change process parameters with possible loose contacts inside the cable. Such as the temperature of the heating surface, feeding speed and dwell time in the oven...|$|E
40|$|Eye plaque {{brachytherapy}} {{has been}} developed and refined for the last 80 years, demonstrating effective results {{in the treatment of}} ocular malignancies. Current dosimetry techniques for eye plaque brachytherapy (such as TLD- and film-based techniques) are time consuming and cannot be used prior to treatment in a sterile environment. The measurement of the expected dose distribution within the eye, prior to insertion within the clinical setting, would be advantageous, as any errors in source loading will lead to an erroneous dose distribution and inferior treatment outcomes. This study investigated the use of spectroscopic dosimetry techniques for real-time quality assurance of I- 125 based eye plaques, immediately prior to insertion. A silicon detector based probe, operating in spectroscopy mode was constructed, containing a small (1 mm 3) silicon detector, mounted within a ceramic holder, all encapsulated within a <b>rubber</b> <b>sheath</b> to prevent water infiltration of the electronics. Preliminary tests of the prototype demonstrated that the depth dose distribution through the central axis of an I- 125 based eye plaque may be determined from AAPM Task Group 43 recommendations to a deviation of 6 % at 3 mm depth, 7 % at 5 mm depth, 1 % at 10 mm depth and 13 % at 20 mm depth, with the deviations attributed to the construction of the probe. A new probe design aims to reduce these discrepancies, however the concept of spectroscopic dosimetry shows great promise for use in eye plaque quality assurance in the clinical setting...|$|E
40|$|Background: Bronchoscopic {{procedures}} {{are associated with}} costs for purchasing and maintaining the equipment. Significant share of bronchoscopy unit budget represent costs of repairs for damaged bronchoscopes which are supposedly higher in the teaching centers. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine frequency, sort and cause of bronchoscope damages as well as costs of repair. Methods: We retrospectively studied frequency, sort, cause and repair costs of bronchoscope damages for 13 new bronchoscopes, which were introduced in a program between August 1, 2001 and December 31, 2006. Results: We registered 47 bronchoscope damages during the study, which represents 1 damage per 141. 6 procedures. 6 (12. 7 %) damages were potentially preventable with more careful approach. The most frequent wear and tear injury was <b>rubber</b> <b>sheath</b> injury on the distal bending portion of flexible bronchoscope and the most frequent preventable injury was the damage of the working channel of the bronchoscope. Repair costs amounted to 34, 950. 00 EUR, which means 5. 25 EUR per procedure. We could spare mostly 17, 781. 00 EUR with more attentive work. Application of the bronchoscopes for educational purposes was not associated with higher rate of bronchoscope damages at our institution. Conclusions: Repair costs represent a significant share of bronchoscopy unit budget. We demonstrated that only a smaller number of bronchoscope damages in our unit are potentially preventable, but they still represent an important amount of expenses. Relatively small share of preventable damages during regular program and teaching procedures is attributable to a good bronchoscopy training programme, which is attended future bronchoscopists in our institution. </p...|$|E
