The original {{meaning of the word}} [...] "neuron" [...] in Greek is [...] "vegetable fiber" [...] and recent research has shown that most of the microorganism plant communication processes are neuron-like. Plants also communicate via volatiles when exposed to herbivory attack behavior, thus warning neighboring plants. In parallel they produce other volatiles to attract parasites which attack these herbivores. In stress situations plants can overwrite the genomes they inherited from their parents and revert to that of their grand- or great-grandparents.|$|E

However, the titer of introduced phage suspensions measurably decreased, and after seven days of treatment we could not detect phages in any of the samples. Nevertheless, demonstration of the translocation ability of these phages could serve as a basis for further investigations that may promote the more efficient application of bacteriophages for the control of fire blight...|$|E

40|$|A {{four-year}} {{trial was}} set up to test the feasibility of growing oleic sunflower in a very strongly saline wasteland with drip irrigation in the Ningxia plain of Northwest China. The soil salinity expressed as electrical conductivity of the saturation paste extract (EC (e)) was around 28 dS/m, and soil nutrient was deficient in the upper 120 cm depth. The experiment included five soil matric potential (SMP) treatments, with the SMP at 20 -cm depth immediately under the emitters maintained to be higher than - 5, - 10, - 15, - 20 and - 25 kPa after sunflower establishment. Drip irrigation consistently created a favourable soil moisture and low-salinity region in the root zone when the SMP was maintained higher than - 25 kPa. The sunflower dry seed yield decreased by 3. 8 % for each unit increase in seasonal average soil salinity in the <b>root</b> <b>zone.</b> <b>Plant</b> vegetative growth, yield characteristics, irrigation frequency and irrigation amount all increased with the increase in SMP from - 25 to - 5 kPa, and the highest irrigation water use efficiency was available when the SMP was between - 10 and - 15 kPa (the amount of applied water was around 750 mm). Leaching of salts by drip irrigation gradually turned the very strongly saline soil into a moderately saline soil. This research suggests that drip irrigation can be successfully used in oleic sunflower cultivation in this highly saline soil and a SMP threshold between - 10 and - 15 kPa is suggested for irrigation scheduling...|$|E

This study aimed {{to compare the}} effects of mulching with inorganic (round gravel, RG), organic (wood chips, WC), and living (manila turf grass, MG) materials on soil properties at 0 - 5 -cm and 5 - 10 -cm depths, {{as well as on}} the growth and physiological features of Osmanthus fragrans L. 'Rixianggui' plants. Soil samples were collected at three different time points from field plots of O. fragrans plants treated with the different mulching treatments. Moisture at both soil depths was significantly higher after mulching with RG and WC than that in the unmulched control (CK) treatment. Mulching did not affect soil bulk density, pH, or total nitrogen content, but consistently improved soil organic matter. The available nitrogen in the soil increased after RG and WC treatments, but decreased after MG treatment during the experimental period. Mulching improved plant growth by increasing root activity, soluble sugar, and chlorophyll a content, as well as by providing suitable moisture conditions and nutrients in the <b>root</b> <b>zone.</b> <b>Plant</b> height and trunk diameter were remarkably increased after mulching, especially with RG and WC. However, while MG improved plant growth at the beginning of the treatment, the 'Rixianggui' plants later showed no improvement in growth. This was probably because MG competed with the plants for water and available nitrogen in the soil. Thus, our findings suggest that RG and WC, but not MG, improved the soil environment and the growth of 'Rixianggui' plants. Considering the effect of mulching on soil properties and plant growth and physiology, round gravel and wood chips appear to be a better choice than manila turf grass in 'Rixianggui' nurseries. Further studies are required to determine the effects of mulch quality and mulch-layer thickness on shoot and root growths...|$|E
30|$|The EC {{value of}} the river water ranges from 34, 800 to 109.4  μS/cm during wet period, while it varies from 57, 300 to 253  μS/cm during dry period. The samples {{collected}} from or near the Bay of Bengal (Sea)/estuarine, the value of EC both in dry and wet periods is very high. These values {{can be considered as}} extreme values. In general, the EC value in dry period is higher compared to that in the wet period. This is due to more sea-water intrusions into country side for decreased upstream flow. According to Bangladesh standard, 25 samples in the wet period and 12 samples in the dry period are within the permissible limit for irrigated agriculture (Table  2; Appendix 1 and Appendix 2; Fig.  2). In this context, it can easily be concluded that in terms of EC value, most of the river water is suitable for irrigation during wet period, while it is inappropriate without any treatment during dry period (UCCC 1974). In addition to EC, {{it is also important to}} consider the TDS in surface water. Many of the toxic solid materials may be dissolved in the water which may cause harm to the plants (Matthess 1982). As EC and TDS values are interrelated and can be calculated by equation, both the values are indicative of the intensity of salinity of water in the absence of non-ionic dissolved components (Michael 1992). The applied irrigated water to the soil introduces and increases salt contents into the <b>root</b> <b>zone.</b> <b>Plant</b> roots use water and very little salts from the soil solution. When water evaporates from the soil surface, the salts remain in the root zone. As a result in the gradual accumulation of salts in the root zone causes of salinity hazards, water deficiency, toxicity, and other problems (FAO 2007). The suitability of water for irrigation depends on the presence of total amount of salts. In addition to that the kind of salts and the type of crops are also important. Various soil and cropping problems develop as the total salt content increases, and special management practices may be required to attain crop yields at desired level (FAO 2007). It needs continuous monitoring to manage the high saline water for irrigation. Practices which aid in remedying salinity problems are the leaching. Leaching means diluting high salinity water with low salinity water to leach the excess salts from the soil with excess water.|$|E

40|$|A newly Integrated Hydrological Modelling System, IHMS {{has been}} {{developed}} to study the impact of possible climate change, change in land use and change in water management on groundwater and seawater intrusion into coastal areas. The system comprises three models combined, but can also run separately. This system is designed to represent the way that integrated water management should work i. e. the impact of change in climate, change in land use and change in abstraction on stream/river flows, drainage flow, groundwater flow, groundwater levels and seawater intrusion in coastal areas. The system comprises three packages: the DiCaSM, MODFLOW (96 and 2000) and SWI models. In addition to estimating all water balance components, the Distributed Catchment Scale Model DiCaSM, produces the recharge data that are used as input to the groundwater flow model of the US Geological Survey, MODFLOW. The latter would subsequently produce the head distribution and groundwater flows that are used as input to the Sea Water Intrusion model, SWI. Therefore, any changes in land use, rainfall, water management, abstraction, etc. at the surface will be first dealt with by DiCaSM and subsequently by MODFLOW and then by SWI. The three models operate at different spatial and temporal scales and a facility (interface utilities between models) to aggregate/disaggregate input/output data to meet a desired spatial and temporal scale was developed allowing smooth and easy communication between the three models. Since the two models MODFLOW and SWI are published and are in the public domain, this paper {{will focus on the}} newly developed unsaturated zone distributed catchment scale, DiCaSM model as well as the interfacing utilities between the three models. The newly developed, DiCaSM model simulates the hydrological processes of rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, infiltration, soil water movement in the <b>root</b> <b>zone,</b> <b>plant</b> water uptake, crop growth, stream flow and groundwater recharge. The model requires distributed input data sets of rainfall, land use, soil types and digital terrain information. The model accepts either distributed or non-distributed climate data. DiCaSM produces distributed and time series output of all water balance components such as potential evapotranspiration, actual evapotranspiration, rainfall interception, infiltration, plant water uptake, transpiration, soil water content, soil moisture deficit, groundwater recharge rate, stream flow and surface runoff. This paper focuses on the details of the hydrological processes and the relevant equations used in DiCaSM as well its interfaces to the MODFLOW and SWI models. In addition, the paper reports preliminary limited tests of the DiCaSM model related to the ability of the model to predict soil moisture of surface and subsurface soil layers as well as groundwater levels. The latter demonstrates how the groundwater recharge calculated from DiCaSM can be used as input into the ground water model MODFLOW using aggregation and disaggregation algorithms (built into the interface utility). SWI has also been run successfully with hypothetical examples and was able to reproduce the results of some of the original examples of Bakker and Schaars (2005). In the subsequent papers, examples of applications on different catchments will be reported. ...|$|E

However, range expansion becomes a disadvantage when plants become disconnected from organisms that control enemies in the new range. Here, we examined nematode control in the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of range-expanding <b>plant</b> species and congeneric natives. In a greenhouse, we determined bottom-up (by the plants) and top-down (by natural enemies of the nematodes) control of two root-feeding nematode species (Helicotylenchus pseudorobustus and Meloidogyne hapla) in the rhizospheres of two range-expanding plant species, Centaurea stoebe and Geranium pyrenaicum, and two congeneric natives, Centaurea jacea and Geranium molle. Pots with plants growing in sterilized soil were inoculated with either a microbial soil community from the newly colonized natural habitat, a mixture of native microbial nematode antagonists, {{or a combination of}} these two communities. We tested the hypotheses that bottom-up control of root-feeding nematodes would be strongest in the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of range expanders and that top-down control would be strongest in the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of native <b>plant</b> species. We observed profound intra- and interspecific differences in bottom-up and top-down control among all four plant species.

40|$|The {{emission}} of methane from rice fields {{is the difference}} between the amount produced in the anaerobic zone below the soil and the amount oxidized in the <b>root</b> <b>zone.</b> <b>Plants</b> can also contribute to methane production by exuding organic compounds that may be utilized by methanogenic bacteria. We measured methane emissions from rice fields at Tu Zu in China between 1988 and 1994, which gave average emissions of about 30 mg m⁻² h⁻¹. We estimate that 45 - 60 % of the methane produced was oxidized before reaching the atmosphere; and root exudates may have contributed of the order of 10 % of the methane that was produced. The fraction of methane oxidized is low compared to experimental studies at other locations (60 - 85 %). At Tu Zu, methane production is enhanced by continuously flooded fields and the use of large amounts of organic fertilizers; in addition, the lower oxidation rate may also contribute to the higher methane emissions observed compared to other locations. In the past, most of the attention has been devoted to the factors that affect methane production and transport, but it seems that the factors that affect methane oxidation are equally important in determining the flux, if not more so.

40|$|Two {{different}} irrigation regimes {{with two}} different salinity levels {{were applied to}} peppers (Capsicum annum L.) grown in closed hydroponic systems in a glasshouse. The two salinity levels were attained by adding NaCl to the irrigation water used to prepare nutrient solution to obtain concentrations of 0. 8 and 6 mol m(- 3), and allowing the salts to progressively accumulate in the recycled nutrient solution. The two salinity levels were combined with two different levels of irrigation frequency in a two-factorial experimental design. Initially, the Na and Cl concentrations increased rapidly in the recycled effluents, but nearly three months after treatment initiation they converged gradually to maximal levels depending on the NaCl treatment. The low irrigation frequency imposed a more rapid salt accumulation in the <b>root</b> <b>zone,</b> which was ascribed to restriction {{of the volume of}} drainage solution. However, the maximal salt concentrations in the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> were independent of the watering schedule. This finding agrees with previous research revealing that the maximal salt accumulation in the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of <b>plants,</b> grown in closed hydroponics, is dictated merely by the NaCl concentration in the irrigation water. Total and Class I yields were suppressed by salt accumulation but the high irrigation frequency significantly mitigated the deleterious salinity effects. At low salinity, the low irrigation frequency raised significantly the weight percentage of fruits with blossom-end rot (BER), whereas at high salinity the incidence of BER was further increased without significant differences due to the irrigation regime.

40|$|Climate warming {{may result}} in range {{expansion}} of species towards previously colder environments, {{and it has been}} demonstrated that in the new range successfully range-expanding plant species can be less attacked by aboveground and belowground enemies than congeneric natives. Plant enemies may be controlled naturally by complex bottom-up and top-down interactions with their hosts, however, little is known about how these interactions may operate in the new range. Here, we examine how root-feeding nematodes are controlled in the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of successfully range-expanding plant species in comparison with congeneric plant species native to the new range. As range-expanding plant species can have less negative soil feedback than congeneric natives, we tested the hypothesis that top-down control of root-feeding nematodes may be strongest on range-expanding plant species. To test this, we grew four pairs of range-expanding plant species and their native congeners in field soil, to which we added soil microbes, nematodes, or microarthropods from the new habitat. Addition of soil microorganisms and microarthropods reduced the numbers of root-feeding nematodes, being strongest when microorganisms were added. Opposite to our expectation, nematode control was not more effective in the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of range-expanding than native plant species. We conclude that top-down control of root-feeding nematodes is highly plant species-specific and that top-down control of these nematodes in the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of range-expanding <b>plant</b> species can be as effective as in the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of congeneric natives...|$|R
40|$|Macaranga denticulata is a fallow {{enriching}} {{species that}} is important in upland agriculture in parts of northern Thailand. The <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of this tree supports a high biodiversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi {{and it has been}} postulated that these are important for Macaranga to rapidly establish in disturbed fields. To evaluate this, seedlings were inoculated with spores of AM fungi (Glomus spp., G. fasciculatum, Acaulospora spp. and mixed species of AM fungi) collected from the field, and then grown without P fertilizer. Growth of the host was compared with plants grown concurrently at six rates of phosphorus application (0 to 150 mg P/kg soil). The experiments were conducted in pots containing 5 kg sterilized soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation increased height and plant dry weight. Dry weights of M. denticulata inoculated with Acaulospora spp. or mixed species of AM fungi were equivalent to uninoculated plants given 150 mg P/kg soil, whereas plants inoculated with Glomus spp and G. fasciculatum were similar to those with 25 mg P/kg soil. Nutrient contents of plant inoculated with Acaulospora spp. and mixed species of AM fungi were higher than plants inoculated with Glomus spp and G. fasciculatum. Root colonization of plants inoculated with Acaulospora spp. and mixed species of AM fungi was not significantly different, and was higher than other inoculated treatments. These experiments have shown that M. denticulata is dependent on AM fungi for rapid growth in a low P soil. Acaulospora morrowiae appeared to be the dominant species sporulating in <b>root</b> <b>zones</b> of <b>plants</b> inoculated with either Acaulospora spp. or mixed species of AM fungi. Further work is required to identify the most effective AM species for M denticulata since the abundance of AM spores in the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> may not be directly related to the effectiveness of root colonization in nutrient uptake of the tree...|$|R
40|$|Localized irrigation, which wets {{a part of}} the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> only, {{is widely}} used in olive orchards. The effect of partial wetting of the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> on <b>plant</b> {{performance}} is unknown. The aim of this work was to compare fruit and oil yields in olive trees under localized irrigation (LI treatment) to those from trees with the whole <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> under non-limiting soil water conditions (Pond treatment). The LI trees received enough water to replace the crop water needs. The study was made for three consecutive years in mature 'Manzanilla de Sevilla' olive trees growing under field conditions. Main variables were also measured in young trees of the same cultivar growing in 50. L pots. Samples from rain-fed trees were also analysed. The LI trees showed similar water status than the Pond trees, but reduced stomatal conductance. As expected, the effect of the irrigation treatments on net photosynthesis was less evident. We observed a decrease in fruit yield in the LI trees, as compared to the Pond trees, likely because of the reduced gas exchange. No differences between the LI and Pond treatments were found for fruit weight, pulp:stone ratio, volume and the longitudinal and equatorial diameters. The LI treatment did not cause detrimental effect either on total oil content or virgin olive oil yield. The phenols content was greater in the LI treatment, but the (E) -hex- 2 -enal, one of the major volatile compounds and most related to the positive attributes of olive oil, was lower. No significant differences with the Pond treatment were found, however, in the sensory description of the oil flavours.

40|$|The abundance, identities, and {{degradation}} abilities of indigenous polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) -degrading bacteria associated with five species of mature trees growing naturally in a contaminated site were investigated to identify plants that enhance the microbial PCB degradation potential in soil. Culturable PCB degraders {{were associated with}} every plant species examined in both the rhizosphere and <b>root</b> <b>zone,</b> which {{was defined as the}} bulk soil in which the plant was rooted. Significantly higher numbers of PCB degraders (2. 7 - to 56. 7 -fold-higher means) were detected in the <b>root</b> <b>zones</b> of Austrian pine (Pinus nigra) and goat willow (Salix caprea) than in the <b>root</b> <b>zones</b> of other <b>plants</b> or non-root-containing soil in certain seasons and at certain soil depths. The majority of culturable PCB degraders throughout the site and the majority of culturable PCB degraders associated with plants were identified as members of the genus Rhodococcus by 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Other taxa of PCB-degrading bacteria included members of the genera Luteibacter and Williamsia, which have not previously been shown to include PCB degraders. PCB degradation assays revealed that some isolates from the site have broad congener specificities; these isolates included one Rhodococcus strain that exhibited degradation abilities similar to those of Burkholderia xenovorans LB 400. Isolates with broad congener specificity were widespread at the site, including in the biostimulated <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of willow. The apparent association of certain plant species with increased abundance of indigenous PCB degraders, including organisms with outstanding degradation abilities, throughout the <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> supports the notion that biostimulation through rhizoremediation is a promising strategy for enhancing PCB degradation in situ...|$|R
