40|$|In {{southern}} China, {{as well as}} {{in neighboring}} Asian regions, human adenovirus type 3 (HAdV- 3) outbreaks have become very prevalent in recent years. To address this problem regionally and globally, a recombinant virus has been constructed, containing a full-length infectious genomic clone of HAdV- 3, to act as a vaccine. This was constructed by using a bacterial homologous recombination mechanism and was based on the cloning, manipulation and maintenance of the full-length adenovirus genome as a stable plasmid in E. coli. The resultant recombinant viral DNA was screened, identified and characterized by duplex PCR, Western blot, indirect immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy. This putative vaccine strain was shown to be fully infectious in permissive cells, and no genome mutations were found in the recombinant plasmid. To demonstrate the utility of such a vaccine, a recombinant HAdV- 3 plasmid expressing the reporter molecule eGFP was also constructed. This confirmed the recombinant protein expression capability. Mice immunized with this recombinant eGFP adenovirus by either intramuscular injection, intragastric or intranasal inoculation routes raised a significant antibody response to eGFP.

In this study, we constructed an attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhi strain stably expressing conserved nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by integrating the N gene into the pilV gene, which was {{under the control of the}} type IVB pilus operon promoter in S. enterica serovar Typhi. BALB/c mice were immunized with this recombinant strain through different routes: intranasally, orogastrically, intraperitoneally, and intravenously.

Moreover, this <b>recombinant</b> <b>live</b> <b>vaccine</b> induced significantly high levels of specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activities and increased gamma interferon-producing T cells compared with the parental strain. Our work provides insights into how the type IVB pilus operon promoter controlling SARS-CoV N gene expression in Salmonella might be attractive for a live-vector vaccine against SRAS-CoV infection, for it could induce mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune responses.

TBFV infections cause thousands of human encephalitis cases worldwide annually. In the United States, human TBFV infections with Powassan virus (POWV) are increasing {{and have a}} fatality rate of 10 to 30 %. Additionally, Langat virus (LGTV) is a TBFV of low neurovirulence and {{is used as a}} model TBFV. TBFV replication and dissemination within I.  scapularis organs are poorly characterized, and a deeper understanding of virus biology in this vector may inform effective countermeasures to reduce TBFV transmission. Here, we describe short-term, I.  scapularis organ culture models of TBFV infection. Ex vivo organs were metabolically active for 9 to 10  days and were permissive to LGTV and POWV replication. Imaging and videography demonstrated replication and spread of green fluorescent protein-expressing LGTV in the organs. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed LGTV envelope and POWV protein synthesis within the infected organs. LGTV- and POWV-infected organs produced infectious LGTV and POWV; thus, the ex vivo cultures were suitable for study of virus replication in individual organs. LGTV- and POWV-infected midgut and salivary glands were subjected to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) transfection with dsRNA to the LGTV 3 ′ untranslated region (UTR), which reduced infectious LGTV and POWV replication, providing a proof-of-concept use of RNA interference in I.  scapularis organ cultures to study the effects on TBFV replication. The results contribute important information on TBFV localization within ex vivo I.  scapularis organs and provide a significant translational tool for evaluating <b>recombinant,</b> <b>live</b> <b>vaccine</b> candidates and potential tick transcripts and proteins for possible therapeutic use and vaccine development to reduce TBFV transmission...|$|E

The growth and virulence of HSV- 1 is markedly reduced by the deletion of UL 41. In this report, the UL 41 -deleted recombinant HSV- 1 strain VR∆ 41 was evaluated as a prophylactic live attenuated vaccine against lethal HSV- 1 infection in a mouse model. Intraperitoneal (i. p.) inoculation with the VR∆ 41 strain clearly inhibited lethal wild-type HSV- 1 (VR- 3 strain) infection after both i. p. and intracerebral (i. c.) inoculations. Vaccination with the VR∆ 41 strain was safer than VR- 3 vaccination {{and was able to}} protect against a wild-type challenge to the same degree as VR- 3 vaccination. In contrast, i. p. inoculation with ultraviolet-irradiated VR- 3 induced resistance against i. p. infection, but not against i. c. Although replication of the VR∆ 41 strain in mice was greatly reduced compared to that of the VR- 3 strain, VR∆ 41 strain maintained the ability to spread to the central nervous system (CNS) from a peripheral inoculation site. These results indicated that the VR∆ 41 strain evoked a potent immune reaction through viral protein expression within CNS without the induction of lethal encephalitis. The entry of antigens into the CNS was essential for the establishment of protective immunity against the lethal HSV encephalitis. We concluded that only a live attenuated vaccine is able to afford a prophylactic effect against CNS infection with HSV.

Transfer of the P 1 and P 3 genes to two viruses within the H 3 N 2 subtype of influenza A virus (i. e., the A/Victoria/ 3 / 75 and A/Alaska/ 6 / 77 viruses) conferred on each variant the following properties: (i) 37 °C shutoff temperature for plaque formation, (ii) almost complete restriction of viral replication in the lungs, (iii) a 100 -fold restriction of viral replication in the nasal turbinates, and (iv) genetic stability after replication in hamsters. This study was undertaken {{to determine whether the}} transfer of the two ts- 1 A 2 temperature-sensitive genes into a virus belonging to the H 1 N 1 subtype (i. e., the A/Hong Kong/ 123 / 77 virus) would result in a restriction of replication in vitro and in vivo comparable to that observed with the previously studied H 3 N 2 recombinant viruses in hamsters. This was found to be the case. In addition, infection of hamsters with the A/Hong Kong/ 77 -ts- 1 A 2 virus induced significant resistance to infection with wild-type A/Hong Kong/ 77 virus. Thus, the two ts- 1 A 2 temperature-sensitive genes attenuated influenza A viruses belonging to two distinct subtypes to a specific and predictable level.

Although, a good safety profile was historically attributed to the 17 D vaccine, serious adverse events have been reported, making the development of a safer, more modern vaccine desirable. Methodology/Principal Findings: A gene encoding the precursor of the membrane and envelope (prME) protein of the YFV- 17 D strain was inserted into the non-replicating modified vaccinia virus Ankara and into the D 4 R-defective vaccinia virus. Candidate vaccines based on the recombinant vaccinia viruses were assessed for immunogenicity and protection in a mouse model and compared to the commercial YFV- 17 D <b>vaccine.</b> The <b>recombinant</b> <b>live</b> <b>vaccines</b> induced c-interferon-secreting CD 4 - and functionally active CD 8 -T cells, and conferred full protection against lethal challenge already after a single low immunization dose of 105 TCID 50.

40|$|SUMMARY : Anthrax, an {{uncommon}} disease in humans, {{is caused by}} a large bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. The risk of inhalation infection is the main indication for anthrax vaccination. Pre-exposure vaccination is provided by an acellular vaccine (anthrax vaccine adsorbed or AVA), which contains anthrax toxin elements and results in protective immunity after 3 to 6 doses. Anthrax vaccine precipitated (AVP) is administered at primovaccination in 3 doses with a booster dose after 6 months. To evoke and maintain protective immunity, it is necessary to administer a booster dose once at 12 months. In Russia, <b>live</b> spore <b>vaccine</b> (STI) has been used in a two-dose schedule.

Because safety concerns may preclude the use of strain RB 51 -based <b>recombinant</b> <b>live</b> <b>vaccines,</b> we explored {{the ability of a}} gamma-irradiated recombinant RB 51 strain to induce heterologous antigen-specific immune responses in BALB/c mice. Exposure of strain RB 51 G/LacZ expressing Escherichia coli β-galactosidase to a minimum of 300 kilorads of gamma radiation resulted in complete loss of replicative ability. These bacteria, however, remained metabolically active and continued to synthesize β-galactosidase. A single intraperitoneal inoculation of mice with 109 CFU equivalents of gamma-irradiated, but not heat-killed, RB 51 G/LacZ induced a β-galactosidase-specific Th 1 -type immune response. Though no obvious differences were detected in immune responses to B. abortus-specific antigens, mice vaccinated with gamma-irradiated, but not heat-killed, RB 51 G/LacZ developed significant protection against challenge with virulent B. abortus. In vitro experiments indicated that gamma-irradiated and heat-killed RB 51 G/LacZ induced maturation of dendritic cells; however, stimulation with gamma-irradiated bacteria resulted in more interleukin- 12 secretion.

40|$|Salmonella enterica is a {{versatile}} vaccine carrier for heterologous antigens. One strategy for vaccine antigen delivery {{is the use}} of live attenuated S. enterica strains that translocate heterologous antigens into antigen-presenting cells by means of type III secretion systems (T 3 SS). The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated in various experimental vaccination studies. The efficacy of <b>recombinant</b> <b>live</b> <b>vaccines</b> is critically influenced by the optimal level of attenuation and many other factors. For the rational design of approaches involving translocation by T 3 SS, additional parameters are the level of expression of the heterologous antigens and the selection of carrier proteins for the delivery of antigens to desirable subcellular compartments of the target cell. We deployed the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI 2) -encoded T 3 SS for antigen delivery. The SPI 2 -T 3 SS and effector proteins are encoded by members of the large SsrAB regulon, including promoters with highly variable strength of expression. We investigated the effect of various in vivo-activated promoters of the SsrAB regulon on the efficacy of recombinant Salmonella vaccines. We observed that the use of promoters with higher strength results in greater synthesis of recombinant antigens and greater stimulation of T-cell re-sponses in cell culture assays for the stimulation of T cells by the model antigen ovalbumin.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{self-sufficient}} autotransporter (AT) pathway, {{ubiquitous in}} Gram-negative bacteria, combines {{a relatively simple}} protein secretion mechanism with a high transport capacity. ATs consist of a secreted passenger domain and a β-domain that facilitates transfer of the passenger across the cell-envelope. They have a great potential for the extracellular expression of recombinant proteins but their exploitation has suffered from the limited structural knowledge of carrier ATs. Capitalizing on its crystal structure, we have engineered the Escherichia coli AT Hemoglobin protease (Hbp) into a platform for the secretion and surface display of heterologous proteins, using the Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccine target ESAT 6 as a model protein. Results Based on the Hbp crystal structure, five passenger side domains were selected {{and one by one}} replaced by ESAT 6, whereas a β-helical core structure (β-stem) was left intact. The resulting Hbp-ESAT 6 chimeras were efficiently and stably secreted into the culture medium of E. coli. On the other hand, Hbp-ESAT 6 fusions containing a truncated β-stem appeared unstable after translocation, demonstrating the importance of an intact β-stem. By interrupting the cleavage site between passenger and β-domain, Hbp-ESAT 6 display variants were constructed that remain cell associated and facilitate efficient surface exposure of ESAT 6 as judged by proteinase K accessibility and whole cell immuno-EM analysis. Upon replacement of the passenger side domain of an alternative AT, EspC, ESAT 6 was also efficiently secreted, showing the approach is more generally applicable to ATs. Furthermore, Hbp-ESAT 6 was efficiently displayed in an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium strain upon chromosomal integration of a single encoding gene copy, demonstrating the potential of the Hbp platform for <b>live</b> <b>vaccine</b> development. Conclusions We developed the first structurally informed AT platform for efficient secretion and surface display of heterologous proteins. The platform has potential with regard to the development of <b>recombinant</b> <b>live</b> <b>vaccines</b> and may be useful for other biotechnological applications that require high-level secretion or display of recombinant proteins by bacteria. </p...|$|R

The immunization of macaques induced vigorous humoral responses to adenovirus capsid and non-structural proteins, although, surprisingly, not against HPV L 1. In contrast, immunization elicited strong T-cell responses to HPV VLPs as well as adenovirus virions.

The RV genome consists of 11 double-stranded RNA segments. In some cases, an RNA segment is replaced by a rearranged RNA segment, which is derived from its standard counterpart by partial sequence duplication. We report here a reverse genetics system for RV based on the preferential packaging of rearranged RNA segments. Using this system, wild-type or in vitro-engineered forms of rearranged segment 7 from a human rotavirus (encoding the NSP 3 protein), derived from cloned cDNAs and transcribed in the cytoplasm of COS- 7 cells with the help of T 7 RNA polymerase, replaced the wild-type segment 7 of a bovine helper virus (strain RF).

40|$|To {{test the}} use of <b>recombinant</b> streptococci as <b>live</b> <b>vaccine</b> vectors, colonization/immunization {{experiments}} were performed with Streptococcus gordonii expressing heterologous cell-surface antigens. Three isogenic strains of S. gordonii were used: a wild-type, a recombinant expressing the M 6 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes, and a recombinant expressing the E 7 protein of human papillomavirus type 16 as a fusion with the M 6 protein. A single dose of live bacteria was used to inoculate outbred mice, and it was found that: (i) mice were stably colonized by a single intranasal/oral inoculum of S. gordonii; (ii) recombinant strains were equally effective as wild-type in colonizing mice; (iii) {{two months after the}} inoculum, oral/pharyngeal swabs of 83. 3 % of animals were still positive for isolation of S. gordonii; (iv) recombinant S. gordonii isolated from colonized mice were always positive for expression of the heterologous antigens; (v) live bacteria induced a systemic immune response, since sera of mice colonized with recombinant S. gordonii contained IgG specific for the heterologous cell-surface antigens; (vi) this immune response depended upon the effective colonization by live bacteria, since killed bacteria did not induce such a response...|$|R
40|$|Vaccination is {{the most}} {{effective}} method of preventing infectious diseases. Since the eradication of small pox in 1976, many other potentially life compromising if not threatening diseases have been dealt with subsequently. This event was a major leap not only in the scientific world already burdened with many diseases but also in the mindset of the common man who became more receptive to novel treatment options. Among the many protozoan diseases, the leishmaniases have {{emerged as one of the}} largest parasite killers of the world, second only to malaria. There are three types of leishmaniases namely cutaneous (CL), mucocutaneous (ML) and visceral (VL), caused by a group of more than 20 species of Leishmania parasites. Visceral leishmaniasis, also known as kala-azar {{is the most}} severe form and almost fatal if untreated. Since the first attempts at leishmanization, we have killed parasite vaccines, subunit protein or DNA vaccines, and now we have <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> carrier <b>vaccines</b> and <b>live</b> attenuated parasite <b>vaccines</b> under various stages of development. Although some research has shown promising results, many more potential genes need to be evaluated as <b>live</b> attenuated <b>vaccine</b> candidates. This mini-review attempts to summarize the success and failures of genetically modified organisms used in vaccination against some of major parasitic diseases for their application in leishmaniasis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction of a {{sequence}} encoding 147 amino acids from {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type I (HIV- 1) strain MN glycoprotein gp 120 into the RNA genome of the stably attenuated Mengo virus strain vM 16 yielded an infectious recombinant virus, vMLN 450, which expressed the heterologous HIV- 1 sequence along with the normal Mengo virus proteins. The HIV- 1 gp 120 sequence, fused to the amino terminus of the short, nonstructural Mengo virus leader polypeptide was recognized by a gp 120 V 3 loop-specific monoclonal antibody. When inoculated into mice, recombinant virus vMLN 450 elicited a high-titer anti-HIV- 1 antibody response {{as well as an}} HIV- 1 MN-specific cytotoxic cellular immune response. An anti-HIV- 1 antibody response could also be detected in cynomolgus monkeys after a single immunization. We propose that attenuated Mengo virus can serve as an effective expression vector in cell systems and various animal species and offers another approach to the development of new, <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a method for attenuating vaccinia virus recombinants by expressing a fusion protein of a lymphokine and an immunogen. Chimeric genes were constructed that coded for gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and structural proteins of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). In this study, we describe the biological and immunological properties of vaccinia virus recombinants expressing chimeric genes of murine or human IFN-gamma with glycoprotein gp 120, gag, and a fragment of gp 41. All fusion proteins retained the antigenic characteristics of both IFN-gamma and HIV as shown by immunoblot analysis. However, the antiviral activity of IFN-gamma could be demonstrated only for the IFN-gamma-gag fusion protein. In contrast, the attenuating activity of IFN-gamma for nude mice was retained {{by all of the}} recombinants, albeit at various rates. Unlike the antiviral activity, the attenuating activity of IFN-gamma was not species specific. Implications for the development of attenuated <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccines</b> for AIDS are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a {{versatile}} organism for {{the generation of}} <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccines</b> for mucosal immunization. Various strategies have been devised for the stable and efficient expression of heterologous antigens by attenuated S. enterica strains, but these methods often require complex manipulations. Use of phage λ Red recombinase has recently been devised for gene replacements in Escherichia coli and S. enterica after introduction of PCR products. Based on this method, we have developed an approach that allows the integration of recombinant expression cassettes for heterologous antigens in a single step. The recombinant construct is integrated into the chromosome and is devoid of any selective marker such as antibiotic resistance. We observed the stable expression of model antigens without selective pressure. In addition, the method allows the simultaneous generation of attenuating mutations by gene deletions. The novel “knock-in” approach allows the rapid and efficient construction of recombinant Salmonella strains as vaccine carriers...|$|R
40|$|Rabies is a {{zoonotic}} viral encephalitis {{caused by}} rabies virus (RABV), and remains a global health {{threat of the}} 21 st century, responsible for over 55, 000 deaths annually. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) consisting of several immunizations with inactivated RABV is a safe and effective treatment for RABV exposure, yet remains expensive and cumbersome for use {{in areas of the}} developing world most afflicted by endemic rabies. A primary goal of our lab is the development of a safe and highly effective single-dose RABV-based vaccine, and to this end we have investigated the interactions of RABV-based vaccines with host immune cells. A <b>recombinant</b> <b>live</b> RABV-based <b>vaccine</b> rRABV, and its derivative replication-deficient counterpart rRABV-DM missing the matrix (M) gene of the rabies genome, were found to infect primary mouse and human B cells in vitro and initiate their activation towards a potent antigen presenting costimulatory phenotype capable of priming and activating naïve CD 4 T cells in vitro in an antigen-specific manner. rRABV-ICAM 1, expressing the gene for mouse intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), exhibited elevated in vitro infection and activation of mouse B cells in vitro, and demonstrated increased potency over rRABV immunization in the induction of a protective anti-RABV antibody response. Finally, rRABV-based vaccines were demonstrated to infect primary mouse macrophages in vitro, and via clodronate-loaded liposome (CLL) -mediated macrophage depletion, lymph node macrophage subsets were implicated as essential contributors to the antibody response to rRABV-DM immunization in mice. Together, these studies contribute to our understanding of RABV-based vaccine functionality, and open doors to further mechanistic investigation of the response to RABV-based vaccines, as well as the development of more effective vaccines for rabies PEP. ...|$|R

Unfortunately, there is no vaccine which has been designed specifically for use in breeding stocks of falcons. Therefore the immunogenicity and protective capacity of two commercially available WNV vaccines, both approved for use in horses, were evaluated in large falcons. One vaccine contained adjuvanted inactivated WNV lineage 1 immunogens, while the second represented a canarypox <b>recombinant</b> <b>live</b> virus vector <b>vaccine.</b> The efficacy of different vaccination regimes for these two vaccines was assessed serologically and by challenging the falcons with a WNV strain of homologous lineage 1. Our {{studies show that the}} recombinant vaccine conveys a slightly better protection than the inactivated vaccine, but moderate (recombinant vaccine) or weak (inactivated vaccine) side effects were observed at the injection sites. Using the recommended 2 -dose regimen, both vaccines elicited only sub-optimal antibody responses and gave only partial protection following WNV challenge. Better results were obtained for both vaccines after a third dose, i. e. alleviation of clinical signs, absence of fatalities and reduction of virus shedding and viraemia. Therefore the consequences of WNV infections in falcons can be clearly alleviated by vaccination, especially if the amended triple administration scheme is used, although side effects at the vaccination site must be accepted...|$|R
40|$|CD 8 + T-cell {{responses}} can {{be induced}} by DNA immunization, but {{little is known}} about the kinetics of these responses in vivo in the absence of restimulation or how soon protective immunity is conferred by a DNA vaccine. It is also unclear if CD 8 + T cells primed by DNA vaccines express the vigorous effector functions characteristic of cells primed by natural infection or by immunization with a <b>recombinant</b> <b>live</b> virus <b>vaccine.</b> To address these issues, we have used the sensitive technique of intracellular cytokine staining to carry out direct ex vivo kinetic and phenotypic analyses of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells present in the spleens of mice at various times after (i) a single intramuscular administration of a plasmid expressing the nucleoprotein (NP) gene from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), (ii) infection by a recombinant vaccinia virus carrying the same protein (vvNP), or (iii) LCMV infection. In addition, we have evaluated the rapidity with which protective immunity against both lethal and sublethal LCMV infections is achieved following DNA vaccination. The CD 8 + T-cell response in DNA-vaccinated mice was slightly delayed compared to LCMV or vvNP vaccinees, peaking at 15 days postimmunization. Interestingly, the percentage of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells present in the spleen at day 15 and later time points was similar to that observed following vvNP infection. T cells primed by DNA vaccination or by infection exhibited similar cytokine expression profiles and had similar avidities for an immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope peptide, implying that the responses induced by DNA vaccination differ quantitatively but not qualitatively from those induced by live virus infection. Surprisingly, protection from both lethal and sublethal LCMV infections was conferred within 1 week of DNA vaccination, well before the peak of the CD 8 + T-cell response...|$|R
40|$|The {{display of}} peptide {{segments}} {{on the surface}} of bacteria offers many new and exciting applications in biotechnology and medical research. Fimbria-assisted display of heterologous sequences is a paradigm for chimeric organelle display on bacteria. Fimbriae are particularly attractive candidates for epitope display for several reasons: (1) they are present in extremely high numbers at the cell surface, (2) they are strong immunogens, (3) they possess inherent adhesive properties, and (4) they can be easily purified. The majority of work dealing with fimbria-assisted peptide display has been focused on the development of recombinant vaccines. A number of different fimbrial types have been used to display immune-relevant sectors of various foreign proteins. Chimeric fimbrial vaccines can be used in the context of purified proteins, however the potential also exists to exploit this technology for the development of <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Work has also been performed demonstrating the amenability of fimbriae towards the powerful technology of random peptide display.
