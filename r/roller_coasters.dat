5|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>coasters</b> are {{amusement}} rides {{developed for}} amusement parks and modern theme parks. During the 16th and 17th centuries, rides consisting of wooden sleds that took riders down large slides made from ice were popular in Russia. The first <b>roller</b> <b>coasters,</b> where {{the train was}} attached to a wooden track, first appeared in France in the early 1800s. Although wooden <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> are still being produced, steel <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> are more common {{and can be found}} on every continent except Antarctica.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, GateKeeper ranked {{third in}} Amusement Todays Golden Ticket Award for Best New Ride behind Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City and Iron Rattler at Six Flags Fiesta Texas. It also debuted 28th {{on the list}} for Top Steel <b>Roller</b> <b>Coasters,</b> making {{it the first time}} ever that Cedar Point had six steel <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> in the top 50.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> is the {{box-section}} track. The running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard <b>roller</b> <b>coasters,</b> such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, Blue Streak, {{a wooden}} <b>roller</b> <b>coaster,</b> was built and {{named for the}} local high school's mascot.

It was the seventeenth <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> {{built at the}} park since Blue Streak in 1964. It is notable as being the 500th <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> {{designed}} by German engineer Werner Stengel and the first <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> featuring a Twisted Horseshoe Roll. Maverick's US$21-million price tag makes it Cedar Point's fourth most expensive <b>roller</b> <b>coaster,</b> behind Millennium Force, Top Thrill Dragster, and GateKeeper.

5|$|Village Roadshow Theme Parks, {{the owners}} of Warner Bros. Movie World {{attributed}} a rise in attendance {{to the opening of}} the Green Lantern Coaster. The company labelled the launch of the ride as a success. The attraction's downtime has been reported several times by local media, however, this behaviour is not unusual for amusement rides. Green Lantern Coaster, along with other El Loco <b>roller</b> <b>coasters,</b> ranked 182 out of the 365 steel <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> in the worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll for 2012.|$|E

In 2013, GateKeeper was the most frequently-ridden roller coaster at Cedar Point, and it ranked 28th among steel <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> in the annual Golden Ticket Awards poll from Amusement Today.|$|E

5|$|Magnetic brakes {{were first}} used on Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2001. Magnetic brakes slow down trains {{much faster than}} {{friction}} brakes; most B <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> built in or after 2001 {{have at least one}} set of magnetic brakes. Magnetic brakes do not make contact with the train. Fins that run parallel to the train are fitted beneath the seats. As the fins pass through the brakes, the magnetic field created by the brakes slows the train. Magnetic brakes have also been used as an alternate type of trim brake on B <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> such as Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland.|$|E
