40|$|There are {{currently}} no validated animal models that can identify {{low molecular weight}} (LMW) <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers.</b> The Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) is a validated animal model developed to detect contact sensitizers using skin exposure, but all LMW <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> tested so far were also positive in this assay. Discrimination between contact and <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> {{can be achieved by}} the assessment of cytokine profiles. In a LLNA using the inhalation route, both contact and <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> enhanced proliferation in the draining lymph nodes. The question was if their cytokine profiles were affected by the route of exposure. Male BALB/c mice were exposed head/nose-only during 3 consecutive days to the <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> trimellitic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, toluene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), and isophorone diisocyanate; the contact sensitizers dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), oxazolone (OXA) and formaldehyde (FA), and the irritant methyl salicylate (MS). Three days after the last exposure the draining lymph nodes were excised and cytokine production was measured after ex vivo stimulation with Concanavalin A. Skin application was used as a positive control. After inhalation exposure the <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> induced more interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) and interleukin (IL- 10) compared to the contact sensitizers, whereas the contact sensitizers, except formaldehyde, induced relatively more interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production. When IL- 4 and IFN-γ were plotted {{as a function of the}} proliferative response, it was shown that IL- 4 could be used to identify <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers,</b> except HDI, at concentration levels inducing intermediate stimulation indices. HDI could be distinguished from DNCB and OXA at high SI values. In contrast, contact sensitizers could only be identified when IFN-γ was measured at high stimulation indices. The skin positive control, tested at high concentrations, showed comparable results for IL- 4 and IL- 10, whereas IFN-γ levels could not be used to discriminate between <b>respiratory</b> and contact <b>sensitizers.</b> The contact sensitizer FA and the irritant MS did not induce significant cytokine production after inhalation and skin exposure.

40|$|Repeated {{exposure}} to certain {{low molecular weight}} (LMW) chemical compounds may result in development of allergic reactions in the skin or in the respiratory tract. In most cases, a certain LMW compound selectively sensitize the skin, giving rise to allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), or the respiratory tract, giving rise to occupational asthma (OA). To limit occurrence of allergic diseases, efforts are currently being made to develop predictive assays that accurately identify chemicals capable of inducing such reactions. However, while a few promising methods for prediction of skin sensitization have been described, to date no validated method, in vitro or in vivo, exists that is able to accurately classify chemicals as <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers.</b> Recently, we presented the in vitro based Genomic Allergen Rapid Detection (GARD) assay as a novel testing strategy for classification of skin sensitizing chemicals based on measurement of a genomic biomarker signature.

This article presents the evaluation of structure–activity relationship (SAR) models as potential methods to prospectively conclude on the sensitization potential of LMW chemicals. The predictive performance of the SARs calculated from their training sets was compared to their performance on a dataset of newly identified <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> and nonsensitizers, derived from literature. The predictivity of the available SARs for new substances was markedly lower than their published predictive performance. For that reason, no single SAR model can be considered sufficiently reliable to conclude on potential LMW respiratory sensitization properties of a substance. The individual applicability domains (ADs) of the models were analyzed for adequacies and deficiencies. Based on these findings, a tiered prediction approach is subsequently proposed. This approach combines the two SARs with the highest positive and negative predictivity taking into account model specific chemical AD issues.

Although several in vitro assays to predict the sensitizing potential of chemicals have been developed, these methods cannot distinguish chemical <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> and skin sensitizers. In the present study, we describe a novel in vitro assay that can discriminate <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> from chemical skin sensitizers {{by taking advantage of}} the fundamental difference between their modes of action, namely the development of the T helper 2 immune response, which is critically important for respiratory sensitization. First, we established a novel three-dimensional (3 D) coculture system of human upper airway epithelium using a commercially available scaffold. It consists of human airway epithelial cell line BEAS- 2 B, immature dendritic cells (DCs) derived from human peripheral blood CD 14 + monocytes, and human lung fibroblast cell line MRC- 5. Respective cells were first cultured in individual scaffolds and subsequently assembled into a 3 D multi-cell tissue model to more closely mimic the in vivo situation. Then, three typical chemicals that are known <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> (ortho-phthaldialdehyde, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and trimellitic anhydride) and skin sensitizers (oxazolone, formaldehyde, and dinitrochlorobenzene) were added individually to the 3 D coculture system. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that DCs do not migrate into other scaffolds under the experimental conditions. Therefore, the 3 D structure was disassembled and real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was performed in individual scaffolds to analyze the expression levels of molecules critical for Th 2 differentiation such as OX 40 ligand (OX 40 L), interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 10, IL- 33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. Both sensitizers showed similarly augmented expression of DC maturation markers (e. g., CD 86), but among these molecules, OX 40 L expression in DCs was most consistently and significantly enhanced by <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> as compared to that by skin sensitizers.

40|$|Sensitization of the {{respiratory}} tract {{is an important}} occupational health challenge, and understanding the mechanistic basis of this effect is necessary to support the development of toxicological tools to detect chemicals that may cause it. Here we use the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework to organize information that may better inform our understanding of sensitization of {{the respiratory}} tract, building on a previously published skin sensitization AOP, relying on literature evidence linked to low-molecular-weight organic chemicals and excluding other known <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> acting via different molecular initiating events. The established key events (KEs) are as follows: (1) covalent binding of chemicals to proteins, (2) activation of cellular danger signals (inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and cytoprotective gene pathways), (3) dendritic cell activation and migration, (4) activation, proliferation, and polarization of T cells, and (5) sensitization of the respiratory tract. These events mirror the skin sensitization AOP but with specific differences. For example, {{there is some evidence}} that <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> bind preferentially to lysine moieties, whereas skin sensitizers bind to both cysteine and lysine. Furthermore, exposure to <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> seems to result in cell behavior for KEs 2 and 3, as well as the effector T cell response, in general skewing toward cytokine secretions predominantly associated with T helper 2 (Th 2) response.

40|$|Concerted {{international}} efforts are underway to build networks of AOPs with shared key events (KEs) {{to enable the}} database of known AOPs to eventually serve {{as a framework for}} contextualizing results of predictive test methods across varied biological mechanisms. The development of an AOP for sensitization of the respiratory tract by low-molecular-weight (LMW) organic chemicals was envisioned to build upon a skin sensitization AOP published by OECD in 2012, since KEs may be common to both pathways. Indeed, the established KEs, which are 1) Covalent binding of LMW chemicals to proteins, 2) Cellular Danger Signals: Activation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and cytoprotective gene pathways, 3) Dendritic cell activation and migration, 4) Activation and proliferation of T cells, and 5) B Cell activation and class switching, are very similar. However, there are differences. For example, though the Molecular Initiating Event (MIE), covalent binding to proteins, is common to the two AOPs, {{there is some evidence that}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> bind preferentially to lysine, whereas skin sensitizers bind to both cysteine and lysine. In some cases this preference may be consequential enough to the respiratory sensitization pathway that it warrants separate description from the MIE for skin sensitization.

We now report that differential cytokine secretion patterns are induced rapidly in the skin following first exposure to the contact allergen 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and the <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizer</b> trimellitic anhydride (TMA). TMA induced early expression of IL- 10, a cytokine implicated in the negative regulation of Langerhans cell (LC) migration, whereas exposure to DNCB resulted in production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL- 1 �. Associated with this, TMA provoked LC migration with delayed kinetics compared with DNCB, and local neutralization of IL- 10 caused enhanced LC mobilization in response to TMA with concomitant up-regulation of cutaneous IL- 1 �. We hypothesize that these differential epidermal cytokine profiles contribute to the polarization of immune responses to chemical allergens via effects on the phenotype of activated dendritic cells arriving in the draining lymph node.

Herein {{we report on the}} development and validation of an ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the measurement of five aromatic diamines, 4, 4 '-methylenedianiline (MDA), 2, 4 -toluenediamine (4 TDA), 2, 6 -toluenediamine (6 TDA), 1, 5 -naphthalenediamine (NDA), and p-phenylenediamine (PPDA) in human urine. The method incorporates sample preparation steps, which include a 4 h acid hydrolysis followed by high-throughput solid-phase extraction prior to chromatographic separation. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a C 18 reversed phase column with gradient elution of basic mobile phases (pH 9. 2). The duty cycle of the method was less than 5 min, including both the column equilibration and autosampler movement. Analytical detection was performed using positive ion atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (APCI-MS/MS) in scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) mode. Excellent linearity was observed over standard calibration curve concentration ranges of 3 orders of magnitude with method detection limit ranging from 10 to 100 pg/mL.

40|$|Occupational asthma is the {{principal}} cause of work-related respiratory disease in the industrial world. Toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate (TDI) {{is one of the}} most common <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> leading to occupational asthma. Using a mouse model of chemical-induced asthma we explored proteome changes in multiple compartments of mice sensitized and challenged with TDI or acetone-olive oil (AOO; vehicle). Airway reactivity to methacholine and a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell count was assessed in treated and control mice, 1 day after challenge. Subsequently, two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) was performed on auricular lymph nodes, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum comparing TDI-treated and control mice. The differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and pathway analysis was performed. TDI-treated mice exhibit increased airway reactivity (2. 6 fold increase) and a neutrophilic inflammation in the BAL fluid, compared to control mice. 2 D-DIGE showed 53, 210 and 40 differentially expressed proteins in the auricular lymph nodes, BAL and serum of TDI-treated versus vehicle-treated mice, respectively. Several of the identified proteins could be linked with inflammation, neutrophil chemotaxis and/or oxidative stress. Physiologic and immunologic readouts of the asthmatic phenotype, such as inflammation, were confirmed in three compartments by several of the differentially expressed proteins via 2 D-DIGE and computerized pathway analysis. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Offspring of {{asthmatic}} {{mothers have}} {{increased risk of}} developing asthma, based on human epidemiologic data and experimental animal models. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether maternal allergy at non-pulmonary sites can increase asthma risk in offspring. Methods BALB/c female mice received 2 topical applications of vehicle, dinitrochlorobenzene, or toluene diisocyanate before mating with untreated males. Dinitrochlorobenzene is a skin-sensitizer only and known to induce a Th 1 response, while toluene diisocyanate is both a skin and <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizer</b> that causes a Th 2 response. Both cause allergic contact dermatitis. Offspring underwent an intentionally suboptimal protocol of allergen sensitization and aerosol challenge, followed by evaluation of airway hyperresponsiveness, allergic airway inflammation, and cytokine production. Mothers were tested for allergic airway disease, evidence of dermatitis, cellularity of the draining lymph nodes, and systemic cytokine levels. The role of interleukin- 4 was also explored using interleukin- 4 deficient mice. Results Offspring of toluene diisocyanate but not dinitrochlorobenzene-treated mothers developed an asthmatic phenotype following allergen sensitization and challenge, seen as increased Penh values, airway inflammation, bronchoalveolar lavage total cell counts and eosinophilia, and Th 2 cytokine imbalance in the lung. Toluene diisocyanate treated interleukin- 4 deficient mothers were able to transfer asthma risk to offspring. Mothers in both experimental groups developed allergic contact dermatitis, but not allergic airway disease. Conclusion Maternal non-respiratory allergy (Th 2 -skewed dermatitis caused by toluene diisocyanate) can result in the maternal transmission of asthma risk in mice. </p...|$|E
40|$|Occupational asthma is the {{principal}} cause of work-related respiratory disease in the industrial world. We have attempted to produce immunologically mediated respiratory responses in mice sensitized to toluene diisocyanate (TDI), a known <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizer,</b> oxazolone, a known dermal sensitizer and a piperidinyl chlorotriazine derivative (PCT), which caused an outbreak of occupational asthma. BALB/C mice received the test chemical (20 µl of a 3 % solution) or vehicle (acetone/olive oil) on each ear for three consecutive days. On day 10, they were intranasally challenged with the same chemical (0. 1 or 1 %, 10 µl per nostril) or vehicle. Twenty four hours later, bronchial reactivity was assessed using methacholine (0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mg/ml) and measuring bronconstriction by whole body plethysmography (Buxco). Pulmonary inflammation was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage and histology. Mice sensitized and challenged with TDI (sensitization 3 %, challenge 0. 1 %, n= 4) showed higher bronchial reactivity (bronchoconstriction at 10 mg methacholine /ml) than the relevant control groups (bronchoconstriction at 50 mg methacholine /ml). However, {{there was no evidence}} for pulmonary inflammation. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with PCT (sensitization 3 %, challenge 1 %, n= 4). Mice sensitized and challenged with oxazolone (sensitization 3 %, challenge 0. 1 %, n= 4) did not show any higher bronchial reactivity than the control groups, and there was also no indication of pulmonary inflammation. In conclusion, we have been partially successful in our attempt to develop a model of chemical-induced asthma. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Up to 15 % of all asthma {{cases in}} adults {{are due to}} {{chemical}} exposures at the workplace. The identification of biomarkers of sensitization could help to move diagnosis to an earlier stage. Using a mouse model of chemical-induced asthma we will explore the process of sensitization towards chemicals at the protein and peptide level. Methods: On days 1 and 8, mice are treated on both ears with toluene diisocyanate (TDI, 0. 3 % or 3 %, 20 µl), a known <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizer,</b> or a mixture of acetone – olive oil (AOO, vehicle-control). On day 15, lymph nodes are collected and homogenized. We used two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) to analyze the differential expression of proteins in TDI and vehicle-treated lymph nodes. Results: Body weight of control mice and TDI-treated mice did not differ. Interestingly, the weight of auricular lymph nodes significantly increased with an increasing concentration of TDI. 2 D-DIGE analysis of these lymph nodes showed 35, 36 and 12 differential proteins comparing 0. 3 % and AOO, 3 % TDI and AOO and 0. 3 % TDI and 3 % TDI respectively. 17 proteins are already identified, among which several structural proteins and lymphocyte specific protein- 1. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the use of 2 D-DIGE {{in the search for}} (early) biomarkers of chemical-induced asthma. Further studies will have to point out whether (some of) these proteins could act as valuable biomarkers. Therefore, more samples (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, serum,…) will be analysed. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This {{article will}} focus on the role of risk factors {{including}} genetic factors in the development of sensitization and occupational asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: We will review the recent literature published on the genetics of occupational asthma, especially on genes coding for class II human leukocyte antigen and on respiratory antioxidant mechanisms. We will also discuss published work on non-occupational asthma and on allergic rhinitis because this information may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms involved in occupational asthma and serve to confirm data obtained on the disease. To date, although some progress has been made in the field of occupational asthma genetics, most studies were based on small sample sizes, findings were not replicated, and gene-environment interactions have not yet been established. SUMMARY: Occupational asthma is a widespread and frequent condition and has relevant long-term adverse health and economic consequences. The search for risk factors including genetic factors in the development of the disease and an understanding of the mechanisms of interaction between genes and environment are important because the identification of individuals who are susceptible to occupational asthma together with an effective control of exposure to <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers</b> in the workplace may be helpful in preventing the disease...|$|R
40|$|Lipocalin allergens, {{which contain}} {{most of the}} {{important}} animal-derived <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers,</b> induce T helper type 2 (Th 2) deviation, but {{the reasons for this}} are not clear. To explore the prospects for peptide-based allergen immunotherapy and to elucidate the characteristics of the immunodominant epitope of Bos d 2, BALB/c mice were immunized with a peptide containing the epitope, peptides containing its analogues, peptides from the corresponding regions of other lipocalin proteins, and peptides with a homologous sequence. We observed that murine spleen cells recognized the immunodominant epitope of Bos d 2, p 127 – 142, in almost the same way as human Bos d 2 -specific T cells did. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot-forming cell assay (ELISPOT) analyses showed that p 127 – 142 and a corresponding peptide from horse Equ c 1 induced a Th 2 -deviated cellular response, whereas a homologous bacterial peptide from Spiroplasma citri induced a Th 0 -type response. Interestingly, the spleen cell response to the bacterial peptide and p 127 – 142 was cross-reactive, that is, able to induce reciprocally the proliferation and cytokine production of primed spleen cells in vitro. More importantly, the peptides were able to skew the phenotype of T cells primed with the other peptide. Our results suggest that modified peptides can be useful in allergen immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Assessment {{of human}} {{exposure}} to toluene diisocyanate. Toluene diisocyanate (TDI), an aromatic compound, may be dangerous for human health. Diisocyanates have wide industrial {{use in the}} fabrication of flexible and rigid foams, fibers, elastomers, and coatings such as paints and varnishes. Isocyanates are known skin and <b>respiratory</b> <b>sensitizers,</b> and proper engineering controls should be in place to prevent exposure to isocyanate liquid and vapor; exposure to TDI vapors is well documented to increase asthma risk. The study focused on the exposure of workers and nearby populations to toluene diisocyanate in a Polyurethane Foam Factory located in Baia Mare, Romania. Workplace air measurements were performed in different departments of the plant, after sampling either in fixed points or as personal monitoring. Sampling in four different locations of Baia Mare town was carried out, - {{during and after the}} foaming process. TDI sampling was performed on silica cartridge followed by GC-MS analysis. TDI concentration at workplace was lower than 0, 035 mg/m³, which represents the permissible exposure limit, while in the city the TDI concentration had shown values below 0, 20 μg/m³. Health assessment of a group of 49 workers was based on questionnaire interview, determination of TDI antibodies and lung function tests. Data collected until this stage do not show any negative effects of TDI on the employees health. Since this plant had only recently begun operating, continuous workplace and ambient air TDI monitoring, along with workers health surveillance, is deemed necessary...|$|R
