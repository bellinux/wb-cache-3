5000|$|The {{failure of}} the Apollo 13 mission in April 1970 meant that the Lunar Module reentered the {{atmosphere}} carrying an RTG and burned up over Fiji. It carried a SNAP-27 RTG containing [...] of plutonium dioxide in a graphite cask on the lander leg which survived reentry into the Earth's atmosphere intact, as {{it was designed to}} do, the trajectory being arranged so that it would plunge into 6-9 kilometers of water in the Tonga trench in the Pacific Ocean. The absence of plutonium-238 contamination in atmospheric and seawater sampling confirmed the assumption that the cask is intact on the seabed. The cask is expected to contain the fuel for at least 10 half-lives (i.e. 870 years). The US Department of Energy has conducted seawater tests and determined that the graphite casing, which was designed to withstand reentry, is stable and no release of plutonium should occur. Subsequent investigations have found no increase in the natural background radiation in the area. The Apollo 13 accident represents an extreme scenario because of the high <b>re-entry</b> <b>velocities</b> of the craft returning from cis-lunar space (the region between Earth's atmosphere and the Moon).

40|$|On 5 December 2014, {{the first}} test flight of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle {{executed}} a unique and challenging flight profile including an elevated <b>re-entry</b> <b>velocity</b> and steeper flight path angle to envelope lunar re-entry conditions.

40|$|The {{first test}} {{flight of the}} Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle {{presented}} additional challenges for guidance, navigation and control as compared to a typical re-entry from the International Space Station or other Low Earth Orbit. An elevated <b>re-entry</b> <b>velocity</b> and steeper flight path angle were chosen to achieve aero-thermal flight test objectives. New IMU's, a GPS receiver, and baro altimeters were flight qualified to provide the redundant navigation needed for human space flight. The guidance and control systems must manage the vehicle lift vector in order to deliver the vehicle to a precision, coastal, water landing, while operating within aerodynamic load, reaction control system, and propellant constraints. Extensive pre-flight six degree-of-freedom analysis was performed that showed mission success for the nominal mission {{as well as in}} the presence of sensor and effector failures.

The rock samples {{are attached to the}} exterior of a FOTON re-entry capsule around the point of maximum heating, and exposed to <b>re-entry</b> <b>velocity</b> of 7. 6 km/s. The STONE 6 experiment, conducted in September 2007 [1], included an organic-rich sedimentary rock, in which the major objective was a detailed analysis of the fate of the organic matter. Experimental sample The sample was a Devonian laminite (siltstone) deposited in a lacustrine environment in the Orkney Islands, Scotland, UK. It contained about 1. 4 wt. % organic carbon, and was also carbonate-rich. The organic carbon and carbonate reflect algal colonization and photosynthesis in the lake waters.

40|$|Communication {{blackout}} generally {{occurs during}} the <b>re-entry</b> at high <b>velocities</b> through the atmosphere. Air {{ahead of the}} re-entry vehicle dissociates and then ionises, leading {{to the production of}} electrons. These electrons may reflect or attenuate the communication signals. Electron densities with plasma frequency exceeding the communication frequency lead to blackout. Electron density {{is a function of the}} body shape, velocity and altitude. The viscous shock layer method is used to predict the electron density, and thereby the plasma frequency for various configurations. This method is successfully implemented for analytic and non-analytic geometry configurations available in the literature. The electron densities computed for the RAM-C configuration agree well with the flight results. The onset of blackout during the re-entry phase is also predicted reasonably well by this method. The method performs well at high altitudes, where nonequilibrium conditions prevail. Defence Science Journal, 2011,  61 (4), pp. 364 - 369, DOI:[URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|Unmanned air {{vehicles}} {{are being developed}} today at an ever increasing rate. Some are being developed by traditional aircraft development organizations working hard to meet customer needs and desires and producing a large variety of such aircraft. But many of today’s UAVs are being developed by non-traditional aircraft companies, start-ups as well as companies {{that do not have}} a long tradition of meeting armed forces level specifications. In many cases the aircraft being fielded today have not had anything like a conventional structural qualification test program, and they are certified to fly by exception to the current rules in restricted and combat airspaces. These aircraft were developed to prove capabilities of such systems, but in doing so provided capabilities that are now considered indispensable in the battlefield, situational awareness unlike anything available in the past, with the ability to pin-point targets as small as individuals in theatre. These systems, however, have not been developed with consideration for durability, damage tolerance, maintainability or repairability. They were short life demonstrators plucked from the test ranges to the combat theatre to meet a need – a need that was considered too great to wait for anything like a traditional qualification test program. UAVs cover a broader range of the flight spectrum than manned vehicles. Applying traditional manned qualification processes to these vehicles can penalize the capabilities of autonomously controlled vehicles that respond more than fifty times as fast as humans to perturbances in the flight regime. To apply conventional qualification approaches to the very small aircraft coming onto the scene now is simply not justified either for cost or in recognition of the limited flight regime in which such aircraft fly. To develop a set of qualification guidelines that can extend across the panorama of flight from vehicles weighing grams to those crossing the sky at <b>re-entry</b> <b>velocities,</b> from vertical takeoff and landing vehicles to vehicles that remain airborne {{for weeks at a time}} has proven a challenge. It caused the Team to seek key parameters of flight and interpret them in new ways so that these {{vehicles are}} not over-penalized by legacy standards but still provide the level of safety expected from flight vehicles in today’s environment. In recognition of the progression of many of these vehicles from demonstrator, to limited operational vehicles, to fully operational vehicles, these guidelines were developed to progress through these stages in development and build the qualification tests of previous stages so that none need to be repeated but all contribute to the full qualification of the vehicle when it is accepted into fully operational flight. Finally, to ensure an equivalent level of safety for all UAVs to today’s manned vehicles, these guidelines must accommodate not only the vehicle, its speeds, its mass, and its operating system, but its weaponry, its lethality to both air and ground personnel (especially in crash situations), and its flight regime or airspace (be it restricted, controlled, or unrestricted). All of these factors have influenced the formation of the categories and qualification recommendations summarized in this report. This report is the work of many individuals from the NATO nations represented within AVT- 174, and reflects dialogue with qualification authorities for both military and civilian airspace. These guidelines assume that UAVs will one day have full authority to fly in international airspaces shared with manned aircraft under rules and regulations that assure equivalent safety to those applied to manned aircraft...|$|R
40|$|The SHarp Edge Flight EXperiment (SHEFEX) is a DLR {{program to}} {{investigate}} aerodynamic behaviour and thermal protection problems of re-entry vehicles at hypersonic velocities, using unconventional shapes comprising multi-facetted surfaces with sharp edges. SHEFEX 1 was launched on a parabolic trajectory from Andøya Rocket Range in 2005 {{to provide a}} <b>re-entry</b> <b>velocity</b> {{in the order of}} Mach 7. To obtain greater velocities in the order of Mach 10, without reducing the experiment time, a larger vehicle and a flatter re-entry trajectory are required. A Brazilian VS 40 motor system will be used, whereby the S 40 first stage will provide a conventional spin stabilized unguided flight, but a pitch down precession manoeuvre of the S 44 second stage will be performed prior to its ignition above the atmosphere. This will result in a suppressed trajectory and a re-entry angle of the order of 40 degrees. In addition to the thermal protection experiments, a canard system will provide data on the aerodynamic control parameters at hypersonic velocities. A further experiment comprises a separate inertial navigation system with a star reference update and GPS, which should determine the instantaneous flight vector and provide fine corrections to the main payload attitude control system to reduce any angle of attack inaccuracy...|$|E
40|$|The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) {{recently}} completed their Hayabusa asteroid exploration mission. Launched in 2003, Hayabusa made contact with, and retrieved a sample from, the near-Earth asteroid Itokawa in 2005. The sample return capsule (SRC) re-entered over the Woomera Test Range (WTR) in southern Australia on June 13, 2010, at approximately 11 : 21 pm local time (09 : 51 UTC). The SRC <b>re-entry</b> <b>velocity</b> was 12. 2 km/s, {{making it the}} second-fastest Earth return velocity behind NASA s Stardust sample return capsule re-entry in 2006. From a space technology development perspective, Hayabusa s re-entry functioned as a rare flight experiment of an entry vehicle and its thermal protection system. In collaboration with the SETI Institute, NASA deployed its DC- 8 airborne laboratory {{and a team of}} international researchers to Australia to observe the re-entry of the SRC. The use of an airborne platform enables observation above most clouds and weather and greatly diminishes atmospheric absorption of the optical signals. The DC- 8 s flight path was engineered and flown to provide a view of the spacecraft that bracketed the heat pulse to the capsule. A suite of imaging instruments on board the DC- 8 successfully recorded the luminous portion of the re-entry event. For approximately 70 seconds, the spectroscopic and radiometric instruments acquired images and spectra of the capsule, its wake, and destructive re-entry of the spacecraft bus. Figure 1 shows a perspective view of the WTR, the SRC re-entry trajectory, and the flight path of the DC- 8. The SRC was jettisoned from the spacecraft bus approximately 3 hours prior to entry interface. Due to thruster failures on the spacecraft, it could not be diverted from the entry path and followed the trajectory of the SRC, where it burned up in the atmosphere between approximately 100 and 50 km altitude. Fortuitously, the separation distance between the spacecraft and SRC was sufficient to clearly resolve the SRC from the debris field of the burning spacecraft. Figure 2 shows a frame from a high-definition television camera on board the aircraft and denotes the locations of the SRC and spacecraft bus debris...|$|E
2500|$|Kelly Johnson, {{founder of}} Lockheed Skunk Works, and {{developer}} of the U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird family of spy planes, commented on escape crew capsules when discussing {{development of the}} YF-12A (Blackbird) ejection seat: [...] "We set ourselves a very high goal in providing crew escape systems. We were determined to develop a system good for zero escape velocity {{on the ground and}} through the complete flight spectrum, having speeds above Mach 3 at 100,000 feet. We did achieve our design goals.... I have never been convinced that a capsule ejection is required for anything other than high <b>velocity</b> <b>re-entry</b> from outer space. Our escape system in a very important sense really provides a capsule, which is the pressure suit, which is surely capable of meeting the speeds and temperatures likely to be encountered in the near future of manned aircraft." [...] Rather than using escape capsules, SR-71 and U-2 pilots wore full pressure suits for high-altitude ejections. The suits were also heat-resistant so that SR-71 pilots could survive the high temperatures generated from a Mach 3 ejection.|$|R
40|$|Most {{re-entry}} vehicles utilize a Descent and Landing System (DLS) {{for a safe}} descent through the lowest part of the atmosphere. It usually requires deployment in a certain suitable range of flight conditions, which has to be estimated by limited means of navigation. This paper presents a comparison of currently used trigger methods and triggering algorithms {{which are based on}} correlation between in-flight measurements and the DLS triggering conditions, where the correlations have been extracted by multiple Monte Carlo campaigns. This approach gives a significant improvement of triggering accuracy over direct measurements for a ballistic re-entry. Also a lateral g-load safety trigger is developed to prevent the angle of attack oscillation escalation. Furthermore a sensor sensitivity analysis is performed for a lifting entry trajectory in order to support an upcoming ESA <b>re-entry</b> mission.

40|$|For Earth <b>re-entry</b> at <b>velocities</b> between 8 and 11. 5 km/s, the {{accuracy}} of NASA's computational uid dynamic and radiative simulations of non-equilibrium shock layer radiation is assessed through comparisons with measurements. These measurements were obtained in the NASA Ames Research Center's Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) facility. The experiments were aimed at measuring the spatially and spectrally resolved radiance at relevant entry conditions for both an approximate Earth atmosphere (79 % N 2 : 21 % O 2 by mole) {{as well as a}} more accurate composition featuring the trace species Ar and CO 2 (78. 08 % N 2 : 20. 95 % O 2 : 0. 04 % CO 2 : 0. 93 % Ar by mole). The experiments were configured to target a wide range of conditions, of which shots from 8 to 11. 5 km/s at 0. 2 Torr (26. 7 Pa) are examined in this paper. The non-equilibrium component was chosen to be the focus of this study as it can account for a significant percentage of the emitted radiation for Earth re-entry, and more importantly, non-equilibrium has traditionally been assigned a large uncertainty for vehicle design. The main goals of this study are to present the shock tube data {{in the form of a}} non-equilibrium metric, evaluate the level of agreement between the experiment and simulations, identify key discrepancies and to examine critical aspects of modeling non-equilibrium radiating flows. Radiance pro les integrated over discreet wavelength regions, ranging from the Vacuum Ultra Violet (VUV) through to the Near Infra-Red (NIR), were compared in order to maximize both the spectral coverage and the number of experiments that could be used in the analysis. A previously defined non-equilibrium metric has been used to allow comparisons with several shots and reveal trends in the data. Overall, LAURA/HARA is shown to under-predict EAST by as much as 40 % and over-predict by as much as 12 % depending on the shock speed. DPLR/NEQAIR is shown to under-predict EAST by as much as 50 % and over-predict by as much as 20 % depending on the shock speed. The one standard deviation scatter in the EAST results was calculated to be 31 %. An estimate for the upper bound of the absolute error in wall-directed heat flux was calculated. Below 9 km/s, where the relative difference is large, the absolute error in radiative heat flux due to non-equilibrium models is estimated to be less then 1 W/sq cm. At the highest shock speed of 11 km/s, the error in non-equilibrium is estimated to be less than 20 W/sq cm...|$|R
40|$|Most {{re-entry}} vehicles utilize a Descent and Landing System (DLS) {{for a safe}} descent through the lowest part of the atmosphere.

The investigation performed is a comparison of currently used trigger methods and triggering algorithms {{which are based on}} correlation between in-flight measurements and the DLS triggering conditions for a ballistic re-entry vehicle, where the correlations have been extracted by multiple Monte Carlo campaigns. This approach gives an improvement of the estimation of the deployment conditions of a factor of two over direct measurements of the Mach number. The Mach number is determined to be the most critical parameter for the parachute deployment, because its opening range is the smallest compared to the dynamic pressure and the altitude. Furthermore a sensor sensitivity analysis is performed for a lifting entry trajectory in order to support an upcoming ESA <b>re-entry</b> mission. The <b>velocity</b> drift appears to be the dominant dispersion by a factor ten for the Mach estimation, if the Mach estimation is performed by estimating the drag using axial deceleration measurements. Such a method is the preferred method for the estimation of the deployment conditions, because it has an expected error of less than Mach 0. 1. For the lifting-re-entry mission, a strategy was developed to have redundant parachute deployment triggering if a certain system on the vehicle fails. This strategy involves the use of an Inertial Measurement Unit, Global Positioning System measurements and as last resort, a static pressure probe. Furthermore it appeared that the vehicle can estimate its state using no inputs from the guidance navigation and control system for four minutes. Finally a case study has been performed to investigate the possibility to reduce the footprint by a dynamic parachute opening window. This has found to be ineffective on Earth, but could be effective for Mars re-entry using a parachute able to deploy beyond Mach 2. 5, which would reduce the footprint 15 to 25 kilometers if the NASA MER missions are used as a reference; this would be a reduction of 30 to 50 % of the footprints of current missions. A higher opening velocity is already desired {{in order to be able}} to land on the Martian highlands. Modified parachute designs can be developed to incorporate both benefits.
