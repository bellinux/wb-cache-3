50|$|Tape <b>drive</b> <b>reel</b> hub: When IBM {{introduced}} {{a new form of}} tape <b>drive</b> <b>reel</b> hub using a latch mechanism to replace the older screw-on hub, failure reports began to come in from the field. Improvements were made to the design and subjected to extensive testing with periodic inspections. Initially, the testing was performed manually by repeated mounting and dismounting a tape reel, with everyone in the Lab (Poughkeepsie) assigned a number of operations, including the Lab Director. Eventually, a robot was constructed to perform these exhausting tests.|$|R

5000|$|Quarter inch {{cartridge}} tape (abbreviated QIC, commonly pronounced [...] "quick") is {{a magnetic}} tape data storage format introduced by 3M in 1972, with derivatives {{still in use}} as of 2016. QIC comes in a rugged enclosed package of aluminum and plastic that holds two tape <b>reels</b> <b>driven</b> by a single belt {{in direct contact with}} the tape. The tape was originally 1/4 in wide and anywhere from 300 to 1500 ft long. Data is written linearly {{along the length of the}} tape in one track (mostly on pre-1980 equipment), or it is serialized and written [...] "serpentine" [...] one track at a time, the drive reversing direction at the end of the tape, each track's data written in the opposite direction to its neighbor. Since the introduction of QIC, it has been widely used and many variations exist. There is a QIC trade association that publishes QIC standards which include interfaces and logical formats. To a very large extent it was the efficiency and openness of this organization which encouraged hardware and software developers to use this type of drive and media.|$|R

40|$|The main {{consideration}} of any reeling {{system is the}} effect it has on cable tensions and hence cable life. This paper explains the relationship of reel torque to cable tensions and the reasons why this relationship is so important. Such system is characterized by variable parameters, primarily a variable moment of inertia and a variable diameter of the coiled cable. For these reasons, {{in order to ensure}} proper dimensioning of the drive, it is necessary to know the motor torques that need to be developed {{as a function of the}} coiled cable. The motor should be able to develop the required torques in a very wide speed range. It is shown that for properly sizing the motor it is necessary take into account the dynamics of the cable <b>reel</b> <b>drive.</b> In this paper monospiral motorized cable reel for winding power cable in crane applications with frequency converter fed induction motor is analyzed.

To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of tape recorders operating under severe vibration, acceleration, and shock environments, two new flutter reduction design concepts have been developed: 1. Capstan servoing during the recording process to servo out flutter before it is recorded. 2. A new <b>reel</b> <b>drive</b> {{system in which the}} reels are coupled together to minimize tape tension variations and eliminate the possibility of throwing a tape loop. Test data on a prototype spaceborne recorder has proven the validity of the concept.

50|$|The QIC {{cartridge}} {{is distinguished}} from {{other types of}} tape cartridges {{by the fact that}} it contains an endless drive belt which is moved at a uniform speed by a motorised capstan. Since the belt is in contact with the tape, this ensures both that the tape moves at uniform speed, and that neutral tension is maintained at all times. This is in contrast to cassette tapes or DATs where the tape is moved past the head by a capstan and pinch wheel, but the takeup <b>reel</b> is <b>driven</b> by a servo motor or slipping clutch.|$|R
40|$|The {{tethered}} satellite control mechanisms consist of four major subsystems. The <b>reel</b> <b>drive</b> mechanism stores the tether. It is motor driven {{and includes a}} level wind to uniformly feed the tether to the reel. The lower boom mechanism serves two primary functions: (1) it measures tether length and velocity as the tether runs through the mechanism, and (2) it reads the tether tension at the reel. It also provides change the direction for the tether from the reel to the upper boom mechanism. The deployment boom positions the upper boom mechanism with satellite out of the cargo bay. The deployment function places the 500 -kg satellite 20 m away from the Space Shuttle (producing a small natural gravity gradient force), impacts an initial velocity to the satellite for deployment, and allows for satellite docking {{at a safe distance}} from the body of the Space Shuttle. The upper boom mechanism (UBM) services three functions: (1) it provides tether control to the satellite as the satellite swings in and out of plane; (2) it reads tether tension in the low range during the early deployment and final retrieval parts of the mission; and (3) it produces additional tether tension at the reel when tether tension to the satellite is in the low range...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 18 - 20, 1966 / Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe {{need for}} large bit {{capacity}} in on-board data storage for deep-space probes, spacecraft, satellites, and aircraft, {{has created a}} requirement for a tape recorder of ultra-high reliability. In an ideal recorder, the conventional capstan would be eliminated and the <b>reels</b> would be <b>driven</b> such that the linear velocity and the tension of the tape between reels would be constant {{from the beginning to}} the end of the reel. The heads would also be the only elements in contact with the tape. Reliability would be enhanced by driving the reels, rather than the tape, through a reduction in the number of moving parts. Reducing the number of elements in contact with the tape would also increase tape life. The Iso-Elastic Drive, closely approaches the ideal recorder <b>drive</b> system. The <b>reels</b> are <b>driven</b> by a seamless polyester belt which is in direct contact with the periphery of the tape reel. The belt is driven at constant linear velocity (resulting in low flutter) and in such a manner that it generates a constant tension in the tape connecting the two reels and passing across the heads. Constant tape tension in a high-reliability recorder is necessary in order to optimize 1) tape tracking and guidance, 2) effective bias level on the tape during direct-type recording, 3) playback level, 4) head wear, and 5) drop-outs. The Iso-Elastic Drive reduces the number of moving parts by approximately 30 % as compared with conventional recorders. The tape drive has the additional desirable characteristic of operation equally well in either direction...|$|R

40|$|The multipurpose, multiaxial, {{isokinetic}} dynamometer (MMID) is a {{computer-controlled system}} of exercise machinery {{that can serve}} as a means for quantitatively assessing a subject s muscle coordination, range of motion, strength, and overall physical condition with respect {{to a wide variety of}} forces, motions, and exercise regimens. The MMID is easily reconfigurable and compactly stowable and, in comparison with prior computer-controlled exercise systems, it weighs less, costs less, and offers more capabilities. Whereas a typical prior isokinetic exercise machine is limited to operation in only one plane, the MMID can operate along any path. In addition, the MMID is not limited to the isokinetic (constant-speed) mode of operation. The MMID provides for control and/or measurement of position, force, and/or speed of exertion in as many as six degrees of freedom simultaneously; hence, it can accommodate more complex, more nearly natural combinations of motions and, in so doing, offers greater capabilities for physical conditioning and evaluation. The MMID (see figure) includes as many as eight active modules, each of which can be anchored to a floor, wall, ceiling, or other fixed object. A cable is payed out from a reel in each module to a bar or other suitable object that is gripped and manipulated by the subject. The <b>reel</b> is <b>driven</b> by a DC brushless motor or other suitable electric motor via a gear reduction unit. The motor can be made to function as either a driver or an electromagnetic brake, depending on the required nature of the interaction with the subject. The module includes a force and a displacement sensor for real-time monitoring of the tension in and displacement of the cable, respectively. In response to commands from a control computer, the motor can be operated to generate a required tension in the cable, to displace the cable a required distance, or to reel the cable in or out at a required speed. The computer can be programmed, either locally or via a remote terminal, to support exercises in one or more of the usual exercise modes (isometric, isokinetic, or isotonic) along complex, multiaxis trajectories. The motions of, and forces applied by, the subject can be monitored in real time and recorded for subsequent evaluation. Through suitable programming, the exercise can be adjusted in real time according to the physical condition of the subject. The remote- programming capability makes it possible to connect multiple exercise machines into a network for supervised exercise by multiple subjects or even for competition by geographically dispersed subjects...|$|R
40|$|Geothermal {{heat flow}} {{measurements}} are {{a high priority}} for the future lunar geophysical network missions recommended by the latest Decadal Survey and previously the International Lunar Network. Because the lander for such a mission will be relatively small, the heat flow instrumentation must be a low-mass and low-power system. The instrument needs to measure both thermal gradient and thermal conductivity of the regolith penetrated. It also needs to be capable of excavating a deep enough hole (approx. 3 m) to avoid the effect of potential long-term changes of the surface thermal environment. The recently developed pneumatic excavation system can largely meet the low-power, low-mass, and the depth requirements. The system utilizes a stem which winds out of a pneumatically <b>driven</b> <b>reel</b> and pushes its conical tip into the regolith. Simultaneously, gas jets, emitted from the cone tip, loosen and blow away the soil. The thermal sensors consist of resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) embedded on the stem and an insitu thermal conductivity probe attached to the cone tip. The thermal conductivity probe consists of a short 'needle' (2. 4 -mm diam. and 15 - to 20 -mm length) that contains a platinum RTD wrapped in a coil of heater wire. During a deployment, when the penetrating cone reaches a desired depth, it stops blowing gas, and the stem pushes the needle into the yet-to-be excavated, undisturbed bottom soil. Then, it begins heating and monitors the temperature. Thermal conductivity of the soil can determined from the rate of temperature increase with time. When the measurement is complete, the system resumes excavation until it reaches the next targeted depth...|$|R
5000|$|The skeins {{were placed}} into bales {{and taken to}} the mill for processing. Three sorts of yarn were {{commonly}} produced: no-twist which was suitable for weft, tram that had received a slight twist {{making it easier to}} handle, and organizine which had a greater twist and was suitable for use as warp. [...] Reeling is the process where the silk that has been wound into skeins, is cleaned, receives a twist and is wound onto bobbins. Silk throwing is the process where the filament from the bobbins is given its full twist. The process where filaments or threads from three or more bobbins are wound together is called doubling.The last two processes can occur more than once and in any order. Tram was wound, thrown and doubled, organzine was wound, doubled then thrown and doubled again. Sewing silk could receive further doubling and throwing. No-twist was often three single filaments doubled together. Many other combinations were possible. Colloquially silk throwing can be used to refer to the whole process: reeling, throwing and doubling, and silk throwsters would speak of throwing as twisting or spinning. Silk throwing was originally a hand process relying on a turning a wheel (the gate) that twisted four threads while a helper who would be a child, ran the length of a shade, hooked the threads on stationary pins (the cross) and ran back to start the process again. The shade would be a between 23 and 32m long. The process was described in detail to Lord Shaftesbury's Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Employment of Children in 1841:For twisting it is necessary to have what are designated shades which are buildings of at least 30 or 35 yards in length, of two or more rooms, rented separately by one,two or four men having one gate and a boy called a helper... the upper storey is generally occupied by children, young persons or grown women as 'piecers', 'winders' and 'doublers' attending to their <b>reels</b> and bobbins, <b>driven</b> by the exertions of one man... He (the boy) takes first a rod containing four bobbins of silk from the twister who stands at his gate or wheel, and having fastened the ends, runs to the 'cross' at the extreme end of the room, round which he passes the threads of each bobbin and returns to the 'gate'. He is despatched on a second expedition of the same kind, and returns as before, he then runs up to the cross and detaches the threads and comes to the roller. Supposing the master to make twelve rolls a day, the boy necessarily runs fourteen miles, and this is barefooted.|$|R
40|$|Geothermal {{heat flow}} {{measurements}} are {{a high priority}} for the future lunar geophysical network missions recommended by the latest Decadal Survey of the National Academy. Geothermal heat flow is obtained as a product of two separate measurements of geothermal gradient and thermal conductivity of the regolith/soil interval penetrated by the instrument. The Apollo 15 and 17 astronauts deployed their heat flow probes down to 1. 4 -m and 2. 3 -m depths, respectively, using a rotary-percussive drill. However, recent studies show that the heat flow instrument for a lunar mission should be capable of excavating a ~ 3 -m deep hole to avoid the effect of potential long-term changes of the surface thermal environment. For a future robotic geophysical mission, a system that utilizes a rotary/percussive drill would far exceed the limited payload and power capacities of the lander/rover. Therefore, we are currently developing a more compact heat flow system that is capable of 3 -m penetration. Because the grains of lunar regolith are cohesive and densely packed, the previously proposed lightweight, internal hammering systems (the so-called moles) are not likely to achieve the desired deep penetration. The excavation system for our new heat flow instrumentation utilizes a stem which winds out of a pneumatically <b>driven</b> <b>reel</b> and pushes its conical tip into the regolith. Simultaneously, gas jets, emitted from the cone tip, loosen and blow away the soil. Lab tests have demonstrated that this proboscis system has much greater excavation capability than a mole-based heat flow system, while it weighs about the same. Thermal sensors are attached along the stem and {{at the tip of the}} penetrating cone. Thermal conductivity is measured at the cone tip with a short (1 - to 1. 5 -cm long) needle sensor containing a resistance temperature detector (RTD) and a heater wire. When it is inserted into the soil, the heater is activated. Thermal conductivity of the soil is obtained from the rate of temperature increase during the heating. By stopping during the excavation, it is possible to measure thermal conductivities at different depths. The gas jets are turned off when the penetrating cone reaches the target depth. Then, the stem pushes the needle sensor into the undisturbed soil at the bottom of the hole and carries out a thermal conductivity measurement. When the measurement is complete, the system resumes excavation. RTDs, placed along the stem at short (approx 30 cm) intervals, will monitor long-term temperature stability of the subsurface. Temperature in the shallow subsurface would fluctuate with the diurnal, annual, and precession cycles of the Moon. These thermal waves penetrate to different depths into the regolith. Longterm monitoring of the subsurface temperature would allow us to accurately delineate these cyclic signals and separate them from the signal associated with the outward flow of the Moon s endogenic heat. Further, temperature toward bottom of the 3 -m hole should be fairly stable after the heat generated during the excavation dissipates into the surrounding soil. The geothermal gradient may be determined reliably from temperature measurements at the RTDs near the bottom. In order to minimize the heat conduction along the stem from affecting the geothermal gradient measurements, we plan to use low-conductive materials for the stem and develop a mechanism to achieve close coupling between the RTDs and the wall of the excavated hole...|$|R
