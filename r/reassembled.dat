40|$|The <b>reassembling</b> of {{a simple}} {{connected}} graph G = (V,E) is an abstraction of a problem arising in earlier studies of network analysis. The <b>reassembling</b> process has a simple formulation (there are several equivalent formulations) relative to a binary tree B (<b>reassembling</b> tree), with root node {{at the top and}} $n$ leaf nodes at the bottom, where every cross-section corresponds to a partition of V such that: - the bottom (or first) cross-section (all the leaves) is the finest partition of V with n one-vertex blocks, - the top (or last) cross-section (the root) is the coarsest partition with a single block, the entire set V, - a node (or block) in an intermediate cross-section (or partition) is the result of merging its two children nodes (or blocks) in the cross-section (or partition) below it. The maximum edge-boundary degree encountered during the <b>reassembling</b> process is what we call the alpha-measure of the <b>reassembling,</b> and the sum of all edge-boundary degrees is its beta-measure. The alpha-optimization (resp. beta-optimization) of the <b>reassembling</b> of G is to determine a <b>reassembling</b> tree B that minimizes its alpha-measure (resp. beta-measure). There are different forms of <b>reassembling.</b> In an earlier report, we studied linear <b>reassembling,</b> which is the case when the height of B is (n- 1). In this report, we study balanced <b>reassembling,</b> when B has height [log n]. The two main results in this report are the NP-hardness of alpha-optimization and beta-optimization of balanced <b>reassembling.</b> The first result is obtained by a sequence of polynomial-time reductions from minimum bisection of graphs (known to be NP-hard), and the second by a sequence of polynomial-time reductions from clique cover of graphs (known to be NP-hard) ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>reassembling</b> of {{a simple}} {{connected}} graph G = (V, E) is an abstraction of a problem arising in earlier studies of network analysis. Its simplest formulation is in two steps: (1) We cut every edge of G into two halves, thus obtaining a collection of n = ∣ V ∣ one-vertex components, such that for every v ∈ V the one-vertex component {v} has ∣ degree(v) ∣ half edges attached to it. (2) We splice {{the two halves of}} every edge together, not of all the edges at once, but in some ordering Θ of the edges that minimizes two measures that depend on the edge-boundary degrees of assembled components. A component A is a subset of V and its edge-boundary degree is the number of edges in G with one endpoint in A and one endpoint in V − A (which {{is the same as the}} number of half edges attached to A after all edges with both endpoints in A have been spliced together). The maximum edge-boundary degree encountered during the <b>reassembling</b> process is what we call the α-measure of the <b>reassembling,</b> and the sum of all edge-boundary degrees is its β-measure. The α-optimization (resp. β-optimization) of the <b>reassembling</b> of G is to determine an ordering Θ for splicing the edges that minimizes its α-measure (resp. β-measure). There are different forms of <b>reassembling,</b> depending on restrictions and variations on the ordering Θ of the edges. We consider only cases satisfying the condition that if the an edge between disjoint components A and B is spliced, then all the edges between A and B are spliced at the same time. In this report, we examine the particular case of linear <b>reassembling,</b> which requires that the next edge to be spliced must be adjacent to an already spliced edge. We delay other forms of <b>reassembling</b> to follow-up reports. We prove that α-optimization of linear <b>reassembling</b> and minimum-cutwidth linear arrangment (CutWidth) are polynomially reducible to each other, and that β-optimization of linear <b>reassembling</b> and minimum-cost linear arrangement (MinArr) are polynomially reducible to each other. The known NP-hardness of CutWidth and MinArr imply the NP-hardness of α-optimization and β-optimization...|$|R

Although the team wanted to return home immediately, Seddon insisted. The All Blacks had two weeks before they departed. Many of them stayed with friends of relatives, while Stead and Gallaher wrote The Complete Rugby Footballer.

5|$|During {{the night}} of 15 December, {{the main body of}} the High Seas Fleet {{encountered}} British destroyers. Fearing the prospect of a nighttime torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat. Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's reversal, and so he continued with the bombardment. Upon reaching the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into two groups. Derfflinger and Von der Tann went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby while Seydlitz, Moltke, and Blücher went north to shell Hartlepool. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had <b>reassembled,</b> and they began to retreat eastward.|$|E

The vessel was painted white, and a gold eagle painted on the bow. The ship's reconstruction took nearly four years. Marjorie Merriweather Post retained ownership of Sea Cloud in the aftermath of her divorce from Mr. Davies, since she had originally brought the ship into the marriage. After evaluating the cost of running a year-round crew of seventy-two, Marjorie Merriweather Post decided to sell the ship.|$|E
