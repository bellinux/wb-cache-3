Precision hard milling is an efficiency way to machine 30 Cr 3 instead of grinding. <b>Rounded</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radius has important {{influence on the}} machining process due to small depth of cut. In order to better understanding the influence of <b>rounded</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radius, cutting forces, cutting temperature, critical depth of cut, etc., is analyzed by using finite element method (FEM). The results show that cutting forces in the y direction are more sensitively to the <b>rounded</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radii. Ploughing effect is also observed {{at the end of}} the climb milling process and it has significant influence on the quality of the machined surface.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a cutting force model for the micro-end-milling processes under various cutting conditions using a hybrid approach. Firstly, a finite element (FE) model of orthogonal micro-cutting with a <b>round</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is developed for medium-carbon steel. A number of finite element analyses (FEA) are performed at different uncut chip thicknesses and velocities. Based on the FEA results, the cutting force coefficients are extracted through a nonlinear algorithm to establish a relationship with the uncut chip thickness and cutting speed. Then, the cutting force coefficients are integrated into a mechanistic cutting force model, which can predict cutting forces under different cutting conditions. In order to account for the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> effect, an effective rake angle is employed for the determination of the cutting force. A comparison of the prediction and experimental measured cutting forces has shown that the developed method provides accurate results. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a micro optical probe, which is employed to evaluate edge contours of single point diamond tools {{with a size}} {{in a range of}} several millimetres. The micro optical probe consists of a laser source with a wavelength of 405 nm, an objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0. 25, a photodiode for measurement, and a compensating optical system including another photodiode for compensation of laser intensity. A collimated laser beam, which is divided by a beam splitter in the compensating optical system, is focused by the objective lens so that the focused spot can be used as the micro optical probe. The micro optical probe traces over an edge contour of an objective tool while the signals of both the two photodiodes are monitored. The output of the photodiode for measurement is compensated by using that of the photodiode for laser intensity compensation to eliminate the influence of the laser instability. The signal of the photodiode for measurement is used to define the deviation of edge contour within the diameter of the micro optical probe. To verify the feasibility of the developed optical probe, the optical system was mounted on a diamond turning machine, and some experiments were carried out. Two types of edge contours of the diamond tools having a straight <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> and a <b>round</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> were measured on the machine...|$|R

The results of the experimental study of specific contact load distribution over the artificial flank wear-land of the cutter in free orthogonal turning of the disk from titanium alloy (Ti[6]Al[2]Mo[2]Cr), ductile (63 Cu) and brittle (57 Cu 1 Al[3]Mn) brasses are described. Investigations were {{carried out by the}} method of 'split cutter' and by the method of the artificial flank-land of variable width. The experiments with a variable feed rate and a cutting speed show that in titanium alloy machining with a sharp-cornered cutting edge the highest normal contact load ([sigma][h max]= 3400 [...] . 2200 MPa) is observed immediately at the cutting edge, and the curve has a horizontal region with the length of 0. 2 [...] . 0. 6 mm.

The character of normal contact load for a <b>rounded</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is different -it is uniform, and its value is approximately 2 times smaller compared to machining with a sharp-cornered cutting edge.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} new methodologies {{to improve}} the simulation of the orthogonal cutting of unidirectional carbon fibre reinforced plastic (UD-CFRP) composites. In a meso-scale approach, a new cohesive model was developed to overcome the excessive deformations shown by the generally implemented zero thickness cohesive elements. The smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approach was implemented to avoid element deletion during the analysis, {{taking place in the}} commonly used finite element method (FEM). The SPH enabled better prediction of the thrust force, more realistic chip formation mechanisms and the capability to simulate the bouncing back. However, the absence of a cohesive layer did not permit the collection of information on the interface behaviour. Therefore, a hybrid model, based on the FEM to SPH conversion, was deployed to introduce a cohesive layer, while avoiding element deletion. In-house experiments were conducted for validating the hybrid model. The hybrid approach consented implementation of the novel cohesive model while improving the thrust force prediction when compared with the FEM.

40|$|Abstract: High speed {{machining}} (HSM) may produces {{parts with}} substantially higher fatigue strength; increased subsurface micro-hardness and plastic deformation, mostly {{due to the}} ploughing of the <b>round</b> <b>cutting</b> tool <b>edge</b> associated with induced stresses, and can have far more superior surface properties than surfaces generated by grinding and polishing. Cutting edge roundness may induce stress and temperature fields on the machined subsurface and influence the finished surface properties as well as tool life. In this paper, a Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling approach with Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) fully coupled thermal-stress analysis is employed. In order to realistically simulate high speed machining using edge design tools, an FEM model for orthogonal cutting is designed and solution techniques such as adaptive meshing, and explicit dynamics are performed. Work material flow around the round edge-cutting tool is successfully simulated without implementing a chip separation criterion and {{without the use of}} a remeshing scheme. FEM simulations for machining-induced stresses by <b>round</b> <b>edge</b> <b>cutting</b> tools are performed for high speed machining of AISI AISI 4340 steel. Once FEM simulations are complete for different edge radii and depth of cuts, tool is unloaded and stresses are relieved. Stress fields are compared with experimentally measured residual stresses obtain from literature. The results indicate that the round edge design tools influence the stress and temperature fields greatly...|$|R

This paper presents the laws of glass crack initiation and propagation when a cylindric indenter is used for glass indention.

A coupled thermal-mechanical {{model of}} plane-strain {{orthogonal}} metal cutting with continuous chip formation is developed {{to investigate the}} residual stresses in the finished workpiece. Deformation of the workpiece material is treated as elastic-viscoplastic with isotropic strain hardening, and the numerical solution accounts for coupling between plastic deformation and the temperature field, including treatment of temperature-dependent material properties. Automatic continuous remeshing and adaptive meshing technique are employed to achieve chip separation at the tool tip region and a satisfactory solution. The finite element model is well validated by comparing values of the predicted cutting forces and residual stresses with experimental results. Based on the established finite element model, the effect of <b>rounded</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radius on residual stress distribution is analyzed. The results show that altered cutting edge radius clearly produced significant changes in residual stresses. The maximum tensile residual stress and its penetration depth decrease as the cutting edge radius increases...|$|E

Each has been the basis for assumptions in previous studies which attempt to model the machining process, but no direct comparison had been made to determine which, if either, is an appropriate model. One model assumes that a separation point exists on the <b>rounded</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> while the other includes a stable build-up adhered to the edge and assumes a separation point at the outer extreme of the build-up. Theories of elastic-plastic deformation are employed to develop force predictions based on each model, and experiments are performed on 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloy to evaluate modeling success. The experiments utilize unusually large cutting edge radii to isolate the edge component of the total cutting forces. Results suggest that a material separation point on the tool itself does not exist and that the model that includes a stable build-up works better to describe the experimental observations...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{driver in}} research activities of manufacturers and university institutions is {{the improvement of}} tool life for cutting tools.

Different technologies are used for substrate pre-treatment, depending on the machining task, flexibility of the process and economic aspects. However regarding the surface quality two opposing requirements come into conflict.

30|$|Although the {{machining}} {{quality of the}} R-WC milling cutter is worse {{than that of the}} F-WC one, it performs longer tool lifetime, due to the lower probability of tipping failure dependent on the relatively <b>rounder</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge.</b> The tool lifetimes of the UMCD, AFM-UMCD, BDMCD, AFM-BDMCD and BDM-UFGCD specimens are zero or almost zero, because they cannot meet the requirements of {{the machining}} quality at the very beginning stages of the milling processes. The UFGD and BDFGD coated milling cutters either before or after AFM show slightly prolonged tool lifetimes than the uncoated ones, because the rapid fracture and removal of the nano-sized diamond films associated with their poor adhesion will cause the deterioration of the machining quality, especially for the UFGD and BDFGD coated milling cutters before AFM, the machining quality of which approaches the threshold value at the very beginning stages (Rz = 1.54 μm for UFGD and Rz = 1.47 μm for BDFGD). It is proved that the boron doping can enhance the adhesion between the diamond film and the substrate, and there are favorable mechanical interlocks between micro-sized diamond grains and the substrate [45], therefore, the BDM-UFGCD film has not only low surface roughness but also nice adhesion. It is speculated that the AFM hardly influences the adhesion of as-deposited diamond films, so the AFM-BDM-UFGCD specimen presents a tool lifetime almost four times longer than the R-WC. Considering that the AFM-BDM-UFGCD specimen can provide favorable machining quality (Rz = 1.18 μm) approaching to the uncoated milling cutters (Rz = 0.85 μm for F-WC and Rz = 0.96 μm for R-WC), and it is efficient to polish its surface by AFM, the BDM-UFGCD coated milling cutter after AFM is recognized as an important candidate for finish milling the Al alloy.|$|R

The described methods to analyze the influences of edge shape modifications will contribute to the optimization of drilling tools. Based on a specific cutting edge shape of a drill, systematic changes to the edge were made. Forces and temperatures on the cutting edge were measured as well as the heat flow into the chips and the workpiece. Using a quick-stop device, length and type of chip for the different drills under various machining parameters were observed. It could be shown that the modification of the transition from the chisel to the cutting edge influences the stress developed, heat in chip and chip formation. Machining with a <b>rounded</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> shape compared to a sharp edge reduces the mechanical load but slightly increases thermal tool load.
