The greatest men have been those who have stepped out from the mass, and gone beyond their time--seeing things, with eyesight almost divine, which have hitherto been hidden from the crowd. Such was Columbus {{when he made his}} way across the Western Ocean; such were Galileo and Bacon; such was Pythagoras, if the ideas we have of him be at all true. Such also was Cicero. It is not given to the age in which such men live to know them. Could their age even recognize them, they would not overstep their age as they do. Looking back at him now, we can see how like a Christian was the man--so like, that in essentials we can hardly see the difference. He could love another as himself--as nearly as a man may do; and he taught such love as a doctrine.[28] He believed in the existence of one supreme God.[29] He believed that man would rise again and live forever in some heaven.[30] I am conscious that I cannot much promote this view of Cicero's character by quoting isolated passages from his works--words which taken alone may be interpreted in one sense or another, and which should be read, each with its context, before their due meaning can be understood.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present the ICSI speaker diarization system {{submitted}} for the NIST Rich Transcription evaluation (RT 06 s) [1] {{conducted on the}} meetings environment. The presented system {{is based on the}} RT 05 s system, which uses agglomerative clustering with a modified Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) measure to decide which pairs of clusters to merge and to determine when to stop merging clusters. In this year’s system we have eliminated any <b>remaining</b> <b>need</b> for training data, therefore increasing robustness. In our primary system we have introduced several improvements from last year. First, we use a new trainingfree speech/non-speech detection algorithm. Second, we introduce a new algorithm for system initialization. The third improvement is the use of a frame purification algorithm to increase cluster discriminability. Finally, we describe the use of inter-channel delays as features. We explain each of these improvements and show our system’s results on the official evaluation data using hand-aligned references and forced-alignments.

The dip has structure on scales of ∼ 1 ◦ to 10 ◦. We suggest that the dip in extragalactic brightness and number counts and the WMAP cold spot are physically related, i. e., that the coincidence is neither a statistical anomaly nor a WMAP foreground correction problem. Since the cold spot originates from structures at modest redshifts, there is no <b>remaining</b> <b>need</b> for non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen statistically for NVSS source counts, may thus be seen to operate on a single region for the first time.

VRES growth predictions according to the official National Renewable Energy Action Plans of the EU countries are used and extrapolated logistically up to a fully VRES-supplied power system. We find that keeping today's international net transfer capacities (NTCs) fixed over the next forty years reduces the final need for backup energy by 13 % {{when compared to the}} situation with no NTCs. An overall doubling of today's NTCs will lead to a 26 % reduction, and an overall quadrupling to a 33 % reduction. The <b>remaining</b> <b>need</b> for backup energy is due to correlations in the generation patterns, and cannot be further reduced by transmission. The main investments in transmission lines are due during the ramp-up of VRES from 15 % (as planned for 2020) to 80 %.

40|$|Buildings consume {{resources}} and produces emissions {{to the environment}} during their life cycle. They consume materials during their construction, maintenance and renovation activities, consume energy and water during their use, and produce waste {{at the end of}} their useful life. There are several sustainable building methods for environmental assessment; the results of these depend on the approach taken and therefore also on the objective or endpoint of the assessment. The most common strategies aim at reducing their impacts, but buildings will always have an environmental load. Therefore, to calculate the absolute damage of a building to the environment, as it is done in the Life Cycle Assessment may be considered inadequate for assessment when the objective is to improve the environmental performance of the building from design. The three step strategy is an option being a method that focuses on a different approach. This strategy establishes that for a sustainable use of resources, three steps are necessary: a) to reduce the need or use of resources, b) to use renewable sources to sustain the need and c) to be efficient with the <b>remaining</b> <b>need.</b> The method has advantages and disadvantages related to accuracy, data needed, output, and interpretation of results.

Design Cross-sectional analysis, using observation cycle 2005 / 2006 of the population-based prospective cohort of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. Setting Municipal registries in three Dutch regions. Participants 1, 908 older adults (mean [standard deviation] age: 71 [8. 87] years; 54 % women). Measurements Sexuality and intimacy were assessed using four questions. Four cognitive domains were assessed: general cognitive functioning (Mini-Mental State Examination), memory performance (Auditory Verbal Learning Test), processing speed (Coding Task), and fluid intelligence (Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices). Multinomial regression analysis was used, with sexuality as outcome. The interaction effect between gender and sexuality was also tested. Results Lower fluid intelligence was associated with perceiving sexuality as unimportant; lower general cognitive functioning was associated with perceiving sexuality as unimportant; and lower immediate memory recall was associated with evaluating sexual life as unpleasant. Associations were also found between lower fluid intelligence, processing speed, and general cognitive functioning, and agreeing with sexuality no longer being important. Lower processing speed, general cognitive functioning, and delayed memory recall were associated with disagreeing with a <b>remaining</b> <b>need</b> for intimacy when getting older. Finally, the association between fluid intelligence and perceiving sexuality as important, and the association between immediate memory recall score and evaluating sexual life as pleasant, was only significant in women.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the environmental performance of construction trends in houses in central Mexico by assessing the type and quantity of material used in construction elements. Design/methodology/approach – Three reference Mexican houses are used for the analysis: a traditional house, a house with mostly masonry elements, and a house with mostly concrete elements. The reference houses indicate the construction trend followed in central Mexico. Quantitative analysis of the types and weights of various materials used to construct the houses is undertaken. The environmental performance is measured according to their sustainability potential. The indicators used are based on the Three Step Strategy, which sets the steps needed to achieve sustainable construction: use fewer materials, use renewable materials and be efficient with the <b>remaining</b> <b>need.</b> Findings – The analysis shows that there is a trend to use faster and cheaper construction processes, which are often concrete and prefabricated elements, especially for dwellings built in series. Although this has the positive impact of decreasing the stress on housing demand, it might have negative impacts on the environment because more energy-intensive and artificial materials are used. In addition, the low homogeneity of these materials decreases the potential of construction elements to be reused or recycled. Research limitations/implications – The findings of this study aim at providing more information to practitioners on the sustainability of material choices during the design process. Thus practitioners will be better informed to design more environmentally sustainable buildings. The results are based on analysis of data from Central Mexico but may have relevance to other parts of the world. Originality/value – The study provides quantitatively derived evidence to support sustainable design decisions...|$|E
40|$|After World War II {{public opinion}} in Sweden {{gradually}} recognised {{the need for a}} crusade against crime {{as a threat to the}} state and its inhabitants. The police and responsibility for public prosecution were nationalised, reorganised and placed within the Ministry of Justice. A new authority was established in the Ministry to investigate crime prevention activities (BRA). A new Code on Judicial Procedure, 1942 (in force 1948) had replaced previous legislation on civil and criminal court procedure. The legislation on crime and penal sanctions was gradually reformed and a new Criminal Code was adopted 1962 (in force 1964). Tort law, which had for long been unco-ordinated was finally collected in the Tort Liability Act, 1972 supplemented by the Criminal Injuries Compensa-tion Act, 1978. These codes and Acts have later been amended, sometimes to the benefit of victims of crime. During this period the need for state compensation to victims of crime slowly attracted special attention. From a cautious beginning in 1948 the state gradually took on responsibility for adjudged economic compensation to the victim, not obtained from the offender. The social welfare system covers costs for medical and social treatment and care and losses by industrial injury etc. Other economic losses are often compensated by the victim's insurance. The <b>remaining</b> <b>need</b> for compensation mainly refers to criminal violation of the victim's integrity and the effects of harm caused by the offence.

40|$|This {{economic}} history dissertation explores a central contradiction within the Swedish welfare state, the contradiction {{of the welfare}} state’s goal to decommodify its citizens from market fluctuations and the constant need for a flexible workforce within the capitalist system. On one hand, the Swedish welfare state during the 20 th century has developed {{into one of the}} most decommodifying welfare state regimes in the world, a welfare state in which the ambition has been to minimize risk and market exposure for its citizens by means of insurance systems covering unemployment, health and pensions. On the other hand, the Swedish welfare state is built upon the premises of capitalism and the need for constant economic growth. According to Karl Marx in Capital, there is always a need for a poor and destitute industrial reserve army within the capitalist society: people who can start working immediately if the market demands it. This dissertation shows that throughout the period studied there have been people who, because of unemployment, have had to turn to means-tested benefits since they were not eligible for relief work or first and foremost unemployment insurance. This is in no way a modern phenomenon, but rather one that has fluctuated with the market over time. The composition of the unemployed on means-tested benefits has also shifted, from older people in forest districts and women, to young males and immigrants. The state has increased its involvement over time and stepped in and increased its subsidies to unemployment funds, as well as developing alternative forms of unemployment schemes. By doing so the state has eased the burden of those who are unemployed but not entitled to unemployment insurance. Since 2001, the requirements facing claimants of unemployment allowance have become stricter with the introduction of workfare. Since 2007, extensive changes in unemployment insurance have left an increasing proportion of the unemployed with only the means-tested allowance to rely on. The Swedish state has managed to ease the burden of being unemployed, but it has in no way managed to overcome the <b>remaining</b> <b>need</b> of an industrial reserve army.

40|$|The recent {{growth of}} Teach For America (TFA) has enabled it to {{substantially}} expand the teacher labour supply in many rural Southern communities, {{one of its}} largest and fastest-growing partnership subsets. Though it is generally accepted that these areas face more severe teacher shortages than most other regions in the country, there is little research as to how these staffing challenges arise or how they might be resolved; TFA’s potential to grow the rural Southern teacher supply thus signals a promising opportunity in need of further research. This work offers {{a case study of}} teacher labour outcomes in the Mississippi-Arkansas Delta, TFA’s oldest and largest rural Southern partnership site. In this region, local schools have experienced a 600 per-cent increase in corps member presence since 2008; consequently, TFA provided anywhere from a quarter to a half of the area’s new teacher labour supply each year from 2008 to 2010. A mixed-methods analysis illuminates both the causes of Delta teacher shortages and TFA’s potential to address these vacancies. Within the Delta, local schools face chronic teacher shortages because the communities they serve are overwhelmingly poor, geographically isolated, and racially segregated. TFA appears to have targeted the Delta communities where teacher labour policies have systematically fallen short, as it partners with districts bearing the greatest share of the region’s aggregate teacher vacancies. Additional statistical testing reveals that amongst these hard-to-staff districts, TFA has further focussed its resources into the schools that serve more rural, less educated, and/or predominantly African American populations. In this way, TFA funnels its corps members into the very districts where state reform efforts have struggled most, thus serving as a powerful resource for realigning ‘sticky’ outcomes in the most hard-to-staff Delta school districts. These findings notwithstanding, closer examination reveals significant drawbacks and limitations to current TFA outcomes in the rural Southern Delta. TFA does not saturate hard-to-staff school districts enough to produce statistically significant changes in local teacher vacancy rates. Instead, the programme appears to have established an unofficial threshold for the number of teachers placed per district; once this ceiling has been reached, additional corps members are funnelled into a new area regardless of the original district’s <b>remaining</b> <b>need.</b> Additionally, there is no long-term ‘exit strategy’ to help Delta districts employing TFA corps members to eventually cultivate their own high-quality teacher labour supply, thus leaving them perpetually dependent on TFA to staff their classrooms. Preliminary evidence suggests that state governments could address these shortcomings through 1) increased financial support for TFA to fully saturate vacancies in current partnership districts, as well as 2) the simultaneous development of grow-your-own teacher certification programmes in rural Delta districts. The evidence suggests that these two strategies would improve TFA as a targeted teacher recruitment strategy for hard-to-staff communities both in the Delta and across the programme’s nine other rural Southern partnership sites.
