In five villages located in various agro climatic regions of the state, 275 farmers cultivated soybean during 1997 - 1999, of which 239 <b>farms</b> had practiced <b>rainfed</b> <b>cultivation.</b> A total of 188 <b>rainfed</b> <b>farms</b> had used a combination of bullock and tractor power (mixed farming), constituting 67. 6 % of the farms surveyed. The energy consumption patterns of these farms were studied and a linear programming technique applied to determine optimal energy resource allocation for maximum yield obtainable under business-as-usual and improved cultivation practices. The results indicated that 40. 2 % additional yield over average yield (achieved by the farmers under study) of 1089 kg/ha can be obtained without major change in energy use pattern under business-as-usual cultivation practice. With the use of improved cultivation practices, a yield of 2274 kg/ha can be obtained through investment of 8118 MJ/ha. Adoption of the improved cultivation practice would improve energy productivity to 0. 30 kg/MJ as compared to 0. 179 kg/MJ presently achieved by the farmers.

40|$|In the Bolivian Altiplano, the {{yields of}} rainfed quinoa are {{relatively}} low and highly unstable. We use a validated crop water productivity model {{to examine the}} potential of closing quinoa yield gaps in this region. We simulate the expectable yields under <b>rainfed</b> <b>cultivation</b> and under different deficit irrigation (DI) strategies using the AquaCrop model for the Northern, Central and Southern Bolivian Altiplano. Simulated DI scenarios include a reference strategy avoiding stomatal closure during all sensitive growth stages and allowing drought stress during the tolerant growth stages (DI 0) and various restrictive deficit irrigation strategies (DIi) representing cases when water resources are limited. We obtain a logistic crop water production function for quinoa by plotting the seasonal actual evapotranspiration versus total grain yield. Due to the large scatter, this function only indicatively provides expectable yields. From the scenario analysis, we derive yield probability curves for the 3 agro-climatic regions. DI, without restriction in irrigation water during the drought sensitive growth stages, is able to close the yield gaps in the Northern, Central and Southern Bolivian Altiplano, and would guarantee a high and stable level of water productivity (WP). The yields of quinoa under <b>rainfed</b> <b>cultivation</b> during dry years are only 1. 1, 0. 5 and 0. 2 Mgha- 1 in the Northern, Central and Southern Bolivian Altiplano, whereas under DI 0 they are 2. 2, 1. 6 and 1. 5 Mgha- 1, respectively. Under limited water availability for irrigation, these stable yield levels decrease, most drastically in the Southern Bolivian Altiplano. Below a minimum water availability of 600 m 3 per ha and 700 m 3 per ha in the Central and Southern Bolivian Altiplano, respectively, the application of DI for quinoa is not significantly effective and should be avoided to save valuable resources. The yield probability curves we derive can serve as input for stochastic economic analysis of DI of quinoa in the Bolivian Altiplano.

40|$|This world {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} diversity of environments, and farming systems {{have evolved to}} fit into many of them. <b>Rainfed</b> <b>farming</b> systems are found in areas {{as diverse as the}} Sahelian zone of west and central Africa; eastern and southern Africa; west and central Asia; Afghanistan and Pakistan; central India; western China; semi-arid Australia; northern Mexico; and the prairies and central plains of USA and Canada. This chapter discusses ways of classifying <b>rainfed</b> <b>farming</b> systems for comparative, predictive and management purposes, and to assist in change from one type of system to another. Here, four categories of <b>rainfed</b> <b>farming</b> systems are distinguished: high-latitude rainfed systems with cold winters; mid-latitude rainfed systems with mild winters; subtropical and tropical <b>rainfed</b> highland <b>farm</b> systems; and semi-arid tropical and subtropical farming systems. Within these categories, systems are subdivided into two archetypes, based on low or high levels of productivity and farming intensity. Factors that influence the intensity and productivity of <b>rainfed</b> <b>farming</b> systems include the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration, water availability, drought risk, temperature regimes, soil quality, external input use, marketing margins, market access, tenure security, policy environment, and the purpose of crop–livestock integration. There are many interrelationships among these factors. For example, drought risk and water availability are affected by water harvesting practices, risk management practices, soil characteristics, and rainfall patterns and other climate variables. Soil characteristics are influenced by organic and inorganic fertiliser management and enterprise selection (including crop selection and crop–livestock integration). These are affected by input and product prices which in their turn are influenced by marketing margins and market access. Finally, all systems are affected by the quality of market infrastructure, and policies and institutional arrangements. Larry Harrington and Phil Tow[URL]...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Many {{researchers}} {{studied and}} emphasized on determining {{the importance of}} climatic factors that affect crop yield. As the most source of moisture in <b>rainfed</b> <b>cultivation,</b> precipitation {{is the most important}} climate factor. Spatial and temporal change of this factor effects crop yield. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is useful to characterize the condition of the moisture supply before and during the growing season of crops. Studies have shown that in some areas there is little correlation between spring wheat yield and SPI, while in other areas there is significant relationship between wheat yield and SPI. This difference indicates SPI as an indicator of moisture supply, depend on the study area. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the most effective period of precipitation during growing season for rainfed barley using variables obtained from moisture supply and precipitation periods in Tabriz. The most effective period of precipitation can be used for the management of <b>rainfed</b> <b>cultivation.</b> Materials and Methods: Daily temperature and precipitation data of Tabriz station were collected from Iran Meteorological Organization for the years 1955 to 2013. In addition, barley yields data were collected for the years 1977 to 2013. In this study, the occurrence of phenological stages (germination, tillering, anthesis, ripening and harvesting) were estimated using growing degree days (GDD). The SPI value for 28 -week time scale of the first week after planting (SPI 28) was considered as an indicator of the moisture supply during growing season. SPI 28 values less than zero and greater than zero representing different classes of drought and humidity respectively. For correlation analysis, 128 weekly variables were defined at different time scales of daily precipitation data (Table 2). The relationship between the crop yield and precipitation variables were analyzed by linear correlation. Results and Discussion: The correlation coefficient (r) between precipitation and annual rainfed barley yield were presented in Table 2. The highest correlation between yield and precipitation occurred during the 10 -week period between 25 February and 6 May, which was mostly observed at the end of April to mid-May that was coincide with the beginning of anthesis. So it can be concluded that the anthesis stage was the most critical stage to water stress in barley. Based on the SPI 28 value greater than zero (wet conditions) or less than zero (dry conditions), the amount of precipitation (between 25 February and 6 May) was divided into two groups. The amount of precipitation between 25 February and 6 May explained 78...|$|R

This high crop yield variability characterizes <b>rainfed</b> <b>farming</b> system in Ethiopia in general and in the central Rift valley (CRV) in particular (Seleshi and Demaree 1995; Conway and Hulme 1993).

The distinction between coping and adaptation strategies is mainly in terms of time scale. Coping strategies are short-term and unplanned in response to unexpected crop failure and yield losses and just for survival, while adaptation strategies are long-term and planned responding to expected and continued decline or uncertainty in future crop productivity and food production (Smit and Wandel 2006; Vogel 1998; Osbahr et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of Ethiopia’s economy, contributing more than 40 % to GDP and providing a livelihood to about 80 % of the population. Agriculture is dominated by smallholders growing predominantly rainfed cereals, making economic performance dependent on rainfall availability. This study used the stochastic frontier production function to analyse the productivity and technical efficiency of 4 different agricultural production systems in Ethiopia; namely, irrigated seasonal farms on traditional irrigation systems, irrigated seasonal farms on modern communal irrigation systems, <b>rainfed</b> seasonal <b>farms</b> for farmers {{who have access to}} irrigation and <b>rainfed</b> seasonal <b>farms</b> for farmers who {{do not have access to}} irrigation. Simple random samples of farmers were selected from lists of farmers. The sample of farmers constituted 122 from the traditional irrigated sites, 281 from the modern communal irrigated sites and 350 from the control rainfed sites of farmers without access to irrigation. For those farmers, from both traditional and modern communal irrigation, who also had access to <b>rainfed</b> <b>farms,</b> their <b>rainfed</b> <b>farms</b> were included in the sample of rainfed with access to irrigation. This sample constituted 434 farmers. The marginal productivity of land on modern communal irrigation systems shows that this is the smallholder irrigation option that should be developed by the Government of Ethiopia. However, the marginal productivity of land in the ‘rainfed without access to irrigation’ category is higher than that of the traditional irrigated system. Thus additional developed land should be put under ‘rainfed without access to irrigation’ before it is put under traditional irrigation; otherwise it should be developed into modern communal irrigation. The average technical efficiency for the modern irrigated system was estimated to be about 71 %, whereas this was estimated to be 78 % for the ‘rainfed without access to irrigation’ system. There are potential gains to be realised in improving efficiency in these two systems...|$|R

First, the paper undertakes a critical synthesis of the literature to assess three primary ways to enhance rainfed cereal yields: increasing effective rainfall use through improved water management, particularly water harvesting; increasing crop yields in rainfed areas through agricultural research; and reforming policies and increasing investments in rainfed areas. Second, the IMPACT-WATER integrated water-food modeling framework is applied to assess the current situation and plausible future options of irrigation water supply and food security, primarily on a global scale. This model simulates the relationships among water availability and demand, food supply and demand, international food prices, and trade at regional and global levels. The results show that rainfed agriculture will maintain {{an important role in}} the growth of food production in the future, although appropriate investments and policy reforms will be required to enhance the contribution of rainfed agriculture.
