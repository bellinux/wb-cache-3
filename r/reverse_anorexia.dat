40|$|Anabolic {{androgenic}} steroid (AAS) use {{is rapidly}} becoming a contemporary {{public health problem}} for many western countries. The British Medical Association Board of Science and Education (2002) revealed prevalence in UK fitness centres to be around 13 %, whereas in dedicated bodybuilding gyms the prevalence rate peaks at almost one half of all members. This growth in AAS usage {{is supported by a}} 2000 % increase in needle exchange attendance from 1991 - 2006 (Hoare & Flatley, 2008). Dandoy and Greige (2012) have shown that 3. 30 % of 9 th- 12 th grade students in the US reported having used AAS in the past. Investigations in Canadian, Brazilian, South African and Swedish populations also confirm a cross cultural prevalence rate of between 1 - 3 % (Adlaf & Smart, 1992; Galduroz, Noto, Nappo, & Carlini, 2005; Lambert, Titlestad, & Schwellnus, 1998; Kindlundh, Isacson, Berglund, & Nyberg, 1999, respectively). The most accurate estimate for prevalence within the UK general population has identified 293, 000 people having used AAS in their lifetime, with 73, 000 people having used in the past year (Crime Survey for England & Wales, 2015). The use of these misunderstood substances has added depth when the mental and physical side effects are considered. For example, Angell et al. (2012) explains case study evidence of a link between AAS use and cardio vascular disease (e. g. myocardial infarction), which is highly supported by Pope et al. (2013) with the addition of psychiatric and endocrine disorders. Also, Baggish et al. (2010) emphasised the risk of heart failure in long term users to be more severe than previously thought. The increasing use of anabolic steroids combined with a perception of limited risk in users (see Kimergård & McVeigh, 2014) therefore presents a public health issue in a state of severe incline. With the above in mind, the current study aimed to explore the reasons young males initiated AAS use and also their motives towards continued use. Two distinct theories have been {{associated with the use of}} AAS, the conduct problem explanation which associated use solely with adolescent anti-social behaviour and risk-taking behaviours, and the muscle dysmorphia interpretation which argues AAS use as representing distorted body image. Miller, Barnes, Sabo, Melnick, and Farrell (2002) rejected the argument for AAS being a mere drive for the male athletic ideal, as its usage had a strong relationship with other high risk behaviours (e. g. multiple drug use or suicide attempt). The authors argued that AAS use represents a pattern of risk taking behaviours, rather than an independent problem. Further, Nilsson, Baigi, Marklund, and Fridlund (2001) provided strong evidence for patterned, multiple drug use, which excluded cannabis and tobacco (Dodge & Hoagland, 2011). Kanayama, Hudson, and Pope (2010) introduced biological evidence for this association, explaining that both human and animal research indicates both AAS and other illicit drugs involve similar brain structures and mechanisms. Adopting a similar theoretical position to Miller, Barnes, Sabo, Melnick, and Farrell (2002), Wichstrøm and Pederson (2001) proposed that AAS use reflects only an alternative form of problem behaviour with only a secondary association with sport. Thiblin and Pärlklo (2002) strengthen this argument with the discovery that AAS use prospectively increased the risk of an antisocial lifestyle, whereas Kanayama, Pope, Cohane, and Hudson (2003) add that illicit drug use almost always precedes AAS use. In a review of recent findings Harmer (2010) highlight a wealth of recent evidence promoting the idea that AAS use rather than being focussed on muscularity and/or athletic endeavours, is part of a broader syndrome of problem behaviour, expanding that efforts to reduce rates of usage should focus on the general adolescent population as opposed to athletes. The literature and media dominant explanation for AAS use adopts the position that individuals use such substances as a result of psychological anxiety which stems from an underlying body image disorder. This explanation is the product of studies revealing AAS users to be substantially less confident and satisfied with their body image than non-users, which is further fuelled by bodybuilding (Kananyama et al., 2003; Olivardia, Pope, Borowiecki, & Cohane, 2004; Blouin & Goldfield, 1995). Pope, Gruber, Choi, Olivardia, and Phillips (1997) categorised the symptomatic expression of such feelings with the term muscle dysmorphia (MD) whereby people become pre-occupied by their degree of muscularity, and <b>reverse</b> <b>anorexia</b> (RA) which is characterised by a feeling of inadequate and reduced muscularity as muscularity actually increases significantly (Pope, Katz, & Hudson, 1993). In support of this causal explanation, Kanayama et al. (2003) highlighted that users differed significantly from non-users on symptoms of MD, whilst Kanayama, Barry, Hudson, and Pope (2006) posited that body image pathology is prominent in men with long term AAS use. Interestingly, Pope, Kanayama, and Hudson (2012) discovered that whilst many attributes showed little association to AAS use, intense body image concerns and conduct problems showed strong associations. The current body of evidence on the subject of AAS use promotes a highly disjointed understanding as to why it occurs so abundantly. There have been key evidence-based explanations which are, at a superficial level at least, linked to its use however the causal direction of each remains contested. Further to this, they are approached by a majority of researchers as separate entities with a narrow, rejecting viewpoint on the interaction of each. The purpose of the current study is to delineate both the potential precursors of AAS use and to highlight the contributions of different factors pertinent to its continued and prolonged usage...|$|E

40|$|Loss {{of muscle}} mass related to {{anti-cancer}} therapy {{is a major}} concern in cancer patients, being associated with important clinical endpoints including survival, treatment toxicity and patient-related outcomes. We investigated effects of voluntary exercise during cisplatin treatment on body weight, food intake as well as muscle mass, strength and signalling. Mice were treated weekly with 4 mg/kg cisplatin or saline for 6 weeks, and randomized to voluntary wheel running or not. Cisplatin treatment induced loss of body weight (29. 8 %, P < 0. 001), lean body mass (20. 6 %, P = 0. 001), as well as anorexia, impaired muscle strength (22. 5 % decrease, P < 0. 001) and decreased glucose tolerance. In addition, cisplatin impaired Akt-signalling, induced genes related to protein degradation and inflammation, and reduced muscle glycogen content. Voluntary wheel running during treatment attenuated body weight loss by 50 % (P < 0. 001), maintained lean body mass (P < 0. 001) and muscle strength (P < 0. 001), <b>reversed</b> <b>anorexia</b> and impairments in Akt and protein degradation signalling. Cisplatin-induced muscular inflammation was not prevented by voluntary wheel running, nor was glucose tolerance improved. Exercise training may preserve muscle mass in cancer patients receiving cisplatin treatment, potentially improving physical capacity, quality of life and overall survival...|$|R
50|$|Muscle dysmorphia {{was first}} {{conceptualized}} {{as a health}} risk in the late 1990s. Initially, the symptom profile {{was considered to be}} a <b>reverse</b> form of <b>anorexia</b> nervosa. Instead of a person desiring to be small and thin, he or she desires to be large and muscular. Later research, however, indicated that the subjective experience of muscle dysmorphia was more closely related to that of body dysmorphic disorder. This is still subject to debate.|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of cancer}} anorexia is multifactorial and associated with disturbances {{of the central}} physiological mechanisms controlling food intake. However, the neurochemical mechanisms responsible for cancer-induced anorexia are unclear. Here we show that chronic infusion of 5 -amino- 4 imida-zolecarboxamide-riboside into the third cerebral ventricle and a chronic peripheral injection of 2 deoxy-D-glucose promotes hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, increases food intake, and prolongs the survival of anorexic tumor-bearing (TB) rats. In parallel, the pharmacological activation of hypothalamic AMPK in TB animals markedly reduced the hypothalamic production of inducible nitric oxide synthase, IL- 1 beta, and TNF-alpha and modulated the expression of proopiomelanocortin, a hypothalamic neuropeptide that {{is involved in the}} control of energy homeostasis. Furthermore, the daily oral and intracerebroventricular treatment with biguanide antidiabetic drug metformin also induced AMPK phosphorylation in the central nervous system and increased food intake and life span in anorexic TB rats. Collectively, {{the findings of this study}} suggest that hypothalamic AMPK activation <b>reverses</b> cancer <b>anorexia</b> by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory molecules and controlling the neuropeptide expression in the hypothalamus, reflecting in a prolonged life span in TB rats. Thus, our data indicate that hypothalamic AMPK activation presents an attractive opportunity for the treatment of cancer-induced anorexia...|$|R
40|$|Interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) induces {{anorexia}} via {{direct action}} in the brain, and its participation in the pathogenesis of cancer-associated anorexia has been hypothesized. Because the functional ablation of the ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus (VMH), where IL- 1 receptors have been detected, <b>reverses</b> cancer-associated <b>anorexia</b> in tumor-bearing (TB) rats, we hypothesize that cancer anorexia involves the direct effect of IL- 1 on the VMH. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether the intra-VMH injection of the IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 (Ra)) improves food intake in anorectic TB rats. Sixteen Fischer rats (similar to 300 g/BW) were injected s. c. with 10 (6) trypan-blue viable methylcholanthrene sarcoma cells, and then individually caged. Chow and water were freely available, and food intake was recorded throughout the study. Normal food intake was measured in 8 more rats, injected s. c. with normal saline. Tumor developed in all rats. When TB rats became anorectic, they {{were randomly assigned to}} either treatment or control groups. Using stereotaxic techniques, 25 ng of IL- 1 (ra) dissolved in normal saline (TB-IL- 1 (r) a; n = 8), or an equal volume of normal saline (TB-NS; n = 8) was injected bilaterally into the VMH. After surgery, rats were Caged and changes in food intake recorded. At study's end, rats were sacrificed and brains removed for histological confirmation of injection sites. In the TB-NS group, food intake decreased with the occurrence of anorexia. In contrast, the intra-VMH injection of lL- 1 (r) a, reduced the severity of cancer anorexia, significantly improving food intake in TB-IL- 1 (ra) rats. Data indicate that centrally acting IL- 1 plays {{a significant role in the}} development of cancer anorexia...|$|R
