5|$|By 1953, the {{lighthouse}} was in poor {{condition and the}} U.S. Coast Guard opted to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> skeleton tower. The lighthouse was sold to the Fairfield Dock Company, which initially planned to move it ashore, but it was later decided to dismantle and scrap it. A plan existed to move {{the lighthouse}} ashore to a city park as a monument to Connecticut's maritime heritage, but the location could not be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{cast and}} production changes over the years, Last of the Summer Wine {{continued to be}} popular with viewers and was renewed year after year despite reports to the contrary. Rumours circulated {{as early as the}} 1980s that the BBC wanted to end the show and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new programme aimed at a younger audience. Its popularity made this decision hard to justify, however, since even repeats sometimes received ratings of as many as five million viewers per episode.|$|E

Along with the grass, a heating and drainage system was also installed at a cost of $3.5million to MLSE.|$|E
5|$|The first {{structure}} {{in what is}} now Sheerness was a fort built by order of Henry VIII to prevent enemy ships from entering the River Medway and attacking the naval dockyard at Chatham. In 1666 work began to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stronger fort. However, before its completion, this second fort was destroyed during the 1667 Dutch raid on the Medway. The Secretary of the Admiralty, Samuel Pepys, subsequently ordered the construction of Sheerness Dockyard as an extension to that at Chatham.|$|E
5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> simpler system.|$|E
5|$|Cal Poly Pomona's {{dominant}} landmark is a futurist-styled administrative facility {{known as}} the CLA Building which was designed by Antoine Predock and opened in 1993. The building’s peculiar shape (standing out by a triangular-shaped “skyroom” atop its eight-story tower) {{has become a symbol}} of the university; in addition, its close location to film studios based in the Hollywood borough of Los Angeles have prompted its inclusion in motion pictures such as Gattaca and Impostor. In 2013, the California State University Board of Trustees voted to demolish the building and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new academic/faculty complex because of severe seismic risks.|$|E
5|$|Charles I was a {{connoisseur}} of art, and paid {{greater attention to}} the aesthetic aspects of Windsor Castle than his predecessors. Charles had the castle completely surveyed by a team including Inigo Jones in 1629, but little of the recommended work was carried out. Nonetheless, Charles employed Nicholas Stone to improve the chapel gallery in the Mannerist style and to construct a gateway in the North Terrace. Christian van Vianen, a noted Dutch goldsmith, was employed to produce a baroque gold service for the St George's Chapel altar. In {{the final years of}} peace, Charles demolished the fountain in the Upper Ward, intending to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> classical statue.|$|E

For example, if the word STRETTa is on the board (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> blank A), the player may pick up the blank and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> actual A. However, he cannot <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> E, I, or O to produce STRETTE, STRETTI, or STRETTO.|$|R
5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more sympathetic court.|$|E
5|$|Due to the April 2007 Nor'easter, the Rainbow Lake Bridge in Pittsgrove Township {{was washed}} {{out and the}} New Jersey Department of Transportation had to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new bridge. This closure led to detours for traffic {{traveling}} between Vineland and Bridgeton. The new Rainbow Lake Bridge was opened in November 2007. The bridge spanning the Maurice River, which connects Vineland and Pittsgrove Township, was closed in July 2007 for planned repairs. This bridge replacement, which was completed in December 2007, cost $5 million and provided a wider and higher crossing of the river.|$|E
5|$|Hearst first {{bought the}} monastery {{intending}} {{to replace the}} family retreat at Wyntoon, {{on the bank of}} the McCloud River near Mount Shasta in remote Northern California. The original building was his mother's Bernard Maybeck-designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929. Hearst wanted to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> great stone building fitted with towers and turrets—an eccentric castle folly that was to be larger than its predecessor. To prepare for the arrival of the Spanish stones, Morgan drew up plans with the monastery's chapter house serving as the castle's entrance hall, and the large church enclosing a swimming pool. Other stones were designated as cladding for walls and rooms on the ground floor.|$|E

5|$|Originally planned as a new-build route across South London, {{construction}} of {{the first section of}} the South Circular near Eltham began in 1921 to a high-quality specification. The remainder of the road was supposed to be of a similar standard but it was repeatedly delayed, and the current route was allocated in the late 1930s to existing urban streets instead. Despite several proposals to either upgrade the road or <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> parallel motorway, there has been little change in the century since the route was first planned and most of the road is still urban streets. The South Circular has received sustained criticism for congestion and pollution {{and is one of the}} least popular roads in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Owsley studied law under John Boyle. After briefly {{serving in}} the state legislature, he was {{appointed}} by Governor Charles Scott to serve alongside Boyle on the Kentucky Court of Appeals. During his service on the court, Owsley {{was involved in the}} Old Court-New Court controversy. In 1824, the state legislature, unhappy with the court's rulings against debt relief legislation, attempted to abolish the court and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new court. For a time, both courts operated simultaneously, and both claimed to be the court of last resort in the state. Supporters of the old court won control of the legislature and abolished the new court in 1826. Owsley resigned from the Court of Appeals two years later.|$|E
5|$|Sharp's {{role in the}} Relief Party's plan {{to abolish}} the old court and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new, more {{favorable}} court is not known. As he was the administration's chief legal counsel, historians believe he was closely involved. He {{is known to have}} issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed to turn over his records to New Court clerk Francis P. Blair. By practicing as state attorney general before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court, Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy.|$|E

5|$|The Grey Cup {{has been}} stolen on two occasions: it {{disappeared}} {{for three days}} in 1967 when it {{was taken from the}} Hamilton Tiger-Cats as a prank, and in December 1969 it was stolen from the offices of the Ottawa Rough Riders at Lansdowne Park. The thieves attempted to ransom the trophy, but the CFL refused to pay and made plans to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> duplicate. An anonymous phone call led to the trophy's recovery two months later in a locker at Toronto's Royal York Hotel. The thieves were never found.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office, Marshall pursued an {{abbreviated}} campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley {{by a margin of}} 3 votes. The primary issue of the day was the Old Court – New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support for the Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district. His actions in the session, however, appear to have been unremarkable, and he did not seek reelection {{at the end of his}} term.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Rowan was {{appointed}} to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, serving until his resignation 1821. He was again elected to the state legislature in 1823. With the state reeling from the Panic of 1819, Rowan became the leader of a group of legislators dedicated to enacting laws favorable to the state's large debtor class. He believed {{the will of the people}} was sovereign and roundly denounced the Court of Appeals for striking down debt relief legislation as unconstitutional. He led the effort to impeach the offending justices, and when that effort failed, spearheaded a movement to abolish the court entirely and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new one, touching off the Old Court – New Court controversy. New Court partisans in the legislature elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate in 1824. During his term, the nascent Whig Party ascended to power in the state legislature, and at the expiration of his term in 1831, the Whigs replaced him with party founder Henry Clay.|$|E
