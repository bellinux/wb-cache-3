40|$|Several tufa {{complexes}} {{are known}} in the Slovak Karst which is a typical karst area of a temperate climate. This area is built of Mesozoic carbonates, mainly Triassic in age. The karst systems drain carbonate plateaux and lead water to <b>resurgences</b> located in valleys which are up to 300 m deep. Below the <b>resurgences</b> there are Holocene fossil tufa deposits that exceed 12 m in thickness. The tufas include stromatolite, moss, phytoclastic, oncoidal, and intraclastic facies. Extensive barrages which once dammed {{the upper reaches of}} the streams were formed in narrow valleys. They are composed predominantly of moss facies and stromatolites, with subordinate oncoidal and phytoclastic facies. Phytoclastic, oncoidal and intraclastic facies are dominant in dammed segments of streams, and include gastropod shells and charcoal fragments. Some small moss cushions are also developed. Barrages and dammed areas formed in a longitudinal fluvial depositional system. Conversely, below <b>resurgences</b> located on plateau slopes tufas of a perched springline depositional system were formed. These comprise deposits of prograding cascades constructed by moss, phytoclastic and stromatolitic facies. Presently, the tufas analysed are inactive. They stopped growing in the Late Holocene time, after which there was abrupt incision of the streams. This caused downcutting into Holocene tufas, in some places reaching Mesozoic bedrock. At present tufa is being precipitated from streams in all the sites studied...|$|R

40|$|Background The malaria burden has {{decreased}} significantly {{in recent years}} in Africa through the widespread use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and long-lasting insectici-detreated nets (LLINs). However, the occurrence of malaria <b>resurgences,</b> the loss of immunity of exposed populations constitute among other factors, serious concerns about the future of malaria elimination efforts. This study investigated the evolution of malaria morbidity in Dielmo (Senegal) before and after the implementation of LLINs. Methods A longitudinal study was carried out in Dielmo over eight years, from July 2007 to July 2015. In July 2008, LLINs were offered to all villagers, and in July 2011 and August 2014 the LLINs were renewed. A survey on LLINs use was done each quarter of the year. Thick smears stained with Giemsa, a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were performed for all cases of fever to assess malaria clinical attacks. Malaria cases were treated with ACT since June 2006. Results Malaria morbidity {{has decreased}} significantly since the implementation of LLINs in Dielmo, together with ACT. However, malaria <b>resurgences</b> have occurred twice during the seven years of LLINs use. These <b>resurgences</b> occurred the first time during the third year after the introduction of LLINs (aIRR (adjusted incidence-rate ratio) [95 % CI] = 5. 90 [3. 53; 9. 88] p< 0. 001) and a second time during the third year after the renewal of LLINs (aIRR [95 % CI] = 5. 60 [3. 34; 9. 39] p< 0. 001). Sixty-nine percent (69 %) of the nets tested for their long-lasting insecticidal activity remained effective after 3 years of use. Conclusion Good management of malaria cases by the use of ACT as first-line treatment against malaria in addition to the use of LLINshas significantly reduced malaria in Dielmo and allowed to reach the phase of pre-elimination of the disease. However, the occurrence of malaria <b>resurgences</b> raised serious concerns about malaria elimination, which would require additional tools in this village...|$|R
