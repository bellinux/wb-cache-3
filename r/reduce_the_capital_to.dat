Decisions involved in optimizing the expected revenues from the supplier's and the retailer's perspectives are analyzed.

30|$|Fiscal {{conditions}} are controlled for {{by means of}} the general government budget balance. The expectation is that, in the case of reforms that are costly to the budget, a larger fiscal space favours reforms. The spread with respect to Germany of real interest rates on 10 year government bonds is also included as a measure of markets’ perception of fiscal conditions 11. The expected effect of such a variable is not obvious. On the one hand, higher spreads may signal stronger market pressure to reform. On the other hand, they are associated with a reduced fiscal space to accommodate reforms with an impact on the budget. Another hypothesis that has often been put to the test is that fiscal consolidation makes reforms less likely by <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> political <b>capital</b> available <b>to</b> governments. We have not pursued that route as, in our sample, fiscal consolidation measures raise a strong suspicion of endogeneity, especially with reform measures with an impact on the budget, but also with those reforms that were triggered during the crisis in a context of capital flight, revenue losses linked to deep recessions, and bond market tensions, where governments had to respond simultaneously by tightening the budget and stepping up the reform agenda.|$|R

The objectives of this study were to assess farmers⿿ perceptions about implementation approaches of soil and water conservation (SWC) practices and to explore the relationship between the different dimensions (factors) of social capital and investments in LM practices. Simple descriptive statistics were applied to analyse the implementation approaches, while factor analysis was used <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> social <b>capital</b> variables <b>to</b> six non-correlated factors for subsequent analysis. The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) model was used to analyse the effects of social capital dimensions on investment in three LM practices: bunds, compost and fertilizer.

But farmers also pointed out several shortcomings of the mass mobilization approach (e. g., inefficient in labour utilization, lack of benefit sharing mechanism). The OLS model shows that the different dimensions of social capital affect investments in the LM practices differently. In particular, cooperation and trustworthiness positively influence investments in bunds and fertilizer use, while the extent of participation in formal institutions has a positive effect on fertilizer use and compost. Understanding and making use of these relationships could help in designing and implementing LM policies, strategies and programmes...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{theoretical}} arguments tell us {{that countries}} with relatively little capital benefit from financial integration as foreign capital flows in and speeds up the process of convergence. We show in calibrated exercises that conventionally measured welfare gains from this type of convergence appear relatively limited for the typical emerging country. The traditional theory, then, {{does not seem to}} provide a sufficient rationale for capital account liberalization. Our approach emphasizes instead that poor countries face a number of distortions that prevent the allocation of production inputs to their most efficient uses. Liberalization of <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> account should then be understood as a means to eliminate or reduce these distortions, and it is this effect of liberalization that may create first order gains. As an illustration of this approach, we present a model in which capital account account liberalization improves domestic allocative efficiency because of its effect on property rights. Our theory has implications for the political economy of financial integration. First, we show that politicians may open <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> account as a way of "locking-in" domestic reform, even when they cannot commit to either decision. Second, traditional trade arguments (e. g. Stolper-Samuelson) would argue that in capital-scarce countries, domestic capitalists would oppose financial integration as it <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> return <b>to</b> <b>capital,</b> while workers would typically favor it. The political economy of financial integration does not seem to reflect these predictions. Often, domestic capitalists favor integration while workers may or may not oppose it...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{interdependence}} between international asset pricing {{had become an}} important topic in modern finance literature.

It is argued that trade linkages {{is one of the}} factors that increase the linkages of stock market movement between countries. This study employs cointegration and causality techniques in investigating the relationship between Malaysian and its major trading partners stock market before and after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The results of the bivariate cointegration test on countries� stock indices indicate the existence of a long run relationship between Malaysian and the Philippines stock markets as well as between Malaysian and the United States stock markets for period before the financial crisis. Before the 1997 financial crisis, the daily price movement of Malaysian stock market is found to lead the daily price movement in Indonesia, China in the short-run, and the Philippines in the long run. In addition, there is a bi-directional relationship between Malaysia and the stock markets in Hong Kong and Thailand. The short-run causal relationship between the Malaysian stock market and the stock markets of its major trading partners started to weaken after the financial crisis. Such finding is highly attributable to the fact that Malaysia�s imposition of capital control in September 1998 in their attempt to curb speculative attacks had been relatively successful in shutting out foreign influences...|$|R

In this thesis, we research active portfolio optimisation techniques with heuristic algorithms to manage new regulatory challenges faced in risk management. We first study if heuristic algorithms can support risk management to find global optimal solutions <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> regulatory <b>capital</b> requirements. In a benchmark comparison of variance, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) objective functions combined with different optimisation routines, we show that the Threshold Accepting (TA) heuristic algorithm <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> requirements compared with the Trust-Region (TR) local search algorithm. Secondly, we introduce a new risk management approach based on the Unconditional Coverage test to optimally manage <b>the</b> regulatory <b>capital</b> requirements, while avoiding to over- or underestimate the portfolio risk.

More specifically, empirical and analytical VaR and CVaR estimation is compared with a simulation-based approach using a multivariate GARCH process.
