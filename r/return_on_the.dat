On March 23, Candice underwent successful surgery on her re-broken clavicle.|$|E

Soon after, she entered into an {{on-screen}} relationship with Dolph Ziggler, despite her being a fan favorite and him being a villainous character. At Night of Champions, Maria accompanied Ziggler to his match with Rey Mysterio for Intercontinental Championship. In the following weeks, Melina implied that Ziggler was cheating on Maria, which Maria did not believe.

5|$|Matheos, Moore and Portnoy {{recorded}} the album at Carriage House Studios in Stamford, Connecticut from June 2 to June 9, 2002. Songs {{with a strong}} progressive metal influence were mostly written by Matheos, while Moore had greater influence over the vocal-driven tracks. Portnoy made minor arrangement suggestions but did not {{take part in the}} actual writing of the album. The album's recording sessions were the first time Moore and Portnoy collaborated since 1994 in their work in Dream Theater. In 2009, Portnoy recalled that he found the experience of making the record difficult, and that he was frustrated by the lack of collaboration between him and Moore. Differences between Moore and Portnoy led to his <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> follow-up album as a session drummer rather than full-time member.|$|E
5|$|Melina {{made her}} <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> August 2, 2010 episode of Raw, attacking WWE Divas Champion Alicia Fox after a six-woman tag team match in which she, Jillian Hall, and Tamina {{defeated}} Eve Torres, Gail Kim, and Natalya.

Later that evening, she {{was defeated by}} Naomi in a singles match. After multiple confrontations between the two, Natalya would defeat Paige on the October 5 episode of Raw. Three days later, on Smackdown, Natalya teamed with Charlotte and Becky Lynch and the three defeated Team Bella (Alicia Fox, Brie Bella, and Nikki Bella). On the October 15 episode of Smackdown, while Paige saved Charlotte and Becky from an attack by Team Bella, Natalya, after a backstage altercation with Paige, would be attacked. In the end of October, Natalya started a feud with Team B.A.D. (Naomi, Tamina and Sasha Banks), after the three distracted her during her match with Paige, and attacked her, but Natalya went on to gain revenge over the team by defeating Naomi and Tamina in two singles matches before the feud quietly ended.|$|E

The following week Hardy saved his brother when CM Punk and The Hart Dynasty attacked both Jeff and John Morrison, turning into a fan favorite again. On the August 21 episode of SmackDown, after apologizing for his past actions towards Jeff and admitting {{that he was not}} behind any of Jeff's accidents, he had his first match back after his injury when he teamed with Jeff and John Morrison to defeat The Hart Dynasty and CM Punk, when Matt pinned Punk.|$|E
5|$|In a frigid driving rain at College Park, NC State {{brought an}} {{inspired}} effort {{in an attempt}} to break a three-game losing streak. In the first series of the game, the Wolfpack used 14plays and 8minutes to drive 73yards and score first. Maryland immediately responded with a drive that ended with a 13-yard Turner pass to Dan Gronkowski. In the following series, NC State again scored a touchdown, and Maryland kicked a field goal in response. NC State running back Andre Brown fumbled on the first play, and Maryland recovered on the Wolfpack 24-yard line. The Terrapins capitalized on the turnover with a Davin Meggett run into the endzone. After a Wolfpack field goal, the score was even at halftime, 17–17. In the third quarter, Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott rushed 24yards for a touchdown. Late in the quarter, Danny Oquendo fumbled a punt <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 50-yard line and the Wolfpack recovered.

The remaining Spanish cavalry, led by Ottavio Gonzaga, covered the rear.

5|$|James made a {{surprise}} return to TNA {{as a fan}} favorite, {{after a year and}} a half absence from the company, on January 30, 2015, during the tapings of Impact Wrestling in Glasgow, Scotland. James would then have several confrontations with Bram over his actions towards her real life fiancé, Magnus. On the April 24 episode of Impact Wrestling, James retired from wrestling to focus on becoming a full-time mother, but James Storm talked her into having one more match. On the June 3 episode of Impact Wrestling, James declined an offer by Storm to join The Revolution, which resulted in him intentionally shoving her onto a train track in the storyline, which sparked controversy. This was done to write off James from television, as she had no more dates set with the company at the time. James made her <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> July 1 episode of Impact Wrestling, confronting Storm and challenging him to a mixed tag team match. On the July 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, James and Magnus defeated Storm and his partner Serena, when James pinned Serena.|$|E
5|$|On August 4, 2006, WWE {{announced}} that Hardy had re-signed with the company. In the following weeks, vignettes aired hyping his <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> August 21 episode of Raw. On {{the day of}} his return, Hardy received a push and defeated then-WWE Champion Edge by disqualification when Lita pulled Edge out of the ring. After failing to capture the Intercontinental Championship from Johnny Nitro over the next few weeks, including at Unforgiven, Hardy finally defeated Nitro to win his second Intercontinental Championship on the October 2 episode of Raw. On the November 6 episode of Raw, Hardy lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Nitro, after Nitro hit him with the Intercontinental Championship title belt. One week later, Hardy regained it on the November 13 episode of Raw, with a crucifix pin. This marked Hardy's third reign as Intercontinental Champion.|$|E

40|$|Exchange traded funds (ETFs) {{are a new}} {{variety of}} mutual fund that first became {{available}} in 1993. ETFs have grown rapidly and now hold nearly $ 80 billion in assets. ETFs are sometimes described as more 'tax efficient' than traditional equity mutual funds, since in recent years, some large ETFs have made smaller distributions of realized and taxable capital gains than most mutual funds. This paper provides {{an introduction to the}} operation of exchange traded funds. It also compares the pre-tax and post-tax <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> largest ETF, the SPDR trust that invests in the S&P 500, with <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> largest equity index fund, the Vanguard Index 500. The results suggest that between 1994 and 2000, the before- and after-tax <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> SPDR trust and this mutual fund were very similar. Both the after-tax and <b>the</b> pre-tax <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fund were slightly greater than those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ETF. These findings suggest that ETFs offer taxable investors a method of holding broad baskets of stocks that deliver returns comparable to those of low-cost index funds. ...|$|R
