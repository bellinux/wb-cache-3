The Delphi method via LimeSurvey® was utilized to identify competencies specific to AODA clinical supervision. A panel of six experts in RCT and AODA clinical supervision completed five <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> collection beginning with an open-ended question. Consensus and stability of responses were calculated following Rounds 2 - 5 <b>of</b> <b>data</b> collection. Panelist fatigue resulted in data collection being discontinued after Round 5, prior to a consensus or stability of responses being reached. A total of 115 competencies and 51 competency sub-items were administered in Round 5. Results suggested that a consensus was not reached on items as one panelist represented a minority view on many items during multiple <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> collection. This panelist discontinued responding during the fifth <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> collection. Rank analysis of items based upon mean response was inconclusive due to limited sample size and response options.

30|$|Some trial {{encoding}} algorithms were proposed. Their implementation {{is quite}} simple relative to some comparable encoders. performance comparisons with some well-known similar algorithms were conducted. The results show better or no worse performance: the symmetric cipher has a slight edge over some common block ciphers, the digital signature can run considerably faster than some common schemes, the hash and the bit compressor {{are near the}} same {{with some of the}} most common. To sum up the approaches: optional encryption of the IV at the outset, followed by 2 <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> randomization with 1 <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> scrambling sandwiched in between in the symmetric cipher, adaptation of Hill cipher by use of un-invertible matrices as part of the verification keys in the signature scheme, chaining of addition/XOR/multiplication, followed by bit permutation and ending with some AND’s in the hash. The bit compressor is slightly different from Huffman coding that uses an array rather than a binary tree as the data structure, with an advantage and a disadvantage. Compression may be enhanced through bytes concatenation and Rice coding. A non-cryptographic version of the hash is for burst error correction.|$|R

40|$|We propose an Energy-aware Maximal Leaf Nodes Data Gathering (EMLN-DG) {{algorithm}} for periodic {{data collection}} and transmission in wireless sensor networks. For each <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> gathering, an EMLN-DG tree spanning the entire sensor network is formed based on the residual energy level available at the nodes {{and the number of}} uncovered neighbors of a node during tree formation. Only nodes that have a relatively larger number of neighbors as well as a higher energy level are included as intermediate nodes in the EMLN-DG tree. By maximizing the number of leaf nodes in a DG tree and considering the energy level available at the nodes while forming the tree, we reduce energy consumption per round as well as balance the energy level across all the nodes in the network. This contributes to a significantly larger network lifetime, measured as the number <b>of</b> <b>rounds</b> before the first node failure due to exhaustion of battery charge. Performance comparison studies with the well-known data gathering algorithms such as LEACH and PEGASIS illustrate that EMLN-DG can help to sustain the network for a significantly larger number <b>of</b> <b>rounds</b> {{and at the same time}} incur a lower, or if not comparable, energy loss, delay and energy loss*delay per <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> gathering.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{two related}} data gathering problems for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs). The MLDA problem is concerned with maximizing the system lifetime T {{so that we can}} perform T <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> gathering with in–network aggregation, given the initial available energy of the sensors. The M 2 EDA problem is concerned with minimizing the maximum energy consumed by any one sensor when performing T <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> gathering with in–network aggregation, for a given T. We provide an effective algorithm for finding an everywhere sparse integral solution to the M 2 EDA problem which is within a factor of α = 1 + 4 n/T of the optimum, where n is the number of nodes. A solution is everywhere sparse if the number of communication links for any subset X of nodes is O(X), in our case at most 4 |X|. Since often T = ω(n), we obtain the first everywhere sparse, asymptotically optimal integral solutions to the M 2 EDA problem. Everywhere sparse solutions are desirable since then almost all sensors have small number of incident communication links and small overhead for maintaining state. We also show that the MLDA and M 2 EDA problems are essentially equivalent, {{in the sense that we}} can obtain an optimal fractional solution to an instance of the MLDA problem by scalin...|$|R
