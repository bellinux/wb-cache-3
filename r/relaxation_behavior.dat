40|$|Continuous Time Random Walks (CTRW) {{are widely}} used to coarse-grain the {{evolution}} of systems jumping from a metastable sub-set of their configuration space, or trap, to another via rare intermittent events. The multi-scaled behavior typical of complex dynamics is provided by a fat-tailed distribution of the waiting time between consecutive jumps. We first argue that CTRW are inadequate to describe macroscopic relaxation processes for three reasons: macroscopic variables are not self-averaging, memory effects require an all-knowing observer,and different mechanisms whereby the jumps affect macroscopic variables all produce identical long time <b>relaxation</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Hence, CTRW shed no light on the link between microscopic and macroscopic dynamics. We then highlight how a more recent approach, Record Dynamics (RD) provides a viable alternative, based on a very different set of physical ideas: while CTRW make use of a renewal process involving identical traps of infinite size, RD embodies a dynamical entrenchment into a hierarchy of traps which are finite in size and possess different degrees of meta-stability. We show in particular how RD produces the stretched exponential, power-law and logarithmic <b>relaxation</b> <b>behaviors</b> ubiquitous in complex dynamics, together with the sub-diffusive time dependence of the Mean Square Displacement characteristic of single particles moving in a complex environment.
