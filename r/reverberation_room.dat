40|$|This paper investigates by {{experiment}} {{the absorption}} characteristics of several materials {{associated with the}} proposed acoustics impedance method using the combination of sound pressure and particle velocity sensors in various sound fields. This method {{is based on the}} concept of "ensemble averaged" surface normal impedance that extends the usage of obtained values to various applications such as architectural acoustics and computational simulations. The measurement technique itself is an improvement of the method using two-microphone technique and diffused ambient noise. A series of measurement in different sound fields was conducted to expand the relevant applicability of in-situ measurement using pu-sensor. The first part of the experiment aimed to confirm the reproducibility of the measured values of the method. Here, comparative round robin measurements in four <b>reverberation</b> <b>rooms</b> were conducted.

Absorber modules which are only 250 mm thick are described and their operating principles are discussed. The modules are used as linings for test cells and wind tunnels to provide free-field conditions down to 50 Hz for 1 / 3 -octave band measurements. Their unprecedented acoustic effectiveness is demonstrated by fundamental investigations in well-conditioned test rooms and final verification {{in a number of}} rigorously silenced and anechoic facilities completed in the research and development centers of 5 different automobile manufacturers in Europe and the United States. Since the novel acoustic materials and modules also provide several advantages concerning spaciousness, cleanability and durability their practicability is demonstrated in a few typical examples of approximately 50 completed measuring environments...|$|R
5000|$|By the mid-1950s, Putnam {{was one of}} {{the most}} sought-after engineer-producers in the United States. Sam Phillips sent Elvis Presley's Mystery Train and I Forgot to Remember to Forget to Putnam in August, 1955 with the {{instructions:}} [...] "Give me 'hot' level on both 78 and 45's and as much presence peak and bass as possible!." [...] Universal Recording had become so successful that clients including Nelson Riddle, Mitch Miller and Quincy Jones began urging him to open a facility on the west coast. In 1957, he sold his interest in Universal Recording and with support from Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby, he established a new company called United Recording Corp. and moved to Hollywood, taking over and remodeling a defunct film studio at 6050 Sunset Boulevard. Putnam was determined to incorporate as many technological innovations into the new complex as possible and he constructed new facilities, including a significant modernization of studio control room concept to permit multi-track monitoring and recording, featuring Putnam's innovative Bonnet design to provide overhead forward speaker mounting and provide seating space for guests while improving the engineer's view of the studio. Until that time, control rooms were typically small booths. These new control rooms also housed new multi-channel custom consoles designed and manufactured in a second story loft area of the building (the birthplace of UREI). United's facilities included three acoustically isolated studios of varying sizes, three lacquer mastering studios (one stereo) and a stereo re-mixing room. In addition, each studio had its own stereo acoustic <b>reverberation</b> <b>room.</b> All facilities were cross connected electronically at a central location so that all facilities were available to each other as needed.|$|E

40|$|The sound {{reflectivity}} {{of noise}} barriers elements {{is one of}} the major acoustic product characteristics. Traditionally this property was tested in <b>reverberation</b> <b>rooms</b> according to EN 1793 - 1 and the results were used to predict the effect of sound reflections in the far field. As in many cases these results cannot be used directly to assess the far field influence of reflections, two methods to modify the test results (truncation and correction for finite sample size) may be used for practical applications. More recently outdoor in-situ sound reflectivity tests were developed as an alternative for the laboratory tests (CEN/TS 1793 - 5). After the first development phase in the EU project Adrienne (1995 - 1997) the in-situ test method for reflectivity was improved in the EU-FP 7 project QUIESST (2009 - 2012).

40|$|Transport through quantum and {{microwave}} cavities is studied by analytic and numerical techniques. In particular, {{we consider the}} statistics for a finite net probability current (Poynting vector) flowing through an open ballistic Sinai billiard to which two opposite leads/wave guides are attached. We show that if the net probability current is small, the scattering wave function inside the billiard is well approximated by a Gaussian random complex field. In this case, the current statistics are universal and obey simple analytic forms. For larger net currents, these forms still apply over several orders of magnitudes.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) This thesis {{explores the}} means of objectively {{measuring}} diffuse sound fields contained within music performance auditoria. Although the diffuse field {{is considered to be}} {{an important component of the}} reverberant sound field there is currently no widely accepted method for its measurement. A review of methods shows that attempts to characterize the field may be divided into those methods that seek to directly measure the state of the field and those that indirectly indicate the existence of the state. The primary focus of this thesis is the application of Ambisonic techniques to capture the spatial aspects of the sound field. Initial work explores the rotation of a directional microphone in three measurement spaces. The results and modeling in idealised simulated sound fields indicate that the method may have some efficacy. The method is extended through the application of signal processing to the output of an Ambisonic microphone array. The method is tested firstly in a <b>reverberation</b> <b>room</b> that is modified progressively to produce a series of room states with incrementally increasing reverberation time. The extents of the measurement system were tested by measuring the degrees of diffusivity reached in a <b>reverberation</b> <b>room.</b> Diffusing panels were progressively added in the expectation the increases in diffusivity would be detected. The measurement was carried out in conjunction with standard absorption coefficient measurements outlined in Appendix A of ISO 354. Comparison was made between the measured field and the standard method for achieving a diffuse field in a <b>reverberation</b> <b>room</b> test facility. The final stage attempts to find correlation between physical measures of diffuse fields and listener’s subjective assessment of those fields. To that end a paired comparison test was conducted where listeners were presented music samples rendered through simulated halls where the scattering coefficients and consequently the sound field diffusivity was varied.
