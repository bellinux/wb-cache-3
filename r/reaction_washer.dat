50|$|Since 2014 it is {{possible}} to torque tighten bolts without the use of a reaction arm, and thus without pinch point. This is a great break-through in the industry. Reaction arm free torqueing {{is possible}} due to the usage of a <b>reaction</b> <b>washer.</b> The knurled side of the washer hold on to the construction/flange and the bolt or nut turn over a smooth and through-hardened surface. The <b>reaction</b> <b>washer</b> will become a stationary object underneath the nut, eliminating the use of reaction arms.|$|E
