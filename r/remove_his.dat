His powers would often backfire if his doghouse was inadvertently removed by outside forces or accident, imperiling friend and foe alike.|$|R

5|$|Bregowine died in 764 and was {{originally}} {{buried in the}} baptistry in Canterbury, but his remains were moved to the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in 1123. This followed an attempt in around 1121 to <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> remains to another monastery, which came to nothing. The remains were placed by the altar of St Gregory in the south transept, after having been briefly placed in the north transept. Bregowine was later considered a saint, with a feast day of 26August, although Florence of Worcester, a 12th-century writer, recorded his death date as 24August. Other sources record the death date as 25August. His life was later written by Eadmer in the 12thcentury.|$|E
5|$|During the Postclassic period, {{the most}} common form of human {{sacrifice}} was heart extraction, influenced by the method used by the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the pyramid. Depending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet. The officiating priest would then <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> ritual attire and dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that symbolized the rebirth of life. Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 William Champion, and Lord Dysart, {{operators}} {{of the nearby}} Twickenham Ferry, took legal action against Hammerton to <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> right to operate the ferry. Although Hammerton won the initial case, the judgement was reversed on appeal. Following considerable public interest in the case, a public subscription raised the funds for Hammerton {{to take the case}} to the House of Lords, who ruled in his favour on 23 July 1915.|$|E

5|$|In the one-day tournament, Ambrose took 18 wickets at 13.38. He took eight wickets in the two-match final—both {{games were}} {{won by the}} West Indies. In the first final, he took five for 32, driven to bowl with more hostility when the Australian batsman Dean Jones asked him to <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> white {{wristbands}} while bowling. He followed up with three for 26 in the second match to be named player of the finals.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 2007, Chris Taylor, {{mounted on}} a {{pantomime}} horse, confronted police officers, who were on foot, and {{asked them if they}} needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel. He was later asked by police officers to <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> clothing for examination, since it resembled a police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid. The reference was to the horse flu outbreak, which forced police officers to face APEC protesters on foot. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, 1995 Tkach {{had surgery}} to <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> gall bladder. Shortly thereafter, he was readmitted to the {{hospital}} because of severe intestine and back pain. Surgeons then removed a grapefruit-size tumor from his intestines and discovered he had colon cancer. In a letter to ministers, dated September 6, Tkach {{announced that he was}} also diagnosed with bone cancer. He elected not to undertake radiation treatments. As Armstrong had done before him, Tkach named a successor to become pastor general in the event of his death. In that case, it was Tkach's son, Joseph Tkach Jr.|$|E

5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 9:00a.m. local time for a 30-minute warm-up session where several drivers ran into the track's run-off areas. Kanaan {{continued}} his good performance and recorded the fastest time with a lap of 59.869 seconds. Herta was second-fastest, and Fernández was third. Bräck and de Ferran rounded out the session's top five fastest drivers. Fernández locked his brakes {{and went into the}} turn five tire wall which stopped the session for three minutes to allow course officials to <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> car from the barrier, and Franchitti and Junqueira made contact at the pit lane entrance but both drivers continued without any apparent damage.|$|E
5|$|Welensky {{considered}} a federal unilateral {{declaration of independence}} when the new Northern Rhodesian constitution appeared likely to grant an African majority in its parliament. Determined at one point to prevent changes, Welensky was convinced that if he refused, the British would use military force to <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> government. Believing that preparations were being made for an invasion from Kenya, he discussed the federation's ability to repel an attack with his defence chiefs and plans were set in motion. In the end, {{the idea of a}} British invasion was one of many options considered, and did not make it past cabinet discussion.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from the Yukon, he assumed command of the A Division of the NWMP in Maple Creek (today in Saskatchewan). After two months at Maple Creek, {{he took over the}} NWMP Macleod Department (today in Alberta) as Superintendent, serving there until 1913. He became a prominent landowner during his time in Macleod, owning several lots in town, as well as a section outside. He was appointed a commissioner of police in the new province of Alberta in November 1911. In 1913, he was posted to the NWMP Headquarters in Regina to assist in the organization of the Criminal Investigation Branch. In August he was granted a leave of absence {{when he went to the}} Mayo Clinic at Rochester to undergo surgery to repair an undisclosed rupture and <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> appendix. After returning to Regina in 1914, he retired at the rank of Superintendent on April 5, 1915.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's statue {{at the end}} of Worcester High Street stands {{facing the}} cathedral, only yards from where his father's shop once stood. Another statue of the {{composer}} by Rose Garrard {{is at the top of}} Church Street in Malvern, overlooking the town and giving visitors an opportunity to stand next to the composer in the shadow of the Hills that he so often regarded. In September 2005, a third statue sculpted by Jemma Pearson was unveiled near Hereford Cathedral in honour of his many musical and other associations with the city. It depicts Elgar with his bicycle. From 1999 until early 2007, new Bank of England twenty pound notes featured a portrait of Elgar. The change to <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> image generated controversy, particularly because 2007 was the 150th anniversary of Elgar's birth. From 2007 the Elgar notes were phased out, ceasing to be legal tender on 30 June 2010.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E

5|$|In 1929–30, ill-health {{restricted}} Jackson to {{just five}} first-class matches and five innings for Balmain. Despite his health, Jackson {{had a successful}} season, and scored 168 not out against Arthur Gilligan's English team, which toured Australia briefly en route to New Zealand. He {{was seen as an}} automatic selection for the 1930 Ashes tour of England. He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial, an innings regarded by many as the best he had ever played. Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia, missing the next two state matches. His health problems continued after an operation to <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> tonsils; a procedure that was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered any problems with his tonsils. Bill Ponsford had suffered from tonsillitis during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences. Complications resulting from the operation saw Jackson lose a stone (6.4 kilograms) in weight.|$|E
5|$|In August 2002, Angel spent 24 hours {{shackled}} underwater {{in a phone}} booth-sized {{water torture}} cell near the WWE entertainment store in New York's Times Square, WWE corporation being {{the owners of the}} World Underground Theatre where Angel had been performing his stage show. To prepare for the trick, he practiced in a neighbor's backyard swimming pool next to his mother's house in East Meadow, New York. Prior to the performance he had only managed to spend 12 consecutive hours in the water. He fasted for 24 hours before the performance {{to make it through the}} period without need to exit and use the washroom. During the trick he went through 16 oxygen tanks. After the trick he was required to <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> own shackles and chains before exiting the water. Within an hour, his skin began to react substantially to the water.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, Žigić {{signed for}} Spanish club Racing Santander; his goals and his {{partnership}} with Pedro Munitis helped them achieve a mid-table finish in La Liga. He {{then moved to}} Valencia, {{but was unable to}} establish himself as a regular in the starting eleven. He spent {{the second half of the}} 2008–09 La Liga season back with Racing on loan, for whom he scored 13 goals in just 19 matches. Žigić joined Birmingham City of the Premier League in 2010, and in his first season, he scored in their League Cup win. Even after relegation to the Championship, and despite increasing efforts to <b>remove</b> <b>his</b> large salary from the financially struggling club's wage bill, he remained with Birmingham for the full four years of his contract. Having been without a club for a few months, he rejoined Birmingham for the second half of the 2014–15 season.|$|E
