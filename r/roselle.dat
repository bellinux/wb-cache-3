5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain if he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. <b>Roselle</b> was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and <b>Roselle</b> were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. <b>Roselle</b> returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Past this interchange, Route 28 becomes West Westfield Avenue {{and crosses}} into <b>Roselle</b> Park, where it {{continues}} through {{a mix of}} residences and commercial establishments, where it crosses over the Raritan Valley Line and intersects with County Route 617 (Faitoute Avenue/Gordon Street) before heading into the downtown area of <b>Roselle</b> Park. Here, the road comes to junctions with County Route 619 (Locust Street) and County Route 627 (Chestnut Street) before heading into residential areas. The route intersects County Route 616 (Linden Road), forming a brief concurrency with that route until the county route turns north onto Galloping Hill Road. At this point, Route 28 enters Elizabeth, where it continues through more urbanized residential areas before crossing Route 439 (Elmora Avenue). After the intersection with Route 439, the route continues past urban residences and business, narrowing into a two-lane undivided road at the intersection with County Route 618 (Magie Avenue). A short distance later, Route 28 ends at an intersection with the southbound direction of Route 27, which turns from Westfield Avenue to head south on Chilton Street.|$|E
5|$|Como died in {{his sleep}} on May 12, 2001, {{at his home in}} Jupiter Inlet Colony, Florida, six days before his 89th birthday. He was {{reported}} to have suffered from symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Como's older son, Ronnie, and his daughter, Terri, could not agree on their interpretations of Como's 1999 living will and it became a matter for the courts in the year before his death. His funeral Mass took place at St. Edward's Catholic Church in Palm Beach, Florida. Como and his wife, <b>Roselle</b> are buried at Riverside Memorial Park, Tequesta (Palm Beach County), Florida.|$|E

50|$|<b>Roselle's</b> {{tenure as}} President {{was marked by}} {{aggressive}} fund-raising campaigns {{and an increase in}} fiscal discipline. Through privatizing many services and other cost-cutting measures, he cut the university's annual budget by $32 million and eliminated the school's $8 million annual deficit. Under <b>Roselle's</b> leadership, the university's endowment more than tripled from $362 million when he took office in 1990 to over $1.4 billion in 2006.|$|R

5|$|Como {{suffered}} a debilitating fall from a stage platform in 1971 while taping Perry Como's Winter Show in Hollywood. X-rays showed no serious injury to his knee, {{but by the}} next morning, it was twice its normal size. The ailing Como chartered a jet {{back to his home}} and doctors in Florida, where a second exam showed it had been seriously broken. His knee was re-set and placed in a cast with a recuperation time of eight months. In 1993, he was successfully treated for bladder cancer. When <b>Roselle</b> died suddenly on August 12, 1998, at the age of 84, the couple had been married for 65 years. Como was reportedly devastated by her loss.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Como left Canonsburg, {{moving about}} 100 miles away to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where his uncle had a barber {{shop in the}} Hotel Conneaut. Around 80 miles from Cleveland, it was a popular stop on the {{itinerary}} for dance bands who worked {{up and down the}} Ohio Valley. Como, <b>Roselle,</b> and their friends had gone to nearby Cleveland; their good times took them to the Silver Slipper Ballroom where Freddy Carlone and his orchestra were playing. Carlone invited anyone who thought he might have talent to come up and sing with his band. Young Como was terrified, but his friends urged him and pushed him onto the stage. Carlone was so impressed with Como's performance that he immediately offered him a job.|$|E
5|$|Route 27 crosses into Rahway, Union County and intersects the {{northern}} terminus of Route 35. Route 27 continues north using four-lane St. Georges Avenue. The route passes through Rahway, passing by residences and businesses. In Rahway, the route sees about 25,022 cars a day. It continues northeast and crosses into Linden, where the route heads through a more commercial setting with businesses lining {{both sides of}} the road. At the intersection with County Route 617 (Wood Avenue), Route 27 forms the border of <b>Roselle</b> to the west and Linden to the east, with about 23,081 vehicles using the road on a daily basis. It passes by Warinaco Park and forms the border between Elizabeth to the west and Linden to the east before entirely entering Elizabeth at the Richford Terrace intersection.|$|E
50|$|Much of <b>Roselle's</b> time as President of the University of Kentucky {{was absorbed}} by a scandal that erupted in 1988 {{involving}} the men's basketball team.

The most serious allegations were that a basketball recruit, Eric Manuel, received help on the ACT college entrance exam and another recruit, Chris Mills, received $1,000 in cash from assistant coach Dwane Casey.|$|R
500|$|Como {{competed with}} Jackie Gleason {{in what was}} billed as the [...] "Battle of the Giants" [...] and won. This is now rarely mentioned, in part because Como {{commonly}} downplayed his own achievements, and also because {{the two men were}} friends. The weekly ratings winner would phone the loser for some mock gloating. At the height of this television competition, Como asked Gleason a favor: to visit his home when his mother-in-law, a big Gleason fan, was there. Though Mrs. Belline spoke no English and Gleason no Italian, <b>Roselle's</b> mother was thrilled. Como's words to Gleason after the visit, [...] "Anything you want, you got it. In fact, I'll even do one of your shows so the ratings will be better." [...] Como was among those who filled in for Gleason on The Jackie Gleason Show in 1954 when the entertainer suffered a broken ankle and leg in an on-air fall.|$|R
40|$|Background: Rosella (Hibiscus sabdariffa) {{contains}} anthocyanins, niacin and fiber.

This study aimed to determine the effect of <b>roselleâ€™s</b> dried calyx infusion on serum HDL cholesterol. Methods: This Experimental research utilized with Pre and Post Test randomized controlled Group Design. The sample consisted of 24 Sprague-Dawley rats, 8 -week-old male which previously adapted for one week and then divided equally into four groups (randomly determined) : K (control), P 1 (treatment 1), P 2 (treatment 2), P 3 group (treatment 3).

5|$|The Comos' first child, Ronnie, {{was born}} in 1940 while the Weems band was working in Chicago. Como left the {{performance}} to be at his wife's side {{even though he was}} threatened with dismissal if he did so. Though Perry was now making $250 a week and travel expenses for the family were no problem, young Ronnie could not become used to a normal routine when they were able to stay in one place for a period of time. The radio program Beat the Band did not always originate from Chicago, but was often done from locations such as Milwaukee, Denver and St. Louis, as the band continued to play road engagements while part of the radio show cast. The Comos decided road life was no place to try raising a child, and <b>Roselle</b> and the baby went back to Canonsburg.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the Comos {{celebrated their}} silver wedding anniversary {{with a family}} trip to Italy. On the {{itinerary}} was an audience with Pope Pius XII. Como, who sat in a side wing of the Long Island church where he attended Sunday Mass {{in an effort to}} avoid attracting attention, was both puzzled and upset on returning home that photos from the visit made the newspapers throughout the world. A thorough check of both the Como and NBC publicity offices found that neither was responsible for the release of the photos to the media; it was done by the Vatican's press department. When Perry and <b>Roselle</b> became Knight Commander and Lady Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 1952, it was a news item only after Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, who had been honored at the same ceremony, mentioned it some time later.|$|E

500|$|Chandler {{endorsed}} {{dark horse}} candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson in the 1987 Democratic primary, and his endorsement was considered crucial to Wilkinson's {{victory in the}} race. After Wilkinson's election as governor, he restored Chandler's voting rights on the University of Kentucky's board of trustees. (In 1981, then-governor John Y. Brown, Jr. had designated Chandler an [...] "honorary", non-voting member of the board.) While discussing the University of Kentucky's decision to dispose of its investments in South Africa {{at a meeting of}} the university's board of trustees on April 5, 1988, Chandler remarked [...] "You know Zimbabwe's all nigger now. There aren't any whites." [...] The comment immediately drew calls for Chandler's resignation from the University Senate Council and the Student Government Association, and approximately 50 students marched on university president David <b>Roselle's</b> office demanding that Chandler apologize or resign. Commenting on the controversy the next day, Chandler said [...] "I was raised in a small town in Western Kentucky. There were 400 whites and 400 blacks, and we called them niggers and they didn't mind. And I reverted temporarily, at least, to that expression, and of course, I wish I hadn't." [...] That apology did not satisfy many, and 200 protesters marched on the state capitol, demanding that Governor Wilkinson remove Chandler from the board. Wilkinson refused to remove Chandler and urged the crowd to forgive him.|$|R

25|$|The {{history of}} the library {{dates back to the}} mid-1970s when then-University President Otis A.

King Library was completed, however, funding for the new library never materialized due to budget cuts from the state.|$|E
25|$|RCA quickly {{moved to}} expand its {{broadcasting}} activities. In the fall of 1921 it set up its first fulltme broadcasting station, WDY, at the <b>Roselle</b> Park, New Jersey company plant. By 1923 RCA was operating three stationsâ€”WJZ (now WABC) and WJY in New York City, and WRC (now WTEM) in Washington, D.C. A restriction imposed by AT's interpretation of the patent cross-licensing agreements required that the RCA stations remain commercial free, and they were financed by profits from radio equipment sales.|$|E

25|$|Originally Fort Touraille {{and planned}} as a battery, it was renamed {{after the death}} of Prince Albert in 1861, the fort was built on Braye bay eastern {{headland}} between 1856 and 1859 comprising 43 guns with barracks for 424. <b>Roselle</b> battery also on the headland with seven guns was completed in 1854. Around 1900 the fort was modified, reducing the number of guns and fitting two 6 inch BL guns, which changed the appearance of the fort. The fort was the island military headquarters housing a regular army garrison until 1929.|$|E

25|$|The New Jersey {{portion of}} freeway was planned in 1955 as the Union Freeway and {{designated}} as I-278 in 1958. It was {{to connect the}} Goethals Bridge west to I-78 at the tripoint of Springfield, Union Township, and Millburn. The western part of this planned freeway faced strong opposition. Even though it was to run along an abandoned railroad right-of-way, it would traverse through dense development in <b>Roselle</b> Park, Kenilworth, and Union Township, thereby making the project further disliked. By 1967, state officials decided not to pursue the continuation of I-278, and used the funds for I-278 to build I-195 across Central New Jersey instead. The only section of I-278 in New Jersey was built between US1/9 in Linden and the Goethals Bridge, opening to traffic in 1969 {{at a cost of}} $11.5 million.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, the 17-year-old Como met <b>Roselle</b> Belline at {{a picnic}} on Chartiers Creek that {{attracted}} many young people from the Canonsburg area. Como, who attended the cookout with another girl, did not spot <b>Roselle</b> until everyone was around the campfire singing and the gathering was coming to a close. When it came Como's turn to sing, he chose [...] "More Than You Know", with his eyes on <b>Roselle</b> for the entire song. The teenage sweethearts were married July 31, 1933. They raised three children, Ronnie, David, and Terri, with traditional, non-show-business values. Because Perry Como believed his professional life and his personal life should be kept separate, he declined repeated interview requests from Edward R. Murrow's Person to Person.|$|E
500|$|Some {{happiness}} for Dr. Julian, however, was to {{come from}} this scandal. On December 24, 1935 he married Anna <b>Roselle</b> (Ph.D. in Sociology, 1937, University of Pennsylvania). They had two children: Percy Lavon Julian, Jr. (August 31, 1940 â€“ February 24, 2008), who became a noted civil rights lawyer in Madison, Wisconsin; and Faith <b>Roselle</b> Julian (1944â€“ [...] ), who still resides in their Oak Park home and often makes inspirational speeches about her father and his contributions to science.|$|E
500|$|A second {{ceremony}} marking Perry Como Day {{took place}} August 24, 1977, {{but the most}} ambitious project began in 1997 â€“ a statue of the singer. The planned statue had the blessing of Como's wife, <b>Roselle,</b> who died the year before it was unveiled on May 15, 1999. As part of the festivities, Como's stool and music stand from The Perry Como Show and the equipment he used at Steve Fragapane's barber shop were donated to the borough. Como was not present at the unveiling because of poor health. The inscription on the base, [...] "To This Place God Has Brought Me", was a favorite saying of Como's; the musical feature was added in 2002.|$|E
500|$|Around {{this same}} time, Julian also became {{entangled}} in an interpersonal conflict with his laboratory assistant, Robert Thompson. Julian had recommended Thompson for dismissal in March 1932. Thompson sued Julian for [...] "alienating the affections of his wife", Anna <b>Roselle</b> Thompson, stating {{he had seen}} them together in a sexual tryst. Julian counter-sued him for libel. When Thompson was fired, he too gave the paper intimate and personal letters which Julian had written to him from Vienna. Dr. Julian's letters revealed [...] "how he fooled the [...] president into accepting {{his plans for the}} chemistry building" [...] and [...] "how he bluffed his good friend into appointing" [...] a professor of Julian's liking. Through the summer of 1932, the Baltimore Afro-American published all of Julian's letters. Eventually, the scandal and accompanying pressure forced Julian to resign. He lost his position and everything he had worked for.|$|E
500|$|Canonsburg {{has always}} been very proud to be the birthplace of Perry Como; the local {{newspaper}} of the time, Canonsburg Daily Notes, {{seems to have been}} the first to write an article about him. Their edition of July 19, 1934, featured a photo and the following: [...] "A young Canonsburg boy threatens to snatch the crown from Bing Crosby's head. Perry Como, son of Mr. and Mrs. Pietro Como of 530 Franklin Ave. is said to have one of the grandest baritone voices in the country." [...] The borough honored him three times {{over the course of his}} life. The first of these events took place September 14, 1946, when Third Street, where Perry worked in the barber shop of Steve Fragapane, was renamed [...] "Perry Como Avenue". Perry, <b>Roselle,</b> and Como's mother, Lucy, attended the ceremonies and banquet held at the State Armory.|$|E
500|$|Of the 40 boroughs {{created in}} 1894 and 1895, 26 were in Bergen County. [...] The ones {{elsewhere}} included <b>Roselle</b> and Mountainside, in Union County. In September 1894, state Senator Henry D. Winton {{warned that the}} legislature at its next session was likely to amend if not gut the Borough Act because of the craze in Bergen County. Nine new members had {{been added to the}} Board of Chosen Freeholders from the previous sixteen, Winton noted, with a proportionate increase in the cost of government, which would be further inflated by the multiplicity of boroughs. The signal that the law might change did not slow the incorporations: Wood-Ridge, Carlstadt, Edgewater, Old Tappan and other boroughs trace their geneses to late 1894. There were some fistfights and hard feelings over the borough formations, and Russell Jones, whose house was on the newly drawn line between Teaneck and Bogota, saw it burn down as firefighters argued about who had jurisdiction.|$|E
