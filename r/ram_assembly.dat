5000|$|The D-500 is {{controlled}} by a PDP-8 computer which controls an electrical pump with a piston made of synthetic ruby to facilitate a very precise flow of hydraulic fluid to drive a mechanical <b>ram</b> <b>assembly</b> - this assembly has eight syringes, four on each side, each filled with a different pH liquid buffer. The buffer solutions were then washed across the sample holder and into another resin bead filled tube which had an inside diameter {{of the order of}} fifty micrometres (about the diameter of a human hair).|$|E
50|$|When {{the trigger}} is pulled, an {{electronic}} microswitch sends {{a signal to}} the marker's electronic board telling it to begin the firing sequence. The board then actuates the solenoid which is provided with air from the LPR. When the solenoid valve is actuated, air that normally holds the hammer in the full-back position is re-routed through the <b>ram</b> <b>assembly</b> and now drives the hammer forward at a rapid rate. The hammer then pins open the valve for a period of 6-16ms(this time is called the dwell). Since the marker's bolt is linked to the hammer, it travels forward at the same time carrying a paintball forward, passed the detents, into the firing position. Air travelling upwards through the, now open, valve is routed through the bolt and the paintball is shot out the barrel through a combination of air pressure and kinetic energy imparted from the bolt movement. Once the dwell time has passed, the solenoid returns the hammer (and thus the bolt) to the full-back position by routing the LPR-sourced air back through the default passage.|$|E
5000|$|To {{inspect the}} engine, {{it can be}} {{manually}} [...] "barred over" [...] with a lever, but manual engine rotation is slow and inefficient. In some applications manually barring the engine over can be difficult or impossible. The preferred tool for engine rotation is an electrically powered, hydraulically operated [...] "turning jack". The turning jack uses a hydraulic cylinder and <b>ram</b> <b>assembly</b> that automatically advances to engage {{a hole in the}} flywheel. When the ram reaches its limit, it automatically retracts and advances again to engage another hole. The engine is then progressively rotated through its cycle and can be rotated in either direction by installing the jack {{on either side of the}} engine. Not only is a turning jack faster and more efficient, it is also safer since there is no risk of a barring lever coming loose and causing injury or damage. Also, with a turning jack, there is no need for the mechanic to be in physical contact with the engine at any point during the inspection process.|$|E

50|$|The firing {{sequence}} is electronically controlled, and starts {{from the open}} bolt. At {{the pull of the}} trigger, an electronic impulse trips the four-way valve, pushing compressed gas through the ram from behind, forcing the <b>ram</b> and bolt <b>assembly</b> to move towards the valve, impacting the poppet and releasing gas to the chamber. The paintball is fired with this gas, then the four-way solenoid reverses, and delivers gas {{to the front of the}} ram, returning the <b>ram</b> and bolt <b>assembly</b> to their starting position.|$|R

It takes ~ 40% of this time to perform stage 1 (see SPAdes {{assembly}} approach above) when using three iterations (k=22, 34 and 56), and ~ 45%, 14% and 1% for completing stages 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{next-generation}} sequencing technologies is accompanied {{with the development}} of many whole-genome sequence assembly methods and software, especially for de novo fragment assembly. Due to the poor knowledge about the applicability and performance of these software tools, choosing a befitting assembler becomes a tough task. Here, we provide the information of adaptivity for each program, then above all, compare the performance of eight distinct tools against eight groups of simulated datasets from Solexa sequencing platform. Considering the computational time, maximum random access memory (<b>RAM)</b> occupancy, <b>assembly</b> accuracy and integrity, our study indicate that string-based assemblers, overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) assemblers are well-suited for very short reads and longer reads of small genomes respectively. For large datasets of more than hundred millions of short reads, De Bruijn graph-based assemblers would be more appropriate. In terms of software implementation, string-based assemblers are superior to graph-based ones, of which SOAPdenovo is complex for the creation of configuration file. Our comparison study will assist researchers in selecting a well-suited assembler and offer essential information for the improvement of existing assemblers or th...|$|R
50|$|After the {{formation}} of MNS, Shinde represented MNS in the general elections of 2009 from the Mumbai North East constituency but lost to Sanjay Dina Patil of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).The party also contested its first state assembly elections in 2009. Shinde contested from the Bhandup constituency of Mumbai and won. He defeated Shiwajirao Nalawade of Nationalist Congress Party and Sunil Raut of Shiv Sena. But before he could take the oath in the Assembly, Shinde was suspended from entering the premises of the Mumbai and Nagpur Assembly for four years for attacking MLA Abu Asim Azmi of Samajwadi Party. The suspension was later revoked in late 2009 and Shinde thus officially became the Member of Legislative <b>Assembly.</b> <b>Ram</b> Kadam, Ramesh Wanjale and Vasant Gite of MNS had also been suspended {{for the same reason}} and were reinstated along with Shinde.|$|R
40|$|Analyses of metagenomic {{datasets}} {{that are}} sequenced {{to a depth}} of billions or trillions of bases can uncover hundreds of microbial genomes, but naive assembly of these data is computationally intensive, requiring hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes of RAM. We present latent strain analysis (LSA), a scalable, de novo pre-assembly method that separates reads into biologically informed partitions and thereby enables assembly of individual genomes. LSA is implemented with a streaming calculation of unobserved variables that we call eigengenomes. Eigengenomes reflect covariance in the abundance of short, fixed-length sequences, or k-mers. As the abundance of each genome in a sample is reflected in the abundance of each k-mer in that genome, eigengenome analysis can be used to partition reads from different genomes. This partitioning can be done in fixed memory using tens of gigabytes of <b>RAM,</b> which makes <b>assembly</b> and downstream analyses of terabytes of data feasible on commodity hardware. Using LSA, we assemble partial and near-complete genomes of bacterial taxa present at relative abundances as low as 0. 00001 %. We also show that LSA is sensitive enough to separate reads from several strains of the same species. Rasmussen Family FoundationNational Human Genome Research Institute (U. S.)

50|$|The former Deputy Speaker of the Odisha <b>Assembly,</b> <b>Ram</b> Chandra Panda had {{approached}} the Odisha High Court seeking its intervention to expedite {{the process of}} river-linking in the State. He had filed a PIL citing River-linking {{the only way to}} save Ganjam. The petitioner also led the ‘Rushikulya Bachao Manch (RBM)’ which was demanding the linking of the Mahanadi and Rushikulya. This organisation had organised a large farmers’ rally on 2007 demanding the implementation of this river-linking project. It may be noted that the state government had also come up with a river linking project between Vansadhara and Rushikulya rivers a few years ago, which was shelved.According to him Mahanadi-Rushikulya river linking project {{is the only way to}} save water-scarce Ganjam district and to reduce regular floods in the Mahanadi. The RBM had also prepared a detailed viability report of the project.According to Mr Panda the viable solution to link the two rivers was to use the Subalaya barrage project to transfer surplus water of Mahanadi to Rushikulya. A memorandum to this effect had been submitted to the Centre by the State Government in 2000 and in 2003. Even the National Water Development Agency had acknowledged that the project was viable.|$|R
