40|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar observations provide a means for obtaining high-resolution digital topographic maps from measurements of amplitude and phase of two complex radar images. The phase of the radar echoes may only be measured modulo 2 pi; however, the whole phase at each point in the image is needed to obtain elevations. An approach to 'unwrapping' the 2 pi ambiguities in the two-dimensional data set is presented. It is found that noise and geometrical <b>radar</b> <b>layover</b> corrupt measurements locally, and these local errors can propagate to form global phase errors that affect the entire image. It is shown that the local errors, or residues, can be readily identified and avoided in the global phase estimation. A rectified digital topographic map derived from the unwrapped phase values is presented...|$|E
40|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful technique providing meter-precision elevation maps and millimeter-precision surface displacement maps. Since 2007, the high-resolution SAR satellite TerraSAR-X allows monitoring of even single buildings from space using advanced monostatic repeat-pass stacking techniques. Furthermore, the launch of its twin satellite TanDEM-X in 2010 facilitates bistatic single-pass SAR interferometry. The main objective of this mission is the generation of a global digital elevation model. It also provides a configurable SAR platform for demonstrating new interferometric techniques and applications. However, in dense urban areas, standard TanDEM-X elevation models are inaccurate because ambiguities in <b>radar</b> <b>layover</b> areas cannot be solved. This letter describes the potential of joint monostatic and bistatic (motion-free and atmosphere-free) SAR interferometric stacking for an improved scene elevation and surface deformation estimation in complex urban areas. It involves exploiting distributed scatterers (DSs) using an advanced high-resolution small-baseline subset algorithm. Since most of the scatterers within a radar image can be classified as DSs, there is an increasing focus on an optimal processing of DSs for urban area monitoring. The fusion technique and an application test case are presented using a high-resolution spotlight mixed TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X data stack of Las Vegas, USA...|$|E

In this paper, from real ENVISAT/ASAR multiple angle interferometric data, SRTM DEM with 90 m horizontal resolution and 1 : 50000 digital topographic DEM, the concrete impact of incidence angle on DEM accuracy has been analysed and discussed from qualitative and quantitative views 。 The result indicates: (1) For ASAR multi-incidence angle interferometric data, the effects of the layover and foreshortening on DEM precision are significantly at lower incidence angle, and difference of DEM accuracy is large, for example, the accuracy difference between IS 2 and IS 4 ASAR DEM is more than 6 m. So, the incidence angle must be selected rigidly when InSAR are used for rugged terrain mapping. (2) Temporal decorrelation is serious with 35 days time interval, the overall evaluation of DEM precision are difficult. If the InSAR data that have wider incidence range and have not temporal decorrelation can be obtained, the further and overall evaluation and analysis that <b>radar</b> <b>layover,</b> shadow and foreshortening are how to affect the DEM precision can be investigated...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission SRTM {{produced}} the first global {{digital elevation model}} (DEM) data set of the world’s topography in the year 2000. The data set covers regions between ± 60 degrees latitude with a resolution of 30 meters. The 90 % height accuracy in these regions is on the range of 6 meters, limited by the baseline length, the metrology and the instrument noise. In mountainous areas larger data gaps exist in the C-band data set produced by NASA/JPL {{as well as in}} the X-band data set produced at DLR. The reason for these gaps are high slopes that lead to <b>radar</b> shadow, <b>layover</b> and to phase unwrapping problems. In order to overcome these problems and to further increase the DEM accuracy, future systems must take advantage of multiple incidence angles, multiple heading angles and multiple baselines or multiple radar frequencies. The paper demonstrates high mountain artifacts in SRTM data and demonstrates strategies and algorithms to overcome them. Optimized acquisition strategies for future missions are proposed that are adapted to the slope distribution of the area. The TanDEM-X mission currently studied at DLR and the expected product accuracy is shortly presented. ...|$|R

Interpretation maps of surface drainage patterns, surface texture patterns and surface lineament patterns were made from the Seasat-A SAR images of southwestern Virginia, eastern Kentucky, and southwestern West Virginia. These maps are compared with similar data derived from Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) images of the same area. In regions of low topographic relief the Seasat-A SAR images are superior to the Landsat MSS images for drainage and lineament mapping. This is due to the higher image resolution of the Seasat radar imagery; also the inherent illumination geometry of the Seasat-A SAR provides better detection of subtle topographic features. In. areas of high topographic relief, the Seasat-A SAR images are distorted because of the <b>radar</b> <b>layover</b> effect, but still the Seasat-A SAR is as good as the Landsat MSS images for geologic interpretations.

The automatic matching of images taken with significant time interval is very difficult and not leading to satisfying results. In addition stereo pairs from IKONOS, QuickBird and the former OrbView- 3 are expensive. The stereo pairs from the SPOT HRS only have been available for test purposes, usually only the derived height models can be bought, but they may be critical in forest areas (Büyüksalih, Jacobsen 2008). As alternative solution the stereo sensors Cartosat- 1 and ALOS/PRISM are now available; both systems with 2. 5 m ground sampling distance (GSD). Cartosat- 1 stereo pairs have been used for automatic image matching, leading even in forest areas to good results. Of course by matching as well as with the SRTM C-band and X-band digital surface models (DSMs) are generated, representing the visible surface. In most cases digital elevation models (DEMs) are requested, showing the height of the bare ground. DSMs can be filtered to DEMs if enough points of the bare ground are available.

As of December 2016, the assessment reveals that, since May 2015, more than 250 interferometric wide (IW) swath products have been acquired on average every month by the constellation at regular revisit cycles for the entirety of Great Britain. A simulation of <b>radar</b> distortions (<b>layover,</b> foreshortening, and shadow) confirms that topographic constraints have a limited effect on SAR visibility of the landmass and, despite the predominance of rural land cover types, there is potential for over 22, 000, 000 intermittent small baseline subset (ISBAS) monitoring targets for each acquisition geometry (ascending and descending) using a set of IW image frames covering the entire landmass. Finally, InSAR results derived through ISBAS processing of the Doncaster area with an increasing amount of Sentinel- 1 IW scenes reveal a consistent decrease of standard deviation of InSAR velocities from 6 mm/year to ≤ 2 mm/year.

40|$|The {{utilisation}} of InSAR {{techniques for}} the monitoring of subsidence over mining areas, employing {{open pit and underground}} mining methods, {{has a large}} potential due to inaccessibility and safety issues associated with the usage of classical surveying techniques. InSAR can also be very competitive concerning the cost of provided results. However, there are a few issues that may significantly limit InSAR applicability for subsidence monitoring in mining areas. The highly dynamic character of subsidence induced by mining, especially employing caving as a mining system, may lead to ambiguity issues. This could happen when the vertical movement between the neighbouring cells (pixels) of the SAR image is greater than quarter of the wavelength of a radar signal over the period between image acquisitions. The altered terrain topography, involving steep slopes and deep pits, may also lead to <b>radar</b> signal <b>layover</b> issues for specific satellite and pit slope geometry. In this paper the authors analyse the above-mentioned issues and present how the InSAR technology was applied as a help to monitor large scale and highly dynamic subsidence for a real case study in Western Australia. It was recognised that the analysis of ground deformation dynamics, based on topographical surveys, may provide a basis for the resolution of ambiguity issues existing in InSAR processing. Also, the new technique involving generation of a detailed DEM based on the current topographical surveys and pixel-by-pixel analysis were applied in order to identify a precise extent of layover areas...|$|R

40|$|The area of Northern Bohemian {{coal basin}} {{is rich in}} brown coal. Part of it is undermined, but large areas were mined using open-pit mines. There are {{numerous}} reclaimed waste dumps here, with a horse racetrack, roads {{and in some cases}} also houses. However, on most of the waste dumps, there are forests, meadows and fields. Above the coal basin, there are the Ore mountains which are suspected to be sliding down to the open mines below them. We installed 11 corner reflectors in the area and monitor them using the TerraSAR-X satellite. One of the reflectors is situated in the area of <b>radar</b> <b>layover,</b> therefore it cannot be processed. We present preliminary results of monitoring the remaining corner reflectors, with the use of 7 TerraSAR-X scenes acquired between June and December 2011. We process whole scene crops, as well as the artificial reflector information alone. Our scene set contains interferometric pairs with perpendicular baselines reaching from 0 to 150 m. Such a configuration allows us to distinguish deformations from DEM errors, which are usual when the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM (X-band) is used for Stripmap data. Unfortunately, most of the area of interest is decorrelated due to vegetation that covers both the Ore mountains and the reclaimed waste dumps. We had to enlarge the scene crop {{in order to be able}} to distinguish deformations from the atmospheric delay. We are still not certain about the stability of some regions. For the installed artificial reflectors, the expected deformations are in the order of mm/year. Generally, deformations in the area of interest may reach up to about 5 cm/year for the Ervěnice corridor (a road and railway built on a waste dump). When processing artificial corner reflector information alone, we check triangular sums and perform the processing for all possible point combinations – and that allows us to correct for some unwrapping errors.

40|$|Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a {{satellite}} {{remote sensing technique}} that provides information about the topography and deformation of the Earth’s surface. In recent years, InSAR’s capabilities have been considerably improved with the launch of high resolution SAR satellites such as TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X and COSMO-SkyMed. Mapping of urban areas and even single buildings is now facilitated via multitemporal InSAR techniques, for instance, Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and SAR Tomography (TomoSAR). These methods exploit long-time coherent scatterers, e. g. the so-called Persistent Scatterers (PSs), and provide elevation and surface displacement measurements with a high precision. However, the density of PSs is low in non-urban areas and {{it is imperative to}} increase the spatial density of measured points. Here, high-resolution SAR sensors offer new opportunities. For this purpose, in addition to the PSs, partially coherent Distributed Scatterers (DSs) can be exploited. Various methods such as the Small Baseline Subset Algorithm (SBAS) and SqueeSAR have been proposed to extract information from DSs. However, SBAS is prone to phase unwrapping errors in rural areas and estimates deformation at only low resolution. The alternative technique SqueeSAR can be computationally expensive as it processes all possible interferogram combinations. Accordingly, this thesis addresses the development of advanced stacking techniques in high resolution SAR interferometry, with a focus on complex areas that are difficult to process using conventional techniques. To this end, first, a new method has been developed for deformation monitoring of DSs at object resolution in non-urban areas. It applies adaptive spatial filtering to improve the differential interferometric phase, followed by deformation estimation using an L 1 -norm based SBAS approach that is more robust to phase unwrapping errors. Second, an alternative approach for mean deformation velocity mapping of DSs has been proposed for highly decorrelated areas, wherein, wrapped interferograms (with small baselines) are directly used and the deformation velocity is mapped at a suitable object resolution. It includes identification of homogenous patches, estimation of deformation velocity gradients for these patches and then, model-based deformation integration to obtain spatially dense deformation velocity estimates. Lastly, a fusion of TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X data stacks has been presented for complex urban area monitoring exploiting both PSs and DSs. TerraSAR-X allows monostatic acquisitions and in conjunction with the TanDEM-X satellite, bistatic acquisitions are now also possible. Thus, stacks of monostatic repeat-pass and bistatic single-pass interferograms are available. The bistatic interferograms are of high quality and are free from deformation, atmosphere and temporal decorrelation. By properly integrating the data stacks, an improved estimation of topography and deformation is possible. However, the independent processing and subsequent simple combination of the bistatic and monostatic data is not beneficial. Standard TanDEM-X Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are inaccurate in dense metropolitan areas because of phase unwrapping errors. These errors occur due to height discontinuities and geometrical limitations such as <b>radar</b> <b>layover.</b> Therefore, the joint processing of TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X data has been investigated. The developed techniques have been demonstrated using TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X data from various test sites and a high performance has been proven. The results show an improved utilization of the information hidden in the data and an extension of the applicability of existing techniques for mapping displacement and topography in difficult test areas. The proposed methods can benefit from future SAR systems with even higher resolution...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The spatial {{resolution}} of state-of-the-art {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) sensors enables the structure analysis of urban areas. The appearance of buildings in magnitude images in settlements is dominated by effects of the inherent oblique scene illumination, such as <b>layover,</b> <b>radar</b> shadow and salient lines of bright scattering caused by direct reflection or multipath signal propagation. For example, in urban residential districts often salient pairs of parallel lines of bright magnitude are caused by gable-roofed buildings. The first line (closer to sensor) is due to direct reflection of planar roof parts of small or even zero incidence angle. The second line {{can be related to}} signal caused by a dihedral corner reflector built between ground and building wall. In this paper an approach is presented aiming at reconstruction of gable-roofed buildings by knowledge based analysis considering the mentioned SAR-specific effects. The estimation of building height is carried out by the extracted geometric parameters from the amplitude image. The resulting geometric model ambiguity can be solved by comparing simulated and real interferometric phases at the building location.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{differential}} radar interferometry (D- InSAR) {{has proven to}} be a powerful remote sensing technique to detect and measure deformation of the Earth’s crust, such as landslides, with an accuracy of a few millimeters. However, as a consequence of the inclined imaging geometry, areas with a topographic relief (where landslides usually occur) appear heavily distorted in the radar image. Thereby slopes inclined towards the radar appear shortened (foreshortening) and in extreme even can cause an overlapping of different <b>radar</b> signals (<b>layover</b> effect); slopes oriented away from the radar seem stretched (elongation) or even can be shadowed by a steep mountain (shadowing). These effects limit or even prohibit the use of a radar image for interferometric applications. Besides these geometric distortions, the land cover has great influence on the applicability of differential radar interferometry. For example vegetation-free areas such as buildings, roads and rocks show a high stability in their backscattering properties, whereas areas covered by vegetation, especially forests, have varying backscattering properties at different times (e. g. due to wind). Areas with a high constancy of their backscattering properties are better suited for the D-InSAR-technique. To date prior to an investigation using D-InSAR these limiting effects usually are only estimated, sometimes leading to disappointing results when the actual radar images are analyzed. Therefore in the present work a GIS routine was developed, which based on freely available DEM data (SRTM) not only accurately predicts the areas in which layover and shadowing will occur, but also determines the measurable percentage of the movement (portion oriented in radar line of sight) for a given radar acquisition geometry. Additionally land cover classification data (CORINE) is used to assess the influence of the land cover to D-InSAR deformation measurements. Thus by using this new GIS application, in future it is possible to evaluate the usability of D-InSAR landslide deformation measurements in a certain region quite accurately before the expensive actual radar records are ordered...|$|R
40|$|The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission {{flown in}} the year 2000 was the first {{approach}} to generate a global DEM from interferometric SAR. The C-band and X-band data acquired in 11 days have been processed with great success at NASA/JPL and at the German Aerospace Center DLR, respectively. Both data sets however show problems that should {{be taken care of}} in the design of future InSAR DEM missions: -	phase unwrapping turned out to be unreliable in rugged mountain areas with very steep slopes -	<b>radar</b> shadow and <b>layover</b> rendered significant areas in rugged mountain unusable -	the vertical accuracy was limited by the signal to noise ratio (SNR), by the baseline length and by the baseline knowledge The SNR is expensive to improve and future missions like, e. g. the TanDEM-X mission currently studied at DLR, tend to use larger baselines therefore. This, however, will further complicate phase unwrapping. The key to improve phase unwrapping stability while simultaneously increasing height accuracy is a multi channel InSAR system. Multiple channels can be achieved by different frequencies, delta-k processing, multiple simultaneous baselines or multiple observations with different baselines.

40|$|Flood extents {{caused by}} fluvial floods in {{urban and rural}} areas may be {{predicted}} by hydraulic models. Assimilation may be used to correct the model state and improve the estimates of the model parameters or external forcing. One common observation assimilated is the water level at various points along the modelled reach. Distributed water levels may be estimated indirectly along the flood extents in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images by intersecting the extents with the floodplain topography. It is necessary to select a subset of levels for assimilation because adjacent levels along the flood extent will be strongly correlated. A method for selecting such a subset automatically and in near real-time is described, which would allow the SAR water levels to be used in a forecasting model. The method first selects candidate waterline points in flooded rural areas having low slope. The waterline levels and positions are corrected for the effects of double reflections between the water surface and emergent vegetation at the flood edge. Waterline points are also selected in flooded urban areas away from <b>radar</b> shadow and <b>layover</b> caused by buildings, with levels similar to those in adjacent rural areas. The resulting points are thinned to reduce spatial autocorrelation using a top-down clustering approach. The method was developed using a TerraSAR-X image from a particular case study involving urban and rural flooding. The waterline points extracted proved to be spatially uncorrelated, with levels reasonably similar to those determined manually from aerial photographs, and in good agreement with those of nearby gauges. ...|$|R
40|$|Orthorectification of {{satellite}} data {{is one of}} the most important pre-processing steps for application oriented evaluations and for image data input into Geographic Information Systems. Although highand very high-resolution optical data can be rectified without ground control points (GCPs) using an underlying digital elevation model (DEM) to positional root mean square errors (RMSEs) between 3 m and several hundred meters (depending on the satellite), there is still need for ground control with higher precision to reach lower RMSE values for the orthoimages. The very high geometric accuracy of geocoded data of the TerraSAR-X satellite has been shown in several investigations. This is due to the fact that the SAR antenna measures distances which are mainly dependent on the terrain height and the position of the satellite. The latter can be measured with high precision, whereas the satellite attitude need not be known exactly. If the used DEM is of high accuracy, the resulting geocoded SAR data are very precise in their geolocation. This precision can be exploited to improve the orientation knowledge and thereby the geometric accuracy of the rectified optical satellite data. The challenge is to match two kinds of image data, which exhibit very different geometric and radiometric properties. Simple correlation techniques do not work and the goal is to develop a robust method which works even for urban areas, including <b>radar</b> shadows, <b>layover</b> and foreshortening effects. First the optical data have to be rectified with the available interior and exterior orientation data or using rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). From this approximation, the technique used is the measurement of small identical areas in the optical and radar images by automatic image matching, using a newly developed adapted mutual information procedure followed by an estimation of correction terms for the exterior orientation or the RPC coefficients. The matching areas are selected randomly from a regular grid covering the whole imagery. By adjustment calculations, parameters from falsely matched areas can be eliminated and optimal improvement parameters are found. The original optical data are orthorectified again using the delivered metadata together with these corrections and the available DEM. As proof of method the orthorectified data from IKONOS and ALOS-PRISM sensors are compared with conventional ground control information from high-precision orthoimage maps of the German Cartographic Survey. The results show that this method is robust, even for urban areas. Although the resulting RMSE values are in the order of 2 – 6 m, the advantage is that this result can be reached even for optical sensors which do not exhibit low RMSE values without using manual GCP measurements...|$|R
40|$|Because of its {{independence}} of {{time of day}} and its all weather capability, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has become a key remote sensing technique in the last decades. In the past, spatial resolution of space borne SAR systems was rather coarse, so the exploitation of building signature and even the reconstruction of buildings in dense urban areas based on InSAR data was restricted to commercial and modern experimental airborne SAR systems. These are capable of providing single pass InSAR data with spatial resolution well below half a meter and much better. Now, {{the new generation of}} space borne SAR satellites (e. g. TerraSAR-X, RADARSAT- 2, or COSMO-SkyMed) allows a more detailed analysis at the object level even for urban areas. This gives rise to the question: Is it possible to transfer basic algorithms of building reconstruction based on airborne sensors to such data? Because of the high availability and short repeat time of the space borne sensors, they are particularly useful e. g. in case of disaster management. In this paper a known algorithm of gable-roofed building reconstruction is applied to airborne and space borne InSAR data of the same test site. The algorithm exploits the appearance of buildings in magnitude images, which is dominated by effects of the inherent oblique scene illumination, such as <b>layover,</b> <b>radar</b> shadow and salient lines of bright scattering caused by direct reflection or multipath signal propagation.

40|$|Flooding is a {{major hazard}} in both rural and urban areas worldwide, {{but it is in}} urban areas that the impacts are most severe. An {{investigation}} of the ability of high resolution TerraSAR-X data to detect flooded regions in urban areas is described. An important application for this would be the calibration and validation of the flood extent predicted by an urban flood inundation model. To date, research on such models has been hampered by lack of suitable distributed validation data. The study uses a 3 m resolution TerraSAR-X image of a 1 -in- 150 year flood near Tewkesbury, UK, in 2007, for which contemporaneous aerial photography exists for validation. The DLR SETES SAR simulator was used in conjunction with airborne LiDAR data to estimate regions of the TerraSAR-X image in which water would not be visible due to <b>radar</b> shadow or <b>layover</b> caused by buildings and taller vegetation, and these regions were masked out in the flood detection process. A semi-automatic algorithm for the detection of floodwater was developed, based on a hybrid approach. Flooding in rural areas adjacent to the urban areas was detected using an active contour model (snake) region-growing algorithm seeded using the un-flooded river channel network, which was applied to the TerraSAR-X image fused with the LiDAR DTM to ensure the smooth variation of heights along the reach. A simpler region-growing approach was used in the urban areas, which was initialized using knowledge of the flood waterline in the rural areas. Seed pixels having low backscatter were identified in the urban areas using supervised classification based on training areas for water taken from the rural flood, and non-water taken from the higher urban areas. Seed pixels were required to have heights less than a spatially-varying height threshold determined from nearby rural waterline heights. Seed pixels were clustered into urban flood regions based on their close proximity, rather than requiring that all pixels in the region should have low backscatter. This approach was taken because it appeared that urban water backscatter values were corrupted in some pixels, perhaps due to contributions from side-lobes of strong reflectors nearby. The TerraSAR-X urban flood extent was validated using the flood extent visible in the aerial photos. It turned out that 76...|$|R
