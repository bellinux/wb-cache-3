Approximately 1-3 treatments may be needed to completely remove a mole.

500|$|The NTSB {{determined}} that {{the damage to the}} left wing engine pylon had occurred during an earlier engine change at the American Airlines aircraft maintenance facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on March 29 and 30, 1979. On that date the aircraft had undergone routine service, during which the engine and pylon had been removed from the wing for inspection and maintenance. [...] The <b>removal</b> <b>procedure</b> recommended by McDonnell-Douglas called for the engine to be detached from the pylon before detaching the pylon itself from the wing. [...] However, American Airlines, as well as Continental Airlines and United Airlines, had developed a different procedure that saved approximately 200 man-hours per aircraft and [...] "more importantly from a safety standpoint, it would reduce the number of disconnects (of systems such as hydraulic and fuel lines, electrical cables, and wiring) from 72 to 27." [...] This new procedure involved removal of the engine and pylon assembly as a single unit, rather than as individual components. United Airline's implementation involved use of an overhead hoist to support the engine/pylon assembly during removal and installation. [...] The method chosen by American and Continental procedure supported the engine/pylon assembly with a large forklift.|$|E

[...] Eve secretly attempts to kill Alexandra {{several times during}} their childhood. Kate decides to name Eve heir to Kruger-Brent but disinherits her when she discovers Eve's true nature. Eve meets George Mellis, who like her has been disinherited by his rich family, and they plot to have George marry Alexandra and kill her, leaving George with Alexandra's fortune while Kate will have {{no option but to}} take Eve back to run the company. Eve manages to help George marry Alexandra, but she taunts him to the point that he nearly beats her to death. A talented surgeon, Keith Webster, fixes her face, and Kate reconciles with Eve and plans to put her back in her will. Eve decides she no longer needs George and decides to get rid of him. [...] She intercepts Alexandra and prevents her rendezvous with George. [...] Eve then pretends to be Alexandra and kills him. The police find his body and build a case against Eve. Keith realizes the truth when Dr. John Harley, the family's doctor whom Eve visited under the guise of a suicidal Alexandra, says he was able to tell the twins apart because of Eve's facial scar from her assault though Keith knows he left no scars on Eve's face and has a post surgical photo to prove it. Keith threatens to show the photo to the police if Eve doesn't marry him, and although she complies she cheats on him openly with a younger man. Keith refuses to testify at the coroner's inquest and Kate gives Eve an alibi, believing Eve murdered George but thinking she will punish Eve in her own way. Before she can do so, Keith deliberately destroys Eve's face during a laugh line <b>removal</b> <b>procedure,</b> making Eve devoted to Keith in fear that he will leave her alone with her ugliness. Kate considers this punishment enough. Alexandra marries George's psychiatrist, Dr. Peter Templeton, and they have a son named Robert.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from Feb. 14, 2013 - Feb. 14, 2015 Cryopreservation of adherent cells may be advantageous for cell types {{that are difficult to}} preserve in suspension or when it is necessary to preserve characteristics of the adherent cultured cells. Vitrification is a promising procedure for the preservation of adherent cells that prevents ice crystal formation and the resulting dissociation and morphological damage. To successfully vitrify adherent cells, high concentrations of CPA are required which increases the likelihood of osmotic and toxic damage. In this dissertation, we describe a rational design strategy that predicts mathematically optimized CPA addition and <b>removal</b> <b>procedures</b> based on the minimization of a toxicity cost function. These rationally designed procedures rely on the accurate knowledge of cell biophysical parameters. We validate an in situ calcein fluorescence quenching method for the determination of membrane permeability parameters for adherent cells. We also describe the determination of osmotic tolerance limits for adherent cells. We use rational design strategies to determine CPA addition and <b>removal</b> <b>procedures</b> for adherent endothelial cells, neuronal cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells as well as oocytes. Also, we provide experimental support for the feasibility of these methods using adherent endothelial cells. The mathematical methods and experimental procedures outlined in this dissertation are important tools for the design of addition and <b>removal</b> <b>procedures</b> for concentrated CPA solutions. This dissertation is an important step toward successful design and implementation of vitrification strategies for adherent cells and tissues...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundOccupational {{exposures}} to ultrafine {{particles in the}} plume generated during laser hair <b>removal</b> <b>procedures,</b> the most commonly performed light based cosmetic procedure, have not been thoroughly characterized. Acute and chronic {{exposures to}} ambient ultrafine particles {{have been associated with}} a number of negative respiratory and cardiovascular health effects. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} measure airborne concentrations of particles in a diameter size range of 100 nm to 103 Ìbcm in procedure rooms during laser hair <b>removal</b> <b>procedures.</b> MethodsTSI Model 3007 Condensation Particle Counters were used to quantify the particle count concentrations in the waiting and procedure rooms of a dermatology office. Particle concentrations were sampled before, during, and after laser hair <b>removal</b> <b>procedures,</b> and characteristics of each procedure were noted by the performing dermatologist. ResultsTwelve procedures were sampled over 40 days. Mean ultrafine particle concentrations in the waiting and procedure rooms were 14, 957. 4 particles/cm 3 and 22, 916. 8 particles/cm 3 (p 2 Ì 009 < 2 Ì 0090. 0001), respectively. Compared to background ultrafine particle concentrations before the procedure, the mean concentration in the procedure room was 2. 89 times greater during the procedure (p 2 Ì 009 = 2 Ì 0090. 009) and 2. 09 times greater after the procedure (p 2 Ì 009 = 2 Ì 0090. 007). Duration of procedure (p 2 Ì 009 = 2 Ì 0090. 006), body part (p 2 Ì 009 = 2 Ì 0090. 013), and the use of pre-laser lotion/type of laser (p 2 Ì 009 = 2 Ì 0090. 039), were the most important predictors of ultrafine particle concentrations. Use of a smoke evacuator (a recommended form of local exhaust ventilation) positioned at 30. 50 cm from the source, as opposed to the recommended 12 Ì 0132 in., lowered particle concentrations, but was not a statistically significant predictor (p 2 Ì 009 = 2 Ì 0090. 49). ConclusionsLaser hair <b>removal</b> <b>procedures</b> can generate high exposures to ultrafine particles for dermatologists and other individuals performing laser hair removal, with exposure varying based on multiple determinants.
