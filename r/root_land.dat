The main objective {{of this study is to}} explore whether this absence of empirical support for the present value model can be attributed to the restrictiveness of conventional time series methods. I suggest a panel unit root model with two regimes in which the adjustment process may be characterized by the presence of thresholds and discontinuities reflecting the presence of transactions costs and other barriers to adjustment. Using farmland value and cash rents data for 10 agricultural states of the U. S. between 1960 and 2008, empirical findings give modest improvement over the linear unit root process. It is suggested that there might be a bias caused by cross sectional dependence and an inadequate time span of the data.

The microbe isolation of rhizosfir {{can be used to}} overcome pathogen as cause of disease of flour dew and leaf spotted at the apple leaf by antagonist test. The ability of resistivity was value of antagonist ability to pressure the growth of pathogen as cause of flour dew and leaf spotted disease. The research objective was to find out microbe antagonist rhizosfir that can control pathogen of flour dew and leaf spotted disease at the apple. Isolation in this research was conducted at flour dew and leaf spotted disease as pathogen cause of disease. Isolation of rhizosfir uses dilution method as anthagonist microbe. The research sample was taken from Batu town East Java. Microbe as result of isolation was tested by test phases: (1) purification of microbe: (1. a) purification of leaf spotted pathogen and flour dew by observed large of microbe surface during for 7 days, (1. b) purification of antagonist microbe as many microbe gain from rhizosfir, (2) antagonistic test: (2. a) test of antagonist microbe by flour dew pathogen, (2. b) test of antagonist microbe by leaf spotted pathogen, (3) calculation of antagonist resistivity toward flour dew and leaf spotted pathogen on the seventh days after inoculation. Based on calculation, can be concluded that: (1) Gain 2 pathogen as cause of flour dew disease (Podoshaera leucotricha) and leaf spotted (Marssonina coronaria J. J.

40|$|A {{decrease}} in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration during the mid-Palaeozoic is postulated {{to have been}} partially the consequence {{of the evolution of}} <b>rooted</b> <b>land</b> plants. <b>Root</b> development increased the amount of carbonic acid generated by root respiration within soils. This led to increased chemical weathering of silicates and subsequent formation of carbonates, resulting in lower atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. To test this assumption, analog (morphologically equivalent) plant species, ranging from those possessing no roots to those with complex rhizomatous rooting systems, were grown in trays within microcosms at ambient (360 ppm/ 0. 37 mbar) and highly elevated (3500 ppm/ 3. 55 mbar) atmospheric CO 2 concentrations in a controlled environment facility. Substrate CO 2 concentrations increased significantly under elevated atmospheric CO 2, and Equisetum hyemale (L.). The latter is postulated to result from the effects of deeply rooted plants, elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, or both. Plants with simple or no rooting systems or the addition of dead organic matter as a substrate for microorganisms did not enhance substrate CO 2 concentrations...|$|R

Such experience echoes the eco-cosmology of forest societies in Amazonia. The Amerindian cosmology is a "symbolic ecology" (Philippe Descola), that is, "a complex dynamics of social intercourse and transformations between humans and non-humans, visible and invisible subjects" (Bruce Albert); the Amerindian ecology is "a cosmology put into practice" (Kaj Århem), wherein hunted animals and cultivated plants are 'relatives' to be seduced or coerced. Such model appears to be a form of "socialization of nature" (Descola), "humanization of the forest" (Evaristo Eduardo de Miranda) and "indirect anthropization" of Amazonian ecosystems (Descola) which produces "cultural forests" (William Balée) ...|$|R

40|$|Paleosols {{formed by}} {{weathering}} and plant colonization during breaks in eolian deposition of Quaternary loesses {{are marked by}} enhanced magnetic susceptibility. These paleosols can be recognized in the field from their soil structure and soil horizons, but the most obvious and diagnostic feature of paleosols are root traces. For paleosols of early Paleozoic and Precambrian age, pre-dating the evolution of <b>rooted</b> <b>land</b> plants, <b>root</b> traces cannot {{be used as a}} diagnostic field criterion for recognizing paleosols. Surficial enhancement of magnetic susceptibility can be useful confirmation that some Precambrian and early Paleozoic rocks were paleosols. Unfortunately, magnetic susceptibility enhancement of some paleosol profiles is compromised by burial gleization, which reduces overall susceptibility values, but especially susceptibility at the surface of the profile, and produces a marked covariance of magnetic susceptibility with total iron content. Groundwater and surface water gleization during soil formation also depletes susceptibility over a wide range of iron content to give relatively flat depth functions of susceptibility. In contrast, well-drained soils and paleosols have pronounced surficial susceptibility enhancement over a narrow range of iron content. Magnetic susceptibility peaks are useful supporting evidence for paleosols entirely red and oxidized, but not for paleosols with common green-gray reduction spots, abundant organic matter, iron^manganese nodules or other evidence of gleization. All known Paleozoic and Precambrian paleosols have susceptibility an order of magnitude les...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLand {{degradation}} {{has been}} a major political issue in Java for decades. Its causes have generally been framed by narratives focussing on farmers’ unsustainable cultivation practices. This paper causally links land degradation with struggles over natural resources in Central Java. It presents a case study that was part of a research project combining remote sensing and political ecology to explore land use/cover change and its drivers in the catchment of the Segara Anakan lagoon. Historically <b>rooted</b> <b>land</b> conflicts have turned the land into a political battlefield, with soil erosion being the direct outcome of the political struggles. Starting from an analysis of environmental changes using satellite images and historical maps, the research explored a history of violent displacements in the frame of a series of brutal insurgencies and counterinsurgencies in the 1950 / 60 s. In these struggles over national political power, entire villages were erased, and peasants’ land was appropriated by the state. This political history is ‘inscribed’ in today’s landscape. The contested land comprises some of the most erosion-prone sites in the entire catchment of the lagoon. The landscape of erosion is a landscape of conflict and a symbol of historical violence and injustice. In line with our research {{in other parts of the}} catchment, the case study presented here challenges dominant political discourses about the nature of upland degradation in Java. It provides insight into still unresolved and underexplored chapters of Indonesian history and presents a strong plea for combining land use change science and (historical) political ecology...|$|R
