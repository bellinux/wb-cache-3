40|$|Six (6) {{geostationary}} spacecraft, {{manufactured by}} RCA Astro, are presently operating in orbit. All of their batteries are performing well. They all contain unique battery <b>reconditioning</b> circuitry, permitting individual cell <b>reconditioning</b> to practically zero volts without {{the danger of}} cell reversal. This <b>reconditioning</b> is performed just prior to start of each eclipse season. This technique has maintained the battery's end-of-discharge voltage with mission life. The oldest operating RCA Astro geostationary spacecraft, Satcom F 1 and F 2, have now completed almost 7 and 6 - 3 / 4 years in orbit, respectively.

5|$|After {{receiving}} its new aircraft, {{the squadron}} was tasked with anti-shipping attacks, and it and No.100 Squadron cooperated {{in an attack}} on a Japanese convoy near Cape St. George on the night of 20 October during which a No.6 Squadron pilot claimed to have damaged a cruiser. No.6 Squadron also bombed Japanese positions in New Britain during October in conjunction with No.100 Squadron. In addition to these offensive operations, the squadron regularly flew anti-submarine patrols to protect Allied shipping. In November the squadron moved to Goodenough Island and became part of No. 71 Wing RAAF alongside No.8 and No.100 Squadrons. From November 1943 to March 1944, No.6 Squadron took part in attacks on the major Japanese base at Rabaul, and also struck other targets in the region to support the naval and ground forces engaged in the New Britain Campaign. From March the squadron mainly undertook convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols, which proved uneventful.

5|$|On 6June, Wolfe {{received}} {{a message from}} Arnold informing him that the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted a raid to be conducted against Japan as soon as possible. The goals of this operation were to relieve pressure on Chinese forces which were being attacked by the Japanese and to support the invasion of Saipan. Arnold's message also asked how many B-29s could be dispatched on 15 and 20June. At the time, the first raid on Japan was tentatively scheduled for 23June, when sufficient supplies {{were expected to be}} available in China to support 100 B-29 sorties. Wolfe replied stating that 50 B-29s could be used on 15June and 55 if the operation was conducted on the 20th of the month. Arnold regarded these numbers as too low, and directed that a raid by at least 70 B-29s be conducted against Japan on 15June. Following this order, XX Bomber Command's B-29s and transport aircraft embarked on an intensive effort to move fuel to China. Further fuel supplies were made available to the heavy bombers by reducing the activities of USAAF fighter units based in China. During the same period the command's ground crews <b>reconditioned</b> as many B-29s as possible to improve their reliability.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} on-line <b>reconditioning</b> (deep discharge) on a single, Nickel-Hydrogen {{spacecraft}} battery in GEO and LEO is considered.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{reasons for}} {{and benefits of}} <b>reconditioning</b> nickel-hydrogen (NiH 2) batteries used for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) applications. NiH 2 battery cells {{do not have the}} classic discharge voltage problems more commonly associated with nickel-cadmium (NiCd) cells. This is due, in part, to use of hydrogen electrodes in place of cadmium electrodes. The nickel electrode, however, does have a similar discharge voltage signature for both cell designs. This can have an impact on LEO applications where peak loads at higher relative depths of discharge can impact operations. Periodic <b>reconditioning</b> provides information which can be used for analyzing long term performance trends to predict usable capacity to a specified voltage level. The <b>reconditioning</b> process described herein involves discharging NiH 2 batteries at C/ 20 rates or less, to an average cell voltage of 1. 0 volts or less. Recharge is performed at nominal C/ 5 rates to specified voltage/temperature (V/T) charge levels selected to restore required capacity with minimal overcharge. <b>Reconditioning</b> is a process of restoring reserve capacity lost on cycling, which is commonly called the memory effect in NiCd cells. This effect is characterized by decreases in the discharge voltage curve with operational life and cycling. The end effect of <b>reconditioning</b> NiH 2 cells may be hidden in the versatility, of that design over the NiCd cell design and its associated negative electrode fading problem. The process of deep discharge at lower rates by way of <b>reconditioning</b> tends to redistribute electrolyte and water in the NiH 2 cell electrode stack, while improving utilization and charge efficiency. NiH 2 battery <b>reconditioning</b> effects on life are considered beneficial and may, in fact. extend life based on NiCd experience. In any case, usable capacity data obtained from <b>reconditioning</b> is required for performance evaluation and trend analysis. Characterization and life tests have provided the historical data base used to determine the need for <b>reconditioning</b> in most battery applications. The following sections briefly describe the background of NiH 2 battery <b>reconditioning</b> and testing at Lockheed Martin Missiles & Space (LMMS) and other aerospace companies...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this work was to profile the storage {{behavior}} of choice potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivars introduced, cultivated and processed, primarily into crisps, by the local industry in Cyprus. Their cold chipping performance with respect to storage temperature and their potential for <b>reconditioning</b> to acceptable processing quality following long-term cold storage were profiled and evaluated, as an alternative to conventional chemical sprout control. Tuber sugar accumulation patterns, chipping performance, sprouting behavior and tuber fresh weight loss (FWL) were defined and their relations examined. Hypothetical interference of potato crop nitrogen (N) fertilization on cold storage behavior and <b>reconditioning</b> potential was tested. Finally, the application of hot water treatment (HWT) was assessed as a means for improving the effectiveness of <b>reconditioning.</b> Fry color (FCL) demonstrated a highly significant correlation with RS but not with sucrose. A sharp rise in RS content ensued within the first 30 days of storage irrespective of cultivar and temperature. Sprout growth (SG) and FWL did not correlate significantly with FCL. Accumulation patterns throughout cold storage suggest sucrose may function mainly as a transient balance in the starch breakdown process but not as a main repository commanding RS formation. FCL was commercially substandard at 4. 5 °C, acceptable at 8. 5 °C and improved further at 11 °C. Cultivar Hermes demonstrated the most prolonged dormancy and lowest SG and FWL under all storage temperatures. Throughout storage, RS were lowest and FCL superior in cultivars Hermes and Lady Rosetta. <b>Reconditioning</b> improved FCL and reduced RS and sucrose levels in all cultivars but it also induced rapid sprouting and pronounced FWL. The first 15 days of <b>reconditioning</b> were most effective in depleting RS and sucrose and improving FCL. Both FCL and RS following <b>reconditioning</b> were significantly affected by year but cultivar ranking remained unaltered. The levels of RS and FCL but not sucrose during the first 30 days of cold storage might constitute a reliable comparative index of cultivars' <b>reconditioning</b> potential as high RS-accumulating and poor chipping cultivars exhibit inadequate response to <b>reconditioning.</b> Acceptable FCL was attained after 15 days of <b>reconditioning</b> Hermes and 30 days for Lady Rosetta, which incurred excessive FWL, while Diamant and Spunta remained substandard. At harvest, FCL, sucrose and RS content where unaffected by N rate. FCL remained unaffected by N rate during cold storage and <b>reconditioning.</b> N rate did not affect RS during storage and while its effect on sucrose appeared significant, differentiation between N rates was very limited and of no practical importance. During <b>reconditioning</b> both RS and sucrose incurred a marginal and practically insignificant N rate effect. N rate did not affect FWL and SG either during cold storage or <b>reconditioning.</b> Mediterranean climatic conditions which allow for physiological senescence of spring potato crop seem to mitigate the potential interference of preplanting N fertilization with tuber maturation, sugar content and processing quality. When HWT were applied to tubers following cold storage and prior to <b>reconditioning</b> it was demonstrated that for achieving complete inhibition of sprouting the thermal tolerance threshold of the tubers need be exceeded. However, brief HWT were effective in retarding SG and lowering FWL without inflicting thermal damage, or affecting tuber sugar content and processing quality. Prolonged HWT caused extensive thermal damage, loss of membrane integrity and induced an increase in tuber sucrose and RS content resulting in deterioration of FCL in proportion to treatment duration. Although HWT did not improve FCL after <b>reconditioning,</b> future work is needed to evaluate the effect of short-duration treatments on the permissible extend of <b>reconditioning</b> and subsequent processing quality. ...|$|R
