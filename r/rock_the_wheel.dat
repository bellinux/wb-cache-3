60|$|Then Gale saw a raider gallop swiftly {{from the}} group toward the farther outlet of the valley. This might have been owing to {{characteristic}} cowardice; {{but it was more}} likely a move of the raiders to make sure of retreat. Undoubtedly Ladd saw this galloping horseman. A few waiting moments ensued. The galloping horseman reached the slope, began to climb. With naked eyes Gale saw a puff of white smoke spring out of <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b> Then <b>the</b> raider <b>wheeled</b> his plunging horse back to the level, and went racing wildly down the valley.|$|R
60|$|The {{very day}} {{succeeding}} {{the arrival of}} the Sea Lion of the Vineyard, even while his mate was clearing the vessel, Daggett had a gang on the north shore, killing and skinning. As Roswell's rules were rigidly observed, no other change was produced by this accession to the force of the sealers, than additional slaughter. Many more seals were killed, certainly, but all was done so quietly that no great alarm was awakened among the doomed animals themselves. One great advantage was obtained by {{the arrival of the}} new party that occasioned a good deal of mirth at first, but which, in the end, was found to be of great importance to the progress of the work. Daggett had taken to pieces and brought with him the running part of a common country wagon, which was soon found of vast service in transporting the skins and blubber across <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> were separated, leaving them in pairs, and each axle was loaded with a freight that a dozen men would hardly have carried, when two or three hands would drag in the load, with an occasional lift from other gangs, to get them up a height, or over a cleft. This portion of the operation was found to work admirably, owing, in a great measure, to the smooth surfaces of the rocks; and unquestionably these <b>wheels</b> advanced <b>the</b> business of the season at least a fortnight;--Gardiner thought a month. It rendered the crews better natured, too, much diminishing their toil, and sending them to their bunks at night in a far better condition for rest than they otherwise could have been.|$|R
2500|$|Mobility systems: [...] Curiosity is {{equipped}} with six wheels in a rocker-bogie suspension, which also served as landing gear for the vehicle, unlike its smaller predecessors. <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> are significantly larger ( [...] diameter) than those used on previous rovers. Each wheel has cleats and is independently actuated and geared, providing for climbing in soft sand and scrambling over <b>rocks.</b> <b>The</b> four corner <b>wheels</b> can be independently steered, allowing the vehicle to turn in place as well as execute arcing turns. Each wheel has a pattern that helps it maintain traction and leaves patterned tracks in the sandy surface of Mars. That pattern is used by on-board cameras to judge the distance traveled. The pattern itself is Morse code for [...] "JPL" [...] (•−−− •−−• •−••). Based {{on the center of}} mass, the vehicle can withstand a tilt of at least 50 degrees in any direction without overturning, but automatic sensors will limit the rover from exceeding 30-degree tilts.|$|R
5000|$|Detroit (a.k.a. The Band Detroit, {{so as not}} to be {{confused}} with the city of Detroit) was a spinoff of <b>rock</b> group <b>The</b> Detroit <b>Wheels.</b> This revised version of that band was formed by Mitch Ryder as a successor to <b>The</b> <b>Wheels</b> in 1970. <b>The</b> only original <b>Wheel</b> in <b>the</b> group was the drummer Johnny [...] "Bee" [...] Badanjek; other members were guitarists Steve Hunter and Brett Tuggle, organist Harry Phillips and bassist W.R. Cooke. A single album was released by this grouping, a 1971 self-titled LP issued on Paramount Records (US #176 in 1972). They had a hit with their version of the Lou Reed - penned song [...] "Rock & Roll", which Reed liked enough to ask Steve Hunter to join his backing band. Ryder quit the group because of voice problems in 1972, and Detroit vocalist Rusty Day (formerly of the American Amboy Dukes and Cactus) took over his spot; without Ryder, the group floundered, and eventually broke up in 1974.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to its 30,000 seat Main Stage, ChicagoFest featured 16 other stage areas that seated 2,500 to 5,000, that presenting nationally known recording artists.

The Buckinghams and Jan & Dean were among oldies stage headliners. In 1979, when Germany's Scorpions played one of their first American live Concerts on the floating stage at Chicagofest, the Chicago Police Department furnished over one hundred patrol men for show security.

60|$|The air being pure, {{and the day}} fine, {{the party}} {{continued}} conversing on <b>the</b> <b>rock,</b> until <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> of Judge Temple’s carriage were heard clattering {{up the side of}} the mountain, during which time the conversation was maintained with deep interest, each moment clearing up some doubtful action, and lessening the antipathy of the youth to Marmaduke. He no longer objected to the removal of his grand father, who displayed a childish pleasure when he found himself seated once more in a carriage. When placed in the ample hall of the mansion- house, the eyes of the aged veteran turned slowly to the objects in the apartment, and a look like the dawn of intellect would, for moments flit across his features, when he invariably offered some use less courtesies to those near him, wandering painfully in his subjects. The exercise and the change soon produced an exhaustion that caused them to remove him to his bed, where he lay for hours, evidently sensible of the change in his comforts, and exhibiting that mortifying picture of human nature, which too plainly shows that the propensities of the animal continue even after the nobler part of the creature appears to have vanished.|$|R

On 19 September 1970, Lewis appeared at the first Glastonbury Festival (where she jammed with Terry Reid and David Lindley), having been booked by the DJ and concert booker Jeff Dexter. After a chance meeting with Warner Bros. Records executive Ian Ralfini, Lewis signed to Warner Bros. Records imprint label Reprise. Lewis also worked as a session vocalist in this period, which led to her appearance on albums such as Possible Projection of the Future by Al Kooper, David Bowie's Aladdin Sane (1973), Cat Stevens's Catch Bull at Four (1972) and Hummingbird's first album Hummingbird (1975). She then signed to Family's new Warner Brothers distributed [...] "Raft" [...] label.|$|R
50|$|The Chilean mill was {{a machine}} used on gold fields {{in an early}} period of gold mining.

Shamrock pushed out of the pin count and quickly gained the advantage, delivering a belly to belly slam off an Irish whip and then securing his ankle lock {{in the center of the}} ring, making <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> tap. <b>The</b> surrounding members of the Nation jumped into the ring, but Shamrock quickly dispatched them all with suplexes, including the four hundred pound Henry, before reapplying the ankle lock to a bleeding Maivia. Faarooq then ran down from the back and jumped onto the apron, only to look on at <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> with a smile, before walking away. Eventually a number of referees (the ones he attacked were actually independent wrestlers or stuntmen put in referee uniforms) and officials appeared trying to subdue Shamrock, after being surrounded he suplexed a referee and then an official before calming down as <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> was <b>wheeled</b> away on a gurney. Howard Finkel then announced Shamrock had been disqualified for not breaking his ankle hold, causing Shamrock to chase Rock and fight him on the Chris Warren band stage.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{overshot}} <b>wheel</b> was a later {{innovation in}} waterwheels and was around {{two and a}} half times more efficient than the undershot. <b>The</b> undershot <b>wheel,</b> in which <b>the</b> main water <b>wheel</b> is simply set into the flow of the mill race, suffers from an inherent inefficiency stemming from the fact that <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> itself, entering <b>the</b> water behind the main thrust of the flow driving <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> followed by <b>the</b> lift of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> out of <b>the</b> water ahead of the main thrust, actually impedes its own operation. <b>The</b> overshot <b>wheel</b> solves this problem by bringing the water flow to the top of <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> water fills buckets built into <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> rather than <b>the</b> simple paddle <b>wheel</b> design of undershot <b>wheels.</b> As <b>the</b> buckets fill, the weight of the water starts to turn <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> water spills out of the bucket on the down side into a spillway leading back to river. Since <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> itself is set above the spillway, the water never impedes the speed of <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> impulse of the water on <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> is also harnessed in addition to the weight of the water once in <b>the</b> buckets. Overshot <b>wheels</b> require <b>the</b> construction of a dam on the river above the mill and a more elaborate millpond, sluice gate, mill race and spillway or tailrace.|$|R

It {{is not unusual}} for grinding wheels to become out of round with use. This is partially from loaded (clogged) areas of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> wearing at different rates from less loaded areas. It can also be exacerbated by grinding when <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> is not under power, such as using the work to apply braking action to <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> to stop it from coasting. Dressing restores the roundness. When bench grinders vibrate excessively, it is usually because <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> have worn out of round and are thus out of balance. Truing them by dressing resolves this problem.|$|R
