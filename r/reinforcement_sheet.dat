40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for determining the}} ultimate bearing capacity of a circular footing reinforced with a horizontal circular sheet of reinforcement placed over granular and cohesive-frictional soils. It was assumed that the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>sheet</b> could bear axial tension but not the bending moment. The analysis was performed based on the lower-bound theorem of the limit analysis in combination with finite elements and linear optimization. The present research {{is an extension of}} recent work with strip foundations reinforced with different layers of reinforcement. To incorporate the effect of the reinforcement, the efficiency factors eta(gamma) and eta(c), which need to be multiplied by the bearing capacity factors N-gamma and N-c, were established. Results were obtained for different values of the soil internal friction angle (phi). The optimal positions of the reinforcements, which would lead to a maximum improvement in the bearing capacity, were also determined. The variations of the axial tensile force in the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>sheet</b> at different radial distances from the center were also studied.

40|$|Abstract The {{important}} factor for {{design and construction}} of pavement is the behavior of underlying sub-grade. Large deformations in the sub-grade {{will lead to a}} continuous deterioration of the paved surface. As the sub-grade soil is too weak to bear the load engineering solutions such as geo reinforcement using geo-synthetics are additives which are earlier used in sub-grade improvement and such experimental study is carried by pervious authors. This paper deals with the sub-grade improvement using geo-textile as a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>sheet</b> and quarry dust as admixtures. In order to increase the strength of the sub-grade the quarry dust is varied with different percentages i. e. 0 5 10 15 20 and 25. In this study Proctors compaction tests and CBR soaked and unsoaked tests are conducted on locally available soil with reinforced material and with admixture. For this study it is identified that the engineering properties of the soil is improved in all conditions. The soil with quarry dust at optimum value is 20 has CBR soaked value is obtained 6. 83 and unsoaked value is obtained 7. 02 is increased when compared with conventionally soil.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ultimate}} {{bearing capacity}} of a circular footing, placed over a soil mass which is reinforced with horizontal layers of circular reinforcement sheets, has been determined by using the upper bound theorem of the limit analysis in conjunction with finite elements and linear optimization. For performing the analysis, three different soil media have been separately considered, namely, (i) fully granular, (ii) cohesive frictional, and (iii) fully cohesive with an additional provision to account for an increase of cohesion with depth. The reinforcement sheets {{are assumed to be}} structurally strong to resist axial tension but without having any resistance to bending; such an approximation usually holds good for geogrid sheets. The shear failure between the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>sheet</b> and adjoining soil mass has been considered. The increase in the magnitudes of the bearing capacity factors (Nc and Nγ) with an inclusion of the reinforcement has been computed in terms of the efficiency factors ηc and ηγ. The results have been obtained (i) for different values of ϕ in case of fully granular (c= 0) and c−ϕ soils, and (ii) for different rates (m) at which the cohesion increases with depth for a purely cohesive soil (ϕ= 0 ○). The critical positions and corresponding optimum diameter of the reinforcement sheets, for achieving the maximum bearing capacity, have also been established. The increase in the bearing capacity with an employment of the reinforcement increases continuously with an increase in ϕ. The improvement in the bearing capacity becomes quite extensive for two layers of the reinforcements as compared to the single layer of the reinforcement.

40|$|Limit {{analysis}} {{is a very}} powerful tool to find accurate solutions of several geotechnical stability problems. This {{analysis is}} based on the theory of the plasticity and it provides two limiting solutions within lower and upper bounds. With the advancement of the finite elements and different robust optimization techniques, the numerical limit analysis approach in association with finite elements is becoming quite popular to assess the stability of various complicated structures. The present thesis deals with the formulations and the implementation of the finite element limit analysis to obtain the solutions of different geotechnical axisymmetric stability problems. The objectives of the present thesis are twofold: (a) developing limit analysis formulations in conjunction with linear and nonlinear optimizations for solving axisymmetric stability problems related with soil and rock mechanics, and then (b) implementing these axisymmetric formulations for solving various important axisymmetric stability problems in geomechanics. Three noded linear triangular elements have been used throughout the thesis. In order to solve the different problems, the associated computer programs have been written in MATLAB. With reference to the first objective of the thesis, the existing finite element lower bound axisymmetric formulation with linear programming has been presented. A new technique has also been proposed for solving an axisymmetric geomechanics stability problem by employing an upper bound limit analysis in combination with finite elements and linear programming. The method is based on the application of the von-Karman hypothesis to fix the constraints associated with the magnitude of the circumferential stress (), and finally the method involves only the nodal velocities as the basic unknown variables. The required computational effort becomes only marginally greater than that needed for an equivalent plane strain problem. The proposed methodology {{has been found to be}} computationally quite efficient. A new lower bound axisymmetric limit analysis formulation, by using two dimensional finite elements, the three dimensional Mohr-Coulomb (MC) yield criterion, and nonlinear optimization has also been presented for solving different axisymmetric stability problems in geomechanics. The nonlinear optimization was carried out by employing an interior point method based on the logarithmic barrier function. The yield surface was smoothened (i) by removing the tip singularity at the apex of the pyramid in the meridian plane, and (ii) by eliminating the stress discontinuities at the corners of the yield hexagon in the plane. No inherent assumption concerning with the hoop stress needs to be made in this formulation. The Drucker-Prager (DP) yield criterion was also used for computing the lower bound axisymmetric collapse load. The advantage of using the DP yield criterion is that it does not exhibit any singularity in the plane. A new proposal has also been given to simulate the DP yield cone with the MC hexagonal yield pyramid. The generalized Hoek-Brown (HB) yield criterion has also been used. This criterion has been smoothened both in the meridian and  planes and a new formulation is prescribed for obtaining the lower bound axisymmetric problems in rock media in combination with finite elements and nonlinear optimization. With reference to the second objective, a few important axisymmetric stability problems in soil mechanics associated with footings and excavations have been solved in the present thesis. In all these problems, except that of a flat circular footing lying over either homogeneous soil or rock media, it is assumed that the medium is governed by the MC failure criterion and it follows an associated flow rule. For determining the collapse loads for a circular footing over homogenous soil and rock media, the problem has been solved with the usage of Drucker-Prager, Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown criteria. The bearing capacity of a circular footing lying over fully cohesive strata, with an inclusion of a sand layer is evaluated. The effects of the thickness and internal friction angle of the sand layer () on the bearing capacity have been examined for different combinations of cu/(b) and q; where (i) cu defines the undrained shear strength, (ii)  is the unit weight of sand, (iii) b corresponds to the footing radius, and (iv) q is the surcharge pressure. The results have been presented in the form of a ratio () of the bearing capacities with an insertion of the sand layer to that for a footing lying directly over clayey strata. It is noted that an introduction of a layer of medium dense to dense sand over soft clay improves considerably the bearing capacity of the foundation. The improvement in the bearing capacity increases continuously (i) with decreases in cu/(b), and (ii) increases in  and q/(b). The bearing capacity factors, Nc, Nq and N, for a conical footing are obtained in a bound form for a wide range of the values of cone apex angle () and with  = 0 , 0. 5  and . The bearing capacity factors for a perfectly rough ( = conical footing generally increase with a decrease in . On contrary for  = 0 , the factors Nc and Nq reduce gradually with a decrease in . For  = 0 , the factor N for  ≥ 35 o becomes minimum for  approximately equal to 90 o. For  = 0 , the factor N for  ≤ 30 o, like in the case of  = , generally reduces with an increase in . It has also been intended to compute the bearing capacity factors Nc, Nq and N, for smooth and rough ring footing for different combinations of ri/ro and ; where ri and ro refer to inner and outer radii of the ring, respectively. It is observed that for a smooth footing, with a given value of ro, the magnitude of the collapse load decreases continuously with an increase in ri. On the other hand, for a rough base, for a given value of ro, hardly any reduction occurs in the magnitude of collapse load up to ri/ro ≈ 0. 2, whereas beyond this ri/ro, the magnitude of the collapse load, similar to that of a smooth footing, decreases continuously with an increase in ri/ro. An attempt has also been made to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of a circular footing, placed over a soil mass which is reinforced with horizontal layers of circular reinforcement sheets. For performing the analysis, three different soil media have been separately considered, namely, (i) fully granular, (ii) cohesive frictional, and (iii) fully cohesive with an additional provision to account for an increase of cohesion with depth. The reinforcement sheets are assumed to be structurally strong to resist axial tension but without having any resistance to bending; such an approximation usually holds good for geogrid sheets. The shear failure between the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>sheet</b> and adjoining soil mass has been considered. The increase in the magnitudes of the bearing capacity factors (Nc and N) with an inclusion of the reinforcement has been computed in terms of the efficiency factors c and . The critical positions and corresponding optimum diameter of the reinforcement sheets, for achieving the maximum bearing capacity, have also been established. The increase in the bearing capacity with an employment of the reinforcement increases continuously with an increase in . The improvement in the bearing capacity becomes quite extensive for two layers of the reinforcements as compared to the single layer of the reinforcement. The stability of an unsupported vertical cylindrical excavation has been assessed. For the purpose of design, stability numbers (Sn) have been generated for both (i) cohesive frictional soils, and (ii) pure cohesive soils with an additional provision to account for linearly increasing cohesion with depth by using a non-dimensional factor m. The variation of Sn with H/b has been established for different values of m and ; where H and b refer to height and radius of the cylindrical excavation. A number of useful observations have been drawn about the variation of the stability number and nodal velocity patterns with changes in H/b,  and m. In the last, by using the smoothened generalized HB yield criterion, the ultimate bearing capacity of a circular footing placed over a rock mass is evaluated in a non-dimensional form for different values of GSI, mi, ci/(b) and q/ci. For validating the results, computations were exclusively performed for a strip footing as well. For the various problems selected in the present thesis, the failure and nodal velocity patterns have been examined. The results obtained from the analysis have been thoroughly compared with that reported from literature. It is expected that the various design charts presented here will be useful for the practicing engineers. The formulations given in the thesis can also be further used for solving various axisymmetric stability problems in geomechanics...|$|E

The behaviour of local fine soil reinforced with geosynthetics under hydraulic actions was studied using flume tests. The case study was a typical cross section of the walls of the salt pans of the Aveiro lagoon. A preliminary design of a structure was done, for different reinforcements (geogrid, geocomposite, association of geogrid and geotextile). Local soil was collected and characterised using laboratory tests. The flume tests included performing permeability, erosion and overtopping tests, for actions typical of the lagoon environment. The models reinforced with geogrid GGR exhibited the highest global permeability, due to the difficulty of soil lumps to penetrate the geogrid openings. Although this type of reinforcement provides low resistance to erosion, promoting vegetation growth or including other elements can reduce surface erosion. The other <b>reinforcements</b> (<b>sheets)</b> enabled containing the soil. Non-uniformity of the soil compaction caused local differences of permeability. Thus, ensuring uniform compaction on site is necessary; however it can be challenging, particularly for fine soils. The results indicate that seepage is likely to induce some clogging of the reinforcements. The reinforced soil models tested exhibited higher permeability and lower resistance to erosion and overtopping than the traditional solution (soil matrix with vegetation). The results indicate that a possible alternative solution for the walls could use fibre reinforcement. Further work is necessary to ensure adequate (low) permeability of new solutions for these wall...|$|R

There may be difficulty due to poor load-bearing capacity of fly ash, especially when footings rest on the top of the fly ash fill slope; but inclusion of polymeric <b>reinforcements</b> as horizontal <b>sheets</b> within the fill may be advantageous in improving the load-bearing capacity of reinforced fly ash slope. The aim of present investigation is to find out the efficacy of multi layer reinforcements in improving the load-bearing capacity when incorporated within the body of fly ash embankment. An increase in load bearing capacity due to the incorporation of reinforcement layers in the model slope was observed in the laboratory tests. The experimental results were compared with the numerical findings obtained from the finite element analysis using commercial software PLAXIS 2 D version 9. 0...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The uses of {{composite}} {{materials for the}} strengthening of shear deficient concrete structures are limited. The {{research in this area}} has been taking place since 1991. Study in this field aims at understanding the various <b>reinforcement</b> configurations of <b>sheets</b> {{that can be used for}} shear strengthening and also the different failure modes a strengthened beam undergoes at the ultimate state. Furthermore, the experimental data bank for shear strengthening of concrete beams, using FRP, remains relatively sparse due to which the design algorithms for computing the shear contribution of FRP are not yet clear. The objective of this study is to clarify the role of GFRP strips, epoxy bonded to the beam web for shear strengthening of RC beams. Included in the study are effectiveness in terms of width and spacing of vertical GFRP strips, spacing of internal steel stirrups, and longitudinal steel rebar section on shear capacity of the RC beam. The study also aims to understand the shear contribution of concrete, shear strength due to steel bars and steel stirrups, and the additional shear capacity due to glass fiber reinforced polymer strips in a RC beam.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} check out the effects of the method how the FRP sheets wrapped on the axial {{behavior}} of timber columns confined by CFRP sheet, 6 short columns were confined with CFRP sheets in different wrapped ways, i. e. toroidal, single helix, double helix and cross helix. Another column in the same size was prepared as contrast. The ultimate carrying capacity of the specimens was analyzed as well as the load-displacement curves and strain-stress relationships. The comparison of the ultimate carrying capacity showed significant enhancement when the specimens were confined in any ways, and the way wrapping FRP sheets in the toroidal direction was more efficient than other ways in which the FRP sheets wrapped in the experiment. The analysis of the load-displacement curves indicate that the stiffness of the specimens was improved by the <b>reinforcement</b> with FRP <b>sheets</b> in any ways, however, the improvement of the ultimate carrying capacity and the stiffness was in the cost of the ductility. The comparison of the FRP’s train between the specimens with toroidal wrapping method and the helix ones can clearly explain the lower efficiency in the enhancement of ultimate carrying capacity of the specimens with helix wrapping methods...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcements like bars, strips, {{textiles}} and grids {{are used for}} the reinforcement of soil walls {{in the modern era}} of civil engineering, but the use of cellular type of reinforcements is still under consideration and there is still a need of study the probable use of cellular reinforcement in reinforced soil retaining walls. Pullout test is commonly used to predict actual field pullout behaviour of reinforcements. In this paper, laboratory pullout tests are carried out with different height of cellular reinforcements along with planar <b>sheet</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> under two different normal pressures of 75 kPa and 100 kPa. Dimension optimization analysis for cellular reinforcement is done and longitudinal spacing to height ratio of 3. 3 is found as optimum. Finite element method is used to compare the experimental pullout behaviour and found in good accord with the laboratory test results. Experimental results are also compared to the theoretical analysis. It is found that the interference in between transverse member is increasing with increase in height of cellular reinforcement, yet the ultimate pullout resistance is found more with higher reinforcement heights, for spacing to height ratio greater than 3. 3.

40|$|AbstractCarbon fiber <b>reinforcement</b> polymer (CFRP) <b>sheets</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} materials {{that are used to}} strengthen reinforced concrete members due to high strength-to-weight ratio, excellent mechanical strength, and good fatigue properties. In this research program seven reinforced concrete beams were tested under four points loading with different shear span-to-depth ratios avd, longitudinal and vertical reinforcement ratios. A numerical analysis using ANSYS software program was done by modeling 27 reinforced concrete beams with and without CFRP sheets. The beam dimensions, concrete strength, strengthening configuration of the CFRP sheets (full wrapped, U shape, and side bonding), and FRP thickness were considered as the main parameters of the numerical analysis. A comparison between the finite element (FE) results and the ACI standard code demonstrated the validity of the computational models in capturing the structural response of FRP contribution with variation varied from (10 – 16) %, (12 – 20) % and (13 – 19) % for full wrapping, U-jacketing, and side bonding, respectively. The finite element models were able to accurately predict the load capacities for the simulated RC beams strengthened in shear with CFRP composites. The results obtained using ANSYS finite element are relatively identical to the experimental ones, showing reasonable agreement with variation not more than 5 % in all the specimens...|$|R
40|$|The use of coal ash in {{structural}} fills {{to support}} footings and pavements in low lying areas {{can be one}} of the cost effective and environmentally friendly solutions to disposal problems related to coal ash, because wastes can be consumed in large quantities in such applications. The difficulty with this ash disposal solution is that the structural fills may not meet the foundation requirements for bearing capacity and settlement, especially when footings and pavements are constructed near the crest of the ash fill slope. Inclusion of geosynthetic <b>reinforcements</b> as horizontal <b>sheets</b> within the fill may be one of the most viable techniques for improving the load bearing capacity of the coal ash slope. Most technical information available in the literature on the load bearing capacity of footings resting on the slopes is based on small scale laboratory model tests; hence practicing engineers cannot generally adopt the information realistically. Therefore, in the present study as described in this paper, large scale model footing tests were conducted in the laboratory to find out the effectiveness of use of single and multilayer geosynthetic reinforcements in improving the load bearing capacity of coal ash slope. The results were found to be encouraging and they may have practical applications...|$|R
40|$|Externally Bonded FRP Reinforcement (EBR) {{has become}} a popular {{technique}} for Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures strengthening. Several theoretical models, based on the fracture mechanics, have been developed by researchers {{in the last years}} to estimate the debonding load of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) reinforcement applied on concrete surface. Theoretical fracture energy relationships generally include parameters calibrated with experimental data obtained by FRP-concrete bond test. The main available experimental FRP-concrete bond tests show that the most used test procedure is the Single Shear Test (SST) and the largest part of tests involved FRP sheets rather than plates. The results of 34 SST tests carried out by authors on both CFRP sheets (18) and plates (16) are reported and discussed in the present paper; a comparison between plates and <b>sheets</b> <b>reinforcements</b> in terms of debonding load is also given. Based on an enlarged database of FRP-concrete bond tests, a refined calibration of the experimental coefficient {{to be used in the}} design equations provided by CNR-DT 200 / 2004 to compute fracture energy for EBR FRP strengthening has been performed; the calibration has been separately performed for sheets and plates in order to specifically take into account the influence of the type of reinforcement on fracture energy. Finally a comparison between experimental results and theoretical predictions provided by the re-calibrated CNR-DT 200 / 2004 equation, fib bulletin 14 and ACI 440. 2 R- 08 is reported...|$|R
