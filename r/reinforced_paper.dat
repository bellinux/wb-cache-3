40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{mechanical}} properties of paper, 1, 3 and 5 wt. % of sepiolite were dispersed in a poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB) matrix and coated {{onto the surface of}} schrenz (110 g m- 2). Deagglomerated sepiolite nanofibers in PVB matrix on paper surface were observed by scanning electronic microscopy. The glass transition temperature of schrenz with PVB/sepiolite coatings was not changed with increasing content of sepiolite. Two different methods were used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the paper sample reinforced with PVB/sepiolite nanocomposites: tensile testing and nanoindentation. The values of breaking force and tensile energy absorption of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>paper</b> samples obtained by tensile testing were increased by up 10 %. The values of the reduced elastic modulus and hardness obtained by nanoindentation were increased by up to 78 %. The best improvement of the mechanical properties was shown by the paper sample coated with PVB/ 3 wt. % sepiolite nanocomposite. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. III 45019...|$|E
40|$|The use of mulches as a {{reforestation}} tool in Oregon and California began {{primarily in}} the late 1950 's. Many types of mulches were tried including sheets of plastic, newspaper, and plywood; various thicknesses of bark, sawdust, sand, and straw; sprayed-on petroleum resin; and even large plastic buckets. Most proved to be ineffective, costly or both. Early trials tended to use small, short-lived materials that aided conifer seedling survival, but not growth. Compared to other weed-control techniques available at the time, mulches were rather expensive. Current trends are to apply longer-lived, somewhat larger mulches of mostly sheet materials made of <b>reinforced</b> <b>paper,</b> polyester, or polypropylene. When the various costs of mulching (material, installation, and maintenance) are totalled, the overall cost of the technique continues to be high. Recently, new mulch materials of polyester, polypropylene, or combinations of both have allowed silviculturists to consider large, durable mulches (10 by 10 feet or 3 by 3 m) for enhancement of growth (not just survival), an...|$|E
40|$|Responsiveness {{was given}} to the effects of cassava starch and natural rubber as binders on the {{flexural}} strength and the water absorptivity properties of the developed rattan particulate <b>reinforced</b> <b>paper</b> pulp based composites. Paper pulp was produced by chopping waste papers into smaller pieces and soaked in boiled water after which it was stirred thoroughly to form paper pulp. Rattan particulate was produced by hammering, chopping, pounding and milling of rattan canes followed by sieving into a particle size of 437 µ. Varying mass of paper from 300 - 400 g and particulate rattan in treated and untreated form of 2 - 8 g were mixed and bonded with natural rubber and cassava starch, respectively for the various samples developed. The mixtures were thoroughly mixed to produce homogenous pastes and poured into 150 x 50 x 30 mm detachable mould and compacted for 5 minutes using a laboratory compaction machine maintained at 20 KN. The developed composites were allowed to cure at room temperature for 27 days after which flexural and water absorptivity tests were carried out on the samples. It was noticed that the composite samples ST 4 and S 5 containing cassava starch happen to be the best in terms of flexural strength while NR 2 gave the best water- repellent outcome...|$|E
40|$|Acrylonitrile {{is not a}} {{household}} word, but products made from it are ubiquitous in our homes.

Acrylonitrile-based plastics are often impact resistant and are used for computer and video-cassette cases. It is also formulated into nitrile rubber products, which are impervious to most solvents and thus are products of choice to contain gasoline or as protective gloves for lab use.

30|$|Due {{to their}} {{positive}} characteristics, like strength increasing and film generating features, {{they are more}} and more used for various purposes as additives in the paper industry [12, 21, 22]. Currently, the application of nanocellulose [BNC, NFC, and CNC (cellulose nanocrystals)] in paper conservation is increasing quickly, and approaches vary considerably. Santos et al. used BNC sheets prepared as fleeces for lining or <b>reinforcing</b> <b>papers</b> [23, 24]. A novel type of mending paper of BNC fibres and Japanese fibres was developed by Segers et al. [25]. Because of the special surface characteristics, it is well-suited for transparent or coated papers, as well as parchment, and can be used to stabilize or to fill losses [25].|$|R

40|$|A flat {{piece of}} {{corrugated}} fiberboard, {{which has been}} cut, slotted and scored, {{is often referred to}} as a box blank. For several box styles, in order to convert the box blank into a box, its two ends must be fastened together with tape, staples or adhesives such as water soluble glues. The location at which the two ends meet is known as the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s joint. There are several variations within the three fastening techniques mentioned with most corrugated box manufacturers following their own protocols for fastening the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s joints. This study explored the compression and tensile strengths of RSC style corrugated boxes based on adhesive (glue) coverage, three different types of tapes (acrylic, paper and <b>reinforced</b> <b>paper)</b> and application angle of staples. The fabricated boxes were also tested for compression strength and deflection. Test data (N = 10) was collected for each dependent variable of peak force, deflection at peak force and tensile strength using the analysis of variance procedure with a Turkey probability distribution at a 0. 05 critical limit. The results suggest an overall higher tensile strength for glue than the other fastening techniques evaluated (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with no significant difference (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) for peak force or deflection at peak force for all glued, stapled or taped treatments...|$|E
40|$|The {{detrimental}} effects of plastic {{bags on the}} environment are well known. It is now appropriate to use alternative materials for manufacturing bags and in packaging industries. While biodegradable plastics research has gained steam {{in the first world}} countries, countries like India are still dependent upon cheaper alternatives such as kraft paper/ old newspaper (ONP) as packaging materials for transport. However the lacunae associated with the employment of paper bags stem from their poor mechanical properties which make them unsuitable for use as such. The fabrication of jute-fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>paper</b> laminates {{has proven to be a}} promising alternative to plastic bags. The current body of work is pertinent to the design and optimisation of paper bags by employing software using the Finite Elemental Analysis code developed by researchers in the Cornell Fracture Group, namely CASCA and FRANC 2 D. An optimal model was selected by running simulations using area of reinforcement, geometry and height of strip as variables. Simulations were initially run using steel as the material, with the mechanical properties later being changed to that of kraft paper in subsequent models. With the application of height optimized triangular strips, a reduction in peak stress of about 154 KPa was observed. Effective design and optimization lead to a percentage reduction in peak stress by about 77. 78 %...|$|E
