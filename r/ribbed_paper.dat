Half--rather the larger half because of some instinctive right of primogeniture--is {{assigned}} to the elder of my two sons (he is, as it were, its Olympian), {{and the other half}} goes to his brother. We distribute our boards about the sea in an archipelagic manner. We then dress our islands, objecting strongly to too close a scrutiny of our proceedings until we have done. Here, in the illustration, is such an archipelago ready for its explorers, or rather on the verge of exploration. There are altogether four islands, two to the reader's right and two to the left, and the nearer ones are the more northerly; it is as many as we could get into the camera. The northern island to the right is most advanced in civilization, and is chiefly temple. That temple has a flat roof, diversified by domes made of half Easter eggs and cardboard cones. These are surmounted by decorative work of a flamboyant character in plasticine, designed by G. P. W. An oriental population crowds the courtyard and pours out upon the roadway. Note the grotesque plasticine monsters who guard the portals, also by G. P. W., who had a free hand with the architecture of this remarkable specimen of eastern religiosity. They are nothing, you may be sure, to the gigantic idols inside, {{out of the reach of}} the sacrilegious camera. To the right is a tropical thatched hut. The thatched roof is really that nice <b>ribbed</b> <b>paper</b> that comes round bottles--a priceless boon to these games. All that comes into the house is saved for us. The owner of the hut lounges outside the door. He is a dismounted cavalry-corps man, and he owns one cow. His fence, I may note, belonged to a little wooden farm we bought in Switzerland. Its human inhabitants are scattered; its beasts follow a precarious living as wild guinea-pigs on the islands to the south.|$|E

5000|$|The Lost Continental is a light-purple 24¢ United States {{postage stamp}} {{depicting}} General Winfield Scott, printed around 1873 on vertically <b>ribbed</b> <b>paper</b> by the Continental Banknote Company. It {{is the only}} known copy of this 24¢ Scott stamp—among the many surviving examples—that can be positively identified as a printing by the Continental firm, and not by the National Banknote Company, which had originally produced this 24¢ issue three years earlier. [...] For {{more than a century}} experts could not determine with certainty whether Continental had ever, in fact, printed its own version of this stamp—or, if it had done so, whether any of the copies it printed survived. Conclusive evidence did not begin to emerge until a collector named Eraldo Magazzu discovered the Lost Continental while examining a lot of old stamps he had purchased in 1967. Much debate and analysis followed before the stamp, on the evidence of its paper-type, was finally certified as authentic by the Philatelic Foundation in 1992.How many other copies of this Scott issue (if any) printed on normal paper by Continental still exist is a question that philatelists believe will never be answered.

40|$|Abstract: Almost {{all known}} {{structures}} {{are designed for}} low weight and high strength. For metal structures, especially aircrafts and underwater vehicles, this means reinforcement {{in the form of}} <b>ribs.</b> This <b>paper</b> presents an analytic model for the prediction of the acoustic scattered field from such rib-reinforced structures. The geometry is assumed to be that of an infinite elastic plate reinforced with a periodic double array of stiffeners. The plate is assumed to be in contact with a homogeneous and isotropic fluid on one side only, its other side being exposed to vacuum. The plate is modeled using the Mindlin plate theory which includes the effects of shear deformation and rotary inertia, thus allowing the evaluation of the scattered acoustic field at frequencies above the coincidence frequency. The reinforcements, exerting both forces and moments on the plate, are included in the model through their transverse and rotational impedances. A Fourier transform technique is used for evaluating the acoustic scattering of an incident plane acoustic wave by the fluid-loaded, reinforced plate and analytic solutions for the backscattered acoustic field are obtained. Numerical results {{for a wide range of}} frequencies are also presented. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{capabilities}} of the two computational intelligence technologies including neural network and fuzzy logic can be synergized through {{the formation of an}} integrated and unified model which capitalizes on the benefits and concurrently offsets the flaws of the involved technologies. In this paper, a neural-fuzzy model, which is characterized by its ability to suggest the appropriate change of process parameters in a relatively complex parameter-based control situation involving multiple parameters, is presented. This model is particularly useful in multiple input and multiple output situations where complex mathematical calculations are required if conventional control approach is adopted. In particular, it serves to acquire knowledge from the information base for extracting rules, which are then fuzzified based on fuzzy principle. To validate the feasibility of this approach, a test has been conducted based on the neural-fuzzy model with the objective to achieve heat transfer enhancement in rectangular ducts using transverse <b>ribs.</b> This <b>paper</b> describes the roadmap for the deployment of this hybrid model to enhance machine intelligence of a complex system with the description of a case study to exemplify its underlying principles.

The three-manual harpsichord in the National Music Museum (described above) was studied in detail by John Koster during the time it was in his possession.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there are more}} and more {{structures}} made of composite materials, especially in the form of thin-walled shells, being applied in various fields of technology. When using composite materials such as concrete or fiberglass, reinforcing elements are often placed along the axes of the curvilinear coordinate system of the shell, and in this case, the structure can be considered as orthotropic. There are a lot of papers on the calculation of orthotropic shells, but they do not adequately investigate a number of important factors that influence the stress-strain state of the shell and its stability. In particular, the calculation of reinforced shells does not take into account such factors as in-plane shear, shear and torsional stiffness of <b>ribs,</b> etc. The <b>paper</b> presents the mathematical model of deformation of thin orthotropic shells of revolution, based on the model of Timoshenko – Reissner. The model takes into account the design of reinforcement with the shear and torsional stiffness of the ribs, geometric nonlinearity and also the irregular shape of the shell.

40|$|The {{identification}} of key features (e. g. organs and tumours) in medical scans (CT, MRI, etc.) {{is a vital}} first step in many other image analysis applications, but {{it is by no}} means easy to identify such features automatically. Using statistical properties of image regions alone, it is not always possible to distinguish between different features with overlapping greyscale distributions. To do so, it helps to make use of additional knowledge that may have been acquired (e. g. from a medic) about a patient’s anatomy. One important form this external knowledge can take is localization information: this allows a program to narrow down its search to a particular region of the image, or to decide how likely a feature candidate is to be correct (e. g. it would be worrisome were the aorta identified as running through the middle of a kidney). To make use of this information, however, it is necessary to identify a suitable frame of reference in which it can be specified. This frame should ideally be based on rigid structures, e. g. the spine and <b>ribs.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we present a method for automatically identifying the spine in image partition forests of abdominal CT slices as a first step towards defining a robust coordinate system for localization. 1...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{analyses}} and experimental works on animal hard materials artefacts have been sparsely {{applied in the}} Italian territory, especially in Bronze Age contexts. Recent researches, carried out on several sets of artefacts coming from sites dated between the Middle and Late Bronze Age in north-eastern Italy, have highlighted {{a good amount of}} bevel on large ungulate <b>ribs.</b> This <b>paper</b> aims at identifying the function of these objects through an experimental work, in order to reproduce the same category of artefacts that have been utilized on different materials and in different ways. The analyses of the archaeological remains and the experimental artefacts were performed at low magnification using a stereomicroscope Leica EC 3 S 6 D with an integrated digital camera. Then, the surface analysis at high magnification was carried out by using a metallographic microscope in reflected and transmitted light (Optika Met: 50 ×– 500 ×). The experiments were carried out using the experimental tools on various hard materials, such as wood (fresh and dry) and antler (dry and wet) and elastic ones (fresh and dry skin). During the testing phase, the time of use, the state of the material processed, the gestures employed (direction and quantity) were monitored and recorded. All the archaeological artefacts bear almost similar use-wear patterns. Some of them have fractures and micro-chipped areas on the distal margin that indicate contact with a hard and durable material. The remaining artefacts, however, present edges slightly smoothened and with less evident anomalies. On the upper face, use-wear ends after about 5 mm from the distal edge, while on the lower face it seems to be slightly larger, about 1 cm from the edge. Under the microscope, very dense longitudinally-oriented striations are visible on the distal edge, while in the mesial portion of the artefact, they proceed to become rarer and often oblique. Under high magnification, the analysed surfaces are fairly uniform near the edge and more irregular at farther distances from it. The experimental work has allowed us to hypothesize that some of these artefacts were used for the removal of fresh and dry bark. In fact, experimental use-wear presents macro-and micro-morphologies compatible with the ones detected on the archaeological remains...|$|R
40|$|System {{studies have}} shown that large {{deployable}} aerodynamic decelerators such as the Adaptive Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT) concept can revolutionize future robotic and human exploration missions involving atmospheric entry, descent and landing by significantly reducing the maximum heating rate, total heat load, and deceleration loads experienced by the spacecraft during entry [1 - 3]. ADEPT and the Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) [4] share the approach of stowing the entry system in the shroud of the launch vehicle and deploying it to a much larger diameter prior to entry. The ADEPT concept provides a low ballistic coefficient for planetary entry by employing an umbrella-like deployable structure consisting of ribs, struts and a fabric cover that form an aerodynamic decelerator capable of undergoing hypersonic flight. The ADEPT "skin" is a 3 -D woven carbon cloth that serves as a thermal protection system (TPS) and as a structural surface that transfers aerodynamic forces to the underlying <b>ribs</b> [5]. This <b>paper</b> focuses on design activities associated with integrating ADEPT components (cloth, ribs, struts and mechanisms) into a system that can function across all configurations and environments of a typical mission concept: stowed during launch, in-space deployment, entry, descent, parachute deployment and separation from the landing payload. The baseline structures and mechanisms were selected via trade studies conducted during the summer and fall of 2012. They are now being incorporated into the design of a ground test article (GTA) that will be fabricated in 2013. It will be used to evaluate retention of the stowed configuration in a launch environment, mechanism operation for release, deployment and locking, and static strength of the deployed decelerator. Of particular interest are the carbon cloth interfaces, underlying hot structure, (Advanced Carbon- Carbon ribs) and other structural components (nose cap, struts, and main body) designed to withstand the pressure and extremely high heating experienced during planetary entry...|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} cooling of {{turbine blades}} {{is an important}} part of overall blade cooling that is necessary to survive current turbine inlet temperatures. This internal cooling is often performed by means of rib-turbulated passages designed to provide maximum heat transfer coefficients. One determining factor in the cooling effectiveness is the flow pattern created by the <b>ribbed</b> channel. This <b>paper</b> presents a comparison of the effect of two different channel blockage ratios on the fully developed flow pattern in a stationary ribbed channel. For the experimental investigation, a scaled-up ribbed passage was tested using a closed-loop channel facility. The facility included a passage consisting of a developing region, a fully developed region, a 180 ° bend, and a second developing region following the bend. Friction factors were determined through the use of pressure taps throughout the channel, and flow fields were measured using a two-component laser Doppler velocimeter. A majority of the testing performed was done under conditions of in-line (i. e. non-staggered) ribs with ratios of rib height to channel hydraulic diameter of 0. 10 and 0. 17. All LDV measurements were performed at a Reynolds number of 20, 000. Results indicate that both blockage ratios create significant recirculation regions immediately before and immediately following the rib. While the smaller rib results indicate a reattachment downstream of the rib, the larger rib results indicate that the flow is separated along the entire streamwise distance between the ribs. The smaller blockage ratio also indicated a small recirculation region directly on top of the rib, whereas the larger blockage ratio showed no such region. Additionally, the increased friction factor created by the larger ribs can be attributed to the larger recirculation regions between ribs...|$|R
