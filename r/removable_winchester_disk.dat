5000|$|The P8000 is a {{microcomputer}} system developed in 1987 by the VEB Elektro-Apparate-Werke Berlin-Treptow „Friedrich Ebert“ (EAW) in the German Democratic Republic (DDR, East Germany). It consisted of an 8-bit and a 16-bit microprocessor and a <b>Winchester</b> <b>disk</b> controller. It {{was intended as}} a universal programming and development system for multi-user/multi-task applications.

50|$|The model {{could be}} expanded, either by adding {{another pair of}} 5.25 inch floppy disk drives, and it could also support either an {{additional}} pair of RX01 or RX02 8-inch floppy disk drives or a <b>winchester</b> <b>disk.</b> It can also have a coprocessor board added, {{to allow it to}} run CP/M. There was a choice of three coprocessor boards, one with a Z80 and 64 KB RAM, and a choice of two boards with both a Z80 and an Intel 8086, the difference being that they had either 256 KB or 512 KB RAM. Manufacture ceased in 1986. It was superseded by the DECmate III, introduced in 1984.|$|R
50|$|The Advantage was a 4 MHz Z80a-based {{computer}} with 64 KB of user RAM and 16 KB of graphics RAM. It used two single-sided, double-density 180 KB floppy disk (hard-sectored) drives and an optional 5 MB <b>Winchester</b> <b>disk.</b> The Advantage {{was known for}} its 640×240 graphics capabilities and was sold with four demonstration programs, one of which plotted and calculated a pattern of lines reminiscent of the Arcade game Qix. The Advantage also had an optional 8088 co-processor board available that ran MS-DOS 1.0.

40|$|An {{airborne}} C-band scatterometer system (C-Scat) {{has been}} developed to remotely sense ocean surface winds and improve upon the present {{understanding of the relationship}} between normalized radar cross section (NRCS) and ocean surface roughness influences such as wind speed and direction, wave height and slope, and the air-sea temperature difference. The scatterometer utilizes a unique frequency-steered microstrip array antenna that is installed beneath the fuselage of an airplane. The antenna is electronically scanned in elevation, from 20 deg to 50 deg off-nadir, and mechanically spins in azimuth. The system is capable of measuring ocean surface NRCS from altitudes as high as 25, 000 ft. The transmitter and receiver operate from 4. 98 to 5. 7 GHz. System parameters such as transmitter pulse width, pulse repetition frequency, output power level, and receiver bandwidth are programmable. Received signals can be averaged and displayed in real time and are stored on a <b>Winchester</b> <b>disk</b> drive for post-flight analysis. Preliminary flight data that demonstrates the instrument's performance is presented...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the investigation of algorithms and architectures for computer recognition of human speech. Three speech recognition algorithms have been implemented, using (a) Walsh Analysis, (b) Fourier Analysis and (c) Linear Predictive Coding. The Fourier Analysis algorithm made use of the Prime-number Fourier Transform technique. The Linear Predictive Coding algorithm made use of LeRoux and Gueguen's method for calculating the coefficients. The system was organised so that the speech samples could be input to a PC/XT microcomputer in a typical office environment. The PC/XT was linked via Ethernet to a Sun 2 / 180 s computer system which allowed the data to be stored on a <b>Winchester</b> <b>disk</b> so that the data used for testing each algorithm was identical. The recognition algorithms were implemented entirely in Pascal, to allow evaluation to take place on several different machines. The effectiveness of the algorithms was tested with a group of five naive speakers, results being in the form of recognition scores. The results showed the superiority of the Linear Predictive Coding algorithm, which achieved a mean recognition score of 93. 3...|$|R

The Stofor range was based on a 4 MHz Zilog Z80 processor with 64K RAM and provided from 4 to 64 ports. Early models, and some later ones, were floppy disk based but later and larger versions had 10Mb <b>Winchester</b> technology hard <b>disks</b> for storage. Stofor was the only message switching system of its size to boast a custom text editor designed by Fenwood with the needs of the telex user in mind.

40|$|The normal (real) {{modes of}} a <b>Winchester</b> type hard <b>disk</b> drive were {{determined}} {{in the frequency}} range 0 - 2200 hz. Two methods of analysis were used {{in order to allow}} cross-correlation of the results. Experimental modal analysis was performed using Structural Measurement Systems 2 ̆ 7 (SMS) Modal 3. 0 analysis system and the requisite experimental hardware. A finite element analysis was also performed using MSC/NASTRAN; the NASTRAN model was created using the PATRAN pre-processing program. In order to alleviate the complications associated with matching the structural mounting conditions, a free-free analysis was performed using NASTRAN, and a light string was used to free mount the test specimen for the experimental work. The two analyses showed a one-to-one correspondence of modes; both showed 15 modes in the frequency range. Deviations of the NASTRAN natural frequencies from the experimentally determined natural frequencies ranged from - 22 percent to + 11. 7 percent. Of the 15 modes, 10 showed deviation magnitudes of 10 percent or less, and 6 of the 15 were below 5 percent. Mode shape correlation was performed solely by observation. Errant DOFs in the experimental mode shapes made correlation difficult for several of the modes. In particular, the modes which showed higher frequency deviation (in excess of 10 percent) did not yield exact mode shape correlation although the primary deflection patterns were similar...|$|R
