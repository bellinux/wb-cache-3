METHODS: In this cross-sectional study at a pediatric unit, drugs were distributed in a centralized and unique manner.

Bar code scanning for medication administration (BCMA) provides a viable solution to preventing errors. The BCMA has had a strong, positive reception, and hospitals have seen a significant reduction in medication errors. However, barriers to workflow with the BCMA have prompted nurses to develop workarounds, undermining the purpose of the technology to prevent medication errors. Purpose: The goal of this pilot study is to develop a survey tool that specifically focuses on the causes of the workarounds by nurses. Information obtained from the survey will highlight areas that may require redesign of the BCMA. Securing an effective BCMA system will produce higher compliance increasing patient safety.

Materials and Methods. Twenty-four healthy patients requiring bilateral surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars were successfully enrolled for this study. Depth of impaction, angulation, and relationship of the lower third molars with the mandibular branch had to be overlapping on both sides. A split-mouth design was chosen, so each patient underwent both {{the first and second}} surgeries, having for each extraction a different antibiotic route <b>of</b> <b>administration.</b> The second extraction was carried out 1 month later. To compare the effects of the two routes <b>of</b> antibiotic <b>administration,</b> inflammatory parameters, such as edema, trismus, pain, fever, dysphagia and lymphadenopathy were evaluated 2 and 7 days after surgery. Side effects of each therapy were evaluated 48 h after surgery.
