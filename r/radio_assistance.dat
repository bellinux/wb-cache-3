"Jesus Freak", {{which served}} as the lead-off single for the album of the same name, was {{released}} in 1995 to alternative and modern rock stations, the band's first venture into these radio formats. Because the song [...] which is defined by a dark, grunge sound [...] was released during an era when alternative rock was ruling the airwaves, the song was played on some non-Christian stations. As part of the promotion strategy for the song, InterLinc, a Nashville-based Christian music promotion company, sent out over 4,000 copies of the CD single to youth pastors, along with Bible study material. The single initially charted on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles at number 25 with little mainstream <b>radio</b> <b>assistance.</b> The song peaked at number 10.|$|E

50|$|Sometime {{after the}} fall of the Soviet Union, Shatalov {{received}} an upgraded Crimson Dynamo armor, less bulky than Bukharin's model, and with silver accents, this was the first Crimson Dynamo armor that was not completely crimson. Shatalov later met Tony Stark in person, when the latter traveled to Russia to oversee the opening of the first Stark Enterprises branch in the country, and revealed to Stark that he had kept his identity as Iron Man a secret. Stark's trip to Russia was interrupted by the rampage of the Titanium Man, Boris Bullski, who still could not accept the new Russia, and saw Stark's presence in his homeland as an affront to everything he believed the U.S.S.R. stood for. As the Titanium Man fought Iron Man, the Black Widow, and the Crimson Dynamo, Shatalov's leg was broken. He begged Iron Man not to finish the fight with Bullski, as he felt having the American Avenger take down a former Soviet hero would be too damaging to his country's morale. Stark volunteered to wear the Dynamo armor in Shatalov's place, and with <b>radio</b> <b>assistance</b> from Shatalov and the Widow, fought Bullski. When Bullski refused to surrender, Shatalov overrode Stark's control of the Dynamo armor, firing a blast that killed Bullski. Shatalov took the fall with his superiors, who had wanted to recover Bullski alive, and he was relieved of his duties as Crimson Dynamo.|$|E

40|$|At present radio {{communications}} and <b>radio</b> <b>assistance</b> services aboard aircrafts and helicopters are generally scattered {{among a number}} of antennas and sensors across the whole airframe. This policy, which is probably convenient {{from the point of view}} of equipment procurement, inevitably causes installation problems on medium/small aircraft, helicopters and UAVs, where only a reduced portion of the airframe surface is usually available for antenna location. Consequently, performance reductions have to be accepted, both due to antenna pattern distortion from the aircraft structures and to EMI among the sensors. This problem will probably become even more serious on multi-role vehicles, where different requirements have to be satisfied depending on the mission goal. A possible solution to the problem of antenna proliferation could be found in the field of conformal and multi-band antennas. An activity of analysis, modelling and evaluation has been performed and has dealt with the following main items: a) system level analyses aimed at identifying possible synergies between radio services; b) identification of multi-band antennas suitable for working with standard avionic equipment; c) identification of possible conformal radiating structures...|$|E
