40|$|This is a {{supplement}} to the main paper, having the same title. In this work we develop methods to study the impact upon steady-state performance of <b>delay</b> <b>announcements</b> made to arriving customers in a many-server queue with customer abandonment. We assume that the queue is not visible to waiting customers, as in most customer contact centers, when contact is made by telephone, email or instant messaging. We propose simple robust announcement schemes: (i) the delay of the last served (DLS) customer and (ii) a fixed <b>delay</b> (FD) <b>announcement</b> based on an appropriate long-run average delay. For any single-number <b>delay</b> <b>announcement</b> made immediately upon arrival, customers may balk or have new abandonment behavior {{as a function of}} the announced delay. We introduce a model of that customer response. To perform a rough-cut performance analysis, prior to detailed simulation, we introduce a fluid model, which provides an approximate and highly simplified description for large systems in an overloaded regime. In the fluid model, all customers are faced with the same delay and consequently can be given the same <b>delay</b> <b>announcement.</b> That property motivates considering a second approximation scheme: an equilibrium fixed <b>delay</b> <b>announcement</b> in the stochastic model, which we compute approximately using an iterative numerical algorithm (INA). We show that these two approximate descriptions of aggregate performance are effective by com-paring to simulations. We simulate systems with state-dependent DLS announcements and we iterate over simulations using fixed <b>delay</b> <b>announcements.</b> Here we present additional material, supplementing the main paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} impact of making <b>delay</b> <b>announcements</b> to arriving cus-tomers who must wait before starting service in a many-server queue with customer abandon-ment. The queue {{is assumed to}} be invisible to waiting customers, as in most customer contact centers, when contact is made by telephone, email or instant messaging. As a function of the announced delay, customers may balk or have new abandonment behavior. Typically, <b>delay</b> <b>announcements</b> cause some customers to leave earlier without receiving service, and reduce the delays of served customers. To provide customers a transparent delay estimate (if they must wait), customers are told upon arrival either the delay of the last served customer or an appropriate average <b>delay.</b> These <b>announcement</b> schemes are simple and robust; e. g., they do not depend on assumed structure for the service mechanism. Models for the customer response are proposed. For a rough-cut performance analysis, prior to detailed simulation, two approximations are proposed: (1) the equilibrium delay in a deterministic fluid model and (2) the equilibrium steady-state delay in a stochastic model with fixed <b>delay</b> <b>announcements.</b> These methods are shown to be effective in overloaded regimes, where <b>delay</b> <b>announcements</b> are important, by making comparisons with simulations. Within the fluid-model framework, conditions are established for the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium delay, where the actual delay coincides with the announced delay. Multiple equilibria can occur if a key monotonicity condition is violated...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we analyze a {{call center}} with {{impatient}} customers. We study how informing customers about their anticipated delays affects performance. Customers react by balking upon hearing the <b>delay</b> <b>announcement</b> and may subsequently renege, {{particularly if the}} realized waiting time exceeds the delay that has originally been announced to them. The balking and reneging from such a system are {{a function of the}} <b>delay</b> <b>announcement.</b> Modeling the call center as an M/M/s + M queue with endogenized customer reactions to announcements, we analytically characterize performance measures for this model. The analysis allows us to explore the role announcing different percentiles of the waiting time distribution, i. e., announcement coverage, plays on subsequent performance in terms of balking and reneging. Through a numerical study, we explore when informing customers about delays is beneficial and what the optimal coverage should be in these announcements. We show how managers of a call center with <b>delay</b> <b>announcements</b> can control the trade-off between balking and reneging through their choice of announcements to be made...|$|R

We propose a formal simulation model in which relevant resource requirements during the hospitalisation of a patient are represented by an original ‘multistage treatment model’. Other key components of the formal model include impatience of patients, resource capacities and key performance indicators such as the original concept of waiting time visibility. Through sensitivity analysis of the simulation model, we demonstrate the benefits of <b>delay</b> <b>announcement</b> and the value of our ‘multistage treatment model’...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} {{on the effect of}} product introduction delays on accounting-based measures of operating performance. Based on a diverse set of 450 publicly traded firms that experienced product introduction delays, we find that delays have a statistically significant negative effect on profitability. Depending on the method used to estimate abnormal performance, the median abnormal decline in return on assets (ROA) ranges from 2. 70 % to 3. 44 % over a three-year period around the year of the <b>delay</b> <b>announcement.</b> The median decline in sales over assets ranges from 5. 92 % to 10. 99 %, and the median decline in return on sales ranges from 1. 48 % to 3. 06 %. Cross-sectional regression analysis indicates that the impact of delays on abnormal ROA is more negative for smaller firms, and for firms that are more profitable before the delay. Furthermore, the impact is more negative for firms that operate in industries that are larger and more profitable. We also find a positive association between abnormal ROA and abnormal stock price performance around the product introduction <b>delay</b> <b>announcements.</b> product introduction <b>delays,</b> empirical analysis, operating performance...|$|R
