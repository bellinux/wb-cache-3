Methodology: The general part of this bachelor thesis contains theoretical findings about anatomy of the peripheral nervous system, peripheral paresis clinical image, treatment and follow-up therapy. The special part contains a description of selected physioterapeutic methods in practice. Results: Reduction of a degree of shortening of selected muscles, elimination of reflexive mutations <b>of</b> soft tissues, <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> play and strength enhancement of selected weakened muscles. Conclusion: Physiotheraphy {{is an integral part}} of peripheral paresis treatment. Key words: physiotherapy, neurology, paresis, peroneus, rehabilitatio...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to explore}} the gap between theory and {{practice}} in foresight and to give some suggestions on how to reduce it. Design/methodology/approach – Analysis of practical foresight activities and suggestions are based on a literature review, the author's own research and practice in the field of foresight and futures studies, and her participation in the work of a European project (COST A 22). Findings – Two different types of practical foresight activities have developed. One of them, the practice of foresight of critical futures studies (FCFS) is an application of a theory of futures studies. The other, termed here as praxis foresight (PF), has no theoretical basis and responds directly to practical needs. At present a gap can be perceived {{between theory and practice}}. PF distinguishes itself from the practice and theory of FCFS and narrows the construction space of futures. Neither FCFS nor PF deals with content issues of the outer world. Reducing the gap depends on <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> discourses and research about experience of different practical foresight activities and manageability of complex dynamics in foresight. Production and feedback of self-reflective and reflective foresight knowledge could improve theory and practice. Originality/value – Contemporary practical foresight activities are analysed and suggestions to reduce the gap are developed {{in the context of the}} linkage between theory and practice. This paper is thought provoking for futurists, foresight managers and university researchers...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavioural}} therapies predominantly use {{exposure to}} feared stimuli {{in the treatment}} of anxiety disorders. However, clients frequently experience a return of fear after treatment and this may increase the likelihood of relapse occurring. Return of fear via a renewal effect is the most frequently studied source of return <b>of</b> fear. <b>Renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear occurs when the previously feared object is encountered in a context that is different to the treatment context. The present chapter reviews clinical-analogue studies that have investigated the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear. Prior research has confirmed the validity <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> as a mechanism for the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear in high fearful and phobic individuals. Moreover, prior research has shown that factors such as phobic cognitions and pre-treatment fear can predict the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear occurring. The review also highlights the methodologies used to detect <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear and subsequently reduce <b>renewal.</b> Applications <b>of</b> the research to reduce the return <b>of</b> fear via <b>renewal</b> following exposure therapy are discussed.
