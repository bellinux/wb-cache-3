40|$|Time headway data {{generated}} from different rain conditions were fitted to probability distributions {{to see which}} ones best described the trends in headway behaviour in wet weather.  Data was {{generated from}} the J 5, a principal road in Johor Bahru for two months and the headways in no-rain condition were analysed and compared to the rain generated headway data. The results showed a decrease in headways between no-rain and the rain conditions. Further decreases were observed with increase in rainfall intensity. Thus between no-rain to light <b>rain</b> <b>condition</b> there was 15. 66 % reduction in the mean headways. Also the mean headway reduction between no-rain and medium <b>rain</b> <b>condition</b> is 19. 97 % while the reduction between no-rain and heavy <b>rain</b> <b>condition</b> is 25. 65 %. This trend is already acknowledged in the literature. The Burr probability distribution ranked first amongst five others in describing the trends in headway behaviour during rainfall. It passed the goodness of fit tests for the K-S, A 2 and C-S at 95 % and 99 % respectively. The scale parameter of the Burr model and the P-value increased as the rain intensity increased. This suggests more vehicular cluster during rainfall with the probability of this occurring increasing with more rain intensity. The coefficient of variation and Skewness also pointed towards increase in vehicle cluster. The Burr Probability Distribution therefore {{can be applied to}} model headways in rain and no-rain weather conditions among others...|$|E

Nowadays, it used for last mile solution of metro network, within campus and for military system. The advantages of FSO are it offers the abundance of unregulated bandwidth, high data rate, security, and lower cost for equipment and deployment. The main constrain in FSO transmission channel is attenuation caused by several of weather conditions such as rain and haze conditions that cause the degradation of performance signal. This paper is about the comparison of haze attenuations in FSO between September 1997 and September 2007 at Petaling Jaya region. The largescale air qualify disaster occur that effect widespread atmosphere visibility due to fires in Kalimantan forest is the reason on choosing haze effect on September 1997. This paper also compared between the distance of FSO transmission for 300 m and 500 m distance in <b>rain</b> <b>condition.</b> The data for visibility for both years are obtained from Malaysia Metrological Department (MMD) while the data of rain intensity is obtained from previous student This project uses LED as a transmitter and PIN photodiode as a receiver with wavelength 1310 nm where considered for short distance transmission of 300 m and 500 m.

40|$|Water {{level is}} an {{important}} index for studying hydrologic processes. Water level rise processes were studied in three catchments (catchment I, II, III in Chen Jiagou watershed in the Three Gorge Reservoir Area) with different areas to provide useful information to inform data extension from a gauged-catchment to an ungauged catchment. The results showed that there are seasonal changes in the dominant driving mode {{of the rise of}} the water level. The rise of the water level in March is likely mainly driven by the mode of stored-full runoff, and in September or October, it is mainly driven by Horton-flow. The correlation coefficients of all indexes were significant among the three catchments, suggesting that these catchments have similarities and that water level data extension is likely to be completed successfully between the large catchment (III-Catchment) and the small catchment (I-Catchment). It was confirmed that there is good similarity between the 0. 6 km 2 and 6 km 2 catchments, and the data correlation is good between the catchments with the area differences in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area.

40|$|Abstract- The {{experimental}} study of emission current from the lightning protection devices is presented. Emission currents were measured using switching impulse voltage. A metal screen was used to provide simulation of a charged cloud. Measurements of emission current from a Franklin Rod and three configurations of static dissipation devices were conducted in the high voltage laboratory under different environmental conditions. The measurements of emission current were conducted for: no rain or wind, with low and high wind, and with light and heavy rain. The generated switching impulse in this test had a time-to-peak of 250 s and a time-to-half-value of 2000 s, {{both positive and negative}} polarity. Measurements were taken at 3 m and 4 m air gap spacing from the metal screen to the test device. The presented emission current is averaged from three measurements for the same voltage magnitude and polarity of the applied impulse. For each of the three devices, four different levels of voltages were applied from 800 kV to 1100 kV at positive and negative polarity. From the conducted study of the emission current of four lightning protection devices, several conclusions were stated. The study shows emission current is highest for the heavy <b>rain</b> <b>condition.</b> The applied wind speeds up to 2 m/s did not have an impact on emission current.

40|$|We {{visualize}} {{the formation of}} fingered flow in dry model sandy soils under different rain conditions using a quasi- 2 D experimental setup and systematically determine {{the impact of the}} soil grain diameter and surface wetting properties on the water channeling phenomenon. The model sandy soils we use are random closely packed glass beads with varied diameters and surface treatments. For hydrophilic sandy soils, our experiments show that rain water infiltrates a shallow top layer of soil and creates a horizontal water wetting front that grows downward homogeneously until instabilities occur to form fingered flows. For hydrophobic sandy soils, in contrast, we observe that rain water ponds {{on the top of the}} soil surface until the hydraulic pressure is strong enough to overcome the capillary repellency of soil and create narrow water channels that penetrate the soil packing. Varying the raindrop impinging speed has little influence on water channel formation. However, varying the rain rate causes significant changes in the water infiltration depth, water channel width, and water channel separation. At a fixed <b>rain</b> <b>condition,</b> we combine the effects of the grain diameter and surface hydrophobicity into a single parameter and determine its influence on the water infiltration depth, water channel width, and water channel separation. We also demonstrate the efficiency of several soil water improvement methods that relate to the rain water channeling phenomenon, including prewetting sandy soils at different levels before rainfall, modifying soil surface flatness, and applying superabsorbent hydrogel particles as soil modifiers...|$|E

Even under rainy condition, 10 and 6 GHz data are not saturated, so wind speed {{will be able to}} be retrieved by using those horizontal data. Retrieval accuracy of wind speed using 10 and 6 GHz will become worse than using 37 GHz, since a sensitivity of 10 and 6 GHz to wind speed is not so strong. 2.
