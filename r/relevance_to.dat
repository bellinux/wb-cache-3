5|$|In {{the music}} video Mutual Core {{directed}} by Andrew Thomas Huang, Björk is organically {{part of nature}} and universe. The human connection to nature is a theme that underpins most of her artistic output.

5|$|Due to {{its origins}} as an {{engineering}} school, the West Point curriculum emphasised mathematics and other technical subjects of <b>relevance</b> <b>to</b> that speciality rather than education in military topics. Much {{of the military}} training that was conducted concerned close order drill and equitation. Of the top 25 graduates {{of the class of}} 1915, 24 were commissioned into the Corps of Engineers. The exception, James A. Lester, who was ranked 23rd in the class, chose to go into the field artillery instead. He would also become major general.|$|E

40|$|We present AUDENS, a new platform-independent {{open source}} tool for {{automated}} de novo sequencing of peptides from MS/MS data. We implemented a dynamic programming algorithm and combined {{it with a}} flexible preprocessing module {{which is designed to}} distinguish between signal and other peaks. By applying a user-defined set of heuristics, AUDENS screens through the spectrum and assigns high <b>relevance</b> values <b>to</b> putative signal peaks. The algorithm constructs a sequence path through the MS/ MS spectrum using the peak <b>relevances</b> <b>to</b> score each suggested sequence path, i. e., the corresponding amino acid sequence. At present, we consider AUDENS a prototype that unfolds its biggest potential if used in parallel with other de novo sequencing tools.

5|$|Feminist {{economics}} {{is the critical}} study of economics including its methodology, epistemology, history and empirical research, attempting to overcome androcentric (male and patriarchal) biases. It focuses on topics of particular <b>relevance</b> <b>to</b> women, such as care work or occupational segregation (exclusion of women and minorities from certain fields); deficiencies of economic models, such as disregarding intra-household bargaining; new forms of data collection and measurement such as the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and more gender-aware theories such as the capabilities approach. Feminist economics ultimately seeks to produce a more gender inclusive economics.|$|E
5|$|The key {{difference}} between QA technology and document search is that document search takes a keyword query and returns {{a list of}} documents, ranked in order of <b>relevance</b> <b>to</b> the query (often based on popularity and page ranking), while QA technology takes a question expressed in natural language, seeks to understand it in much greater detail, and returns a precise answer to the question.|$|E
5|$|After Drishyam Telugu remake was confirmed, Haasan called Venkatesh to {{tell him}} that he was happy that Venkatesh was going to reprise Mohanlal's role from the original. After {{considering}} other potential titles, Drushyam was finalised because of its <b>relevance</b> <b>to</b> the film's storyline. 'Darling' Swami and the Paruchuri brothers wrote the dialogues. The film had its formal launch ceremony on 21 February 2014 in Hyderabad. Sharreth composed the music. S. Gopal Reddy took charge of the film's cinematography and Marthand K. Venkatesh its editing. With this film, Suresh Productions completed its golden jubilee in Telugu cinema as a production and distribution company.|$|E

5|$|Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, {{several of}} which are toxic to animals or plants and are {{therefore}} called mycotoxins. Of particular <b>relevance</b> <b>to</b> humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and ergot alkaloids, which {{have a long history}} of causing serious epidemics of ergotism (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye or related cereals contaminated with sclerotia of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are insidious liver toxins and highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by certain Aspergillus species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, patulin, and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 mycotoxin) and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{classification}} {{systems of}} the 17th and 18th centuries now related plants {{to one another and}} not to man, marking a return to the non-anthropocentric botanical science promoted by Theophrastus over 1500 years before. In England, various herbals in either Latin or English were mainly compilations and translations of continental European works, of limited <b>relevance</b> <b>to</b> the British Isles. This included the rather unreliable work of Gerard (1597). The first systematic attempt to collect information on British plants was that of Thomas Johnson (1629), who was later to issue his own revision of Gerard's work (1633–1636).|$|E
5|$|The {{account of}} Southchurch's {{provisioning}} was first {{made available to}} a wider audience through {{the writings of the}} English historian Helen Cam. Cam was responsible for groundbreaking work on the Hundred Rolls, and their <b>relevance</b> <b>to</b> English local government, through her Studies in the Hundred Rolls (1921) and The Hundred and the Hundred Rolls (1930). In both of these she made mention of what she calls '...the most picturesque series of extortions recorded in the Essex returns.' It was, however, in a paper published in the English Historical Review as early as 1916 that she gave the most detailed account of Southchurch's plot. Here she traced the dissemination of the Viking legend through Geoffrey of Monmouth, and speculated that Southchurch could have been acquainted with a later version by Gaimar, Wace or Layamon, or through a local, popular legend.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} Siddharth {{was because of}} the sheer <b>relevance</b> <b>to</b> the {{character}} in real life. However, they finalized the choice of the actor only after the script was ready. The choice of Genelia was based on her natural vivacity in real life. This and her eyes, according to Bhaskar, made her an obvious choice for her character. More so, she liked the one line story that Raju told and also a few scenes that he narrated to her. She immediately liked the character and consented for the role. The fact that her co-actor, Siddharth and she acted earlier together in Boys (2003), made them more comfortable to work with. The camaraderie that the lead actors shared during the filming, added to their good performances. The choice of Prakash Raj was easy as he befitted the character he portrayed while, Jayasudha was persuaded {{to play the role of}} the lead actor's mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversial}} {{question of}} whether to add additional slave states to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration {{took place during the}} Missouri controversy of 1819 to 1821. Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that the Founding Fathers of the United States had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave states should not be added to the country. Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina argued that the Declaration was {{not a part of the}} Constitution and therefore had no <b>relevance</b> <b>to</b> the question.|$|E
5|$|The {{irreducible}} infinite-dimensional unitary representations {{may have}} indirect <b>relevance</b> <b>to</b> physical reality in speculative modern theories since the (generalized) Lorentz group appears {{as the little}} group of the Poincare group of spacelike vectors in higher spacetime dimension. The corresponding infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the (generalized) Poincaré group are the so-called tachyonic representations. Tachyons appear in the spectrum of bosonic strings and are associated with instability of the vacuum. Even though tachyons may not be realized in nature, these representations must be mathematically understood {{in order to understand}} string theory. This is so since tachyon states turn out to appear in superstring theories too in attempts to create realistic models.|$|E

5|$|The {{plaintiff}} in Lines International {{argued that the}} guidelines adopted by the multi-agency committee {{set up by the}} PSA, STPB and GSB were invalid as the committee had no existence at law. The High Court held that there was nothing unlawful or even intrinsically wrong with these government agencies setting up such a committee to discuss matters of <b>relevance</b> <b>to</b> their respective jurisdictions as long as each agency made its own decisions within the ambit of its own statutory powers. The notion that such a committee fettered PSA's discretion was dismissed by a further finding of fact that the ad-hoc committee had not acted as an entity in itself. Enforcement and appropriate action were left to the agencies. A meeting attended by the plaintiff's representatives at which the guidelines relating to cruises-to-nowhere were announced was facilitated by a moderator rather than a chairperson, and each of the agencies read out guidelines which they themselves would be adopting and implementing.|$|E

In 1971 he became chair of the Public Works Committee's Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds, then by 1973 he was chair of its Subcommittee on Water Resources, then later its Subcommittee on Environmental Pollution. Gravel was also initially named to the Joint Committee on Congressional Operations. By 1973 Gravel was off the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and the Select Small Business Committee and instead a member of the Finance Committee, and by 1977 was chair of that body's Subcommittee on Energy and Foundations. By 1973 he had also been on the ad hoc Special Committee to Study Secret and Confidential Government Documents.|$|E
