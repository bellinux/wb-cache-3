Special Rapporteur in charge of {{preparation}} of a comprehensive Study on Conditions of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in all member countries of the United Nations.7 The U.N. published this global study in 1974 in all its official languages.8 In 1973 and 1976, Ganji was elected by the UN Commission on Human Rights to serve, in his personal capacity, as a Member of the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities (each time for a 3 years term). In 1976 he was also elected by the Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to serve a three years term in his personal capacity as a Member of the Committee on Human Rights, responsible for overseeing {{the implementation of the}} Covenant. To save his life, Ganji hid in Iran and six months after the 1979 revolution escaped Iran on foot into Turkey and from there to the United States. Ganji is the founder and Secretary General of the 'Derafsh Kaviani' (the Flag of Freedom Organization of Iran [...] "FFO"), a democratic non-violent opposition movement to the clerical regime. He is also founder and Secretary General of the Organization for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms for Iran whose aims and purposes are educating the Iranian people about their rights and freedoms, demanding their respect by the authorities, and through civil disobedience striving towards the establishment of a free and pluralistic society respectful of human rights,the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-discrimination,</b> {{separation of church and state}} and a parliamentary democracy in Iran.9 ...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} {{discrimination}} {{between women and}} men in the workplace, in order to open up equality of opportunity in employment, is a measure of social policy regarded as desirable by makers of law and policy in Western liberal democracies, including the four legal systems examined in the present study. Legislative provisions with the specific purpose of removal of sex discrimination in employment have been in place in those legal systems for a number of years: since the 1960 s, {{in the case of the}} United States of America (Civil Rights Act 1964), since the 1970 s, in the case of the United Kingdom (Equal Pay Act 1970), since the 1980 s, in the case of the Federal Republic of Germany (EG-Anpassungsgesetz 1980) and, in the case of the European Community, since its foundation in 1957 (Treaty of Rome, Article 119). Now that comprehensive legislation with the purpose of removal of sex discrimination in employment is in place, in the four legal systems examined, attention should be focused on the effectiveness of the legislation and on proposals for its continued improvement. The effectiveness of a particular aspect of the general legislative provisions concerning sex discrimination in employment is the focus of the present study. The issue with which the study is concerned is that of exceptions to the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-discrimination,</b> or 'justifications' for discriminatory behaviour in the employment sphere. It is common ground that any statement of general principle (including the principle of nondiscrimination on grounds of sex) will be subject to exceptions. The exceptions form the subject of the present study. Exceptions to a general principle should be applied in such a way as to avoid undermining the core principle. The study seeks to explore qualifications to the general principle of non-discrimination in employment, and to refine those qualifications, so as to protect the application of the general principle...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{globalization}} and world trade liberalization has been vigorously debated {{over the past few}} years, culminating in the WTO-riots in Seattle 1999. Since then, various NGOs have claimed that WTO and its regulatory framework; GATT, is not a sincere attempt to bring prosperity to all members of WTO, i. e. including those in the third world. In contrast, the NGOs claims that WTO is just another “rich mans club” with the one and only intention to further exploit the weakest countries for the sake of expanding economical profits. It is undisputed that the foundation and cornerstone of GATT/WTO, i. e. the MFN-principle is a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-discrimination</b> and justice; however, it is important to gain knowledge of how the MFN-principle is applied by the competent authorities within the WTO system to secure a fair and just view of the underlying intentions of the WTO. The rule of thumb saying that “the exception defines the rule” is striking concerning this matter, especially since the exception (Article XXIV GATT 1994) in this case has been used and abused over and over again, to the degree that the rule, i. e. MFN, runs the risk of being diluted {{to the point where it}} no longer qualifies as a general rule. This thesis treats the main exception from the rule of MFN, i. e. Article XXIV GATT 1994 because this is the exception that defines the MFN-principle and as such being extremely important. This thesis covers the legal as well as the political and economical aspects of the XXIV dilemma. The purpose is to reveal the forces that have an impact on this subject, be it the lobbyists acting in Washington or Geneva, the rapidly changing global trade flows, economical incitements or the Appellate Body decisions regarding this matter. The main focus will however be on the legal aspects, including the ever so important issue of drafting history to render possible a deep understanding of this dilemma. This thesis is supposed to cover all the vital areas concerning Article XXIV, so as to provide an overall understanding of the subject, however without neglecting the highly important deep penetration of the legal aspects of the problem. The reason for an overall approach is that the subject matter is extremely complex, especially the legal aspects, and that this thesis may fill a void, i. e. to provide the reader with an easy to grasp, but nevertheless deep, understanding of the XXIV dilemma...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the substance of the}} WTO panel decision for Canada-Wheat as it relates to trade friction in North American agricultural markets. I provide an overview of recent economic literature on state trading enterprises (STEs) and examine the WTO’s approach to regulating the behaviour of STEs. The Canada-Wheat panel was the first WTO panel to consider Canada’s single-desk marketing system for Western Canadian wheat and barley and was the first test of the WTO’s regulation of STEs under GATT Article XVII. The panel rejected the American argument, opting for a line of reasoning that highlights the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-discrimination</b> while maintaining some of the ambiguity of Article XVII. I conclude by examining the competitive pressures that exacerbate trade frictions between North American wheat producers. From a legal perspective, this panel decision is significant because it clarifies the WTO’s position on STEs, to a certain extent. In the context of continental politics, however, the ruling will likely have little impact on Canada/U. S. trade relations because it must be analyzed in relation to the domestic demands that arise from ongoing structural adjustment in both nations’ agricultural sectors. agricultural exports, Canadian Wheat Board, dispute settlement, state trading enterprises, World Trade Organization, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Crop Production/Industries, International Relations/Trade, Political Economy,...|$|R

The public administration's mission is to provide better information to citizens, ensure transparency in administrative documents as well as to strengthen and extent the participation of civil society in decision making. Good governance requires respecting the principles of a good administration: the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, <b>non-discrimination,</b> equal treatment, proportionality, consistency, objectivity and impartiality. The minimal respect of all of these will ensure quality public services, better information and involvement in the European community (Code of Good Administrative Behavior, Relations with the Public) ...|$|R

40|$|Trade {{negotiations}} occur {{through time}} {{and between the}} governments of many countries. An important issue is thus whether the value of concessions that a government wins in a current negotiation may be eroded in a future bilateral negotiation {{to which it is}} not party. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> that govern the bilateral negotiation, we first show that the potential for opportunistic bilateral agreements is indeed severe. We next identify <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> negotiation that serve to protect the welfare of governments that are not participating in the bilateral negotiation. The reciprocal market access' rule ensures that the market access of a non-participating country is unaltered, and we show that this rule eliminates the potential for opportunistic bilateral negotiations. This rule, however, has practical limitations, and so we next consider the negotiation rules that are prominent in GATT practice and discussion. Our main finding is that the two central <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> GATT [...] <b>non-discrimination</b> (MFN) and reciprocity [...] effectively mimic the reciprocal market access rule, and therefore offer a practical means through which to protect non-participant welfare and thereby eliminate the potential for opportunistic bilateral negotiations. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>non-discrimination</b> {{constitutes a}} corner-stone in different fields of international economic law, notably {{international trade in}} goods and services as well as intellectual property and investment protection. While its basic rationale appears to be straightforward, {{the application of the}} different legal elements which constitute a non-discrimination obligation has proven to be most challenging. Adjudicating bodies have been applying different interpretations and standards with regard to the legal elements of ‘less favourable treatment', ‘likeness' and ‘regulatory purpose', which leads to a high fragmentation <b>of</b> the <b>non-discrimination</b> principle in international economic law. This article maps out the different theories for each of these elements on the examples of WTO law, NAFTA, bilateral investment treaties (BIT) and EU law and analyses how these theories affect the scope and liberalizing effect <b>of</b> the <b>non-discrimination</b> obligation. The article then attempts to develop a coherent factor-based application <b>of</b> <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>rules</b> suitable for all fields of international economic law.

40|$|In 2011, {{the heads}} of state of the {{countries}} comprising the Southern African Development Community (SADC) decided to dissolve the SADC Tribunal, a regional court modelled on the European Court of Justice. Four years earlier, the tribunal had ruled that the Zimbabwe government’s expropriations of land owned by white farmers violated the SADC Treaty principles on the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>non-discrimination.</b> The tribunal ordered the government to refrain from interfering with the farmers’ occupation and ownership of their properties. The government ignored the court’s decisions and embarked on a campaign to smash the tribunal and nullify its rulings. The SADC Summit was thus confronted with the choice of backing either the Zimbabwe government or the tribunal. By abandoning the court in favour of Harare, it elevated the norms of solidarity and regime protection above the democratic and legal principles espoused in the treaty. The head of the tribunal, Judge Ariranga Pillay, denounced the summit’s decision as ‘worthy of potentates and kings who can do no wrong and who are not accountable for their actions’ (Christie 2011 a).
