50|$|The Navy {{committed}} to the $15 billion (2003) program in advance of rigorous analysis or clearly defined purpose, appearance, or survivability. Proponents typically pointed to its speed, asymmetric littoral threats, and impact on the American shipbuilding industry. The LCS suffered from <b>requirements</b> <b>creep,</b> adding more missions and equipment, potentially rendering it too complex and expensive to use. When it was decided the ship would not be expendable, the original concept of a small, cheap, simple coastal warship became bigger, more expensive, and more complicated; with a smaller crew due to automation. The task force assigned six different missions which had been previously performed by individual ships: submarine and mine hunting; combating small boats; intelligence gathering; transporting special forces; and counter-drug and piracy patrols. Each ship would be big enough to sail across the Pacific alone, embark a helicopter, have a minimum 40 knot top speed, and cost $220 million. The Navy was only willing to build one type of ship, the task force, realized it was virtually impossible for one vessel to fill all roles, advocated a large hull to cover the mission range through modularity, organic combat power, and unmanned systems. Empty space was left for weapon and sensor mission modules costing $150 million. When the first production contracts were awarded in 2004, no mission module worked outside of a laboratory. Fast, cheap construction was emphasized, solving problems with technology.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Although {{requirement}} {{evolution is}} a widely recognized phenomenon, {{there are only a}} few approaches for measuring it. These existing approaches are based on the assumption that all the requirements exist and can be seen in the requirement elicitation and analysis phases. They do not include provisions for the emergence during systems development of new requirements, which cannot be anticipated in the requirement elicitation and analysis phase. This paper shows how the concept of <b>requirements</b> <b>creep</b> is adopted for the measurement of emergent requirement evolution. We use a case study in the E-commerce domain to illustrate the use of this measure in the prediction of systems development. The findings of this study suggest that requirement evolution can be measured in a practical software project, and the findings demonstrate the strong influence of <b>requirements</b> <b>creep</b> on the systems development effort.

The market for such data products is well served and likely to become more competitive with further very-high-resolution missions. Whereas commercial markets have concentrated on enhancing resolution, the small satellite sector has concentrated on reducing the cost of data products, {{and the development of}} systems providing niche services. One such area that can be well served by smaller satellites is the need for higher temporal resolution, as this typically requires a large number of satellites to operate as a constellation. Surrey is currently engaged in building its first constellation providing daily global coverage at moderate resolution in three spectral bands. Targeted at providing timely quick-look data products for disaster mitigation and monitoring, the constellation comprises 5 satellites in a single orbital plane. Each satellite has a wide swath so that successive satellites progressively cover the entire globe in a single day. The Vista constellation takes this concept a step further, and is proposed for applications requiring near-continuous surveillance of regional activity. By introducing a multiple plane constellation of small Earth Observation satellites, it is possible to monitor the entire globe continuously. The paper describes the system trades and outlines the scope of the performance that could be obtained from such a system. A cost model illustrates that the balance between launch and space segment costs must be reached by considering suitable replacement strategies, and that the system is highly sensitive to <b>requirement</b> <b>creep.</b> Finally, it is shown that the use of cost effective, small satellites leads to solutions previously thought to be out of reach of government customers...|$|R

This unexpected loss of ductility is called as rupture ductility trough, and this study covers the attempts to investigate the dependency of creep rupture ductility of 1. 25 Cr- 0. 5 Mo steel on microstructure and stress, in the temperature range of 773 - 923 K. An empirical relationship in exponential character was developed to predict the rupture time leading to rupture ductility trough, depending on temperature and the initial structure of steel.

Chandra experienced many of challenges facing bold space programs (state-of-the-art technical requirements and budget-induced slips and restructurings), and yet the Chandra team achieved nearly all the originally envisioned performance for dramatically lower cost. This was accomplished by a combination of team- work, systems engineering, advanced technology insertion, and effective approaches for program implementation. A thorough tradeoff of science utility vs. cost led to the selection of a highly elliptical orbit with uncrewed robotic delivery, deployment, and maintenance.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{software}} projects have encountered major difficulties. Most software engineering projects tend to be late and over budget. Several {{of the causes of}} these failures are related to requirements engineering issues such as <b>requirements</b> <b>creep,</b> poorly documented requirements, requirements that were impossible to satisfy, and requirements that failed {{to meet the needs of}} the user. Good requirements management practices help improve customer satisfaction, lower the system development costs, and increase the chance of having successful project which in turn give rise to security issue or vulnerable to hackers.

In this paper requirements metrics define the output measures of the software process to security of the system. Some recent reports indicate that the project success rate has slightly increased over the last years. This success is a result of defining a process and use of tools like requirements management tools. There are several requirements management tools available in the market.

40|$|High {{temperature}} creep {{is often}} dealt with simplified models {{to assess and}} predict the future behavior of materials and components. Also, for most applications the creep properties of interest require costly long-term testing that limits the available data to support design and life assessment. Such test data sets are even smaller for welded joints that are often the weakest links of structures. It is of considerable interest {{to be able to}} reliably predict and extrapolate long term creep behavior from relatively small sets of supporting creep data. For creep strain, the current tools for model verification and quality assurance are very limited. The ECCC PATs can be adapted to some degree but the uncertainty and applicability of many models are still questionable outside the range of data. In this thesis tools for improving the model robustness have been developed. The toolkit includes creep rupture, weld strength and creep strain modeling improvements for uniaxial prediction. The applicability is shown on data set consisting of a selection of common high temperature steels and the oxygen-free phosphorous doped (OFP) copper. The steels assessed are 10 CrMo 9 - 10 (P 22), 7 CrWVMoNb 9 - 6 (P 23), 7 CrMoVTiB 10 - 10 (P 24), 14 MoV 6 - 3 (0. 5 CMV), X 20 CrMoV 11 - 1 (X 20), X 10 CrMoVNb 9 - 1 (P 91) and X 11 CrMoWVNb 9 - 1 - 1 (E 911). The work described in this thesis has provided simple yet well performing tools to predict creep strain and life for material evaluation, component design and life assessment purposes. The uncertainty related to selecting the type of material model or determining weld strength factors has been reduced by the selection procedures and by linking the weld behavior to the base material master equation. Much of the resulting improvements and benefits are related to the reduced <b>requirements</b> for supporting <b>creep</b> data. The simplicity and robustness of the new tools also makes them easy to implement for both analytical and numerical solutions...|$|R
40|$|Whereas {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been reported on the quantitative estimation of the microstructure of steels {{as a function of}} most of the important determining variables, it remains the case {{that it is impossible to}} calculate all but the simplest of mechanical properties given a comprehensive description of the structure at all conceivable scales. Properties which are important but fall into this category are impact toughness, fatigue, creep and combinations of these phenomena. The work presented in this thesis is an attempt to progress in this area of complex mechanical properties in the context of steels, although the outcomes may be more widely applied. The approach used relies on the creation of physically meaningful models based on the neural network and genetic programming techniques. It appears that the hot–strength, of ferritic steels used in the power plant industry, diminishes in concert with the dependence of solid solution strengthening on temperature, until a critical temperature is reached where it is believed that climb processes begin to contribute. It is demonstrated that in this latter regime, the slope of the hot–strength versus temperature plot is identical to that of creep rupture–strength versus temperature. This significant outcome can help dramatically reduce the <b>requirement</b> for expensive <b>creep</b> testing. Similarly, a model created to estimate the fatigue crack growth rates for a wide range of ferritic and austenitic steels on the basis of static mechanical data has the remarkable outcome that it applies without modification to nickel based superalloys and titanium alloys. It has therefore been possible to estimate blindly the fatigue performance of alloys whose chemical composition is not known. Residual stress is a very complex phenomenon especially in bearings due to the Hertzian contact which takes place. A model has been developed that is able to quantify the residual stress distribution, under the raceway of martensitic ball bearings, using the running conditions. It is evident that a well–formulated neural network model can not only be extrapolated even beyond material type, but can reveal physical relationships which are found to be informative and useful in practice...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} and comprehensive {{research and development}} methodology is being prescribed to produce Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) -Fe{sub 3 }Al thin walled tubes, using powder extrusion methodologies, for eventual use at operating temperatures of up to 1100 % in the power generation industry. A particular ''in service application'' anomaly of Fe{sub 3 }Al-based alloys is that the environmental resistance is maintained up to 1200 C, well beyond where such alloys retain sufficient mechanical strength. Grain boundary creep processes at such high temperatures are anticipated to be the dominant failure mechanism. Thus, the challenges of this program are manifold: (1) to produce thin walled ODS-Fe{sub 3 }Al tubes, employing powder extrusion methodologies, with (2) adequate increased strength for service at operating temperatures, and (3) to mitigate creep failures by enhancing the as-processed grain size in ODS-Fe{sub 3 }Al tubes. Our research progress till date {{has resulted in the}} successful batch production of typically 8 Ft. lengths of 1 - 3 / 8 inch diameter, 1 / 8 inch wall thickness, ODS-Fe{sub 3 }Al tubes via a proprietary single step extrusion consolidation process. The process parameters for such consolidation methodologies have been prescribed and evaluated as being routinely reproducible. Such processing parameters (i. e., extrusion ratios, temperature, can design etc.) were particularly guided by the need to effect post-extrusion recrystallization and grain growth at a sufficiently low temperature, while still meeting the <b>creep</b> <b>requirement</b> at service temperatures. Static recrystallization studies show that elongated grains (with their long axis parallel to the extrusion axis), typically 200 - 2000 {micro}m in diameter, and several millimeters long can be obtained routinely, at 1200 C. The growth kinetics are affected by the interstitial impurity content in the powder batches. For example complete recrystallization, across the tube wall thickness, is observed for clean powders (PMWY- 3) and consequently this powder batch exhibits the best creep performance. Prolonged exposures (about 700 hours) at 10 Ksi at 1000 C have been achieved till date. The high impurity content powder batches (PMWY- 1 and PMWY- 2) exhibit modest improvements in tensile and creep response behavior at 1000 C upon further selective heat-treatments intended to increase grain size...|$|R
40|$|Increases in NASA {{mission costs}} are well-noted but not well-understood, {{and there is}} little {{evidence}} that they are decreasing in frequency or amount over time. The need to control spending has led to analysis of the causes and magnitude of historical mission overruns, and many program control efforts are being implemented to attempt to prevent or mitigate the problem (NPR 7120). However, cost overruns have not abated, and while some direct causes of increased spending may be obvious (<b>requirements</b> <b>creep,</b> launch delays, directed changes, etc.), the underlying impetus to spend past the original budget may be more subtle. Gaining better insight into the causes of cost overruns will help NASA and its contracting organizations to avoid. them. This paper hypothesizes that one cause of NASA mission cost overruns is that the availability of reserves gives project team members an incentive to make decisions and behave in ways that increase costs. We theorize that the presence of reserves is a contributing factor to cost overruns because it causes organizations to use their funds less efficiently or to control spending less effectively. We draw a comparison to the insurance industry concept of moral hazard, the phenomenon that the presence of insurance causes insureds to have more frequent and higher insurance losses, and we attempt to apply actuarial techniques to quantifY the increase in the expected cost of a mission due to the availability of reserves. We create a theoretical model of reserve spending motivation by defining a variable ReserveSpending as a function of total reserves. This function has a positive slope; for every dollar of reserves available, there is a positive probability of spending it. Finally, the function should be concave down; the probability of spending each incremental dollar of reserves decreases progressively. We test the model against available NASA CADRe data by examining missions with reserve dollars initially available and testing whether they are more likely to spend those dollars, and whether larger levels of reserves lead to higher cost overruns. Finally, we address the question of how to prevent reserves from increasing mission spending without increasing cost risk to projects budgeted without any reserves. Is there a "sweet spot"? How can we derive the maximum benefit associated with risk reduction from reserves while minimizing the effects of reserve spending motivation...|$|E

The goal of this research is to better understand the organizational processes and problems associated with software requirements management within NASA's human-rated space programs through interviews with experienced professionals within this organization. Some of the major themes that resulted from the expert interviews include: * Software engineering practices, such as the CMM, are starting to be implemented for the larger programs at NASA, however these practices have not been equally pervasive {{in all parts of the}} organization. * The main reason for lack of requirements management at NASA is not enough time or people available for the activity. * The reason that was most cited for requirements management tools not being used effectively is that these tools are too manpower intensive for NASA's current organizational situation, and require documentation that is not available. * To achieve improvements in requirements management NASA should hire more people with computer science backgrounds who also have an understanding of aerospace systems. * The lack of complete documentation on NASA projects, means that complete system testing cannot happen. * <b>Requirements</b> <b>creep</b> can happen at NASA because higher level customers do not always have a complete technical understanding of a subsystem or component that is(cont.) being developed, and the designers may interpret or change a requirement without consulting the customer. * NASA often deals with managing relationships between different subcontractors who have responsibility for different parts of the software lifecycle, and each subcontractor has its' own interests and stake in the final outcome of the system. It is important that NASA adequately manages the requirements between these parties to ensure that the customer's system requirements do not become distorted by the political interests of the subcontractors.

The reason for this is the large number of software projects in the past that failed to deliver useful products within budget, and struggled with changing <b>requirements</b> and scope <b>creep.</b> Meanwhile it is a common sense understanding that not all projects are predictable from the beginning. Market uncertainty and a fast changing business environment drives changes during the development of a software product. One of the key characteristics of any agile approach is its explicit focus on Business Value. Although any software development method aims at creating a product and thus creating value, in agile software projects the value creation for the clients represents the essence and defines the focus of the process. Thus, the agile development process is a value creation process. The agile methods allow for frequent decisions about the requirements that will be considered for implementation during the short development cycles called iterations. In practice this decision-making is implemented by the process of requirements prioritization and re-prioritization, performed at the beginning of each iteration. This work is dedicated to exploring and understanding the process of value-creation for clients in agile projects, with a particular focus on the requirements prioritization and reprioritization during a project, as an agile-specific value creation practice. We performed a number of research steps to explore some of the current agile practices that seem to contribute to the value creation, and thus to distil knowledge that the agile practitioners apply and that might help to improve the agile practice. Further, we studied in detail the agile prioritization process and identified the criteria, used in the decision-making process, and relations between the project context and the instantiation of the process. In particular, we researched the following topics: • How is business value perceived and measured in agile projects? • What practices contribute to value creation in agile projects in different contexts? • What concepts play a role in making re-prioritization decisions about requirements? These questions represent the focus of our research activities. They lead and framed the formulation of our Research Questions and the research design. The main contribution of our work to the research and practitioners’ communities consists in the rich contextual description of the process of requirements prioritization in agile projects as well as a conceptual model of this process...|$|R
