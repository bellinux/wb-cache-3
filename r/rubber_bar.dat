50|$|A 2009 study {{looked at}} using {{eccentric}} exercise with a <b>rubber</b> <b>bar</b> {{in addition to}} standard treatment: the trial was stopped after 8 weeks because the improvement using the bar for therapy was so significant. Based on small sample size and a follow-up only 7 weeks from commencement of treatment, the study shows short-term improvements. This along with other studies allowed doctors to conclude that approximately 80-95% of all tennis elbow cases can be treated without surgery.

40|$|One of new {{innovation}} in modified concrete is foamed concrete containing rubber bars. The function of rubber on foamed concrete {{is to improve}} the strength and enhance the resistance toward high strain rate loadings. The production of foamed concrete containing rubber bars, therefore, leads to the heterogeneous material condition or so-called composite. Mostly, the investigations of strength and material properties of modified concrete are conducted using experimental approaches with various parametric and proportions. This study, however, intends to numerically analyse the strength and elastic properties of foamed concrete containing rubber bars through multi-scale simulation. The unit cell consists of foamed concrete and <b>rubber</b> <b>bar</b> was modelled using the hybrid finite-discrete element method. The damage model of rotating crack was defined on foamed concrete, while <b>rubber</b> <b>bar</b> remain as elastic. It was revealed that foamed concrete containing 5 mm diameter of rubber bars with proportion below that 3 % produces optimum strength. Results that obtained from multi-scale simulation show a favourable agreement with that obtained from experimental study and rule of mixtures...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{sliding force}} {{arising from the}} closed chain {{mechanism}} among the adhering points of a climbing caterpillar robot (CCR), a sliding phenomenon will happen at the adhering points, e. g., the vacuum pads or claws holding the surface. This sliding force makes the attachment of the climbing robot unsteady and reducesthe motion efficiency. According to the new bionic research on the soft-body structure of caterpillars, some flexible structures made of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>bars</b> are applied in CCRs correspondingly as an improvement to the old rigid mechanical design of the robotic structure. This paper firstly establishes the static model of the sliding forces, the distortion of flexible bars and the driving torques of joints. Then, a method to reduce the sliding force by exerting a compensating angle to an active joint of the CCR is presented. The analyses and experimental {{results indicate that the}} flexible structure and the compensating angle method can reduce the sliding forces remarkably...|$|R

The headrace channel lies on the right bank of the stream and it has 4.4m inner width and 2.2m of wall height while the design flow is 27m3/s. This bank has moderately steep slopes, and the bedrock is marginally weathered.

Prior to treatment, neutralization of wastewater in advance using 0. 1 N NaOH to obtain a pH neutral in wastewater. The function of neutralization is to optimize the performance of the coagulation process. wastewater which has been neutralized then carried coagulation-flocculation process using a coagulant PAC with a concentration of 100 ppm. Coagulation process is done by varying the stirring speed of 100 rpm, 200 rpm and 300 rpm for 5 minutes and continued with the process of flocculation with a stirring speed of 60 rpm for 10 minutes. Wastewater then allowed to sedimentation for 30 minutes to precipitate the floc-floc had formed. Then the wastewater is separated from the sediment / floc using filter paper. The result showed that the maximum stirring speed in the coagulation process to reduce pollutant load in wastewater rubber is 200 rpm. Wastewater has been coagulated with stirring speed of 200 rpm and then fed into the ultrafiltration membranes with a variation of pressure of 1 bar, 2 bar and 3 bar. The maximum operating pressure ultrafiltration membranes to reduce the pollutant load in wastewater <b>rubber</b> is 3 <b>bar.</b> A combination of coagulation and ultrafiltration membrane able to reduce pollutant load in wastewater rubber with a value of BOD decline is 84. 11 %, COD is 84. 17 %, TSS is 95. 40 % and ammonia is 51. 19 %...|$|R
