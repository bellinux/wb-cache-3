5|$|John Palliser {{crossed the}} Rockies through a pass in 1858 {{that led to}} the {{headwaters}} of the Palliser River, a tributary of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party referred to it as Palliser's River.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake, but had some trouble making their way back to Alberta; the <b>return</b> <b>route</b> that they had chosen proved too dangerous to negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, they made it back over the Rockies later that year through North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up the Elk River.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish started trans-Pacific voyages between New Spain (Mexico {{and present}} U.S. California) and the Philippines in 1565. The famous Manila galleons carried silver from Mexican mines westward to the entrepôt of Manila in the Spanish {{possession}} of the Philippines. There, the silver was used to purchase spices and trade goods gathered from throughout Asia, including (until 1638) goods from Japan. The <b>return</b> <b>route</b> of the Manila galleons, first charted by the Spanish navigator Andrés de Urdaneta, took the ships northeast into the Kuroshio Current (also known as the Japan Current) {{off the coast of}} Japan, and then across the Pacific to the west coast of Mexico, landing eventually in Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|However, the Germans {{were now}} {{trapped in the}} {{interior}} of Gaul, as their <b>return</b> <b>route</b> to the Rhine was barred by the Roman armies. In Julian's sector, the Caesar despatched squadrons of cavalry to lie in ambush on three roads and these successfully intercepted and destroyed the returning barbarian bands. But in Barbatio's sector, the main body of Germans were allowed to pass unmolested: Barbatio's chief-of-staff Cella rejected the urgent plea of two of his cavalry tribuni (regimental commanders) Valentinianus (later emperor Valentinian I ruled 364-75) and Bainobaudes to deploy their squadrons on a highway that they expected the enemy would use. The escaping force reached some islands in the Rhine near Strasbourg where the raiding-bands had moved their camps for safety in response to the Roman pincer movement. Nevertheless, Julian pursued them vigorously. Although without boats, his men succeeded in reaching one island, as the river had become fordable at some points due to summer drought. An entire raiding-band was surprised and slaughtered, a success repeated on a few other islands. In response, the Germans evacuated the remaining islands, removing their sutlers, baggage and booty {{to the far side of}} the Rhine.|$|E

5|$|Seeing {{that their}} {{fortunes}} were dwindling, Ferdinand's rivals tried {{to settle for}} peace with Francisco Sforza. Ferdinand sent Skanderbeg as an intermediary where Giovanni Orsini and Piccinino offered peace if paid 150,000 and 110,000 ducats respectively, something that Ferdinand refused. This was one of Skanderbeg's last personal actions in Italy. He stayed in Apulia for another month until January 1462 {{when he returned to}} Albania, leaving his soldiers in Italy. His reason for leaving Italy is not clear, but it is believed that at that time Mehmed was preparing his campaign against Hungary, something which could be turned against Albania. On his <b>return</b> <b>route,</b> he again visited Ragusa, where he was likewise welcomed as a hero. He wanted to set off for Albania immediately, but bad weather forced him to stay. He was offered supplies by the Ragusan Rectors, suggesting that he wished to continue to Albania via land, but instead, after ten days in Ragusa, he sailed by ship to Albania. Before leaving, he purchased grain from Sicily for his soldiers in Apulia.|$|E

Another group of 12 fighters patrolled along the <b>return</b> <b>route.</b> The first attack unit of eight IL-2's, protected by eight fighters, attacked the German airplanes {{on the ground in}} a 1300-meter dive. This was followed by the main force of IL-2 bombers, arriving in groups of four.|$|E
30|$|When the node {{decides that}} it should return the QR message based on the above two conditions, the road {{segments}} marked in the received TC message are used to form the <b>returning</b> <b>route</b> to the source node. Most forward routing similar to the query dissemination is used except that intermediate nodes not on road segments in the <b>returning</b> <b>route</b> {{do not participate in}} the routing. Note that the source node can receive multiple QR messages for each query it has initiated because the query traverses multiple routes to the destination. For each QR message received, the source node will obtain road traffic information on more target road segments. We will show later in the simulation that the source node may terminate the query session either after a few seconds or around ten or more QR messages have been received.|$|R

25|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} the Philippines was ordered by Philip II of Spain, and Andrés de Urdaneta was the {{designated}} commander. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to command and Miguel López de Legazpi was appointed instead. The expedition set sail on November 1564. After spending some time on the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back {{to find a better}} <b>return</b> <b>route.</b> Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of Cebu on June 1, 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as 38 degrees North latitude to obtain favourable winds.|$|E
25|$|They {{successfully}} {{raided the}} village and managed to capture a large quantity of rice. Not being content with this, they wasted time plundering {{the village and}} setting fire to the temples and houses. This provided the Kandyans, numbering some 7000, {{with an opportunity to}} set up an ambush, cutting down trees to block the <b>return</b> <b>route.</b> The Portuguese, already exhausted by days of fighting, were forced to fight for each step along rough paths through thick forests. One by one they fell. Captain Álvaro de Souza and few Lascarins managed to escape and brought the news of the defeat to the Portuguese camp.|$|E
30|$|The {{simplest}} {{methods are}} based on the direct measurements of the horizontal rise of arc and determining the geometric layout, created from the curvature graph. However, this procedure is performed on the local reference system with transformation, which can lead to serious errors. The most common mistakes are connected with the inaccurate definition of the <b>returning</b> <b>route</b> angle. As a result, during the track lining some unintentional curvature smoothing might occur.|$|R
40|$|Generally, {{driving a}} {{personal}} car {{to access the}} public transport network should not be actively encouraged due to impact on traffic movement slowly. However {{many parts of the}} state lie within rural areas where public transport, no matter how much improved, is unlikely to be attractive enough to persuade the majority such car users to adopt use of public transport services. Park and Ride (P&R) were seen as a cheaper alternative to encourage people out of their cars and onto buses and a generally more environmentally acceptable policy. Penang State Government has committed significant money to implement the P&R program on the shuttle bus services start from March, 2011 which know as BEST service. While such program is popular with commuters, questions remain over the role of park and ride in increasing public transport patronage. The study identify the peak hour of the <b>return</b> <b>routes</b> of P&R users. The methodology of the study was used qualitative comparative analysis. The finding is that comparative between highest and lowest numbers of P&R users for each month {{in order to reduce the}} commuting time. The results show that commuting time is depending on peak hour of <b>return</b> <b>routes</b> of P&R program...|$|R

25|$|On December 21, 1866, Crazy Horse and {{six other}} warriors, both Lakota and Cheyenne, decoyed Capt. William Fetterman's 53 {{infantry}}men and 27 cavalry troopers under Lt. Grummond into an ambush. They had been sent out from Fort Phil Kearny {{to follow up on}} an earlier attack on a wood train. Crazy Horse lured Fetterman's infantry up a hill. Grummond's cavalry followed the other six decoys along Peno Head Ridge and down toward Peno Creek, where several Cheyenne women taunted the soldiers. Meanwhile, Cheyenne leader Little Wolf and his warriors, who had been hiding {{on the opposite side of}} Peno Head Ridge, blocked the <b>return</b> <b>route</b> to the fort. The Lakota warriors swept over the hill and attacked the infantry. Additional Cheyenne and Lakota hiding in the buckbrush along Peno Creek effectively surrounded the soldiers. Seeing that they were surrounded, Grummond headed his cavalry back to Fetterman.|$|E
25|$|A convoy had set {{out from}} Medway at 11:00 and was {{attacked}} by 18 Do17s escorted by 40 Bf109s from Adolf Galland's III./Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26). No ? Squadron attacked JG 26 while six 65 Squadron Spitfires joined in and 610 Squadron scrambled {{to cut off the}} <b>return</b> <b>route</b> but 65 Squadron could not destroy any of the Do17s, because their defensive cross-fire was accurate and the formation kept tight, stopping the British fighters from breaking up the formation. JG 26 lost three two Bf109s; one falling to Colin Falkland Gray, two pilots being killed and one wounded. Running low on fuel, the Bf109s used the advantage of their fuel-injected engines to dive away. The RAF pilots thought that they had been shot down and claiming six, with eight probables. Bf109s from III./Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52) covered the withdrawal of JG 26, ran into Spitfires from 610 Squadron, lost three and a Spitfire pilot was killed and one wounded during a force-landing. A Ju88 from I./LG 1 and a He111 from an unidentified unit were lost with their crews.|$|E
25|$|Wei Yan and Fei Yi {{then took}} {{command of the}} troops left behind. Fei Yi also wrote a letter, which was signed by both of them and would be read out to all the officers. He offered {{to return to the}} main camp and help Wei Yan explain the {{situation}} to Yang Yi. He also said that Yang Yi was a civil official who was less experienced in handling military affairs, so Wei Yan stood a chance of becoming the new commander. Wei Yan then let Fei Yi leave, but he immediately regretted his decision and went after Fei Yi, but could not catch up with him in time. He then sent his subordinate to meet Yang Yi and the others, but was shocked to discover that the various encampments were preparing to retreat in accordance with Zhuge Liang's final orders. Wei Yan wanted to continue the campaign against Cao Wei even though Zhuge Liang had died, so he turned furious when he heard of the retreat. He intended to block the Shu forces from retreating, so he led his force towards the south – ahead of the main army under Yang Yi's command – and sealed the <b>return</b> <b>route</b> by destroying the gallery roads leading back to Shu.|$|E

500|$|Stage {{cylinders}} are cylinders {{which are}} stored by scuba divers along the <b>return</b> <b>route</b> containing decompression and emergency gas. This is only practicable where the <b>return</b> <b>route</b> is known and {{marked by a}} guideline. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings {{at the sides of}} the diver's harness. The divers must avoid breathing oxygen enriched [...] "deco gas" [...] at excessive depths because of the high risk of oxygen toxicity. To prevent this happening, cylinders containing oxygen-rich gases must always be positively identifiable. One way of doing this is by marking them with their maximum operating depth as clearly as possible.|$|E

The town was also on the <b>return</b> <b>route</b> of bombers targeting Bristol and was itself bombed by the Luftwaffe. The first bombs fell in June 1940, but the worst attacks were in January 1941 and in June 1942. Large areas of the town were destroyed, particularly Orchard Street and the Boulevard. On 3 and 4 January 1941, incendiary bombs fell on the town. The Air Ministry set up a [...] "Q-station" [...] decoy at Bleadon {{in an attempt to}} divert the bombers to an unpopulated area.

500|$|When the British troops {{arrived in}} the village of Concord, Lt. Col. Smith divided them to carry out Gage's orders. The 10th Regiment's company of {{grenadiers}} secured South Bridge under Captain Mundy Pole, while seven companies of light infantry under Captain Parsons, numbering about 100, secured the North Bridge, where they were visible across the cleared fields to the assembling militia companies. Captain Parsons took four companies from the 5th, 23rd, 38th and 52nd Regiments up the road [...] beyond the North Bridge to search Barrett's Farm, where intelligence indicated supplies would be found. Two companies from the 4th and 10th Regiments were stationed to guard their <b>return</b> <b>route,</b> and one company from the 43rd remained guarding the bridge itself. [...] These companies, which were under the relatively inexperienced command of Captain Walter Laurie, were aware that they were significantly outnumbered by the 400-plus militiamen.

40|$|The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the world’s largest oceanic flow (∼ 135 {{million cubic}} meters per second), is an {{important}} component of the ocean climate, as it connects the three major oceanic basins. Deep Atlantic water upwells between the ACC and Antarctica and returns to the Atlantic, thus contributing to the closure of the global overturning circulation. The Drake Passage, between the southern tip of South America and Antarctica, is the region where the ACC is most constricted by landmasses and, owing to its narrowness, is the most convenient place to monitor the ACC. The Drake Passage also has considerable oceanographic interest because it lies along the cold, <b>returning</b> <b>route</b> of the global overturning circulation and is a region of strong deepwater mixin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Emerging spatial {{crowdsourcing}} platforms {{enable the}} workers (i. e., crowd) to complete spatial crowdsourcing tasks (like taking photos, conducting citizen journalism) {{that are associated}} with rewards and tagged with both time and location features. In this paper, we study the problem of online recommend-ing an optimal route for a crowdsourcing worker, such that he can (i) reach his destination on time and (ii) receive the maximum reward from tasks along the route. We show that no optimal online algorithm exists in this problem. There-fore, we propose several heuristics, and powerful pruning rules to speed up our methods. Experimental results on real datasets show that our proposed heuristics are very efficient, and <b>return</b> <b>routes</b> that contain 82 – 91 % of the optimal reward. ...|$|R
