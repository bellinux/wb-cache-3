The paper establishes factors that are under accomplished by the site manager and which require improvement towards optimal <b>resources</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Among the facts deduced are the needs for effective management of time and cost saving contrasts; implementation of prefabrication, modular construction systems; and adequate planning before project commences.

40|$|Everyone makes decisions, some simple, others complex. In {{business-to-business}} (B 2 B) marketing environments, decision-making {{becomes even}} more complicated. The decision-makers require an adequate set of facts to support their decision-making. In order to provide the necessary decision-support, B 2 B organisations invest {{huge amounts of money}} in information systems such as enterprise resources planning applications, customer relationship management software, and other types of databases. These systems store, analyse, manipulate and/or integrate internal data and perhaps force-feed it to the decision-makers; what we call a foie-gras approach. On the other hand, organisations may allow the decision-makers to search for the desired facts or decision-support by themselves; what we refer to as anarchic <b>resources</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Alternatively, the decision-makers may utilise resources with {{a combination of the two}} approaches. Previous studies have shown that many factors may influence the resources utilisation; however, not many studies have been conducted in the B 2 B context. This research, therefore, aims to provide a better understanding of how decision-makers utilise the available resources by firstly identifying B 2 B factors affecting the <b>resources</b> <b>utilisation,</b> and then explaining how these factors influence them. Results from in-depth interviews with the marketing decision-makers from three case studies show that the value of customers, supplier-customer relationships, and the nature of demand are the most influential B 2 B factors affecting the <b>resources</b> <b>utilisation</b> of the decision-makers. Other factors such as experience, nature of decisions, and management style are also found to have considerable impact on the approach the decision-makers adopt. In order to provide adequate decision-support, the providers may need to consider these factors and understand their effects on the decision-makers in the organisation, and design or choose the right information system(s); this should then result in better quality decisions.

40|$|Graphics {{rendering}} is {{a complex}} task which needs {{a great number of}} computation resources. Therefore rendering systems (farms) are being developed and used by designers and animators. Because of non-consistent and dynamically changing workload it’s hard to maintain rendering systems fully loaded. So the downtime of such systems is an issue which leads to loss of profit. In this work using of cloud computing services is analysed as a solution to handle <b>resources</b> <b>utilisation</b> problem in graphics rendering systems. A complex of tasks was implemented to do this research. Firstly analysis of existent workload balancer models and graphics rendering systems which uses cloud computing was made. Secondly the information system for graphics rendering was created and resource distribution as a hybrid IaaS cloud was implemented. Algorithm of load balancing between private and public clouds was presented and experimentally tested in this system. Also different job scheduling strategies with ability to predict number of incoming jobs and reserve resources for them were suggested. To determine virtualisation influence to rendering speed an experiment of different resources distribution scenarios in network was made. As a result showed using of this complex solution can raise private <b>resources</b> <b>utilisation</b> level and lower usage of public cloud...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} six {{approaches}} to water management in river basins in Sub-Sahara Africa help ensure {{the sustainability of}} water <b>resources</b> <b>utilisation.</b> These are; threshold contingency planning, sectoral demand management, an integrated approach, proportional water sharing, core water provision and capping of the maximum abstraction volume. The latter three of these six are specific to the non-equilibrium hydrological conditions found in such river basins. These conditions arise because groundwater resources are absent due to basement parent rock, and because a highly dynamic climate, which exogenously supplies the river basin, opens and closes the river basin in wet and dry years respectively. For both proportional and core water allocation, steps can be identified that promote these in ways which are cost efficient, transparent and less resilient to subversion...|$|R

5000|$|On 2 July 2009 Sweden's Riksbank was {{the first}} central bank {{in the world to}} {{implement}} a negative interest rate, when it lowered its repo rate (the rate at which a central bank lends short-term money to commercial banks against securities) to 0.25%. This caused its linked overnight deposit rate (the interest commercial banks get for depositing money with the central bank overnight) to be pushed down to −0.25%, while the overnight lending rate (the interest a central bank charges commercial banks for overnight lending) was lowered to 0.75%. This was done to counter economic slowdown due to the financial crises of 2008. The bank's Deputy Governor Lars E. O.

40|$|The {{model of}} a {{variable}} climate driving natural resource behaviour, use and management of rangelands in Sub-Saharan Africa has been well explored within the non-equilibrium ecology discourse. This paper argues that concepts found in rangelands non-equilibrium thinking have considerable utility if applied to irrigation and river basin management in African savannah landscapes when irrigation has grown in area and coalesced into a larger behavioural unit. The paper suggests that a theory of transition is common to successful rangelands and water management under non-equilibrium conditions. A framework of sustainable water <b>resources</b> <b>utilisation</b> underpinned by non-equilibrium thinking is presented, and some conceptual concerns regarding normative management solutions to water scarcity in Africa are illuminated.
