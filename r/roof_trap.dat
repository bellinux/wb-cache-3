40|$|The {{occurrence}} of gas in salt mines and caverns has presented some serious problems to facility operators. Salt mines have long experienced sudden, usually unexpected expulsions {{of gas and}} salt from a production face, commonly known as outbursts. Outbursts can release over one million cubic feet of methane and fractured salt, and {{are responsible for the}} lives of numerous miners and explosions. Equipment, production time, and even entire mines have been lost due to outbursts. An outburst creates a cornucopian shaped hole that can reach heights of several hundred feet. The potential {{occurrence of}} outbursts must be factored into mine design and mining methods. caverns, the occurrence of outbursts and steady infiltration of gas into stored product can effect the quality of the product, particularly over the long-term, and in some cases renders the product unusable as is or difficult to transport. Gas has also been known to collect in the <b>roof</b> <b>traps</b> of caverns resulting in safety [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|At Le Mans, Maréchal's car {{was well}} placed — 7th overall, 4th in the Index of Performance — when a brake line fractured, causing a brake fluid leak. He continued.

50|$|Feeling {{unwanted}} at the Browns, Paddington {{leaves and}} attempts to track down Montgomery Clyde himself. He finally locates the house, only to learn that Clyde died years ago, and that Millicent resents her father for losing his job and membership with the museum; out of a change of heart, he refused to bring a valuable Peruvian bear specimen home, even though {{it would have made}} his family wealthy. Millicent is determined to succeed where her father failed and capture a Peruvian bear so she can become rich and famous herself. She tranquilizes Paddington and prepares to stuff him, but when Mr. Curry discovers her true intentions, he informs the Brown family and they rush to save Paddington. They rescue him, and Paddington subdues Millicent by throwing at her a marmalade sandwich his uncle left in his hat for emergencies, which attracts a huge flock of pigeons, distracting her, as family relative and housekeeper Mrs. Bird opens a roof hatch and inadvertently pushes her off the <b>roof,</b> <b>trapping</b> her on a flagpole.|$|R
50|$|A {{seawater}} greenhouse {{uses the}} sun, {{the sea and}} the atmosphere to produce fresh water andcool air. The process recreates the natural hydrological cycle within a controlled environment. The front wall of the building is a seawater evaporator. It consists of a honeycomb lattice and faces the prevailing wind. Fans control air movement. Seawater trickles down over the lattice, cooling and humidifying the air passing through into the planting area.Sunlight is filtered through a specially constructed <b>roof.</b> The <b>roof</b> <b>traps</b> infrared heat, while allowing visible light through to promote photosynthesis. This creates optimum growing conditions - cool and humid with high light intensity. Seawater that has been heated in the roof passes through a second evaporator creating hot, saturated air which then flows through a condenser.The condenser is cooled by incoming seawater. The temperature difference causes fresh water to condense out of the air stream. The volume of fresh water is determined by air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and the airflow rate. These conditions can be modeled with appropriate meteorological data, enabling the design and process to be optimized for any suitable location.|$|R

50|$|The Rotunda is a 25-storey {{office block}} {{that housed the}} Mulberry Bush pub on its lower two floors. Within minutes of the warning, police arrived and began {{checking}} the upper floors of the Rotunda, {{but they did not}} have sufficient time to clear the crowded pub at street level. At 20:17, six minutes after the first telephone warning had been delivered to the Birmingham Post, the bomb—which had been concealed inside either a duffel bag or briefcase located close to the rear entrance to the premises—exploded, devastating the pub. The explosion blew a crater measuring 40 inches (101 cm) in the concrete floor, collapsing part of the <b>roof</b> and <b>trapping</b> many casualties beneath girders and concrete blocks. Numerous buildings near the Rotunda were also damaged and passersby in the street were struck by flying glass from shattered windows.

In the exact center, directly beneath the opening in the <b>roof,</b> was a <b>trap,</b> but otherwise the floor was solid. With this knowledge it was only necessary to avoid this spot in so far as the floor was concerned. The walls next received his attention. There were only two openings. One the doorway through which he had entered, and upon the opposite side that through which the warrior had borne Jane Clayton. These were both closed by the slabs of stone which the fleeing warrior had released as he departed.|$|R

He flies back to the park and joins a flock of young sparrow, led by Red. They decided to show Willy the barn they used to hang out, until it was taken over by a big, black cat named Blackie.|$|R
40|$|Green roofs have {{potential}} for providing substantial habitat to plants, birds, and arthropod {{species that are}} not well supported by other urban habitats. Whereas the plants on a typical green roof are chosen and planted by people, the arthropods that colonize it can serve {{as an indicator of}} the ability of this novel habitat to support a diverse community of organisms. The goal of this observational study was to determine which physical characteristics of a roof or characteristics of its vegetation correlate with arthropod diversity on the roof. We intensively sampled the number of insect families on one <b>roof</b> with pitfall <b>traps</b> and also measured the soil arthropod species richness on six green roofs in the Boston, MA area. We found that the number of arthropod species in soil, and arthropod families in pitfall traps, was positively correlated with living vegetation cover. The number of arthropod species was not significantly correlated with plant diversity, green roof size, distance from the ground, or distance to the nearest vegetated habitat from the roof. Our results suggest that vegetation cover may be more important than vegetation diversity for roof arthropod diversity, at least for the first few years after establishment. Additionally, we found that even green roofs that are small and isolated can support a community of arthropods that include important functional groups of the soil food web...|$|R
40|$|Deep {{fractures}} (“fissures”) and avens (“skylights”) in limestone cave <b>roofs</b> create natural <b>traps</b> for sediments and biota. Fissures fill {{quickly with}} surface sediment and organisms soon after opening. Debris cones are formed as materials fall, wash, or drift on air through openings in cave skylights. Such deposits in Admiral's and Grand Canyon Cave, Bermuda contain distinct beds and {{are composed of}} mixtures of sediment and charcoal, together with fossils of land snails, crabs, birds, reptiles, and bats. The “pitfall” accumulations were periodically sealed over by calcite flowstone. A stratigraphic record of surface activity and fauna through both glacial and interglacial periods has been preserved. The succession also provides an ideal setting in which to compare several geochronological methods. Calibrated 14 C ages on charcoal and shells provide dated horizons at 1600, 12, 800, and about 35, 000 14 C yr BP. Thermal ionization mass spectrometric (TIMS) ages on several flowstone layers constrain the entire sequence in the Admiral's Cave sequence between 126, 300 ± 900 yr (Termination II) and historical times. A continuous relative-age record generated by amino acid epimerization (AAE) geochronology (D -alloisoleucine/L -isoleucine or aIle/Ile) on the pulmonate land gastropod Poecilozonites verifies the biostratigraphy, reveals a minimal degree of mixing between stratigraphic units, and establishes an independent temporal link between the subterranean and subaerial deposits of Bermuda. This convergence between stratigraphy and geochronology yields a precisely dated succession from the oceanic island of Bermuda, and thus presents {{a unique opportunity to}} assess the rates and processes of evolutionary and climate change during that interval...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that small-scale, coastal, passive net fisheries {{may be the}} largest single threat to some sea turtle populations. We review assessments of turtle interactions in these fisheries, and experiments on gear-technology approaches (modifying gear designs, materials and fishing methods) to mitigate turtle by-catch, available from {{a small number of}} studies and fisheries. Additional assessments are needed to improve the limited understanding of the relative degree of risk coastal net fisheries pose to turtle populations, to prioritize limited conservation resources and identify suitable mitigation opportunities. Whether gear technology provides effective and commercially viable solutions, alone or in combination with other approaches, is not well-understood. Fishery-specific assessments and trials are needed, as differences between fisheries, including in gear designs; turtle and target species, sizes and abundance; socioeconomic context; and practicality affect efficacy and suitability of by-catch mitigation methods. Promising gear-technology approaches for gillnets and trammel nets include: increasing gear visibility to turtles but not target species, through illumination and line materials; reducing net vertical height; increasing tiedown length or eliminating tiedowns; incorporating shark-shaped silhouettes; and modifying float characteristics, the number of floats or eliminating floats. Promising gear-technology approaches for pound nets and other trap gear include: replacing mesh with ropes in the upper portion of leaders; incorporating a turtle releasing device into traps; modifying the shape of the <b>trap</b> <b>roof</b> to direct turtles towards the location of an escapement device; using an open trap; and incorporating a device to prevent sea turtle entrance into traps.

40|$|Africa's lands - croplands, savannah, {{bush and}} forests - are in danger. Poor land {{management}} is resulting in rapid land degradation: massive soil losses, falling yield potentials, deforestation, {{the disruption of}} water resources, {{and the destruction of}} natural pasture. The same is true {{in many parts of the}} Caribbean and Pacific. Land mismanagement usually results from removing too much, returning too little and cultivating, grazing or cutting too frequently. Land degradation is proceeding so fast that few countries can hope to achieve a sustainable agriculture in the foreseeable future; yet land degradation can be prevented and even reversed. Traditional systems of land use rarely led to rapid deterioration except where large populations were concentrated. Even there, farmers often developed sophisticated and effective conservation measures to overcome the risk of degradation, and to maintain or even raise crop and livestock yields. One such example is southern Ethiopia where the Konso people live in a steep erodible area subject to unreliable rain-fall. Over the years, the Konso have terraced most of their land and developed a complex system of agroforestry and water harvesting. Compost and manure are spread in the fields to maintain fertility, while cattle are stall-fed. The cabbage tree (Moringa stenopetala), from which young green leaves are collected as a vegetable, is planted together with fruit trees in the cropped fields. Planting density is increased on the wetter sites. On steeper slopes, terrace walls are made from double layers of rock, and the space between them is filled with soil and planted with leguminous crops. A variety of annual and perennial crops is sown in staggered or relay-cropping sequences; usually sorghum, finger millet or maize is the main crop, mixed with beans, peas, lentils, fruit trees, medicinal plants, spices, oil-seeds, firewood and timber trees, root crops and cash crops such as cotton and coffee. Another country where effective conservation measures are practiced is Rwanda, one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Although most d the population remains dependent on agriculture, some families now have only 0. 2 - 0. 5 ha of land to farm. Being a mountainous country with tropical rainfall, there is serious risk of erosion. Under these conditions Rwandan farmers have devised ways of maintaining and even increasing yields while protecting the soil from erosion. Land management is based on stall feeding a cow or several sheep to produce manure for composting. Fodder is grown on the banks of the terraces and is fed, together with vegetable waste, to the animals. The compost is spread on the terraces to in crease the organic content of the soil, thereby increasing its permeability, improving its water storage capacity, raising its fertility and hence increasing crop yields and reducing erosion. Rainwater running off <b>roofs</b> is <b>trapped</b> and stored underground for human and livestock use. Land degradation has many causes and there is no universal solution. But the problems of land degradation can be overcome if each country develops its own conservation strategies, policies and programmes tailored to its own peculiar circumstances. Africa's lands - croplands, savannah, bush and forests - are in danger. Poor land management is resulting in rapid land degradation: massive soil losses, falling yield potentials, deforestation, the disruption of water resources, and the [...] ...|$|R
