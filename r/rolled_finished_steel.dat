40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on how Indian Railways can service the steel sector better. The steel sector is a core sector, with {{railways}} playing a critical role in its logistics. The paper examines the changing industry structure and brings to light the increased need for transportation, as compared to normal planning processes. Traditionally, crude and <b>finished</b> <b>steel</b> making was done in the same location by big producers having integrated plants. Now the industry has a large number of producers who primarily focus on crude <b>steel</b> making or <b>finished</b> <b>steel</b> making, necessitating the need for transporting crude <b>steel</b> to the <b>finished</b> <b>steel</b> makers. Even within <b>finished</b> <b>steel</b> making, there could be levels of value addition where the output of one <b>finished</b> <b>steel</b> maker could become the input for another. [W. P.
