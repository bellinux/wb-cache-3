25|$|In the Christian {{tradition}} of European cultures, where ecclesiastical sanction authenticates monarchic power, {{when a new}} monarch assumes the throne in a coronation ceremony, the crown {{is placed on the}} new monarch's head by a religious official.

Napoleon, according to legend, surprised Pius VII when he <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> crowned himself, although in reality this order of ceremony had been pre-arranged (see coronation).|$|E
25|$|Travelling with twelve other monks, Hakuin {{made his}} way to Zuiun-ji, the {{residence}} of Baō Rōjin, a respected scholar but also a tough-minded teacher. While studying with the poet-monk Bao, he had an experience that put him back along the path of monasticism. He saw a number of books piled out in the temple courtyard, books from every school of Buddhism. Struck by the sight of all these volumes of literature, Hakuin prayed to the gods of the Dharma to help him choose a path. He then <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> took a book; it was a collection of Zen stories from the Ming Dynasty. Inspired by this, he repented and dedicated himself to the practice of Zen.|$|E

2500|$|Every {{morning before}} {{beginning}} work, I visited the animals. One of the elephants, Candy, loved to be scratched on the belly behind her foreleg.

One time I started {{to walk away from}} her, and she <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> took my wrist with her trunk and pulled me back to her side. It was a command: [...] "Don't stop!" [...] I used it in the picture. Noah scratches the elephant's belly and walks away, and the elephant pulls him back to her time after time.|$|E

It's really important for me to take my time with this record and it's important for the whole team. It's really, really good energy." [...] She has been working on the album with a number of producers and songwriters, including Hit-Boy, Soundz, Diane Warren, Tricky Stewart, and The Underdogs. In {{an interview}}, Ciara said [...] "I worked with some people that are very fresh, which I'm excited about...

2500|$|In a January 2014 {{interview}} with Vibe, record producer Boi-1da confirmed working significantly {{on the album}} saying, [...] "It’s new-age with that old Mobb twist to it.

2500|$|That {{is such a}} {{difficult}} question. There are times when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas {{was one of these}} people. It was as if her own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her so. I know it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand." [...] She couldn't really explain what she did. It was all done by instinct. It was something embedded deep within her.|$|E
