Methods and Materials: Eligible patients (n = 159; response rate 54 %) of 15 radiation oncologists completed the IPRP and provided background characteristics before their first radiotherapy consultation. Exclusion criteria were: age < 18 years, having undergone radiotherapy before, unable to read and write Dutch, cognitive problems or a brain tumor. Results: Reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0. 84 - 0. 97) and concurrent validity (r from. 39 to. 57, p < 0. 001) of the sub-scales of the IPRP were good. New <b>radiotherapy</b> <b>patients</b> want extensive information about their disease, treatment, procedures, side effects, and prognosis (mean scores between 4. 1 and 4. 4 on a scale from 1 to 5) but less information about psychosocial issues (mean = 3. 4). Patients who are older and male, have lung or rectal cancer, more difficulty understanding and a higher trait anxiety level, need less information. Conclusions: The IPRP can reliably and validly address information needs of patients undergoing radiation treatment. Most new <b>radiotherapy</b> <b>patients</b> want much information. Yet, information giving should be tailored according to their background, understanding and anxiety. (C) 2012 Elsevier In...|$|R
40|$|Dr. Willet Whitmore, {{the father}} of urologic oncology, is perhaps best remembered for his question: “For a patient with {{prostate}} cancer, if treatment for cure is necessary, is it pos-sible?

40|$|Introduction There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} {{to guide the}} preparation of patients for radiotherapy. This paper describes the protocol for an evaluation of a radiation therapist led education intervention delivered to patients with breast cancer {{in order to reduce}} psychological distress. Methods A multiple-baseline study is being used. Usual care data is being collected {{prior to the start of}} the intervention at each of three sites. The intervention is delivered by radiation therapists consulting with patients prior to their treatment planning and on the first day of treatment. The intervention focuses on providing sensory and procedural information to patients and reducing pretreatment anxiety. Recruitment is occurring in three states in Australia. Eligible participants are patients who have been referred for radiotherapy to treat breast cancer. 200 patients will be recruited during a usual care phase and, thereafter, 200 patients in the intervention phase. Measures will be collected on four occasions—after meeting with their radiation oncologist, prior to treatment planning, on the first day of treatment and after treatment completion. The primary hypothesis is that patients who receive the radiotherapy preparatory intervention will report a significantly greater decrease in psychological distress from baseline to prior to radiotherapy treatment planning in comparison with the usual care group. Secondary outcome measures include concerns about <b>radiotherapy,</b> <b>patient</b> knowledge of <b>radiotherapy,</b> <b>patient</b> preparedness and quality of life. Patient health system usage and costs will also be measured. Multilevel mixed effects regression models will be applied to test for intervention effects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} baseline health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with localized prostate cancer before primary treatment (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy). METHODS: Two hundred patients with newly diagnosed localized (screen-detected or clinically diagnosed) prostate cancer completed HRQOL questionnaires (generic and disease-specific measures). Clinical data were collected from patients' medical records in four Rotterdam hospitals. RESULTS: Screen-detected tumors were of more favorable stages and grades than clinically diagnosed ones. The diagnostic groups did not differ significantly in bowel and sexual functioning. Differences were found in urinary functioning, favoring patients with screen-detected tumors of T 2 -T 3 stages. Patients with screen-detected T 2 cancer reported better generic HRQOL (physical aspects) than the clinical group, but HRQOL of the latter group was similar to the population norm. <b>Radiotherapy</b> <b>patients</b> were significantly older and had more comorbidity than subjects referred to prostatectomy. Urinary, bowel, and sexual problems were uncommon. Older (> 65 years) <b>radiotherapy</b> <b>patients</b> appeared to be less sexually active. <b>Radiotherapy</b> <b>patients</b> also reported poorer levels of generic HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected prostate cancer patients presented with more favorable cancer stage and grade. HRQOL was related to both the tumor stage and the detection method. Pre-treatment HRQOL differences between prostatectomy and <b>radiotherapy</b> <b>patients</b> were associated neither with tumor characteristics nor with the detection method.

Thrombocytosis has frequently {{been found to be}} associated with various malignancies. Case report: 53 years old female patient hospitalized because of hypopharingeal cancer with metastasis in the left neck. Her state was complicated with deep leg vein thrombosis and pseudomonas infection. Persistent thrombocitosis in laboratory monitoring indicated more adequate diagnostic procedures, which led to discovering of Chorioidal Malignant Mellanoma as a second cancer. She was treated: Surgically, with antibiotics, with anticoagulants and <b>radiotherapy.</b> <b>Patient</b> was discharged from the hospital in good health condition, free of any other symptom of the malignant disease.

In the clinical setting, {{the effectiveness of}} beta-emitters has not been studied in {{a broad spectrum of}} patients, particularly those receiving stents. METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective, randomized, sham-controlled study of intracoronary radiotherapy with the beta-emitting (32) P source wire, using a centering catheter and automated source delivery unit, was conducted. A total of 105 patients with de novo (70 %) or restenotic (30 %) lesions who were treated by stenting (61 %) or balloon angioplasty (39 %) received 0 (control), 16, 20, or 24 Gy to a depth of 1 mm in the artery wall. Angiography at 6 months showed a target site late loss index of 11 +/- 36 % in <b>radiotherapy</b> <b>patients</b> versus 55 +/- 30 % in controls (P:/= 50 %) rates were significantly lower in <b>radiotherapy</b> <b>patients</b> at the target site (8 % versus 39 %; P:= 0. 012) and at target site plus adjacent segments (22 % versus 50 %; P:= 0. 018).

40|$|MINERVA (Modality-Inclusive Environment for Radiotherapeutic Variable Analysis) is a Java-based patient-centric {{radiation}} treatment planning system (RTPS) for computational dosimetry and treatment planning in emerging areas of radiotherapy for {{cancer and other}} diseases. MINERVA was primarily developed at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and Montana State University (MSU). MINERVA allows the radiotherapist to make side-by-side comparison of plans for multiple treatment modalities with a common anatomical basis for the computational geometry, calculate doses for combinations of different radiotherapy modalities, and perform dose analysis and reporting functions. This provides the therapist with a consistent basis for selecting the modality or combination of modalities to use for treatment of the patient.

40|$|In {{images with}} low contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the {{information}} {{gain from the}} observed pixel values can be insufficient to distinguish foreground objects. A Bayesian approach to this problem is to incorporate prior information about the objects into a statistical model.

We followed 314 men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer from 1 month before until 5 years after radical prostatectomy (n = 127) or external beam radiotherapy (n = 187; median follow-up = 52 months). Questionnaires addressing disease-specific (UCLA PCI) and generic (SF- 36, EQ- 5 D) HRQoL were sent 1 month before and 6, 12 and 52 months after treatment. Repeated-measures modeling was used to study HRQoL over time. Regular urinary leakage was reported by 12 % of prostatectomy patients before treatment and by 31 % at the 52 -month assessment. Erectile dysfunction before treatment was reported by 31 % of prostatectomy patients and by 40 % of radiotherapy patients; at the 52 -month assessment, these percentages were 88 % and 64 %, respectively. Erectile dysfunction present at 1 year posttreatment can be considered permanent.
