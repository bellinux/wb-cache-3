60|$|Now, the {{condition}} of this mass implies a rotation about an imaginary axis—a rotation which, commencing with the absolute incipiency of the aggregation, has been ever since acquiring velocity. The very first two atoms which met, approaching each other from points not diametrically opposite, would, in rushing partially past each other, form a nucleus for the <b>rotary</b> <b>movement</b> described. How this would increase in velocity, is readily seen. The two atoms are joined by others:—an aggregation is formed. The mass continues to rotate while condensing. But any atom at the circumference has, of course, a more rapid motion than one nearer the centre. The outer atom, however, with its superior velocity, approaches the centre; carrying this superior velocity with it as it goes. Thus every atom, proceeding inwardly, and finally attaching itself to the condensed centre, adds something to the original velocity of that centre—that is to say, increases the <b>rotary</b> <b>movement</b> of the mass.|$|E

60|$|I {{have said}} that Sir Thomas Rossiter wore a large hat drawn down over his brows. As he entered the hall he {{uncovered}} himself, and I was at once aware of a singular characteristic which the hat had concealed. His forehead, which was naturally high, and higher still on account of receding hair, was in a continual state of movement. Some nervous weakness kept the muscles in a constant spasm, which sometimes produced a mere twitching and sometimes a curious <b>rotary</b> <b>movement</b> unlike anything which I had ever seen before. It was strikingly visible as he turned towards us after entering the study, and seemed the more singular from the contrast with the hard, steady, grey eyes which looked out from underneath those palpitating brows.|$|E

60|$|We must draw {{attention}} here {{to one of}} these deviations. According to Newton's theory, a planet moves round the sun in an ellipse, which would permanently maintain its position with respect to the fixed stars, if we could disregard the motion of the fixed stars themselves and the action of the other planets under consideration. Thus, if we correct the observed motion of the planets for these two influences, and if Newton's theory be strictly correct, we ought to obtain for the orbit of the planet an ellipse, which is fixed with reference to the fixed stars. This deduction, which can be tested with great accuracy, has been confirmed for all the planets save one, with the precision that is capable of being obtained by the delicacy of observation attainable at the present time. The sole exception is Mercury, the planet which lies nearest the sun. Since the time of Leverrier, it has been known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit of Mercury, after it has been corrected for the influences mentioned above, is not stationary with respect to the fixed stars, but that it rotates exceedingly slowly in the plane of the orbit and {{in the sense of the}} orbital motion. The value obtained for this <b>rotary</b> <b>movement</b> of the orbital ellipse was 43 seconds of arc per century, an amount ensured to be correct to within a few seconds of arc. This effect can be explained by means of classical mechanics only on the assumption of hypotheses which have little probability, and which were devised solely for this purponse.|$|E

40|$|FoF 1 -ATP synthase is {{the enzyme}} that {{provides}} the 'chemical energy currency' adenosine triphosphate, ATP, for living cells. The formation of ATP is accomplished by a stepwise internal rotation of subunits within the enzyme. We monitor subunit rotation by a single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach using two fluorophores specifically attached to the enzyme. To identify the stepsize of <b>rotary</b> <b>movements</b> by the motors of ATP synthase we simulated the confocal single-molecule FRET data of freely diffusing enzymes and developed a step finder algorithm based on 'Hidden Markov Models' (HMM). The HMM is {{able to find the}} proximity factors, P, for a three-level system and for a five-level system, and to unravel the dwell times of the simulated <b>rotary</b> <b>movements.</b> To identify the number of hidden states in the system, a likelihood parameter is calculated for the series of one-state to eight-state HMMs applied to each set of simulated data. Thereby, the basic prerequisites for the experimental single-molecule FRET data are defined that allow for discrimination between a 120 degree stepping mode or a 36 degree substep rotation mode for the proton-driven Fo motor of ATP synthase.

40|$|In the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, many {{behaviors}} are partially or fully functional but are actively suppressed prior to normal expression. The pupal gin-trap reflex {{is such a}} behavior and its development prior to repression was examined both behaviorally and physiologically. Behavioral responses similar to the pupae were observed in the latter stages of wandering. These responses were rapid lateral flexions and <b>rotary</b> abdomenal <b>movements.</b> The responses differed from the pupal responses in that the flexions were not segment-specific and the <b>rotary</b> <b>movements</b> were {{not confined to the}} abdomen as in the pupa. Physiological responses similar in amplitude to the pupa were also observed in the motorneurons during this stage. The responses also resembled the pupal by way of rapid depolarizations followed by inhibition. The responses differed by being non-segment-specific and repetitive in nature during a stimulation period. The results suggest the reflex is at least partially functional prior to pupation...|$|R
