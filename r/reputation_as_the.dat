5|$|Also {{known as}} Nam Tin Hotel, the Great Southern Hotel in Singapore's Chinatown {{was built by}} Swan and Maclaren in 1936. Started as a {{boutique}} hotel, it was the tallest building in Chinatown when it was completed. It {{was also the first}} Chinese hotel in Singapore with a lift. Its height also gave it an unfortunate <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> focal point of many suicide attempts in its early days, until the tall Singapore Improvement Trust flats at Upper Pickering Street were built.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, Stalin {{closed down}} {{independent}} artists' unions; former avant-garde artists had {{to adapt to}} the new climate or risk being officially criticised or even blacklisted. Lissitzky retained his <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> master of exhibition art and management into the late 1930s. His tuberculosis gradually reduced his physical abilities, and he was becoming more and more dependent on his wife in actual completion of his work.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a Maronite priest's complaints about harassment by Shia Muslims against Christians, Shahin's men attacked and plundered Shia villages and travelers in Jubail and demanded that Shia villages convert to Christianity to avoid assault. The Shia residents of Jubail protested these assaults in June 1859.

50|$|As Rome grew, so did its tabernae, {{becoming}} more luxurious and acquiring {{good or bad}} <b>reputations</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> case may be. One of the best hotels was the Tabernae Caediciae at Sinuessa on the Via Appia. It had a large storage room containing barrels of wine, cheese and ham. Many cities of today grew up around a taberna complex, such <b>as</b> Rheinzabern in <b>the</b> Rhineland, and Saverne in Alsace.|$|R
5|$|The Caltech–MIT rivalry is {{a college}} rivalry between California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), {{stemming}} from <b>the</b> colleges' <b>reputations</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> top {{science and engineering}} schools in the United States. The rivalry is unusual given the geographic distance between the schools (their campuses are separated by about 3000 miles and are on opposite coasts of <b>the</b> United States), <b>as</b> well as its focus on elaborate pranks rather than sporting events.|$|R
5|$|The series follows Sora and {{his younger}} stepsister Shiro, two hikikomori {{who make up the}} {{identity}} of Blank, an undefeated group of gamers.

5|$|After the 1973 {{season the}} team fired Webster, who later {{admitted}} {{his heart was}} never in head coaching, and said he more enjoyed life as an assistant. They hired retired star defensive end Andy Robustelli to run their football operations, and he picked Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger as the team's head coach. Arnsparger had built an enviable <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> architect of the Dolphins defense which helped the team to two Super Bowl championships. Robustelli traded their 1975 first round draft choice to the Cowboys (who used it to select Hall of Fame defensive lineman Randy White) for quarterback Craig Morton {{in the middle of}} the 1974 season.|$|E

5|$|Avril Lavigne is {{considered}} a highlight in the pop-punk and alternative pop-rock scene since she helped to {{paved the way for}} the success of female-driven punk-influenced pop music, such as Paramore, Skye Sweetnam, Fefe Dobson, Lillix, Kelly Osbourne, Krystal Meyers, Tonight Alive, Hey Monday, among others as being a direct result. She was compared to alternative female singer-songwriters of the 1990s such as Alanis Morissette, Liz Phair and Courtney Love and earned a <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> greatest female representative of pop-punk music, and also as one of the female singers who best represent 2000s rock music. Lavigne also was seen as a fashion icon for her skatepunk and rocker style.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1874, Smetana {{had become}} {{completely}} deaf but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, he began a period of sustained composition that continued for almost {{the rest of his}} life. His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum and subsequent death. Smetana's <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> founding father of Czech music has endured in his native country, where advocates have raised his status above that of his contemporaries and successors. However, relatively few of Smetana's works are in the international repertory, and most foreign commentators tend to regard Antonín Dvořák as a more significant Czech composer.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{started from}} the second row of the grid at the German Grand Prix, but was into the lead soon after the start. There he {{remained}} to the finish, in front of von Brauchitsch and Rosemeyer. He took pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix three weeks later, and was soon engaged in a hard fight with von Brauchitsch. The Mercedes-Benz drivers took the lead from each other several times, but von Brauchitsch won after a screw fell into Caracciola's induction system during a pit stop, costing him {{three and a half}} minutes. Caracciola won his second race of the season at the Swiss Grand Prix. Despite heavy rain which made the Bremgarten Circuit slippery and hazardous, Caracciola set a new lap record, at an average speed of , and cemented his <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Regenmeister.|$|E

5|$|Darwin was a {{prolific}} writer. Even without {{publication of his}} works on evolution, {{he would have had}} a considerable <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> author of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, Great Britain {{made her}} first voyage to Melbourne, Australia, {{carrying}} 630 emigrants. She excited great interest there, with 4,000 people paying a shilling each to inspect her.

Gradually, {{she earned a}} <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> most reliable of the emigrant ships to Australia and carried the first English cricket team to tour Australia in 1861.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald's <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> premier {{who led the}} {{province}} out of the Great Depression rested on his commitment to ambitious government projects such as highway construction and rural electrification. He continued to support highway improvements throughout his career. Two projects that he pushed especially hard for, the Canso Causeway linking Cape Breton Island to mainland Nova Scotia and a suspension bridge spanning Halifax Harbour were completed after his death. The bridge, named in his honour, {{made it possible to}} travel between Halifax and Dartmouth without having to board a ferry or drive several kilometres around the Bedford Basin.|$|E
