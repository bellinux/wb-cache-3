25|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry, or DSC, is a thermoanalytical {{technique in}} which {{the difference in the}} amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The <b>reference</b> <b>sample</b> should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of temperatures to be scanned.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to introduce the reader to resampling estimation techniques in general and in using Microsoft Excel(R) 2010 for the purpose of estimating reference intervals in particular. Parametric methods are preferable to resampling methods when the distributions of observations in the <b>reference</b> <b>samples</b> is Gaussian or can transformed to that distribution even when the number of <b>reference</b> <b>samples</b> is less than 120. Resampling methods are appropriate when the distribution of data from the <b>reference</b> <b>samples</b> is non-Gaussian and in case the number of reference individuals and corresponding samples are in the order of 40. At least 500 - 1000 random samples with replacement should be taken from the results of measurement of the <b>reference</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of both modern X-ray {{fluorescence}} (XRF) methods and improved analytical reliability requirements the demand for suitable <b>reference</b> <b>samples</b> has increased. Especially in nanotechnology with the very low areal mass depositions, quantification becomes considerably more difficult. However, the availability of suited <b>reference</b> <b>samples</b> is drastically lower than the demand. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques have been enhanced significantly {{in the last decade}} driven by the need for extremely precise film parameters in multilayer production. We have applied those techniques for the development of layer-like <b>reference</b> <b>samples</b> with mass depositions in the ng-range and well below. Several types of <b>reference</b> <b>samples</b> were fabricated: multi-elemental layer and extremely low (sub-monolayer) samples for various applications in XRF and total-reflection XRF (TXRF) analysis. Those samples were characterized and compared at three different synchrotron radiation beamlines at the BESSY II electron storage ring employing the reference-free XRF approach based on physically calibrated instrumentation. In addition, the homogeneity of the multi-elemental coatings was checked at the P 04 beamline at DESY. The measurements demonstrate the high precision achieved in the manufacturing process as well as the versatility of application fields for the presented <b>reference</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R
25|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry (DSC) is {{an analytical}} technique {{used to examine}} thermodynamic properties of molecules. It can study the thermal behavior of materials as they undergo physical and chemical changes during heat treatment. The parameters that are measured {{are referred to as}} the glass transition value (Tg) and melting temperature (Tm). These values are measured over time and are comparable between an inert <b>reference</b> <b>sample</b> and the analyte. Changes in the (Tm) and (Tg) values evaluate phase changes (solid, liquid-gel, liquid, etc.) in which an endothermic or exothermic process occurs. This technique is useful for monitoring the phase changes in phospholipids by providing information such as the amount of heat released or absorbed and time for phase transitions to occur, etc. DSC monitoring can occur at slow rates which is a disadvantage in monitoring fast phase transitions within phospholipids.|$|E
25|$|Some atomic nuclei {{possess a}} {{magnetic}} moment (nuclear spin), which {{gives rise to}} different energy levels and resonance frequencies in a magnetic field. The total magnetic field experienced by a nucleus includes local magnetic fields induced by currents of electrons in the molecular orbitals (note that electrons have a magnetic moment themselves). The electron distribution of {{the same type of}} nucleus (e.g. 1H, 13C, 15N) usually varies according to the local geometry (binding partners, bond lengths, angles between bonds, and so on), and with it the local magnetic field at each nucleus. This is reflected in the spin energy levels (and resonance frequencies). The variations of nuclear magnetic resonance frequencies of the same kind of nucleus, due to variations in the electron distribution, is called the chemical shift. The size of the chemical shift is given with respect to a reference frequency or <b>reference</b> <b>sample</b> (see also chemical shift referencing), usually a molecule with a barely distorted electron distribution.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} the golden crown {{does not appear in}} the known works of Archimedes. Moreover, the {{practicality}} of the method it describes has been called into question, due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement. Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in hydrostatics as Archimedes' principle, which he describes in his treatise On Floating Bodies. This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the crown to that of pure gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a pure gold <b>reference</b> <b>sample</b> of the same weight, then immersing the apparatus in water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly. Galileo considered it [...] "probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself." [...] In a 12th-century text titled Mappae clavicula there are instructions on how to perform the weighings in the water in order to calculate the percentage of silver used, and thus solve the problem. The Latin poem Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris of the 4th or 5th century describes the use of a hydrostatic balance {{to solve the problem of}} the crown, and attributes the method to Archimedes.|$|E

500|$|Max Mosley, the {{president}} of the FIA, also responded to Schumacher's comments saying that his comments [...] "reflect poorly on the sport and show a lack of adult attitude". Mosley also commented on the weight issue surrounding Schumacher saying that [...] "it is a pity that it became a matter for public discussion, whether he drank a huge amount of water, didn't go to the loo or had a heavy helmet. It is just a pity he didn't take care that it didn't happen". Elf was also unhappy with {{the way in which the}} episode had been handled, the company's Commercial Director Michel Bonnet declaring that [...] "We believe the FIA acted in a high-handed manner in disqualifying our two cars so quickly. It should have declared the results provisional and waited for the results of further analysis. Acting the way it did, the FIA has affected the image of large industrial companies, of top F1 teams and of famous drivers. The fact that we have been treated as cheats by a red team â€“ probably red with embarrassment at having finished one lap behind our cars â€“ and by Gerhard Berger is a serious slur against us." [...] Elf also threatened to take the matter to a tribunal if the cars were not reinstated. Company representative Valerie Jorquera also highlighted the need for a consistent chromatographic analysis of fuel samples, drawing attention to the fact that the samples provided during the event had been analysed by a different company than the <b>reference</b> <b>sample,</b> and that the differences may have been caused by the use of different analytical machines and methods. The incident was seen as unfortunate for the sport, which was trying to make a fresh start after several controversies the previous year. From the San Marino Grand Prix onwards, an FIA mobile fuel laboratory accompanied the teams to each event to permit more detailed testing at the track, in addition to ensuring consistency between events.|$|E

When this is not available (e.g. because a court order is needed but not obtainable) other methods may need to be used to collect a sample of blood, saliva, semen, vaginal lubrication, or other appropriate fluid or tissue from personal items (e.g. a toothbrush, razor) or from stored samples (e.g. banked sperm or biopsy tissue). Samples obtained from blood relatives (related by birth, not marriage) can provide an indication of an individual's profile, as could human remains that had been previously profiled.|$|E

We also demonstrated that our normalization method affected RSD for each entry in metabolite-dependent manner (Additional file 3 : Table S 3).

2500|$|Before {{testing a}} sample, the Spectronic 20 is {{calibrated}} using a blank solution, {{which is the}} pure solvent that {{is used in the}} experimental sample. [...] It is typically water or an organic solvent. [...] In this calibration, the transmittance is set at 100% using the calibration knob of the instrument (the amplifier control knob in the figure at right). The instrument can also optionally be calibrated with a stock solution of a sample at a concentration known to have an absorbance of 2 or else vendor supplied standards, using the light absorption knob in the diagram shown at right. After calibration, the user places a 1/2 inch test tube or cuvette containing the sample solution to be measured into the sample compartment. Calibration is repeated each time the wavelength is changed. It or a standard <b>reference</b> <b>sample</b> is generally used to periodically check for drift. To measure wavelengths above 650 nm, the bottom of the instrument is opened, and a red filter and a red-sensitive photocell is installed.|$|E
