For all rotors, experimental results showed that the mean soil clod diameter decreased and soil inversion increased with increasing rotational speed of the rotor.

40|$|Abstract. Small {{agricultural}} machinery with forward and reverse-rotational <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> was proposed for {{solving the problem}} of cultivation with compacted soil. Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) based models of forward and reverse-rotational <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> were carried out using the LS-DYNA software. SPH is a mesh free method, thus large material distortions {{that occur in the}} soil cutting problem are easily managed. In most earth moving machinery, such as bulldozers or tillage tools, the working tool is a blade. Hence for tillage systems, accurately predicting the forces acting on the blade is of prime importance in helping to enhance productivity. Structural parameters of reverse-rotational <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> were studied and optimized with orthogonal test and numerical simulating technology. Results show that forward and reverse-rotational rotary tool can independently work for the cutting of compacted soil with different operating resistance. It is perfectly feasible to apply the proposed composite rotary tiller to compacted soil deep-tilling with low power motor. Proper structural parameters of forward and reverse-rotational <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> can reduce the power consumption. This method provides theoretical basis for the design of tools...|$|R

Moreover, there is no obvious weight loss in boronizing-status sample after 168 hours’ corrosion in the fertilizer-containing soil, while the weight of lonnealing-status sample is lighter than the original weight after about 150 hours’ corrosion.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} processes {{used to create}} <b>compressor</b> <b>blades</b> inevitably introduce geometric variability to the blade surface. In addition to increasing the performance variability, {{it has been observed}} that introducing geometric variability tends to reduce the mean performance of <b>compressor</b> <b>blades.</b> For example, the mean adiabatic efficiency observed in <b>compressor</b> <b>blades</b> with geometric variability is typically lower than the efficiency in the absence of variability. This “mean-shift” in performance leads to increased operating costs {{over the life of the}} <b>compressor</b> <b>blade.</b> These detrimental effects can be reduced by using robust optimization techniques to optimize the blade geometry. The impact of geometric variability can also be reduced by imposing stricter tolerances, thereby directly reducing the allowable level of variability. However, imposing stricter manufacturing tolerances increases the cost of manufacturing. Thus, the blade design and tolerances must be chosen with both performance and manufacturing cost in mind. This paper presents a computational framework for performing simultaneous robust design and tolerancing of <b>compressor</b> <b>blades</b> subject to manufacturing variability. The manufacturing variability is modelled as a Gaussian random field with non-stationary variance to simulate the effects of spatially varying manufacturing tolerances. The statistical performance of the <b>compressor</b> <b>blade</b> system is evaluated using the Monte Carlo method.
