This means that there is a direct connection between the payments system and monetary policy and implies that institutional changes in the payments system, such as new clearing and settlement methods, may require corresponding changes in monetary policy operating procedures. Second, the absence of binding <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> may lead to increased volatility of short-term interest rates and impair the ability of central banks to implement monetary policy.

Western central banks rarely increase the reserve requirements because it would cause immediate liquidity problems for banks with low excess reserves; they generally prefer to use open market operations (buying and selling government-issued bonds) to implement their monetary policy.

The Romanian Central Bank governor, Mugur Isărescu, admitted the target was ambitious, but obtainable if the political parties passed a legal roadmap for the required reforms to be implemented, and clarified this roadmap should lead to Romania entering ERM-2 only on 1 January 2017 so the euro could be adopted after two years of ERM-2 membership on 1 January 2019. In April 2015, Isărescu stated that the technical requirement for adoption of the euro 1 January 2019 would imply joining ERM-2 at the latest in the first half of 2016.

But maintaining reserve requiremnts needs a contemporary rationale, no matter what their original purposes may have been. The obvious reasons to maintain reserve requiremets are to regulate bank liquidity, to conduct monetary policy (regulation of the money multiplier or short-term interest rates) and to pay the special "tax" to the state budget. This article deals especially with the third reason but the liquidity and monetary policy are also discussed. All three rationales seems not to be equivalent to the burden of the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> on the banking system and to the distorting effects on financial markets.
