40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the control of {{bilateral}} teleoperation systems when the nonlinear external environment forces are considered as measured perturbations. To deal with this, we propose a nonlinear control strategy based on the π-flatness concept which is an interesting property for the tracking control of nonlinear time-delays systems. This strategy is composed by two steps: an open-loop feedforward control which allows to track the <b>reference</b> <b>master</b> trajectory; and a stabilization of the slave system around the desired trajectory using a predictive polynomial control. Therefore, we extend the usual Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) via a π-flat output to the case where the <b>reference</b> <b>master</b> trajectory is not a priori known. This difficulty is due to the bilateral aspect where the environment force feedback alters this reference trajectory. This extended GPC structure introduces robustness properties which are discussed in this paper.

When the rotor blades were mounted on the wind turbine tower, ice thickness inspections became nearly impossible to be performed {{in the past but}} by image base modeling methods, geometry extraction of ice of frosted blades are possible in the form of mesh models. In this research thesis, 3 D model of wind turbine blades without ice is designed as <b>reference</b> <b>Master</b> CAD data. A prototype of this CAD model is made by a 3 D printer machine which after painting, a pattern of retro targets is added to blades surfaces. Digital Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) camera is used to capture several images of objects with different modes of lighting and illumination. A series of point clouds is produced by using the Structure from Motion (SfM) method and VisualSfM software. Each point cloud has an arbitrary coordinate system that is scaled and transferred to Global Coordinate System by 3 D transform on CATIA software based on similar features between 3 D point cloud and master CAD data. When the ice has sufficient texture, such as rime ice and the texture is captured in the images, a point cloud corresponding to the captured region will also be detected. The position of ice on the blades is detected by coded retro targets on blade’s surface and the order of image acquisition. The generated point cloud and its mesh are compared with the Master CAD or reference geometric model and finally shows in 3 D format, the shape, thickness and approximate mass of ice on the blades. This study focused on the feasibility of reconstruction of 3 D polygonal mesh models by images captured from a wind turbine blade with a configuration of digital SLR cameras. The main objective of this reconstruction is to identify the volume and shape of ice-accumulated areas on the wind turbine blades in arctic regions. Geometrical comparison of these triangular mesh models with the non-iced blade CAD data could reveal the geometry of accumulated ice...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. All {{people are}} {{consumers}} of various textile products. In {{the process of}} obtaining these products, consumers are subjected to a consumer decision making process of realising a need, searching for a suitable product, evaluating alternatives, and eventually choosing and purchasing a product to their satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Besides the obvious characteristics of a textile product such as colour, size and style, the fabric label attached to the product {{is one of the}} stimuli which helps the consumer to make a decision to purchase or not. The label is the only source of information about the fibre content, size and care of the product: As very little is known about South African students' perception of textile product labels and their consequent purchasing behaviour, the aim {{of this study was to}} explore this phenomenon. The study was done amongst both male and female students between the age of 18 and 30 years at the University of Zululand. Several focus group discussions were held. The data were analysed by making use of thematic content analysis. The study found that students were aware of textile product labels and of most of the information that is generally displayed on such labels, such as fibre content, care instructions and brand name. It was found that participants had strong opinions about the location of the label. The display of labels with a brand name on textile products was perceived as both a status symbol associated with the class level of the user and also as a preference for quality. Labels with a well-known brand name have the most influence on the purchasing decision, while it was found that the care instructions on labels have very little or no influence. The size indication on a label influences the purchasing decision dramatically. Participants who do not find the right size become frustrated because they experience this as bad service from the retailer. Packaging labels and tags influence purchasing behaviour like any other labels. The difference however, is that these are generally not kept by consumers for later <b>reference.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in versatile automated gauging have enabled accurate geometric tolerance assessment on the shop floor. This paper {{is concerned with}} the uncertainty evaluation associated with comparative coordinate measurement using the design of experiments (DOE) approach. It employs the Renishaw Equator which is a software-driven comparative gauge based on the traditional comparison of production parts to a <b>reference</b> <b>master</b> part. The fixturing requirement of each production part to the master part is approximately ± 1 mm for a comparison process with an uncertainty of ± 2 μm. Therefore, a number of experimental designs are applied with the main focus on the influence of part misalignment from rotation between master and measure coordinate frames on the comparator measurement uncertainty. Other factors considered include measurement mode mainly in scanning and touch-trigger probing (TTP) and alignment procedure used to establish the coordinate reference frame (CRF) with respect to the number of contact points used for each geometric feature measured. The measurement uncertainty analysis of the comparator technique used by the Equator gauge commences with a simple measurement task using a gauge block to evaluate the three-dimensional (3 D) uncertainty of length comparative coordinate measurement influenced by an offset by tilt in one direction (two-dimensional angular misalignment). Then, a specific manufactured measurement object is employed so that the comparator measurement uncertainty can be assessed for numerous measurement tasks within a satisfactory range of the working volume of the versatile gauge. Furthermore, in the second case study, different types of part misalignment including both 2 D and 3 D angular misalignments are applied. The time required for managing the re-mastering process is also examined. A task specific uncertainty evaluation is completed using DOE. Also, investigating the effects of process variations that might be experienced by such a device in workshop environments. It is shown that the comparator measurement uncertainties obtained by all the experiments agree with system features under specified conditions. It is also demonstrated that when the specified conditions are exceeded, the comparator measurement uncertainty is associated with the measurement task, the measurement strategy used, the feature size, and the magnitude and direction of offset angles in relation to the reference axes of the machine. In particular, departures from the specified part fixturing requirement of Equator have a more significant effect on the uncertainty of length measurement in comparator mode and a less significant effect on the diameter measurement uncertainty for the specific Equator and test conditions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{multisensor}} fusion {{in the presence}} of systematic errors in the context of target tracking. A typical target tracking problem consists of multiple sensors producing position measurements of multiple targets, for instance aircraft. The goal is to establish tracks on all targets that are observed by the sensors. A track usually consists of an id, such as a track number, target position, and target velocity. The systematic errors are modeled as measurement biases. If unaccounted for these biases may lead to inaccurate estimates of the target state (position and in particular velocity) and a single target may appear as several targets if the biases are large enough (ghost tracks). Furthermore, if all sensors are biased it is challenging to find an unbiased estimate of target state with respect to a coordinate system independent of the sensors. In this thesis the sensors are radars producing measurements in 3 D. The systematic errors (biases) are called alignment bias, location bias and sensor bias. The first two are related to sensor deployment, as they describe errors in orientation (misalignment) and sensor placement (location). The sensor bias addresses errors caused by sensor imperfections. These biases are estimated relative to a sensor independent coordinate system and relative to a sensor of <b>reference</b> (<b>master</b> sensor). A novel distinction is made in this context, where a universal bias estimator (UBE) is used relative to sensor independent coordinates, while an absolute bias estimator (ABE) is used relative to a master sensor. The estimability of the biases is investigated using a novel estimability index, which quantifies whether a bias can be estimated more accurately with the available measurements. The estimability index is based on the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound. The study of estimability is used to determine a multisensor-multitarget scenario where several bias estimators are compared with respect to performance using a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation includes alignment, location and sensor biases, and all sensors are affected. The estimators are evaluated in sensor independent coordinates and master sensor coordinates. Two Kalman Filter (KF) based estimators are used as references. A lower bound is represented by a KF where the bias values are known, while an upper bound is represented by a KF where the measurement noise is increased to reflect the biases present. The alignment, location and sensor biases contain three elements each, to a total of nine bias values to estimate per sensor. The UBE performs well (below the upper bound) in sensor independent coordinates when one of the sensor bias values are removed from the simulation, estimating eight bias values per sensor. Performance is close to the lower bound when the location bias only is removed, yielding six bias values per sensor. In master sensor coordinates the ABE has the best performance. However a simplified version has almost identical performance. It is called the Relative Bias Estimator (RBE), and it neglects the biases of the master sensor. This is a popular assumption in the literature, and this study confirms that this simplification should be preferred in an implementation. Possible extensions of this work are explored. First curved target motion is explored by letting the target move at constant altitude above the Earth. The curvature of the trajectory results in increased bias estimability. However, observing this curvature requires observing the target for a long time with high accuracy. This is challenging in practice, and therefore this path was not explored further. Second, extending the application to Air Traffic Control (ATC) is considered. At airports radars typically produce 2 D measurements, so to extend the developed 3 D bias estimators it is necessary to incorporate altitude measurements from the aircraft Mode C transponders with these 2 D measurements. The altitude measurements are quantized and received with a coarse resolution which may {{have a negative impact on}} bias estimator performance since the vertical velocity estimate becomes unstable. Several estimators are developed to estimate altitude and vertical velocity, and these are tested on real measurement data for a performance comparison. The main contribution is the use of the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based estimators on quantized real world measurements. The UKF produces the best performance for long term altitude predictions, meaning that its vertical velocity estimate is the most stable...|$|E
