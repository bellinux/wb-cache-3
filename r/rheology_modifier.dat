40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the EM- 31 Rheological Modifiers and Wetting Agents program is to utilize commercially available rheology modifiers to increase the solids fraction of radioactive sludge based waste streams, resulting {{in an increase in}} throughput and decreasing the overall processing time. The program first investigates the impact of rheology modifiers on slurry simulants and then utilizes the most effective rheology modifiers on radioactive slurries. The work presented in this document covers the initial investigation of <b>rheology</b> <b>modifier</b> testing with simulants. This task is supported by both the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The SRNL EM- 31 task, for this year, was to investigate the use of rheology modifiers on simulant Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) melter feeds. The task is to determine, based on the impact of the <b>rheology</b> <b>modifier,</b> if there are rheology modifiers that could reduce the water content of the slurry going to the DWPF melter, hence increasing the melt rate by decreasing the water loading. The <b>rheology</b> <b>modifier</b> in essence would allow a higher solids content slurry to have the same type of rheology or pumpability of a lower solids slurry. The modifiers selected in this report were determined based on previous modifiers used in high level waste melter feed simulants, on-going testing performed by counterparts at PNNL, and experiences gain through use of modifiers in other Department of Energy (DOE) processes such as grout processing. There were 12 rheology modifiers selected for testing, covering both organic and inorganic types and they were tested at four different concentrations for a given melter feed. Five different DWPF melter feeds were available and there was adequate material in one of the melter feeds to increase the solids concentration, resulting in a total of six simulants for testing. The mass of melter feed available in each simulant was not adequate for testing each <b>rheology</b> <b>modifier,</b> hence based on the changes in rheology for a given <b>rheology</b> <b>modifier,</b> rheology modifiers were either dropped or added between simulants. Three rheology modifiers were used on all simulants. The results from this testing indicate that citric acid or polycarboxylate based rheology modifiers are the most effective in reducing the yield stress, by as much as 70 % at the higher <b>rheology</b> <b>modifier</b> additions and were effective on most of the tested simulants. These rheology modifiers are organic, hence the can also be used as reductants in melter operations. The most effective non-organic rheology modifiers, sodium metasilicate reduced the yield stress by 10 %. It is recommended that both citric acid and commercially available polycarboxylate rheology modifiers be further investigated. Different molecular weight polycarboxylates and different types of polycarboxylates used in other industries must be considered. These polycarboxylates are extensively utilized in the cement, ceramic, and water treatment processes, hence readily available. Future work on DWPF melter feeds involving rheology modifiers should include, assuming the present method of processing sludge through DPWF does not change, is: (1) Investigate the use of polycarboxylate in various processes and procure polycarboxylates for testing. Limit <b>rheology</b> <b>modifier</b> selection and future testing between four and eight different types. (2) Test rheology modifiers on at least two different chemical types or bounding DWPF SME product simulants.

40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{depositing}} mesoporous silica films directly on macroporous a-alumina supports is reported. A polymeric silica sol was prepared by hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate in acid propanol in presence of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide as template. The rheology of the sol was changed by a modified urea-based thixotropic agent, {{which was used}} in a concentration range between 2 % and 10 % on volume.

SRNL has performed extensive testing of <b>rheology</b> <b>modifiers</b> for use with Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) simulated melter feed - a high undissolved solids (UDS) mixture of simulated Savannah River Site (SRS) Tank Farm sludge, nitric and formic acids, and glass frit. A much smaller set of evaluations with Hanford simulated waste have also been completed. This report summarizes past work and recommends modifiers for further evaluation with Hanford simulated wastes followed by verification with actual waste samples. Based on the review of available data, a few compounds/systems appear to hold the most promise. For all types of evaluated simulated wastes (caustic Handford tank waste and DWPF processing samples with pH ranging from slightly acidic to slightly caustic), polyacrylic acid had positive impacts on rheology. Citric acid also showed improvement in yield stress {{on a wide variety}} of samples. It is recommended that both polyacrylic acid and citric acid be further evaluated as <b>rheology</b> <b>modifiers</b> for Hanford waste. These materials are weak organic acids with the following potential issues: The acidic nature of the modifiers may impact waste pH, if added in very large doses. If pH is significantly reduced by the modifier addition, dissolution of UDS and increased corrosion of tanks, piping, pumps, and other process equipment could occur. Smaller shifts in pH could reduce aluminum solubility, which would be expected to increase the yield stress of the sludge. Therefore, it is expected that use of an acidic modifier would be limited to concentrations that do not appreciably change the pH of the waste; Organics are typically reductants and could impact glass REDOX if not accounted for in the reductant addition calculations; Stability of the modifiers in a caustic, radioactive environment is not known, but some of the modifiers tested were specifically designed to withstand caustic conditions; These acids will add to the total organic carbon content of the wastes. Radiolytic decomposition of the acids could result in organic and hydrogen gas generation. These potential impacts must be addressed in future studies with simulants representative of real waste and finally with tests using actual waste based on the rheology differences seen between SRS simulants and actual waste. The only non-organic modifier evaluated was sodium metasilicate. Further evaluation of this modifier is recommended if a reducing modifier is a concern...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT THE EFFECTS OF COLOR CONCENTRATES ON THE RHEOLOGY OF TINT BASES Douglas James Herrick Waterborne {{coatings}} are formulated with {{a number}} of different ingredients; water, latex polymers, pigments, surfactants, dispersants, defoamers, biocides, coalescing aids, and <b>rheology</b> <b>modifiers</b> or thickeners. <b>Rheology</b> <b>modifiers</b> are necessary in order to improve the physical properties of the coating before, during, and after application to a substrate. There are two kinds of <b>rheology</b> <b>modifiers</b> used in waterborne coatings; associative thickeners and non-associative thickeners. Coatings formulated with associative thickeners are quite sensitive to coating variations; the slightest change in the formulation has profound effects on the rheology of the coating. The opposite is true for coatings formulated with non-associative thickeners, where the rheology of the coating is not affected by minor changes in the formulation. The rheological properties of coatings are most influenced by the latex, thickener, and surfactant components of the coating. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} most ideal balance of rheological properties come from using associative thickeners. However, when waterborne coatings with associative thickeners are tinted with colorants containing high levels of surfactants they exhibit a significant decrease in viscosity. This change in viscosity results in poor sag resistance, poor brush loading, and may also cause a reduction in tint strength of the coating. In this work, the effect of tinting paints with six different colorants on the viscosity of the paint was studied for four different paint formulations: a pastel base and a deeptone base formulated with hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC-type) non-associative thickeners, and a pastel base and a deeptone base formulated with hydrophobically-modified, ethoxylated polyurethane (HEUR-type) associative thickeners. Gloss values and tinting strengths were obtained in accordance with ASTM methods D 523 - 08 and D 4838 - 88. In addition, dynamic stress and frequency sweeps were taken in order to study the effect of colorant addition on the viscoelastic properties of each sample. Colorant addition had little to no effects on the viscosity of the bases formulated with HEC thickeners, while there was a dramatic decrease in viscosity upon colorant addition to the bases with HEUR thickeners. Similar results were observed in the viscoelastic property analysis: little to no effects on the elastic and viscous moduli was seen with the tinted coatings formulated with the non-associative thickeners, while both the elastic and viscous moduli decreased for the coatings formulated with associative thickeners. A few of the deeptone bases showed increased moduli upon tinting compared to the parent deeptone base. The addition of colorant resulted in a decrease in tinting strength and an increase in gloss for those samples with associative thickeners, while the opposite was found for those samples with non-associative thickeners...|$|R

Development of a coating with one coat hide {{capability}} is a pinnacle achievement for paint formulators as {{it has the potential}} to save consumers both time and money. One coat paints already exist on the market, but they are limited in color, coverage, and often have many disclaimers. Work done was part of a project initiated by ChemoursTM Titanium Technologies. The goal of the project presented in this article was to create an interior flat, white latex paint that yields a spread rate of greater than 400 ft 2 /gal., which is advertised by many below critical pigment volume concentration (CPVC) commercial paints. In order to achieve this goal, an above CPVC paint with a high TiO 2 content was created and continuously improved. Improvement of the formulation involved numerous experimental variations including adjustments to the hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) molecular weight, dispersant chemistry, latex chemistry, TiO 2 concentration, extender package, and <b>rheology</b> <b>modifier</b> type. The sheen value, relative light scattering, and spread rate were the main measurements conducted in order to judge formulation improvement. Complications with the spread rate procedure forced its adaptation in order to collect less variable data with the high density, shear thinning formulations. It was found that shorter opacity charts yielded more precise spread rate data than the longer opacity charts. An attempt at correlating rheology with sheen development resulted in the conclusion that the pigment and extender particle package is the greatest driving factor behind sheen reduction. The <b>rheology</b> <b>modifier</b> type and dispersant chemistry did not affect the flatness of the paint nearly as much.
