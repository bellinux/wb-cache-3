The skin hypersensitivity persisted for at least 8 weeks, whereas the leukocytic hypersensitivity generally waned rather rapidly. The leukocytic hypersensitivity reappeared in the infected rabbits that had developed this hypersensitivity. However, it did not reappear on reimmunization with living streptococci of the type originally employed, whereas it did reappear with living but not heat-killed streptococci of another M type...|$|R

40|$|Human and <b>rabbit</b> <b>red</b> blood cells, {{separated}} into "young" and "old" age groups by differential flotation on phthalate esters, were fixed with glutaraldehyde and labeled with colloidal ferric oxide. Electron micrographs of thin sections of young cells showed a uniform and dense depostion of positive iron particles. Old cells showed particles deposited irregularly, leaving unlabeled gaps on the membrane surface. Red cells incubated with 10 units/ml receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) demonstrate a reduced labeling, {{similar to that}} of old cells. After neuraminic acid had been removed from red cells by 20 units/ml RDE, no iron particles were found on membrane surfaces. The different labeling of young, old, and RDE-treated human and <b>rabbit</b> <b>red</b> cells was correlated with their electric mobility and agglutinability by poly-L-lysine. The contradiction between the apparent similarity in charge density of human and <b>rabbit</b> <b>red</b> cells as estimated by density of iron particles and the markedly lower electric mobility of <b>rabbit</b> <b>red</b> cells is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Intravenous {{immunization}} of New Zealand <b>red</b> <b>rabbits</b> with streptococcal group-specific {{bacterial vaccines}} yielded sera which possessed markedly elevated γ-globulin.

The bulk of this γ-globulin, identified as γG-globulin, was homogeneous by zone electrophoresis and of specificity {{directed against the}} Group A-variant carbohydrate antigen. L chains isolated from specific antibody obtained from an immune precipitate were distributed as a single band on starch gel electrophoresis, whereas the normal γ-globulin traveled as a diffuse smear. These {{data suggest that the}} rabbit streptococcal Group A-variant antibodies possess a limited range of physicochemical properties and electrophoretic mobility compared to that generally observed for the normal complement of γ-globulin...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} amplify the {{description}} of the prolytic loss of K from human erythrocytes (Ponder, 1947 a) by adding a description of the behavior of the cells with respect to Na, the other important cation of the system. The movement of Na has not received much attention in the systems in which a prolytic loss of K has been shown to occur (lysis of <b>rabbit</b> <b>red</b> ceils by saponin and several other lysins, Davson and Danielli, 1938; lysis of <b>rabbit</b> <b>red</b> cells by rose bengal, Davson and Ponder, 1940; and lysis of the red cells of several mammals by hypotonic saline, Davson, 1937). The loss of K from <b>rabbit</b> <b>red</b> cells into hypotonic NaC 1 has been described as being virtually unaccompanied by a movement of Na in the opposite direction (Davson, 1937), but it willappear below that a relatively large amount of Na enters human red cells when the prolytic loss of K is brought about by lysins such as sodium taurocholate and by sphering agents such as distearyl lecithin.
