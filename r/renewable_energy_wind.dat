25|$|Conventional hydroelectricity, biomass and {{geothermal}} {{are completely}} dispatchable as {{each has a}} store of potential energy; wind and solar production are typically without storage and can be decreased, but not dispatched, other than when nature provides. Between wind and solar, solar has a more variable daily cycle than wind, but is more predictable in daylight hours than wind. Like solar, tidal energy varies between on and off cycles through each day, unlike solar there is no intermittentcy, tides are available every day without fail. Biofuel and biomass involve multiple steps {{in the production of}} energy – growing plants, harvesting, processing, transportation, storage and burning to create heat for electricity, transportation or space heating. In the combined power plant used by the University of Kassel to simulate using 100% <b>renewable</b> <b>energy,</b> <b>wind</b> farms and solar farms were supplemented as needed by hydrostorage and biomass to follow the electricity demand.|$|E
