The positive leader end presented a single channel, brighter and slower than the negative end. On the other side, the negative end was branched, less bright and twice as fast as the positive end. The attachment of one of the negative channels with a pre-existing intra-cloud channel showed that the polarity reversal point in the bidirectional leader remained fixed.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{explains}} the force {{induced by the}} electrostatic field on the electron as a <b>recoil</b> force. The <b>starting</b> point is the hypothesis that in the dynamic equilibrium with the vacuum, the electron simultaneously absorbs and emitts energy. With no external electrostatic field the radiation patterns of absorption and emission {{are assumed to be}} isotropic. The external electrostatic field induces anisotropy of the emission resulting in a recoil force. The paper presents a theoretical description of this force using a model of the angular power density pattern of the emission {{in the form of an}} ellipsoid. Calculations show that the total radiated power is extremely high. This radiation is compared with the electromagnetic radiation of the electron on the Bohr orbit in the idealized hydrogen atom. An analogous problem for gravitational forces is presented. 1...|$|R

40|$|High {{resistivity}} silicon {{with different}} concentrations of the impurities oxygen and carbon were irradiated with neutrons and charged particles. The DLTS method {{is used to}} determine the defect parameters. During irradiation of silicon with particles lattice atoms are displaced and the primary defects silicon interstitials and vacancies form the impurity defects Ci, CiCs, CiOi and V Oi. In the dense displacement regions mainly divacancies V V are formed. The radiation induced defects change the macroscopic parameters of silicon detectors. During irradiation with neutrons mainly clusters are created. During irradiation with charged particles the generation of single isolated displacements is enhanced due to Coulomb scattering. This is main difference between irradiation damage after charged particle and neutron irradiation. The higher radiation tolerance of oxygen enriched silicon after charged particle irradiation is related to the higher introduction rates of impurity defects, because only the reaction kinetic of point defects is influenced by the impurity content. The cluster damage is less particle dependent and the threshold energy at which a <b>recoiled</b> silicon atom <b>starts</b> to create a cluster is estimated to be 300 eV...|$|R
40|$|Frogs' {{outstanding}} jumping ability {{has been}} associated with a high power output from the leg extensor muscles. Two main theories have emerged to explain the high power output of the frog leg extensor muscles, either (i) the contractile conditions of all leg extensor muscles are optimized in terms of muscle length and speed of shortening, or (ii) maximal power is achieved through a dynamic catch mechanism that uncouples fibre shortening from the corresponding muscle-tendon unit shortening. As in vivo instantaneous power generation in frog hind limb muscles during jumping has never been measured directly, it is hard to distinguish between the two theories. In this study, we determined the instantaneous variable power output of the plantaris longus (PL) of Lithobates pipiens (also known as Rana pipiens), by directly measuring the in vivo force, length change, and speed of muscle and fibre shortening in near maximal jumps. Fifteen near maximal jumps (> 50 cm in horizontal distance) were analyzed. High instantaneous peak power in PL (536 ± 47 W/kg) was achieved by optimizing the contractile conditions in terms of the force-length but not the force-velocity relationship, and by a dynamic catch mechanism that decouples fascicle shortening from muscle-tendon unit shortening. We also found that the extra-muscular free tendon likely amplifies the peak power output of the PL by modulating fascicle shortening length and shortening velocity for optimum power output, but not by releasing stored energy through recoiling as the tendon only <b>started</b> <b>recoiling</b> after peak PL power had been achieved...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) has {{increased}} dramatically in size and scope {{over the past two}} decades. Application areas for AUVs are numerous and varied; from deep sea exploration, to pipeline surveillance to mine clearing. However, one limiting factor with the current technology is the duration of missions that can be undertaken and one contributing factor to this is the efficiency of the propulsion system, which is usually based on marine propellers. As fish are highly efficient swimmers greater propulsive efficiency may be possible by mimicking their fish tail propulsion system. The main concept behind this work was therefore to investigate whether a biomimetic fish-like propulsion system is a viable propulsion system for an underwater vehicle and to determine experimentally the efficiency benefits of using such a system. There have been numerous studies into biomimetic fish like propulsion systems and robotic fish in the past with many claims being made as to the benefits of a fish like propulsion system over conventional marine propulsion systems. These claims include increased efficiency and greater manoeuvrability. However, there is little published experimental data to characterise the propulsive efficiency of a fish like propulsive system. Also, very few direct experimental comparisons have been made between biomimetic and conventional propulsion systems. This work attempts to address these issues by directly comparing experimentally a biomimetic underwater propulsion system to a conventional propulsion system to allow for {{a better understanding of the}} potential benefits of the biomimetic system. This work is split into three parts. Firstly, the design and development of a novel prototype vehicle called the RoboSalmon is covered. This vehicle has a biomimetic tendon drive propulsion system which utilizes one servo motor for actuation and has a suite of onboard sensors and a data logger. The second part of this work focuses on the development of a mathematical model of the RoboSalmon vehicle to allow for a better understanding of the dynamics of the system. Simulation results from this model are compared to the experimental results and show good correlation. The final part of the work presents the experimental results obtained comparing the RoboSalmon prototype with the biomimetic tail system to the propeller and rudder system. These experiments include a study into the straight swimming performance, <b>recoil</b> motion, <b>start</b> up transients and power consumption. For forward swimming the maximum surge velocity of the RoboSalmon was 0. 18 ms- 1 and at this velocity the biomimetic system was found to be more efficient than the propeller system. When manoeuvring the biomimetic system was found to have a significantly reduced turning radius. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the main findings from each aspect of the work, covering the benefits obtained from using the tendon drive system in terms of efficiencies and manoeuvring performance. The limitations of the system are also discussed and suggestions for further work are included. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not come}} to herself, as it were, for several minutes, and then feeling she 'could no longer bear the cab, stopped it, and got out. Where was she? Bond Street! She began, idly, {{wandering}} down its narrow length; the fullest street by day, the emptiest by night. Oh! it had been horrible! Nothing said by any of them--nothing, and yet everything dragged out--of him, of Leila, of herself! She seemed to have no pride or decency left, {{as if she had been}} caught stealing. All her happy exhilaration was gone, leaving a miserable recklessness. Nothing she did was right, nothing turned out well, so what did it all matter? The moonlight flooding down between the tall houses gave her a peculiar heady feeling. [...] "Fey" [...] her father had called her. She laughed. 'But I'm not going home,' she thought. Bored with the street's length; she turned off, and was suddenly in Hanover Square. There was the Church, grey-white, where she had been bridesmaid to a second cousin, when she was fifteen. She seemed to see it all again--her frock, the lilies in her hand, the surplices of the choir, the bride's dress, all moonlight-coloured, and unreal. 'I wonder what's become of her!' she thought. 'He's dead, I expect, like Cyril!' She saw her father's face as he was marrying them, heard his voice: [...] "For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do you part." [...] And the moonlight on the Church seemed to shift and quiver-some pigeons perhaps had been disturbed up there. Then instead of that wedding vision, she saw Monsieur Barra, sitting on his chair, gazing at the floor, and Chica nursing her doll. [...] "All mad, mademoiselle, a little mad. Millions of men with white souls, but all a little tiny bit mad, you know." [...] Then Leila's face came before her, with that look in her eyes. She felt again the hot clasp of Fort's fingers on her wrist, and walked on, rubbing it with the other hand. She turned into Regent Street. The wide curve of the Quadrant swept into a sky of unreal blue, and the orange-shaded lamps merely added to the unreality. 'Love and Chinese lanterns! I should like some coffee,' she thought suddenly. She was quite close to the place where Lavendie had taken her. Should she go in there? Why not? She must go somewhere. She turned into the revolving cage of glass. But no sooner was she imprisoned there than in a flash Lavendie's face of disgust; and the red-lipped women, the green stuff that smelled of peppermint came back, filling her with a rush of dismay. She made the full circle in the revolving cage; and came out into the street again with a laugh. A tall young man in khaki stood there: [...] "Hallo!" [...] he said. [...] "Come in and dance!" [...] She <b>started,</b> <b>recoiled</b> from him and began to walk away as fast as ever she could. She passed a woman whose eyes seemed to scorch her. A woman like a swift vision of ruin with those eyes, and thickly powdered cheeks, and loose red mouth. Noel shuddered and fled along, feeling that her only safety lay in speed. But she could not walk about all night. There would be no train for Kestrel till the morning--and did she really want to go there, and eat her heart out? Suddenly she thought of George. Why should she not go down to him? He would know what was best for her to do. At the foot of the steps below the Waterloo Column she stood still. All was quiet there and empty, the great buildings whitened, the trees blurred and blue; and sweeter air was coming across their flowering tops. The queer [...] "fey" [...] moony sensation was still with her; so that she felt small and light, as if she could have floated through a ring. Faint rims of light showed round the windows of the Admiralty. The war! However lovely the night, however sweet the lilac smelt-that never stopped! She turned away and passed out under the arch, making for the station. The train of the wounded had just come in, and she stood in the cheering crowd watching the ambulances run out. Tears of excited emotion filled her eyes, and trickled down. Steady, smooth, grey, one after the other they came gliding, with a little burst of cheers greeting each one. All were gone now, and she could pass in. She went to the buffet and got a large cup of coffee, and a bun. Then, having noted the time of her early morning train, she sought the ladies' waiting-room, and sitting down in a corner, took out her purse and counted her money. Two pounds fifteen-enough to go to the hotel, if she liked. But, without luggage--it was so conspicuous, and she could sleep in this corner all right, if she wanted. What did girls do who had no money, and no friends to go to? Tucked away in the corner of that empty, heavy, varnished room, she seemed to see the cruelty and hardness of life as she had never before seen it, not even when facing her confinement. How lucky she had been, and was! Everyone was good to her. She had no real want or dangers, to face. But, for women--yes, and men too--who had no one to fall back on, nothing but their own hands and health and luck, it must be awful. That girl whose eyes had scorched her--perhaps she had no one--nothing. And people who were born ill, and the millions of poor women, like those whom she had gone visiting with Gratian sometimes in the poorer streets of her father's parish--for the first time she seemed to really know and feel the sort of lives they led. And then, Leila's face came back to her once more--Leila whom she had robbed. And the worst of it was, that, alongside her remorseful sympathy, she felt a sort of satisfaction. She could not help his not loving Leila, she could not help it if he loved herself! And he did--she knew it! To feel that anyone loved her was so comforting. But it was all awful! And she--the cause of it! And yet--she had never done or said anything to attract him. No! She could not have helped it.|$|R
