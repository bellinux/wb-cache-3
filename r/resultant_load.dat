50|$|A tower {{testing station}} {{is a special}} plant for testing various design for towers for {{transmission}} lines and similar uses. A tower testing station consists of two steel stands and one or more foundations, on which {{a sample of the}} tower can be built. The number of test conditions is normally limited to between six and eight individual cases, with loading condition such as reduced wind and ice. The towers to be tested are erected on rigid foundation and the wire ropes attached to the loading point required. Loading may either be applied by 'dead' weights using scale pans, winches or hydraulic rams. In the latter cases a load cell or dyamometer is placed in the rigging adjacent to the point of loading at the structure. The loading methods induce strain by pulling cables away from the tower to the specified loads. The pulling load is indicated through a strain gauge placed on the pulling point. Loading points on a tower naturally encompasses longitudinal, transverse and vertical components, either as individual or a combined <b>resultant</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E

A mechanics description of loading conditions for a finite plate with a rigid inclusion is first presented. The loading conditions of interest are the <b>resultant</b> <b>loads</b> on the inclusion with respect {{to the center of the}} inclusion in a finite or infinite plate and the surface tractions on the lateral surface of a finite or infinite plate. The surface tractions on the lateral surface of the plate can be decomposed into a load-balanced part and a self-balanced part. The load-balanced part is statically in equilibrium with the <b>resultant</b> <b>loads</b> acting on the inclusion. The self-balanced part can be represented by the <b>resultant</b> <b>loads</b> on the lateral surface of the plate. The <b>resultant</b> <b>loads</b> on the inclusion and the self-balanced <b>resultant</b> <b>loads</b> on the lateral surface are then decomposed into various types of symmetric and anti-symmetric parts. Based on the stress function approach and the Kirchhoff plate theory for linear elastic materials, closed-form in-plane stress, moment and transverse shear force solutions are derived for a plate with a rigid inclusion subjected to various types of <b>resultant</b> <b>loads</b> on the inclusion and various types of <b>resultant</b> <b>loads</b> on the plate lateral surface. Based on the J integral for a strip model, closed-form analytical stress intensity factor solutions for spot welds joining two sheets of equal thickness are derived in terms of the structural stresses around a rigid inclusion in a plate under various types of loading conditions. The closed-form solutions presented in this paper are used as the basis to develop new analytical stress intensity factor solutions for spot welds in various types of specimens presented in a subsequent paper...|$|R
40|$|A primary {{objective}} of the Bureau of Mines geomechanics research program {{is to develop a}} better understanding of support behavior and interaction of supports with the strata so that supports can be more closely engineered to the geological conditions in which they are employed. Four longwall shield supports were instrumented with an eight-transducer instrumentation array to measure leg, canopy capsule, and compression lemniscate link forces from which <b>resultant</b> shield <b>loading</b> was determined. The instrumented supports were monitored over a 4 -month period, producing over 75 shield cycles of <b>resultant</b> shield <b>loading.</b> <b>Resultant</b> <b>loading</b> is the true measure of support resistance, providing both roof-to-floor and face-to-waste support reactions as well as the location of the reaction on the shield canopy. Observed roof support reactions were analyzed, with particular emphasis on horizontal shield loading, since it is the least understood design parameter. Average, peak, and change in shield loading during the mining cycle are discussed.

40|$|The U. s. Bureau of Mines is {{conducting}} research {{to optimize the}} utilization and design of mine roof support systems. This report describes methods to evaluate <b>resultant</b> <b>loading</b> on longwall shields, defined as external resultant vertical and horizontal force acting on the canopy and base. Four models are considered: two rigid-body models, an elastic model, and a numerical model. The rigid-body models equate measured internal shield forces to unknown external <b>resultant</b> shield forces (<b>loads)</b> through rigid-body analysis of static equilibrium requirements. The elastic model develops a solution to shield mechanics by evaluation of the load-displacement relationship and stiffness characteristics of the support structure. The numerical model is a two-dimensional finite-element representation of a shield structure. Model determination of <b>resultant</b> shield <b>loading</b> is compared to controlled loading of a shield in the Bureau's mine roof simulator. Parameters investigated are shield height, canopy contact configuration, canopy and base horizontal constrainment, and boundary conditions imposed by vertical and horizontal shield displacements.

40|$|The term "resultant load vector" {{is defined}} as the {{representation}} of the forces applied to a longwall roof support element by strata activity through a single, quantifiable measure of support resistance. The relatively complex kinematics of the shield structure prohibits determination of support resistance simply from the summation of leg forces. In the research reported in this Bureau of Mines study, the mechanics of the shield structure were evaluated, and a technique was developed whereby the resultant shield loading could be determined by instrumenting supports with pressure transducers and strain gauges to measure leg, canopy capsule, and lemniscate link forces. This technique has been laboratory tested in the Bureau's Mine Roof Simulator. Functional relationships among variables were assessed, and confidence intervals were established for prediction of the <b>resultant</b> <b>load</b> vector parameters. <b>Resultant</b> <b>load</b> measurements were taken on five instrumented shields on an active longwall face in Colorado.

40|$|The {{design of}} an {{instrument}} is described that measures three resultant force components and three resultant moment components {{acting on a}} surface. Within the framework of linear elastostatics of an isotropic homogeneous material the device separates to a given precision the six <b>resultant</b> <b>load</b> components. Sensor paths of finite length are employed. Moreover if fiber-optic differential displacement sensors are used rather than traditional electrical resistance strain gages, the range and sensitivity of the instrument can in principle be improved without sacrificing the device stiffness. The primary reason for these improvements is that a complete solution to the equations of elasticity allows certain displacements to be measured over large distances and be combined to yield all of the <b>resultant</b> <b>load</b> components. These displacement measurements over a long distance accommodates the use of fiber-optic interferometric sensors.

To optimize implant geometry, {{it is necessary to}} consider, not only the prosthesis component design, but also the final configuration of the implanted leg. This means the necessity to consider the specific morphological and functional condition of “that” patient and not only of “that” hip to restore, at best, limb functions. Variations in the length of the implanted limb are frequent; therefore, the variations in the three geometrical features of the hip prosthesis neck, which can affect the restoration of the anatomical symmetry of the limbs, were investigated: (i) neck lengths (LN), between 50. 5 and 64. 5 mm; (ii) cervico-diaphyseal (CD) angle (γ), between 135 and 125 ° and; (iii) anteversion (AV) angle (β), between 0 and 15 °.

Water-quality monitoring often {{is limited to a}} few sites within the stream network at which samples are collected and analysed at some intermittent frequency (e. g. monthly).
