5|$|Improvement {{continued}} in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working <b>reaping</b> <b>machine,</b> developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production {{and the result was}} the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E
25|$|Specifically themed {{exhibitions}} include agricultural {{tools and}} equipment, clothing, toys, musical instruments, and household items. Amongst the preserved machinery is the <b>reaping</b> <b>machine</b> invented by Patrick Bell (1799–1869), the earliest surviving {{example of an}} iron plough invented by James Small (1730–1793) and the best collection of combine harvesters in Europe, mostly housed in an area which can be visited upon request.|$|E
2500|$|... 1814: Thomas Dobbs (actor) invents a <b>reaping</b> <b>machine,</b> which {{consists}} of a circular saw or sickle; the grain is drawn or fed up to the saw {{by means of a}} pair of rollers. This predates William Bell's straw cutting machine.|$|E
60|$|There was a silence, and in {{a growing}} wave of sound the whir of the <b>reaping</b> <b>machines</b> swelled up from the fields beyond the garden and then receded into a remoter hum.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a privilege," [...] I {{declared}} solemnly, [...] "to {{have ever}} known your father! If I only had an idea what he meant about those <b>reaping</b> <b>machines!</b> You couldn't give me a hint, I suppose, Eve?" [...] She shook her head.|$|R
25|$|Between 1850 and 1864 Fowler {{took out}} in his own name and in {{partnership}} with other persons thirty-two patents for ploughs and ploughing apparatus, <b>reaping</b> <b>machines,</b> seed drills, traction engines, slide valves, the laying of electric telegraph cables, {{and the making of}} bricks and tiles.|$|R

60|$|Toward {{the center}} of the field, seated upon a ridiculously {{inadequate}} seat {{on the top of a}} <b>reaping</b> <b>machine,</b> was Mr. Bundercombe. He had divested himself of coat and waistcoat, and was hatless. The perspiration was streaming down his face as he gripped the steering wheel. He was followed by a little crowd of children and sympathizing men, who cheered him all the time.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that there was {{something}} unreal, almost hideous, about the silence which followed. Through the open window there drifted into the room the early morning sounds of an awakening world--the whistling of birds in the shrubberies and upon the lawn, the more distant whir of a <b>reaping</b> <b>machine</b> at work in the cornfields. But between us--silence. I could not move my eyes from her face. There was no anger there, only a slowly dawning horror. She seemed to be looking upon me as a man doomed. I lit a match, and, taking some papers from my pocket, I slowly destroyed them.|$|E
50|$|Patrick Bell of Scotland {{created a}} reaper that used a {{revolving}} reel, cutting knife and canvas conveyor in 1828.

6000|$|The fervent heat, but so {{much more}} endurable in this pure air--the white and pink pond-blossoms, with great {{heart-shaped}} leaves; the glassy waters of the creek, the banks, with dense bushery, and the picturesque beeches and shade and turf; the tremulous, reedy call of some bird from recesses, breaking the warm, indolent, half-voluptuous silence; an occasional wasp, hornet, honey-bee or bumble (they hover near my hands or face, yet annoy me not, nor I them, as they appear to examine, find nothing, and away they go)--the vast space of the sky overhead so clear, and the buzzard up there sailing his slow whirl in majestic spirals and discs; just {{over the surface of}} the pond, two large slate-color'd dragon-flies, with wings of lace, circling and darting and occasionally balancing themselves quite still, their wings quivering all the time, (are they not showing off for my amusement?)--the pond itself, with the sword-shaped calamus; the water snakes--occasionally a flitting blackbird, with red dabs on his shoulders, as he darts slantingly by--the sounds that bring out the solitude, warmth, light and shade--the quawk of some pond duck--(the crickets and grasshoppers are mute in the noon heat, but I hear the song of the first cicadas;)--then at some distance the rattle and whirr of a <b>reaping</b> <b>machine</b> as the horses draw it on a rapid walk through a rye field {{on the opposite side of}} the creek--(what was the yellow or light-brown bird, large as a young hen, with short neck and long-stretch'd legs I just saw, in flapping and awkward flight over there through the trees?)--the prevailing delicate, yet palpable, spicy, grassy, clovery perfume to my nostrils; and over all, encircling all, to my sight and soul, the free space of the sky, transparent and blue--and hovering there in the west, a mass of white-gray fleecy clouds the sailors call [...] "shoals of mackerel"--the sky, with silver swirls like locks of toss'd hair, spreading, expanding--a vast voiceless, formless simulacrum--yet may-be the most real reality and formulator of everything--who knows? ...|$|E

60|$|Here {{he wandered}} {{for a while}} in continual dread of having his pocket picked, seeking <b>reaping</b> <b>machines</b> and {{discovering}} none, till at length he found himself in the gardens, where the electric light display was in full swing. Soon wearying of this, for it was a cold damp night, he made a difficult path to a buffet inside the building, where he sat down at a little table, and devoured some very unpleasant-looking cold beef. Here slumber overcame him, for his weariness was great, and he dozed.|$|R

The railways did provide opportunity too with one Riverside company selling their <b>reaping</b> <b>machines</b> as far afield as Syria and Australia. Similarly, in 1861, a company making baby carriages was set up. These prams were exported to Canada, South America, India and South Africa.|$|R

50|$|Agricultural {{cultivation}} using {{horse collar}} leveraged plows (3000 years ago) increased cereal grain productivity yields, {{as did the}} use of seed drills which replaced broadcasting sowing of seed in the 18th century.

60|$|Madame de Melbain {{was silent}} for several moments. She seemed to be thinking. Louise's face was expressionless.

From below in the valley came the faint whir of the <b>reaping</b> <b>machines,</b> from the rose garden a murmur of bees. But between the two women and the man there was silence--silence which lasted so long that Monsieur Jules, who was watching from a window, called softly upon all the saints of his acquaintance {{to explain to him}} of what nature was this mystery, which seemed to be developing, as it were, under his own surveillance.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} any pipe organ in this State was in 1839, when a Mr. John Richmond who purchased property at Prospect, brought out an organ {{and placed it}} in his home called Prospect House. The next reference is in 1846, when an organ was built in South Australia by one Samuel Marshall. Incidentally Mr. Marshall began making <b>reaping</b> <b>machines</b> in 1839: then in 1846 he started to build a pipe organ. The organ was temporarily erected in the Pulteney Street School, and later on a gallery in the old St. John's Church, the organ and gallery costing £300. The opening of the organ look place in July, 1848, the organist on this occasion being a Mr. Bennett, who was at that time a business associate of Mr. Marshall.|$|R
