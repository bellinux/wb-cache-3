25|$|The Porton Down {{analysis}} by James R. Riches and his colleagues, , showed that while fentanyl or 3-methyl fentanyl were {{absent from the}} urine of one survivor and residues of the agent in the clothing of two other British survivors, the veterinary large animal sedative drug carfentanil and anesthetic agent <b>remifentanil</b> were identified by liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry in one hostage's urine and on the clothing of three hostages who had returned to Britain after the hostage rescue. The authors concluded that carfentanil and <b>remifentanil</b> were used as a mixture in the chemical agent employed by Russian troops to subdue the Chechen terrorists and hostages at the Barricade Theater, perhaps suspended in the anesthetic agent halothane.|$|E
25|$|Infrequent adverse {{reactions}} in patients taking opioids for pain relief include: dose-related respiratory depression (especially with more potent opioids), confusion, hallucinations, delirium, urticaria, hypothermia, bradycardia/tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, headache, urinary retention, ureteric or biliary spasm, muscle rigidity, myoclonus (with high doses), and flushing (due to histamine release, except fentanyl and <b>remifentanil).</b>|$|E
2500|$|... the {{toxicology}} {{in humans}} of the veterinary drug carfentanil and the perioperative anesthetic drug <b>remifentanil</b> when used as aerosolized agents ("gases" [...] {{within the military}} sense of the word) weren't studied closely enough.

50|$|<b>Remifentanil</b> is metabolized to a {{compound}} (<b>remifentanil</b> acid) which has 1/4600th {{the potency of}} the parent compound.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remifentanil</b> is a potent, short-acting {{synthetic}} {{opioid analgesic}} drug. It {{is given to}} patients during surgery to relieve pain and {{as an adjunct to}} an anaesthetic. <b>Remifentanil</b> is used for sedation as well as combined with other medications for use in general anesthesia. The use of <b>remifentanil</b> has made possible the use of high-dose opioid and low-dose hypnotic anesthesia, due to synergism between <b>remifentanil</b> and various hypnotic drugs and volatile anesthetics.|$|E
50|$|Due to its quick {{metabolism}} and short effects, <b>remifentanil</b> {{has opened up}} new possibilities in anesthesia. When <b>remifentanil</b> is used together with a hypnotic (i.e. one that produces sleep) {{it can be used}} in relative high doses. This is because <b>remifentanil</b> will be rapidly eliminated from the blood plasma on termination of the <b>remifentanil</b> infusion, hence the effects of the drug will quickly dissipate even after very long infusions. Owing to synergism between <b>remifentanil</b> and hypnotic drugs (such as propofol) the dose of the hypnotic can be substantially reduced. This leads often to more hemodynamic stability during surgery and a quicker post-operative recovery time.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other {{synthetic}} opioids {{which are}} hepatically metabolized, <b>remifentanil</b> has an ester linkage which undergoes rapid hydrolysis by non-specific tissue and plasma esterases. This means that accumulation {{does not occur}} with <b>remifentanil</b> and its context-sensitive half-life remains at 4 minutes after a 4-hour infusion.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of <b>remifentanil,</b> most short-acting hypnotics and amnestics faced issues with prolonged use, where accumulation would result in unfavorable lingering effects during post-operative recovery. <b>Remifentanil</b> was designed to serve as a strong anesthetic with an ultra-short and predictable duration that would not have accumulation issues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remifentanil</b> {{is used as}} an opioid {{analgesic}} that has a rapid onset and rapid recovery time. It has been used effectively during craniotomies, spinal surgery, cardiac surgery, and gastric bypass surgery. While opiates function similarly, with respect to analgesia, the pharmacokinetics of <b>remifentanil</b> allows for quicker post-operative recovery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remifentanil,</b> being a μ-receptor agonist, {{functions}} {{like other}} μ-receptor agonists, such as morphine and codeine, {{and can cause}} euphoria and {{has the potential for}} abuse. However, due to its rapid metabolism and short-acting half-life the likelihood of becoming abused is quite low. Nevertheless, there have been some documentations of <b>remifentanil</b> abuse.|$|E
50|$|In {{combination}} with propofol, <b>remifentanil</b> {{is used for}} anesthesia of patients undergoing Electroconvulsive therapy.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} at the British chemical and biological defense laboratories at Porton Down found carfentanil and <b>remifentanil</b> in clothing from two British survivors of the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis and urine from a third survivor. The team concluded that the Russian military used an aerosol mist of carfentanil and <b>remifentanil</b> to subdue Chechen hostage takers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remifentanil</b> is {{approximately}} twice as potent as fentanyl, and 100-200 times as potent as morphine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remifentanil</b> is {{patented}} by Glaxo Wellcome Inc. and was FDA approved on July 12, 1996.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remifentanil</b> {{has been}} used with some success to {{circumvent}} naltrexone in patients who {{are in need of}} pain management.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remifentanil</b> is {{relatively}} context insensitive. Fentanyl and thiopental {{are examples of}} drugs which have significant context-sensitive changes in their half-life.|$|E
50|$|The Porton Down {{analysis}} by James R. Riches and his colleagues, Analysis of Clothing and Urine from Moscow Theatre Siege Casualties Reveals Carfentanil and <b>Remifentanil</b> Use, showed that while fentanyl or 3-methyl fentanyl were {{absent from the}} urine of one survivor and residues of the agent in the clothing of two other British survivors, the veterinary large animal sedative drug carfentanil and anesthetic agent <b>remifentanil</b> were identified by liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry in one hostage's urine and on the clothing of three hostages who had returned to Britain after the hostage rescue.

50|$|It is {{administered}} {{in the form}} <b>remifentanil</b> hydrochloride and in adults is given as an intravenous infusion in doses ranging from 0.1 microgram per kilogram per minute to 0.5 (µg/kg)/min. Children may require higher infusion rates (up to 1.0 (µg/kg)/min). The clinically useful infusion rates are 0.025-0.1 (µg/kg)/min for sedation (rates adjusted to age of patient, severity of their illness and invasiveness of surgical procedure). Small amounts of other sedative medications are usually co-administered with <b>remifentanil</b> to produce sedation. Clinically useful infusion rates in general anesthesia vary but are usually 0.1-1 µg/kg/min.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remifentanil</b> is a Schedule II {{narcotic}} {{controlled substance}} in the United States with a DEA ACSCN of 9739 and a 2013 annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 3750 grams, unchanged from the prior year.|$|E
50|$|Nausea {{can occur}} as {{a side effect of}} <b>remifentanil,</b> however, it is usually {{transient}} in nature due to the drug's short half-life which rapidly removes it from the patient's circulation once the infusion is terminated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remifentanil</b> can be {{administered}} {{as part of}} an anesthesia technique called TIVA (Total Intravenous Anesthesia) using computer controlled infusion pumps in a process called target controlled infusion or TCI. A target plasma concentration is entered as ng/ml into the pump, which calculates its infusion rate according to patient factors like age and weight. Induction levels of 4 ng/ml are commonly used, but it generally varies between 3-8 ng/ml. For certain surgical procedures that produce particularly strong stimuli a level of up to 15 ng/ml might be needed. The relatively short context-sensitive half-life of <b>Remifentanil</b> allows the desired blood plasma level to be achieved quickly and also for the same reason, recovery occurs quickly.|$|E
50|$|Scientists at Britain's {{chemical}} and biological defense labs at Porton Down analyzed residue from the clothing of three hostages and the urine of one hostage rescued during the Moscow theater hostage crisis and found two chemical derivatives of fentanyl, <b>remifentanil</b> and carfentanil.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Remifentanil</b> is a {{specific}} μ-receptor agonist. [...] Hence, it causes a reduction in sympathetic nervous system tone, respiratory depression and analgesia. The drug's effects include a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate and arterial pressure and respiratory rate and tidal volume. Muscle rigidity is sometimes noted.|$|E
50|$|Analeptics {{can be used}} to {{increase}} the speed of recovery from propofol, <b>remifentanil,</b> and sevoflurane. In clinical settings, analeptics such as Doxapram have been used to help patients recover from anesthesia better, as well as removing some of the potential negative side effects of potent anesthetics.|$|E
5000|$|The use of <b>remifentanil</b> and carfentanil, {{derivatives}} of {{the drug}} fentanyl by Russian authorities in the 2002 Moscow hostage crisis [...] is arguably a real-life use of a [...] "knockout gas" [...] which, while bringing the crisis to an end, also caused undesired fatalities among the hostages.|$|E
50|$|Authors of a {{previous}} paper in the Annals of Emergency Medicine surmised from the available evidence that the Moscow emergency services had not been informed {{of the use of}} the agent, but were instructed to bring opioid antagonists. Not knowing to expect hundreds of patients exposed to high doses of strong opioids, the emergency workers did not bring enough naloxone or naltrexone (the two most commonly-used opioid antagonists) to counteract the carfentanil and <b>remifentanil</b> and save the lives of many of the victims. 125 people exposed to the gas used in the rescue attempt are confirmed to have died from both respiratory failure and aerosol inhalation during the incident. The authors state that, assuming carfentanil and <b>remifentanil</b> were the only active ingredients of the knockout gas, that the worst danger to the theater victims would have been apnea (loss of breathing), and that mechanical ventilation and/or treatment with opioid antagonists could have saved many lives.|$|E

50|$|The {{therapeutic}} index varies widely among substances, even within a related group. For instance, among the opioid analgesics, <b>remifentanil</b> {{is the most}} forgiving, offering a {{therapeutic index}} of 33,000:1 while diazepam, a benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant has a less-forgiving index of 100:1 and morphine, a sedative, antidepressant, and analgesic of herbal origin (genus Papaver) has an index of 70:1 (which, however, is still considered very safe).|$|E
5000|$|While {{alfentanil}} {{tends to}} cause fewer cardiovascular complications than other similar {{drugs such as}} fentanyl and <b>remifentanil,</b> it tends to give stronger respiratory depression and so requires careful monitoring of breathing and vital signs. Almost exclusively used by anesthesia providers during portions of a case where quick, fast acting (though not long lasting) pain control is needed (i.e. during a nerve block, head pinning etc..) Alfentanil {{is administered by the}} [...] (injected) route for fast onset of effects and precise control of dosage.|$|E
50|$|Pedro Cuatrecasas {{is known}} for the {{invention}} and development of affinity chromatography, a process utilized within the Aethlon HemopurifierTM. He {{was involved in the}} discovery, development and marketing registration of more than forty medicines. Some of those medicines include: zidovudine (AZT, AIDS), acyclovir (Zovirax, anti-herpes), permethrin (Rid, head and body lice), bupropion (Wellbutrin, antidepressant), colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf, infant acute respiratory distress), <b>remifentanil</b> (Ultiva, analgesic/anesthetic), sumatriptan (Imigran, migraine), salmeterol (Serement, asthma), tacrine (Cognex, Alzheimers), gabapentin (Neurontin, epilepsy and neuropathic pain), troglitazone (Rezulin, diabetes), and atorvastatin (Lipitor, cholesterol lowering).|$|E
50|$|In Hong Kong, <b>remifentanil</b> is {{regulated}} under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. It {{can only be}} used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined $10000 (HKD). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $1,000,000 (HKD) fine and/or 7 years of jail time.|$|E
50|$|Wooden chest, {{also called}} {{fentanyl}} chest wall rigidity syndrome, {{is a rare}} side effect of synthetic opioids such as Fentanyl, Sulfentanil, Alfentanil, <b>Remifentanil.</b> It results in a generalised increase in skeletal muscle tone. The mechanism {{is thought to be}} via increased dopamine release and decreased GABA release in the nerves of the substantia nigra/striatum. The effect is most pronounced on the chest wall muscles and can lead to impaired ventilation. The condition is most commonly in anaesthesia where rapid and high doses of these drugs are given intravenously.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, Riches et al. found {{evidence}} from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of extracts of clothing from two British survivors, and urine {{from a third}} survivor, that the aerosol was a mixture carfentanil and <b>remifentanil</b> the exact proportions of which they could not determine. Assuming that these were the only active constituents (which has not been verified by the Russian military), the primary acute toxic effect to the theatre victims would have been opioid-induced apnea; in this case mechanical ventilation and/or treatment with naltrexone, the specific antidote for poisoning with carfentanil in humans would have been life-saving for many or all victims.|$|E
5000|$|Kolokol-1 (Колокол meaning [...] "bell") is a {{synthetic}} opioid developed {{for use as}} an aerosolizable incapacitating agent. The exact chemical structure {{has not yet been}} revealed by the Russian government. It was originally thought by some sources to be a derivative of the potent opioid fentanyl, most probably 3-methylfentanyl dissolved in an inhalational anaesthetic as an organic solvent. However, independent analysis of residues on the Barricade Theater hostage crisis hostages' clothing or in one hostage's urine found no fentanyl or 3-methyl fentanyl. Two much more potent and shorter-acting agents, carfentanil (a large animal tranquilizer) and <b>remifentanil</b> (a surgical painkiller) were found in the samples. They concluded that the agent used in the Barricade Theater hostage rescue contained two fentanyl derivatives much stronger than fentanyl itself, sprayed in an aerosol mist.|$|E
50|$|The {{available}} data suggests a relation between ICU volume {{and quality of}} care for mechanically ventilated patients. After adjustment for severity of illnesses, demographic variables, and characteristics of different ICUs (including staffing by intensivists), higher ICU staffing {{was significantly associated with}} lower ICU and hospital mortality rates. A ratio of 2 patients to 1 nurse is recommended for a medical ICU, which contrasts to the ratio of 4:1 or 5:1 typically seen on medical floors. This varies from country to country, though; e.g., in Australia and the United Kingdom most ICUs are staffed on a 2:1 basis (for high-dependency patients who require closer monitoring or more intensive treatment than a hospital ward can offer) or on a 1:1 basis for patients requiring very intensive support and monitoring; for example, a patient on a mechanical ventilator with associated anaesthetics or sedation such as propofol, midazolam and use of strong analgesics such as morphine, fentanyl and/or <b>remifentanil.</b>|$|E
