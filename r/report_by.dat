30|$|To {{calculate}} {{recall and}} precision, we considered that true positives are instances (classes or methods) {{present in the}} code smell reference list that are also <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> the tool being assessed.

Finally, true negatives are instances that are not present in the reference list and were also not <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> the tool.
