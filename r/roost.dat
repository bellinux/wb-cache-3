5|$|Egyptian {{vultures}} <b>roost</b> communally {{on large}} trees, buildings or on cliffs. <b>Roost</b> sites are usually chosen {{close to a}} dump site or other suitable foraging area. In Spain and Morocco, summer roosts are formed mainly by immature birds. The favourite <b>roost</b> trees tended to be large dead pines. The number of adults at the <b>roost</b> increases towards June. It is thought that breeding adults {{may be able to}} forage more efficiently by joining the <b>roost</b> and following others to the best feeding areas. Breeding birds that failed to raise young may also join the non-breeding birds at the <b>roost</b> during June.|$|E
5|$|House sparrows {{sleep with}} the bill tucked {{underneath}} the scapular feathers. Outside of the reproductive season, they often <b>roost</b> communally in trees or shrubs. Much communal chirping occurs {{before and after the}} birds settle in the <b>roost</b> in the evening, as well as before the birds leave the <b>roost</b> in the morning. Some congregating sites separate from the <b>roost</b> may be visited by the birds prior to settling in for the night.|$|E
5|$|Cape sparrows {{prefer to}} <b>roost</b> in nests, and while {{wandering}} {{outside of the}} breeding season, birds in uncultivated areas <b>roost</b> socially in old nests or dense bushes. In farmland and towns, Cape sparrows build special nests for roosting, lined more poorly than breeding nests but incorporating a greater quantity of insulating material.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{types of}} day <b>roosts</b> {{utilized}} by Indiana bats {{have been identified}} as primary and alternate <b>roosts.</b> Primary <b>roosts</b> typically support more than 30 bats at a time and are used most often by a maternity colony. Trees that support smaller numbers of Indiana bats from the same maternity colony are designated as alternate <b>roosts.</b> In cases where smaller maternity colonies are present in an area, primary <b>roosts</b> may be defined as those used for more than 2 days at a time by each bat, while alternate <b>roosts</b> are generally used less than 2 consecutive days. Maternity colonies may use up to 3 primary <b>roosts</b> and up to 33 alternate <b>roosts</b> [...] in a single season. Reproductively active females frequently switch <b>roosts</b> to find optimal <b>roosting</b> conditions. When switching between day <b>roosts,</b> Indiana bats may travel as little as 23 feet (7 m) or as far as 3.6 miles (5.8km). In general, moves are relatively short and typically less than 0.6 mile (1km).|$|R

50|$|Oilbirds are nocturnal. During the day {{the birds}} rest on cave ledges and leave at night to find fruit outside the cave. It was once thought that oilbirds only <b>roosted</b> in caves, and indeed never saw daylight, but studies using GPS/acceleration loggers found that non-breeding birds only <b>roosted</b> in caves or other rock shelters one night in three, the other nights <b>roosting</b> in trees. The {{scientists}} responsible for the discovery also found that birds <b>roosting</b> in caves were highly active through the night, whereas birds <b>roosting</b> in the forest were far less active. They hypothesised that each environment carried costs; birds <b>roosting</b> in the forest were more vulnerable to predators and birds <b>roosting</b> in caves expended considerable energy competing with rivals and defending nesting and <b>roosting</b> ledges.|$|R
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats <b>roost</b> with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats <b>roost</b> with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a <b>roost.</b> Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E

5|$|Turquoise parrots are {{encountered}} in pairs or small groups consisting {{of parents and}} several offspring, though they may congregate into larger flocks of up to 75 predominantly juvenile birds outside the breeding season. As the breeding season nears, pairs separate out from these flocks. Turquoise parrots <b>roost</b> together communally in autumn and winter. At night they <b>roost</b> among the foliage of trees such as gums or wattles, anywhere from 1 to 8m (3–25ft) above the ground. They retreat to trees near their feeding areas during the day. The calls of the turquoise parrot have been little-studied; birds give a high-pitched soft contact call when feeding or in flight, while the alarm call {{has been described as}} a high-pitched zitting call. Turquoise parrots also chatter when settling to <b>roost</b> in the evening.|$|E
40|$|Group (GIRC), aims {{to develop}} a {{constantly}} updated national database of bat <b>roosts.</b> Short-term objectives are to inventory <b>roosts</b> and identify the most important ones from a conser-vation perspective, in order to set priorities for management actions. Published records and field data from 1990 onwards are filed. To date, the database contains 1243 records from 750 <b>roosts,</b> covering 352 10 x 10 km UTM grid-cells.

5|$|Group-living species {{tend to be}} {{communal}} group breeders. In {{addition to}} these species, a number of species may join mixed-species foraging flocks with other insectivorous birds, although they tend {{to stay at the}} edges of these groups. Joining these flocks allows woodpeckers to decrease their anti-predator vigilance and increase their feeding rate. Woodpeckers are diurnal, roosting at night inside holes and crevices. In many species the <b>roost</b> will become the nest-site during the breeding season, but in some species they have separate functions; the grey-and-buff woodpecker makes several shallow holes for roosting which are quite distinct from its nesting site. Most birds <b>roost</b> alone and will oust intruders from their chosen site, but the Magellanic woodpecker and acorn woodpecker are cooperative roosters.|$|E
5|$|Information on the {{reproduction}} of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat is limited.

40|$|<b>Roosting</b> {{behavior}} {{is common to}} most avian pests of agriculture. Movements from highly aggregated distributions in <b>roosts</b> to highly dispersed distributions on foraging grounds determine pattern and severity of avian pest problems. This research seeks {{an understanding of how}} <b>roosting</b> behavior influences the dispersion of avian agricultural pests and the damage they cause. My focus is on why birds form communal <b>roosts</b> and how communal <b>roosting</b> influences the selection of foraging sites. I document patterns of <b>roosting</b> behavior in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) through population level studies, followed by analysis of individual behavior using radio telemetry. Starlings maintain long-term fidelity (up to 130 days) to the same diurnal activity center (DAC), while using a variety of <b>roosting</b> sites at night. DACs tend to {{be at the center of}} the distribution of <b>roosting</b> sites used by individual birds. These and other results contradict expectations based on the most widely held explanations for <b>roosting</b> behavior and have led us to a new interpretation based on an association between large <b>roosts</b> and high-quality feeding sites (e. g., agricultural fields). Examination of previous attempts to manage avian pest problems in light of these new findings helps explain some earlier successes and failures, and may also promote development of new more efficient approaches to avian pest problems...|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} been {{reported}} to have used a wide variety of structures such as caves, mines, and buildings as day <b>roosts</b> during the summer months 78.

While the majority of recorded day <b>roosts</b> have been in rock crevices, those members living in the pacific northwest can often be found <b>roosting</b> in tree snags 8.|$|R
50|$|The TSH makes several {{assumptions}} {{that must be}} met {{in order for the}} theory to work. The first major assumption is that within communal <b>roosts</b> there are certain <b>roosts</b> that possess safer or more beneficial qualities than other <b>roosts.</b> The second assumption is that the more dominant individuals will be capable of securing these <b>roosts,</b> and finally dominance rank must be a reliable indicator of foraging ability.|$|R

5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} cull {{vampire bat}} populations in areas where human-wildlife {{conflict}} is a concern. Vampire bats are captured with mist nets and coated {{with a combination of}} petroleum jelly and warfarin. The bat returns to its <b>roost</b> {{and other members of the}} <b>roost</b> become poisoned as well by ingesting the warfarin after reciprocal grooming. Suspected vampire bat roosts may also be coated in the warfarin solution, though this kills other bat species and remains in the environment for years. The efficacy of killing vampire bats to reduce rabies transmission is questionable, however; a study in Peru showed that culling programs did not lead to lower transmission rates of rabies to livestock and humans.|$|E
5|$|Also defined herewith: seabird colony; {{breeding}} colony; communal roost; heronries; rookery. A large {{congregation of}} individuals {{of one or}} more species of bird that nest or <b>roost</b> in proximity at a particular location. Many kinds of birds are known to congregate in groups of varying size; a congregation of nesting birds is called a breeding colony. A group of birds congregating for rest is called a communal <b>roost.</b> Approximately 13% of all bird species nest colonially. Nesting colonies are very common among seabirds on cliffs and islands. Nearly 95% of seabirds are colonial, leading to the usage, seabird colony, sometimes called a rookery. Many species of terns nest in colonies on the ground. Herons, egrets, storks and other large waterfowl also nest communally in what are called heronries. Colony nesting may be an evolutionary response to a shortage of safe nesting sites and abundance or unpredictable food sources which are far away from the nest sites.|$|E

5|$|M. alcathoe {{lives in}} small groups. In Greece, a {{maternity}} colony, containing three females and two juveniles, {{has been found}} in a plane tree. Additional <b>roosts</b> were found high in oak trees in Baden-Württemberg and Saxony-Anhalt. Twenty-seven <b>roosting</b> sites have been found in the Czech Republic, all but one in trees (the last was in a concrete pole). Most of the tree <b>roosts</b> were in oaks (Quercus robur); others were in limes (Tilia cordata), birches (Betula pendula), and various other species. Its strong preference for <b>roosting</b> sites in trees is unusual among European bats. <b>Roosts</b> tend to be located high in the canopy, and are often in old trees.

40|$|This study {{provides}} preliminary findings related to {{whether and how}} the <b>roosting</b> of starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in reedbeds influences the survival of clutches of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). During the nesting seasons of 2014 and 2015, we surveyed the complete area of a mining pond in Serbia (south-eastern Europe) for great reed warbler nests, {{and the presence of}} <b>roosting</b> starlings was also recorded. Using the Mayfield method, we estimated the daily survival rate of great reed warbler eggs and nestlings, and compared these rates between starling <b>roosting</b> and non-roosting areas. Although both egg and nestling survival rates were lower in the Starling <b>roosting</b> than in the non-roosting areas, the differences were not significant, which was also reflected in overall nesting success. However, when only data from the time period when starling <b>roosting</b> occurred, the overall great reed warbler egg survival was significantly lower in <b>roosting</b> areas than in non- <b>roosting</b> areas. Our results suggest that Starling <b>roosting</b> did not influence the clutch survival of the great reed warbler significantly, but that there can be a negative short-term or local effect. Our study implies that a larger number of starlings and a longer <b>roosting</b> period could affect clutch survival more negatively...|$|R
5|$|Another habit {{the moth}} has {{in common with}} many {{butterflies}} is the night resting posture—the wings are held vertically over the back. During their migrations they <b>roost</b> in a group for the night. The moth flies over the crown of trees and in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100m (300ft), it then falls, inert and wings closed, to the ground.|$|E

Four places of <b>roosting</b> were identified in Suseni, Rociu, Negraşi and Slobozia. 0. 94 individuals per km of road, 14. 11 individuals per <b>roosting</b> place and 0. 067 <b>roosting</b> places per km of road were estimated. In the Romanian Plain of the Argeş County, there are in average 47. 98 individuals/ 100 km 2 (3. 4 <b>roosting</b> places/ 100 km 2) and approximately 655 individuals (gathered in ca. 46 <b>roosting</b> places) and in the entire Argeş County, there are ca. 800 - 1100 individuals and 60 - 80 <b>roosting</b> places. The mean of the owls’ number per tree in the <b>roosting</b> place was 6. 57. It has been found that between November and March, the number of individuals generally grows as the air temperature raises and generally decreases as the depth of the snow bed increases.

50|$|Communal <b>roosting</b> is {{an animal}} {{behavior}} {{where a group}} of individuals, typically of the same species, congregate in an area for a few hours based on an external signal and will return to the same site with the reappearance of the signal.

The distinction between communal <b>roosting</b> and cooperative breeding is the absence of chicks in communal <b>roosts.</b> While communal <b>roosting</b> is generally observed in birds, the behavior has also been seen in bats, primates, and insects. The size of these <b>roosts</b> can measure in the thousands to millions of individuals, especially among avian species.|$|R
