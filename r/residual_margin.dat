For each candidate BS-i, we set its transmit power level (if selected) to be P(i)=Pmin(i)+Δ(i)≤Pmax″(i), whereby Δ(i), 0 <Δ(i)<=Δmax(i). It is noted that setting a higher value of Δ(i) increases the <b>residual</b> <b>margin</b> at the receiver of node’s i transmission, {{but at the}} same time lowers the residual interference margin at receivers that have already been scheduled at this time slot. To simplify the implementation of the algorithm, we proceed to select the middle value for Δ(i) for the simulation results presented in the latter section.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{combined}} approach to strength assessment of stay ropes in suspension bridges is considered. The rope working condition is analyzed by in-situ magnetic testing, computational assessment of ultimate breaking load {{and evaluation of}} <b>residual</b> <b>margin</b> of safety. The diagnostic parameters – distributed and/or local faults in wires – are used as input data for mechanical model of rope structure. The model allows calculating the stresses in each wire, simulating the degradation process and evaluating the rope breaking tensile load. The safety factor of deteriorated rope is considered as a generalized parameter that specifies the rope safe operation as an element of bridge stay arrangement. Examples of integrity analysis of stranded stay ropes and locked coil stay ropes are presented...|$|E
40|$|During {{the years}} 2010, 2011 and 2012 {{a large amount}} of LHC data was recorded, which also {{included}} failure events in the LHC Beam Dumping System (LBDS). We used these data for the validation of the safety and reliability analyses of the LBDS which were performed in 2003 - 2006. The results of the analysis confirm the agreement of the calculated statistics with the predicted estimates. The LBDS generated a number of about 10 false beam dumps per year, which is in agreement with the estimated 8 ± 2. A thorough investigation of the data set also confirms that the LBDS always preserved a sufficient <b>residual</b> <b>margin</b> of safety for all identified failure scenarios, and globally meets SIL 3 at least. These results are accompanied by several recommendations, among which instructions for updating the reliability model to the actual operation scenarios, and suggestions for the improvement of safety and availability of the LBDS...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{performed}} a retrospective study evaluating {{the effect on}} survival of different sites of microscopic residual disease at the bronchial resection margin after surgical intervention for {{non-small cell lung cancer}}. METHODS: Survival of patients with different sites of residual disease was compared with survival of patients with curative resections, taking the pathologic TNM stage of the tumor into consideration. RESULTS: There was a trend for patients with stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer with residual disease limited to the epithelium and with peribronchial invasion to behave like patients with complete resections (61 % and 41 % five-year survival for stage I and II disease, respectively). This contrasts with patients with submucosal invasion and lymphatic infiltration, among whom there were no survivors at 5 years. There was no difference in survival between curative resections and residual disease of any type when the tumor was stage III or IV. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stage I and II disease, when residual disease consists of submucosal invasion or lymphatic infiltration, specific and aggressive treatments to clear <b>residual</b> <b>margins</b> might be contemplated because of their possible adverse effect on survival. This contrasts with patients with stage III and IV disease, in whom survival is more related to the stage of the primary tumor than to residual disease...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The rapid distal falloff of a proton beam {{allows for}} sparing of normal tissues distal to the target. However proton beams that aim {{directly}} towards critical structures are avoided due to concerns of range uncertainties, such as CT number conversion and anatomy variations. We propose to eliminate range uncertainty and enable prostate treatment {{with a single}} anterior beam by detecting the proton’s range at the prostate-rectal interface and adaptively adjusting the range in vivo and in real-time. Materials and Methods: A prototype device, consisting of an endorectal liquid scintillation detector and dual-inverted Lucite wedges for range compensation, was designed to test the feasibility and accuracy of the technique. Liquid scintillation filled volume was fitted with optical fiber and placed inside the rectum of an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom. Photodiode-generated current signal was generated {{as a function of}} proton beam distal depth, and the spatial resolution of this technique was calculated by relating the variance in detecting proton spills to its maximum penetration depth. The relative water-equivalent thickness of the wedges was measured in a water phantom and prospectively tested to determine the accuracy of range corrections. Treatment simulation studies were performed to test the potential dosimetric benefit in sparing the rectum. Results: The spatial resolution of the detector in phantom measurement was 0. 5 mm. The precision of the range correction was 0. 04 mm. The <b>residual</b> <b>margin</b> to ensure CTV coverage was 1. 1 mm. The composite distal margin for 95 % treatment confidence was 2. 4 mm. Planning studies based on a previously estimated 2 mm margin (90 % treatment confidence) for 27 patients showed a rectal sparing up to 51 % at 70 Gy and 57 % at 40 Gy relative to IMRT and bilateral proton treatment. Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility of our design. Use of this technique allows for proton treatment using a single anterior beam, significantly reducing the rectal dose...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Maintenance, {{repair and}} {{overhaul}} processes (MRO processes) are elaborate and complex. Rising demands on these after sales services require reliable production planning and control methods particularly for maintaining valuable capital goods. Downtimes lead to high costs and {{an inability to}} meet delivery due dates results in severe contract penalties. Predicting the required capacities for maintenance orders in advance is often difficult due to unknown part conditions unless the goods are actually inspected. This planning uncertainty results in extensive capital tie-up by rising stock levels within the whole MRO network. This paper outlines an approach to planning capacities when maintenance data forecasting is volatile. It focuses {{on the development of}} prerequisites for a reliable capacity planning method. This is achieved by deriving order probabilities from Bayesian networks. In addition the <b>residual</b> wear <b>margin</b> is used to determine an appropriate part-dependent work content...|$|R

40|$|Background: Non–melanoma {{skin cancer}} (NMSC) {{is the most}} common {{malignancy}} in the United States. Recommended treatment for NMSC remains surgical excision following a positive biopsy. Evidence of complete spontaneous regression of residual NMSC exists in the case of small lesions macroscopically removed by shave biopsy, but with a positive microscopic margin. The present study investigates the rate at which residual tumor is present at subsequent excisional biopsy, with the aim to assess if recommendation to forgo surgical excision can be made. Methods: A total of 233 shave biopsies of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were performed during a 5 -year period. All specimens included in the study were less than 2 cm in diameter, were macroscopically removed by shave biopsy, and had a positive initial microscopic margin. Results: On subsequent surgical excisional biopsy, 42 % of BCC specimens were negative for residual tumor, 38 % had residual tumor, but the tumor was completely contained in the excised specimen, and 20 % of the specimens had positive <b>margin</b> <b>residual</b> tumor. For SCC specimens, 73 % were negative for residual tumor, 21 % had residual tumor, but the tumor was completely contained in the excised specimen, and 6 % of the specimens had positive <b>margin</b> <b>residual</b> tumor. Conclusions: Although reduction of residual tumor at reexcision is noted with both BCC and even more so with SCC, the rate at which this occurs is not sufficient that a general recommendation to forgo surgical excision can be made...|$|R
40|$|Gastroesophageal {{junction}} (GEJ) adenocarcinoma is {{a lethal}} cancer with rising incidence, yet the molecular biomarkers that have strong prognostic impact and also hold great therapeutic promise remain elusive. We used a data mining approach and identified the p 21 protein-activated kinase 1 (PAK 1), an oncogene and drugable protein kinase, {{to be among}} the most promising targets for GEJ adenocarcinoma. Immunoblot analysis and data mining demonstrated that PAK 1 protein and mRNA were upregulated in cancer tissues compared to the noncancerous tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed PAK 1 overexpression in 72. 6 % of primary GEJ adenocarcinomas (n = 113). A step-wise increase in PAK 1 levels was noted from paired normal epithelium, to atypical hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. PAK 1 overexpression in tumor was associated with lymph node (LN) metastasis (P, 0. 001), advanced tumor stage (P, 0. 001), large tumor size (P = 0. 006), <b>residual</b> surgical <b>margin</b> (P = 0. 033), and unfavorable overall survival (P, 0. 001). Multivariate analysis showed PAK 1 overexpression is an independent high-risk prognostic predictor (P, 0. 001). Collectively, PAK 1 is overexpressed during tumorigenic progression and its upregulation correlates with malignant properties mainly relevant to invasion and metastasis. PAK 1 expression coul...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Defective restorations such as overhang, overcontour, open <b>margin,</b> <b>residual</b> cement or subgingival margin, lead {{to severe}} plaque {{accumulation}} and prevent using oral hygiene devices and finally {{they can cause}} gingival inflammation and periodontal destruction. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the frequency of restorations that have potentiality of periodontal destruction in participants referred to Faculty of dentistry, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences in 2011. Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, patients referred to Oral Medicine department were selected to reach 150 participants. All restorations were investigated regarding the existence of overhang, overcontour, open margin, subgingival <b>margin,</b> and <b>residual</b> cement. Results: Totally, 348 restorations were investigated that within 208 amalgam fillings, 88 fillings (42. 30 %) were with overhang. Among 79 composite fillings, 17 fillngs (21. 51 %) had overhang and overcountour. From 65 metal ceramic crowns, 21 crowns (32. 30 %) had open margin and 15 crowns (23. 70 %) had subgingival <b>margins.</b> Moreover, <b>residual</b> cement was not found.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to measure the gain observed in the liver-to-tumor contrast of perioperative images when using mangafodipir trisodium, a liver-specific contrast agent, during percutaneous cryosurgery of the liver performed {{under the guidance of}} magnetic resonance images. Retrospective quantitative analyses of MR images were performed on eleven patients having a total of 30 liver tumors treated by MR-guided percutaneous cryosurgery. An initial group of four patients were treated with no contrast agent, and was compared with a second group of 7 patients who received an intravenous injection of 5 mumol/kg of mangafodipir for their cryosurgery. The percutaneous cryosurgery was monitored under the near-real-time-imaging mode of a 0. 5 T open-configuration MRI system using a T- 1 -weighted Gradient-recalled echo pulse sequence. A significant improvement in the liver-to-tumor contrast-to-noise ratio was observed with mangafodipir (p < 0. 05, paired t test) in 0. 5 T preoperative images. Along with the stability of the mangafodipir contrast enhancement during the entire cryosurgical procedure, the resulting gain in contrast allowed for better visualizing the presence of <b>residual</b> untreated tumor <b>margins</b> at the periphery of the cryosurgery iceball directly from perioperative images acquired with patients under narcosis. Consequently, it not only became easier for the interventionalist to determine the need for an additional cryoprobe to increase the size of the iceball during the procedure, but also to decide on the appropriate end point of the cryosurgery...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This report {{describes}} transesophageal echocardiographic {{guidance of}} transcatheter closure of ventricular septal defects and its value {{as an adjunct}} to fluoroscopy and angiography in this procedure. Background. Experience with transcatheter closure of ventricular septal defects has identified a diverse group of patients in whom it may be the procedure of choice. Although facilitating other interventional procedures, such as transcatheter closure of atrial septal defects, the value of transesophageal echocardiographic guidance for transcatheter ventricular septal defect closure has not been documented. Methods. All patients who underwent ventricular septal defect closure with transesophageal echocardiographic guidance before November 1992 were included. Angiograms and echocardiograms were reviewed to evaluate device position and relation to valve tissue during placement and to assess residual flow after device implantation. The ability of transesophageal echocardiography to assess these variables was compared with fluoroscopy and angiography. Results. Transesophageal echocardiographic guidance was used in 31 of the 83 catheterizations involving transcatheter ventricular septal defect closure performed between February 1990 and November 1992. Under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance, 45 devices were implanted: 23 in muscular ventricular septal defects, 17 in <b>residual</b> postoperative patch <b>margin</b> defects and 5 in other ventricular septal defects. Transesophageal echocardiographic guidance enhanced assessment of device position and proximity to valve structures and markedly improved assessment of residual flow. Assessment of residual flow with transesophageal echocardiography elimuinated the need for multiple angiograms in some patients. Combining transesophageal echocardiography with fluoroscopy and angiography provided the most information. Conclusions. Transesophageal echocardiography facilitates transcatheter closure of ventricular septal defects by improving assessment of device position and effectiveness of closure. It is indicated when device placement is likely to be difficult or may interfere with valve structures or when multiple interventional procedures are anticipated...|$|R

Forty-nine cases of previously untreated primary SS (23 females and 26 males, ranging in age from 7 to 81, with 31 tumors located in the lower extremity, 8 at the upper extremity and 10 at the trunchus), without regional lymph-node or distant metastases were studied. We investigated the relationship between (flow and image) DNA cytometry, proliferation activity, clinicopathologic parameters, and relapse-free and overall survival of the patients. The prognostic value of gender, age, duration of symptoms, location, compartmentalization, size, adequacy of surgical <b>margins,</b> <b>residual</b> tumor, adjuvant therapy, histologic subtype, extent of necrosis, glandular differentiation, calcification, and extent of hemangiopericytic areas, mitotic rate, amount of mast cells, blood vessel invasion, histologic (UICC and NCI) grades, DNA ploidy, percentage of cells in S and S+G 2 phases, PCNA and Ki- 67 labeling indices (LI), and TNM (UICC) stage of the tumors, were evaluated by univariate and multivariate (Cox hazard model) analyses. Short duration of symptoms (< 12 months), biphasic SS, scarcity of mast cells (< 10 / 10 HPF), high mitotic rate (≥ 10 / 10 HPF), high histologic grade (grade 3), high PCNA-LI (≥ 20 %), high Ki- 67 -LI (≥ 10 %), DNA aneuploidy, and advanced TNM stage (stage III) were features associated with significantly shorter relapse-free and overall 5 -year survival rates in the univariate analyses. Scarcity of mast cells, high mitotic rate, or high PCNA-LI were significant predictors of poor survival, in addition to TNM stage in the multivariate analyses. The amount of mast cells was inversely correlated with mitotic rate and PCNA-LI. Scarcity of mast cells, high mitotic rate, or high PCNA-LI are factors associated with poor prognosis, in addition to advanced TNM stage in patients with localized S...|$|R
