[...] In the team's 36 games, Scheyer led the Blue Devils in minutes, free throws, free throw percentage, 3-point field goals, 3-point field goal percentage (.395), assists, and assists per game (2.8). [...] He was named the MVP of the 2009 ACC Tournament after scoring 29 points in the championship game. Krzyzewski said after the season: [...] "He's a great competitor. [...] He handles the ball <b>real</b> <b>well.</b> He scores—he scored more when he was bringing the ball up than when he didn't bring the ball up. I think the more the ball is in Jon's hands, the better." [...] Reflecting his off-the-court accomplishments, Scheyer was a 2009 ACC Academic Honor Roll selection.|$|E
500|$|The full album {{versions}} continued, {{as well as}} a localized {{rendition of}} [...] "Wrecking Ball", at Springsteen's four shows to close out the Philadelphia Spectrum as well; some 43 different songs were playing during the stand. [...] Apart from the album playings, Springsteen kept setlists flexible during the third leg; sign requests continued, as in Springsteen's words they allowed [...] "the fans to have input into the show in a way that just pumps the blood into everything and enlivens the evening." [...] Born to Run remained the standard full album choice {{for the rest of the}} tour, but the two shows at New York's Madison Square Garden saw The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle and The River, with the latter's 20-song length dominating the setlist. [...] Springsteen felt The River show succeeded, saying [...] "I sequenced [...] to feel like a live show, so you have four fast songs and a couple of ballads. It played <b>real</b> <b>well</b> when we went to play it." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 9, 2009, Ciara {{performed}} the song on Saturday Night Live with Timberlake, that night's host. Accompanied by live instruments, Ciara performed choreography with backup dancers, while Timberlake played the keyboard. Timberlake and Ciara danced provocatively {{after he came}} from behind the keyboard to perform his verse. During the set, Ciara also performed [...] "Never Ever." [...] A writer for BET's Sound Off Blog said: [...] "Aside {{from the fact that}} her grunts were live and her stage humps were unreal, Ciara’s set was pretty decent. Not that I expected any less from the A-Town princess, but that was a pretty tasty performance." [...] The writer pointed out that Timberlake was not even noted on the set until he began his verse. In an interview with MTV News, Ciara went into detail about the setup of the performance, stating: [...] "I just kind of felt cool, 'cause Justin can play [...] <b>real</b> <b>well</b> and he really gets into the music and it was, like, 'Hey, let's make you part of the band.' Having Justin in the background for the live performance was very different from the music video for the song, where we two dance quite provocatively with one another. [...] do something different and make it fun. It was awesome to see him pick up the keys." ...|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on the {{geophysical}} "tracer dilution technique" in the well. The main aim of my thesis was to test modern autonomous conductivity meter (Levelogger, Solinst co. Canada) for this method in the artificially assembler <b>well,</b> where the <b>real</b> flow rate can be measured and controlled unlike in case of <b>real</b> <b>wells.</b> To compare the flow rate directly measured on inflow tubes to well and indirectly derived from tracer dilution technique the mean residence time in vertical segments was used. Based on 8 experiments the autonomous conductivity meter and also conductivity meters with probe on cable can be used for tracer dilution technique. Experiments clearly demonstrated that salt solution is slowly leached even from dead zones in unscreened part of the well at lest several tens of cms from boundary with creened casing. Salt solution is migrating from dead zones to sreened parts of the well. As a result the tracer dilution technique gives up to 2 times slower horizontál flow rate than directly measured flow. Similar effect may exit on <b>real</b> <b>wells.</b> Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

Cranston has said that Edwards' approach to the film and to its characterization is what drew him to the project. He stated, [...] "The {{most important thing about}} this version of Godzilla is the characterization. The characters in this are <b>real,</b> <b>well</b> drawn. [...] takes the time to really establish who these people are, that you root for them, that you invest in these characters, and that you care for them. That's the best part of it." [...] Cranston additionally added, [...] "I wouldn't be here if it was just, 'Look out, this monster is crushing everything!' Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize the people. You root for them and sympathize with their plight". Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, [...] "Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic." [...] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before filming Godzilla. Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be [...] "silly", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston enough to read the script and join the film. Cranston, despite his positive opinion on the film, would later opine that killing off Joe Brody so early was a [...] "narrative mistake".|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{is widely}} hailed {{as one of}} the most {{influential}} pianists in the history of rock and roll. [...] In an often quoted tribute, Elvis Presley once said that if he could play the piano like Lewis he would quit singing. [...] Lewis's pivotal role in popularizing the piano in rock and roll is indisputable. [...] Up until his arrival, the music had been primarily associated with guitars, but his early Sun recordings and television appearances pushed the instrument to the forefront. [...] Lewis was also an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. [...] Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players. [...] In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until [...] "Great Balls of Fire," [...] "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. [...] My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that." [...] Lewis is primarily known for his [...] "boogie woogie" [...] style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. [...] Appearing on Memphis Sounds with George Klein in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, [...] "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself <b>real</b> <b>well.</b> [...] I miss Carl very much." [...] Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. [...] Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs, confiding, [...] "Paul Whitehead done a lot. [...] His lesson was worth a billion dollars to me...He taught me. [...] I'd sit beside him, and say, 'Mr. Paul, can you show me exactly how you do that?' [...] Mr. Paul was good to me." ...|$|E
