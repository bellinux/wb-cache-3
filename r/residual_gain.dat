The study focused on 89 elementary teachers in 11 schools across 5 districts, all of whom participated in a state-sponsored staff development project during the 1999 / 2000 academic year. This staff development initiative was designed to assist teachers in acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary to develop and implement standards-based math instruction and assessment in their classrooms. Using surveys, interviews, and written teacher logs, data were gathered regarding the amounts and types of staff development in which teachers engaged, teachers_ concerns about standards-based instruction and assessment, school and teacher characteristics thought to influence the adoption and use of standards-based instruction and assessment, and the frequency with which teachers employed various instructional and assessment strategies in their classrooms. Stepwise regression analyses were subsequently performed to explore the utility of using school features, teacher characteristics, and types of staff development in which teachers engaged to predict <b>residual</b> <b>gains</b> in concern about and reported use of standards-based instruction and assessment. Study findings revealed that <b>residual</b> <b>gains</b> in level of concern about standards-based instruction and assessment in mathematics were significantly predicted by teacher involvement in the following staff development activities: examining/analyzing student work and implementing standards-based classroom activities while carrying out action research. Furthermore, increases in teacher self-efficacy were found to be associated with <b>residual</b> <b>gains</b> in intensity of concern, while involvement in curriculum development was associated with negative gains in level of concern. Finally, analyses revealed that a combination of personal (years teaching), organizational (principal supportiveness and organizational climate), and staff development (curriculum development) factors were influential in predicting <b>residual</b> <b>gains</b> in use of standards_based instruction and assessment. The implications of this study on the design of future change initiatives were presented, as were recommendations for future research.

40|$|Background: Although anxiety {{disorders}} are prevalent in older adults, randomized controlled trials of treatment effectiveness for late-life anxiety are scarce and have {{focused primarily on}} the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions. However, recent findings suggest that in some cases, pharmacological treatment may be more beneficial for late-life {{anxiety disorders}}. As yet, there have been no systematic studies investigating prognostic factors for the outcome of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy for late-life anxiety. The objective {{of the present study was}} to study long-term treatment outcomes and to explore differential predictors for both short-term and long-term treatment outcomes of sertraline and CBT for late-life anxiety disorders. Methods: Participants of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing sertraline and CBT for the treatment of late-life anxiety were contacted one year after completing their treatment, so that predictors for both short-term and long-term treatment outcome could be established. Results: Sertraline showed a greater reduction of symptoms than CBT on anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; HARS) and worry (Worry Domain Questionnaire) ratings at one-year follow-up. The strongest predictor for short-term CBT outcome was poor perceived health, explaining 40 % of the variance in post-treatment <b>residual</b> <b>gain</b> scores on the HARS. The strongest predictor for long-term CBT outcome was neuroticism, explaining 20 % of the variance in <b>residual</b> <b>gain</b> scores at one-year follow-up. Analyses revealed no significant predictors for treatment outcome in sertraline participants. Conclusions: Our study suggests that long-term use of sertraline might be more beneficial for late-life anxiety than a 15 -week CBT program. Poor perceived health and neuroticism are predictive of less improvement after CBT in anxious older adults.

The data set used consisted of 51, 893 live weight records and 903, 436 feed intake, residual feed intake (defined as the difference between an animal’s actual feed intake and its expected feed intake), and <b>residual</b> daily <b>gain</b> (defined as the difference between an animal’s actual growth rate and its expected growth rate) records from 10, 201 growing pigs. Genetic co-variance parameters for all traits were estimated using random regression Legendre polynomials. Daily heritability estimates for live weight ranged from 0. 25 ± 0. 04 (d 73) to 0. 50 ± 0. 03 (d 122). Low to moderate heritability estimates were evident for feed intake, ranging from 0. 07 ± 0. 03 (d 66) to 0. 25 ± 0. 02 (d 170). The estimated heritability for residual feed intake was generally lower than those of both live weight and feed intake and ranged from 0. 04 ± 0. 01 (d 96) to 0. 17 ± 0. 02 (d 159). The heritability for feed intake and residual feed intake increased in the early stages of the test period and subsequently sharply declined, coinciding with older ages. Heritability estimates for <b>residual</b> daily <b>gain</b> ranged from 0. 26 ± 0. 03 (d 188) to 0. 42 ± 0. 03 (d 101).

Moderate to strong genetic correlations were evident among live weight, feed intake, and the efficiency traits, particularly in the early stage of the trial period (d 66 to 86), but weakened with age. Results from this study could be implemented into the national genetic evaluation for pigs, providing comprehensive information on the profile of growth and efficiency throughout the growing period of the animal’s life, thus helping producers identify genetically superior animals...|$|R

Performance, feed intake and feeding behavior traits were measured in bulls (n = 5, 165) representing 2 breeds (4100 Angus and 952 Red Angus). Intake and feeding behavior traits were measured for 70 -d using a GrowSafe system while fed a corn silage based diet (ME = 2. 50 Mcal/kg DM). BW was measured at 14 -d intervals. Residual feed intake (RFI) was calculated as the difference between actual DMI and that expected from regression of DMI on mid-test BW 0. 75 (MBW) and ADG, and <b>residual</b> <b>gain</b> (RG) as the difference between actual ADG and that expected from regression of ADG on MBW and DMI. <b>Residual</b> <b>gain</b> and intake (RIG) was computed as the sum of - 1 x RFI and RG, both standardized to a variance of 1. Results from the study indicate that RFI was correlated with DMI (r = 0. 71, P < 0. 0001) but not MBW or ADG, whereas, RG was correlated with ADG (r = 0. 87, P < 0. 0001) but not MBW or DMI. RFI was negatively correlated with G:F (r = - 0. 53, P < 0. 0001) and RG (r = - 0. 40, P < 0. 0001). Feeding bout (FB) frequency and duration were correlated with RFI (r = 0. 30, 0. 36; P < 0. 001), but were not significant or weakly correlated (r < 0. 10) with RG and G:F.

In the current study functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from participants with social anxiety disorder (SAD) was used to elucidate whether neural responses to negative evaluation could predict treatment response in SAD. Nine weeks prior to Internet- delivered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (ICBT) onset, participants viewed negative social stimuli directed either at themselves or an significant other during fMRI scanning. Regression analyses including the differential activations for other-referential criticism in contrast to self-referential criticism in the posterior mid cingulate cortex (pMCC) and the lingual gyrus (LG) predicted 34 % of treatment change as measured by <b>residual</b> <b>gain</b> scores on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Self-Report (LSAS-SR) in our sample. The final regression model, combining these measures with behavioural measures, which by themselves explained 27 % of the variance, resulted in a model explaining 50 % of the variance regarding treatment response. This lends additional support to the notion that further elucidating the neurobiological underpinnings of core processes in SAD, as well as the neural correlates of treatment response to CBT, would be of great value in predicting treatment outcome. ...|$|E

The division of those seats between those parties is, however, done in a different way, by using the largest remainder method, which favours the smaller parties rather than the bigger ones {{if there is a}} considerable difference in size.
