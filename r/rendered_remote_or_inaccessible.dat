40|$|ABSTRACT. This study {{presents}} {{a method that}} allows continuous monitoring of mass balance for <b>remote</b> <b>or</b> <b>inaccessible</b> glaciers, based on repeated oblique photography. Hourly to daily pictures from two automatic cameras overlooking two large valley glaciers in the Swiss Alps are available for eight ablation seasons (2004 – 11) in total. We determine the fraction of snow-covered glacier surface from orthorectified and georeferenced images and combine this information with simple accumulation and melt modelling using meteorological data. By applying this approach, the evolution of glacier-wide mass balance throughout the ablation period can be directly calculated, based on terrestrial remote-sensing data. Validation against independent in situ mass-balance observations indicates good agreement. Our methodology has considerable potential for the remote determination of mountain glacier mass balance at high temporal resolution and could be applied using both repeated terrestrial and air-/spaceborne observations...|$|R

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks {{constitute}} {{pervasive and}} distributed computing systems and are potentially {{one of the}} most important technologies of this century. They have been specifically identified as a good candidate to become an integral part of the protection of critical infrastructures. In this paper we focus on railway infrastructure protection and we present the details of a sensor platform designed to be integrated into a slab track system in order to carry out both installation and maintenance monitoring activities. In the installation phase, the platform helps operators to install the slab tracks in the right position. In the maintenance phase, the platform collects information about the structural health and behavior of the infrastructure when a train travels along it and relays the readings to a base station. The base station uses trains as data mules to upload the information to the internet. The use of a train as a data mule is especially suitable for collecting information from <b>remote</b> <b>or</b> <b>inaccessible</b> places which do not have a direct connection to the internet and require less network infrastructure.

40|$|In {{telepresence}} and telemanipulation systems, multimodal data is exchanged over {{a network}} allowing humans to experience and {{to operate in}} <b>remote</b> <b>or</b> <b>inaccessible</b> environments. To operate over the global Internet and connect to multiple telepresence systems, a flexible framework for initiating, handling and terminating Internet-based telerobotic sessions becomes necessary. In this work, we explore the use of standard Internet session and transport protocols {{in the context of}} telerobotic applications. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely used to handle multimedia teleconference sessions with audio, video or text, and provides many services advantageous for establishing connections between heterogeneous haptic interfaces and telerobotic systems. We apply the session paradigm to the creation and negotiation of haptic telepresence sessions and propose to extend this framework to work with the haptic modality. The notion of a “haptic codec ” is introduced for transforming haptic data into a common format, applying data reduction or compression techniques and implementing teleoperation control architectures. The use of the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) is explored for transport of teleoperation data. Finally, a prototype and demonstrator system is presented for evaluation of the proposed framework.

40|$|Molecular {{methods are}} {{increasingly}} {{used to identify}} prey DNA in predators' faeces to describe diet composition. However, such analysis can reveal much more ecological information. If faeces are regarded as 'biodiversity capsules', they can help describe and quantify ecological communities by containing {{a representative sample of}} the prey species occurring in the foraging area of a given predator. Here we propose to analyse these 'capsules' and infer the occurrence, distribution and minimum abundance estimate of prey communities. This novel approach goes beyond the detection of 'targeted' prey groups to inform dietary studies of predators. It is particularly suited to the study of prey communities that are difficult to sample with traditional methods because they are very small, rare and/or live in <b>remote</b> <b>or</b> <b>inaccessible</b> habitats. Such communities include invertebrates inhabiting the soil, deep-sea species, and small, rare flying insects. The proposed approach has the potential to inform the topical issue of biodiversity assessment and provide a new framework for the discovery of species with minimum interference to ecosystems and without the need for extensive trapping, which can be labour intensive and could kill many individuals of non-target species. Rigorous testing of this approach, and in particular direct comparison with traditional sampling methods is required to fully demonstrate its efficacy...|$|R
