40|$|Two-dimensional 2 -bands {{insulators}} {{breaking time}} reversal symmetry can present topological phases indexed by a topological invariant called the Chern number. Here we first propose an efficient procedure to determine this topological index. This tool allows {{in principle to}} conceive 2 -bands Hamiltonians with arbitrary Chern numbers. We apply our methodology to gradually construct a quantum anomalous Hall insulator (Chern insulator) which can be tuned through five topological phases indexed by the Chern numbers { 0,+/- 1,+/- 2 }. On a cylindrical finite geometry, such insulator can therefore sustain up to two edge states which we characterize analytically. From this non-trivial Chern insulator and its time <b>reversed</b> <b>copy,</b> we build a quantum spin Hall insulator and show how the phases with a +/- 2 Chern index yield trivial Z 2 insulating phases.

40|$|The {{pathophysiology}} {{of regional}} glucose hypometabolism {{often associated with}} refractory, lesion-related, epilepsy is not well understood. In particular, the role of interictal spiking is controversial since animal models of partial epilepsy have shown that interictal spiking increases glucose metabolism. We addressed this question by studying with positron emission tomography (PET) and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) the regional cerebral metabolism in children with focal spiking unrelated to a brain lesion. Patients (11 children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECS) and two children without seizures) had on EEG centrotemporal spikes which were either strictly unilateral (ten cases) or strongly predominant on one side (three cases). We looked for an asymmetry {{in the distribution of}} cerebral glucose metabolism in our group of patients using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). After spatial normalization, a <b>reversed</b> <b>copy</b> of the 13 scans was obtained, resulting in 26 scans which were assigned to two groups: a group with left-sided centrotemporal spikes and a group with right-sided centrotemporal spikes. Regional glucose metabolism was not statistically different in the two groups. This suggests that metabolic changes associated with interictal spiking cannot be demonstrated by PET with FDG in BCECS, and that this technique could be helpful for the differentiation between idiopathic and symptomatic cases of partial epilepsy in children.

40|$|A derisive view of Andrew Jackson's reluctant, politically-minded {{endorsement}} of the Distribution Act, or "Surplus Bill," a measure authorizing distribution of surplus federal funds among the states. Facing {{the prospect of an}} almost certain Congressional override should he veto the bill, Jackson signed it on June 23, 1836, abetting Vice-President Van Buren's bid for the presidency that year. The cartoon shows Jackson (right), Van Buren (left) and Van Buren running-mate Richard M. Johnson, seated at a table pondering the bill. Jackson (with a quill in his teeth, and a spittoon or brazier by his feet) : What the devil shall I do Matty, with this Bill? if I veto it the cursed Whigs are strong enough to pass it!!

40|$|Purpose: Interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) is {{expressed}} exclusively and {{to high levels}} in photoreceptive cells. This study {{was an attempt to}} delineate the minimal regulated control region of the murine IRBP promoter involved in this expression pattern. Methods: Fragments of the mouse IRBP 5 ' flanking region were tested for promoter activity in transient transfections of embryonic chick retina cells in primary culture. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to identify specific cis-acting DNA elements within these fragments. Results: Nested deletion analysis of a 1783 bp fragment of the murine IRBP 5 ' flanking region shows that high promoter activity is maintained with truncated fragments as short as 70 bp 5 ' to transcription start, but is lost with truncation to 45 bases. The 1783 bp promoter is active in cultures of retina cells but not brain cells or fibroblasts. The 70 bp fragment is active in retina and brain cells but not fibroblasts. Within retina cell cultures, the 1783 bp fragment is active in photoreceptor-like and amorphous or unidentifiable cells whereas the 70 bp is additionally active in multipolar neuronlike cells. The- 70 to- 45 interval contains Ret- 1 /PCE-I (AATTAG in the IRBP gene), a proposed retina-specific consensus sequence cis element, and a same-strand <b>reversed</b> <b>copy</b> of this sequence, GATTAA, the consensus binding element of the photoreceptor-specific trans-acting factor CRX.

40|$|A pro-Jackson satire applauding the President's September 1833 {{order for}} the removal of federal {{deposits}} from the Bank of the United States. The combined opposition to this move from Bank president Nicholas Biddle, Senate Whigs led by Daniel Webster and Henry Clay, and the pro-Bank press are ridiculed. On the right, Jackson, cheered on by Major Jack Downing, holds aloft an "Order for the Removal of Public Money. " Jackson: "Major Jack Downing. I must act in this case with energy and decision, you see the downfall of the party engine and corrupt monopoly!!" Downing: "Hurrah! General! if this don't beat skunkin, I'm a nigger, only see that varmint Nick how spry he is, he runs along like a Weatherfield Hog with an onion in his mouth. " From the document emanate lightning bolts which topple the columns and pediment of the Bank, which crash down amidst fleeing public figures and Whig editors. Around them are strewn various newspapers and sheets with "Salary $ 6, 000 " and "Printing expenses "$ 80, 000 " printed on them. Henry Clay (at left, fallen) : "Help me up!

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} a longest {{previous}} factor (LPF) is inherent to Ziv–Lempel factorization of strings in text compression, {{as well as in}} statistics of repetitions and symmetries. It is expressed {{in the form of a}} table — LPF[i] is the maximum length of a factor starting at position i, that also appears earlier in the given text. We show how to compute efficiently three new tables storing different variants of previous factors (past segments) of a string. The longest previous non-overlapping factor, for a given position i, is the longest factor starting at i which has an exact copy occurring entirely before, while the longest previous non-overlapping reverse factor for a given position i is the longest factor starting at i, such that its <b>reverse</b> <b>copy</b> occurs entirely before. In both problems the previous copies of the factors are required to occur within the prefix ending at position i− 1. The longest previous (possibly overlapping) reverse factor is the longest factor starting at i, such that its <b>reverse</b> <b>copy</b> starts before i. These problems have not been explicitly considered before, but they have several applications and they are natural extensions of the longest previous factor problem, which has been extensively studied. Moreover, the newly introduced tables store additional information on the structure of the string, helpful to improve, for example, gapped palindrome detection and text compression using reverse factors...|$|R
