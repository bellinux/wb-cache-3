Unless emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHG) are stringently regulated or gasoline prices more than double, gasoline powered internal combustion engines will continue to dominate the light duty fleet.

40|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{suitable}} energy sources from both technological and environmental perspectives for the next century, especially in the context of a sustainable global energy economy. The most common industrial process to produce high-purity (99. 99 + mol%) hydrogen is to reform natural gas by a catalytic reaction with steam at a high temperature. Conventional steam-methane reforming (SMR) contributed to approximately 2. 4 billion standard cubic feet per day (SCFD) of hydrogen production in the US. By 1998, the growth of SMR-produced hydrogen in the US is expected to reach 3. 4 billion SCFD, with the increased demand attributed to hydrogen`s use in <b>reformulated</b> <b>gasolines</b> required by the Clean Air Act. The goal of this work is to develop an even more efficient process for reforming steam and methane to hydrogen product than the conventional SMR process. The application of Sorption Enhanced Reaction (SER) technology to SMR has the potential to markedly reduce the cost of hydrogen through lower capital and energy requirements. The development of a more cost-effective route to hydrogen production based on natural gas as the primary energy source will accelerate the transition to a more hydrogen-based economy in the future.

Absent a doubling of petroleum prices or stringent regulation [due, for example, to intense concerns about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions], ICE using fossil fuels will dominate the market for the next two decades. CNG cars have low emissions, including GHG, but must be redesigned to store enough CNG to achieve the current range. Battery-powered cars have limited range and are expensive, and the life-cycle of battery components leads to discharges of toxic materials.

Direct injection is being pursued in order to improve fuel efficiency and enhance control over, and flexibility of, spark-ignited engines. SIDI technology is being investigated by the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) as one route towards meeting both efficiency goals and more stringent emissions standards. Friction and wear of fuel injector and pump parts were identified as issues impeding adoption of SIDI by the OTT workshop on ''Research Needs Related to CIDI and SIDI Fuel Systems'' and the resulting report, Research Needs Related to Fuel Injection Systems in CIDI and SIDI Engines. The following conclusions were reached: (1) Argonne's NFC coatings consistently reduced friction and wear in existing and <b>reformulated</b> <b>gasolines.</b> (2) Compared to three commercial DLC coatings, NFC provided the best friction reduction and protection from wear in gasoline and alternative fuels. (3) NFC was successfully deposited on production fuel injectors. (4) Customized wear tests were performed to simulate the operating environment of fuel injectors. (5) Industry standard lubricity test results were consistent with customized wear tests in showing the friction and wear reduction of NFC and the lubricity of fuels. (6) Failure of NFC coatings by tensile crack opening or spallation did not occur, and issues with adhesion to steel substrates were eliminated.

40|$|The 1994 [...] 95 {{heating season}} {{approached}} with {{more attention to}} petroleum products than experienced in some time. This year, however, {{the focus was on}} transportation fuels with the introduction of <b>reformulated</b> <b>gasolines</b> scheduled for the first of 1995. Last year transportation fuels had been in the spotlight in the Northeast as well, for the ills experienced with a new winter mix for diesel fuel. Would RFG have the same dubious entrance as diesel`s winter mix? Would RFG implementation work and what effect would the change in stocks have on the refineries? With worries related to transportation fuels being recognized, would there be reason for concern with heating fuels? As the new year approached, the refineries seemed to have no problem with supplies and RFG stocks were eased in about the second week of December. In Maine, the southern half of the state was effected by the gasoline substitution but seven of Maine`s sixteen counties were directed to follow the recommended criteria. Since the major population concentration lies in the southern three counties, concern was real. Attention paid to emission testing had come to a head in the fall, and RFG complaints were likely.

The fall slipped by with no great shocks in the weather. December was more of the same, as the weather continued to favor the public.

The full evaporation technique used very high temperatures to force the analytes of interest into the gaseous phase. Using these high temperatures and no matrix modifying solution provided an analysis free of matrix effects. ^ Henry 2 ̆ 7 s Law coefficients were determined for several compounds found in <b>reformulated</b> <b>gasolines.</b> This new method relies only on the knowledge of the phase ratio defined by the experimental apparatus. The value obtained for MTBE using the method was in excellent agreement with other literature values, specifically 1. 7 M/atm. Other compounds studied included: ETBE, TAME, DIPE, benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene. ^ The comparison of gas-sampled and SPME-sampled static headspace methods when applied to GC-MS analyses was examined for the effectiveness of transferring of volatile components of several juices from sample vial to chromatograph. The results of this study showed the SPME fiber to be approximately 1400 time more effective, owing to the ability of the fiber to concentrate the analytes and transfer them without the need to inject large volumes of inert gas into the instrument. ^ Finally, the coupling of static headspace to high-speed GC allowed the reduction of the analysis time reported in the SPME study by a factor of approximately twenty times, from 75 to just 4 minutes. The sampling system designed used batch equilibration of many samples to enhance the speed of analysis, in conjunction with a sample collection method that used a trapping column to collect the sample which is rapidly transferred from the sample vial to the instrument by a stream of nitrogen. ...|$|R
