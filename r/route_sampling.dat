40|$|Random <b>route</b> <b>samples</b> {{are widely}} used in {{face-to-face}} surveys. Most previ-ous studies of random <b>route</b> <b>sample</b> quality compare the data collected by random <b>route</b> <b>samples</b> with data from reliable sources, such as the German Microcensus. While these studies usually find few differences in the distribu-tions of demographic variables, {{it is possible that}} other substantive variables of interest are biased if random <b>route</b> <b>samples</b> select households with unequal probabilities. This article takes a different approach to assessing the quality of random <b>route</b> <b>samples.</b> Since random <b>routes</b> are used when no complete list of respondents is available, it is assumed that all units have the same selection probability. This assumption is tested, by simulating all possible random routes within a German city and calculating the probability of selection for each household.

The hypothesis to be tested is that it is possible to achieve the same degree of representativeness using a combination of random <b>route</b> <b>sampling</b> and quota sampling (with substitution) as it can be achieved by means of household sampling (without subs-titution) based on the municipal register of inhabitants. We have found such marked differences in the age and gender distribution of the probability sampling, where the deviations exceed 6 %.

30|$|A third {{possibility}} is area (random <b>route)</b> <b>sampling.</b> Before 2000, when not every household possessed a telephone, {{in particular in}} the eastern parts of Germany, a good approximation of {{a random sample of}} the population was achieved by contacting subjects directly in their homes guided by routing instructions. This is still so, and it works for the population with migration background. Given a proportion of 22.5 % of all inhabitants, 14 that group is well represented in the resulting samples, without any special measures, and with a manageable screening effort, which is inverse to the proportion of the population. But as soon as country-specific groups are to be identified, such samples become highly inefficient. For example, for every person of Italian origin (population in Germany 780, 000), 128 contacts would be required. Concentrating fieldwork in areas with higher proportions of the target group is less efficient in Germany than in other countries because immigrants here are comparatively unsegregated (Schönwälder & Söhn, 2009). Without large budgets, immigrant samples using random walk will result in poor sample quality.|$|E
40|$|Flow directionality, valving {{and liquid}} routing in {{centrifugal}} microfluidics (Lab-on-CD) are typically controlled by applying centrifugal and Coriolis forces {{and have been}} the subject of active research interest in recent years. Determining and switching the flow direction at a T-junction is a common fluidic operation important for implementing several chemical and clinical assays for Lab-on-CDs. The present work describes a novel approach to <b>route</b> <b>samples</b> and control flow direction on a spinning disc that employs a guiding microstructure that relies on a two-stage valve comprised of an auxiliary inlet, which is a recess embedded at a T-junction, and a bent auxiliary outlet. The distinctive feature that makes this approach different from other types of passive capillary valves is the strong control of liquid movement, which is achieved by employing two adjustable sequential burst valves called a primary valve and a secondary burst valve. The guiding method can be used to <b>route</b> <b>samples</b> and reagents at given flow rates to a selection of receiving reservoirs, which are determined by the spinning frequency of the disc. The technique also allows for the switching of the flow direction instantaneously from the direction along the disc rotation to the opposite direction by increasing the rotational speed of the disc rather than relying on the Coriolis force, which would require reversing the spin direction. The flow routing by the proposed technique has been studied theoretically, and the flow behavior has been numerically investigated. These studies have been experimentally validated for a wide range of capillary sizes and for various liquids including di-water, mixtures of water and ethanol and bovine serum albumin (BSA) ...|$|R

C_ 2 -C_ 8 dicarboxylic acids showed clear seasonal changes with higher concentration in summer than in winter. This suggested that low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids were produced by photochemical reactions. Concentrations of dicarboxylic acids at Dome Fuji Station were about 20 {{times higher than the}} snow samples collected on the route from Syowa Station to Dome Fuji Station. The concentrations of maleic acid and phthalic acid (derived from photochemical oxidation of anthropogenic aromatic hydrocarbons) at Dome Fuji Station was about 40 times higher than the <b>route</b> <b>samples.</b> In contrast, the concentrations of C_ 8 and C_ 9 diacids (derived from photochemical oxidation of biogenic unsaturated fatty acids) at Dome Fuji Station were only 3 - 5 times higher than the <b>route</b> <b>samples.</b> This comparison suggests that surface snow samples at Dome Fuji Station contained photooxidation products of anthropogenic organic matter, suggesting that the diacids are emitted from incomplete combustion of fossil fuel used at the Station and/or produced in the atmosphere by photooxidation of exhaust gases. On the other hand, concentration ratios of fumaric acid (trans-C_ 4 unsaturated diacid) to maleic acid (cis-C_ 4 unsaturated diacid) showed higher values in summer than in winter, suggesting that cis to trans isomerization occurs photochemically in the atmosphere and possibly in the snow surface.

30|$|In Belgium no {{adequate}} {{sampling frame}} for {{the target population}} was available, but information on the geographical distribution of third-country nationals by statistical wards (Buurten/Quartiers) was accessible for the year 2008, which {{was used as an}} indication of the densities of the target population. The number of TCFBs is almost certainly higher than the number of TCNs, because the former include naturalised immigrants as well. 5 In order to make random selection feasible, a two-stage sampling design was employed. The Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were the statistical wards. In the three cities a number of PSUs were selected proportional to the number of TCNs resident in the ward in 2008, once all PSUs with a percentage of TCNs below 10 % were excluded. In PSUs with more than 18 % TCNs traditional random <b>route</b> <b>sampling</b> was undertaken, whereas in PSUs with lower than 18 % of the target population focused enumeration was employed (Ipsos, 2012). The exclusion of these PSUs was entirely based on cost-efficiency reasons: as it would be very costly and time-consuming to contact the target population in areas with low concentration. Undoubtedly, this introduces the potential for bias should the characteristics of the TCNs residing in areas of lower concentration of immigrants differ from those residing in areas of higher concentration.|$|E
40|$|Contexts {{involving}} {{a very large}} number of choices are traditionally modeled by estimating Multinomial Logit (MNL) models after sampling from the full set of available alternatives. Route choice in typical urban networks may have a large number of alternatives, but MNL is not suitable to model route choice. In addition, the sampling approach introduced by stochastic route-set generation procedures does not satisfy the property of equal selection probability of the choice set generated. Stochastic route set generation is a case of sampling importance because the selection probability of a route depends on the properties of the route itself. This paper presents the calculation of the selection probabilities and generation frequencies of routes when this sampling process is implemented and used for the estimation of route choice models. A correction is shown to be needed only in cases of samples with unequal route selection probability. Both the large sample case and the equal selection probability case can be treated the same, namely without correction for sampling. This also holds for enumeration methods of choice set generation. The results of an experimental <b>route</b> <b>sampling</b> correction are presented for two real datasets. The experiments presented validate the possibility of using unequally sampled choice sets in estimating choice models, while supporting the use of stochastic route generation methods...|$|E

The aim {{of this article is}} to contribute to this body of research by analysing the fertility and partnership histories within the German Generations and Gender Survey (GGS). Although landmark events such as the birth of children or marriage are commonly regarded as reliable memories and therefore are assumed to be applicable retrospectively without much decrement in data quality, we find severe distortions in the {{retrospective data}} on fertility and relationship in the German GGS by comparison to the Microcensus. In fertility histories there is a major overestimation of childless women in older cohorts as well as an underestimation of this group in middleaged cohorts. Regarding partnership history we have too many women never married in the older cohorts and too many married in the younger cohorts. We find that these distortions are mainly attributed to problems caused by survey organisation. The random <b>route</b> <b>sampling</b> procedure of the German GGS has led to problems, as has the instrument, which lacked control mechanisms while simultaneously being very complex. We also find indications of problematic interviewers, but we cannot delete the deviations in the data to our satisfaction as they are bound to be multicausal.

30|$|There is no {{comfortable}} {{choice for}} surveying immigrants in Germany either. As {{long as the}} target population is simply characterized by migration background without further differentiation, established procedures for the entire population, viz. random <b>route</b> <b>sampling</b> and mixed frame telephone interviews, are sufficient. The target population constitutes 21 % of the total population, and screening expenses will often be permissible. When specific groups are targeted, the gold standard consists of a two stage procedure. First, a large sample of cities is selected that covers the diversity of socioeconomic conditions across the country. Second, individuals are drawn from population registers using citizenship, place of birth and name. Though groups like Aussiedler offspring with typical German names fail to be identified, this procedure captures very {{large parts of the}} population with migration background. However, expenses and manpower demand are considerable. Many surveys have implemented more convenient and economically practical schemes, though at the expense of sample quality. Limitation to a few large cities where population registers or area sampling are applied leads to cluster effects and a bias towards metropolitan and more segregated living conditions. When foreign citizenship is substituted for migration background, a massive sampling bias lurks. Telephone directory samples with name-based immigrant recognition are the cheapest variant. Their popularity was high in the past but has declined when the selection frame started to shrink. Today it demands for combination with other techniques such as targeted random dialling. All other techniques are either legally inaccessible for academic researchers or no less laborious.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{deterioration}} of the health status of the Romanian population during the economic transition from a centrally planned to a free market economy {{has been linked to}} lifestyles factors (e. g. diet) regarded as a main determinants of the disparity in life expectancy between Eastern and Western Europe. Reforms in the health care system in this transition economy aim to focus on preventive action. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the factors that impact on the individual decision to engage in Dietary Health Preventive Behaviour (DHPB) and investigate their influence in the context of an adapted health cognition model. Methods A population-based study recruited 485 adult respondents using random <b>route</b> <b>sampling</b> and face-to-face administered questionnaires. Results and discussion Respondents' health motivation, beliefs that diet can prevent disease, knowledge about nutrition, level of education attainment and age have a positive influence on DHPB. Perceived barriers to healthy eating have a negative impact on alcohol moderation. The information acquisition behaviour (frequency of reading food labels) is negatively predicted by age and positively predicted by health motivation, education, self-reported knowledge about nutrition and household financial status. A significant segment of respondents believe they are not susceptible to the elicited diseases. Health promotion strategies should aim to change the judgments of health risk. Conclusion The adaptation of the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Health Preventive Behaviour represents a valid framework of predicting DHPB. The negative sign of perceived threat of disease on DHPB may suggest that, under an income constraint, consumers tend to trade off long-term health benefits for short-term benefits. This cautions against the use of negative messages in public health campaigns. Raising the awareness of diet-disease relationships, knowledge about nutrition (particularly sources and risks associated with dietary fat and cholesterol) may induce people to adopt preventive dietary habits. </p...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Background: Exposure to traffic-related air {{pollution}} may be elevated during commute trips, but could vary with different transportation microenvironments and commuting behavior. Given {{the variety of}} commute options available within urban settings, understanding the potential differences in exposures for different commuter choices has potential implications for health, and may inform individual commuter choices and transportation strategies to reduce exposures. Methods: Black carbon concentrations, a surrogate for traffic-related {{air pollution}}, were measured for a stratified selection of commute trips for different transportation modes and for arterial and local roadways in Seattle, WA. Black carbon concentrations were analyzed to develop an exposure model capable of providing an estimate of commute exposure with respect to route characterization, mode of transportation, time of day, and ambient pollution level. Results: Results generated typical black carbon exposures of commuters in the Seattle area differentiated by variables such as commute time, mode, and <b>route.</b> <b>Sampling</b> data was used to generate three exposure models utilizing these variables to predict an average black carbon exposure concentration based on commute characteristics. Regression model predictions of black carbon exposure significantly differed between transit modes; of all modes included in the models, transit tunnel predictions were highest and walking predictions were lowest. Within-mode comparisons indicate BC exposure predictions for arterial routes are higher than predictions for local/residential routes, are higher between the hours of 6 - 9 am than between the hours of 4 - 6 pm, and increase with increased ambient PM 2. 5 levels. Conclusion: Commute mode and route can impact personal exposure to black carbon. Better understanding of exposure differences for commute modes and routes in Seattle could enable commuters the opportunity to alter commute choices to minimize exposure to black carbon, as well as enable cities and municipalities such as Seattle to consider exposure potential when making decisions about public transportation infrastructure, such as bus type, placement of bus stops, or ventilation in transit tunnels...|$|E
