The calculation starts with laser <b>radar</b> <b>equations</b> representing backscatter {{with and without}} molecular line absorption; the magnitudes of off-line backscatter are demonstrated. Extensive prior data on water line strengths are summarized to indicate the available sensitivity to water vapor concentration. Several lidar situations are considered starting with uniform and perturbed atmospheres at 0, 3, 10 and 20 kM (stratosphere) altitudes. These simulations are indicative of results to be obtained in ground truth measurements (ground-based and airborne). An approximate treatment of polar observations is also given. Vertical atmospheric soundings from orbit and from ground stations are calculated. Errors are discussed as regards their propagation through the lidar equation to render the measured water vapor concentration imprecise; conclusions are given as to required laser energy and feasible altitude resolution...|$|R

30|$|Backscatter {{communication}} is a radar {{approach that is}} different from one-way wireless communication in which the wave propagation channel observes two distinct paths. In the forward path, the RF carrier is emitted from the transmitter and has no information. In the return path, the tag device modulates the tag’s antenna impedance that appeared as a variable radar cross section (RCS) [8]. The backward channel includes the tag-specific information in the form of amplitude or phase modulation of the radiated carrier. The remote receiver decodes the tag antenna reflections and extracts the tag’s data [9]. The modulation level is determined by the number of the loads used in the tag device for switching among [10]. Thus, ultra-low power tag becomes feasible thanks to using an ultra-low power switch device instead of an active transmitter with the power-hungry frontend. The communication link performance can be calculated using <b>Radar</b> <b>equations.</b>|$|R

40|$|The need to {{understand}} the complementarity of the radar and radiometer is important not only to the Tropical Rain Measuring Mission (TRMM) program but to a growing number of multi-instrumented airborne experiment that combine single or dual-frequency radars with multichannel radiometers. The method of analysis used in this study begins with the derivation of dual-wavelength <b>radar</b> <b>equations</b> for the estimation of a two-parameter drop size distribution (DSD). Defining a "storm model" as the set of parameters that characterize snow density, cloud water, water vapor, and features of the melting layer, then to each storm model there will usually correspond a set of range-profiled drop size distributions that are approximate solutions of the <b>radar</b> <b>equations.</b> To test these solutions, a radiative transfer model is used to compute the brightness temperatures for the radiometric frequencies of interest. A storm model or class of storm models is considered optimum if it provides the best reproduction of the radar and radiometer measurements. Tests of the method are made for stratiform rain using simulated storm models as well as measured airborne data. Preliminary results show that the best correspondence between the measured and estimated radar profiles usually can be obtained by using a moderate snow density (0. 1 - 0. 2 g/cu cm), the Maxwell-Garnett mixing formula for partially melted hydrometeors (water matrix with snow inclusions), and low to moderate values of the integrated cloud liquid water (less than 1 kg/sq m). The storm-model parameters that yield the best reproductions of the measured radar reflectivity factors also provide brightness temperatures at 10 GHz that agree well with the measurements. On the other hand, the correspondence between the measured and modeled values usually worsens in going to the higher frequency channels at 19 and 34 GHz. In searching for possible reasons for the discrepancies, It is found that changes in the DSD parameter Mu, the radar constants, or the path-integrated attenuation can affect the high frequency channels significantly. In particular, parameters that cause only modest increases in the median mass diameter of the snow, and which have a minor effect on the radar returns or the low frequency brightness temperature, can produce a strong cooling of the 34 GHz brightness temperature...|$|R

The aim of this work is to provide some numerical analyses on surface clutter interference and part of the performance evaluation for the future implementation of GSWR. The received powers of rain echoes, land and sea surfaces from a radar scattering volume are calculated numerically based on the derived <b>radar</b> <b>equations,</b> assuming a uniform rain layer and appropriate land and sea surface scattering models. An antenna pattern function based on a Bessel curve and Taylor weighting is considered to approximate the realistic spherical antenna of a GSWR. The power ratio of the rain echo signal to clutter (SCR) is then used to evaluate the extension of surface clutter interference. The study demonstrates that the entire region of surface clutter interference in GSWR will be wider than those in tropical rainfall measuring mission precipitation radar (TRMM PR). Most strong surface clutter comes from the antenna mainlobe, and the decrease of clutter contamination through reducing the level of the antenna sidelobe and range sidelobe are not obvious. In addition, the clutter interference is easily affected by rain attenuation in the Ka-band. When rain intensity is greater than 10 mm/h, most of rain echoes at off-nadir scanning angles will not be interfered by surface clutter...|$|R
