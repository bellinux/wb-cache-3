5|$|By 2004, Juniper {{controlled}} 38% of {{the core}} <b>router</b> market. By 2007, it had a 5%, 18% and 30% {{share of the market}} for enterprise, edge and core routers respectively. Alcatel-Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core <b>router</b> market but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers along with Cisco.|$|E
5|$|Juniper Networks' {{first product}} was the Junos <b>router</b> {{operating}} system, which {{was released on}} July 1, 1998. The first Juniper <b>router</b> was made available that September and was a core <b>router</b> for internet service providers called the M40. It incorporated specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM. It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products. The M40 {{was followed by the}} smaller M20 <b>router</b> in December 1999 and the M160 in March 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the BBC and {{commercial}} radio operators launched RadioPlayer which allows over 400 radio stations to be listened to through its website and apps. In addition various {{radio stations and}} third parties allow streaming of internet radio stations through their own websites and apps. A number of British firms, including BT Group, Reciva, Pure Digital, Roberts Radio and Acoustic Energy have brought out Internet radio devices which use the Wi-Fi signal from a <b>router</b> to stream Internet radio stations within range of a Wi-Fi <b>router.</b>|$|E
5000|$|IS-IS {{differs from}} OSPF {{in the way}} that [...] "areas" [...] are defined and routed between. IS-IS <b>routers</b> are {{designated}} as being: Level 1 (intra-area); Level 2 (inter area); or Level 1-2 (both). Routing information is exchanged between Level 1 <b>routers</b> and other Level 1 <b>routers</b> of the same area, and Level 2 <b>routers</b> can only form relationships and exchange information with other Level 2 <b>routers.</b> Level 1-2 <b>routers</b> exchange information with both levels and are used to connect the inter area <b>routers</b> with the intra area <b>routers.</b>|$|R
30|$|The path {{reconstruction}} process {{needs to}} get marked packets from all <b>routers</b> among the attack path. To this end, the marking process should be activated on all <b>routers</b> in the network. However, what the Internet service providers (ISPs) {{need to do is}} limited to updating the <b>router’s</b> IOS and enabling the PPM on the <b>routers.</b> Having said this, ISPs should do this on all <b>routers,</b> including either edge or backbone <b>routers.</b> Indeed, the involvement of all the <b>routers</b> is a major problem of using this method. Given that, in practice it may cross boundaries of ISPs and countries.|$|R
50|$|As of 2016, Stack Exchange {{utilizes}} Fortinet 800c Firewalls, which replaced Cisco 5525-X ASAs. <b>Routers</b> were upgraded from CISCO 3945 <b>routers</b> to CISCO ASR-1001 and AST-1001-x <b>routers.</b>|$|R
5|$|In January 2001, Cisco {{introduced}} {{a suite of}} <b>router</b> products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper's increasing market-share. According to BusinessWeek, Juniper's top-end <b>router</b> was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products. Cisco's routers were not expected to erode Juniper's growing share of the market, but other companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper's routers.|$|E

5|$|The National Telecommunications Commission is {{the agency}} {{responsible}} for the supervision, adjudication and control over all telecommunications services throughout the country. There are approximately 383 AM and 659 FM radio stations and 297 television and 873 cable television stations. On March 29, 1994, the country went live on the Internet via a 64 kbit/s connection from a <b>router</b> serviced by PLDT to a Sprint <b>router</b> in California.

5000|$|Core-based trees (CBT) is a {{proposal}} for making IP Multicast scalable by constructing a tree of <b>routers.</b> It was first proposed in a paper by Ballardie, Francis, and Crowcroft. What differentiates it from other schemes for multicasting is that the routing tree comprises multiple [...] "cores" [...] (also known as [...] "centres"). The locations of the core <b>routers</b> are statically configured. Other <b>routers</b> are added by growing [...] "branches" [...] of a tree, comprising a chain of <b>routers,</b> from the core <b>routers</b> out towards the <b>routers</b> directly adjacent to the multicast group members.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} network-level issues {{that deal with}} the organization, interaction, and {{deployment}} of active <b>routers</b> in a network. We have identified and answered four sets of questions: (i) Where should active <b>routers</b> {{be placed in the}} network? What is the network organization of active <b>routers</b> that achieves a good trade-off between scalability and flexibility? (ii) If all <b>routers</b> in the network are not active, then how can we abstract the state of the "non-active" portion of the network for services that reside in active <b>routers?</b> (iii) How do active <b>routers</b> discover and communicate with, other active <b>routers?</b> What is the infrastructure for the management, discovery, and communication of active <b>routers?</b> (iv) How do users discover the available (third party) active services in the network? What is the infrastructure for the dissemination, discovery, and composition of active services?

5|$|The {{first product}} {{release of the}} MX series was the MX960, a 14-slot, 480 Gbit/s switch and <b>router.</b> In late 2006, Juniper {{introduced}} the MX240 and MX480, which are smaller versions of the 960. They had a throughput of 240 Gbit/s and 480 Gbit/s respectively.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Thordendal, who {{was working}} as a carpenter, severed the tip of his left middle finger, while Haake injured his hand in a <b>router</b> accident. As a result, the band was unable to perform for several months. Thordendal's {{fingertip}} was later reattached, and he went on to make a full recovery. The Selfcaged EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) in Fort Polk, Louisiana, Manning was {{deployed}} to Forward Operating Base Hammer, near Baghdad, arriving in October 2009. From her workstation there, she {{had access to}} SIPRNet (the Secret Internet Protocol <b>Router</b> Network) and JWICS (the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System). Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq; it was felt she was a risk to herself and possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army—but the shortage of intelligence analysts dictated their decision to take her. In November 2009, she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist.|$|E

40|$|Routing {{infrastructure}} plays a {{vital role}} in the Internet, and attacks on <b>routers</b> can be damaging in numerous ways. Compromised <b>routers</b> can drop, modify, mis-forward or reorder valid packets. However, existing proposals for secure forwarding require substantial computational overhead and additional capabilities at <b>routers.</b> We propose Secure Split Assignment Trajectory Sampling (SATS), a system that detects malicious <b>routers</b> on the data plane. SATS locates a set of suspicious <b>routers</b> when packets do not follow their predicted paths. SATS works with a traffic measurement platform using packet sampling, has low overhead on <b>routers</b> and is applicable to high-speed networks. Different subsets of packets are sampled over different groups of <b>routers</b> (called Split Range Assignment) to ensure attackers cannot completely evade detection. Our evaluation shows that SATS can significantly limit a malicious <b>router’s</b> harm to a small portion of traffic in a network. I...|$|R

5|$|In March 2013, Juniper {{released}} the EX9200 switch, which isn't {{part of the}} MX Series, but uses the same software and Trio chipset. A virtualized MX series 3D <b>router,</b> the vMX 3D, was introduced in November 2014. A suite of updates were announced in late 2015. New MPC line cards were introduced, which have a throughput of up to 1.6 Tbit/s. Simultaneously the Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) was announced. JET is a programming interface for integrating third-party applications that automate provisioning, maintenance and other tasks. The Junos Telemetry Interface was also announced at the same time. It reports data to applications and other equipment to automate changes to the network in response to faults or in order optimize performance.|$|E
5|$|Juniper Networks had $3.8 {{million in}} annual revenue in 1998. By the {{following}} year, its only product, the M40 <b>router,</b> was being used by 50 telecommunications companies. Juniper Networks signed agreements with Alcatel and Ericsson to distribute the M40 internationally. A European headquarters {{was established in the}} United Kingdom and an Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. A subsidiary was created in Japan and offices were established in Korea in 1999. Juniper Networks's market share for core routers grew from 6% in 1998 to 17.5% one year later, and 20% by April 2000.|$|E
5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major <b>router</b> applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core routers {{was when it}} entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband. The product family was discontinued later that year.|$|E
50|$|PEs {{understand}} the topology of each VPN, which are interconnected with MPLS tunnels, {{either directly or}} via P <b>routers.</b> In MPLS terminology, the P <b>routers</b> are Label Switch <b>Routers</b> without awareness of VPNs.|$|R
5000|$|The worm {{began to}} be noticed early on 25 January 2003 as it slowed down systems worldwide. The {{slowdown}} {{was caused by the}} collapse of numerous <b>routers</b> under the burden of extremely high bombardment traffic from infected servers. Normally, when traffic is too high for <b>routers</b> to handle, the <b>routers</b> are supposed to delay or temporarily stop network traffic. Instead, some <b>routers</b> crashed (became unusable), and the [...] "neighbour" [...] <b>routers</b> would notice that these <b>routers</b> had stopped and should not be contacted (aka [...] "removed from the routing table"). <b>Routers</b> started sending notices to this effect to other <b>routers</b> they knew about. The flood of routing table update notices caused some additional <b>routers</b> to fail, compounding the problem. Eventually the crashed routers' maintainers restarted them, causing them to announce their status, leading to another wave of routing table updates. Soon a significant portion of Internet bandwidth was consumed by <b>routers</b> communicating with each other to update their routing tables, and ordinary data traffic slowed down or in some cases stopped altogether. Ironically, because the SQL Slammer worm was so small in size, sometimes it was able to get through when legitimate traffic was not.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} secure routing {{protocol}} that is immune to Sybil attacks {{and that can}} tolerate collusion of Byzantine <b>routers.</b> It can tolerate either initial collusion of Byzantine <b>routers</b> or runtime collusion of non-adjacent Byzantine <b>routers,</b> both {{in the absence of}} runtime collusion between adjacent <b>routers.</b> For these settings, the calculated distance from a destination to a node is not smaller than the actual shortest distance from the destination to the node. The protocol can also simultaneously tolerate initial collusion of Byzantine <b>routers</b> and runtime collusion of adjacent Byzantine <b>routers</b> but in the absence of runtime collusion between non-adjacent <b>routers.</b> For this setting, it guarantees a bound on the difference between the calculated distance and the actual shortest distance. The bound depends on the number of Byzantine <b>routers</b> on a path. The protocol makes very weak timing assumptions and requires synchronization only between neighbors or second neighbors. We propose to use this protocol for secure localization of <b>routers</b> using hop-count distances, which can be then used as a proof of identity of nodes. close 0...|$|R
5|$|In 2012, the {{government}} of New York City installed Wi-Fi routers at 10 payphones in the city (seven in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, and one in Queens) {{as part of a}} pilot project. The Wi-Fi was free of charge and available for use at all times. The Wi-Fi signal was detectable from a radius of a few hundred feet (about 100m). Two of New York City's largest advertising companies—Van Wagner and Titan, who collectively owned more than 9,000 of New York City's 12,000 payphones at the time—paid $2,000 per <b>router,</b> with no monetary input from either the city or taxpayers. While the payphones participating in the Wi-Fi pilot project were poorly marked, the Wi-Fi offered at these payphones was significantly faster than some of the other free public Wi-Fi networks offered elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the four <b>router</b> types, OSPF uses the terms designated <b>router</b> (DR) and backup designated <b>router</b> (BDR), which are attributes of a <b>router</b> interface.|$|E

50|$|<b>Routers</b> {{that use}} network address {{translation}} (NAT) must maintain tables of source and destination IP addresses and ports. Typical home <b>routers</b> are limited to about 2000 table entries while some more expensive <b>routers</b> have larger table capacities. BitTorrent frequently contacts 20-30 servers per second, rapidly filling the NAT tables. This is a known cause of some home <b>routers</b> ceasing to work correctly.|$|R
5000|$|Netgear <b>routers</b> {{commonly}} offer {{a choice}} of two implementations of RIPv2; these are labelled RIP_2M and RIP_2B. RIP_2M is the standard RIPv2 implementation using multicasting - which requires all <b>routers</b> on the network to support RIPv2 and multicasting, whereas RIP_2B sends RIPv2 packets using subnet broadcasting - making it more compatible with <b>routers</b> that do not support multicasting, including RIPv1 <b>routers.</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>router</b> may {{be mounted}} {{upside down in}} a <b>router</b> table or bench. The router's base plate is mounted to the {{underside}} of the table, with a hole allowing the bit to protrude above the table top. This allows the work to be passed over the <b>router,</b> rather than passing the <b>router</b> over the work. This has benefits when working with smaller objects and makes some <b>router</b> operations safer to execute. A <b>router</b> table may be fitted with a fence, fingerboards and other work-guiding accessories to make the operation safer and more accurate.|$|E
25|$|The <b>router</b> {{table is}} usually {{oriented}} so that the <b>router</b> bit is vertical and the table over which the work is passed is horizontal. Variations on this include the horizontal <b>router</b> table, in which the table remains horizontal but the <b>router</b> is mounted vertically above the table, so that the <b>router</b> bit cuts from the side. This is an alternative for edge operations, such as panel raising and slot cutting.|$|E
25|$|A robotic CNC <b>router</b> is a {{computer}} controlled robotic arm in which the <b>router</b> or spindle {{is part of a}} head mounted {{to the end of the}} robot arm. The main difference between a CNC <b>router</b> and a robotic <b>router</b> is the ability to <b>router</b> using a 4,5 or 6-axis coordinate system because of the rotation allowed by the joints in the robot arm as well as the rotation of the head that the <b>router</b> spindle is mounted to. CAD/CAM software programming can be used to indicate the part location, which is usually fixed to an immobile table and clamped in place. The robotic <b>router</b> trimming process then follows a programmed path for <b>router</b> cutting to create a part from a blank or more commonly- to trim the flashing from a molded part to complete the finishing process that in the past, was a manual process.|$|E
