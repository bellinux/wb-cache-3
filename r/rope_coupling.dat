40|$|In a {{high-rise}} elevator system lateral vibrations of the suspension and compensating <b>ropes,</b> <b>coupled</b> with vertical {{motions of the}} car and counterweight are induced by the building structure motions. When the frequency of the building coincides with the fundamental natural frequency of the ropes, large resonance whirling motions of the ropes result. This phenomenon leads to impacts of the ropes on the elevator walls, large displacements {{of the car and}} counterweight making the building and elevator system unsafe. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model of {{a high-rise}} elevator system taking into account the combined lateral stiffness of the roller guides and guide rails. The results and analysis presented in the paper demonstrate frequency curve veering phenomena and a wide range of resonances that occur in the system. A case study is presented when the car is parked at a landing level where the fundamental natural frequencies of the car, suspension and compensating rope system coincide with one of the natural frequencies of the high-rise building. The results show a range of nonlinear dynamic interactions between the components of the elevator system that {{play a significant role in}} the operation of the entire installation...|$|R

The calibration of the models has been performed comparing the theoretical hysteresis cycles with the experimental ones obtained with a seismic isolator test rig.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a model to}} {{describe}} the lateral dynamic behaviour of long moving ropes employed in high-rise vertical transportation is developed. The model {{takes into account the}} fact that the longitudinal elastic stretching of the <b>ropes</b> is <b>coupled</b> with their transverse motions (sway) which results in cubic nonlinear terms. The governing non-stationary nonlinear equations are solved numerically to investigate the passage through resonance conditions arising during the system operation. The active stiffness control of transverse vibrations of the ropes is discussed. This involves the application of a longitudinal action at the rope end. The results of numerical simulation tests demonstrate the ability of multimodal active control to reduce non-linear low frequency sway of the ropes during and after the passage through resonanc...|$|R

40|$|Coupled lateral and {{longitudinal}} vibrations of {{suspension and}} compensating ropes in a high-rise lift system are often {{induced by the}} building motions due to wind or seismic excitations. When the frequencies of the building become near the natural frequencies of the ropes, large resonance motions of the system may result. This leads to adverse coupled dynamic phenomena involving nonplanar motions of the ropes, impact loads between the ropes and the shaft walls, as well as vertical vibrations of the car, counterweight and compensating sheave. Such an adverse dynamic behaviour of the system endangers {{the safety of the}} installation. This paper presents two mathematical models describing the nonlinear responses of a suspension/ compensating <b>rope</b> system <b>coupled</b> with the elevator car / compensating sheave motions. The models accommodate the nonlinear couplings between the lateral and longitudinal modes, with and without longitudinal inertia of the ropes. The partial differential nonlinear equations of motion are derived using Hamilton Principle. Then, the Galerkin method is used to discretise the equations of motion and to develop a nonlinear ordinary differential equation model. Approximate numerical solutions are determined and the behaviour of the system is analysed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The thermal {{properties}} of carbon nanotubes display {{a wide range}} of behaviors which are related both to their graphitic nature and their unique struc-ture and size. The specific heat of individual nanotubes should be similar to that of two-dimensional graphene at high temperatures, with the effects of phonon quan-tization becoming apparent at lower temperatures. Inter-tube <b>coupling</b> in SWNT <b>ropes,</b> and interlayer <b>coupling</b> in MWNTs, should cause their low-temperature spe-cific heat to resemble that of three-dimensional graphite. Experimental data on SWNTs show relatively weak inter-tube coupling, and are in good agreement with theoretical models. The specific heat of MWNTs has not been examined theoret-ically in detail. Experimental results on MWNTs show a temperature dependent specific heat which is consistent with weak inter-layer coupling, although different measurements show slightly different temperature dependences. The thermal con-ductivity of both SWNTs and MWNTs should reflect the on-tube phonon structure, regardless of tube-tube coupling. Measurements of the thermal conductivity of bulk samples show graphite-like behavior for MWNTs but quite different behavior fo...|$|R
40|$|A plasma loop twisted Riemannian {{model is}} applied to torus dynamos twisted flows it leading to a slow dynamo such as in Moebius strip dynamo, {{recently}} considered by Shukurov, Stepanov and Sokoloff [Phys. Rev. E 78, 025301,(2008) ] to modelling Perm dynamo torus in liquid sodium. Since diffusion and advection (stretching), are competing effects for dynamo action, plasma resistivity term is shown to be proportional to loops Riemann curvature (folding). Shukurov et al, also showed that based on Ponomarenko dynamo, a broader torus channel produces a better dynamo. These results agree with Schekochihin et al [Phys Rev E (2002) ] where random filamentary magnetic fields are strengthen by curvature. Analysis of spectrum of chaotic fast dynamos, shows that Riemann curvature acts as a damping, since growth magnetic field rate is inversely proportional to Riemann curvature. Comparison with general relativistic MHD dynamo equation, shows that the Ricci tensor, which is a contraction of the Riemann tensor also appears in the diffusion term. Curvature of plasma loop is R^ 1 _ 212 |_Plasma≈ 5. 6 × 10 ^- 19 m^- 2, while for Perm torus is certainly higher. Thus slow dynamos are favoured in dynamo laboratories rather than in plasma loops. It is shown that the curvature-stretching flux <b>rope</b> dynamo <b>coupling</b> energy, coincides with the minimum twist energy ϵ_twist≈ 10 ^ 30 TeV stored in flux ropes. Torus flux tubes around black-holes remain {{in the order of}} 2 MeV and GBR are around 10 ^ 52 TeV.

40|$|Long moving {{vertical}} {{ropes and}} cables {{are used in}} various engineering systems. In particular, in high-rise structures traction drive elevators they are employed {{as a means of}} car and counterweight suspension and for compensation of tensile forces over the traction sheave. Also, ropes are applied in the elevator governor systems to activate the safety gear in order to bring the car and counterweight safely to rest in the event of emergency and failure of the normal stopping system. An adverse situation arises when the host structure is excited near its fundamental natural frequency and vibrates harmonically. This often results in a passage through resonance conditions in the rope system when the slowly varying natural frequencies of the ropes approach the frequency of the inertial load resulting from the building sway. The nature of such a loading is usually nondeterministic and it is necessary to apply stochastic models to analyze the dynamic responses of the ropes. In this paper a model to describe the lateral dynamic behaviour of a vertical moving rope is developed. The model takes into account the fact that the longitudinal elastic stretching of the <b>ropes</b> is <b>coupled</b> with their transverse motions which results in cubic nonlinear terms. The governing nonstationary nonlinear equations are then solved numerically to investigate the passage through resonance conditions arising during the elevator travel. Then, the methodology to account for the stochastic nature of the building sway is discussed and the differential equations governing the second-order statistical moments of the state vector are developed. The stochastic differential equations are treated numerically to predict the variance of the rope response...|$|R
40|$|Context. Coronal mass ejections (CME’s) {{are one of}} {{the most}} violent {{phenomena}} found on the Sun. One model to explain their occurrence is the flux rope ejection model. In this model, magnetic flux ropes form slowly over time periods of days to weeks. They then lose equilibrium and are ejected from the solar corona over a few hours. The contrasting time scales of formation and ejection pose a serious problem for numerical simulations. Aims. We simulate the whole life span of a flux rope from slow formation to rapid ejection and investigate whether magnetic flux ropes formed from a continuous magnetic field distribution, during a quasi-static evolution, can erupt to produce a CME. Methods. To model the full life span of magnetic flux <b>ropes</b> we <b>couple</b> two models. The global non-linear force-free field (GNLFFF) evolution model is used to follow the quasi-static formation of a flux rope. The MHD code ARMVAC is used to simulate the production of a CME through the loss of equilibrium and ejection of this flux rope. Results. We show that the two distinct models may be successfully coupled and that the flux rope is ejected out of our simulation box, where the outer boundary is placed at 2. 5 R⊙. The plasma expelled during the flux rope ejection travels outward at a speed of 100 km[*]s- 1, which is consistent with the observed speed of CMEs in the low corona. Conclusions. Our work shows that flux ropes formed in the GNLFFF can lead to the ejection of a mass loaded magnetic flux rope in full MHD simulations. Coupling the two distinct models opens up a new avenue of research to investigate phenomena where different phases of their evolution occur on drastically different time scales.

During a [...] "great storm," [...] a huge wave swept away their sea anchors and most of their supplies. The Uncle Sam was swamped and filled with water but was kept afloat, due to its design, containing watertight compartments. After days of misery in the flooded vessel, suffering injury and illness, the Captain spotted the sails of a passing ship and, rigging a temporary storm sail, gave chase. After a desperate hour, someone on the ship spotted The Uncle Sam in tow and gave the alarm. The crew of the Queen Of Nations, a high-speed clipper ship out of Australia, threw a <b>rope</b> to the <b>couple</b> in their derelict boat and hauled them aboard.

Some of these planks did young Cartouche remove; and having descended by means of a <b>rope,</b> tied a <b>couple</b> of others to the neck of the honey-pots, climbed back again, and drew up his prey in safety. He then cunningly fixed the planks again in their old places, and retired to gorge himself upon his booty. And, now, see the punishment of avarice! Everybody knows that the brethren of the order of Jesus are bound by a vow to have no more than a certain small sum of money in their possession. The principal of the college of Clermont had amassed a larger sum, in defiance of this rule: and where do you think the old gentleman had hidden it? In the honey-pots! As Cartouche dug his spoon into one of them, he brought out, besides a quantity of golden honey, a couple of golden louis, which, with ninety-eight more of their fellows, were comfortably hidden in the pots. Little Dominic, who, before, had cut rather a poor figure among his fellow-students, now appeared in as fine clothes as any of them could boast of; and when asked by his parents, on going home, how he came by them, said that a young nobleman of his schoolfellows had taken a violent fancy to him, and made him a present of a couple of his suits. Cartouche the elder, good man, went to thank the young nobleman; but none such could be found, and young Cartouche disdained to give any explanation of his manner of gaining the money.|$|R
