This is especially true of birds that are commonly held as pets, such as parrots and finches.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{has been}} domesticated for {{hundreds}} of years. It has been bred into several varieties kept by hobbyists, of which the best known is the homing pigeon or racing homer. Other popular breeds are tumbling pigeons such as the Birmingham roller, and fancy varieties that are bred for certain physical characteristics such as large feathers on the feet or fan-shaped tails. Domesticated rock pigeons are also bred as carrier pigeons, used {{for thousands of years}} to carry brief written messages, and release doves used in ceremonies. White doves are also commonly used in magic acts.|$|E
5|$|Opportunistic {{and highly}} adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet {{markedly}} depending on available food sources. They {{have been recorded}} taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark (Alauda arvensis), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), <b>rock</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba livia), and Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto). A field study of a large city dump {{on the outskirts of}} León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism.

25|$|Yala {{is one of}} the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 {{bird species}} of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed {{bee-eater}} and brown-capped babbler. The number of waterbirds inhabiting wetlands of Yala is 90 and half of them are migrants. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck, garganey), cormorants (little cormorant, Indian cormorant), large waterbirds (grey heron, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, Asian openbill, painted stork), medium-sized waders Tringa spp., and small waders Charadrius spp. are among the most common waterbirds. Black-necked stork and lesser adjutant are many of the rare birds that {{can be seen in the}} park. The migrant great white pelican and resident spot-billed pelican are also have been recorded. Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, godwits, and ruddy turnstone. The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew. <b>Rock</b> <b>pigeon,</b> barred buttonquail, Indian peafowl, black stork, black-winged stilt, and greater flamingo are among the other bird species. Crested serpent eagle and white-bellied sea eagle are the raptors of the park. The forest birds are orange-breasted green pigeon, hornbills, Old World flycatchers, Indian paradise flycatcher, Asian barbets, and orioles.|$|E

500|$|Chapter I covers animal {{husbandry}} and plant breeding, {{going back to}} ancient Egypt. Darwin discusses contemporary opinions {{on the origins of}} different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding. As an illustration of artificial selection, he describes fancy pigeon breeding, noting that [...] "he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing", yet all were descended from one species of <b>rock</b> <b>pigeon.</b> Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called [...] "sports" [...] or [...] "monstrosities" [...] (example: Ancon sheep with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons). Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders. However, for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution.|$|E

500|$|The peregrine's {{breeding}} range includes land regions from the Arctic tundra to the tropics. It {{can be found}} nearly everywhere on Earth, except extreme polar regions, very high mountains, and most tropical rainforests; the only major ice-free landmass from which it is entirely absent is New Zealand. This makes it the world's most widespread raptor, {{and one of the}} most widely found bird species. In fact, the only land-based bird species found over a larger geographic area is not always naturally occurring, but one widely introduced by humans, the <b>rock</b> <b>pigeon,</b> which in turn now supports many peregrine populations as a prey species. The peregrine is a highly successful example of urban wildlife in much of its range, taking advantage of tall buildings as nest sites and an abundance of prey such as pigeons and ducks. Both the English and scientific names of this species mean [...] "wandering falcon," [...] referring to the migratory habits of many northern populations. Experts recognize 17 to 19 subspecies, which vary in appearance and range; disagreement exists over whether the distinctive Barbary falcon is represented by two subspecies of Falco peregrinus, or is a separate species, F. pelegrinoides. The two species' divergence is relatively recent, during the time of the last ice age, therefore the genetic differential between them (and also the difference in their appearance) is relatively small. They are only about 0.6–0.8% genetically differentiated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{terrestrial}} aviary {{was opened}} in 1992, but was closed {{within a few}} years due to maintenance issues. It was renovated and reopened in 2010 as the Bio Centre. This [...] walk-through aviary cost about [...] 2 million and is located on a slope behind the tiger house (...) [...] The aviary is the biggest such facility in a zoo in the country. The facility features fifteen-metre-tall fences to facilitate free flight of birds within the area. The aviary is home to about 245 birds of different species including Alexandrine parakeet, rose-ringed parakeet, blue <b>rock</b> <b>pigeon,</b> common myna, Indian koel, common babbler, white-browed bulbul, francolin, red-vented bulbul, red-whiskered bulbul, wagtail, pipit, orange-headed thrush, red-wattled lapwing, little brown dove and spotted dove. The height of the aviary ranges from [...] {{at the top of the}} slope to [...] at the bottom, with the chain link 'roof' sloping downward from west to east. The aviary is surrounded by a [...] wall, and the four sides above this are covered with steel and blue-coloured nylon net in order to provide an open-sky effect. The ground is floored by tiled footpath lawned with Korean grass to maintain the humidity level. The moist deciduous habitat supports 22 tree and shrub species. Fruit-bearing trees such as mango, pomegranate, guava, sapota (Sapodilla), jamoon, Singapore cherry and chillies have been planted for the benefit of fruit-eating birds. Heaps of dry leaves, dung, dry wood waste and rotten fruits have been provided for insect-eating birds. The zoo has also set up a mud bath facility for the birds. Palm trees with holes have been planted to facilitate natural breeding of parakeets, and heaps of stones have been provided for ground-nesting birds. The aviary also has fountains and water bodies for the birds.|$|E
2500|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl may hunt {{at least}} 300 species of bird. In Europe, {{the most common}} avian prey species are the {{normally}} feral or domestic [...] rock pigeons (Columba livia), although the [...] common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) can be locally even more significant. In the Netherlands, the common wood pigeon {{is the most important}} prey species, making up 37.3% by number and 38.3% by biomass. Yet another, smaller study of the Netherlands found the <b>rock</b> <b>pigeon</b> to be the primary prey species. In a dietary study from Luxembourg, the common wood pigeon was the most frequent prey species, making 19% of the remains by number. A study from Romania listed the <b>rock</b> <b>pigeon</b> was the second most frequently recorded prey behind only the Romanian hamster and the largest contributed of biomass. Unusually, in the Netherlands, birds were the primary food in both number (77.6%) and biomass (72%). Also, in Luxembourg, eagle-owls hunted birds in general were more regularly than mammals, as nearly 70% of prey remains there were avian. At least six other species of pigeon and dove have also been recorded as prey. However, perhaps the most significant contributor of prey at the family level is the corvids. The [...] carrion crow (Corvus corone) is the second most widely recorded avian prey species in Europe and, locally, good numbers are also taken of [...] hooded crow (Corvus cornix), [...] western jackdaws (Corvus monedula), [...] Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius), [...] common ravens (Corvus corax), [...] rooks (Corvus corone), two species each of magpie and chough and the [...] spotted nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes), in rough descending order of reportage in the eagle-owl’s diet. In Baden-Württemberg, Germany, the carrion crow was the most frequently recorded bird among an exceptionally diverse recorded prey base including than 65 bird species there (although birds only comprised 27% of the prey numbers overall). Unlike smaller passerines, corvids roost in numbers in relatively open spots, which make them fairly vulnerable to a predator as stealthy and powerful as the eagle-owl. [...] More than 17 species of gamebirds have been recorded in the Eurasian eagle-owl’s diet but they are normally taken in small numbers. There are, however, exceptions. In one study conducted in lower Austria, the most frequently identified prey species was the [...] grey partridge (Perdix perdix), which is the most widely reported gamebird prey for eagle-owls in Europe. One study of a “primeval” forested region of Finland found various grouse species to be the most significant contributor of biomass, namely in descending order the [...] western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), the [...] black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the [...] hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). In inland areas of Norway, the large forest grouse were also significant biomass contributors. The same forest grouse species were also found to be significant to diet along the Pechora River in Russia. Other gamebirds can be important secondary prey species in different parts of Europe: the [...] red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) in western Europe, the [...] rock partridge (Alectoris graeca) and the [...] rock ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) in alpine highlands, the [...] ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) in eastern Europe and the [...] willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) in the sub-Arctic zone. In Turkey, the most significant prey by number was the [...] chukar (Alectoris chukar), comprising 20.5% of remains. A Korean study in two habitat types (forest and field) found that ring-necked pheasants were the main prey species, making up an average of 19.33% by number and 34.81% by biomass. Other birds of prey are perhaps second only to pigeons and corvids amongst avian contributors to the diet (their ecological relationships with eagle-owls are explored in more detail below).|$|E

6000|$|On the 15th December {{one of the}} Midgan or Serviles {{was tried}} for {{stealing}} venison {{from one of his}} fellows. The Sultan, before his departure, had commissioned three of Lieutenant Speke's attendants to act as judges in case of such emergency: on this occasion the interpreter was on the Woolsack, and he sensibly fined the criminal two sheep to be eaten on the road. From inquiries, I have no doubt that these Midgan are actually reduced by famine at times to live on a food which human nature abhors. In {{the northern part of the}} Somali country I never heard of cannibalism, although the Servile tribes will eat birds and other articles of food disdained by Somal of gentle blood. Lieutenant Speke complains of the scarcity and the quality of the water, [...] "which resembles the mixture commonly known as black draught." [...] Yet it appears not to injure health; and the only disease found endemic is an ophthalmia, said to return periodically every three years.

60|$|So far, {{the facts}} of palaeontology are {{consistent}} with almost any form {{of the doctrine of}} progressive modification; they would not be absolutely inconsistent with the wild speculations of De Maillet, or with the less objectionable hypothesis of Lamarck. But Mr. Darwin's views have one peculiar merit; and that is, that they are perfectly consistent with an array of facts which are utterly inconsistent with and fatal to, any other hypothesis of progressive modification which has yet been advanced. It is one remarkable peculiarity of Mr. Darwin's hypothesis that it involves no necessary progression or incessant modification, and that it is perfectly consistent with the persistence {{for any length of time}} of a given primitive stock, contemporaneously with its modifications. To return to the case of the domestic breeds of pigeons, for example; you have the Dove-cot pigeon, which closely resembles the <b>Rock</b> <b>pigeon,</b> from which they all started, existing at the same time with the others. And if species are developed in the same way in nature, a primitive stock and its modifications may, occasionally, all find the conditions fitted for their existence; and though they come into competition, to a certain extent, with one another, the derivative species may not necessarily extirpate the primitive one, or 'vice versa'.|$|E
6000|$|From {{the summit}} of Koralay, we had a fair view of the {{surrounding}} country. At least forty kraals, many of them deserted, lay {{within the range of}} sight. On all sides except the north-west and south-east was a mass of sombre rock and granite hill: the course of the valleys between the several ranges was denoted by a lively green, and the plains scattered in patches over the landscape shone with dull yellow, the effect of clay and stubble, whilst a light mist encased the prospect in a circlet of blue and silver. Here the End of Time conceived the jocose idea of crowning me king of the country. With loud cries of Buh! Buh! Buh! he showered leaves of a gum tree and a little water from a prayer bottle over my head, and then with all solemnity bound on the turban. [35] It is perhaps fortunate that this facetiousness was not witnessed: a crowd of Bedouins assembled below the hill, suspecting as usual some magical practices, and, had they known the truth, our journey might have ended abruptly.

5000|$|Today, {{more than}} 1,532 {{passenger}} pigeon skins (along with 16 skeletons) are in existence, spread across many institutions {{all over the}} world. It {{has been suggested that}} the passenger pigeon should be revived when available technology allows it (a concept which has been termed [...] "de-extinction"), using genetic material from such specimens. In 2003, the Pyrenean ibex (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica, a subspecies of the Spanish ibex) was the first extinct animal to be cloned back to life; the clone lived for only seven minutes before dying of lung defects. A hindrance to cloning the passenger pigeon {{is the fact that the}} DNA of museum specimens has been contaminated and fragmented, due to exposure to heat and oxygen. American geneticist George M. Church has proposed that the passenger pigeon genome can be reconstructed by piecing together DNA fragments from different specimens. The next step would be to splice these genes into the stem cells of <b>rock</b> <b>pigeons</b> (or band-tailed pigeons), which would then be transformed into egg and sperm cells, and placed into the eggs of <b>rock</b> <b>pigeons,</b> resulting in <b>rock</b> <b>pigeons</b> bearing passenger pigeon sperm and eggs.
