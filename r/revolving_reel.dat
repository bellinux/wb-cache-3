50|$|Patrick Bell of Scotland {{created a}} reaper that used a <b>revolving</b> <b>reel,</b> cutting knife and canvas {{conveyor}} in 1828. This machine was used around his county and some {{may have been}} exported, but the device was never patented. One of Bell's reaping machines is preserved in the National Museum of Rural Life in Scotland.|$|E
5000|$|Combines are {{equipped}} with removable heads that are designed for particular crops. The standard header, sometimes called a grain platform, {{is equipped with a}} reciprocating knife cutter bar, and features a <b>revolving</b> <b>reel</b> with metal or plastic teeth to cause the cut crop to fall into the auger once it is cut. A variation of the platform, a [...] "flex" [...] platform, is similar but has a cutter bar that can flex over contours and ridges to cut soybeans that have pods close to the ground. A flex head can cut soybeans as well as cereal crops, while a rigid platform is generally used only in cereal grains.|$|E
50|$|Historically, all slot {{machines}} used <b>revolving</b> mechanical <b>reels</b> to display and determine results. Although the original slot machine used five reels, simpler, {{and therefore more}} reliable, three reel machines quickly became the standard.|$|R
50|$|This {{reaping machine}} used a <b>revolving</b> 12 vane <b>reel</b> {{to pull the}} crop over the cutting knife, that was made from {{triangular}} reciprocating blades over fixed triangular blades. A canvas conveyor moved the grain and stalks to the side in a windrow. This machine was pushed by livestock and ran on 2 wheels.|$|R
50|$|A hollow ball in latex {{revolves}} around a metallic mast (1,70m high) which is linked by a nylon thread (fishing thread type) of 1,70m length. The thread is knotted to the mast by a loop or a plastic ring freely <b>revolving</b> around a <b>reel.</b> The mast is fixed in a base from 40 kg to 90 kg. The ball is elliptic and is {{hit with a}} rigid plastic racquet with a small handle and a strings around 25 cm of diameter. The speed-ball court is about 6x4 m. for the single match and 8x6 m. for the doubles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic idea}} of most surfcasting is {{to cast a}} bait or lure as far out into the water as is {{necessary}} to reach the target fish from the shore. This {{may or may not}} require long casting distances. Basic surf fishing can be done with a fishing rod between 7 feet and 18 feet long, with an extended butt section, equipped with a suitably-sized spinning or conventional (<b>revolving</b> spool) casting <b>reel.</b> In addition to rod and reel, the surf fisherman needs terminal tackle and bait or lure. Terminal tackle is the equipment {{at the far end of}} the line: hooks, swivels, lines and leaders.|$|R
