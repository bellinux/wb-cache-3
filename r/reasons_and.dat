40|$|It is my {{contention}} that Kant makes an apparent contradiction in Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone {{with respect to}} the relationship between <b>reason</b> <b>and</b> Scripture. At the outset of Religion Kant states that he aims to discover whether reason can be found to be compatible and at one with Scripture. Kant goes about showing that <b>reason</b> <b>and</b> Scripture are united, however, he also maintains that <b>reason</b> <b>and</b> Scripture are distinct from each other. Hence, he seems to land himself in a contradiction. It is my intention to examine this apparent contradiction to see how and why Kant both unites <b>and</b> distinguishes <b>reason</b> <b>and</b> Scripture, and to see whether this contradiction poses a problem or is necessary to Kant's task...|$|R

5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these <b>reasons,</b> <b>and</b> also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the second}} least {{reactive}} noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> {{the small size of}} helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|In September rumours {{were already}} {{circulating}} among the evacuees, and in Gibraltar, {{that the possibility}} of re-evacuating the Gibraltarians once more was being mooted, this time the destination being Jamaica, in the West Indies. After much contention, it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island, and 1,093 evacuees left for Jamaica direct, on 9 October, with more following later on. However petitions followed and the demands were met, partly for strategic <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> the lack of available shipping. The situation at the end of 1940, therefore, was that approximately 2,000 evacuees were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira, with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the London area.|$|E
5|$|In the infancy of the hacker {{subculture}} and {{the computer}} underground, criminal convictions were rare because there was an informal code of ethics {{that was followed by}} white hat hackers. Proponents of hacking claim to be motivated by artistic and political ends, but are often unconcerned about the use of criminal means to achieve them. White hat hackers break past computer security for non-malicious <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> do no damage, akin to breaking into a house and looking around.
