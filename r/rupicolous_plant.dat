40|$|ABSTRACT Capparis spinosa (L.) Mill. subsp. rupestris (Sm.) Nyman is {{a typical}} <b>rupicolous</b> <b>plant</b> ofthe Mediterranean region. The fruit is an ovoid berry blooming, when ripe, with a {{longitudinal}} fissure ofthe exocarp on the dorsal side. Seeds are small, kidney-shaped and dark brown, and are embedded in a white juicy pulp. Fruits are eaten by several animals such as lizards, birds and mice whose droppings enable seed dispersal. Normally lìttle ants remove the pulp from the seeds which remain inside the exocarp for 2 to 7 days. Both seeds from the exocarp and from animaI droppings are carried into the cracks of the rocks by bigger ants. During the summer seeds break physiological dormancy, and germination percentage reaches 98...|$|E
40|$|The <b>rupicolous</b> <b>plant</b> {{communities}} of the Moroccan Rif and Atlas Mountains and the Algerian Djurjura Mountains have been studied in this contribution. The structure and floristic composition of these plant communities are described according to the phytosociological methodology. The following seven new syntaxa are described: Saxifrago tricrenatae-Poetum ligulatae and Saxifrago globuliferae-Seslerietum argenteae from the Western Rif; Drabo hispanicae-Pterocephaletum kunkeliani from the Eastern Rif; Saxifrago globuliferae-Geranietum cataractari from the Middle Atlas; Arabido alpinae-Festucetum atlanticae from the High Atlas; Centaureo benoistii-Galietum ephedroides from the Saharan Atlas and Poo alpinae-Saxifragetum numidicae from the Djurjura mountainous region. New data referring to the chorology and floristic composition of the other previously described syntaxons are also provided. No disponible...|$|E
40|$|This study {{characterized}} the floristic composition of an inselberg in the Puxinanã municipality, of Paraíba, in Northeast Brazil. Ninety-seven species were recorded {{that belong to}} 35 families: Asteraceae (12 spp.), Euphorbiaceae and Fabaceae (nine spp. each), Rubiaceae and Convolvulaceae (eight spp. each) were the richest families, comprising 47. 42 % of the total species registered. The herbaceous habit was predominant, occurring in 39 % of the species, followed by species of shrubs (22 %), vines (20 %), <b>rupicolous</b> <b>plants</b> (6 %), subshrubs (5 %), trees (4 %) and epiphytes (1 %). Passiflora luetzelburgii Harms (Passifloraceae) is a new record for the flora of the state. The data from this study provides information {{that could be used}} in the conservation and rational use of the study area, and contributes to what is known about the flora and vegetation of the Caatinga...|$|R
