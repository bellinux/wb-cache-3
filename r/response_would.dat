5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This <b>response</b> <b>would</b> be much like that of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E
5|$|These words {{indicate}} that Tong Yabghu {{was eager to}} retain control of the westernmost portion of the Silk Route, as he tightened his grip of its other segments all the way east to China. In April 630 Böri Shad determined to expand his control of Transcaucasia and sent his general Chorpan Tarkhan with as little as 30,000 cavalry to invade Armenia. Using a characteristic ploy of nomadic warriors, Chorpan Tarkhan ambushed and annihilated a Persian force of 10,000 dispatched by Shahrbaraz to counter the invasion. Turks knew the Sassanid <b>response</b> <b>would</b> be harsh, they plundered cities and withdrew their forces back to the steppes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Vikes {{improved}} their lead with Longwell kicking a 38-yard field {{goal for the}} only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota pulled away with Taylor getting a 6-yard TD run. Oakland's only <b>response</b> <b>would</b> be Janikowski hitting a 52-yard field goal.|$|E

30|$|Day {{surgery is}} a common {{operative}} procedure for patients with breast cancer. In the United States and Europe, day surgery typically consists of partial resection of the breast (Bp) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB). However, in Japan, hospitalization surgery is still common for cases of breast cancer. Here, immune responses associated with the anesthetic technique used for day surgery versus hospitalization surgery for breast cancer patients were prospectively analyzed. It was hypothesized that immune <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> differ according to anesthetic technique, and these <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> influence patient outcome.|$|R
25|$|The {{response}} of the Ollie K. Wilds, commercial towboats, and the local Coast Guard units was commendable. Had the ferry not overturned so rapidly, their immediate <b>response</b> <b>would</b> have been instrumental in saving a number of lives. Unfortunately, the first rescuers were only able to find and rescue two survivors from the river; other survivors made their way onto the overturned hull.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, New York {{tried to come}} back as kicker Lawrence Tynes hit a 26-yard field goal. Minnesota {{answered}} with Longwell kicking a 26-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Vikings pulled away with safety Dwight Smith returning an interception 93 yards for a touchdown, along with LB Chad Greenway returning an interception 37 yards for a touchdown. The Giants' only <b>response</b> <b>would</b> be QB Eli Manning's 6-yard TD pass to WR Plaxico Burress.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} further {{constraints}} upon the sustaining of a Stackelberg equilibrium. The leader must know ex ante that the follower observes its action. The follower must have {{no means of}} committing to a future non-Stackelberg follower action and the leader must know this. Indeed, if the 'follower' could commit to a Stackelberg leader action and the 'leader' knew this, the leader's best <b>response</b> <b>would</b> be to play a Stackelberg follower action.|$|E

40|$|Using Tulving's (1985) remember/know procedure, {{the present}} {{research}} investigated the experiential concomitants of person recognition. Noting basic differences {{in the manner in}} which the mind processes expectancy-related material, it was anticipated that facial typicality would be a critical determinant of people's recollective experiences (i. e., remembering vs knowing). In particular, it was expected that whereas remember <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> be more prevalent for distinctive than typical faces, know <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> reflect the opposite pattern. The results of two experiments provided general support for these predictions. In addition, the recollective advantage for distinctive faces was traced to the availability of attentional resources at encoding. These results are considered in the context of contemporary issues in person recognition and social cognition...|$|R

25|$|By {{not asking}} about the horses, Confucius {{demonstrates}} that the sage values human beings over property; readers are led to reflect on whether their <b>response</b> <b>would</b> follow Confucius's and to pursue self-improvement if it would not have. Confucius, as an exemplar of human excellence, serves not as an all-powerful deity or a universally true set of abstract principles, but rather the ultimate model for others. For these reasons, according to many commentators, Confucius's teachings may be considered a Chinese example of humanism.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{net effect}} of the proinflammatory {{mediators}} is to kill infectious organisms and infected cells as well as to stimulate the production of molecules that amplify the mounting response to damage, it is also evident that in a nonregenerating organ such as the brain, a dysregulated innate immune <b>response</b> <b>would</b> be deleterious. In JE the tight regulation of microglial activation appears to be disturbed, resulting in an autotoxic loop of microglial activation that possibly leads to bystander neuronal damage. In animals, key signs include infertility and abortion in pigs, neurological disease in horses and systemic signs including fever, lethargy and anorexia.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} Anderson, {{who is no}} longer a {{prisoner}} and has been allowed to be present at the trial, objects, and the Diktatorat permits her to conduct Dredd's defence instead. She immediately calls Orlok as a witness and questions him about his own involvement in the Apocalypse War. Answering her questions truthfully, Orlok concedes that East-Meg One started the war by sending him to attack Mega-City One with the Block Mania virus, as well as launching the first missiles. He also accepts that, had a similar attack been launched against his own city, his <b>response</b> <b>would</b> have been similar to Dredd's.|$|E
50|$|The admiral's {{commands}} {{would be}} issued through his {{captain of the}} fleet, and the fleet's <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> be passed back to him. This role of intermediary between the overall commander and the commanded was analogous {{to that of a}} commander on a large warship, through whom orders were relayed to the crew and <b>responses</b> received. He <b>would</b> also act in some senses and instances as the admiral's chief of staff.|$|R
50|$|Subsequent {{studies on}} {{patients}} with prefrontal injuries {{have shown that}} the patients verbalized what the most appropriate social <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> be under certain circumstances.

30|$|The {{configuration}} of SNAT in “fw” {{as described above}} is necessary so that responses to outgoing connections to Internet originated in the internal and perimeter networks get back through “fw”.

25|$|In the prisoner's dilemma with {{third party}} punishment, {{two of the}} {{participants}} play a prisoner's dilemma, in which each must choose to either cooperate or defect. The game is set up such that {{regardless of what the}} other player does, it is rational for an income maxizer to always choose to defect, even though both players cooperating yields a higher payoff than both players defecting. A third player observes this exchange, then can pay to punish either player. An income maximizing third parties' rational <b>response</b> <b>would</b> be to not punish, and income maximizing players would choose to defect. A 2004 study demonstrates that a near majority of participants (46%) are willing to pay to punish if one participant defects. If both parties defect, 21% are still willing to punish.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Jules Roche, the Gleizes' had enough {{independent}} income and real estate to pursue their goals without bowing to material considerations, unlike many other artists. The Gleizes' spent {{more and more time}} at the family home in Serrières, in Cavalaire, and an even quieter location on the French Riviera, both associating with people more sympathetic to their social ideas. Gleizes became active in the Union Intellectuelle and lectured extensively in France, Germany, Poland and England, while continuing to write. In 1924–25 the Bauhaus (where certain ideals analogous to his own were practiced) requested a new book on Cubism (as part of a series which included Wassily Kandinsky's Point and Line to Plane, Paul Klee's Pedagogical Notebooks, and Kasimir Malevich's The Non-Objective World). Gleizes, in <b>response,</b> <b>would</b> write Kubismus (published in 1928) for the collection of Bauhausbücher 13, Munich. The publication of Kubismus in French the following year would bring Gleizes closer to Delaunay. In 1924 Gleizes, Léger and Amédée Ozenfant opened Académie Moderne.|$|E
25|$|On May 20, 1949, the SIRT {{announced}} that it intended to discontinue all of its passenger service, {{and that it would}} soon ask for permission from the PSC to do so, citing the loss of $1,061,716 in 1948. The PSC in <b>response</b> <b>would</b> rule that the railway must continue its operations, or that service be substituted by buses, or that the city take over the railway service as part of the municipal transit system. The SIRT made another request to discontinue its passenger service on June 3, 1952, with a date set of July 7. On June 16, the PSC ordered the SIRT to continue all of its passenger service pending a decision on the line's request to abandon its service. On July 9, hearings began concerning the proposed abandonment of the road. On July 16, in the hearings, the PSC counsel stated that the operating deficits that had been charged to the passenger service of the SIRT would disappear if they were included with the freight profits of the B in the New York area. After the hearings, the SIRT changed its planned abandonment date to September 12, 1952. The commissioner council said that a provision needed to be made for an additional two months of service, extending it to November 12, 1952.|$|E
30|$|Commission {{errors are}} {{interesting}} because TOT experiences sometimes occur {{when people are}} in a ‘blocked’ state, or when they have only partial information, such as the first letter. Such <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> have been classified as commission errors here. There were no effects of either Group or of Memory Load, nor was there an interaction between Group and Memory Load.|$|R
30|$|Prior {{to these}} {{scenarios}} being displayed, two brief video clips were played giving information in BSL about the overall survey {{and what was}} to be asked of the participants in each question. The videos also informed participants that all <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> be anonymous, that participation was optional, and that participants could leave the survey at any time and for any reason.|$|R
30|$|The {{students}} were explained {{that this was}} an independent study and that individual <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> remain confidential and would not be revealed to education officials, or members of staff at the school. The aim was to minimise the tendency to provide “correct” answers as opposed to true preferences. As mentioned earlier, the multidimensionality of the DCE framework also mitigates such strategic responses.|$|R
500|$|Shortly {{after her}} accession, Liliʻuokalani began to receive {{petitions}} to re-write the [...] "Bayonet Constitution" [...] through {{the two major}} political parties of the time, Hui Kālaiʻāina and the National Reform Party. With a vote of two-thirds of the registered voters, she moved to abrogate the existing 1887 constitution; however, when the Queen informed her cabinet of the plan, they withheld their support knowing what her opponents' likely <b>response</b> <b>would</b> be.|$|E
500|$|Though Flower {{was known}} for ruling with an [...] "iron paw", she was a devoted mother, affectionate with her family, and gentle with pups {{including}} her daughters'. When her young pups were lost in Zappa territory early in the third series, Flower risked a war with their neighbors to find them. Flower also accepted Axel, an abandoned pup from the rival Zappa group, into the Whiskers clan, where the usual <b>response</b> <b>would</b> have been to kill the young intruder. Flower's four-year reign ended late in the third series when she died after being bitten {{in the head by}} a Cape cobra while protecting a litter of newborn pups that were her own.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} George's reign, in 1936, {{the bronze}} penny, which had {{appeared}} light compared with older coppers when the alloy was first used for it in 1860, was regarded as weighty and cumbersome, the heaviest bronze coin in circulation in Europe. The weight when in bulk caused problems for business; the London Passenger Transport Board received 6,000 tonnes of pennies, halfpennies and farthings a year. A reduction of size for the penny was deemed impractical, given the time {{it would take to}} recoin the 3,000,000,000 pennies in circulation, and because many automatic machines that took pennies would have to be reconfigured. The major <b>response</b> <b>would</b> be the 1937 debut of the brass threepence coin. This twelve-sided piece was introduced [...] since threepence worth of pennies or halfpennies was heavy and inconvenient, and [...] the silver threepenny bit was deemed too small.|$|E
40|$|Abuse {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on the lead-acid batteries used to power electrical testers used at the Department of Energy's Pantex Plant. Batteries were subjected to short circuits, crushes, penetrations, and drops. None of the observed <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> {{be a threat to}} nuclear explosive safety in a bay or cell at Pantex. Temperatures, currents, and damage were measured and recorded during the tests...|$|R
50|$|NWAS was {{the first}} {{ambulance}} trust to be inspected by the Care Quality Commission, in August 2014. The Commission found the trust provided safe and effective services which were well-led and with a clear focus on quality but it was criticised for taking too many callers to hospital and for sending ambulances when other <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> have been more appropriate.|$|R
50|$|Self-punishment of <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> {{include the}} {{arranging}} of punishment contingent upon undesired responses. This {{might be seen}} in the behavior of whipping oneself which some monks and religious persons do. This is different from aversive stimulation in that, for example, the alarm clock generates escape from the alarm, while self-punishment presents stimulation after the fact to reduce the probability of future behavior.|$|R
500|$|Because of {{contrary}} {{winds and}} the difficulty in navigating the Saint Lawrence, the expedition took eight weeks to reach Quebec. The late arrival (wintry conditions were already setting in on the river) and the long voyage meant {{that it would be}} impossible to conduct a lengthy siege. Phips sent a message into the citadel demanding its surrender. Governor General Louis de Buade de Frontenac declared that his only <b>response</b> <b>would</b> be from [...] "the mouths of my cannons". Phips then held a war council, which decided to make a combined land assault and naval bombardment. Both failed. The landing force, 1,200 men led by Major John Walley, were unable to cross the well-defended Saint-Charles River, and the naval bombardment failed because the New Englanders' guns were unable to reach the high battlements of the city, and they furthermore soon ran out of ammunition. The fighting, according to Phips, cost the expedition 30 deaths and one field cannon, as well as numerous wounded; disease and disaster took an additional toll. Smallpox ravaged the troops, and two transports were lost to accidents; another 200 men were lost to these causes.|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} the Brazilian Cabinet could not reach {{agreement}} {{as to how to}} address the danger posed by Rosas. Some ministers advocated seeking a peaceful resolution at any cost. These feared Brazil was unprepared for war and that a defeat would lead to a situation similar to the chaos following the loss of Cisplatine in the 1820s, which ended in abdication by Dom Pedro I, the Emperor's father. Other ministers took the position that only a military <b>response</b> <b>would</b> eliminate the threat. In 1849, however, Paulino José Soares de Sousa, a member of the pro-war faction and later Viscount of Uruguai, was chosen as the new minister of Foreign Affairs. Soares made clear his intent to deal with Argentina without foreign assistance, announcing that the [...] "Imperial Government does not desire or judge convenient an alliance with France or any other European nation related to the matters in the Platine region. It understands that they must be resolved by the nations which [...] are closely connected with... It will not admit European influence over America." [...] The Empire of Brazil was determined to extend its zone of influence over South America.|$|E
500|$|The Jeopardy! round {{begins when}} the {{returning}} champion selects a clue, {{which may be}} from any position on the game board. The clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a hand-held signaling device. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide {{a response to the}} clue, phrased {{in the form of a}} question. For example, if a contestant were to select [...] "Presidents for $200", the resulting clue could be [...] "This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree", to which the correct <b>response</b> <b>would</b> be [...] "Who is/was George Washington?" [...] (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of [...] "who is/are" [...] for people or [...] "what is/are" [...] for things or words is almost always used.) If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring-in and respond. If no contestant both rings-in and responds correctly, the host gives the correct response; the [...] "last correct questioner" [...] chooses the next clue.|$|E
40|$|During {{medical school}} {{students}} must learn and retain a {{large volume of}} information that is important for success in their future career as physicians. Laboratory studies have given insight into the mechanisms underpinning learning and memory, but {{few studies have examined}} the time course of memorial retention in a real world setting. The current study aimed to examine the memorial mechanisms used to retain information over time by using a variation of the Remember/Know/New recognition memory procedure to examine memory retention for anatomical information in first year medical students. Participants were presented with anatomical terms and asked to respond whether they Can Define the term, were Familiar with the term or Don’t Know the term. Participants’ Remember and Know responses are thought to be reflective of different processes, recollection and familiarity, respectively. We were particularly interested in examining differences in memorial retention based on retention interval (immediately at course end and after six months). All participants were enrolled in a Medical Gross Anatomy course. The course was divided into three successive modules, each of which culminated in an examination, module 1 : Back and Limbs, module 2 : Thorax, Abdomen and Pelvis, and module 3 : Head and Neck. Participants completed a computer based memory task at three separate time points: prior to course start (session 1), after course completion (session 2); and six months after course completion (session 3). Students were presented with anatomical terms from each module and asked to respond whether they Can Define, are Familiar with or Don’t Know a term. We predicted that <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> differ depending on when the module of the course was taught and when the testing occurred. Following work on primacy and recency, we predicted that at session 2 students would make the most Can Define responses to information learned most recently. We predicted that the second most Can Define <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> be to information learned the longest period of time from the testing session, and that information learned in the middle would be least well recalled (lowest number of Can Define responses). Furthermore, we predicted that familiarity <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> show the reverse pattern to Can Define responses at session 2. We also predicted that performance would differ by session. We hypothesized that the proportion of Can Define <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> be higher for session 2 relative to session 3, due to the processes of forgetting. Furthermore, we predicted that recollective processes characterized by Can Define <b>responses,</b> <b>would</b> be most common in module 3, the module most recently studied relative to session 2. Lastly, we predicted that the number of Familiar <b>responses</b> <b>would</b> increase across the two sessions. Our results showed that responses varied based on when the information was taught in that participants made more Can Define responses to recently learned module 3 and earliest learned module 1 relative to module 2. Responses also varied by session, as the number of Familiar responses increased overall across session 2 and 3. At session 3, {{there were no significant differences}} in the proportion of Can Define or Familiar responses between the different modules of the course. Theoretically, these results suggest that while the order of teaching impacts performance at course end, in the longer-term order of teaching ceases to matter and level of forgetting plateaus across modules. Practically however, a teacher’s aim is to maximize retention. Students might benefit from interleaving of course content instead of separate blocks, so that no one module is taught in the middle and more frequent testing to boost overall retention...|$|R
