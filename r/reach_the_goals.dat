Greenpeace also claims that Coca-Cola has actively lobbied against recycling and deposit return schemes in several European countries, {{while at the same}} time maintaining a green marketing facade with vague promises and false-solutions such as sizable donations to schemes that put the emphasis of anti-littering on the consumer, instead of the producer of the litter itself.|$|E
