50|$|Among {{those to}} testify {{on behalf of}} the {{prosecution}} was Inspector Colin Campbell, who testified as to the prints on the Winchester bottle being a precise match for the samples Griffiths had twice provided for investigators, and which he readily acknowledged were his own. To demonstrate this, enlarged copies of both sets of fingerprints were displayed to the jury, with Inspector Campbell indicating 16 <b>ridge</b> <b>characteristics</b> which were in agreement on both sets of impressions. Inspector Campbell also testified as to the stockinged feet impressions Griffiths had provided for investigators also being remarkably similar in characteristics with those found upon the ward from which June Anne had been abducted. Also to testify {{on behalf of the}} prosecution were individuals who described how the suit Griffiths had pawned shortly after the murder was heavily bloodstained in several locations on both the jacket and trousers, and that the bloodstains were of the same blood type of June Anne Devaney, and that fibres from this suit were of a perfect match to fibres found upon the child's clothing, body, and the window ledge where her murderer had evidently entered the hospital. None of these experts were cross-examined by Griffiths' defence counsel.|$|E

40|$|Wind erosion in {{agricultural}} soils is dependent, in part, on the aerodynamic roughness length (z 0 ) produced by tillage ridges. Although {{previous studies have}} related z 0 to <b>ridge</b> <b>characteristics</b> (ridge height (RH) and spacing (RS)), these relationships have not been tested for tillage ridges observed in the North African agricultural fields. In these regions, due to climate and soil conditions, small plowing tools are largely used. Most of these tools produce non-aggregated and closely-spaced small ridges. Thus, experiments were conducted in a 7 -m long wind tunnel to measure z 0 for 11 ridge types covering the range of geometric characteristics frequently observed in south Tunisia. Experimental results suggest that RH 2 /RS is the first order parameter controlling z 0 . A strong relationship between z 0 and RH 2 /RS is proposed {{for a wide range}} of <b>ridge</b> <b>characteristics...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{objective}} of image enhancement technique {{is to improve}} the overall performance by optimally arranging input images for afterward processing stages. A fingerprint is the pattern of ridges and valleys on the surface of a fingertip. Each person has unique fingerprints. The uniqueness of a fingerprint is exclusively determined by the local <b>ridge</b> <b>characteristics</b> and their relationships. 150 different local ridge distinctiveness like islands, short ridges, enclosure, etc. have been acknowledged. These local ridge distinctiveness are not evenly distributed. Most of them heavily depends on the impression conditions, quality of fingerprints and are not often observed in fingerprints. The two most prominent local <b>ridge</b> <b>characteristics,</b> called minutiae, are ridge ending and ridge bifurcation. A ridge ending can be defined as the point where a ridge ends sharply. A ridge bifurcation is defined as the point where a ridge forks or diverges into branch ridges. A good quality fingerprint characteristically contain...|$|E

30|$|Gender {{determination}} with Adobe Photoshop CS 5 provides enormous {{possibilities of}} better working environment {{as compared to}} the conventional method (Plato et al. 1975). Besides this, present study supported the hypothesis of lesser ridge density in males as well as highlights the importance of <b>ridge</b> <b>characteristics</b> to conclude gender differences. Cummins and Midlo (1943) have established that females do have higher mean ridge count (23.4) than males (20.7). Okajima (1970) also found that fork index is higher in females than in male in fingerprints. This again upholds the trend as in this present study. But certain authors also reported negative results regarding this hypothesis, According to Reddy (1975), the mean ridge count for males is 13.41 and that of female are 12.04. These figures were exactly the opposite of Acree (1999). A similar study has been undertaken on males and females belonging to American Negroes and Caucasian American by Plato et al. (1975). Here again they found that the mean ridge density in male is more than female. But in the present study, results synchronized with researchers who concluded lesser ridge density of males as compared to females. Further, pattern and <b>ridge</b> <b>characteristics</b> has also correlation with gender differences were also studied, which suggested that irrespective of finger, the frequency of ulnar loop was found to be perceptibly higher in males than in females. Similarly, frequency of radial loop was more in females than in males. The irrespective of fingers and gender, ridge endings and enclosures were found to be the most common minutiae characteristics present in the fingerprints and found more frequently in males as compared to females.|$|E

40|$|Fingerprint {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} and traditional biometric trait and its uniqueness are exclusively determined by the local <b>ridge</b> <b>characteristics</b> and their relationships.

To overcome this problem, more number of different fingerprint classifiers are considered. This paper proposes a new effective methodology using minutiae matching technique along with singularities detection and indexing, based on the occurrences of singular points with reference to the core point. From the results, it shows this technique is effective and it is measured in terms of False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) ...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{has been made}} of the salient features of 112 first-year and 64 multi-year sea ice ridges. Based on this information, the important characteristics of the ridges have been related through simple equations. In particular, the ratio of the keel-depth to sail-height was found to be 4. 4 for first-year ridges, and 3. 3 for multi-year ridges; the ratio of the keel-area to sail-area was 8. 0 for first-year ridges and 8. 8 for multi-year ridges. Also, for first-year ridges, the ratio of the keel-width to sail-height was approximately 15, and the ratio of the keel-width to keel-depth was 3. 9. An analysis of the sail and keel angles indicates a distribution of values with an average sail angle of 21 for temperate ridges, and 33 for ridges in the Beaufort Sea.

40|$|Continual {{reports of}} illicit {{trafficking}} incidents involving radioactive materials have prompted authorities {{to consider the}} likelihood of forensic evidence being exposed to radiation.

Fingermarks deposited on common surfaces, including aluminum, glass, office paper, and plastic, were exposed to doses ranging from 1 to 1000 kGy, in an effort to simulate realistic situations where evidence is exposed to significant doses of radiation from sources used in a criminal act. The fingermarks were processed using routine fingermark detection techniques.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of sand ridges, as observed on the innershelves and midshelves of various coastal seas, are investigated {{within the framework}} of an idealized model. These seabed undulations include shoreface-connected sand ridges and tidal sand banks. The new aspects in this study are the explicit incorporation of both steady and tidal currents, a shelf with a sloping bottom, and a statistical approach to describe the sediment transport during storms (linear in the current) and fair weather conditions (cubic in the current). The present model is used to gain understanding of the different <b>ridge</b> <b>characteristics</b> in different geographical regions. This is done by analyzing the initial growth of small bottom perturbations, which evolve on a basic state describing a longshore uniform flow over a reference topography. It is found that basically five different bottom modes can be excited: shoreface-connected sand ridges, Coriolis ridges, friction-induced bars, trapped tidal ridges, and tidal sand banks. Their growth, which is due to different physical mechanisms, strongly depends on the weather climate and the geometrical characteristics of the shelf. Postprint (published version...|$|E
