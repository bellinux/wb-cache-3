25|$|By 1820 a {{large part}} of the area had been subsumed by Joseph Underwood's large 'Ashfield Park Estate'. This {{property}} remained largely intact for more than 40 years, until it was subdivided into large blocks after the death of Elizabeth Underwood in 1858. By this time its proximity to the railway made it a desirable area (the station was originally called Fivedock). One of these subdivisions was the 'Highbury Estate', on part of which Anthony Hordern, son of the founder of the great <b>retail</b> <b>firm,</b> Anthony Hordern & Sons, eventually built his house 'Shubra Hall', just beyond the west border of Ashfield. It later became part of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, the current boundaries of which give an idea of the extent of the Hordern property. The College, including Shubra Hall, the main school building and the Meta Street entrance gates, is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.|$|E

Typically if the online <b>retail</b> <b>firm</b> has no nexus (also known as substantial physical presence) in the state where the merchandise will be delivered, no obligation is imposed upon the retailer to collect sales taxes from [...] "out-of-state" [...] purchasers. Generally, state law requires that the purchaser report such purchases to the state taxing authority and pay the use tax, which compensates for the sales tax that is not paid by the retailer.|$|E

In view of the prominent role that the retail industry plays in the South African economy, {{the purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effect of working capital management on the profitability of South African <b>retail</b> <b>firms.</b> Eighteen <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> that were listed on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange for a period of nine years (2004 - 2012) were analysed.

40|$|Less {{than twenty}} years ago there was a {{clear-cut}} borderline between retailing and banking, but after the deregulation of the financial markets this line is not as evident and definite any longer. In combination with far-reaching innovations and advancements {{within the field of}} information technology the deregulation has {{paved the way for the}} development and launching of new banking formats. This has been apprehended by <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> that wish to provide financial services as a supplement to their regular assortment of goods – an interest that is growing among <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> in general and among large grocery <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> in particular. Consequently, the traditional boundary between the two industries has gradually changed and to some extent been dissolved. That this is especially true for the distinction between grocery retailing and retail banking is accentuated and clearly demonstrated in many countries by the entrance of large domestic grocery <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> into <b>retail</b> financial services. In many cases the retailer accomplishes the provision of financial services by co-operating with an established bank in the form of a strategic alliance, but there are also recent examples of retailers starting a bank of their own.

The population was the list of ready to wear <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> in Istanbul, given by the Turkish Council of Shopping Centers and <b>Retail</b> <b>firms.</b> Out of 81 <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> on the list, 50 were contacted.

Findings suggested important conclusions about the state of database marketing among ready-to-wear <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> in Turkey. Database marketing was in its introductory state. There were only a few applicators, who did not apply database marketing in the full sense. Most of the retailers thought that they knew their customers, so did not need to collect customer information. Even if they did collect it, they did not analyze it, or gave meaning to it. Customer information did not shape their marketing strategies or actions. Some retailers that collected customer information used it for direct mail purposes.

40|$|While {{previous}} research has advocated the use of online sales channels as a driver for international expansion, {{the nature of the}} relationship between e-commerce and international sales is still unexplored.

The effect is, however, negatively moderated by geographical export scope. The study contributes to research focusing on e-commerce in internationalizing <b>retailing</b> <b>firms</b> by specifically demonstrating that strategic considerations related to the geographical scope of operations are likely to have significant effects on their international sales performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{financial}} performance of <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> with fiscal years ending on or around December 31, 2008 and 2009 (the recession years) with <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> with fiscal years ending on or around December 31, 2006 and 2007 (the non-recession years). As with Little, Little, and Coffee (2008), the modified Du Pont model of financial ratio analysis is used to identify the drivers of financial success under alternative business strategies. <b>Firms</b> in the <b>retail</b> industry are categorized according to their high/low relative net operating income to sales and operating asset turnover ratios. Firms with high relative net operating income to sales and low relative operating asset turnover are assumed to be pursuing a differentiation strategy and those with high relative operating asset turnover and low relative net operating income to sales are assumed to be pursuing a cost leadership strategy. The performance variable used is return on net operating assets. One stream of prior research suggests that a firm could, in theory, perform well following either strategy. Little, Little, and Coffee (2008) suggest that <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> using a differentiator strategy outperform (based on return on net operating assets) those using a cost leader strategy. However, the findings of this research suggest that <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> pursuing a differentiation strategy are not more likely to achieve a higher return on net operating assets than those firms pursuing a cost leadership strategy in a recessionary period...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the factors that motivate {{international}} retail companies to choose franchising as a method for entering international markets. Employs a qualitative methodology and a multiple case study design. Six major UK-based international fashion retailers form the empirical basis for the work. Finds the motivating influences to be a combination of both organisational and environmental factors. International retailing experience, availability of financial resources, presence of a franchisable retail brand, company restructuring and influence of key managers emerge as the organisational factors while environmental influences are revealed as opportunistic approaches, local market complexities, domestic competitive pressures and availability of potential franchise partners. Provides a useful source of information for those <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> considering internationalization via the franchising method. Research is made all the more pertinent by the fact that <b>retail</b> service <b>firms</b> do not necessarily have franchising experience in the domestic market before they adopt franchising in the international environment. While findings are particular to <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> they could also have relevance for other service sectors. Addresses a gap in international franchising literature by examining the factors that motivate <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> to internationalise via franchising. As such, the paper contributes to academic and practitioner understanding of the international retail franchise process...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine pricing {{behaviour}} of <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> in the Netherlands during 1998 - 2003 using a large database with monthly price quotes of 49 articles, representing different product types.

A multivariate analysis shows that firm size matters with prices being stickiest in small firms and most flexible in large <b>firms</b> and in <b>retail</b> <b>firms</b> consisting of the owners only. Furthermore, we investigate pass-through effects of VAT changes in prices. We find that VAT increases are almost completely passed on to consumers.
