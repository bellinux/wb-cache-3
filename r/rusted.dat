The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue, temporarily removing the rays from the statue's halo so their <b>rusted</b> supports could be replaced. <b>Rusted</b> cast-iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete; the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced, as well. Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal. The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Leaf <b>rust,</b> stem <b>rust,</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> {{are among}} the most {{important}} diseases of wheat and barley worldwide and are best controlled using genetic resistance. To increase the diversity of <b>rust</b> resistance in wheat and barley, a project was initiated to identify and characterise <b>rust</b> resistance genes from the wild species of Aegilops sharonensis (Sharon goatgrass) and Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum (wild barley), respectively. One hundred and two accessions of Sharon goatgrass from Israel and 318 Wild Barley Diversity Collection (WBDC) accessions from the Fertile Crescent, Central Asia, North Africa, and the Caucasus region were evaluated for resistance to leaf <b>rust,</b> stem <b>rust,</b> and/or stripe <b>rust.</b> Sharon goatgrass exhibited a wide range of infection types (ITs) in response to leaf <b>rust,</b> stem <b>rust,</b> and stripe <b>rust.</b> The percentage of resistant accessions in Sharon goatgrass was 58. 8 – 78. 4 % for leaf <b>rust,</b> 11. 8 – 69. 6 % for stem <b>rust,</b> and 46. 1 % for stripe <b>rust,</b> depending on the race used and the plant growth stage. Genetic studies with Sharon goatgrass revealed oligogenic resistance to leaf <b>rust</b> and stem <b>rust.</b> Wild barley also exhibited a wide range of ITs to leaf <b>rust</b> and stem rust; however, the overall frequency of resistance was lower than for Sharon goatgrass. The percentage of resistant accessions in wild barley was 25. 8 % for leaf <b>rust</b> and 5. 7 – 20. 1 % for stem <b>rust,</b> depending on the race used. Resistance to the new virulent stem <b>rust</b> race TTKS (i. e. Ug 99), present in eastern Africa, was found in both Sharon goatgrass (70 % of accessions) and wild barley (25 % of 20 accessions tested).

5|$|A year later, in September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire. The two battleships and the ancient central battery ironclad —which had {{been built in the}} mid-1870s—had been on a summer training cruise since July, and so were prepared for the conflict. On 1 October, shortly after the outbreak of war, Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet was moored at Beirut. The following day, the fleet departed for Constantinople for repairs in preparation to engage the Italian fleet. Nevertheless, the bulk of the Ottoman fleet, including Barbaros Hayreddin, remained in port for the duration of the war. By the end of the war, Barbaros Hayreddin and her sister were in very poor condition. Their rangefinders and the ammunition hoists for their main battery guns had been removed, their telephones did not work, and the pipes for their pumps were badly <b>rusted.</b> Most of the watertight doors could not close, and the condensers remained problematic.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{moved to}} Atlanta, Georgia {{for the final}} phase.

The design team removed walls, hauled out old railway cars, suspended <b>rusted</b> car parts and auto-plant car rails, and constructed smaller buildings within the main building to transform the site. With twenty-five pages of script to shoot in a limited time, cinematographer Stephen Windon and his team spent three weeks setting up a series of high-powered, motorized lights in the rafters of the building, that could be controlled remotely to allow lighting to be altered quickly while fully illuminating the set. An exterior scene involving Diesel and Walker attending a car party, involving several high-performance cars, was filmed near the Georgia Dome. The train heist scene was filmed in Rice, California over three weeks.|$|E

40|$|Leaf <b>rust</b> {{caused by}} Puccinia triticina {{is the most}} common and widely {{distributed}} of the three wheat <b>rusts.</b> Losses from leaf <b>rust</b> are usually less damaging than those from stem <b>rust</b> and stripe <b>rust,</b> but leaf <b>rust</b> causes greater annual losses due to its more frequent and widespread occurrence.

5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables <b>rusted,</b> and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E

5|$|The bones {{found on}} 25 August were {{uncovered}} on 4 September and the grave soil dug back further {{over the next}} two days. The feet were missing, and the skull was found in an unusual propped-up position, consistent with the body being put into a grave that was slightly too small. The spine was curved in an S-shape. No sign of a coffin was found; the skeleton's posture suggested the body had not been put in a shroud, but had been hurriedly dumped into the grave and buried. As the bones were lifted from the ground, a piece of <b>rusted</b> iron was found underneath the vertebrae. The skeleton's hands were in an unusual position, crossed over the right hip, suggesting they were tied together at the time of burial, although this could not be established definitively.

5|$|The depots and airbases {{depended}} on an efficient road network, so the engineers gave this a high priority. A major {{effort was made}} to bring the roads up to all-weather standard before onset of the 1942 wet season. New roads were also built. One of the first was the By Pass Road, which was designed to divert traffic from the main road, which ran around the south eastern end of Jackson Drome, and was therefore an operational hazard. The By Pass Road ran between Jackson and Wards Dromes, and was later extended to Berry, Schwimmer and Durand Dromes. The opening of the new wharf at Tatana Island in October caused a sudden jump in road traffic, so a new Barune Road was opened in November that provided a loop to Jackson and Wards Dromes. Fortunately, the local red shale contained clay and rock fragments, and when laid on a prepared subgrade and watered, either by sprinklers or rain, became hard like concrete. This could take motor vehicle traffic, although it became dusty when dry and slippery when wet. Surfacing material was obtained from the Nine Mile Quarry. Wood was found to be unsuitable for culverts, as it was quickly destroyed by the action of climate and insects. Oil drums were found to be superior, but they <b>rusted,</b> and using them for culverts depleted the drum supply.|$|E

40|$|Key message We {{detected}} several, {{most likely}} novel QTL for adult plant resistance to <b>rusts.</b> Notably three QTL improved resistance to leaf <b>rust</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> simultaneously indicating broad spectrum resistance QTL. Abstract The <b>rusts</b> of wheat (Puccinia spp.) are destructive fungal wheat diseases. The deployment of resistant cultivars plays {{a central role}} in integrated <b>rust</b> disease management. Durability of resistance would be preferred, but is difficult to analyse. The Austrian winter wheat cultivar Capo was released in the 1989 and grown on a large acreage during more than two decades and maintained a good level of quantitative leaf <b>rust</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> resistance. Two bi-parental mapping populations: Capo × Arina and Capo × Furore were tested in multiple environments for severity of leaf <b>rust</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> at the adult plant stage in replicated field experiments. Quantitative trait loci associated with leaf <b>rust</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> severity were mapped using DArT and SSR markers. Five QTL were detected in multiple environments associated with resistance to leaf <b>rust</b> designated as QLr. ifa- 2 AL, QLr. ifa- 2 BL, QLr. ifa- 2 BS, QLr. ifa- 3 BS, and QLr. ifa- 5 BL, and five for resistance to stripe <b>rust</b> QYr. ifa- 2 AL, QYr. ifa- 2 BL, QYr. ifa- 3 AS, QYr. ifa- 3 BS, and QYr. ifa- 5 A. For all QTL apart from two (QYr. ifa- 3 AS, QLr. ifa- 5 BL) Capo contributed the resistance improving allele. The leaf <b>rust</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> resistance QTL on 2 AL, 2 BL and 3 BS mapped to the same chromosome positions, indicating either closely linked genes or pleiotropic gene action. These three multiple disease resistance QTL (QLr. ifa- 2 AL/QYr. ifa- 2 AL, QLr. ifa. 2 BL/QYr. ifa- 2 BL, QLr. ifa- 3 BS/QYr. ifa. 3 BS) potentially contribute novel resistance sources for stripe <b>rust</b> and leaf <b>rust.</b> The long-lasting resistance of Capo apparently rests upon a combination of several genes.
