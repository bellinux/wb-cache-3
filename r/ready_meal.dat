40|$|<b>Ready</b> <b>meals</b> {{are fully}} cooked {{and ready to}} eat with a shelf life that ranges from few months to 3 years. They {{are one of the}} fastest growing areas of the food market in both {{developed}} and developing countries. A demand of <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> is growing continuously everywhere including U. K. Especially the popularity of Indian dishes, chicken tikka masala etc. provides most of the inspiration for the <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> that form the bulk of the retail market, as well as for cooking sauces. Though the demand for the <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> is increasing in the global market, the supply is still not satisfactory. For example, there are more than 500 units in London, which are into <b>ready</b> <b>meals.</b> This shows that exports as well as the domestic market offer a vast scope for the Indian producers to excel in this sector. The Indian meal sector in U. K. is being challenged by other cuisines, which will probably show faster growth. Therefore, Indian suppliers will have to meet the needs and demands of various types of consumer, by providing some with new dishes and to others with the familiar preferred <b>ready</b> <b>meals.</b> The ethnic food market also continues to grow in U. K. as consumers demand more diverse flavors as a result of travel and the abundance of ethnic restaurants. To quote an example: Waitrose collaborated with renowned London Indian restaurant Quilon to launch a new range of <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> to compete with Sainsbury's Bombay Brasserie range. Thus, as there is a great potential for the packaged <b>ready</b> <b>meals,</b> the main relevance of conducting this research is to study the changing U. K. consumers' attitude and behavior towards <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> and measure the growth opportunities by evaluating the various factors leading to their growth. The research will be helpful in understanding the consumers' preferences and perceptions with regard to <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> as home meal replacement. The result of the study will also provide the companies dealing in <b>Ready</b> <b>meals</b> as to what consumers actually want and what changes suggested by consumers, if adopted seriously, can help in gaining a competitive edge on its competitors. Through this research it is possible to know whether <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> is actually a convenient substitute to home fresh cooked meals or the manufactures are producing it for the profit motive and ignoring the health of their consumers. 	The study indicates that the strategy of the marketer in <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> is to inform and educate consumers regarding the absence of preservatives in their food, price reduction keeping quality intact and increasing variety of <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> along with increasing the quantity for different cuisines...|$|R

Micronutrient deficiencies contribute to many age-related disorders. One group at particular risk of micronutrient deficiencies is the elderly. Many elderly, such as the frail and those living in institutions, rely on <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> of variable, often poor, nutritional quality for a significant part of their daily nutritional needs. New policies are needed to ensure that micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) and phytochemicals of known nutritional value are retained during the manufacture of <b>ready</b> <b>meals.</b> This together with increased awareness of the importance of micronutrients for health, and simple, clear labelling of the micronutrient content of <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> would help in the choice of healthier products. Professionally prepared <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> monitored by nutritionists and dietitians can help achieve these goals so that <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> become part of the solution to poor nutrition in the elderly, rather than being viewed as part of the problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective The ready-meal {{market has}} grown {{considerably}} in recent years. At the same time, a degradation of traditional cooking skills has been observed. <b>Ready</b> <b>meals</b> are often rich in energy, fat and sugar and lack vegetables; however, studies investigating associations between ready-meal consumption, overweight and cooking skills are lacking. The present study examines whether demographic factors, overweight, {{beliefs about the}} nutritional value and taste of <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> and cooking skills are associated with ready-meal consumption. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Ready-meal consumption, weight status, cooking skills, beliefs about the taste and nutritional value of <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> and demographic variables were assessed with self-administered questionnaires. Data were analysed with one-way ANOVA and multiple regression analysis. Subjects A total of 1017 adults from the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Results Men reported being more positive about <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> and having fewer cooking skills compared with women. Overweight adults (BMI > 25 kg/m 2) were more positive about nutrients and vitamins in <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> compared with normal-weight adults. Ready-meal consumption was associated with cooking skills (β = − 0 · 192), age (β =− 0 · 228), overweight (β = 0 · 129), nutritional value (β = − 0 · 131), taste (β = − 0 · 126), working status (β = 0 · 096) and gender (β = 0 · 084). Conclusions Cooking skills were identified as a strong predictor of ready-meal consumption. The importance of cooking skills {{as a barrier to}} healthy eating should be explored, as it is plausible that cooking skills will further decrease in the future. Next, the study provided evidence for an association between ready-meal consumption and overweight. Further research should examine the importance of <b>ready</b> <b>meals</b> for the overweight epidemi...|$|R

50|$|Recipes {{intended}} for other cooking methods must be modified for slow cookers. Quantities of liquids may need adjustment, {{as there is}} a little evaporation, but there should be enough liquid to cover the food. Many published recipes for slow cookers are designed primarily for convenience and use few ingredients, and often use prepared sauces or seasonings. The long, moist cooking is particularly suitable for tough and cheap cuts of meat including pork shoulder, beef chuck and brisket. For many slow-cooked dishes, these cuts give better results than more expensive ones. They are also often used to cook while no one is there to care for it, meaning the cook can fill the pot with its ingredients and come back several hours later to a <b>ready</b> <b>meal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On 7 February 2013, Findus {{announced}} {{that in a}} sample of 18 beef lasagne products that it tested, 11 contained between 60% and 100% horse meat. It was also revealed that some of the products sold had minced meat declared as beef that was 60-100% horse meat. The source of the horse meat was third party supplier Comigel, a French-headquartered frozen <b>ready</b> <b>meal</b> producer, from its subsidiary Tavola factory in Capellen, Luxembourg. According to the FSA the company had been alerted by a third-party French supplier on 4 February 2013, and tested its beef lasagne products finding over 50% of the tested products contained horse meat. According to reports both Findus UK and the French supplier withdrew all products related to the third party supplier. The reason for the adulteration was initially stated as [...] "highly likely" [...] criminal activity.|$|E
5000|$|According to folklore, {{his real}} name was Andrew Christie, a Perth butcher. During a severe famine in the mid-fourteenth century (Hector Boece records floods, morrain, and plagues of [...] "myce and ratonis" [...] {{throughout}} Scotland in 1340), Christie joined a group of scavengers {{in the foothills of}} the Grampians. When one of the party died of starvation, Christie put his skills to work on the corpse and provided his companions with a <b>ready</b> <b>meal.</b> The group developed a taste for human flesh as, under Christie's leadership, they began to ambush travellers in the passes of the Grampians, feeding on their bodies and those of their horses. It is alleged that before attacking, Christie would haul his victims from their mounts with a hook on a rod: this implement was the [...] "cleke" [...] (i.e., [...] "crook") from which he took his sobriquet. Thirty riders apparently died at Christie's hands. Eventually the company was defeated by an armed force from Perth, except for Christie himself, who supposedly escaped and re-entered society under a new name.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aims: To {{investigate}} whether a daily intake of a nutrient-balanced <b>ready</b> <b>meal</b> containing 4 g of oat beta-glucans lowers total cholesterol (T-C) and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in hyperlipidemic subjects and to evaluate {{its effect on}} postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations. Methods: A parallel, placebo-controlled trial {{was carried out in}} 43 healthy men and women with elevated serum cholesterol levels. During the 3 -week run-in period, all subjects consumed daily a ready-meal soup, low in energy and fat and high in fiber but without oat beta-glucans. Subjects were then randomly assigned for the following 5 -week intervention period to either continue consumption of the control soup or an equal soup supplemented with beta-glucan. Results: Consumption of the beta-glucan-enriched <b>ready</b> <b>meal</b> decreased T-C (0. 22 +/- 0. 41 mmol/l) and LDL-C (0. 16 +/- 0. 36 mmol/l), but the reductions were not significantly lower compared with control. After a meal with beta-glucan soup, neither postprandial glucose nor insulin concentrations were significantly different from those after a control soup. Conclusion: A daily dose of 4 g of oat beta-glucans incorporated into a healthy <b>ready</b> <b>meal</b> did not significantly lower T-C and LDL-C compared with an equal <b>ready</b> <b>meal</b> without beta-glucans. Thus, if a food product fulfils general healthy dietary recommendations it may not necessarily be a candidate for supplementation with beta-glucans. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E
