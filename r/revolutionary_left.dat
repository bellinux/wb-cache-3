25|$|On Gustav Landauer's death {{during the}} Munich Soviet Republic uprising, Rocker {{took over the}} work of editing the German {{publications}} of Kropotkin's writings. In 1920, the social democratic Defense Minister Gustav Noske started {{the suppression of the}} <b>revolutionary</b> <b>left,</b> which led to the imprisonment of Rocker and Fritz Kater. During their mutual detainment, Rocker convinced Kater, who had still held some social democratic ideals, completely of anarchism.|$|E

Banzer won a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, followed by former President Paz Estenssoro's MNR and former Vice President Jaime Paz Zamora's <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Left</b> Movement (MIR). In the congressional run-off, the MIR sided with MNR, and Paz Estenssoro was chosen for a fourth term as President. When he took office in 1985, he faced a staggering economic crisis. Economic output and exports had been declining for several years.|$|E

25|$|Perón himself {{returned}} to Argentina on June 20, {{three weeks after}} Cámpora's inaugural. Rucci, Miguel and other syndicalist figures organized the tribune from which Perón was to address {{the hundreds of thousands}} of supporters gathered near Ezeiza Airport. Hours before the scheduled landing, snipers following orders from López Rega shot at leftists in the crowd from the tribune. The ensuing Ezeiza Massacre irreparably split Peronists between the <b>revolutionary</b> <b>left</b> wing and the right wing. The latter's benefactor, López Rega, would increasingly wield influence through Perón's neophyte wife, Isabel.|$|E
25|$|By 1883 the {{membership}} of the SLP had fallen to an estimated 1500 members in just 30 Sections, a depressing atrophy which had led to the abandonment of the organization in April of that year even by its nominal head, Corresponding Secretary Philip Van Patten. Two individuals filled the role on a temporary basis {{for the rest of the}} year, culminating in the party's 4th National Convention in December 1883. There the 16 delegates, in an effort to forge links with non-party revolutionary socialists in an effort to keep them out of the camp of the rival anarchist movement, decided to steer the organization on a leftward course, curtaining the authority of the governing National Executive Committee and abolishing the centralizing post of Corresponding Secretary altogether in an effort to render the SLP a more decentralized organization amenable to the <b>revolutionary</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E
25|$|Banzer opposed bitterly the UDP {{government}} of Siles which lasted from 1982 to 1985, but turned more conciliatory when Víctor Paz Estenssoro {{was elected president}} (by congress, due to the virtual inattainability of the 50% necessary for direct election) in 1985. Indeed, Banzer's party claimed authorship {{of some of the}} most important neoliberal economic reforms instituted by Paz to curb galloping hyperinflation, repress the ever-troublesome labor unions, and reduce the size of the government. Banzer finished second in the 1989 elections, but supported in Congress the third-place finisher, the allegedly left-leaning Jaime Paz, who became President with ADN help, in return for Paz's promise to support him in a future election. The former dictator again finished second in 1993, this time to the MNR's Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada. The MNRs plurality, in coalition with the small center-left Bolivia Libre party, made it possible to confirm the MNR's electoral victory. In the 1997 elections, however, Banzer finished first by a small plurality, and was able to take the presidency with the support of Paz and others in a grand coalition ranging from Paz' <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Left</b> Movement to Banzer's ADN on the right.|$|E

25|$|In the Estates-General he {{supported}} a constitutional monarchy and aligned {{himself with the}} Girondins. His liberal reformist political position enabled him to be made {{the commander of the}} national guard in the Évreux district in 1790. He stopped attending the National Constituent Assembly after its first session and was not re-elected in 1792. After the Jacobins outlawed the Girondins in 1793, Puisaye became a counter-revolutionary, but his earlier association with the <b>revolutionaries</b> <b>left</b> him untrusted among more conservative counter-revolutionaries.|$|R
25|$|In 1976 {{there had}} been plans to send great part of the Uruguayan MLN Tupamaros, the Chilean Movement of the <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Left</b> (MIR) and the Bolivian Revolutionary Army (ELN) to fight {{alongside}} the ERP and Montoneros in Argentina, but the plans failed to materialize due to the military coup. Furthermore, by 1976 Operation Condor, which had already centralized information from South American intelligence agencies for years, was at its height. Chilean exiles in Argentina were threatened again, and {{had to go into}} hiding or seek refuge in a third country. Chilean General Carlos Prats had already been assassinated by the Chilean DINA in Buenos Aires in 1974, with the help of former DINA agents Michael Townley and Enrique Arancibia. Cuban diplomats were also assassinated in Buenos Aires in the infamous Automotores Orletti torture center, one of the 300 clandestine prisons of the dictatorship, managed by the Grupo de Tareas 18, headed by Aníbal Gordon, previously convicted for armed robbery, and answered directly to the General Commandant of the SIDE, Otto Paladino. Automotores Orletti was the main base of foreign intelligence services involved in Operation Condor. One of the survivors, José Luis Bertazzo, who was detained for two months there, identified Chileans, Uruguayans, Paraguayans and Bolivians among the prisoners. These captives were interrogated by agents from their own countries.|$|E
500|$|Historian A.J.P. Taylor labeled Lansbury as [...] "the most lovable {{figure in}} modern politics" [...] and the {{outstanding}} {{figure of the}} English <b>revolutionary</b> <b>left</b> in the 20th century, while Kenneth O. Morgan, in his biography of a later Labour leader, Michael Foot, regards Lansbury as [...] "an agitator of protest, not a politician of power". [...] Journalists commonly accused Lansbury of [...] sentimentality, and [...] party intellectuals accused him of lacking mental capacity. Nevertheless, [...] his speeches in the House of Commons were often flavoured with historical and literary allusions, and he left behind a considerable body of writing on socialist ideas; Morgan refers {{to him as a}} [...] "prophet". Foot, who as a young man met and was influenced by Lansbury, was particularly impressed by the older man's achievements in establishing the [...] Daily Herald, given his complete lack of journalistic training. Nevertheless, Foot felt that Lansbury's pacifism was unrealistic, and believed that Bevin's demolition at the 1935 conference was justified.|$|E
500|$|Washington Square Park {{has been}} the {{geographic}} center of Chicago public speeches. [...] By the 1890s the park acquired its Bughouse Square moniker. Soapbox orators waxed on topics ranging from gender relations to Communism. It served as a home for soapbox orators on warm-weather evenings from the 1910s to the mid-1960s. [...] Like Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park, Washington Square became a popular spot for soap box orators. Artists, writers, political radicals, and hobos pontificated, lectured, recited poetry, ranted, and raved. A group of regulars formed [...] "The Dill Pickle Club," [...] devoted to free expression. For years Washington Square orators appointed their own honorary [...] "king." [...] In its heyday in the 1920s and 1930s, <b>revolutionary</b> <b>left</b> soapboxers were occasionally joined by poets, religionists, and cranks. In 1959, the city transferred Washington Square to the Chicago Park District. In 1964, Life featured an article {{saying that it was}} a meeting place for cottaging among homosexuals. Six years later, it played host to Chicago's first Gay Pride March.|$|E
50|$|The Asturias revolt {{was another}} defeat for the European left - in Germany Hitler had {{destroyed}} organized labour, liquidating Europe's strongest communist party, in Austria, the Catholic corporatist Dolfuss, admired by the CEDA, had used paramilitary forces to crush Viennese Marxists of all varieties. To the right Asturias was {{proof of the}} <b>revolutionary</b> <b>left's</b> plans for Spain. The rebels had murdered thirty-four priests and seminarians - the most clerical blood spilt in Spain in over a hundred years.|$|R

50|$|The Swedish Social Democratic Party {{has played}} a leading {{political}} role since 1917, after Reformists confirmed their strength and the <b>revolutionaries</b> <b>left</b> the party. After 1932, the Cabinets have been dominated by the Social Democrats. Only five general elections (1976, 1979, 1991, 2006 and 2010) have given the centre-right bloc enough seats in the Riksdag to form a government. This is considered {{one reason for the}} Swedish post-war welfare state, with a government expenditure of slightly more than 50% of the gross domestic product.|$|R
2500|$|The International {{divided into}} a <b>revolutionary</b> <b>left</b> and a reformist right, with a center group {{wavering}} between those poles. Lenin condemned {{much of the}} center as social-pacifists for several reasons, including their voting for war credits despite opposing the war. Lenin's term [...] "social-pacifist" [...] aimed in particular at Ramsay MacDonald, leader of the Independent Labour Party in Britain, who opposed the war on grounds of pacifism, but did not actively resist it.|$|E
2500|$|According to Chilean {{political}} scientist Arturo Valenzuela (later becoming a United States citizen and Assistant Secretary of State for Hemispheric Affairs in the Obama administration), {{a greater share}} of the blame for the breakdown in Chilean democracy lay with the leftist Allende government. While each side increasingly distrusted the other, the extreme leftists accelerated the process and left less room for political moderation than the extreme rightists. He writes [...] "By its actions, the <b>revolutionary</b> <b>Left,</b> which had always ridiculed the possibility of a socialist transformation through peaceful means, was engaged in a self-fulfilling prophecy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1929 Communist Parties {{around the}} world were purged of {{so-called}} [...] "Right Oppositions" [...] by the Communist International as the world Communist movement lurched towards the <b>revolutionary</b> <b>left.</b> Together with his factional co-thinker Jay Lovestone, Ben Gitlow was expelled from the party as purported supporters of Nikolai Bukharin in the USSR {{in opposition to the}} hardline faction of Joseph Stalin. The expelled Communists followed Lovestone into a new organization, the so-called Communist Party (Majority Group), which actually included {{a small fraction of the}} membership of the regular Communist Party.|$|E

50|$|In the {{emerging}} Soviet state, there appeared left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks which were {{a series of}} rebellions and uprisings against the Bolsheviks led or supported by left wing groups including Socialist <b>Revolutionaries,</b> <b>Left</b> Socialist <b>Revolutionaries,</b> Mensheviks, and anarchists. Some were {{in support of the}} White Movement while some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the Russian Civil War and after until 1922. In response, the Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the government and suppressed them with force.|$|R

2500|$|While {{living in}} Canada, Rodríguez became {{very active in}} the Chilean {{resistance}} to the Pinochet regime. When in Vancouver, Rodríguez had her Chilean passport seized {{as a result of}} her outspoken views on crimes against Chilean human rights. Thus, Rodríguez was forbidden to visit countries outside Canada until she obtained her Canadian citizenship in 1979. That year, Rodríguez, along with her daughters and Bob, her Canadian partner, traveled to Argentina and Bolivia to [...] "collaborate with the armed resistances organization, the Movement for the <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Left</b> (MIR)", a socialist party. Rodríguez has yet to reveal the details of her underground work there.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the height}} of Argentine left-wing terrorism, the Cubans used their embassy in Buenos Aires to {{maintain}} direct contact with Argentine guerrillas. In 1973, the Montoneros merged with the Cuban-backed FAR (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias or Armed Revolutionary Forces) that in 1972 had planted a bomb in the Sheraton hotel in Buenos Aires that killed a Canadian tourist. On 13 February 1974, a clandestine meeting was held in Mendoza, Argentina, and the Junta de Coordinacion Revolucionaria (JCR or Junta of Revolutionary Coordination) was formed. The JCR consisted of four guerrilla groups: the Uruguayan Tupamaros (MLN-T), the Chilean Movement of the <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Left</b> (MIR) and the Bolivian Revolutionary Army (ELN). The ERP guerrillas maintained a guerrilla warfare training school, an arms factory, and a false documentation center in Argentina. These were all closed down in 1975 by Argentine security forces. In 1976, ERP guerrillas started receiving training in Cuba on an 1800 hectare (7 square miles) estate near Guanabo {{as well as at}} another site in Pinar del Rio. In July 2008, Fidel Castro admitted that he backed left-wing radicals and guerrilla forces in Argentina in order to start an armed revolution: [...] "The only place where we didn't promote a revolution was in Mexico. In the rest (of Latin America) we tried, without exception." ...|$|E

50|$|About 16 of {{the group}} {{captured}} the European club's headquarters (in Pahartali, now the Railway Office next to Shahjahan Field) but there were few club members present because of it being Good Friday.

After the raids, the revolutionaries gathered outside the police armoury, where Sen took a military salute, hoisted a national flag, and proclaimed a Provisional Revolutionary Government. The <b>revolutionaries</b> <b>left</b> Chittagong town before dawn and marched towards the Chittagong hill ranges, looking for a safe place to hide.|$|R

The ISC and the IWUSP joined to form the Labour and Socialist International (LSI) in May 1923 at a meeting in Hamburg Left wing groups {{which did not}} agree to the {{centralisation}} and abandonment of the soviets by the Bolshevik Party led Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks; such groups included Socialist <b>Revolutionaries,</b> <b>Left</b> Socialist <b>Revolutionaries,</b> Mensheviks, and anarchists.|$|R
