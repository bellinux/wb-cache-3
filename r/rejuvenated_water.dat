50|$|Having {{been left}} alone {{since the death}} of his 'breed friend and ally Rachel at the {{conclusion}} of the first series, Raymond Stoner leaves Elsewhere and tries to find inner peace in a Nepalese Sanctuary in an attempt to banish his (literal) personal demons. Having no success, he leaves the Temple and hones his martial skills fighting in various South American wars, with and against varied rebels and gangsters, but cannot shake off the CIA and the Demons, both of whom are hunting him. He learns more about the nature of these demons and their aims, and realises he must choose whether to side with humanity in the confrontation which is about to come. Rejecting an offer to join the demons, he battles with the highest level demon he has yet encountered - with the aid of Rachel's spirit - yet his victory comes at a heavy price when the fountain which provides him with his <b>rejuvenating</b> <b>water</b> is destroyed in the battle.|$|R

40|$|Groundwater {{accounts}} for a major portion ¿ as much as 80 per cent ¿ of domestic and irrigation water in Gujarat. The state has witnessed a 104 per cent increase in groundwater extraction between 1978 and 1997. In 1996 - 97 groundwater provided for 79 per cent of the net irrigated area {{of the state and}} for 78 per cent of the rural drinking water needs. This dependence has caused a rapid decline in groundwater levels, about 2. 5 - 3. 6 metres per year. The decline in water levels has affected about 4. 0 million ha (21 per cent of the total area of the state) in 74 talukas of 14 districts of the state. The situation is likely to worsen since about 87 per cent of the municipal towns in Gujarat depend on groundwater to meet their drinking, domestic and other needs. The Government of Gujarat, in its Master Plan 1999 - 2000, allocated Rs 3, 108. 88 million to mitigate the problem. The investment was meant to improve services in 6, 312 villages, 69 towns and three areas that municipal corporations served by drilling new bore wells, deep tubewells and <b>rejuvenating</b> <b>water</b> supply schemes...|$|R

50|$|Gouves {{village is}} also known as Kato Gouves. It is a village by the sea with a clear tourist orientation; located 18 km east of Heraklion city and just 3 km from Gournes Village. There is easy and fast access to the village by {{following}} the old national road of Heraklion- Lasithi and then taking the vertical road that runs across the village as its main road that ends up at its coastline. At the entrance of the village visitors will see the Central Fountain that provides lots of cool and <b>rejuvenating</b> <b>water</b> and also a wide parking area. Alongside in the main road we meet a vast number of local hotel resorts with a range of 5-star hotels to simple room to let facilities that will fulfill every need of accommodation even for the most demanding visitors. Moreover, on the main road a number of local businesses provide clothing, jewellery, gifts shops as well as taverns with delicious cuisine. Ending on the coastline of the village a number of cafes, taverns and clubs will conclude a full spectrum of things to do and places to visit, with a unique atmosphere of both romantic and rejuvenating essence for every visitor to live and experience.|$|R
5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the <b>rejuvenating</b> <b>water</b> of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.|$|R

They {{underwent}} the same training as their male counterparts, covering the handling of weapons, detection and disposal of bombs, driving, horseriding, and adventure sports. The government led by her in 2003 banned sale of all lotteries, including online, within the territory of the state, despite the risk of the state losing revenue. She gave orders to special task force headed by K.Vijaykumar to conduct secret operation to capture and kill the dreaded poacher and sandalwood smuggler Veerappan by entering Karnataka. In 2004 she declared eliminating Verappan aa biggest achievement of her government and quoted [...] ""My only brief to them was capture Veerappan dead or alive. After that I never interfered. I left them to work out their own strategies and this paid off." [...] She began to be referred as 'People's CM'Mudhalvar and Iron Lady of India by end of this term. In this term she launched Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) scheme in 2001 to <b>rejuvenate</b> <b>water</b> sources and this improved ground water levels in the parched southern state and this idea was replicated by various states and even by the Centre. She also started the Veeranam project to deliver water to the dry metropolis of Chennai. Doctor Manmohan Singh frequently praised Jayalalithaa for her administrative skills, mid-day meal schemes and efforts for gender empowerment.|$|R

5|$|In state {{legislative}} assembly elections in May 2016, the AIADMK {{was returned to}} power in Tamil Nadu, albeit with a reduced majority. The party lost eight seats to the opposing DMK in Chennai district and a further eight seats elsewhere; its losses were attributed to its perceived failure to properly address the flood crisis. On 16 June, K. Rosaiah, the governor of Tamil Nadu, announced the state government would soon develop comprehensive flood protection plans for Chennai and its surrounding coastal districts; he said the emphasis would be on providing better roads, storm water drains, solid waste management, sewerage management and street lights. The initiatives would be synergised with the Smart Cities Programme and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation scheme. Funding had also been obtained from the World Bank and from the Asian Development Bank for climate-change impact reduction initiatives, {{as well as for}} the restoration of water bodies and tanks. As of July 2016, however, local citizens' groups said no constructive work had been done to <b>rejuvenate</b> local <b>water</b> bodies and that the effects of a similar north-east monsoon would have an equally destructive impact.|$|R

Don Rosa's solution to the issue of Scrooge's age is that he set all of his stories in the 1950s or earlier, which was when he himself discovered and reveled in Barks's stories as a kid, and in his unofficial timelines, he had Scrooge die in 1967, at the age of 100 years.|$|R
40|$|Being {{restricted}} in their vertical development by the Tibetan high, monsoon depressions propagate westward against monsoon westerlies {{embedded in the}} Indian monsoon trough. The cause of this peculiar propagation has not been well explained. Special characteristics of individual depressions were revealed from observations of previous studies; particularly, the major rainfall of a depression occurs over its west–south-west sector. The latent heat released by this rainfall forms east–west differential heating across the depression in developing an east–west asymmetric circulation. Because this east–west circulation {{is a part of}} the depression’s divergent circulation, a spatial quadrature relationship exists between this divergent circulation and the depression. Based on these characteristics, a westward propagation mechanism of the depression is introduced. The depression’s rainfall is supported by the convergence of water vapor transported by the low-level divergent circulation. In turn, the divergent circulation is maintained through a feedback of the latent heat released by the rainfall. The upward branch of the east–west circulation coupled with the convergent center of the low-level divergent circulation generates a negative streamfunction tendency. The depression is propagated westward by a dynamic interaction between rainfall/convection and this monsoon disturbance through the negative streamfunction tendency. The spatial quadrature relationship between a depression and its east–west (divergent) circulation <b>rejuvenates</b> the <b>water</b> vapor supply maintaining diabatic heating and the divergent circulation, and perpetuatin...|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} {{book of the}} Twig trilogy, the Mother Storm was {{returning}} to <b>rejuvenate</b> the <b>waters</b> of Riverrise, as it had done for aeons. All would have been well, {{if not for the}} fact that the floating city of Sanctaphrax was in its way this time. The Mother Storm would waste its energy destroying Sanctaphrax, and the drought would wipe out all life on the Edge. Twig Vergenix had been told of this, but he had lost his memory when an explosion destroyed his ship, the Edgedancer. Twig and his apprentice, Cowlquape, searched for his crewmember Maugin, hoping that she might have remembered about the impending disaster. The search led them to Riverrise, where they found her. She remembered what Quintinius Verginix had said before he ceased to exist, and spurred Twig's memory - the Mother Storm would strike at dawn over Riverrise, or Midnight over Sanctaphrax. There was not time to walk back to Sanctaphrax and cut the Great Anchor Chain, so Twig and Cowlquape were tied to a burning lufwood tree. Lufwood becomes buoyant when it is burned, so Twig and Cowlquape were fired to Sanctaphrax. The process is called sky-firing, and would have blasted them into Open Sky had they not aimed it at Sanctaphrax. Cowlquape cut the Anchor Chain, and Sanctaphrax floated away, allowing the Mother Storm to continue unimpeded to Riverrise.|$|R
50|$|Every few {{thousand}} years, the Edgewater River dried {{up and the}} Mother Storm would descend upon Riverrise, The legendary source of the river, and would <b>rejuvenate</b> its <b>waters</b> at dawn. The previous time the mother storm came to the Edge, its path had been clear. But now, Sanctaphrax was in its way. The Mother Storm was preceded by many bizarre changes in the weather. These included mist which inflamed tempers and hailstones as large as boulders which brought inexplicable despair. These brought the hitherto obscure School of Psycho-Climatic Studies into prominence until the Storm arrived. Twig returned from his voyage into open sky with no memory of what his father had told him there. However, when he journeyed to Riverrise his memory was jogged, and he remembered the impending disaster and realized the solution. The great anchor chain had to be cut, allowing Sanctaphrax to fly away. If it wasn’t cut, the mother storm would waste its energy destroying Sanctaphrax, and would not get to Riverrise. The drought would wipe out all life on the Edge. When Twig and his apprentice, Cowlquape returned. Sanctaphrax (already devastated by the freak weather conditions) was on {{the very edge of}} the Mother Storm. Twig had sent word ahead to evacuate Sanctaphrax, although a few of the old professors stayed on it. The professor of darkness could not allow Twig to destroy the city, so he shoved him aside. Twig yelled for Cowlquape to remove the pin that held Sanctaphrax in place, and he did. The Professor of darkness begged Cowlquape to stop, and just before the pin gave, he thrust the great seal of office into Cowlquape’s hand. The chain then unwound and Sanctaphrax flew off, with the Professor of Darkness hanging on to the end of the chain.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to link water, history and culture through {{architectural}} and urban design by researching {{the potential for the}} rejuvenation of a neglected industrial site {{at the edge of a}} river. The Malden River in Massachusetts, one of the most polluted rivers in the Boston Harbor Watershed, was utilized by heavy industry during the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries for the purposes of power generation, shipping and waste removal. As the advent of modern urban systems for drainage and transport replaced the river's traditional roles, the waterfront has fallen into disuse and has become a classic post-industrial landscape. It is abandoned and contaminated, surrounded by old industrial buildings and warehouses and is more commonly known as a "brownfield. " In order to re-evaluate the relationship between water and contemporary urban culture, this thesis explores the creation of a metaphorical "source" for the river so as to establish a new and fundamental bond between the architecture and the site. The source is of critical importance due to symbolic issues of quality, origin, and renewal. The selected site, sandwiched between the towns of Medford and Everett, is chosen to celebrate and demarcate the origin of the river, and second to <b>rejuvenate</b> the <b>water</b> front and surrounding industrial landscape, which is overgrown and polluted. These intentions are accomplished using two scales of design intervention. At one scale(the urban scale), water filtration technologies such as slow sand filtration and landscape design are brought together to create a civic space that creates a symbolic "source" for the river and celebrates its renewal. At a smaller scale, architectural interventions include a series of programs that will help develop a community awareness of the delicate relationship between culture and water. This program includes: a water research center, research library, auditorium, gallery, studio, observation tower, teahouse, restaurant and café. These programmatic aspects serve to generate activity that will bring life to the site and surrounding communities. by Kazuyo Oda. Thesis (M. Arch.)
