5000|$|The Maxaret {{system had}} four main parts, {{all of which}} weighed only 4.7 pounds and fit within the small {{confines}} of a main landing gear wheel. The system was entirely mechanical, and worked by measuring the relative speed of two spinning disks. The first, the [...] "drum", {{was surrounded by a}} rubber disk and arranged within the aircraft wheel's internal periphery, so that the rubber maintained strong mechanical contact with the wheel. The second, a flywheel, was attached to the <b>drum</b> with a <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch.</b> Normally, with the wheel turning, the wheel would spin the drum, which would spin the flywheel, so that all of the moving parts were spinning at the same speed.|$|R
40|$|A four-degree-of-freedom {{nonlinear}} transverse and {{torsional vibration}} model of spur {{gear transmission system}} for <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch,</b> two-shaft assembly was developed, in which the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch</b> was modeled as a piecewise nonlinear spring with discontinuous stiffness, considering the {{factors such as the}} time-varying gear mesh stiffness, static transmission error, and nonlinearity backlash. With the help of bifurcation diagrams, time domain response diagrams, phase plane diagrams, and Poincaré maps, the effects of the excitation frequency and the torsional stiffness of <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch</b> on the dynamic behavior of gear transmission system for <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch,</b> two-shaft assembly are investigated in detail by using Runge-Kutta method. Numerical results reveal that the system response involves period- 1 motion, multiperiodic motion, bifurcation, and chaotic motion.

30|$|Since the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch</b> has maximum transmittable torque, the transmittable torque of {{the outer}} shaft is limited by torque {{capacity}} of the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch.</b> However walking robots normally require high torque in one direction that gravity works, we deploy wire driven mechanism as the core shaft supports {{the direction of the}} gravity force.|$|R
30|$|The {{problem of}} using the wire driven {{mechanism}} is an elongation of a wire, which decreases mechanical bandwidth. Therefore {{to be able to}} adjust wire tension easily a co-axial tensioner shaft shown in Fig. 13 was devised as the input pulley. The co-axial tensioner shaft has a dual structure made up of a core shaft which passes {{through the center of the}} input axis pulley, and an outer shaft which covers the lower half. Each shaft is connected with a compact roller type <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch</b> (NTN: HF 0612, torque capacity 1.76  Nm). Due to the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch,</b> the two shafts turn relative to each other only in the direction which increases wire tension, and thus it is possible to adjust tension of the wire by rotating one of the shafts. The wire which is wound to the core shaft transmit power directly to the motor, but the wire wound to the outer shaft transmit power via <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|R

50|$|A torque {{converter}} cannot achieve 100 percent coupling efficiency. The classic three element {{torque converter}} has an efficiency curve that resembles ∩: zero efficiency at stall, generally increasing efficiency during the acceleration phase and low efficiency in the coupling phase. The loss of efficiency as the converter enters the coupling phase {{is a result}} of the turbulence and fluid flow interference generated by the stator, and as previously mentioned, is commonly overcome by mounting the stator on a <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The key {{characteristic}} of a torque converter {{is its ability to}} multiply torque when the output rotational speed is so low that it allows the fluid coming off the curved vanes of the turbine to be deflected off the stator while it is locked against its <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch,</b> thus providing the equivalent of a reduction gear. This is a feature beyond that of the simple fluid coupling, which can match rotational speed but does not multiply torque, thus reduces power.|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{load capacity}} and durability of the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutches</b> with simultaneous reduction of mass-dimensional characteristics is largely governed by improving the calculation {{procedures of the}} stress-strain state of their basic elements. Best operating practices of roller <b>one-way</b> <b>clutches</b> in drive machines show that the outer shell {{is one of the}} most loaded elements that has an impact on the working capacity of clutches as a whole. Although, when working in the drive machine, the outer shell destruction may occur quite often, its stress-strain state is, usually, calculated by the approximate and simplified formulas to calculate the rings of the simple shape with the uniform stress distribution over the cross-sections. To study and define the impact nature of the geometrical parameters of the outer shell on its arising stress and strain, solid-state computer simulation and calculation has been performed in the national T-FLEX CAD software complex by the finite element method. The article proposes to use the influence coefficients to estimate an extent of the impact of different geometrical parameters. During the computational experiment, the geometric parameters were varied in ranges corresponding to the main dimension types of the clutches used in drive machines: the inner diameter of the shell – = 40 - 240 мм; the number of block rollers - = 3 - 5; the relative thickness of the shell – = 0, 06 - 0, 14; the relative thickness of the plate – = 0, 04 - 0, 12; relative to the length of the shell = 0, 20 - 0, 50. It has been found that with changing shell thickness the values of arising stresses and strains decrease, respectively, 2. 05 and 2. 19 times more than with changing plate thickness. Processing of results of computational experiments allowed us to obtain the empirical formulas to calculate a stress-strain state in any combination and in a wide range of changing geometrical parameters of the outer shell. The proposed procedure allows us to raise the reliability and computational accuracy of the stress-strain state of the outer shell of the <b>one-way</b> <b>clutches.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|During {{the stall}} and {{acceleration}} phases, in which torque multiplication occurs, the stator remains stationary {{due to the}} action of its <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch.</b> However, as the torque converter approaches the coupling phase, the energy and volume of the fluid returning from the turbine will gradually decrease, causing pressure on the stator to likewise decrease. Once in the coupling phase, the returning fluid will reverse direction and now rotate {{in the direction of}} the impeller and turbine, an effect which will attempt to forward-rotate the stator. At this point, the stator clutch will release and the impeller, turbine and stator will all (more or less) turn as a unit.|$|R

50|$|When a skid developed, {{the wheel}} would stop, {{stopping}} the drum along with it. The flywheel, {{driven by the}} <b>one-way</b> <b>clutch,</b> continued to spin. If the relative angle between the drum and flywheel reached 60 degrees, the drum would be driven forward to press on a valve. This released brake fluid into a reservoir, lowering hydraulic pressure, and releasing the brakes. As soon as the drum started spinning again and reached the (slowing) speed of the flywheel, the valve was released and the brakes re-applied. The system could cycle about ten times a second, and could hold the brakes off for up to four seconds in total before the reservoir filled.|$|R

The transmission ratio is adjusted by changing linkage geometry within the oscillating elements, so that the summed maximum linkage speed is adjusted, even when the average linkage speed remains constant.

This paper presents a methodology, which overcomes this limitation {{by the use of}} meta-models. These meta-models are used to represent the deviations as well as the effects of other deviations towards those (interactions). Since meta-models are approximations, a certain error appears. Hence, the accuracy of a tolerance analysis depends largely on the meta-model’s prediction quality.
