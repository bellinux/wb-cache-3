5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} <b>remelted</b> in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were <b>remelted</b> in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached {{the bottom of the}} furnace.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} <b>remelted</b> in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process.|$|E

Pigott of the University of Pennsylvania {{states that}} the cupola furnace existed in China at least by the Warring States period (403–221 BC), while Donald B. Wagner writes that some iron ore melted in the blast furnace may have been cast directly into molds, but most, if not all, iron smelted in the blast furnace during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) was <b>remelted</b> in a cupola furnace; it was designed so that a cold blast injected at the bottom traveled through tuyere pipes across the top where the charge (i.e. of charcoal and scrap or pig iron) was dumped, the air becoming a hot blast before reaching {{the bottom of the}} furnace where the iron was melted and then drained into appropriate molds for casting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present paper {{deals with}} {{residual}} {{stress and strain}} changes in thin flat specimens of nodular cast iron during laser <b>remelting</b> process. In laser <b>remelting</b> process of a workpiece we have used several laser beam passages across the workpiece surface. The state of internal stress in the workpiece changes because of different ways of guiding the laser beam across the workpiece surface, and consequently strain of the workpiece may occur. In the process of gradual <b>remelting</b> of the specimen surface, i. e. during its heating and cooling, volume changes in the specimen surface layer occur due to thermal and microstructural changes. To {{find out more about}} volume changes in the thin surface layer of specimens, the latter were monitored by measuring the strain at the lower side of the specimens during and after the <b>remelting</b> process, and also by residual stress measurement in the thin surface layer. The results obtained confirm that the laser <b>remelting</b> process could be successfully optimised on the basis of knowing the residual stresses and the strain generated during the <b>remelting</b> process...|$|R

25|$|The Platinum Panda is {{a series}} of {{platinum}} coins of China produced from 1987 to 2005. The series is named after the image of giant panda printed on the reverse of all coins. The People's Bank of China minted 8,300 one-ounce Platinum Panda coins between 1987 and 1990 with a face value of 100 yuan. Additionally, 5,450 ounces of platinum were used for coins of smaller denominations in the 1990s through {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. Minting was discontinued in 2005, mostly due to the increasing price of platinum; while in 1990 the price was about US $490/oz, it crossed the $2,000 mark in the summer of 2008. All Platinum Pandas, except for coins of 2004–2005, are very rare and their availability can not be judged from the minted volumes. This is partly because some coins had been <b>remelted.</b>|$|E
