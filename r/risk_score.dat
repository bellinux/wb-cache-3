5|$|Many {{genes are}} known to be {{involved}} in schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression. The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic <b>risk</b> <b>score</b> can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.|$|E

40|$|People {{with type}} 2 {{diabetes}} have {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multivariate cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> have been used in many countries to identify individuals who are at high risk of CVD. These <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> include those originally developed in individuals with diabetes and those developed in a general population. This article reviews the published evidence for the performance of CVD <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> in diabetic patients by: (1) examining the overall rationale for using risk scores; (2) systematically reviewing the literature on available scores; and (3) exploring methodological issues surrounding the development, validation and comparison of <b>risk</b> <b>scores.</b> The predictive performance of cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> varies substantially between different populations. There is little evidence to suggest that <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> developed in individuals with diabetes estimate cardiovascular risk more accurately than those developed in the general population. The inconsistency in the methods used in evaluation studies makes it difficult to compare and summarise the predictive ability of <b>risk</b> <b>scores.</b> Overall, CVD <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> rank individuals reasonably accurately and are therefore useful in the management of diabetes with regard to targeting therapy to patients at highest risk. However, due to the uncertainty in estimation of true risk, care is needed when using scores to communicate absolute CVD risk to individuals...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> {{to predict}} occurrence of {{type 2 diabetes}} in the Dutch population. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Twelve basic <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> and 13 extensive <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> with biomarkers were used to predict {{the risk of developing}} type 2 diabetes during 7. 5 years in a prospective cohort of 38, 379 Dutch men and women. Occurrence of diabetes was documented through repeated questionnaires and validated against medical records. The capacity of the <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> to correctly identify those at high risk of developing diabetes was determined using the C-statistic. The capacity of the <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> to correctly quantify the absolute risk of diabetes was determined by testing the difference between the predicted and observed risk in the population. RESULTS: The capacity of basic <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> to identify those at high risk of diabetes was good, with C-statistics ranging from 0. 74 (95 %-CI: 0. 73 - 0. 75) to 0. 84 (0. 82 - 0. 85). The extended <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> were very capable of identifying those at high risk of diabetes, with C-statistics ranging from 0. 81 (0. 80 - 0. 83) to 0. 93 (0. 92 - 0. 94). Most <b>risk</b> <b>scores,</b> however, were unable to correctly quantify the absolute risk of diabetes; the risk was usually overestimated. Only the basic KORA model correctly quantified the risk in this Dutch population. CONCLUSION: In the Dutch population, <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> to predict the occurrence of type 2 diabetes are very capable of identifying those at high risk. Extension with biomarkers improves this capacity. Quantification of the absolute risk of diabetes was insufficient in most <b>risk</b> <b>scores...</b>|$|R

40|$|Trials have {{demonstrated}} the preventability of type 2 diabetes through lifestyle modifications or drugs in people with impaired glucose tolerance.

This article examines the evidence for performance of diabetes <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> in adults by 1) systematically reviewing the literature on available scores and 2) their validation in external populations; and 3) exploring methodological issues surrounding the development, validation, and comparison of <b>risk</b> <b>scores.</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>scores</b> show overall good discriminatory ability in populations for whom they were developed.

40|$|Background: Research on gene x {{environment}} {{interaction in}} {{major depressive disorder}} (MDD) has thus far primarily focused on candidate genes, although genetic effects {{are known to be}} polygenic. Aims: To test whether the effect of polygenic <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> on MDD is moderated by childhood trauma. Method: The study sample consisted of 1645 participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD and 340 screened controls from The Netherlands. Chronic or remitted episodes (severe MDD) were present in 956 participants. The occurrence of childhood trauma was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Interview and the polygenic <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> were based on genome-wide meta-analysis results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Results: The polygenic <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> and childhood trauma independently affected MDD risk, and evidence was found for interaction as departure from both multiplicativity and additivity, indicating that the effect of polygenic <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> on depression is increased in the presence of childhood trauma. The interaction effects were similar in predicting all MDD risk and severe MDD risk, and explained a proportion of variation in MDD risk comparable to the polygenic <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> themselves. Conclusions: The interaction effect found between polygenic <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> and childhood trauma implies that (1) studies on direct genetic effect on MDD gain power by focusing on individuals exposed to childhood trauma, and that (2) individuals with both high polygenic <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> and exposure to childhood trauma are particularly at risk for developing MDD...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: National {{guidance}} {{states that}} all patients having emergency surgery {{should have a}} mortality risk assessment calculated on admission so that the ‘high risk’ patient can receive the appropriate seniority and level of care. We aimed to assess if peri-operative <b>risk</b> <b>scoring</b> tools could accurately calculate mortality and morbidity risk. Methods: Mortality <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> for 86 consecutive emergency laparotomies, were calculated using pre-operative (ASA, Lee index) and post-operative (POSSUM, P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM) risk calculation tools. Morbidity <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> were calculated using the POSSUM predicted morbidity and compared against actual morbidity according to the Clavien–Dindo classification. Results: The actual mortality was 10. 5 %. The average predicted <b>risk</b> <b>scores</b> for all laparotomies were: ASA 26. 5 %, Lee Index 2. 5 %, POSSUM 29. 5 %, P-POSSUM 18. 5 %, CR-POSSUM 10. 5 %. Complications occurred following 67 laparotomies (78 %). The majority (51 %) of complications were classified as Clavien–Dindo grade 2 – 3 (non-life-threatening). Patients having a POSSUM morbidity risk of greater than 50 % developed significantly more life-threatening complications (CD 4 – 5) compared with those who predicted {{less than or equal}} to 50 % morbidity risk (P =  0. 01). Discussion: Pre-operative risk stratification remains a challenge because the Lee Index under-predicts and ASA over-predicts mortality <b>risk.</b> Post-operative <b>risk</b> <b>scoring</b> using the CR-POSSUM is more accurate and we suggest can be used to identify patients who require intensive care post-operatively.
