50|$|Runaway {{marriage}} (maritji) {{was accepted}} as orthodox if the kinship link considered the couple's <b>relation</b> <b>ship</b> licit. When mimicked by theatrical performances of the practice at large corroborees, maritji often elicits much laughter. Bride kidnapping, though traditionally practiced when no spouse could be obtained by the usual means, was, according to a white informant, undertaken by formal prearrangements made between the raiding tribe and the group from whom the woman was to be 'snatched', so the actual raid was a symbolic artifice rather than an act of violent intertribal competition for a scarce resource.|$|E
50|$|As in any moving-coil indicator, {{rotation}} of the measuring element is produced by forces which are proportional to product of the current and field strength,and the direction of rotation depends on the direction of current relative to the magnetic field. In a ratio meter, therefore, {{it follows that the}} force produced by one coil will always tend to rotate the measuring element in the opposite direction to the force produced by the second coil,and further more,as the magnetic field is of non-uniform strength,the coil carrying the greater current will always move towards the area of weaker field, and vice versa. When the temperature at the sensing element Rx increases, then in accordance with the temperature/resistance <b>relation</b> <b>ship</b> of the material used for the element, its resistance will increase and so cause a decrease in the force created by it.|$|E

Dog {{is the son of}} one of the maintenance men on his father's property and he would constantly bully and torment young James and {{he fell in love with}} Rose. To escape from his father, he learns to fight with knives from the gardener, Smitty, until he is caught after trying to stab Dog in a fight, getting Smitty fired. It doesn't stop Logan from training with him until he dies from alcoholism. After deciding to marry Rose, James goes to the garden to profess his love for her. Arriving early, however, he sees that she is having an affair with none other than Dog. Enraged, Logan takes out his knives left to him by Smitty and blacks out, waking up covered in blood and Dog scared and in a childlike state.|$|E

40|$|Summary. It {{is argued}} that social housing in the UK curren tly faces {{affordability}} and invest-ment problem s. Rental payments are highly dependent on housing bene ® ts and more investm ent, with higher rent levels and lower direct subsidy, requires more expenditure on housing bene ® ts if affordability problem s are to be avoided. The increasin g role of private ® nance in funding housing associat ion developments is reviewed. There is an exam ination of the institutional <b>relation</b> <b>ship</b> between social housing expenditure and the public de ® cit. The case for new forms of social housing organ isation s which are less restricted by public expenditure con trols is exam ined.
