40|$|This paper reviews 14 risk {{assessments}} {{that use the}} data from descriptions by Rinsky, Young, and co-workers of benzene-associated leukemias {{among a group of}} <b>rubber</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> workers in Ohio. The leukemogenic risks of benzene estimated in these assessments differ. The assessors use different assumptions (parameters, confounding factors, or formulas), which account for the differences in risk. The purpose of the review is to determine whether the major source of uncertainty in assessments of benzene risk arises from data, method, or concept. The results show that methodological differences dominate the other two potential sources with respect to impact on risk magnitude...|$|E

40|$|Enzymatic {{saturation}} of metabolic pathways is {{one factor}} that potentially contributes to the nonlinear exposure-response relations that are frequently reported in occupational epidemiologic studies. The authors propose an approach to explore the contribution of saturable metabolism to previously reported exposure-response relations by integrating predictive models of relevant biomarkers of exposure into the epidemiologic analysis. The approach is demonstrated with 2 studies of leukemia in benzene-exposed workers, one conducted in the Australian petroleum industry (1981 – 1999) and one conducted in a US <b>rubber</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> production factory in Ohio (1940 – 1996). The studies differed greatly in their magnitudes and durations of exposure. Substitution of biomarker levels for external estimates of benzene exposure reduced the fold difference of the log relative risk of leukemia per unit of cumulative exposure between the 2 studies by 11 %– 44 %. Nevertheless, a considerable difference in the log relative risk per unit of cumulative exposure remained between the 2 studies, suggesting that exposure misclassification, differences in study design, and potential confounding factors {{also contributed to the}} heterogeneity in risk estimates. benzene; case-control studies; cohort studies; leukemia; metabolism; occupational exposure; pharmacokinetics Abbreviation: AIC, Akaike Information Criterion.

40|$|The {{preservation}} {{and the quality}} of the kneaded meat products packed by various kinds of materials was studied. The five packing materials applied were poliethylen, polivinyl,rubber hydrochloride, cellophan and gut-string･The reaults obtained were as follows: 1. In the case of storage in the room,the materials rich in air-passing property like cellophan or gut-string give better result for the preservation than other packing materials. 2. Though cellophan and gut-string show good result for the preservation,the outward part of the contents appears to be deffective in quality in comparison with other packed materials, respecting the hardening and shrinkage of the contents of the forwers. 3. Poliethylen, polivinyl and <b>rubber</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> show a few loss inweight and good outward appearance,though the judgment of quality of the contents is difficult in the case of the storage in air-passing property･ 4. The packed meat shows good result for the preservation in comparison with the non-packed. 5. The packing and heating the products,as a rule､ give better result for the preservation than the simple outside packing･ 6. The gum-system membrane shows good result for the preservation in comparison with the cellulose-system membrane in the case of the direct packing･ 7.

40|$|The {{films of}} <b>rubber</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (RH) and polyvinylidenchloride (PC) are commercially used for casing of fish sausage. But {{it has been}} {{recognized}} that the fish sausage cased with RH film is preserved longer in a good condition than that cased with PC film, and that PC film is not suitable for this purpose, especially in summer. The results of studies on the cause of difference in preservation period between the fish sausages cased with these two films are presented. At first, the aerial permeability test of the film {{was carried out by}} using resazurin. The result was that PC film was less permeable than RH film, so that there was no correlation between the aerial permeability of the films and the preservation period. It is known, moreover, that chlorine ion is liberated from RH film when heated, but the author 2 ̆ 7 s examination proved that it has no influence on the bacterial growth. In connection with this fact, it was confirmed that some substance liberated by heating from RH film inhibited the growth of bacteria. It is concerned with some of the compounding ingredients of rubber. It seems that the substance is liberated from RH film during heating process in the case of manufacturing fish sausage, and that it plays a part in inhibiting the growth of bacteria in the superficial portion of fish sausage. 塩酸ゴム(Rubber hydrochloride,以下RHと略記),ポリビニリデソクロライド(Polyvinylidenchloride,以下PCと略記) などのフィルムが魚肉ソーセージのケーシングとして主に使用されているが,PCフィルムで包装した方がRHフィルムを用いた場合よりも腐敗しやすいと一般に言われており,ことに夏季においてはPCフィルムは使用されていないようである. 貯蔵期間にこのような差の生ずる原因については報告を見ない. 著者は魚肉ソーセージの腐敗菌は嫌気性菌の場合もあるが,主として好気性菌であると報告されていることから考えて,両フィルムの通気性についてレサズリンを用いて検べたところ,RHフィルムがPCフィルムに較べて相当大きかつた. しかし,製造後の貯蔵期間はPCフィルムを用いた方がRHフィルムを用いた場合よりも逆に短かいことから推察すると空気の透過性とは無関係のようである. 一方著者はRHフィルムを加熱すると塩素イオンが遊離することから両フィルムの物理的性質よりも,むしろ化学的性質の差に基づくものであろうと考えて実験を行ない,加熱によつてRHフィルムからは微生物の増殖を阻害する物質が遊離されることを知り,その物質がRHの製造過程中に加えられる配合成分と関係のあることを確めた...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Benzene {{is a human}} carcinogen. Exposure to benzene {{occurs in}} {{occupational}} and environmental settings. OBJECTIVE: I evaluated variation in benzene-related leukemia with age at exposure and time since exposure. METHODS: I evaluated data from a cohort of 1, 845 <b>rubber</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> workers. Benzene exposure–leukemia mortality trends were estimated by applying proportional hazards regression methods. Temporal variation in the impact of benzene on leukemia rates was assessed via exposure time windows and fitting of a multistage cancer model. RESULTS: The association between leukemia mortality and benzene exposures was of greatest magnitude in the 10 years immediately after exposure [relative rate (RR) at 10 ppm-years = 1. 19; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 10 – 1. 29]; the association was of smaller magnitude in the period 10 to < 20 years after exposure (RR at 10 ppm-years = 1. 05; 95 % CI, 0. 97 – 1. 13); {{and there was no}} evidence of association ≥ 20 years after exposure. Leukemia was more strongly associated with benzene exposures accrued at ≥ 45 years of age (RR at 10 ppm-years = 1. 11; 95 % CI, 1. 04 – 1. 17) than with exposures accrued at younger ages (RR at 10 ppm-years = 1. 01; 95 % CI, 0. 92 – 1. 09). Jointly, these temporal effects can be efficiently modeled as a multistage process in which benzene exposure affects the penultimate stage in disease induction. CONCLUSIONS: Further attention should be given to evaluating the susceptibility of older workers to benzene-induced leukemia...|$|E
40|$|Significant benzene {{exposure}} {{has historically}} {{been associated with the}} development of a host of hematological disorders in humans and animals. In particular, benzene is known to cause disturbances of the peripheral blood, aplastic anemia and cancer of the lymphohematopoietic system. In 1928, the first modern report of an association between cancer and benzene exposure was published. This case report was followed by additional reports from around the world. In most instances, ailments resulted from long term, high level exposure to benzene found in glues, and through accidental industrial spills. Throughout the 19602 ̆ 7 s and 19702 ̆ 7 s, case reports accumulated linking benzene exposure to hematological cancers, particularly among leather workers in Turkey and Italy. At the time, only qualitative measures of benzene exposure were often available and most exposure information was based upon short term grab samples and subjective symptoms. However, this situation changed drastically in the mid- 1970 s, when the first report was published on a little known industry that manufactured <b>rubber</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> also known as Pliofilm. This clear film product was made from natural rubber latex and processing utilized benzene in multiple stages. It appeared from the outset that there were an unusually large number of acute leukemia cases in this cohort of workers. Since that time, multiple follow-up evaluations of the same cohort have attempted to refine the benzene exposure of these workers. Benzene has subsequently been classified as a human carcinogen by several regulatory bodies and the allowable 8 hour time-weighted average has been lowered to 1 ppm. In pursuing the goal of protecting workers, regulatory bodies utilize a linear extrapolation, or no threshold dose, approach to cancer causation. This methodology assumes that every exposure brings an incremental rise in risk. In this work, the linear extrapolation methodology is tested utilizing the criteria proposed by Sir Bradford Hill. The Hill Criteria are used to critically evaluate the weight of evidence for a threshold dose that can cause hematological cancer in humans following benzene exposure. This evaluation revealed that there is sufficient evidence for a threshold dose and that linear extrapolation is designed to protect, not predict disease...|$|E
