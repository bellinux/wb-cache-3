40|$|The top {{priority}} of car-tire suppliers {{is to improve}} wetland grip force of the using tires, reduce the rolling resistance and the rolling noise of tires. It is urgent for the tire industry to research and develop high-performance tires to solve the above problems. They must use the high- performance synthetic rubber and auxiliary rubber to develop the most advanced manufacturing technologies and equipment. Silica, a kind of important tire auxiliary rubber, can significantly reduce the rolling resistance of tires, improve the grip force and properties resistant to ice, wetness or slippery of tires. In this paper, based on the conventional tire <b>rubber</b> <b>forming</b> technologies of extrusion, dewatering, drying and expanding, a study is made on the conical screw, the dewatering barrel, the drying barrel, the pin layout scheme, the expanding die head, cutter and the control system. The nonlinear pin <b>rubber</b> <b>forming</b> equipment integrating the functions of extrusion, dewatering, drying and expanding is designed and applied to tire auxiliary <b>rubber</b> <b>forming.</b> The experiment shows that the forming device can realize the one-step forming, with high forming efficiency, low cost and less labor. ...|$|R

In the soft material sheet Al 1050, deeper channels are formed than in materials SS 304 and Ti-G 5. Formed channel depth was increased when hardness of rubber pad was lower, thickness of rubber pad was high, and speed and pressure of punch were high. It was found the deepest channel was achieved when forming process condition was set with punch speed and pressure at 30 mm/s and 55 MPs, respectively using rubber pad having hardness Shore A 20 and thickness 60 mm. The channel depths of bipolar plates formed with Al 1050, SS 304 and Ti-G 5 under the above process condition were 0. 453, 0. 307, and 0. 270 mm, respectively...|$|R

In order to improve the hardness and resistance to wear and prolong the use life of the oilstone <b>forming</b> <b>die,</b> the boronizing technology was used on the work face of the oilstone <b>forming</b> <b>die.</b> There are some of elements such as B、C、Al、 Cr、Si and Fe etc in boronizing layer, all of them change their contents during boronizing. Maximum value of microhardness of boronizing layer appears in subsurface, not in surface, and lows along depth of boronizing layer. The abrasion resistance of boronizing layer comes out maximum after quenching and tempering.

40|$|<b>Rubber</b> <b>forming</b> is {{a common}} process for the {{fabrication}} of flanged metallic parts in the aerospace industry. The process enables cheap tooling, which is important since the product series are limited. In the process a rigid and a soft tool are combined to form a metal blank into the required shape. Most components made in this way are “flanged parts”, i. e. parts with a rather flat web plate and curved flanges at {{the periphery of the}} web plate. For flanged parts the determination of spring back of the flanges, straight or curved, is important, since the <b>forming</b> <b>dies</b> compensated with the spring back, should result in accurate products. Like all metal forming processes elastic and plastic deformations are combined in the same process cycle. The elastic deformations result in spring back and residual stresses, the ratio between these two depends on the shape of the product and the distribution of the plastic and elastic deformations. In this research an aluminium alloy was used. The low Young’s modulus of this alloy results in rather high elastic responses upon deformation. Other aspects that have been evaluated are the effect of processing parameters like friction and distribution of strains. For stretch flanges the strain is distributed evenly along the flange, but not for shrink flanges, where buckling plays a role. Experimental research shows that the spring back of the flanges depend on a number of variables like the thickness, flange geometry, and material parameters. The spring back of a flange is also a mixture of different contributions: spring back due to the bending over the bend line, spring back due to the curvature of the flange, and spring back due to in-plane deformations. The research performed focused on the different components of the spring back and their interaction. Analysis of the data resulted in a new parameter by which a number of variables could be captured. This improves the understanding of the spring back phenomena and a generalization of the results...|$|R

50|$|The Marform process, for example, {{operates}} {{using the}} principle of <b>rubber</b> pad <b>forming</b> techniques. Deep-recessed parts with either vertical or sloped walls can be formed. In this type of <b>forming,</b> the <b>die</b> rig employs a rubber pad as one tool half and a solid tool half, similar to the die in a conventional <b>die</b> set, to <b>form</b> a component into its final shape. Dies are made of cast light alloys and the rubber pad is 1.5-2 times thicker than the component to be formed. For Marforming, single-action presses are equipped with die cushions and blank holders. The blank is held against the rubber pad by a blank holder, through which a punch is acting as in conventional deep drawing. It is a double-acting apparatus: at first the ram slides down, then the blank holder moves: this feature allows it to perform deep drawings (30-40% transverse dimension) with no wrinkles.|$|R
