50|$|Testing {{the rack}} {{in its place}} allows it to fall until the tail rests on the lowest step of the snail. The hook of the rack should then hold the rack {{so that there are}} twelve teeth {{gathered}} up. Trying it on the highest step of the snail, should catch the first rack tooth. This leaves only one to be gathered up. If the clock strikes thirteen when on the lowest step and two when on the highest, it shows {{that the end of the}} rack tail is a little too far off from the snail and must be set a little closer. If on the other hand the snail strikes the right number when on the lowest step and two when on the highest, then the proportion between the snail and rack is wrong. The <b>rack</b> <b>travel</b> is too great for the rack.|$|E
5000|$|For the steering, the {{predominant}} system was a variable-ratio Bishop-design design (modified to provide 46 to 67 mm of <b>rack</b> <b>travel</b> per pinion revolution against the VS' 40 to 58 mm, and a 10.9 m kerb to kerb turning circle for the sedan). The Calais, instead, adopted a speed sensitive [...] "Variotronic" [...] mechanism, criticized for its overall feel. This {{and other new}} electronic systems (such as traction control standard on the Commodore Acclaim and the Calais, and all optional on all other models; to headlights that automatically extinguished themselves some time after parking and the Calais' key-based memory settings) were possible thanks to a multiplex communication bus. This setup was able to circulate 330 parameters per second to the car's major control modules, and {{reduce the number of}} hardwired circuits than if it had conventional wiring throughout (with the VT-series Calais featuring 73 fewer against the VS equivalent). Anti-theft devices included an improved electronic immobiliser (with an extra 16 million codes compared to the VS'), stronger steering lock and latest slip-type locks throughout.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explains}} the optimization of control parameters used for optimum control of torque and fuel {{delivered by the}} FIP of the Automotive engine. The parameters observed were fuel delivery, input current to driving motor, rpm of the pump, control <b>rack</b> <b>travel</b> and number of strokes. The fuel-injection system is the most vital component in the working of CI engine. The engine performance (power output, efficiency) is greatly dependent {{on the effectiveness of}} the fuel injection system and its parameters. The experiment is conducted on two MICO Bosch FIP of TATA Engine (TATA 207 and TATA Sumo FIP) as per DoE using three input parameters at different ranges and conditions. The mathematical models are developed for Torque and Fuel delivery of FIP. This paper also {{explains the}} optimization of control parameters using GA to study the optimum conditions for economic fuel delivery and optimum torque control...|$|E

50|$|The {{first model}} (223-0) was {{delivered}} earlier than expected, and saw introduction into service on 1 April 1994, on the Hanwa Line. Later {{in the same}} year, on September 4 it began serving the Kansai Airport Line Rapid Service as Kansai International Airport opened. The train was initially fitted with luggage <b>racks,</b> for passengers <b>travelling</b> to/from the airport. A 1 + 2 seating configuration has been adopted to allow passengers to place bulky luggage on the floor where necessary.|$|R
40|$|In modern storing {{technology}} High-Bay Warehouses are {{of great}} importance due to their large capacity by combining relatively small floor area with random access on all units, a large band-width with respect to weight and measurement of the storage good and the simplicity of integration in the logistical peripheries. The storage and retrieval operations are usually performed by automated rail-bound storage at retrieval machines, or types of manual floor-travelling fork-lifts for High-Bay Warehouses. Particularly by automated high-bay warehouse systems, {{a high degree of}} positioning accuracy is a basic requirement for sufficient reliability. The aim of this work is to investigate the essential elements required for improving the positional accuracy with reference to the various influential parameters. The influential parameters are wearout, tolerance, static and dynamic deformation of the storage and retrieval machine, as well as the tolerance and static deformations of the <b>rack</b> structure or <b>travel</b> and guide rails. Another basic parameter is the positional aberation at the centring location. To study the qualities of positioning systems, an experimental model was conceived and constructed allowing the emulation of the vibration of the wing unit of storage and retrieval machines. Theoretical calculations as well as the experimental results show that both the vibration level of the column of signle mast machines and the vertical vibrations of the lifting carriage can be simulated with adequate precision. Various arrangements of positioning systems were compared with respect to the expected qualities. One arrangement based upon a laser positional transducer was chosen, built, and investigated {{with the help of the}} developed experimental model. A high positioning accuracy of this positioning system was verified-which was almost independent of all the enumerated influential parameters. (orig.)

40|$|Corresponding author Abstract: The {{operation}} of an automobile steering gear is intermittent with low angular velocities and frequent direction reversals. For a typical Rack and Pinion Steering (RPS) gear used in light vehicles, {{the span of}} movement of the rack is limited to approximately four rotations of the pinion. For this limited span of <b>rack</b> <b>travel,</b> the torque required to rotate the pinion is tested for satisfactory functioning of the steering gear. The torque variation due to engagement and disengagement of the pinion teeth, mesh friction variation, and spring force that keeps the gears in mesh, etc., are obtained from the virtual prototype developed in Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems (ADAMS) software, where, the manufacturing errors are also incorporated. Comparisons of {{the results from the}} virtual prototype with those from laboratory tests validate the correctness of the proposed prototype in ADAMS. This prototype lends itself for the implementation of improvement concepts and performance testing...|$|E
40|$|Often called 'the {{heart of}} the engine', the fuel {{injection}} system is without any doubt {{one of the most}} important systems. It meters the fuel delivery according to engine requirements, it generates the high injection pressure required for fuel atomization, for air-fuel mixing and for combustion and it contributes to the fuel distribution in the combustion system-hence it significantly affects engine performance emissions and noise. In this Investigation optimization of control parameters used for optimum control of fuel delivered by the FIP of the Automotive engine is Analyzed. The parameters observed were fuel delivery, input current to driving motor, rpm of the pump, control <b>rack</b> <b>travel</b> and number of strokes. The fuelinjection system is the most vital component in the working of CI engine. The engine performance (power output, efficiency) is greatly dependent on the effectiveness of the fuel injection system and its parameters. The experiment is conducted on two MICO Bosch FIP of TATA Engine (TATA 1613 and TATA 609 FIP) as per DoE using three input parameters at different ranges and conditions. The mathematical models are developed for Fuel delivery of FIP using taguchi,anova regression. This paper also explains the optimization of FIP parameters using biodiesel.
