50|$|Although on-site data {{collection}} using electronic measuring equipment is common-place, many monitoring programmes also use <b>remote</b> <b>surveillance</b> and remote {{access to data}} in real time. This requires the on-site monitoring equipment {{to be connected to}} a base station via either a telemetry network, land-line, cell phone network or other telemetry system such as Meteor burst. The advantage of <b>remote</b> <b>surveillance</b> is that many data feeds can come into a single base station for storing and analysis. It also enable trigger levels or alert levels to be set for individual monitoring sites and/or parameters so that immediate action can be initiated if a trigger level is exceeded. The use of <b>remote</b> <b>surveillance</b> also allows for the installation of very discrete monitoring equipment which can often be buried, camouflaged or tethered at depth in a lake or river with only a short whip aerial protruding. Use of such equipment tends to reduce vandalism and theft when monitoring in locations easily accessible by the public.|$|E
