50|$|Each {{nanolithography}} {{technique has}} varying factors of resolution, time consumption, and cost. There are three basic methods used by nanolithography. One involves using a <b>resist</b> <b>material</b> which {{acts as a}} “mask” to cover and protect {{the areas of the}} surface that are intended to be smooth. The uncovered portions can now be etched away, with the protective material acting as a stencil. The second method involves directly carving the desired pattern. Etching may involve using a beam of quantum particles, such as electrons or light, or chemical methods such as oxidation or SAM’s (self-assembled monolayers). The third method places the desired pattern directly on the surface, producing a final product that is ultimately a few nanometers thicker than the original surface. In order to visualize the surface to be fabricated, the surface must be visualized by a nano-resolution microscope, which include the scanning probe microscope (SPM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM). Both microscopes can also be engaged in processing the final product.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{mechanisms}} for producing structures in resist materials is, in general, bond scissioning in positive resists such as PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), or cross-linking in negative resists such as SU-8. In positive resists the regions damaged by protons are removed by chemical development to produce structures, whereas in negative resists the development procedures remove the undamaged resist leaving the cross-linked structures behind. In e-beam writing, {{the primary and}} secondary electrons create the scissioning or cross-linking, whereas in p-beam writing the damage is caused by short range proton-induced secondary electrons. The proton fluence required for exposure varies from 30-150 nCmm−2 depending on the <b>resist</b> <b>material,</b> and is around 80-100 times less than that required by e-beam writing. Remark: The unit of the fluence in proton beam writing is usually given in [...] "charge/area". It can be converted into [...] "particles/area" [...] by dividing [...] "charge/area" [...] by the charge of a proton, Q = 1,602·10−19C.|$|E
50|$|Scientists around Daniel Rugar and John Mamin at the IBM {{research}} laboratories in Almaden {{have been}} the pioneers in using heated AFM (atomic force microscope) probes for the modification of surfaces. In 1992, they used microsecond laser pulses to heat AFM tips to write indents as small as 150 nm into the polymer PMMA at rates of 100 kHz. In the following years, they developed cantilevers with resonance frequencies above 4 MHz and integrated resistive heaters and piezoresistive sensors for writing and reading of data. This thermo-mechanical data storage concept {{formed the basis of}} the Millipede project which was initialized by Peter Vettiger and Gerd Binnig at the IBM Research laboratories Zurich in 1995. It was an example of a memory storage device with a large array of parallel probes, which was however never commercialized due to growing competition from non-volatile memory such as flash memory. The storage medium of the Millipede memory consisted of polymers with shape memory functionality, like e.g. cross-linked polystyrene, in order to allow to write data indents by plastic deformation and erasing of the data again by heating. However, evaporation instead of plastic deformation was necessary for nanolithography applications to be able to create any pattern in the resist. Such local evaporation of resist induced by a heated tip could achieved for several materials like Pentaerythritol tetranitrate, cross-linked polycarbonates, and Diels-Alder polymers. Significant progress in the choice of <b>resist</b> <b>material</b> was made in 2010 at IBM Research in Zurich, leading to high resolution and precise 3D-relief patterning {{with the use of the}} self-amplified depolymerization polymer polyphthalaldehyde (PPA) and molecular glasses as resist, where the polymer decomposes into volatile monomers upon heating with the tip without the application of mechanical force and without pile-up or residues of the resist.|$|E

To obtain <b>resist</b> <b>materials</b> with high sensitivity and high contrast, the authors ynthesized four 1 -(3 H) -isobenzofuranone derivatives as novel disso-lution inhibitors, which ontain a tert-butexycarbonyl (t-Boc) group and a lactone ring. The t-Bec group of these dissolu-tion inhibitors was effectively decomposed by an acid catalyzed thermal reaction. In addition to this decomposition, the lactone ring of the decomposed product was spontaneously cleft in an aqueous base to generate carboxylic acid. Among these synthesized substances, only the t-Boc derivative of o-cresolphthalein, named CP-TBOC, showed an excellent solu-bility in 1 -acetoxy- 2 -ethoxyethane.

Moore's law states {{that the number of}} transistors per integrated circuit will double every four years. In order to successfully continue this trend of miniaturizing feature sizes, new, smaller sized patterning materials must be studied. Small molecule photoresists are being developed for high resolution patterning. Low molecular weight amorphous materials, or molecular glasses (MGs), have emerged as alternatives to polymeric <b>resist</b> <b>materials.</b> They combine the benefits of small molecular size with the favorable aspects of polymers, such as a high glass transition temperature (Tg) and the ability to form thin films. Inorganic-based nanoparticles are currently being explored as next generation photoresists. These materials are similar in architecture to MGs, but are comprised of an inorganic core that provides excellent thermal stability and resistance to plasma etching. This research focuses on the synthesis and characterization both MG and nanoparticle <b>resist</b> <b>materials</b> for high resolution patterning. The materials studied are designed for use with Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV-L), using a wavelength of 13. 5 nm.

40|$|Presently {{there are}} several {{approaches}} to achieving a high throughput, production worthy X-ray lithography system. One approach utilizes a conventional X-ray source with fast X-ray <b>resist</b> <b>materials</b> to expose a large diameter wafer (typically 3 " to 4 " in one step). Another approach also utilizes a conventional X-ray source (or perhaps a plasma X-ray source) and fast X-ray <b>resist</b> <b>materials</b> to expose in a step and repeat fashion a large diameter wafer (e. g., < 5 "). A third approach utilizes a storage ring source of X-ray radiation in combination with conventional <b>resist</b> <b>materials</b> (i. e., AZ, PMMA, etc.) to expose large diameter wafers in a step and repeat fashion. In particular, single step exposure systems are limited to small diameter wafers due to registration errors which are ameliorated in step and repeat systems.

40|$|Strong {{candidate}} lithography for {{the mass}} production of devices at the 32 nm technology node and beyond is extreme ultra violet lithography (EUVL). The mask used in EUVL is {{a complex set of}} layers. The material composition and thickness of each layer should be considered explicitly in an attempt to model the deposited energy in the resist film during fabrication of mask features using electron-beam lithography. Targeting to sub- 32 nm technology even with the reduction by 4 of the mask features on the wafer level, lithography should consider accurate fabrication features on the mask level of the order of 50 nm. Therefore, detailed simulation of the electron-beam fabrication process, as well as the resist dissolution mechanism and etching is demanding. In this work an attempt is initiated targeting in combining two simulation techniques i. e., the electron-beam simulation, with the stochastic lithography simulation, in a common simulation platform.

On one hand, next-generation lithography (NGL) technologies which utilize extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and the state-of-art 193 nm immmersion and double patterning lithography have emerged as the promising candidates to meet the resolution requirements of the microelectronic industry roadmap. On the other hand, the development and advanced characterization of novel <b>resist</b> <b>materials</b> with the required critical imaging properties, such as high resolution, high sensitivity, and low line edge roughness (LER), is also indispensable. In conventional multi-component chemically amplified resist (CAR) system, the inherent incompatibility between small molecule photoacid generator (PAG) and the bulky polymer resin can lead to PAG phase separation, PAG aggregation, non-uniform PAG and acid distribution, as well as uncontrolled acid migration during the post-exposure baking (PEB) processes in the resist film. These problems ultimately create the tri-lateral tradeoff between achieving the desired lithography characteristics. Novel <b>resist</b> <b>materials</b> which can relief this constraint are essential and have {{become one of the most}} challenging issues for the implementation NGL technologies. This thesis work focuses on the development and characterization of novel <b>resist</b> <b>materials</b> for NGL technologies. In the first part of the thesis work, advanced characterization techniques for studying resist fundamental properties and lithographic performance are developed and demonstrated. These techniques provide efficient and precise evaluations of PAG acid generation, acid diffusivity, and intrinsic resolution and LER of <b>resist</b> <b>materials.</b> The applicability of these techniques to the study of resist structure-function relationships are also evaluated and discussed.
