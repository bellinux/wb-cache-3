40|$|In {{curved beams}} of {{thin-walled}} construction secondary stresses such as crushing {{of the web}} and curling of the flanges occur due to the initial curvature of the beam. The presence of these stresses becomes more significant when advanced composite materials are used. Two parameters, accounting for material stiffness and geometric effects of the beam structure, characterize the flange stress redistribution. Using a simple `strength of materials'-based analytical solution for flange curling and web crushing, the design and optimization of curved composite I- and box beams under bending were examined. The ply orientations and stacking sequence of the flange {{have been found to}} drastically affect the nature of these stress redistributions and consequently the overall load carrying capability of the beam. Overall frame optimization was explored. To maximize load carrying capability, for a given amount of material, of a curved beam structure under bending in its own plane, the overall bending stiffness should be maximized and flange curling minimized. For composite beams, this is most effectively accomplished by minimizing web thickness and placing a large percentage of flange fibers perpendicular to the web. For the box beam, a low web bending stiffness seems beneficial in <b>reducing</b> <b>flange</b> curling moments. While web crushing needs to be considered, the curling of the flanges and its effect on the web is more critical...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Moment {{resistant}} steel {{connections are}} widely used in steel structures and {{play a significant role}} in reliability of structures, especially in earthquake-prone regions. After the Northridge earthquake, the invention of Reduced Beam Section (RBS) connections was a turning point in the design of the moment-resistant steel connections. In the present study, the seismic behavior of the RBS connections with <b>reduced</b> <b>flange</b> width as well as the AW- RBS connections with reduced web section in the double section beams are investigated. The results of a numerical study conducted using ABQUS finite element modeling software to investigate the ductility, energy absorption and plastic behavior of the RBS joints under cyclic loads are presented. Results showed promising performance with regards to energy absorbance and ductility for the AW-RBS connections...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using <b>reduced</b> <b>flange</b> plates (RFPs) or rib plates for seismic response of steel moment connections was investigated through cyclic testing of six full-scale specimens. The first scheme utilized RFPs {{to connect the}} beam flanges to the column, without any direct connection of the beam flange to the column. Plastic hinges were forced to form in the RFPs instead of the steel beam due to strong beam-weak RFPs, so the weakened moment connection eliminated buckling of the beam and reduced cost of repairing after earthquakes. The second scheme was to strengthen a connection, which was removed from an existing 33 -story steel building, by welding rib plates between the column face and inner side of the beam flanges. Test results of the weakened connections showed that (1) the connections developed beam plastic moment and reach more than an interstory drift of 4 % without strength degradation, (2) the RFP was effective in dissipating energy before buckling, and (3) no buckling of the beam was observed. Test results of the strengthened connection showed that the rib plates significantly <b>reduced</b> the beam <b>flange</b> strain by 75 % compared to a non-retrofitted steel moment connection. Both types of connection specimens were modeled using the non-linear finite element computer program ABAQUS to perform a correlation study...|$|R

40|$|Steering bogies and {{actively}} steered bogies {{are subjected to}} increasing interest. Self-steering bogies {{have been used in}} large numbers of hauling locomotives primarily in the USA to <b>reduce</b> <b>flange</b> wear and improve adhesion. However, the steering performance of self-steering bogies is reported to deteriorate under traction. This article compares several bogie types and proposes a new design of steering bogie featuring forced steering combined with control of the bogie yaw movement or actuated yaw forced steered bogie (AY-FS). The bogie stability of a force steered bogie is improved by yaw actuation using a negative derivative control of the bogie yaw misalignment. An additional benefit of the bogie design is that actuators and control sensors for the AY-FS bogie can be mounted on the vehicle body rather than on the bogie frame. The article presents simulation results for a yaw actuated force steered bogie under traction curving conditions. The AY-FS bogie is compared with rigid and force steered bogies and is shown to give superior performance at high traction adhesion levels during curving. The curving performance improvements achieved depend on the curvature, lateral forces on the vehicle, the traction load, and the rail friction. The greatest curving performance advantages occur in tighter curvatures with high traction loads and low rail friction and with high lateral forces to the inside rail such as would result from coupler loads on pulling locomotives...|$|R

40|$|Amtrak's Northeast {{corridor}} (NEC), with 150 mph Acela {{passenger trains}} operating on tracks shared with much slower and heavier freight trains, places unique {{demands on the}} wheel/rail system. The traffic mix runs the gamut between slow moving heavy axle load trains operating at considerable under-balanced elevations and high speed trains running at up to 7 inches of cant deficiency over an alignment far more curved than any other high speed corridor around the world. This poses a particularly challenging maintenance environment in which to operate a high-speed service. Among its many efforts to facilitate higher speeds and more efficient services on passenger lines, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has initiated a landmark project to help Amtrak engineer the wheel/rail interaction on the NEC for improved safety, ride quality and lower maintenance costs. This paper reports on the improved curved-rail profiles that {{have been designed to}} maximize the effectiveness of limited rail grinding resources during the 2002 grinding cycle. It reports on an alternate wheel profile that will soon be tested for its ability to <b>reduce</b> <b>flange</b> wear on the high-speed Acela vehicles and for its impact on stability, wheel climb, wear and contact fatigue.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{earthquakes}} {{have shown}} that steel moment frame (SMF) with weld connections are so brittle. According to the studies conducted, great damages are due to the cracking of the weld between the beam flange and the column face and inducing concentrated stresses in this area.

Given the enormous impact of seismic behavior and ductility of the panel zone, RBS moves plastic hinge formation at an appropriate distance from column face.

Redescription of the skull of Nemegtosaurus identifies key features that link it and its closely related counterpartQuaesitosaurus to titanosaur sauropods. These include a posterolaterally orientated quadrate fossa, ‚Äòrocker‚Äô-like palatobasal contact, pterygoid with <b>reduced</b> quadrate <b>flange</b> and a novel basisphenoid‚Äìquadrate contact. Other features are exclusive to Nemegtosaurus and Quaesitosaurus, such as the presence of a symphyseal eminence on the external aspect of the premaxillae, a highly vascularised tooth bearing portion of the maxilla, an enclosed ‚Äòmaxillary canal‚Äô, orbital ornamentation on the postorbital, prefrontal and frontal, exclusion of the squamosal from the supratemporal fenestra and dentary teeth smaller in diameter than premaxillary and maxillary teeth.

50|$|The bogie {{comprises}} a {{carrying axle}} {{connected to a}} coupled axle via a shaft or lever. In straight running, any radial movement of the carrying axle results in a sideways movement of the coupled axle in the opposite direction. However, the carrying axle is centred by means of two heavy duty springs just behind it. In addition the pivot pin may be allowed to move sideways, but again is held centrally by heavy springs. When travelling round a curve, the carrying axle swings to one side causing the coupled axle to move sideways in the opposite direction.

Continuing the research, this study is aimed to check the performance of steel moment resisting frames using RBS in their two major orthogonal axes. In order to reduce the excesive interstory drift, structures use kingcross section.

40|$|The upper Campanian of the American Southwest has {{produced}} dinosaurs that are unknown {{from the northern}} Great Plains and vice versa. This {{has led to the}} idea that North America's Campanian dinosaur fauna was characterized by high levels of endemism and distinct faunal provinces. Here, two horned dinosaurs known from the Southwest, Pentaceratops and Kosmoceratops, are described from southern Canada. Pentaceratops aquilonius sp. nov. is represented by two frill fragments from the uppermost Dinosaur Park Formation near Manyberries, southeast Alberta. Features shared with Pentaceratops include large, triangular epiparietals, an M-shaped parietal posterior bar, and an epiparietal P 1 that curls up and twists laterally. The Manyberries specimens differ from Pentaceratops sternbergii and Utahceratops gettyi in that the posterior bar is broader, emargination is weakly developed, and P 1 is directed dorsally, rather than anteriorly. Phylogenetic analysis places P. aquilonius as sister to a clade comprising P. sternbergii and Utahceratops. Kosmoceratops is documented by a partial skull from Dinosaur Provincial Park. Previously referred to Chasmosaurus, the skull exhibits derived features inconsistent with this referral, including a <b>reduced</b> septal <b>flange,</b> a caudally inclined narial strut, a triangular narial process, a reduced frontal fontanelle, a weakly hooked rostral, and a narrow, caudally inclined internal naris. Phylogenetic analysis recovers the animal as sister to Kosmoceratops richardsoni, but differences {{in the shape of the}} naris and nasal horn suggest that it likely represents a distinct species. The presence of Pentaceratops and Kosmoceratops in Canada argues against the idea of distinct northern and southern faunal provinces, but the fact that they differ from their southern relatives confirms that endemism was high in the Campanian. The ability of dinosaur lineages to disperse long distances across North America suggests that dinosaur distribution was not constrained by geographic barriers, climate, or flora. Instead, dinosaur endemism may result from competitive exclusion of immigrants by established populations adapted to local environmental conditions...|$|R
