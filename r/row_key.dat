5000|$|Bigtable maps two {{arbitrary}} string values (<b>row</b> <b>key</b> and column key) and timestamp (hence three-dimensional mapping) into {{an associated}} arbitrary byte array. It {{is not a}} relational database and can be better defined as a sparse, distributed multi-dimensional sorted map. Bigtable is designed to scale into the petabyte range across [...] "hundreds or thousands of machines, {{and to make it}} easy to add more machines to the system and automatically start taking advantage of those resources without any reconfiguration".|$|E
5000|$|A column family (called [...] "table" [...] since CQL 3) {{resembles a}} table in an RDBMS. Column {{families}} contain rows and columns. Each row is uniquely identified by a <b>row</b> <b>key.</b> Each row has multiple columns, {{each of which has}} a name, value, and a timestamp. Unlike {{a table in}} an RDBMS, different rows in the same column family do not have to share the same set of columns, and a column may be added to one or multiple rows at any time.|$|E

30|$|Create two HTables In this design, each RDB table {{would be}} added to a {{separate}} HTable with a single column family. The first HTable contains {{the source of the}} relationship; a second column family is added that contains the referenced <b>Row</b> <b>Keys</b> from the second HTable.|$|R
5000|$|The Commodore 128 had a [...] key in {{the second}} block of top <b>row</b> <b>keys.</b> Amiga {{keyboards}} had a [...] key, labelled as such, above the arrow keys on the keyboard, and next to a [...] key (where the [...] cluster is on a standard PC keyboard).|$|R
30|$|The {{selection}} of the <b>row</b> <b>key</b> in an HTable {{is one of the}} most critical activities for a successful schema design [7]. A <b>row</b> <b>key</b> is used to fetch data, which means that when a <b>row</b> <b>key</b> is carefully selected, its rows are sorted in a way that regroups the data to be accessed together, ensuring a more efficient query [7]. A badly chosen <b>row</b> <b>key</b> could spread the data across the HTable and make fetching of the data time consuming and result in poor performance. Therefore, the {{selection of}} a <b>row</b> <b>key</b> is always based on the context of the table, as opposed to the relational model, where the primary key plays this important role. Typically, the primary key is unique in a table but this does not usually allow for grouping of data. Grouping can be performed using SQL statements such as ORDER BY on data contained in other columns (e.g. SELECT * FROM BOOKS ORDER BY AUTHORS).|$|E

30|$|Most column-family {{stores are}} derived from Google Bigtable [20], in which the data are stored in a column-oriented way. In Bigtable, the dataset {{consists}} of several rows, {{each of which is}} addressed by a unique <b>row</b> <b>key,</b> also known as a primary key. Each row is composed of a set of column families, and different rows can have different column families. Similarly to key-value stores, the <b>row</b> <b>key</b> resembles the key, and the set of column families resembles the value represented by the <b>row</b> <b>key.</b> However, each column family further acts as a key for the one or more columns that it holds, where each column consists of a name-value pair. Hadoop HBase [37] directly implements the Google Bigtable concepts, whereas Amazon SimpleDB [27] and DynamoDB [28] have a different data model than Bigtable. SimpleDB and DymanoDB contain only a set of column name-value pairs in each row, without having column families. Cassandra [19], on the other hand, provides the additional functionality of super-columns, which are formed by grouping various columns together.|$|E

30|$|Create two HTables The third {{possible}} {{design pattern}} {{is to create}} two HTables where each HTable contains one column family and each column family contains all RDB columns. Finally, insert the <b>row</b> <b>key</b> of each HTable into both HTables.|$|E
30|$|A RDB Schema is {{composed}} of tables, columns and relationships between the tables: one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many. Such relationships do not exist in an HBase schema [4]. The HBase terminology refers to a <b>row</b> <b>key,</b> a column and a column family. To facilitate the understanding of this paper, the term “HTable” will refer to an HBase Table and the term “Table” will refer to any relational database table.|$|E

30|$|Lee et al. [1] {{proposed}} an automatic Sql-to-NoSQL schema transformation using MySQL and HBase as an example. The main {{objective of the}} proposed solution was to avoid cross-table queries. In this proposal, all tables that have a relationship were transformed into a single HBase table. This approach breaks down {{the complexity of the}} conversion {{but it is hard to}} imagine a large and complex relational database (RDB) fitting into a single HBase table without affecting its performance. HBase is, after all, a ‘query first’ type of schema design database. Another conversion proposal by Serrano et al. [2] proposed a conversion methodology in four steps. First, convert every one-to-one and one-to-many relationship into a single merged table in HBase. Second, apply a recursive method to merge neighboring tables. Third, design a <b>row</b> <b>key,</b> and fourth, create views for different access patterns needed. In this proposal, an additional step is performed that consisted in the extraction of access patterns from query logs. This last step should have been considered as a fifth step since access pattern extraction is a key step in the conversion process. To the best of our knowledge, there is no set of conversion rules to convert between an existing RDB and HBase at this time and thus, the main contribution of this paper is to present a set of conversion rules that can be used for any conversion of an existing RDB into HBase.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{plant species}} on a {{simulated}} pipeline corridor near Tulita (Fort Norman), Northwest Territories were studied {{prior to and}} for three years after an experimental point-spill of 3273 L (20 imperial barrels) of crude oil. Two distinct environments were examined: a cleared right-of-way (ROW) and a simulated pipeline trench. Each environment was subdivided {{on the basis of}} oil concentration into heavily oiled, lightly oiled, and unoiled sections. Total plant cover on the heavily oiled ROW declined by 73 % in the first growing season; however, significant recovery took place in subsequent years. All other oiled environments had significant increases in total plant cover, but not until at least the second year after the spill. Of the 34 taxa identified, 13 declined significantly in abundance by the third growing season after the oil spill, mainly on the heavily oiled ROW. By the third post-spill growing season, mosses, Carex spp., Eriophorum spp., and agronomic grasses (Alopecurus arundinacea, Phleum pratense, Poa glauca and P. pratensis) had increased in abundance on at least one type of oiled substrate. However, the agronomic grasses, species sown on the Norman Wells pipeline, also declined significantly on the heavily oiled Trench. In contrast, the native grass Arctagrostis latifolia declined only on the heavily oiled <b>ROW.</b> <b>Key</b> words: oil spill, subarctic, plant species, vegetation, disturbance, revegetation, plant recovery, oil pipeline RÉSUMÉ.
