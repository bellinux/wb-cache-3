However, many HIV infected clients are missing the opportunities. This study intends to identify predictors <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> PIHT among clients visiting adult outpatient departments (OPDs) in Jimma town. Methods: An unmatched case control study was conducted among 296 clients: 149 cases refusing HIV testing and 147 controls accepting HIV testing. The study recruited clients from OPDs of four public health facilities between March 6 and April 8, 2011 using consecutive sampling. The study instrument was adapted mainly considering health belief model (HBM). Jimma University ethical committee reviewed the study protocol. Data were collected by face-to-face interview and analyzed using SPSS Statistics (IBM Corporation, Somers, NY) software, version 16. 0. Data were subjected to factor and reliability analysis. For prediction analysis, the study used logistic regression and odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). To see the effects among HBM constructs, the study used standardized beta (&beta;) coefficients at P &lt; 0. 05. Results: The study findings showed adjusted protective effects on <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> PIHT for <b>residence</b> outside study town [adjusted OR (AOR) (95 % CI) = 0. 41 (0. 22 &ndash; 0. 79) ] and higher scores of perceived benefit of early testing [AOR (95 % CI) ] = 0. 86 (0. 69 &ndash; 0. 99) ], self efficacy to live with HIV [AOR (95 % CI) = 0. 79 (0. 66 &ndash; 0. 93) ], nondisclosure agreement [AOR (95 % CI) = 0. 74 (0. 58 &ndash; 0. 93) ], perceived explicitness of opt-out right during initiation [AOR (95 % CI) = 0. 74 (0. 56 &ndash; 0. 98) ] and clients&rsquo; perceptions of selective initiation of HIV suspected [AOR (95 % CI) = 0. 54 (0. 41 &ndash; 0. 73) ]. On the other hand, report of recent testing [AOR (95 % CI) = 3. 82 (1. 71 &ndash; 8. 55) ] and perceived unpreparedness for testing [AOR (95 % CI) = 1. 86 (1. 57 &ndash; 2. 21) ] aggravated <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> PIHT. Exposure to cues to testing significantly reduced perceived barriers [&beta; (P) = &ndash; 0. 05 (0. 037) ]. Conclusion: Clients&rsquo; perceived barriers: feeling of unpreparedness for testing strongly aggravated <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> test. Enhanced self-efficacy to live with HIV and presence of cues to HIV testing would reduce unpreparedness and protect from refusing PIHT. Keywords: HIV testing, provider-initiated, acceptanc...|$|R
40|$|Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are all {{examples}} of European {{countries that have}} implemented civic integration programs. The diffusion of civic integration courses, requirements and tests for newcomers reveals a convergent trend in immigration integration policies. This kind of policy requires that newcomers meet integration requirements in order to enter, reside, reunite with their families, enjoy social benefits and naturalize in the host country (Kostakopoulou 2010). Migrants are expected to attend language and citizenship courses and/or to take integration tests after entering in the host country (since 2006 the Netherlands, pioneers in the field, have implemented tests to be taken before and in the home country of the migrants). The immigrant’s failure or non-completion of the program tends to be sanctioned by <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> a <b>residence</b> permit, financial penalties, a loss of social benefits, etc. The content and structure of these programs vary widely in terms of scope, goals, target groups and institutional actors involved. This diversity mainly derives from the different historical backgrounds, societal models, as well as patterns and traditions of migration flows. However, beyond the factual analysis {{of the content of}} civic integration programs, my purpose is to analyze some crucial questions raised by such policies through the lens of political theory. It is a good opportunity to question the conceptual frame underpinning the contemporary civic integration discourses. This paper is divided into three parts. In the first section, I discuss the very notion of integration and its implications. Next, the second section is devoted to an analysis of the consequences of the binding character of such programs, and the ways to monitor the success of a migrant after completing a civic integration program. Finally, in the third section I question the real target of such policies: are they aimed at inclusion or exclusion? In conclusion, this paper aims at analyzing the implications of the deep changes experienced by European integration policies. Beyond the understanding of these issues, a broader reflection on the concepts of citizenship, immigration, integration and boundaries is proposed...|$|R
