For example, the 2007 change to DST rules in North America <b>required</b> <b>that</b> many computer systems be upgraded, {{with the greatest}} impact on e-mail and calendar programs. The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate information technologists.|$|E

5|$|Although {{named the}} Jersey Act by a {{critical}} foreign press, after Lord Jersey, the new regulation {{did not have}} the force of law as it was promulgated by the registration authorities of the Thoroughbred horse, not by the United Kingdom government. Nor was it promulgated by the Jockey Club, which had no authority over registration, only over racing matters. The regulation <b>required</b> <b>that</b> any horse registered in the General Stud Book trace in every line to a horse that had already been registered in the General Stud Book, effectively excluding most American-bred Thoroughbreds.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{challenge}} {{that came up}} in production was who Monk's new psychiatrist would be. Several ideas included a woman, someone too strict or too nice, someone driven crazy by Monk's compulsions, and even someone who would give Monk scream therapy. The eventual decision came from writer Jonathan Collier, who suggested a one-armed psychiatrist. Shalhoub liked the idea, but <b>required</b> <b>that</b> they recruit an actual one-armed actor to play Dr. Sorenson. The Screen Actors Guild actually had several actors waiting to audition, and the part was given to Rick Curry.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Julius Caesar in 54BC, regular legionary units were {{supplemented}} by exploratores, a body of scouts, and speculatores, spies who infiltrated enemy camps. Due {{to the demands of}} the civil war, the extraordinary measure of recruiting legions from non-citizens was taken by Caesar in Transalpine Gaul (Latin: Gallia Transalpina), by Brutus in Macedonia, and by Pompey in Pharsalus. This irregular and extraordinary recruitment was not, however, typical of recruitment during this period, and Roman law still officially <b>required</b> <b>that</b> legions were recruited from Roman citizens only.|$|E

The bank {{therefore}} <b>required</b> <b>that</b> the entire sales price of Hamar stadion {{be transferred to}} BG, even though NOK50 million {{was to go to}} the construction of Børstad Idrettspark (BIP). Therefore, Hamar Municipality decided to finance BIP to secure sufficient funding for Briskeby, essentially subsidizing Briskeby with a further NOK50 million. In 2007, BG paid NOK3.4 million in compensation to Ham-Kam for lost ticket sales during the construction time and for the club house, which would be demolished.|$|E
5|$|Filming was {{scheduled}} to start in December 1983, but was postponed for six months to accommodate Modine's shooting schedule for Mrs. Soffel (1984). Principal photography began in Philadelphia on May 15, 1984, with a budget of $12 million. The script <b>required</b> <b>that</b> a total of 24 locations be used for filming in Philadelphia and Santa Clara, California. Animal trainer Gary Gero employed the use of 80 different canaries for various scenes in the film, as well as pigeons, a hornbill, a cat, eighteen dogs and a seagull.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Germany {{simply had}} no battleships. The Armistice with Germany <b>required</b> <b>that</b> {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet be {{disarmed}} and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in Scapa Flow, Scotland. The Treaty of Versailles specified that the ships should be {{handed over to the}} British. Instead, most of them were scuttled by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any capital ships.|$|E

5|$|He was {{appointed}} Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669 on Barrow's recommendation. During that time, any Fellow {{of a college}} at Cambridge or Oxford was required to take holy orders and become an ordained Anglican priest. However, {{the terms of the}} Lucasian professorship <b>required</b> <b>that</b> the holder not be active in the church (presumably so as to have more time for science). Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.|$|E
5|$|Howard went to Chicago Vocational Career Academy, {{where he}} went on to play three seasons of varsity basketball. Vocational had an {{unheated}} gym and no locker rooms, which <b>required</b> <b>that</b> the team dress for games in a history classroom. Nonetheless, Howard went on to be named a 1991 All-American basketball player by Parade magazine and won McDonald's All American honors. He was also chosen for the National Honor Society and served as Vocational's homecoming king. During recruiting visits by college coaches such as Illinois' Lou Henson, DePaul's Joey Meyer and Michigan's Steve Fisher, Jannie Mae Howard did most of the questioning.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{a recall}} vote was held asking if 2003 inductee Chris Benoit, who {{killed his wife}} and son before {{committing}} suicide in June 2007, should remain in the hall. To have Benoit removed, Meltzer <b>required</b> <b>that</b> 60% of voters must agree with the proposal. Although the majority voted for Benoit's removal, they only represented 53.6% of the votes, falling short of the number required. Benoit remains on the list of inductees.|$|E
5000|$|In game theory, rationalizability is a {{solution}} concept. The general idea is to provide the weakest constraints on players while still <b>requiring</b> <b>that</b> players are rational and this rationality is common knowledge among the players. It is more permissive than Nash equilibrium. Both <b>require</b> <b>that</b> players respond optimally to some belief about their opponents' actions, but Nash equilibrium <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> these beliefs be correct while rationalizability does not. Rationalizability was first defined, independently, by Bernheim (1984) and Pearce (1984).|$|R

The clause may be general, <b>requiring</b> <b>that</b> any case arising from the contract be filed within a specific state or country, or it may <b>require</b> <b>that</b> a case be filed in a specific court. For example, a choice of forum clause may <b>require</b> <b>that</b> a case be filed in the U.S. State of California, or it may <b>require</b> more specifically <b>that</b> the case be filed in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County.|$|R

5|$|In August 1957, the US assented to {{a two-year}} testing {{moratorium}} {{proposed by the}} Soviet Union, but <b>required</b> <b>that</b> it be linked to restrictions on the production of fissionable material with military uses, a condition that the Soviet Union rejected. While Eisenhower insisted on linking a test ban to a broader disarmament effort (e.g., the production cut-off), Moscow insisted on independent consideration of a test ban.|$|E
5|$|In a sense, Rule 184 solves this problem, as follows. if Rule 184 is run on {{a finite}} set of cells with {{periodic}} boundary conditions, with an unequal number of 0s and 1s, then each cell will eventually see two consecutive states of the majority value infinitely often, but will see two consecutive states of the minority value only finitely many times. The majority problem cannot be solved perfectly if it is <b>required</b> <b>that</b> all cells eventually stabilize to the majority state but the Rule 184 solution avoids this impossibility result by relaxing the criterion by which the automaton recognizes a majority.|$|E
