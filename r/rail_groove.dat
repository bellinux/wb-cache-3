5000|$|A grooved <b>rail,</b> <b>groove</b> rail, or girder rail is {{a special}} rail with a groove {{designed}} for tramway or railway track in pavement or grassed surfaces (grassed track or track in a lawn). This was invented in 1852 by Alphonse Loubat, a French inventor who developed improvements in tram and rail equipment, and helped develop tram lines in New York City and Paris.|$|E
50|$|Where a rail is laid in a Road surface (pavement) {{or within}} grassed surfaces, {{there has to}} be {{accommodation}} for the flange. This is provided by a slot called the flangeway. The rail is then known as grooved <b>rail,</b> <b>groove</b> rail, or girder rail. The flangeway has the railhead {{on one side and the}} guard on the other. The guard carries no weight, but may act as a checkrail.|$|E
5000|$|A {{longitudinal}} channel {{formed in}} a hot rolled rail profile such as a <b>grooved</b> <b>rail.</b> This <b>groove</b> is for the flange on a train wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Two lorries called [...] {{travel the}} tramway network each day, {{to get rid}} of foreign objects in the <b>rail</b> <b>grooves.</b> If there is a fault on the rolling stock or the fixed infrastructure, the CTS has a fleet of road-rail vehicles, such as tractors, a Unimog and several bulldozers.|$|R
25|$|Steam trams {{relied upon}} their weight and {{adhesion}} for propulsion {{and as the}} town streets were badly paved, dirt, stones, manure and water got into the <b>rail</b> <b>grooves.</b> Water boys and track cleaners were employed {{to clean out the}} <b>rail</b> <b>grooves</b> with long iron bars, which they dragged along the rails, it being essential to ensure the wheel flanges ran fully in the grooves, to allow the wheel tread to grip the track. The specification of performance was strict, the vehicle had to be silent, had to emit no smoke and was required to have no exposed parts which could provide a safety hazard to pedestrians and horses. In Nottingham, only one steam tram was operated and being considerably heavier than a horse-drawn car, it, no doubt, caused considerable damage to the track.|$|R
50|$|Tramway {{track is}} used on tramways or light <b>rail</b> operations. <b>Grooved</b> <b>rails</b> (or girder rails) are often used to provide a {{protective}} flangeway in the trackwork in city streets. Like standard rail tracks, tram tracks consist of two parallel steel rails.|$|R
50|$|Home to a {{total of}} 8 {{providing}} the reversing switch and tram rails, there are 74 points. Two types of rail are used in the project. S49 ray fungus, supports 13 492 meters of the <b>rail</b> line. Rİ60 <b>grooved</b> <b>rail</b> rail line covers 2203 meters.|$|R
5000|$|City trams {{often use}} tight curves - {{sometimes}} with a radius of {{much less than}} about 20 m, and canting may be impossible because the surface is shared with road vehicles or pedestrian zones or sidewalks, so the track often has to be flush with the road surface or pavement. In sharp curves, the <b>rail</b> <b>grooves</b> are sometimes made very shallow, which causes the outer wheel to temporarily ride up onto the edge of its flange. This increases the wheel diameter and the curve can be taken more easily. In extreme cases, the <b>rail</b> has a <b>groove</b> so that {{the rim of the}} flange can take most of the weight, the [...] "out-board" [...] tire (on the outer radius of the outer rail) acting as no more than a vertical plate.|$|R

50|$|In 1913, the Bad Durkheim-Ludwigshafen-Oggersheim railway {{was opened}} by Rhein-Haardt Bahn GmbH, which begins {{on the station}} forecourt.

5000|$|<b>Grooved</b> <b>rail</b> {{was invented}} in 1852 by Alphonse Loubat, a French {{inventor}} who developed improvements in tram and rail equipment, and helped develop tram lines in New York City and Paris. The invention of <b>grooved</b> <b>rail</b> enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get their wheels caught in the groove. The grooves may become filled with gravel and dirt (particularly if infrequently used or {{after a period of}} idleness) and need clearing from time to time, this being done by a [...] "scrubber" [...] tram. Failure to clear the grooves can lead to a bumpy ride for the passengers, damage to either wheel or rail and possibly derailing.|$|R
5000|$|In North America {{the groove}} {{would have to}} be a minimum of 2+1/8 in wide and by extension, the maximum {{distance}} between the inside faces of the guard flanges of the <b>grooved</b> <b>rails</b> can be no more than 52+1/4 in, see below.|$|R
50|$|Another {{characteristic}} of the Lviv tram is the <b>grooved</b> <b>rail</b> that is used. It {{is one of a}} few cities of the former Soviet Union that use this type of rail. This oddity resulted from the fact that, when the system was constructed, Lviv was part of Galicia in Austria-Hungary.|$|R
50|$|Loubat {{was born}} in Sainte-Livrade-sur-Lot. He went to New York City in 1827 where he helped develop that city's first tramway in 1832. He {{returned}} to France and developed the <b>grooved</b> <b>rail</b> in 1852, which greatly facilitated street railways and tramlines. Besides he planted wine in Brooklin and wrote on wine.|$|R
40|$|The barrel {{life of a}} solid {{armature}} rail gun is {{a critical}} issue. Arcing along the barrel pathway at the interfaces between the armature and the rails produces severe damage. The ability to protect the rails and yet provide sufficient electrical contact to sustain arc-free high-current flow is desirable. This thesis investigates the use of liquid metal as an interface material between the sliding electrical contact surfaces of the armature and the barrel rails. Experiments were conducted with the Naval Postgraduate SchoolÎ±s 4 -inch Rail Gun and liquid metal interface coatings were applied to the armatures. Results indicated that the liquid interface protects the rails and projectile surfaces for static electrical contact. Apparatus has been design to investigate sliding electrical contact between armature and rails in a controlled manner. New rails with a novel Adamy-Maier <b>grooved</b> <b>rail</b> design were fabricated to facilitate coating <b>rails.</b> Various <b>groove</b> patterns {{have been designed to}} control the current flow through the rails and across the interface surfaces, while maintaining lateral stability and interface integrity. These experiments are still in progress {{at the time of this}} writing. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R
50|$|Early rails {{were made}} of wood, cast iron or wrought iron. All modern rails are hot rolled steel with a cross section (profile) {{approximate}} to an I-beam, but asymmetric about a horizontal axis (however see <b>grooved</b> <b>rail</b> below). The head is profiled to resist wear and to give a good ride, and the foot profiled to suit the fixing system.|$|R

50|$|In 1925, the {{construction}} company Langfelder & Sohn was commissioned to replace all turntables by switches and to lay <b>grooved</b> <b>rails</b> at the intersections {{with the local}} tramway. Furthermore, four battery locomotives were bought from AEG, which were still operational in modified form until 2011. The railway was also equipped with new flat waggons with a handbrake on one side.|$|R
500|$|In 1860 a horse-drawn tramway {{had been}} built by Charles Burn, an Englishman, in Switzerland between Geneva and Carouge, a {{distance}} of about [...] [...] This proved to be a success, and Burn planned to build more lines. In 1863 he was joined by Sharpe as a partner, but after a short time of working together the partnership was dissolved, and Sharpe continued with the project alone. By March 1864 a line from the centre of Geneva to Chêne-Bougeries, {{a distance of about}} [...] was under construction, to an innovative design. [...] The line to Carouge had two <b>grooved</b> <b>rails.</b> [...] Sharpe's line had two flat rails, with a third <b>grooved</b> <b>rail</b> between them, along which ran a wheel allowing the tram to be steered. The wheel could also be raised to permit the tram to deviate from the track to pass around obstacles, or come to the pavement. [...] This line was Sharpe's sole venture in Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|The forearm {{consists}} of MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails on all 4 sides for mounting accessories such as aiming optics. The side forearm <b>rails</b> have central <b>grooves</b> to provide routing channels for electric wiring used by pressure switch activated accessories. The forearm comes with quick detachable polymer covering panels {{that can be}} mounted to protect the rails when a side or bottom rail has no accessories mounted to it.|$|R
50|$|The first tramways had a rail {{projecting}} {{above the}} road surface, or a step {{set into the}} road, {{both of which were}} apt to catch the narrow tyres of horse-drawn carriages. The invention by Alphonse Loubat in 1852 of <b>grooved</b> <b>rail</b> enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get their wheels caught in the groove.|$|R
50|$|Tram rails can {{be placed}} on several surfaces, such as with {{standard}} rails on sleepers like railway tracks, or with <b>grooved</b> <b>rails</b> on concrete sleepers into street surfaces (pavement) for street running. Another environmentally friendly or ecologically friendly alternative is to lay tracks into grass turf surfaces; {{this is known as}} grassed track (or track in a lawn), first used in Liverpool in 1924.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} form of <b>grooved</b> <b>rail</b> is the girder guard section illustrated to the right. This rail is {{a modified}} form of flanged rail and requires a special mounting for weight transfer and gauge stabilisation. If the weight is {{carried by the}} roadway subsurface, steel ties are needed at regular intervals to maintain the gauge. Installing these means that the whole surface needs to be excavated and reinstated.|$|R
50|$|In many cases, {{these early}} forms of public {{transport}} developed out of industrial haulage routes {{or from the}} omnibus that first ran on public streets, using the newly invented iron or steel rail or 'tramway'. These were local versions of the stagecoach lines and picked up and dropped off passengers on a regular route, without {{the need to be}} pre-hired. Horsecars on tramlines were an improvement over the omnibus as the low rolling resistance of metal wheels on iron or steel <b>rails</b> (usually <b>grooved</b> from 1852 on), allowed the animals to haul a greater load for a given effort than the omnibus and gave a smoother ride. The horse-drawn streetcar combined the low cost, flexibility, and safety of animal power with the efficiency, smoothness, and all-weather capability of a railway.|$|R
50|$|The horse-drawn tram (horsecar) was {{an early}} form of public rail {{transport}} that developed out of industrial haulage routes that had long been in existence, and from the omnibus routes that first ran on public streets in the 1820s, using the newly improved iron or steel rail or 'tramway'. These were local versions of the stagecoach lines and picked up and dropped off passengers on a regular route, without {{the need to be}} pre-hired.

The horse-drawn streetcar combined the low cost, flexibility, and safety of animal power with the efficiency, smoothness, and all-weather capability of a rail right-of-way.|$|R
50|$|On {{streetcar}} (tram) systems using <b>grooved</b> <b>rails,</b> if {{the wheels}} {{on both sides}} of the car are connected by a rigid solid axle, only one switchpoint is needed to steer it onto one or the other track. The switchpoint will be on inside rail of the switch's curve route. When a streetcar enters the curve route of the switch, the wheel on the inside of the curve (the right side of the car on a right turn) is pulled into the turn, and through the axle, directs the wheel on the outside to also follow the curve. The outside wheel is supported for a short distance by its flange running in the groove.|$|R
50|$|Rural and {{suburban}} lines {{can be made}} compatible for use by several types of vehicles. For example, the narrow gauge railway used by Charleroi Metro in Belgium is ridden by trams, but the tracks are built to train track standards. Trams nonetheless run smoothly on the old NMVB tram net in Anderlues, where shallow <b>groove</b> <b>rails</b> are used. Between The Hague and Rotterdam, an old railway line was converted for RandstadRail into a route able to carry both the Rotterdam Metro, which uses vehicles built to train standards as well as The Hague trams which uses vehicles built to tram standards. The Electroliners which ran out of Chicago on the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad, and afterwards on the Norristown High Speed Line, were another example.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1860s, Priddy's Hard {{ordnance}} depot had an [...] gauge manually-propelled tramway installed {{for moving}} powder and ammunition from 'C' Magazine through the Laboratory complex. Known as the 'powder line', it {{grew into a}} single line system with spurs into all magazines, explosives stores, cartridge filling rooms, and landing sheds. It extended out on the New Powder Pier in a double line. The rails were made of delta metal, an alloy of copper and zinc, (brass) plus a little iron, as a precaution against sparks; they were <b>grooved</b> <b>rails</b> (set flush with ground level). In 1904 it had 78 trucks. In time it was largely superseded by the [...] narrow gauge line; but part continued in use inside some workshops and stores to about 1960.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main problem}} with a train on tram rails is the {{relatively}} narrow width of frog and switch gaps and channels of the <b>groove</b> <b>rails</b> designed to accommodate the narrow flanges of tram wheels [...] The wider flanges of train wheels {{increase the risk of}} derailment at these points. On routes where train carriages are driven on tram tracks (as in the past in parts of The Hague), wider grooves are required as a compromise that is practical as wide <b>grooved</b> girder <b>rail</b> is available. A larger structure gauge would also be required This was also done in Los Angeles and in Vancouver as well as elsewhere in North America. The usually or normally limited structure gauge, and tight curves, on tram tracks will also prevent trains from using tram tracks.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower section}} is built in or {{alongside}} the public road and has gradients as steep as 1 in 3.8 (26.15%). The track throughout this section is laid as <b>grooved</b> <b>rail</b> within the road surface, and the cable lies below the road surface in a conduit between the rails. The {{bottom half of}} the section is single-track, but above the passing loop it has interlaced double track. By contrast, the upper section is less steep, with a maximum gradient of 1 in 10 (10%). The track is laid on sleepers and ballast, and the cable runs between the rails as is normal for most funiculars. The track is single apart from a short double track passing loop equipped with points actuated by the flanges of the passing cars. The rails are interrupted to accommodate the cable.|$|R
50|$|At {{first the}} rails {{protruded}} above street level, causing accidents and problems for pedestrians. They were supplanted in 1852 by <b>grooved</b> <b>rails</b> or girder rails, invented by Alphonse Loubat. Loubat, inspired by Stephenson, {{built the first}} tramline in Paris, France. The 2 km line was inaugurated on 21 November 1853, {{in connection with the}} 1855 World Fair, running on a trial basis from Place de la Concorde to Pont de Sèvres and later to the village of Boulogne. The Toronto streetcar system {{is one of the few}} in North America still operating in the classic style on street trackage shared with car traffic, where streetcars stop on demand at frequent stops like buses rather than having fixed stations. Known as Red Rockets because of their colour, they have been operating since the mid-19th century - horsecar service started in 1856 and electric service in 1892.|$|R
5000|$|Tramcars {{arrived from}} Immingham Dock down the grooved double track {{southern}} slope {{of one of}} the two [...] "hills" [...] on the whole line, i.e. the bridge over the conventional Grimsby District Light Railway line near Immingham East Junction. This bridge, which was in regular, heavy road use in 2015, was known locally as [...] "tramcar bridge." [...] All cars reversed at Immingham Town, a process which took several minutes as the conductor had to unhook the rear trolley pole from the overhead wire then attach the front one, which would become the rear one on reversing. On restarting the tramcar would swing right off the public road, change from <b>grooved</b> <b>rails</b> to conventional and merge to become a single track on a reserved way running parallel to the conventional Grimsby District Light Railway line through open, marshy farmland. Tramcars running in the opposite direction followed the same procedure in reverse.|$|R
50|$|The first {{streetcar}} in America, {{developed by}} John Stephenson, began {{service in the}} year 1832. This, the New York and Harlem Railroad's Fourth Avenue Line ran along the Bowery and Fourth Avenue in New York City. These streetcars, also known as horsecars in North America, were developed from city stagecoach lines and omnibus lines that picked up and dropped off passengers on a regular route and without {{the need to be}} pre-hired. These trams were an animal railway, usually using horses and sometimes mules to haul the cars, usually two as a team. Rarely other animals were tried, including humans in emergencies. It was followed in 1835 by New Orleans, Louisiana, which is the oldest continuously operating street railway system in the world, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. At first the rails protruded above street level, causing accidents and major trouble for pedestrians. They were supplanted in 1852 by <b>grooved</b> <b>rails</b> or girder rails, invented by Alphonse Loubat.|$|R
5000|$|... "Laprade" [...] seatposts (newer) use {{a single}} {{vertical}} bolt (typically an Allen bolt) which when tightened pushes two rail-grabbing pieces together. The lower {{surface of the}} lower rail-grabbing piece is convex and grooved, matching a concave groved {{on the top of}} the seat post. The curve allows the up/down angle of the saddle to be adjusted when the bolt is loosened, and loosening also allows the rails to slide forward and back. Depending on the saddle angle, the vertical bolt is not perpendicular to the angle of the <b>rails,</b> but the <b>grooves</b> prevent the interface from slipping and adopting a completely horizontal angle. This angular adjustment mechanism is known as pivotal and is common on BMX bikes. Because the grooves are finer than the grooved discs in the sold-separately saddle clamp, sometimes Laprade-style posts are also marketed as [...] "microadjustable" [...] even though the adjustment is not continuous as with the Campagnolo style.|$|R
