50|$|Pointer editors are {{occasionally}} {{combined with}} icon editors, because computer icons and cursors share similar properties. Both contain small <b>raster</b> <b>images</b> and the <b>file</b> <b>format</b> used to store icons and static cursors in Microsoft Windows is similar.|$|R
50|$|This {{may include}} {{software}} for handling specialized graphic <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> such as Fontographer software, which {{is dedicated to}} creating and editing computer fonts. Some general image editing software has unique <b>image</b> <b>file</b> handling features as well. Vector graphic editors handle vector graphic files {{and are able to}} load PostScript files natively. Some tools enable professional photographers to use nondestructive image processing for editing digital photography without permanently changing or duplicating the original, using the Raw image format. Other special handling software includes software for capturing images such as 2D scanning software, 3D scanning software and screen-capturing, or software for specialized graphic format processing such as <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> processing and <b>file</b> <b>format</b> conversion. Some tools may reduce the file size of graphics for web performance optimization while maintaining the image quality as best as possible.|$|R
