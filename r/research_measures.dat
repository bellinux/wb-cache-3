5000|$|In their {{article in}} which they coin the term 'critical data studies,' Dalton and Thatcher also provide several {{justifications}} as to why data studies is a discipline worthy of a critical approach. Firstly, 'big data' is {{an important aspect of}} twenty-first century society, and the analysis of 'big data' allows for a deeper understanding of what is happening and for what reasons. Furthermore, big data as a technological tool and the information that it yields are not neutral, according to Dalton and Thatcher, making it worthy of critical analysis in order to identify and address its biases. Building off this idea, another justification for a critical approach is that the relationship between big data and society is an important one, and therefore worthy of study. [...] Dalton and Thatcher stress how the relationship is not an example of technological determinism, but rather how big data can shape the lives of individuals. Big data technology can cause significant changes in society's structure and in the everyday lives of people, and being a product of society, big data technology is worthy of sociological investigation. Moreover, data sets are almost never completely raw, that is to say without any influences. Dalton and Thatcher describe how data are shaped by the vision or goals of a research team, and during the data collection process, certain things are quantified, stored, sorted and even discarded by the research team. A critical approach is thus necessary in order to understand and reveal the intent behind the information being presented. Dalton and Thatcher also argue how data alone cannot speak for itself; in order to possess any concrete meaning, data must be accompanied by theoretical insight or be accompanied by alternative quantitative or qualitative <b>research</b> <b>measures.</b> Dalton and Thatcher argue that if one were to only think of data in terms of its exploitative power, there is no possibility of using data for revolutionary, liberatory purposes. Finally, Dalton and Thatcher propose that a critical approach in studying data allows for 'big data' to be combined with older, 'small data,' and thus create more thorough research, opening up more opportunities, questions and topics to be explored.|$|E
40|$|Background National minimum {{standards}} for residential care homes were introduced following the Care Standards Act 2000 {{in response to}} concern {{about the lack of}} consistency and poor quality services. These standards are intended to reflect outcomes for service users and to be comprehensive in scope. Method This study compared ratings made by care standards inspectors with <b>research</b> <b>measures</b> for 52 homes for people with intellectual disabilities serving 299 people. The <b>research</b> <b>measures</b> focused on the lived experience of residential care, including engagement in meaningful activity, choice and participation in activities of daily living. They also included measures of related care practices and organizational arrangements. Results The <b>research</b> <b>measures</b> were in general significantly correlated with each other. Most of the care standards ratings were also correlated with each other. However, only two of 108 correlations between care standards and <b>research</b> <b>measures</b> were significant. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Conclusions This study confirms that the review of national {{minimum standards}} and modernization of inspection methods recently announced by the Department of Health and the Commission for Social Care Inspection are timely and appropriate. ...|$|E
