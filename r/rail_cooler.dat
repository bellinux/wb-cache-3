40|$|AbstractCaused by the {{differences}} in volume and heat dissipation area of rail head and bottom, latent heat of phase transition releasing and other reasons, the complicated temperature changes occurs in rail head and bottom between during the cooling process, especially in solid state phase transition. In the paper, the ANSYS heat-stress couple module is adopted to carry on numerical simulation on the cooling process of 60 kg/m U 75 V heavy rail. Though the post-processing result analyzed by using the post-processor module, we got the temperature changing rules for heavy <b>rail</b> <b>cooling</b> process. This paper is of great reference value for the bending deformation study in the hundred-meter heavy <b>rail</b> <b>cooling</b> processing...|$|R

25|$|The {{ventilation}} system maintains the air {{pressure in the}} service tunnel {{higher than in the}} rail tunnels, so that {{in the event of a}} fire, smoke does not enter the service tunnel from the <b>rail</b> tunnels. Two <b>cooling</b> water pipes in each rail tunnel circulate chilled water to remove heat generated by the rail traffic. Pumping stations remove water in the tunnels from rain, seepage, and so on.|$|R
50|$|The rails {{leading up}} to a stub switch are not secured to the {{sleepers}} for several feet, and rail alignment across the gap is not positively enforced. Stub switches also require some flexibility in the rails (meaning lighter rails), or an extra joint at which they hinge. Therefore, these switches cannot be traversed at high speed or by heavy traffic and so are not suitable for main line use. A further disadvantage is that a stub switch being approached from the diverging route that is not connected by the points {{would result in a}} derailment. Yet another disadvantage is that in very hot weather, expansion of the steel in the rails can cause the movable rails to stick to the stock rails, making switching impossible until the <b>rails</b> have <b>cooled</b> and contracted.|$|R
50|$|MAN {{water-cooled}} {{diesel engines}} of various power outputs and emissions compliance are used across the range, these including the D0836, D2066, D2676 and D2868. The engine remains positioned conventionally (longitudinally between the chassis <b>rails),</b> however, the <b>cooling</b> pack is located transversally {{at the rear}} of the cab. This location offers protection from damage and blockage of the radiator with mud etc. when operating off-road. It also allows for a larger volume radiator to be used, which enhances hot-climate operating capability.|$|R
50|$|A {{practical}} refrigerated (ice <b>cooled)</b> <b>rail</b> car {{was introduced}} in 1881. This {{made it possible to}} ship cattle and hog carcasses, which weighed only 40% as much as live animals; The entire national markets served by the railroads was opened up, as well as transatlantic markets using refrigerated ships. Gustavus Franklin Swift developed an integrated network of cattle procurement, slaughtering, meat-packing and shipping meat to market. Up to that time cattle were driven great distances to railroad shipping points, causing the cattle to lose considerable weight. Swift developed a large business, which grew in size with the entry of several competitors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the steel}} of U 71 Mn {{specifications}} for 60 kg/m heavy rail {{is seen as}} a research object. Experimental method is employed to study the heavy rail hardened layer, including surface hardness, micro-structure and cross-sectional hardness under different cooling time during quenching. Experimental results showed that obtained heavy <b>rail</b> after wind <b>cooling</b> quenching finally met the Tb/T 2344 - 2003 43 - 75 kg/m standard. Best quenching treatment condition is found and the defect is reduced to large extent when quenching time is 40 seconds, cooling time is 40 to 45 seconds, superior to the traditional spray cooling condition. These results provide an important reference for the quenching process of heavy rail...|$|R

60|$|August 24th.--Day before {{yesterday}} I took the <b>rail</b> for Southport,--a <b>cool,</b> generally overcast day, with glimmers of faint sunshine. The ride {{is through a}} most uninteresting tract of country, at first, glimpses of the river, with the thousands of masts in the docks; the dismal outskirts of a great town, still spreading onward, with beginnings of streets, and insulated brick buildings and blocks; farther on, a wide monotony of level plain, and {{here and there a}} village and a church; almost always a windmill in sight, there being plenty of breeze to turn its vans on this windy coast. The railway skirts along the sea the whole distance, but is shut out from the sight of it by the low sand-hills, which seem to have been heaped up by the waves. There are one or two lighthouses on the shore. I have not seen a drearier landscape, even in Lancashire.|$|R
40|$|Railway {{business}} (both in Sweden and internationally) {{is in need}} of {{efficient and}} non-destructive methods for convenient measurements of the neutral temperature. Banverket has hitherto made some investigations of different such methods and this analysis aims in this perspective to · Identify different techniques and methods that are possible to use for measuring the neutral temperature and sort out those that are not useful for rail applications. · Give the theoretical basis for each method in order to obtain a firm base for further investigations and judgements. · Perform critical examinations of the development potential, cost and time consumption for each of the methods and identifying those methods and equipments that are of most interest for further investigations. · Identify additional actions to be taken in combination with efficient neutral temperature determinations for reduction of the heat distortion risk in CWR-tracks. The following methods are possible candidates for further investigations: Ultrasonic methods Based on either the longitudinal wave principle or the birefringence principle with methods developed by, for example, NIST and RIPL. Deformation methods Based on measurements of either strains or of positions with commercial methods as the Pfender device, the MS- 02 device, the MP method or the geodesic method. Magnetic methods The Barkhausen noise principle seems to be more promising than the magnetic parameter method with developed testing methods by Railscan, Railtest and Rollscan. X-ray diffraction method Based on diffraction of X-rays in crystal planes, portable equipment exists although the method has traditionally been used under laboratory conditions. Rail vibration techniques method Based on the relation between stiffness and force in combination with an accurate laser measurement system, this method is a promising alternative. In parallel to improved measurement techniques for neutral temperature, a list of possible additional actions has been identified. These are additional logical ways to reduce the risk for rail heat distortions and they do not have any technical solutions today. The author is currently not aware of all possible efforts that have been made regarding these issues but they should be kept in mind during future work. For example: · Could <b>rail</b> <b>cooling</b> be performed by heat conduction to the cooler regions below the track? · Should the neutral temperature be increased (cf. chapter 3) ? · Could rail grinding improve the mechanical integrity? · Are there possible modifications of the CWR-concept itself that could reduce the thermal stress build up? · One obvious action is to improve the lateral resistance of the track region. This is the main focus of the accompanying report within this preliminary study. This preliminary study shows that there exist promising methods that would improve the measurements of neutral temperature. When this preliminary study is completed, it is therefore proposed that actions are taken for more detailed investigations of the one or two most promising methods. This should be done through field studies and laboratory studies in Sweden but also, where appropriate, through visits to places in Europe where the methods have been evaluated. It would also be of interest to study additional ways of reducing the risk for rail heat distortions...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 43) This report {{presents a}} finite-difference computational method {{to analyze the}} rail thermal transients of a space-based, convectively-cooled, multiple-shot, electromagnetic launcher. The technique can be employed for any internally or externally <b>cooled</b> <b>rail</b> configuration and with any coolant fluid, including liquid metals. Either an exponential or linear temperature profile, {{as a result of}} the ohmic heat generation incurred during the electromagnetic current pulse, can be evaluated. The technique was then utilized to analyze various rail configurations, coolant methods, and coolant fluids. For this study, an assumed initial energy distribution is input to the launcher rail and the process of ohmic heat generation is neglected. The analysis, therefore, gives a first order approximation since cooling is more severe when ongoing heat generation is present. Within this context, the study provides significant physical insight into the rapid <b>cooling</b> within the <b>rail.</b> The result of the analysis was the assessment of cooling methods to maximize the rate of heat removal from the rail structure...|$|R
50|$|Early locomotive-powered {{railways}} {{had used}} short cast iron rails carried on stone blocks. A few were trying timber sleepers {{to support the}} rails and to maintain the gauge between them. These rails were brittle and broke easily, and they gave a rough ride due {{to the difficulty of}} maintaining a smooth line between the blocks or sleepers. Wrought iron rails were being manufactured but they were of poor quality due to the difficulty of cooling them evenly during manufacture. Brunel decided to use a continuously supported wrought iron rail, a bridge rail with a smaller <b>rail</b> section that <b>cooled</b> more evenly. This was an inverted-U section with wide flanges that could be bolted to the timber bearer, which was known as a 'longitudinal' baulk. The rail was usually kept off this by small wooden packing pieces that could be replaced when they were worn out by the passage of the trains, and therefore avoid the expense of replacing the heavier longitudinals. The rails were bolted to the longitudinals by long fang bolts or coach screws, and the rail joints were later supported by a base plate formed with a plug in the void of the inverted U shape rails so as to keep the rails in line with each other.|$|R
