5000|$|Preamplifiers and {{equalizers}} for acoustic instruments or {{double basses}} {{can also be}} used to [...] "roll off" [...] the treble frequencies or [...] "notch out" [...] the [...] "scratchy-sounding" [...] frequencies. Since the EUB typically does not have a hollow sound chamber, or only includes a small sound chamber, the EUB is less prone to audio feedback than the double bass when amplified. To use a bow with an EUB, both the bridge and fingerboard must be <b>radiussed</b> (given a curve). EUBs are much easier to transport to gigs, or fly with on tours than a large, fragile double bass.|$|E
50|$|Since the EUB {{typically}} {{does not}} have a hollow sound chamber, or only includes a small sound chamber, the EUB is less prone to feedback than the double bass when amplified. To use a bow with an EUB, both the bridge and fingerboard need to be <b>radiussed</b> (given a curve). If the EUB's bridge and fingerboard are relatively flat, like those on an electric bass, then {{it is not possible to}} use the bow on the inner strings. By adjusting the amplifier tone controls an EUB can sound similar to an acoustic double bass. As well, by using tone controls and bass effects, an EUB can also take on a sound similar to a fretless bass guitar. Since the EUB transmits its sounds through a pickup, the tone is brighter than that of the acoustic double bass, which transmits its tone via the sound post to the back of the body. Compared to a double bass, the tone produced by an EUB is much less modified by its wooden 'body'.|$|E
5000|$|PD1/3: In Autumn 1946, the Construction and Use {{regulations}} were revised, allowing a maximum width for buses of 8', {{rather than the}} previous 7'6" [...] inches, provided the Traffic Commissioners approved the use of wider buses on routes, {{in the same way}} as they already had the power to approve double-deck buses on a route-by-route basis. Also, the gross vehicle weight for a double-deck bus was increased to 12 tons, from the wartime figure of 11 tons. The PD1/3 differed from the PD1 in that it had wider axles, being designed for the 8-foot width. Oldham Corporation quickly obtained clearance for all their routes and in 1947 DBU244 with Charles H. Roe H31/25R body became the first 8-foot-wide motorbus built for service in the UK. Oldham took in total 50 similar buses in 1947/8. Manchester Corporation were also early customers for the wider bus, following up their initial 1946 batch of fifty PD1s with a 1947/8 order for 100 PD1/3 with 58-seat (H32/26R) bodies to their standard outline by Metro-Cammell. During 1948 Ribble Motor Services, who had obtained permission to use full-width double-deck coaches on their express services from East Lancashire to Blackpool, received 30 such bodies by H. V. Burlingham of Blackpool, which had full-width cabs, electrically powered folding doors to the rear platform, which itself was built-up to saloon level, allowing a small luggage boot. The body design, with additional luggage stowage over the rear wheel arches, had generously <b>radiussed</b> windows, two sunroofs on the upper deck and, although of lowbridge layout (the Leyland patent on this expired in 1937), were fitted out to full coach standards for 49 passengers (FCL27/22RD). Liberal use was made of chromium-plated steel trim and they carried the cream coach livery, with red relief, rather than the bus livery of red with cream relief, they soon became famous as the [...] "White Ladies" [...] was so successful that a further twenty similar vehicles on PD2/3 chassis with East Lancashire Coachbuilders bodies, were added in 1951.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Heat transfer performance of steam condensing on horizontal finned tubes made of copper, aluminum, copper nickel(90 / 10), and stainless steel(316) was studied using a condenser test rig at both vacuum and atmospheric conditions. Integral fin tubes included conventional rectangular shaped fins {{as well as}} rectangular fins having a <b>radiussed</b> root geometry (ie, a fillet radius equal to half the fin spacing). All finned tubes had inner and outer diameters of 12. 70 mm and 15. 88 mm respectively, and had a fin thickness of l. 0 mm and a fin spacing of 1. 5 mm. The {{overall heat transfer coefficient}} (U sub o) was determined experimentally and the outside heat transfer coefficient (ho) was obtained utilizing a modified Wilson Plot procedure. Results indicated that the performance of a finned tube was strongly dependent on the tube material and weakly dependent on fin geometry. Radiussing the fin root to remove condensate between fins in the unflooded portion (ie, top portion) of a finned tube reduced the heat transfer performance compared to a conventional rectangular shaped integral fin. Experimental data were compared to the models of Beatty and Katz as well as to a modified model of Rose. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
