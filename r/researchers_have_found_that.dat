5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field to navigate during migration. Some <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in 2011 {{that they could not}} replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.|$|E
5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E

5|$|When {{examining}} {{groups of}} people with obstructive sleep apnea, <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black {{people are more likely}} to be obese than American whites, and are therefore more likely to develop OHS, but obese Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{a choice}} for instant versus delayed {{gratification}} {{is influenced by}} several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons {{to turn off the}} noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E

2500|$|Because placebos are {{dependent}} upon perception and expectation, various factors {{that change the}} perception can increase {{the magnitude of the}} placebo response. For example, studies <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the color and size of the placebo pill makes a difference, with [...] "hot-colored" [...] pills working better as stimulants while [...] "cool-colored" [...] pills work better as depressants. Capsules rather than tablets seem to be more effective, and size can make a difference.

50|$|Because {{conventional}} {{kitchen furniture}} {{of the time}} fit neither the new workflows nor the narrow space, the Frankfurt kitchen was installed complete with furniture and major appliances such as the stove, a novelty {{at that time in}} Germany. It was the first fitted kitchen. The wooden door and drawer fronts were painted blue because <b>researchers</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> flies avoided blue surfaces. Lihotzky used oak wood for flour containers, because it repelled mealworms, and beech for table tops because beech is resistant to staining, acids, and knifemarks. The seating was a revolving stool on castors for maximum flexibility.|$|R

Previously, <b>researchers</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the experience of dreaming itself—the successions of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations during the rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep (the stage when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake, when muscle tone and EEG readings are low, and when rapid and random eye movement during sleep takes place)—might {{be related to the}} process of learning.
