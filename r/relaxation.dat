5|$|The {{most widely}} {{documented}} mechanism {{is that the}} ingestion of food causes gastric distention, which is followed by abdominal compression and the simultaneous <b>relaxation</b> of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This creates a common cavity between the stomach and the oropharynx that allows the partially digested material {{to return to the}} mouth. There are several offered explanations for the sudden <b>relaxation</b> of the LES. Among these explanations {{is that it is a}} learned voluntary <b>relaxation,</b> which is common in those with or having had bulimia. While this <b>relaxation</b> may be voluntary, the overall process of rumination is still generally involuntary. <b>Relaxation</b> due to intra-abdominal pressure is another proposed explanation, which would make abdominal compression the primary mechanism. The third is an adaptation of the belch reflex, which is the most commonly described mechanism. The swallowing of air immediately prior to regurgitation causes the activation of the belching reflex that triggers the <b>relaxation</b> of the LES. Patients often describe a feeling similar to the onset of a belch preceding rumination.|$|E

In this paper, we {{consider}} partial Lagrangian <b>relaxations</b> of continuous quadratic formulations of the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) where the assignment constraints are not relaxed. These <b>relaxations</b> are a theoretical limit for semidefinite <b>relaxations</b> of the QAP using any linearized quadratic equalities {{made from the}} assignment constraints. Using this framework, we survey and compare standard semidefinite <b>relaxations</b> of this classical NP-hard problem. In particular, this approach is {{a simple way to}} prove that some well-known semidefinite <b>relaxations</b> for the QAP are equivalent. Nevertheless, these <b>relaxations</b> have a different numerical behavior and practical usefulness depending on the semidefinite programming solver.

40|$|Electrical field {{stimulation}} (EFS) of non-adrenergic non-cholinergic nerves of {{the mouse}} gastric fundus induced frequency-dependent transient <b>relaxations</b> which were mimicked by nitric oxide (NO), added as acidified NaNO 2. The NO donors S-nitrosocysteine, S-nitrosoglutathione, SIN- 1 and hydroxylamine induced sustained concentration-dependent <b>relaxations.</b> The NO synthase blocker L-nitro arginine (L-NOARG; 300 [*]μM) abolished the <b>relaxations</b> to EFS without affecting the <b>relaxations</b> to NO. The copper(I) chelator neocuproine (10 [*]μM) enhanced the <b>relaxations</b> to EFS and NO but inhibited those to S-nitrosocysteine and S-nitrosoglutathione. Neocuproine potentiated the <b>relaxations</b> to SIN- 1, which releases NO extracellularly, without affecting the <b>relaxations</b> to hydroxylamine, which releases NO intracellularly. The potentiating effect of neocuproine on the <b>relaxations</b> to EFS was more pronounced after inhibition of catalase with 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole (1 [*]mM) but not after inhibition of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) with diethyl dithiocarbamic acid (DETCA, 1 [*]mM). The potentiating effect of neocuproine on <b>relaxations</b> to NO was not altered by 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole or DETCA treatment. The <b>relaxations</b> to EFS were significantly inhibited by the oxidants hydrogen peroxide (70 [*]μM) and duroquinone (10 [*]μM) but only after inhibition of catalase with 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole or after inhibition of Cu/ZnSOD with DETCA respectively. Our results suggest that neocuproine can act as an antioxidant in the mouse gastric fundus and that both catalase and Cu/ZnSOD protect the nitrergic neurotransmitter from oxidative breakdown. Since inhibition of catalase but not inhibition of Cu/ZnSOD potentiated the effect of neocuproine on <b>relaxations</b> to EFS without affecting the <b>relaxations</b> to NO, catalase may protect the nitrergic neurotransmitter mainly at a prejunctional site whereas Cu/ZnSOD protects at a postjunctional site...|$|R

40|$|The nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) <b>relaxations</b> in {{response}} to electrical stimulation and acetylcholine in the canine terminal ileum and ileocolonic junction were further characterized and the possible involvement of the putative NANC neurotransmitter ATP was investigated. During a norepinephrine-induced contraction, noncumulative administration of ATP and the nicotinic agonist, 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4 -phenylpiperazinium (DMPP) induced concentration-dependent <b>relaxations</b> in both the terminal ileum and ileocolonic junction; these responses were not inhibited by atropine, timolol or guanethidine. Desensitization to ATP blocked the ATP-induced <b>relaxations,</b> but not those to electrical stimulation or acetylcholine. All <b>relaxations</b> were abolished by tetrodotoxin.

The <b>relaxations</b> to acetylcholine, ATP and DMPP were inhibited by lidocaine. Thus, in the canine terminal ileum and ileocolonic junction, ATP induces NANC <b>relaxations</b> of neuronal origin, but ATP {{is unlikely to be}} the final NANC neurotransmitter mediating the <b>relaxations</b> to electrical stimulation or acetylcholine.

Methods: Pig coronary arterial rings with endothelia were suspended in organ chambers flled with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution maintained at 37 °C and continuously aerated with 95 %O 2 and 5 % CO 2. Isometric tension was measured during contractions to prostaglandin F 2 α {{in the presence of}} indomethacin and NΩnitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME).

In all arteries from control animals, aggregating platelets caused endothelium-dependent <b>relaxations,</b> which were augmented by ketanserin (a 5 -HT 2 -serotonergic blocker), attenuated by apyrase (an adenosine diphosphatase and triphosphatase) or methiothepin (a combined 5 -HT 1 and 5 -HT 2 -serotonergic blocker) and were almost abolished {{by a combination of}} apyrase and methiothepin. The platelet-induced <b>relaxations</b> were most pronounced in the coronary arteries.

40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to determine the role of oxygen-derived free radicals in modulating contractions of vascular smooth muscle and endothelium-mediated <b>relaxations</b> to acetylcholine. The effects of generating or scavenging these radicals were studied in rings of canine coronary arteries suspended for isometric tension recording. Xanthine oxidase plus xanthine caused <b>relaxations,</b> which were greater in rings with endothelium than in rings without endothelium; the <b>relaxations</b> were not affected by superoxide dismutase or mannitol, but could be prevented by catalase. Xanthine oxidase plus xanthine depressed endothelium-mediated <b>relaxations</b> to acetylcholine; this effect was prevented by superoxide dismutase, but was not affected by catalase or mannitol. Exogenous hydrogen peroxide induced catalase-sensitive <b>relaxations,</b> which were depressed by {{the removal of the}} endothelium. Superoxide dismutase evoked catalase-sensitive <b>relaxations</b> only in rings with endothelium. Endothelium-mediated <b>relaxations</b> to acetylcholine were slightly depressed by superoxide dismutase or catalase alone; the combination of the two enzymes or mannitol caused a major shift {{to the right of the}} concentration-response curve to acetylcholine. In rings without endothelium, <b>relaxations</b> caused by sodium nitroprusside were not affected by the scavengers (alone or in combination) but were augmented by xanthine oxidase plus xanthine. These data suggest that 1) the endothelium-derived relaxing factor released by acetylcholine is not likely to be an oxygen-derived free radical; 2) hydrogen peroxide has a direct inhibitory action on coronary arterial smooth muscle and triggers endothelium-dependent relaxations; and 3) superoxide anions depress and hydroxyl radicals facilitate endothelium-dependent <b>relaxations</b> caused by activation of muscarinic receptors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} linear {{programming}} (LP) based <b>relaxations</b> for synthesizing polynomial Lyapunov functions {{to prove the}} stability of polynomial ODEs. A common approach to Lyapunov function synthesis starts from a desired parametric polynomial form of the polynomial Lyapunov function. Subsequently, we encode the positive-definiteness of the function, and the negative-definiteness of its derivative over the domain of interest. Therefore, the key primitives for this encoding include: (a) proving that a given polynomial is positive definite over a domain of interest, and (b) encoding the positive definiteness of a given parametric polynomial, as a constraint on the unknown parameters. We first examine two classes of <b>relaxations</b> for proving polynomial positivity: <b>relaxations</b> by sum-of-squares (SOS) programs, against <b>relaxations</b> that produce linear programs. We compare both types of <b>relaxations</b> by examining the class of polynomials that can {{be shown to be}} positive in each case.
