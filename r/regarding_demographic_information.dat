40|$|ABSTRACT. Some {{individuals}} manifest psychosomatic symptoms {{after the}} death of their pets. A survey was conducted at four public and commercial animal cremation service centers in Japan. In each center, a questionnaire was distributed to 100 individuals (400 in total). The questionnaire consisted of the 28 -item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ 28), the social readjustment rating scale (SRRS) and a series of questions <b>regarding</b> <b>demographic</b> <b>information</b> and the circumstances of their pet’s death. In total, 82 returned questionnaires were available for analysis. GHQ 28 proved the existence of neurotic symptoms in 46 responses (56. 1 %; 95 % confidence interval: 44. 7 %– 67. 0 %). Analysis of the responses using the GHQ 28 subscales with a Likert scoring system demonstrated more somati...|$|E
40|$|Class of 2013 AbstractSpecific Aims: To {{describe}} {{the outcomes of}} olanzapine {{in the treatment of}} refractory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Methods: Data were collected <b>regarding</b> <b>demographic</b> <b>information,</b> chemotherapy regimen, CINV prophylaxis, rescue antiemetics, and olanzapine usage for subjects, age 18 - 79, who were admitted to the University of Arizona Medical Center for chemotherapy and received at least one dose of olanzapine for CINV between January 2008 and January 2012. The primary outcome measure was the number of rescue antiemetics required following the first dose of olanzapine (greater than 10 doses was considered treatment failure). Comparisons using chi square to determine if differences existed with respect to the level of chemotherapy emetogenicity and demographic information were conducted. Main Results: No statistical difference between chemotherapy regimens of high versus low-to-moderate emetogenicity was seen (P= 0. 79). However, 7 of 10 (70...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} cross-sectional survey {{was to examine the}} health promotion attitudes and practices of Texas nurse practitioners and to evaluate the applicability of the Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior as a theoretical model to guide nurse practitioner health promotion research. A questionnaire developed to elicit responses <b>regarding</b> <b>demographic</b> <b>information,</b> practice characteristics, behavior, behavior intention, attitudes toward health promotion, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control for health promotion practices was mailed to the home address of 727 Texas nurse practitioners. The majority of the 442 respondents reported positive attitudes toward health promotion. Texas nurse practitioners provide health promotion for more than 50 % of their patients. Significant barriers to the provision of health promotion cited by Texas nurse practitioners were lack of time, lack of reimbursement and lack of patient desire to change behavior. The findings of this study support the use of the Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior in nurse practitioner research. ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to complete an examination of what adoption social workers do to teach adoptive parents regarding their adoptees' differing cultural and ethnic background. A questionnaire was sent to all adoption social workers employed by Children's Aid Societies in Ontario; 90 responded. The questionnaire included questions <b>regarding</b> <b>demographic</b> <b>information,</b> opinions of transracial adoption and also explored the actual actions taken to teach adoptive parents about their adoptees' differing cultural and ethnic background. Findings were that the majority of adoption social workers in Ontario are Caucasian, and that they have a high level of agreement with the appropriateness of transracial adoptions. The total actions taken by social workers to educate adoptive parents were found to be quite low; a higher number of actions taken was associated with: (1) The social workers being older; (2) The fact that they adopted transracially themselves; (3) Longer experience in social work, and specifically in adoption; (4) More transracial adoptions facilitated...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{that started in}} 2008 in many countries of the world, {{has resulted in the}} reduction of many jobs in all the regions of Italy, most especially in the Southern part of the Country. The employment difficulties experienced by both the unemployed and employed workers, experiencing increasingly precarious conditions, will inevitably result in a worsening of psycho-physical conditions of the population; especially as an increase in stress-related diseases. Aims: The aim {{of this study is to}} point-out the possible effects of the {{economic crisis}} on the health status of the population resident in Italy and Sicily, evaluating data from years preceding and following the year 2008. Methods: We have selected two populations: the first comprising the inhabitants of the Italian territory, the second comprising the inhabitants in the Sicilian territory. We evaluated official statistical data <b>regarding</b> <b>demographics,</b> <b>information</b> about lifestyles that can cause cardiovascular diseases, and also statistical data about job accidents and occupational diseases. We also investigated the use of antidepressant drugs, as indicators of psychological distress and metabolic diseases in the two populations. Results: Data analysis shows an overall increase of people migrating to foreign countries, increased unemployment for all age groups, with dramatic spikes in Sicily, and degenerating lifestyles associated with increasing numbers of subjects suffering from depression, diabetes and ischemic heart disease, although treatments and prognosis have improved. Work-related accidents only have been significantly reduced, while at the same time reports of occupational diseases increase.

40|$|Abstract Background: Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the most}} prevalent disorders in developed countries and heart failure is the major one among them. This disease is caused by numerous factors {{and one of the}} most considerable risk factors is unhealthy lifestyle. So the aim of this research was to study the effect of family-center empowerment model on the lifestyle of heart failure patients. Methods: This is a randomized controlled clinical trial on 70 heart failure patients referring to Hazrate Fatemeh heart clinic in Shiraz. After convenience sampling the patients were divided into two control and intervention groups using block randomization Method. The intervention based on family-center empowerment model was performed during 5 sessions. Research tools are lifestyle and <b>demographic</b> <b>information</b> questionnaires. Results: Both intervention and control groups were similar <b>regarding</b> their <b>demographic</b> <b>information</b> (P> 0. 001). Before the intervention on lifestyle, all measures of the two groups were equal (P> 0. 001) but after the intervention; statistically significant differences were reported in all dimensions of lifestyle, the total lifestyle score in the intervention group was 70. 09 ± 16. 38 and in the control group - 6. 03 ± 16. 36 (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that adults who sexually offend {{frequently}} report perpetrating a sexual offense {{for the first time}} during childhood/adolescence; therefore in this preliminary study, we examine the possible covariates related to offending sexually in adolescents. For this study, 62 incarcerated adolescents at a correctional facility in Alabama completed self-report questionnaires <b>regarding</b> <b>demographic</b> <b>information,</b> internalizing/externalizing behavior problems, attachment, and affect regulation. The results {{of this study indicate that}} attachment is related to internalizing and externalizing behaviors, as well as, both adaptive affect regulation and maladaptive affect regulation. Through path analyses, this study was the first to test and find that affect regulation ability mediated the relationship between attachment and externalizing behavior; however, it did not mediate the relationship between attachment and internalizing behavior. Interestingly, maladaptive affect regulation appeared to have a stronger influence on problem behaviors than adaptive affect regulation for these adolescents. The findings from this study could help professionals identify more successful therapeutic interventions for these adolescents and consequently prevent later sexual offending and further negative, individual or societal outcomes.

40|$|Introduction: Health beliefs {{significantly}} affect health promoting self-care behaviors. The most important model designed based on health beliefs is the Health Belief Model. This {{study examined the}} association between health belief model constructs and demographic factors with behaviors in elderly. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was performed on 465 elders referring to Tehran's cultural centers recruited with a multi-stage sampling method. Study instruments were questionnaires <b>regarding</b> <b>demographic</b> <b>information,</b> health beliefs, self-efficacy and health-promoting self-care behaviors. Data analysis was performed using SPSS- 22 software by Independent T-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation and Multiple linear regression. Results: The mean (±SD) age of subjects was 68. 24 ± 6. 12 years and the mean of general self-care score was 1. 79 ± 0. 36. Gender (P= 0. 011), economy (P< 0. 001), education level (P< 0. 001) and age (P= 0. 008) {{were significantly associated with}} self-care behaviors.

The main {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among dentists in Iran. A cross sectional study was carried out in Rasht, northern Iran. Participants were dental workers who completed structured questionnaire on the topic of musculoskeletal disorders related to their job. The first part of the questionnaire was self-administered <b>regarding</b> their <b>demographic</b> <b>information</b> and job satisfaction. The second part was the Nordic Musculoskeletal questionnaire for determining the site of pain, if any. The severity of pain was assessed by using Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The third section was RULA questionnaire (Rapid Upper Limb disorder Assessment) to determine the awkward posture during their work and eventually the need to improve the condition. A total of 92 dentists responded to the questionnaire. Seventy three percent of participant dentists had musculoskeletal pain. The common painful sites of the body were as follows: neck (43. 4 %), back (35. 8 %), and shoulder and wrist (each 25 %). Direct inspection was a risk factor for neck pain (OR: 35. 34, p< 0. 001). This study revealed a relatively high prevalence of musculoskeletal pain among dentists. The severity of pain was related to higher action level of the RULA score; indicating that dentists with higher RULA scores needed to adopt better working posture...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} correlates of maternal acceptance of preschool chil-dren {{in a sample}} of Mexican-American migrant farmworker mothers, including problems in life conditions (education, employment, relatives, friends, partnerlspouse, children, health, housing, and finances) and so-cial support (task, emotional, source, satisfaction, accessibility). One hundred Mexican-American mothers of preschoolers who participated in the Texas Migrant Council’s Headstart Program were interviewed with <b>regard</b> to <b>demographic</b> <b>information,</b> social support, and problems in life conditions. The results supported the hypothesis that total social support accounts for more variation in maternal acceptancehejection than prob-lems in life conditions alone. Social support accounted for 75 % of the variance in maternal acceptancelrejection of preschool children, and accessibility to support predicted the largest proportion of the variance. The results suggest that it i s important to identify Mexican-American migrant farmworker mothers isolated from social support, since such isolation, in combination with problems in life conditions, places their children at higher risk for maternal rejection. Long-term problematic l i f e conditions have been found to affect parental behavior during the preschool years. These conditions include the qual i ty of the mar i ta l relationship (Belsky 1984; Crouter, Belsky, & Spanier, 1983; Makosky, 1982), unemployment and social isolation (Garbarino & Sher-man, 1983; Zur-Szufiro & Longfellow, 1982), and financial status (Belle, 1982).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the relationship between lifestyle behaviors, stress, and weight in University of Arizona sorority women. The lifestyle behaviors that were identified that have a potential relationship included physical activity and alcohol consumption. The study population consisted of a convenience sample of 82 sorority women at the University of Arizona. Study participants were invited to complete an online survey that contained questions <b>regarding</b> <b>demographic</b> <b>information</b> and lifestyle behaviors and their respective frequencies. They were also asked to complete a Perceived Stress Scale and a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Many participants reported gaining weight during their college career, with a weight fluctuation between 0 and 10 pounds. The study population reported high alcohol consumption, low physical activity, moderate stress, and a diet lacking fruit and vegetable consumption. It was concluded that these lifestyle behaviors have a direct relationship as a predictor for weight gain in college sorority women. The combination of lifestyle behaviors represented in the study population help to explain why this weight change may be occurring. Interventional studies are needed to help reverse the negative health effects experienced by this population to improve weight and provide the basis for healthy weight management...|$|E

Dental assistants completed a measure of observed child stress during the visit. The results supported the hypothesis that higher scores of parental dental fear and parental dental anxiety would be correlated with higher ratings of observed child stress. Also, as hypothesized, parental reports of some preparation prior to the dental visit were correlated with higher ratings of child stress. The results of this study support the findings of prior research, emphasizing the importance of parental influence on the experience of the child and the ability of the child to cope in the face of potentially stressful situations...|$|E

Analyses were conducted to discover what relationships existed between the two major variables and selected demographic characteristics of the population. ^ An instrument was developed, piloted, and mailed to a stratified random sample of 300 Nebraska public school teachers, Classes 2, 3, 4, and 5. Two hundred thirty-five usable surveys were returned. A multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. Numbers, percentages, and some means were reported <b>regarding</b> the <b>demographic</b> <b>information</b> and frequency of participation in curriculum development. Numbers and percentages were also reported regarding involvement in curriculum development activities, at the present time and in the future. Information regarding motivators for involvement in curriculum development, those offered most often versus those the teacher would most like to receive, was also presented. ^ Teacher job satisfaction was not found to be related to the opportunity to be involved in curriculum development, at least as curriculum development was described in this study. Teacher assignment and time in current position were found to be significant predictors of involvement in curriculum development. Also determined was the fact that teachers would rather receive additional pay for being involved in curriculum development activities than any of the other motivators suggested in this study, intrinsic or extrinsic. Teachers were generally involved in curriculum development through textbook selection. If properly prepared, some teachers indicated they would like to be involved in other aspects of curriculum development. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] Prosthetic valve obstruction is a relatively rare, but potentially fatal complication in patients with prosthetic heart valves. The diagnosis and appropriate management of these patients present a challenge to both the cardiologist and the cardiac surgeon. Despite efforts over the last 30 years to prevent this complication, it remains a lifelong risk. Obstruction is caused by pannus formation, thrombus formation {{or a combination of}} pannus and thrombus. Valve replacement has traditionally been the treatment of choice. Methods: Patients were selected from echocardiography and surgical reports between January 1991 and February 2001. All patients were analysed with <b>regard</b> to <b>demographic</b> <b>information,</b> clinical features, imaging results, treatment and outcome data. INR values on presentation were obtained from haematology archives. Results: A total of 32 patients presented on 34 occasions. There were 25 women and seven men. Obstruction occurred in the mitral position in 56 % of cases and in the aortic position in 44 % of cases. All but two valves were St Jude bileaflet valves. Patients generally presented with severe dyspnoea (NYHA class IV in 64. 7 %) and poor anticoagulation control (INR < 2. 5 in 75. 8 %). The initial imaging modality used in all cases was transthoracic echocardiography. Fluoroscopy was used in five cases and transesophageal echocardiography in only two cases. Valve replacement was performed on 20 patients, six patients received thrombolysis and the remaining eight patients did not receive any treatment. Outcome was poor with an overall mortality of 64. 7 %.

40|$|The {{goals of}} the present study were to: (1) explore the extent to which Hispanic-American and European-American {{patients}} report different perceptions of primary care service quality and healthcare utilization patterns, and (2) identify within each ethnic group independent demographic, cultural, medical, and psychological predictors of perceptions of primary care service quality. Two hundred and ten (116 Hispanic-American and 94 European-American) adult primary care patients from three general medical settings completed questionnaires <b>regarding</b> their <b>demographic</b> <b>information,</b> perceptions of primary care service quality, participation in medical treatment decisions, general physical health, psychological wellbeing, level of acculturation, perceived discrimination, and healthcare utilization patterns. All questionnaires were translated into Spanish and English; participants unable to read or write were interviewed privately. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine mediators and moderators of the relation between patient predictor variables and perceptions of primary care services. Patient socioeconomic status mediated all differences between ethnic groups regarding perceptions of trust in medical providers, healthcare utilization patterns, as well as general physical and psychological health. Hispanic-American patients who were less acculturated in dominant society and who reported psychological distress or perceived life discrimination also indicated less satisfaction with the quality of primary care services they received. Psychologically distressed European-American patients who were younger or male {{were also more likely to}} perceive poorer medical services. Patients who participated more actively in treatment decision-making with providers reported higher ratings of primary care service quality, especially among the following patient groups: Hispanic Americans who were less acculturated in dominant society, Hispanic Americans who perceived greater life discrimination, and European Americans who indicated greater psychological distress. This study highlights the patient variables related to positive and negative perceptions of primary care services quality among Hispanic-American and European-American patients. In addition, these findings point to the physician behaviors that may enhance the relationship these patients share with their providers. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the impact that components of Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) have on choice behavior and academic performance in African American or Black, undergraduate students. SCCT is a highly valued and researched theory, but few studies examine the impact that SCCT components have on choice behavior and academic performance in Black college students. This study focused on evaluating SCCT components’ relevance to variables that {{have been shown to}} predict later objective career success. This is important because African Americans tend to have significantly lower paying and less prestigious jobs, as well as attain lower levels of education than most other racial populations in the United States. However, there is a paucity of current career development and attainment literature specific to the African American undergraduate population. In an effort to promote understanding of within group differences in SCCT variables that can contribute to educational and career success, 247 African American undergraduates were recruited to participate in this study. The participants completed online questionnaires <b>regarding</b> <b>demographic</b> <b>information,</b> self-efficacy, contextual barriers, contextual supports, choice goals, and choice behavior. Participants also gave permission for researchers to access grades. Findings indicate that academic coping self-efficacy, contextual barriers, and contextual supports may be particularly important to academic choice behavior in African American college students. Further, choice behavior appears to be important to grade point average. Implications, limitations, and recommendations for future research associated with this study’s findings are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: One of {{the major}} {{complications}} of cardiac surgery {{is the presence of}} post-operative bleeding. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the topical application of tranexamic acid in the pericardial cavity on post-operative bleeding in off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Materials and Methods: This study was on 71 patients who underwent off-pump CABG. The anesthesia and surgery methods were the same for all patients. Patients were assigned to two equal groups. In the first group, 1 g of tranexamic acid in 100 mL of normal saline solution (NSS) was applied to pericardium and mediastinal cavity at the end of surgery. In the second group, only 100 mL of NSS was applied. Chest drainage of the patients after 24 h and the amounts of blood and blood products transfusion were also recorded during this time. Results: Patients were the same <b>regarding</b> <b>demographic</b> <b>information</b> and surgery. The average volume of blood loss after 24 h was 366 mL for the first group and 788 mL for the control group. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P < 0. 001). The amount of packed red blood cells transfusion in the first group was less than that of the control group, which was not statistically significant. There was no statistically significant difference between the amount of hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time in the post-operative stage in the two groups. Conclusion: The topical application of tranexamic acid in off-pump CABG patients leads to a decreased post-operative blood loss...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Children due {{to their}} small size and {{insufficient}} mental and physical abilities, {{are not able to}} defend themselves against accident, therefore childhood is the riskiest period of life. Different factors affect accidents occurrence and damages caused by them. The aim of present study was to assess knowledge and attitudes of parents regarding how to keep children in private cars. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive analytical study with easy sampling method which was performed during summer of 2013 on 170 personnel of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. All participants signed an informed consent form, and then they received two questionnaires <b>regarding</b> <b>demographic</b> <b>information</b> and knowledge & attitude. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 16, using descriptive statistical tests, chi square and Mann Whitney tests. Results: Knowledge of parents regarding how to carry children in private cars was in medium level and their attitude was weak. Gender did not affect knowledge and attitude level significantly (p> 0. 005). Conclusion: Since knowledge level of parents was at medium level and their attitude was weak, researchers recommend performing educational classes to introduce parents with accidents and traffic dangers especially how to carry children in private cars to improve children's safety.
