5|$|The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops {{allowed the}} Spanish to march {{straight}} into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor {{was still in}} bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window onto the beach below and jumped out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships on a log. He passed out and would probably have drowned {{had he not been}} picked up and brought aboard the Hero by one of his naval officers. MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the Hero, then despatched runners to <b>Rafter</b> ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that <b>Rafter</b> received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the Hero. <b>Rafter,</b> in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas. Abandoned, Colonel <b>Rafter</b> and the remnants of MacGregor's army {{had no choice but to}} surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. <b>Rafter</b> was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Robert Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) is {{a detective}} with the Seattle Police Department's {{homicide}} division. Bletcher {{had worked with}} Black during Black's law-enforcement career, and becomes his liaison with the police when Black returns to Seattle. The detective is murdered by Lucy Butler when she breaks into the Blacks' house, and he is hung from a basement <b>rafter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Timber trusses {{also are}} {{built in a}} variety of styles using wood or metal joints. Heavy timber <b>rafters</b> {{typically}} spaced 8 ft to 12 ft apart are called principal <b>rafters.</b> Principal <b>rafters</b> may be mixed with common <b>rafters</b> or carry common purlins.|$|R

5|$|The {{other is}} a 1/55th arsenal model {{realised}} by master Boubénec between 1951 and 1952, {{under the direction of}} Captain Diaz de Soria. It was built from the plans of the hull and <b>rafter</b> of the ship, though sculptures were undocumented and had to be reconstituted from drawings. It is currently on display at the Musée de la Marine et de l'Économie de Marseille.|$|E
5|$|Black {{struggles to}} find {{anything}} useful while investigating the abduction. However, he begins to experience seemingly-psychic visions which lead him to believe she {{is being held in}} their former home. The police raid the address but find it empty; Black finds a polaroid of another house inside. He is able to track down the address of this house, but goes alone this time. Reaching it, he finds Catherine in the basement, bound to a <b>rafter.</b> He goes to untie her but is blinded by a camera flash. He struggles with the Polaroid Man, which we see through a series of photographs taken by the man's camera. Black is able to wrest the Polaroid Man's knife away from him and stab him to death.|$|E
5|$|The manager's {{house was}} built of brick and stucco around 1920. It is two stories high, four bays wide, two bays deep, and has an {{asymmetrical}} plan. The building has a shallow hip roof with exposed <b>rafter</b> ends. Its windows are primarily one-over-one and double-hung with wood trim, with window-sills made of concrete. There is a three-story rectangular brick tower set into the main (west) facade. The tower is open at the top beneath a wide wood fascia. The building has a brick chimney decorated with corbelling; its chimney coping and caps are made of concrete. The building is now rented to the members.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of these}} very strong and rigid joints, some of the bending moment in the <b>rafters</b> is {{transferred}} to the columns. This means {{that the size of}} the <b>rafters</b> can be reduced or the span can be increased for the same size <b>rafters.</b> This makes portal frames a very efficient construction technique to use for wide span buildings.|$|R
50|$|The towers had {{a central}} pillar, also of {{thoroughly}} dressed stone blocks, which supported the ceiling <b>rafters.</b> Purlines rested on pilasters or cornerstones, and common <b>rafters,</b> in their turn, {{rested on the}} purlines. The upper floors consisted of wood sticks resting on the <b>rafters,</b> coated with punned clay. The ground floor was paved with boards or stone slabs.|$|R
5000|$|Another detail {{unique to}} this style are the ōgidaruki (lit. fan <b>rafters).</b> The <b>rafters</b> {{supporting}} each roof corner spread {{from a single}} point, in a fan-like pattern.|$|R
5|$|Benchley re-entered Hollywood at {{the height}} of the Great Depression and the {{large-scale}} introduction of the talkie films he had begun working with years before. His arrival put him on the scene of a number of productions almost instantly. While Benchley was more interested in writing than acting, one of his more important roles as an actor was as a salesman in <b>Rafter</b> Romance, and his work attracted the interest of MGM, who offered Benchley a lot of money to complete a series of short films. Benchley, who had also been offered a syndicated column by Hearst, was able to film the shorts in New York and keep up with his new column. Before heading back to New York, Benchley took a role in the feature film Dancing Lady (1933), which also featured Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Fred Astaire, Nelson Eddy, and the Three Stooges.|$|E
5|$|Cid {{is confronted}} by Vaan, Balthier and {{company at the}} Draklor Laboratory, which results in a fight that Cid loses. Cid survives the {{encounter}} and flees. Cid goes to the Pharos lighthouse to invoke the Sun-Cryst's full power, revealing himself to the main characters there once Gabranth is defeated. Enraged, Gabranth tries to attack Cid, who teleports {{out of the way}} as Venat throws the judge against a wall. Cid fights Vaan, Balthier and the rest of the party once again, and again loses. Cid dies after the battle, dissolving into energy absorbed by the Sun-Cryst before it is destroyed and fully activates his final airship, the Bahamut. A character named Cid appears or is mentioned in every main Final Fantasy. He made his debut appearance in Final Fantasy II, though this appearance is the first Final Fantasy game to feature a Cid character as a villain. Cid was voiced by John <b>Rafter</b> Lee in English and by Chikao Ōtsuka in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|In November 2003, Webber {{organised}} and {{competed in}} a 10-day trek across Tasmania {{to raise funds}} for children's cancer research charities. Starting in Marrawah on the state's west coast, the trek involved 1,000km of cycling, kayaking and trekking along the southern coast and finished at Coles Bay in the east. Four teams of four competitors each started the trek, with only two teams (including Webber's) completing the entire journey. Along the way, Australian sporting stars Pat <b>Rafter</b> (tennis), Steve Waugh (cricket), Cathy Freeman (athletics), James Tomkins (rowing), Guy Andrews (iron man), and actor Joel Edgerton completed certain parts of the trek. The challenge concluded with a black tie dinner and auction to raise funds. Webber said he was driven to organise the event {{after the death of his}} grandfather to cancer, as well as his experiences with friends whose children had battled the disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{men came}} close to mutiny at Aux Cayes in February 1819 when MacGregor failed to produce the 80 silver dollars per man on arrival promised by his recruiters. MacGregor persuaded South American merchants in Haiti to support him with funds, weapons and ammunition, but then procrastinated and gave the order to sail for the island of San Andrés, off the Spanish-controlled Isthmus of Panama, only on 10 March. Going first to Jamaica to arrange {{accommodation}} for Josefa and Gregorio, MacGregor was almost arrested there on charges of gun-running. He joined his troops on San Andrés on 4 April. The delay had led to renewed dissension in the ranks that the stand-in commander Colonel William <b>Rafter</b> had difficulty containing. MacGregor restored morale by announcing that they would set out to attack Porto Bello on the New Granadian mainland the following day.|$|E
5|$|This {{structure}} {{was built in}} the mid-15th century. At the southern end is a shallow raised dais on which the Lytes and favoured guests would have sat at a long table, facing the rest of the hall where the servants would have dined. The roof has arch-braced-collar trusses, with double purlins, and cusped curved windbraces. Typical of West Country design, these carved windbraces are both decorative and practical. Beneath is a cornice of pierced quatrefoils, and at the base of each main <b>rafter</b> is a carved wooden angel with a shield with the Lyte arms. The fireplace is 15th century, while the windows and the stained glass in them date from the early 16th century. The hall is entered from the east front porch via the screens passage, which would have divided the Hall from the kitchen and servants quarters' which would have lain {{to the left of the}} hall. The screen and gallery are not original, having been inserted by Sir Walter Jenner in 1907. He based the decoration on that of the arch from the Great Hall through to the Oriel Room. At the time of Jenner's arrival in 1907 the Great Hall was being used as a cider store.|$|E
25|$|Injuries plagued Mark's {{availability}} for Davis cup and was {{the cause}} of a public rift between team-mates Patrick <b>Rafter</b> and Lleyton Hewitt. <b>Rafter</b> publicly accused Philippoussis of jerking the team around after he withdrew from a Davis Cup tie in late 2000. Philippoussis said <b>Rafter</b> was ill-informed and upset by the lack of support and understanding from his team-mates.|$|E

25|$|Sampras lost in {{the final}} of the Cincinnati Masters to Patrick <b>Rafter</b> after a {{controversial}} line call. Sampras faced <b>Rafter</b> again in the semifinals of the US Open, losing in five sets after leading the match two sets to one, and <b>Rafter</b> went on to win his second consecutive US Open title. Sampras lost another semifinal at the Tennis Masters Cup to eventual champion Àlex Corretja. Nevertheless, Sampras finished the year as the top-ranked player for the sixth year in a row.|$|E
25|$|Sampras, whose struggles from 1998 {{continued}} over {{to early}} 1999, lost a third consecutive time against <b>Rafter</b> at the World Team Cup, in straight sets, {{just before the}} French Open. By the summer of 1999 having rebuilt his confidence, en route to compiling a 24-match winning streak of four titles including Wimbledon, Sampras prevailed against <b>Rafter</b> in the Cincinnati Masters final, a rematch of the previous year's final, and the two were friendly in the trophy ceremony. Later that summer, Sampras withdrew from the U.S. Open due to an injured back, while <b>Rafter</b> retired {{in the first round}} {{as a result of a}} torn rotor cuff.|$|E
25|$|Sampras and <b>Rafter</b> met in {{the fourth}} round of the 2001 US Open, with Sampras winning.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wall plates}} support the roof trusses, {{consisting}} {{of a pair of}} principal <b>rafters</b> and an additional pair of intersecting [...] "scissor rafters". For lateral bracing, additional wooden brackets (bueknær) are inserted between the <b>rafters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The barn {{was built}} in 1942 from {{materials}} made by Rilco (Rock Island Lumber Company), a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser located in Albert Lea, Minnesota. The company {{had a number of}} premanufactured barn patterns available from a catalog. This method of barn construction became popular in the late 1930s. The roof has a Gothic arch shape formed from laminated timber <b>rafters.</b> The glued laminated timber <b>rafters</b> had been developed in Europe and introduced to the United States in 1934. The United States Department of Agriculture issued a technical bulletin in 1939 on the use of these <b>rafters,</b> and Rilco was founded in Saint Paul, Minnesota that same year. Rilco's marketing literature at the time promoted the <b>rafters</b> as being [...] "factory-fabricated and engineered", and the <b>rafters</b> were shipped predrilled and ready for assembly with all hardware included.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rafters</b> {{are exposed}} below the diagonally boarded ceiling. Trusses are formed where timber tie beams are {{attached}} to the underside of four of the <b>rafters</b> and connected back to the walls by curved timber braces.|$|R

25|$|Sampras won 12 of the 16 matches {{he played}} against <b>Rafter,</b> {{including}} eight {{of their first}} nine, and their final four meetings.|$|E
25|$|The next Sampras-Rafter {{match was}} the 2000 Wimbledon final, after <b>Rafter</b> overcame Agassi in the semifinals, a four-set final which {{included}} a 26-minute rain delay. Both players had flown in their parents for the Wimbledon final, {{the first time in}} years they would see their sons play. Sampras lost the first set tiebreaker, and trailed in the second-set tiebreaker 1-4 before taking 5 consecutive points to win that set, then won the third and fourth sets for the Championship, with just 10 minutes of daylight left. That victory gave Sampras his 13th Grand Slam title, breaking the record of 12 by Roy Emerson for the most Grand Slam titles. After the match ended, Sampras called <b>Rafter</b> “all class, on and off the court”, while <b>Rafter</b> said he was lucky to overcome early season injuries to make the final.|$|E

50|$|A {{collar beam}} or collar is a {{horizontal}} member between two <b>rafters</b> {{and is very}} common in domestic roof construction. Often a collar is structural {{but they may be}} used simply to frame a ceiling. A collar beam is often called a collar tie but this is rarely correct. A tie in building construction is an element in tension rather than compression and most collar beams are designed to work in compression to keep the <b>rafters</b> from sagging. A collar {{near the bottom of the}} <b>rafters</b> may replace a tie beam and be designed to keep the <b>rafters</b> from spreading, thus are in tension: these are correctly called a collar tie.|$|R
5000|$|The {{horizontal}} [...] "fascia board" [...] which caps {{the end of}} <b>rafters</b> {{outside a}} building {{may be used to}} hold the rain gutter. The finished surface below the fascia and <b>rafters</b> is called the soffit or eave.|$|R
