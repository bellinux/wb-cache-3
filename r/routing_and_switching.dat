5000|$|The Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician (CCENT) {{certification}} is {{the first}} stage of Cisco's certification system. The CCENT certification is an interim step to Associate level or directly with CCNA and CCDA certifications. While the CCENT covers basic networking knowledge; it does not get involved with the more intricate technical aspects of the Cisco <b>routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> and network design. The certification does validate the skills essential for entry-level network support positions. CCENT qualified individuals have the knowledge and skill to install, manage, maintain and troubleshoot a small enterprise branch network, including network security. The CCENT curriculum covers networking fundamentals, WAN technologies, basic security, <b>routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> fundamentals, and configuring simple networks. The applicable training is Cisco ICND1 ("Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices, Part 1") and the exam is ("100-105" [...] ICND1), and it costs $150 retail.

40|$|By {{the end of}} the 1990 s, {{the optical}} fiber "backbone" of the {{telecommunication}} and data-communication networks had evolved from megabits-per-second transmission rates to gigabits-per-second transmission rates. Despite this boom in bandwidth, however, users at the end nodes were still not being reached on a consistent basis. (An end node is any device that does not behave like a router or a managed hub or switch. Examples of end node objects are computers, printers, serial interface processor phones, and unmanaged hubs <b>and</b> <b>switches.)</b> The primary reason that prevents bandwidth from reaching the end nodes is the complex local network topology that exists between the optical backbone and the end nodes. This complex network topology consists of several layers of <b>routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>switch</b> equipment which introduce potential congestion points and network latency. By breaking down the complex network topology, a true optical connection can be achieved.

50|$|<b>Routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> enables {{data to be}} {{dynamically}} transmitted {{over the}} network to other nodes. Routing protocols {{must be able to}} identify nodes transmitted within their own platform and data to be sent to other platforms regardless of the current topology. The routing protocol must also provide seamless roaming by ensuring that no routed packets are lost when a node changes its point of attachment to the network. Maintaining scalability is important in routing as the network is constantly changing. The network must be able to function with numerous levels of platforms, varying numbers of fast moving platforms, and varying amounts of traffic per platform. Routers and switches will use metrics to determine the best paths to take when routing data. The routing protocol utilized for the AN will be an Adaptive Quality of Service routing protocol.|$|E

It was a registered trademark by AT&T from September 4, 1962 to March 13, 1984. It is standardized by ITU-T Recommendation Q.23. In the UK, it is also known as MF4.

40|$|Abstract—Modern {{parallel}} {{and distributed}} applications {{have a wide}} range of communication characteristics and performance requirements. These diverse characteristics affect the performance and suitability of particular <b>routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> policies in multihop point-to-point networks. In this paper, we identify a core set of architectural features necessary for flexible selection and implementation of multiple <b>routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> schemes. Using this, we present a flexible router whose <b>routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> policies can be tailored to the application, allowing the network to meet these diverse needs. By dedicating a small programmable processor to each incoming link, we can implement wormhole, virtual cut-through, and packet switching, as well as hybrid switching schemes, each under a variety of unicast and multicast routing algorithms. In addition, a flexible router can support several applications or traffic types simultaneously, enabling better support of applications with multiple traffic classes. We have designed, implemented, and fabricated the Programmable Routing Controller (PRC). Cycle-level simulations of mesh-connected PRCs also demonstrate that flexible <b>routing</b> <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> can significantly enhance application performance.
