5|$|During his 1904campaign to {{be elected}} governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward promised to drain the Everglades, and his later {{projects}} were more effective than Disston's. Broward's promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer's report, pressure from <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>developers,</b> and the burgeoning tourist industry throughout south Florida. The increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of wading birds (hunted for their plumes), alligators, and other Everglades animals.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 60 years of {{continuous}} operation, the Cacchio family {{decided to sell}} the Theatre. Rather than sell to <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>developers,</b> the Cacchios preferred to transfer the property to the Rosendale Theatre Collective, a nonprofit formed in late 2009 {{for the sole purpose}} of buying and preserving the Theatre. The group spent months raising funds for a down payment on the building, with the bulk of its money coming from small individual donations. About 60 fundraisers were held, and a large grant was provided by PepsiCo after the Theatre Collective ran a successful social networking campaign for the April 2010 Pepsi Refresh Project. The Cacchios transferred ownership of the property to the Theatre Collective on August19, 2010. Since its purchase, the Theatre has had several equipment upgrades, including a move to digital cinema.|$|E

5|$|Settlements {{along the}} eastern shore of Lake Washington were {{established}} in the late 19th century by homesteaders, <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>developers,</b> and industrialists. A ferry system was set up between towns on the lake and Seattle to the west in the 1880s. By 1913, the steam ferry Leschi was transporting automobiles, in addition to pedestrian traffic, between Seattle and docks in Bellevue, Kirkland, and Medina. In 1940, the Lake Washington Floating Bridge was opened between Seattle and Mercer Island, carrying the Sunset Highway (later I-90) from Seattle towards Bellevue and the Eastside. The new bridge allowed for the Eastside to rapidly develop into bedroom communities in the 1940s and 1950s; the bridge also replaced the ferry system, which ceased operation in 1950, shortly after the removal of tolls on the bridge.|$|E

25|$|In 1910, the Swetland family, major <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>developers</b> in {{downtown}} Cleveland, built the Swetland Building (at 1010 Euclid Avenue) {{adjacent to the}} Cleveland Trust Company Building. The building was 13 stories tall and Chicago school architectural style.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 19th century, {{much of what}} is now Alphabet City was an {{extensive}} salt marsh, a type of wetland {{that was part of the}} East River ecosystem.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{outskirts}} of Devichye Pole began attracting <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>developers.</b> In 1914, shortly before World War I, an eight-story Cloudbreaker (Тучерез) apartment building was {{started at the}} northern end of the campus. Despite the war, it was completed in 1917. The building, at Malaya Pirogovskaya, 16, is sometimes mistaken for stalinist architecture.|$|E

25|$|Until recently, {{construction}} {{on the banks of}} the Lake had been largely under the control of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>developers.</b> Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters.

25|$|The McCallum Hill Building was {{constructed}} in 1913 {{on the north side}} of the street from the northeast corner of the park. For many years it was the largest private office building in the city and the tallest building in Saskatchewan at ten storeys high, of course only rivaled in height and conspicuousness within the province by the Hotel Saskatchewan in Regina and Saskatoon’s Bessborough Hotel. <b>Real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>developers</b> E.A. McCallum, E. M. McCallum and Walter H.A. Hill began construction of the McCallum-Hill office building in 1912.|$|E
25|$|<b>Real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>developers</b> in Hong Kong often {{give their}} {{buildings}} French names, such as Bel-Air, Les Saisons and Belle Mer.

Sometimes only French elements such as articles and prepositions {{are added to the}} name, {{as in the case of}} the restaurant chain Café de Coral. Similar mixing of English and French can be seen on the menu of Délifrance, a French-style restaurant chain in Hong Kong.|$|E

Once again, the Athletics' star players were traded or sold, as the new owners' goal was to cut payroll drastically. Many landed with the St. Louis Cardinals, including McGwire, Eckersley, and manager La Russa. In a turn of events eerily reminiscent of the A's Roger Maris trade 38 years before, Mark McGwire celebrated his first full season with the Cardinals by setting a new major league home run record.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its small}} population, Andros Island has several ongoing {{commercial}} ventures. Western Air maintains {{its headquarters in}} a modern facility at the San Andros airport. A Mennonite mission-run commercial farm was founded near Blanket Sound in 1983, which grows everything from habanera peppers to sorghum and potatoes, and has numerous fruit orchards and honey bee hives. The Mennonites also run the largest car repair and carpentry shops on the island. Androsia, a hand-crafted batik factory founded at Fresh Creek in 1972, produces a vibrant, colourful fabric which {{has become part of}} the national dress and identity of the Bahamas. GreenLife Growers, a Bahamian native tree nursery at Young Sound, provides landscaping material to <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>developers</b> and government projects throughout the Bahamas.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, {{downtown}} comprised {{a modest}} collection of mid-rise office structures, but has since grown {{into one of}} the largest skylines in the United States. In 1960, the central business district had 10 million square feet (930,000m²) of office space, increasing to about 16million square feet (1,500,000m²) in 1970. Downtown Houston was on the threshold of a boom in 1970 with 8.7million square feet (800,000m²) of office space planned or under construction and huge projects being launched by <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>developers.</b> The largest proposed development was the 32-block Houston Center. Only {{a small part of the}} original proposal was ultimately constructed, however. Other large projects included the Cullen Center, Allen Center, and towers for Shell Oil Company. The surge of skyscrapers mirrored the skyscraper booms in other cities, such as Los Angeles and Dallas. Houston experienced another downtown construction spurt in the 1970s with the energy industry boom.|$|E
