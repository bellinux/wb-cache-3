Other rides added over the years include a river rafting ride called White Water Canyon, which opened in 1985, and a heavily-themed, indoor flat ride called Tomb Raider: The Ride (later renamed The Crypt), which opened in place of Kenton's Cove Keelboat Canal in 2002. The Crypt closed permanently in 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Wilma {{made several}} landfalls, {{with the most}} {{destructive}} effects felt in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, Cuba, and the U.S. state of Florida.

As a result, Wilma is ranked as the sixth costliest hurricane in United States history. Wilma was the most recent major hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous United States until Hurricane Harvey made landfall in southern Texas on August 26, 2017, ending a <b>record</b> <b>length</b> of time – slightly over 11 years and 10 months – without any major hurricanes making landfall in the United States. Wilma was also the last hurricane to strike the state of Florida until Hurricane Hermine did so nearly 11 years later in 2016, another record. Wilma was also the last major hurricane to make landfall in Florida until Hurricane Irma made landfall in early September 2017.|$|E

It is also worth to note that 1974 Oldsmobile 98 4-door hardtop was the longest car with that body style sold that year, since the longer Lincoln Continental, Cadillac Sixty Special and Cadillac Series 75 were basically sedans (and 1974 Lincoln Continental came only with one hardtop body style: the 2-door).

Very few cars were so equipped. The high cost ($700) plus public uncertainty about the yet-to-be proven safety systems that are now universal in today's automobiles saw quite handily to that.|$|E
