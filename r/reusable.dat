5|$|A <b>reusable</b> Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} {{implemented}} about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a <b>reusable</b> orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.|$|E
5|$|Additionally {{a family}} of {{derivative}} launch vehicles was proposed {{in order to take}} an advantage of economies of scale, further reducing launch costs. These derivatives include a <b>Reusable</b> First Stage in a class of small and medium size launch vehicles like Vega and Arianespace Soyuz, the Super-Heavy Lift Launcher capable of lifting nearly 70 tonnes to the orbit, and a Two-Stage-To-Orbit system operating a dedicated <b>reusable</b> orbiter.|$|E
5|$|The engines {{would not}} be <b>reusable,</b> as they would be {{permanently}} attached to the discarded stages.|$|E
5|$|Argo Tea {{advocates for}} sustainability, {{demonstrates}} concern {{and awareness of}} environmental issues in their business plan and uses charitable donations to promote research as noted above. The company has an environmentally friendly business plan that includes encouraging use of <b>reusable</b> service-ware such as ceramic mugs and plates and washable silverware by its dine-in customers. Argo also markets <b>reusable</b> tea tumblers, which enable its customers to obtain discounted pricing on its drinks. The company considers sustainability and environmental consciousness in all phases of its business including supplier, operations, store design and product decisions.|$|E
5|$|Microgrids, Paul Allen is {{currently}} funding {{the building of}} microgrids, which are small-scale power grids that can operate independently, in Kenya to help promote <b>reusable</b> energy and empower its businesses and residents.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to offset}} the impact that the tour {{would have on the}} environment, Music for Relief and {{environmental}} non-profit Rewerb promoted greener touring practices such as recycling throughout the venue, free water stations for refillable bottles, <b>reusable</b> products and carpooling incentives. Touring vehicles were powered by low-emissions renewable biodiesel, a fuel made partly from vegetable oil. Non-profit organizations Love Hope Strength and HeadCount joined the tour for select dates.|$|E
5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, <b>reusable</b> bottle or other <b>reusable</b> containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Navy {{unveiled}} a $4-million training facility, using simulators and virtual reality, at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport on Ford Island. The Fleet Integrated Synthetic Training/Testing Facility (FIST2FAC) {{was developed to}} save on training costs with a <b>reusable</b> facility which could emulate electronic, mine and anti-air warfare scenarios instead of real-world training requiring fuel, logistics and deployment costs for ships.|$|E
5|$|The Space Shuttle {{became the}} {{major focus of}} NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Planned as a {{frequently}} launchable and mostly <b>reusable</b> vehicle, four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985. The first to launch, Columbia, did so on April 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the first known human space flight.|$|E
5|$|The bow {{section of}} Timothy Bloodworth, {{like that of}} all Liberty ships, was {{reinforced}} with concrete for strength. During the scrapping process, however, these sections were not <b>reusable.</b> Timothy Bloodworths bow section was one of nearly 150 buried in the private Liberty Ship Memorial Park {{on the banks of}} Portland's Willamette River. In 2006, the park was razed when the land was sold for commercial development.|$|E
5|$|Under his term, the {{environment}} of the city greatly improved. Hsu started a program of having the city's garbage trucks ring out brief English lessons in 2002. He promoted the use of eco-friendly chopsticks by requiring government officials and teachers to use their own <b>reusable</b> chopsticks when dining, expressing that the goal of the campaign is to reduce the use of disposable chopsticks by 100,000 pairs per day.|$|E
5|$|After each flight {{the engines}} would {{be removed from}} the orbiter and {{transferred}} to the Space Shuttle Main Engine Processing Facility (SSMEPF), where they would be inspected and refurbished in preparation for reuse on a subsequent flight. A total of 46 <b>reusable</b> RS-25 engines, each costing around US$40 million, were flown during the Space Shuttle program, with each new or overhauled engine entering the flight inventory requiring flight qualification on one of the test stands at Stennis Space Center prior to flight.|$|E
5|$|From 1962 to 1965, Halvorsen {{served in}} Wiesbaden, West Germany, with the Foreign Technology {{division}} of AF Systems Command. He was next {{assigned to the}} Deputy Chief of Staff for Research and Development, HQ USAF, the Pentagon, and in the Directorate of Space and Technology. He developed plans for the advanced manned <b>reusable</b> spacecraft, space policy and procedures, and on the Manned Orbital Laboratory Project. He then was given the command of the 659th Instrumentation Squadron of the AF Systems Command Satellite Control Facility, Vandenberg AFB, California, which was involved in both satellite launch and orbit operations.|$|E
5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a <b>reusable</b> liquid rocket booster for Ariane 5 in order to {{significantly}} reduce a high cost of space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E
5|$|The OSO and OAO {{missions}} {{demonstrated the}} important role space-based observations could play in astronomy, and in 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based reflecting telescope with a mirror 3m in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasized the need for manned maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the <b>reusable</b> space shuttle indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available.|$|E
5|$|The Senior Prom {{vehicle was}} {{intended}} to be expendable; however, it was modified to be <b>reusable</b> before testing commenced, with a ballistic parachute and inflatable landing bag located under the fuselage. The aircraft {{is believed to have been}} fitted with folding wings to facilicate carriage by the launching aircraft, and was powered by a single turbofan engine, with the air intake and exhaust being configured in such a manner that the airframe would shield them from the ground, reducing the aircraft's radar and infrared signatures.|$|E
5|$|The Skylon is a fully <b>reusable</b> {{single stage}} to orbit (SSTO) vehicle, {{able to achieve}} orbit without staging, which is {{intended}} to be used principally as a <b>reusable</b> launch system. Proponents of the SSTO approach have often claimed that staging involves a number of inherent complications and problems due to complexity, such as being difficult or typically impossible to recover and reuse most elements, thus unavoidably incurring great expense to produce entirely new launch vehicles instead; therefore, they believe that SSTO designs hold the promise of providing a reduction to the high cost of space flights. Operationally, it is envisioned for the non-crewed Skylon to take off from a specially strengthened runway, gain altitude in a fashion akin to a conventional aeroplane and perform an ascent at very high speeds, in excess of five times the speed of sound (3,800 miles per hour), to attain a peak altitude of roughly 92,000 feet, on the edge of low earth orbit (LEO), where payloads would typically be launched prior to the vehicle's re-entry into the atmosphere, upon which it will conduct a relatively gentle descent before performing a traditional landing upon a runway.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 1970, when NASA {{released}} {{a request for}} proposal for 'Phase B' main engine concept studies, requiring development of a throttleable, staged combustion, de Laval-type engine. The request {{was based on the}} then-current design of the Space Shuttle which featured two <b>reusable</b> stages, the orbiter and a manned fly-back booster, and required one engine which would be able to power both vehicles via two different nozzles (12 booster engines with 550,000lbf sea level thrust each and 3 orbiter engines with 632,000lbf vacuum thrust each). Rocketdyne, P and Aerojet General were selected to receive funding although, given P's already-advanced development (demonstrating a working 350,000lbf concept engine during the year) and Aerojet General's prior experience in developing the 1,500,000lbf M-1 engine, Rocketdyne was forced to put a large amount of private money into the design process to allow the company to catch up to its competitors.|$|E
5|$|It is {{presented}} as a compilation of data collected by the humans about Pandora and the life on it, written by Maria Wilhelm and Dirk Mathison. HarperFestival also released Wilhelm's 48-page James Cameron's Avatar: The <b>Reusable</b> Scrapbook for children. The Art of Avatar was released on , 2009, by Abrams Books. The book features detailed production artwork from the film, including production sketches, illustrations by Lisa Fitzpatrick, and film stills. Producer Jon Landau wrote the foreword, Cameron wrote the epilogue, and director Peter Jackson wrote the preface. In , Abrams Books also released The Making of Avatar, a 272-page book that detailed the film's production process and contains over 500 color photographs and illustrations.|$|E
5|$|Movable type: The polymath {{scientist}} and official Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{was the first}} to describe the process of movable type printing in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. He attributed the innovation of <b>reusable</b> fired clay characters to a little-known artisan named Bi Sheng (990–1051). Bi had experimented with wooden type characters, but their use was not perfected until 1297 to 1298 with the model of the official Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333) of the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), who also arranged written characters by rhyme scheme on the surface of round table compartments. It was not until 1490 with the printed works of Hua Sui (1439–1513) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) that the Chinese perfected metal movable type characters, namely bronze. The Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) scholar Xu Zhiding of Tai'an, Shandong developed vitreous enamel movable type printing in 1718.|$|E
5|$|Reach {{features}} updated {{versions of}} old weapons, plus new weapons fulfilling various combat roles. In Halo 3, players can carry single-use equipment power-ups that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages. This system of single-use equipment is replaced in Reach by <b>reusable</b> and persistent armor abilities that remain with a character {{until they are}} replaced. The abilities are a jetpack; active camouflage; sprint; hologram, which creates a facsimile of the player running towards a target point; drop shield, which creates a bubble that heals those inside and protects them from {{a limited amount of}} damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility for a brief period of time. When playing as Covenant Elites, players also have access to an evade armor ability.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{hourglass}} {{was one of}} the few reliable {{methods of}} measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting Allegory of Good Government, by Ambrogio Lorenzetti, from 1338. From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, <b>reusable,</b> reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices. The hourglass also took on symbolic meanings, such as that of death, temperance, opportunity, and Father Time, usually represented as a bearded, old man. Though also used in China, the hourglass's history there is unknown. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan used 18 hourglasses on each ship during his circumnavigation of the globe in 1522.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{it being}} a simpler project due to the {{original}} art being <b>reusable</b> {{turned out to be}} untrue: because so much time had passed since the original's release, there were multiple parts that had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating a whole new game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects were changed, and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements were changed, the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it being perceived as illogical that a person with a sword would be weaker than a person fighting with her bare hands.|$|E

25|$|<b>Reusable</b> {{products}} {{need to be}} {{more durable}} than single-use products, and hence require more material per item. This is particularly significant if only a small proportion of the <b>reusable</b> products are in fact reused.|$|E
25|$|Related to reuse: If a {{deliverable}} is <b>reusable</b> {{in multiple}} situations {{and another that}} is related to it is not, than {{it would make sense}} to produce the <b>reusable</b> deliverable first, because of its wider uses.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor in}} <b>reusable</b> cloth diaper impact {{is the ability}} to re-use the diapers for {{subsequent}} children or sell them on. These factors can alleviate the environmental and financial impact from manufacture, sale and use of brand-new <b>reusable</b> diapers.|$|E

25|$|Mueller held {{a one-day}} {{symposium}} (held at NASA headquarters) in December 1967 to which 80 {{people from the}} Air Force, NASA and industry were invited to discuss low cost space flight and shuttle-like designs. The designs ranged from 'simple' concepts like Martin Marietta's six person <b>reusable</b> craft similar to the Dyna-Soar (launched by a Titan III-M), to partially <b>reusable</b> concepts like Lockheed's Star Clipper or Tip Tank from McDonnell Douglas, to fully <b>reusable</b> two-stage vehicles like the one proposed by General Dynamics.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet <b>reusable</b> space-craft {{programme}} has {{its roots}} in the very beginning of the space age, the late 1950s.
