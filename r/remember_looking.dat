500|$|Pilou Asbæk, who {{was cast}} to play Euron Greyjoy, spoke in an {{interview}} about the filming of the Kingsmoot saying [...] "We spent two days on the Kingsmoot itself, and then two days on the montage. We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{aspect of}} Chrissie's {{personality}} is her wardrobe and style, with EastEnders costume designer Di Humphreys noting that [...] "Chrissie's clothes reflect her strong, upfront character." [...] According to Oberman the production team was keen to emphasise {{this in the}} manner of her dress: [...] "For Chrissie's wardrobe, we decided she is dressy and over co-ordinated", explaining how the character's fashion sense was informed by her own observations of British expatriates: [...] "When I heard I had the part of Chrissie I was on holiday in Spain, where she had been living, and I <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at all the ex-pat women, and thinking how co-ordinated they are. Their hair is always perfect, their bags match their gloves and shoes and scarves." [...] The show's make-up artist, Elizabeth Armistead, has also spoken of the way Chrissie's [...] "glamorous, polished look" [...] informs her characterisation and personality: [...] "Chrissie's a confident person who rarely leaves anything to chance. Even in moments of despair, though her facial expression reflects her turmoil, she never has a hair out of place." [...] The look was part of a desire to represent the character as a [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "forceful" [...] figure, with one interviewer describing Chrissie as [...] "quite flashy" [...] and [...] "glam". According to Humprehys this is manifested in [...] "Chrissie’s outfits, [...] are a mixture of designer and High Street... Chrissie's got a great sense of style. She makes High Street clothes look made to measure." [...] Oberman felt Chrissie's fashion sensibilities to be a critical element of the character: [...] "she's like Angie with 15 more years of Sex and The City thrown in", referring to an American televisied serial notable for fashion. Even before stepping foot on set Oberman spent eight hours with Humphreys shopping for Chrissie's clothes at Selfridges where they [...] "spent a fortune!" [...] The character's highly stylised representation on-screen earned Oberman the award for best-dressed soap star in 2005, and reflected Chrissie's new-found role as the [...] "voluptuous landlady" [...] of The Queen Vic. In the media the character was widely regarded as the show's ultimate femme fatale and resident [...] "sex symbol", being described by John Dingwall of the Daily Record as Walford's [...] "black widow".|$|E
2500|$|Every {{level in}} the game was {{designed}} primarily by a different level designer, which is why every level looks and feels so different from all the rest. To ensure Kurt and the enemies in the game moved as realistically as possible, their movements were created using motion capture, a relatively new technology in video game development at the time. Unlike previous motion capture games, however, the motion scripts for individual limbs were split up, allowing the developers to mix and match them and thus build {{a greater variety of}} animations. In terms of designing the character of Kurt, the most important aspect was ensuring a smooth transition from the third-person mode to the sniper mode. This was when the developers decided to make Kurt's sniper rifle the same gun as his machine gun; rather than having to stop and extract a new weapon when switching modes, Kurt simply attaches the gun to his helmet. This also made sense within the milieu of the game as it made Kurt's Coil Suit a completely self-contained one-gun offensive/defensive ensemble. In designing the suit, Bruty stated [...] "At the time most of the other action games out there were very clunky and hardcore-looking. I wanted something with more flair and elegance. I <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at a lot of old Spanish armour for the decoration and flourish." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Late Night host David Letterman was {{preparing}} to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels {{to search for a}} new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce. He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers. Wolodarksky recalled the experience: [...] "Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only dream up that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening." [...] The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993. As the writers headed to the voice record for [...] "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien {{received a phone call from}} Polone informing him of the decision. [...] "He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet," [...] recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|Of my {{childhood}} in this Olaf life I can regain but little. There come to me, however, recollections of a house, {{surrounded by a}} moat, situated in a great plain near to seas or inland lakes, on which plain stood mounds that I connected with the dead. What the dead were I did not quite understand, but I gathered that they were people who, having once walked about and been awake, now laid themselves down in a bed of earth and slept. I <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at a big mound which was said to cover a chief known as [...] "The Wanderer," [...] whom Freydisa, the wise woman, my nurse, told me had lived {{hundreds or thousands of}} years before, and thinking that so much earth over him must make him very hot at nights.|$|E
60|$|It was wintry weather--not such a November winter's day {{as some of}} us may <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at {{fourteen}} years ago, in Baregrove Square, but a brisk frosty morning in January. The country view visible from the back windows of Mr. Blyth's house, which stood on the extreme limit of the new suburb, was thinly and brightly dressed out for the sun's morning levee, in its finest raiment of pure snow. The cold blue sky was cloudless; every sound out of doors fell on the ear with a hearty and jocund ring; all newly-lit fires burnt up brightly and willingly without coaxing; and the robin-redbreasts hopped about expectantly on balconies and windowsills, as if they only waited for an invitation to walk in and warm themselves, along with their larger fellow creatures, round the kindly hearth.|$|E

60|$|One of Joan's {{earliest}} recollections was {{the picture}} of herself standing before the high cheval glass in her mother's dressing-room. Her clothes lay scattered far and wide, falling where she had flung them; not a shred {{of any kind of}} covering was left to her. She must have been very small, for she could <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> up and seeing high above her head the two brass knobs by which the glass was fastened to its frame. Suddenly, out of the upper portion of the glass, there looked a scared red face. It hovered there a moment, and over it in swift succession there passed the expressions, first of petrified amazement, secondly of shocked indignation, and thirdly of righteous wrath. And then it swooped down upon her, and the image in the glass became a confusion of small naked arms and legs mingled with green cotton gloves and purple bonnet strings.|$|E
60|$|All {{was work}} {{with us on the}} instant. While the wagons were being dragged and chained into the circle with tongues inside--I saw women and little boys and girls flinging their {{strength}} on the wheel spokes to help--we took toll of our losses. First, and gravest of all, our last animal had been run off. Next, lying about the fires they had been building, were seven of our men. Four were dead, and three were dying. Other men, wounded, were being cared for by the women. Little Rish Hardacre had been struck in the arm by a heavy ball. He was no more than six, and I <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> on with mouth agape while his mother held him on her lap and his father set about bandaging the wound. Little Rish had stopped crying. I could see the tears on his cheeks while he stared wonderingly at a sliver of broken bone sticking out of his forearm.|$|E
60|$|It was at {{the corner}} of the house, I <b>remember,</b> <b>looking</b> two ways. On one side to a stable-yard open to a by-road, where the ostlers were unharnessing the splashed and tired horses from the muddy carriage, and beyond that to the by-road itself, across which the sign was heavily swinging; on the other side to a wood of dark pine-trees. Their {{branches}} were encumbered with snow, and it silently dropped off in wet heaps while I stood at the window. Night was setting in, and its bleakness was enhanced by the contrast of the pictured fire glowing and gleaming in the window-pane. As I looked among the stems of the trees and followed the discoloured marks in the snow where the thaw was sinking into it and undermining it, I thought of the motherly face brightly set off by daughters that had just now welcomed me and of MY mother lying down in such a wood to die.|$|E

I <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> in the glass, and wondering at my own gray hair, and the wrinkles, many and deep, right across my brow, and the furrows down my cheeks, and the prodigious trampling of crow's-feet about my temples!

6000|$|I {{made one}} of those remarks ordinarily called [...] "smart things" [...] before that, {{but it was not}} a pun. Still, it came near causing a serious rupture between my father and myself.

I was lying there trying some India-rubber rings of various patterns, and endeavoring to make a selection, for I was tired of trying to cut my teeth on people's fingers, and wanted to get hold of something that would enable me to hurry the thing through and get something else. Did you ever notice what a nuisance it was cutting your teeth on your nurse's finger, or how back-breaking and tiresome it was trying to cut them on your big toe? And did you never get out of patience and wish your teeth were in Jerico long before you got them half cut? To me it seems as if these things happened yesterday. And they did, to some children. But I digress. I was lying there trying the India-rubber rings.

60|$|The {{barriers}} being now withdrawn, {{we walked}} adown {{the length of}} the nave, which did not seem to me so dim and vast as the recollection which I have had of it since my visit of a year ago. But my pre-imaginations and my memories are both apt to play me false with all admirable things, and so create disappointments for me, while perhaps the thing itself is really far better than I imagine or remember it. We engaged an old man, one of the attendants pertaining to the cathedral, to be our guide, and he showed us first the stone screen in front of the choir, with its sculptured kings of England; and then the tombs in the north transept,-- one of a modern archbishop, and one of an ancient one, behind which the insane person who set fire to the church a few years ago hid himself at nightfall. Then our guide unlocked a side door, and led us into the chapter-house,--an octagonal hall, with a vaulted roof, a tessellated floor, and seven arched windows of old painted glass, the richest that I ever saw or imagined, each looking like an inestimable treasury of precious stories, with a gleam and glow even in the sullen light of this gray morning. What would they be with the sun shining through them! With all their brilliancy, moreover, they were as soft as rose-leaves. I never saw any piece of human architecture so beautiful as this chapter-house; at least, I thought so while I was looking at it, and think so still; and it owed its beauty in very great measure to the painted windows: I <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at these windows from the outside yesterday, and seeing nothing but an opaque old crust of conglomerated panes of glass; but now that gloomy mystery was radiantly solved.|$|E
