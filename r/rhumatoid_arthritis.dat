40|$|Background. - <b>Rhumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> (RA) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} joint disease. It appears to becaused {{by a combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. It may be accompanied by well-known extra-articular damage (e. g. lung, kidney, heart), while cutaneous involvement such asrheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis (RND) is much less frequent.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to ascertain the relation between Amavata vyadhi and C- reactive protein. The study was conducted after ethics committee approval and written consent from patients. A total of 30 patients in different age groups were the subjects for this study. Assessment was done with special scoring pattern for signs and symptoms to obtain the correctness in the disease condition. Fasting blood sample was collected for routine lab investigations along with CRP. Correlation test and chi-square test for trend are applied for statistical analysis. Total score of Amavata and CRP concentration are closely and positively associated. It was concluded that there is increase in CRP concentration when signs and symptoms of Amavata increases. Key words- Amavata, C reactive protein, <b>Rhumatoid</b> <b>arthritis...</b>|$|E
40|$|The general {{regimen of}} French {{healthcare}} (Régime général de l’assurance maladie) undertook a transversal study in 1994 using random selection with 2 % uniform stratification. The main {{objective was to}} measure the instantaneous “medico-social” prevalence of the thirty chronic diseases allowing exemption from patient co-payments (ALD 30). The overall sample, representative of all the ALD 30 diseases, was constituted by 66, 439 individuals. This study analysed a sample of 13, 145 mentally-ill patients {{in order to determine}} the prevalence of other somatic diseases also present and included in the list of disorders exempted from co-payments. In order to compare the prevalence of somatic disorders in the mentally-ill with that occurring in the overall population, the prevalence rates were age-adjusted. Diabetes, peripheral arterial diseases, high-blood pressure, severe respiratory failure and HIV infection are over-represented in the mentally-ill population. In contrast, the prevalence of <b>rhumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> and cancer are similar in the two populations (except for cancer in drug-addicts). We discuss a number of hypothesis for explaining the differences in prevalence of certain comorbities between mentally-ill patients and the overall population. Over-medicalization of the mentally-ill may explain an excess in the number of ALD 30 reported. This population, which is already exempt from making co-payments, may also under-report a concomittant, second disorder. Environmental and iatrogenic factors may also play a part in the morbid process. A reduction in their effects could improve the care given to mentally-ill patients...|$|E
