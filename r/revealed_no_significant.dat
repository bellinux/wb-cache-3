Boletus puniceus, originally described from Kunming (Yunnan, China) in 1948, and later transferred to Xerocomus in 1979 and Boletellus in 2002, was already suspected by E.J.H.

While the putative species could not be separated genetically, they showed some consistent differences in morphological characters. Nevertheless, only one character showed no overlap. Byrkjedal et al. conclude that T. finnmarchica should be considered a junior synonym of T. chalcogramma. These analyses also suggest that T. finnmarchica is a near relative of the Atlantic cod, and that both Alaska and Norway pollock should be moved to genus Gadus.|$|E

50|$|Seismo-electromagnetics {{are various}} {{electro-magnetic}} phenomena {{believed to be}} generated by tectonic forces acting on the earth's crust, and possibly associated with seismic activity such as earthquakes and volcanoes.

However, despite many studies, no form of seismo-electromagnetics {{has been shown to be}} effective for earthquake prediction. A key problem is that earthquakes themselves produce relatively weak electromagnetic phenomena, and the effects from any precursory phenomena are likely to be too weak to measure. Close monitoring of the Parkfield earthquake <b>revealed</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> pre-seismic electromagnetic effects. However, some researchers remain optimistic, and searches for seismo-electromagnetic earthquake precursors continue.|$|E

In a cohort of patients in Korea who received S. boulardii for 4 weeks during and after a 1-week course of standard triple therapy, eradication rates were 10% higher than for those who did not receive the supplement.

Both the person with schziophrenia and their first degree healthy relatives have smaller gray matter volume than the second degree healthy relatives. It appears that genes are responsible for the decreased volume of gray matter in people with schizophrenia. Fujiwara et al. (2007) did an experiment in which they correlated the size of anterior cingulate gyrus in people with schizophrenia with their functioning on social cognition, psychopathology and emotions with control group. The smaller the size of anterior cingulate gyrus, the lower was the level of social functioning and the higher was the psychopathology in the people with schizophrenia. The anterior cingulate gyrus was found to be bilaterally smaller in people with schizophrenia as compared with control group. No difference in IQ tests and basic visuoperceptual ability with facial stimuli was found between people with schizophrenia and the control.|$|E
5000|$|These {{studies have}} {{indicated}} the dominant Y-DNA haplogroup I, and specifically its sub-haplogroup I2 found in Bosniaks, {{to be associated with}} paleolithic settlers as attributed to the ancient populations that expanded into the Balkans following the Last Glacial Maximum some 21,000 years ago. Peričić et al. for instance places its expansion to have occurred [...] "not earlier than the YD to Holocene transition and not later than the early Neolithic". Decidedly, the Slavic population can be divided into two genetically distinct groups: one encompassing all Western-Slavic (Poles, Slovaks etc.), Eastern-Slavic (Russians, Ukrainians etc.), and a few Southern-Slavic populations (north-western Croats and Slovenes), characterized by Haplogroup R1a, and one encompassing all remaining Southern Slavs (including Bosniaks), characterized by Haplogroup I2a2 (I-L69.2). According to Rebała et al., this phenomenon is explained by [...] "contribution of the Y chromosomes of peoples who settled in the region before the Slavic expansion to the genetic heritage of Southern Slavs."Studies based on bi-allelic markers of the NRY (non-recombining region of the Y-chromosome) have shown the three main ethnic groups of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats) to share, in spite of some quantitative differences, a large fraction of the same ancient gene pool distinct for the region.
