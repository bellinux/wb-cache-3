50|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} to iTunes {{two days in}} advance of its physical release, which led to it entering the chart at #35 on the week ending 16 May 2013. However, on the next week it rose to #2, with total sales of 44,500. The album lost in a well-publicized chart battle to the new album of Vanessa Paradis, which charted at #1 with sales of 48,900. The initial performance of <b>Recto</b> <b>Verso</b> was considered disappointing following Zaz, which spent eight weeks at #1. However, <b>Recto</b> <b>Verso</b> went on to spend ten weeks in the top 10 albums and has been certified Double Platinum, with estimated sales of 360,000 as of December 2013.|$|E
50|$|In codicology, each {{physical}} sheet (folium, abbreviated fol. or f.) of {{a manuscript}} is numbered and the sides {{are referred to}} as rectum and folium versum, abbreviated as r and v respectively. Editions of manuscripts will thus mark the position of text in the original manuscript in the form fol. 1r, sometimes with the r and v in superscript, as in 1r, or with a superscript o indicating the ablative <b>recto,</b> <b>verso,</b> as in 1ro. This terminology has been standard since the beginnings of modern codicology in the 17th century.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Recto</b> <b>Verso</b> is {{the second}} studio album by French singer Zaz, {{released}} on 10 May 2013 under the label Play On. The album was Zaz's first album in three years, after her eponymous début, released in 2010. It débuted on the French Album Chart at #2 and to date has spawned three singles, [...] "On ira", [...] "Si" [...] and [...] "Gamine". Musically, it is largely in a similar style to Zaz's début album. The title refers to {{the two sides of}} Zaz's personality, which she wished to express in the music of the album.|$|E
5000|$|Honda's work in both {{visual art}} and film deals {{specifically}} with materials and their intended and incidental purposes, an interest she attributes {{in part to}} her academic studies in material culture. Asked about <b>Recto</b> <b>Verso,</b> an installation at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 1994, in which visitors were required to step over objects, climb a ladder, and place their hands in holes they could not see into, she said, [...] "The seduction is there in the materials themselves and in your expectations of what you're going to find, how you think {{something is going to}} operate." ...|$|E
5000|$|The terms recto and verso {{refer to}} the text written on the [...] "front" [...] and [...] "back" [...] sides of a leaf of paper in a bound item such as a codex, book, broadsheet, or pamphlet. The terms are {{shortened}} from Latin rectō foliō and versō foliō, translating to [...] "on the upright side of the page" [...] and [...] "on the turned side of the page", respectively.The page faces themselves are called folium rectum and folium versum in Latin, and the ablative <b>recto,</b> <b>verso</b> already imply that the text on the page (and not the physical page itself) are referred to.|$|E
30|$|Several {{approaches}} for see-through reduction have been investigated, mainly for grayscale documents, and exploiting {{the availability of}} pre-registered scans of both sides (<b>recto</b> and <b>verso).</b>|$|R
25|$|Note: Pozdniakov {{includes}} B in {{his comments}} on the reading order of A, suggesting that the sides of B should be assigned labels a and b rather than <b>recto</b> and <b>verso.</b>|$|R
25|$|The initial {{letters are}} decorated; some of decorations are zoomorphic (birds, fishes), {{anthropomorphic}} (hands), and other motifs. The most significant or interesting images are on folio 25 <b>recto,</b> 96 <b>verso,</b> 114 verso.|$|R
50|$|Paradis left Paris for {{the south}} of France in 2013 {{to work on their}} first album. It was {{originally}} set for sometime in spring 2015 but the release date was pushed back to give the record time to mature. The album is the first recorded by the duo and will be their second release after their new EP with French label Barclay. The album, titled <b>Recto</b> <b>Verso,</b> was released in September 2016. The album retains Paradis' core elements, merging pop music with the textures of contemporary dance music whilst adding their own melodies and synths to each track. The album contains 12 tracks. The duo confirmed that there are no collaborative appearances on the record, however the recording and mastering stages of production were aided by Julien Delfaut and Antoine Chabert affiliated with Daft Punk.|$|E
5000|$|Honda's work often {{incorporates}} biographical {{content and}} reflections. <b>Recto</b> <b>Verso</b> draws on eye-strengthening exercises she {{did as a}} child to correct a problem with her vision. In Sift, an early work shown in the 1992 show [...] "Relocations and Revisions: The Japanese-American Internment Reconsidered" [...] at the Long Beach Museum of Art, Honda addressed her own understanding of the effects that internment had on members of her family. More recently, her 2015 installation at Triangle France, titled Sculptures, recreated to scale all 15 of the artist studios she maintained {{over the course of}} her career. Writing in Mousse Magazine, Tenzing Barshee notes that, in keeping with Honda's [...] "nonlinear and atemporal approach to history," [...] her use of biographical elements [...] "does not stem from a project of nostalgia but rather from an active engagement with historicity, continuously interweaving different points in time to produce work infused with the present." ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecto verso {{registration}} {{is an important}} step allowing detection of missing digitized pages, or location of the bleed-through defect over a page. An efficient way to restore or evaluate the bleed-through of a digitized document consists in analyzing at the same time both the recto side and the verso side. This method requires the two images to be aligned, registered. Without particular knowledge about document, <b>recto</b> <b>verso</b> {{registration is}} complex. Indeed, the only information that we can use to register the two is the bleed-through. <b>Recto</b> <b>verso</b> registration is complex because the recto's bleed-through is a highly degraded version of verso's ink pixels. Therefore, in this particular context, usual image comparison methods are not very relevant. Nevertheless, document <b>recto</b> <b>verso</b> registration algorithms has been proposed, but these methods have impor- tant time computation costs, are noise sensitive and even fail in some cases where bleed-through is too light. The previous techniques are based on a pixel to pixel approach where the bleed-through is considered to be just a set of grey pixels. In this article, we consider the structure of the ink pixels on the verso page. The <b>recto</b> <b>verso</b> registration method presented here is {{based on the fact that}} bleed-through has the same structure that the ink on the verso side. The method registers the recto's bleed-through layout and the verso's ink layout, in two main steps, first a de-skewing algorithm is applied to both pages then, horizontal and vertical profiles are extracted and aligned with a dynamic time warping. The time complexity of our method is linear according to the image size. Moreover, experiments detailed at the end show the accuracy of our method...|$|E

30|$|Recently, the {{interest}} in applying blind source separation (BSS) algorithms for solving this problem has increased noticeably. The appearance of the degraded <b>recto</b> and <b>verso</b> scans is first modelled as a parametric superimposition of the uncorrupted <b>recto</b> and <b>verso</b> images, and then a separation algorithm is used to estimate both the mixing parameters and the ideal front and back side images (sources). The assumption of a linear instantaneous mixing model has led to BSS algorithms such as independent component analysis (ICA) [8, 9] or non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) [10]. Some works have also addressed more realistic nonlinear and/or convolutional mixing models, and separation algorithms based on image regularization [11 – 14].|$|R

30|$|A useful {{observation}} {{is that the}} 6 × 6 system of equations is separable into three independent 2 × 2 symmetric problems, which can be then solved separately. In this case, employing ICA to solve each subsystem only entails assuming independence of the recto and verso text at each individual channel, as done for the grayscale case, and no unrealistic uncorrelation is assumed among the various colour maps of the <b>recto</b> (<b>verso)</b> text. This allows reducing the interferences while preserving the original colour of the RGB recto and verso images [9]. However, some residual see-through interference usually remain in the reconstructions. Indeed, if no blur is accounted for, two homologous patterns in the two different sides cannot match exactly; on the other side, this could also indicate that the recto and verso text are actually correlated at each channel.|$|E
40|$|Sketchbooks {{are usually}} private and personal, a {{creative}} {{space in which}} thoughts and ideas are noted by artists, architects and designers. These inspirational first thoughts; embryonic artworks, buildings or products, offer a fascinating insight into the creative process. The exhibition features sketchbooks from contemporary artists Grayson Perry and Simon Faithful as well as historic sketchbooks from the Usher Gallery’s collections. The exhibition not only explores {{the way in which}} sketchbooks are used but tackles the challenge of exhibiting books; how can we view the pages? In the special ’Library zone’ {{you will be able to}} select, take off the shelf and browse through over 200 sketchbooks which have been loaned in response to an open invitation. Sketchbooks have been contributed by artists from all over the country and from the USA and Europe. The exhibition is curated by John Plowman. The exhibition will be accompanied by a two-day international conference entitled <b>Recto,</b> <b>Verso</b> at The Collection on 10 & 11 February 2011...|$|E

40|$|The current {{outcome is}} two sketchbooks {{included}} in a national peer reviewed exhibition of contemporary British Artists’ sketchbooks (38 artists, 42 sketchbooks selected) including full colour illustrated catalogue. My work is used on the website (see URL above). This output comes from research in artists working processes and the documentation, discussion and dissemination of these. The sketchbooks explore {{the nature of the}} book structure and the possibilities for drawing within that. The work has developed from research with scientists and inquiry into shared working procedures in certain sciences and art. This has resulted in new forms of drawing and new approaches to discussing it (e. g. {{from the perspective of the}} scientific experiment). One of four artists to have 2 books shortlisted for the only national prize for sketchbook drawing in the UK. Selected by high profile, internationally esteemed panel (i. e. Petherbridge). Rabley Drawing centre is engaged with disseminating and promoting contemporary drawing through projects such as the Sketch Drawing Prize which is to be a biannual event. It also hosts residencies and represents internationally renown artists: (e. g. Gillian Ayres, Humphrey Ocean, Emma Stibbon [...] ) [URL] The Exhibition and Conference at Lincoln was an international forum to explore innovative approaches to using or contextualising the sketchbook in contemporary practice. The work leading to these outputs has been developed and tested through earlier iterations in other national and international forums. This includes exhibition (The Moment of Privacy has Passed, Usher Gallery Lincoln 11 Dec 2010 – 6 March 2011) [URL]; and international conference papers : <b>Recto</b> <b>Verso,</b> Redefining the Sketchbook (The Collection, Lincoln, UK 10 - 11 Feb 2011); The European Association for Science Studies annual conference (Trento University, Italy 2 - 4 th Sept 2010).
