50|$|However, lack {{of certain}} key {{technology}} such as reliable remote {{video and audio}} communication, {{and a lack of}} widespread stable high-bandwidth Internet access, prevented these early efforts from including a significant live component in their offering. Early innovations came from remote language learning services such as italki, where a stable audio connection was sufficient to deliver a reasonable service. In most contexts, online tutoring was thus fundamentally different from face-to-face tutoring, more closely resembling correspondence teaching than sitting in a classroom. Today, there are hundreds of companies and academic institutions based around the world offering live <b>remote</b> <b>learning</b> in a huge range of subjects, both in the context of academic learning and industrial training.
