She met with Saldivar, who delayed the {{transfer}} of papers with a story about having been raped in Mexico. Selena took Saldivar to a local hospital, where doctors {{found no evidence of}} rape. When they returned to the motel room, Selena ended their four-year working relationship. As she turned to leave, Saldivar <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> handbag, pulled out a Taurus Model 85 [...]38 caliber revolver, pointed it at Selena and pulled the trigger. The bullet entered Selena's right shoulder blade from the back, piercing a major artery running from her heart and exiting from just below her right collarbone. She ran to the motel lobby and collapsed to the floor. As the motel employees gathered round, she named Saldivar as her assailant. Selena was transferred to a nearby hospital, where doctors found the damage irreparable. She was pronounced dead within the hour.|$|E

Twenty-six-year-old Fromme was positioned [...] from Ford, behind the first row of the crowd, and <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> flowing red robe, drawing the Colt [...]45 pistol from her leg holster.

When Melby appeared before the department's Loyalty Security Board, he was not allowed to contest Hellman's Communist Party affiliation or learn who informed against her, but only to present his understanding of her politics and the nature of his relationship with her, including the occasional renewal of their physical relationship. He said he had no plans to renew their friendship, but never promised to avoid contact with her.|$|E

Socialism <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> mind, to be rejected. She had never understood it clearly, but it seemed to her a state of mind where dissatisfied men and women wanted to share what harder working or more gifted people possessed. There were a few who had too much of the world's goods and many who had too little. A readjustment of such inequality and injustice must come, but Carley did not see the remedy in Socialism.|$|E

60|$|And {{with one}} hand he caught her scarf and drew it tightly around her {{shoulders}} so that the centipede could not fall inside her bodice. With the other hand--the right--he <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> hair, caught the repulsive abomination as near as he was able by the nape of the neck, and held it tightly between thumb and forefinger as he withdrew it from her hair. It was as horrible and heroic a sight as man could wish to see. It made my flesh crawl. The centipede, seven inches of squirming legs, writhed and twisted and dashed itself about his hand, the body twining around the fingers and the legs digging into the skin and scratching as the beast endeavoured to free itself. It bit him twice--I saw it--though he assured the ladies {{that he was not}} harmed as he dropped it upon the walk and stamped it into the gravel. But I saw him in the surgery five minutes afterwards, with Doctor Goodhue scarifying the wounds and injecting permanganate of potash. The next morning Kersdale's arm was as big as a barrel, and it was three weeks before the swelling went down.|$|E

I presently discovered that the family treasury contained still another feature--a jewel of some sort, apparently--and that she was trying to get around speaking squarely about it, lest I get paralysed again. But I wanted to known about that thing, too, and urged her to tell me what it was. She was afraid. But I insisted, and said I would brace myself this time and be prepared, then the shock would not hurt me. She was full of misgivings, but the temptation to reveal that marvel to me and enjoy my astonishment and admiration was too strong for her, and she confessed that she had it on her person, and said that if I was sure I was prepared--and so on and so on--and with that she <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> bosom and brought out a battered square of brass, watching my eye anxiously the while. I fell over against her in a quite well-acted faint, which delighted her heart and nearly frightened it out of her, too, at the same time. When I came to and got calm, she was eager to know what I thought of her jewel.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I will {{demonstrate}} that Eleanor Dark's over-riding themes are time and memory. Time informs {{the structure of}} her novels, she juxtaposes past and present. Memory in all its aspects, personal, cultural, racial dominates both her contemporary novels and The Timeless Land trilogy. The thesis considers Dark's fiction in sequence to chart her treatment of time and memory. Simultaneously Dark was <b>reaching</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own reservoir ofmemory and transfiguring her own experience in the characters, events and locations of her novels. In this oblique way, and through this unique form of modelling, Dark reveals little known areas of her life. Biographically Dark remains elusive; the surface events of her life are well documented but do {{not account for the}} drama of her character portrayals, the immediacy of her perceptions of the natural world, her deep intellectual responses to art, literature and politics, as well as her preoccupation with time. It is my contention that Dark's creative thrust was inwards; she developed the inner processes of memory and imagination. Time and memory cohere in her novels; under scrutiny they bring new interpretations to her work, and new insights <b>into</b> <b>her</b> life...|$|R

50|$|House recalls that, {{during the}} bus ride, Amber sneezed, {{reached for a}} Kleenex, and complained {{that she had the}} flu. He then recalls what caused his concern; after she wiped her nose, she <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> purse and pulled out {{prescription}} pills, {{which turned out to be}} amantadine. She took a heavy dose of two or three amantadine pills, right as the garbage truck plowed into the bus. The crash caused such extensive anatomical and physiological trauma (especially the blood loss and shock from her leg injury) that she ended up suffering from acute renal failure. This damage to her kidneys made them unable to adequately filter out the amantadine, causing her to overdose and thus causing all of her unexplained symptoms. Wilson suggests dialysis as a treatment, but House tells him during the memory of the moments leading up to the bus crash that unfiltered amantadine binds to proteins in the kidneys and therefore dialysis is unable to clear it from the blood. Ultimately, there is no treatment for Amber. House and Wilson begin to cry, and House goes into a seizure while still connected to the deep brain stimulation equipment. The seizure makes the equipment shift, causing House's brain to bleed, leading to him falling into a coma.|$|E

He claimed they had reconciled, were planning on moving back in together and had daily discussions about getting married and having children. On the night of October 30, Sweeney said that Dunne had abruptly changed her mind about a reconciliation and told him that she had been lying to him about getting back together and had been leading him on. At that point, Sweeney said he [...] "just exploded and lunged toward her."
