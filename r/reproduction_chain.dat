40|$|Serial {{reproduction}} {{reveals how}} information changes when communicated through a social network. Studies using it find {{that information is}} transformed to fit cultural norms, expectations, stereotypes, (e. g., Bartlett, 1932) audience attitudes (Higgins & Rholes, 1978); and simplified and polarized (e. g., Gilovich, 1987). Information content {{and the relationship between}} conversers also influences information spread (Granovetter, 1973; Hanson, 1999). Serial reproduction methodology could improve understanding of complex information flow in organizations. Knowledge is now the most important strategic resource in organizations, and its management is critical to organizational success (Ipe, 2003). Research using grapevine or similar methodology with verbal information spread in organizations (Bordia & Rosnow, 1998; Davis, O’Connor & Regis, 1976) has examined factors like the timing and extent of information spread and information change. In contrast, serial reproduction follows written information through a chain of people, recording how information changes in each step of a communication chain. It can be more or less structured, allowing for natural communication, or the creation of predetermined communication lines (simulating organizational lines of communication). Thus one can examine, control for or manipulate relationships and information. We present serial reproduction methodology and sample research, examining how stereotypical information changes depending on communicators’ relationship. Four-member serial <b>reproduction</b> <b>chains</b> were created, manipulating the relationship between the participants. Initial participants read a story created by the researchers including information varying in stereotypicality and complexity. After a distractor task participants recreated the story for the next participant. Each succeeding participant received the story written by the previous participant.

5000|$|The term [...] "binaural" [...] has {{frequently}} been confused as {{a synonym for}} the word [...] "stereo", and this is partially due to {{a large amount of}} misuse in the mid-1950s by the recording industry, as a marketing buzzword. Conventional stereo recordings do not factor in natural ear spacing or [...] "head shadow" [...] of the head and ears, since these things happen naturally as a person listens, generating their own ITDs (interaural time differences) and ILDs (interaural level differences). Because loudspeaker-crosstalk of conventional stereo interferes with binaural reproduction, either headphones are required, or crosstalk cancellation of signals intended for loudspeakers such as Ambiophonics is required. For listening using conventional speaker-stereo, or mp3 players, a pinna-less dummy head may be preferable for quasi-binaural recording, such as the sphere microphone or Ambiophone.

40|$|Cultural {{transmission}} {{theory and}} methods {{focus on the}} qualities of cultural artefacts (e. g. religious beliefs, supernatural ideas, folk stories) to understand how and why some spread and last better than others. This epidemiological approach {{is part of a}} broader project, cognition and culture, which seeks to understand links between mind and culture. Cognition and culture is concerned with universal, recurrent cultural phenomena, whose developmental acquisition and patterns of distribution and variation may be linked to innate mental competencies. Anthropologists, ethno- and cognitive linguists, and cognitive and developmental psychologists have established that metaphor exhibits exactly these characteristics—universality, cultural variation, and developmental acquisition patterns. Yet, the cultural transmission of metaphor has not been addressed in the cognition and culture literature. This thesis proposes a novel application of an epidemiological account of cultural transmission to small-scale, linguistic, cultural artefacts—everyday, sensorimotor metaphorical talk about knowledge, learning, and understanding. Serial reproduction tasks, experiments, interviews, and metaphor analysis were used in a mixed-methods approach to investigate the use and transmission of metaphorical language. Three initial experimental studies, which aimed to investigate transmission advantages of metaphor, showed no statistically significant effects of metaphor on transmission fidelity of short stories across serial <b>reproduction</b> <b>chains.</b> Four further studies were conducted to follow up on these findings. Results of the first follow-up experiment, more sensitive to the agency of speakers in communicative exchange, indicated that metaphorical prompts to invent stories yielded more metaphors in the story endings and descriptions. Findings from experimental and conversation-based judgement tasks suggested that metaphorical language provided more inferential potential than non-metaphorical language to support assessments of the verbal material and inferences about the speaker. The final qualitative study revealed ways that metaphor is used to support social interaction and co-operation in more naturalistic conversation contexts. Overall, it was found that social and pragmatic aspects of communication, undetectable in traditional serial reproduction experiments, contribute significantly to the wide distribution, or cultural success, of metaphor. An account of the cultural success of metaphor based in inferential processes that support social interaction is proposed. Reflections are offered on its theoretical and methodological implications for the epidemiological view of cultural transmission and its generalisability to different types of cultural artefacts...|$|R

In mathematics, integro-difference/differential equations or reaction-diffusion equations are often used to describe different spatial spread/invasion phenomena. In this thesis, we investigate the global dynamic of some integro-difference and reaction-diffusion population models with spatial dispersal and temporal heterogeneities. [...] In Chapter 1, we present some basic terminologies and theorems which are used in this thesis. They are involved in monotone dynamics, spreading speeds and traveling waves, basic <b>reproduction</b> ratio, and <b>chain</b> transitive sets. [...] Chapter 2 is devoted to investigate the spatial dynamics for a class of discrete-time recursion systems, which describe the spatial propagation of two competitive invaders. The existence and global stability of bistable traveling waves are established for such systems under appropriate conditions. [...] In Chapter 3, we study spreading speeds and traveling waves for a class of reaction-diffusion equations with distributed delay. Such an equation describes growth and diffusion in a population where the individuals enter a quiescent phase exponentially and stay quiescent for some arbitrary time that is given by a probability density function. The existence of the spreading speed and its coincidence with the minimum wave speed of monostable traveling waves are established via the finite-delay approximation approach. We also prove the existence of bistable traveling waves in the case where the associated reaction system admits a bistable structure. Moreover, the global stability and uniqueness of the bistable waves are obtained in the case where the density function has zero tail. [...] In Chapter 4, we investigate a periodic reaction-diffusion competition model, which describes the propagation of two competitive species in bad and good seasons. The existence and global stability of time-periodic bistable traveling waves are established for such a system under appropriate conditions.

40|$|As stated at {{the start}} of this article, {{psychological}} and physical demand states can be understood as the effects and consequences caused by loads. To deduce the physiological characteristics of psychophysical demand, theoretical concepts like the load/demand concept are commonly used as a basis. Since demand itself is not directly quantifiable, reference must be made to demand indicators. This means measurement regulations determine what we define as psychophysical demand. The experiment described in this article falls under the category of mental (cognitive) demand that assumes knowledge exists about a dance choreography {{in the case of the}} persons being tested. This knowledge includes in particular, as well as conscious sense perceptions about events in the external world and one’s own body, mental activities such as thinking, imagining and remembering using emotional and motivational powers. These accentuate the focus for conscious actions. Particularly for the processes of thinking and remembering, attention increases concrete states of consciousness, which also manifest themselves in an increase in electrical activity of neurons in the  frequencies. These phenomena could be discerned in all dancers and manifested themselves in similar ways. The states of consciousness are regenerated in the close interplay between cortical and limbic structures and are ultimately dependent on the function of the neuron collections. These functions are not only affected by external excitement, but also excite one another and combine with other cognitive excitement patterns such as memories, sensations, perceptions and imagination. At the same time, the neural states influence other vegetative functions such as heart, respiratory and muscle activities. In light of the question stated at the outset, the tendencies in the results confirm similar investigations proving that mental reproduction of motor actions affect all association areas of the cortex, despite the performance part of the action in the sense of its execution not being included. Since a large number of neural connections exist between the cortices, we can assume that the moment mental <b>reproduction</b> of a <b>chain</b> of actions takes place, such as a dance, a self-contained association area comes into being, in which the complex movement structures of the dance appear clearly in the form of increased beta activities. Furthermore, the increased neural activity due to mental concentration also leads, via the relevant vegetative connections, to a change in cardiac, respiratory and muscle activity. In this way, events experienced in the past can lead to similar mental and vegetative reactions such as exist under the actual conditions of a dance. As mental demand increases, the physiological reactions return to a lower level due to fatigue. The intensity of the reactions seems to depend on individual aspects of those taking part in the experiment however. Mental load situations cannot be stimulated and represented in isolation, they are further inextricably bound up with matters of a socio-emotional and energy-efficiency nature...|$|R

The LM 98640 QML has an adaptive power scaling feature to optimize power consumption based on the operating frequency and amount of gain required. High-speed signal throughput is achieved with an innovative architecture utilizing Correlated Double Sampling (CDS), typically employed with CCD arrays, or Sample and Hold (S/H) inputs (for Contact Image Sensors and CMOS image sensors). The sampling edges are programmable to a resolution of 1 / 64 th of a pixel period. Both the CDS and S/H have a programmable gain of either 0 dB or 6 dB. The signal paths utilize two ± 8 bit offset correction DACs for coarse and fine offset correction, and 8 bit Programmable Gain Amplifiers (PGA) for each channel. The PGA and offset DAC are programmed independently allowing unique values of gain and offset for each input. The signals are then routed to two on chip 14 -bit 40 MHz {{high performance}} analog-to-digital converters (ADC). The fully differential processing channel provides exceptional noise immunity, having a very low noise floor of- 79 dB with a gain of 1 x.

40|$|International audienceMany {{wildlife}} {{species may}} {{be exposed to}} biologically active concentrations of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. There is strong evidence obtained from laboratory studies showing the potential of several environmental chemicals to cause endocrine disruption at environmentally realistic exposure levels. In wildlife populations, associations have been reported between reproductive and developmental effects and endocrine-disrupting chemicals. In the aquatic environment, effects have been observed in mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and mollusks from Europe, North America, and other areas. The observed abnormalities vary from subtle changes to permanent alterations, including disturbed sex differentiation with feminized or masculinized sex organs, changed sexual behavior, and altered immune function. For most reported effects in wildlife, however, the evidence for a causal link with endocrine disruption is weak or nonexisting. Crucial in establishing causal evidence for chemical-induced wildlife effects appeared semifield or laboratory studies using the wildlife species of concern. Impaired reproduction and development causally linked to endocrine-disrupting chemicals are well documented {{in a number of}} species and have resulted in local or regional population changes. These include: Masculinization (imposex) in female marine snails by tributyltin, a biocide used in antifouling paints, is probably the dearest case of endocrine disruption caused by an environmental chemical. The dogwhelk is particularly sensitive, and imposer has resulted in decline or extinction of local populations worldwide, including coastal areas all over Europe and the open North Sea. DDE-induced egg-shell thinning in birds has caused severe population declines in a number of raptor species in Europe and North America. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals have adversely affected a variety of fish species. In the vicinity of certain sources (e. g., effluents of water treatment plants) and in the most contaminated areas is this exposure causally linked with the effects on reproductive organs that could have implications for fish populations. However, there is also a more widespread occurrence of endocrine disruption in fish in the U. K., where estrogenic effects have been demonstrated in freshwater systems, in estuaries, and in coastal areas. In mammals, the best evidence comes from the field studies on Baltic gray and ringed seals, and from the Dutch semifield studies on harbor seals, where both reproduction and immune functions have been impaired by PCBs in the food <b>chain.</b> <b>Reproduction</b> effects resulted in population declines, whereas impaired immune function has likely contributed to the mass mortalities due to morbillivirus infections. Distorted sex organ development and function in alligators has been related to a major pesticide spill Into a lake in Florida, U. S. A. The observed estrogenic/antiandrogenic effects in this reptile have been causally linked in experimental studies with alligator eggs to the DDT complex. Although most observed effects currently reported concern heavily polluted areas, endocrine disruption is a potential global problem. This is exemplified by the widespread occurrence of imposer in marine snails and the recent findings of high levels of persistent potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals in several marine mammalian species inhabiting oceanic water...|$|R
40|$|Pelagic tunicates, {{including}} salps, are {{an important}} category of gelatinous zooplankton and yet are relatively understudied. Salps regularly occur in intermittent swarms and can quickly become the most dominant zooplankton within an area. My thesis explores the trophic interactions of salps within the zooplankton community using stable isotope analysis, the environmental drivers of salp population dynamics, and the occurrence of salp deposition on the sea floor. The trophic niche of salps within the oceanic zooplankton community was investigated using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Zooplankton and suspended particulate organic matter (POM) were sampled in three different water types: inner shelf (IS), a cold core eddy (CCE; cyclonic) and a warm core eddy (WCE; anti-cyclonic). Recent upwelling in the IS water type resulted in lower than expected trophic enrichment for all zooplankton species (0. 53  compared to 3. 4 ), and the salp Thalia democratica was depleted in 15 N compared to POM. Trophic enrichment of zooplankton within the CCE (2. 74 ) was higher than the IS, and more similar to expected results (3. 4 ). Based on chlorophyll a and nitrate concentrations, the WCE was characterised as an oligotrophic environment and was {{associated with an increased}} trophic level for omnivorous zooplankton (copepods and euphausiids) to a similar level as carnivorous zooplankton (chaetognaths). This study shows that trophic relationships among the zooplankton are dynamic and can vary across water types. The demographic characteristics of three salp swarms were studied to examine factors influencing variations in salp swarm magnitude. The interannual abundance of Thalia democratica during spring was related to the rates of asexual <b>reproduction</b> (buds per <b>chain).</b> T. democratica abundance was significantly higher in October 2008 (1312 individuals m- 3) than 2009 and 2010 (210 and 92 individuals m&# 8722; 3, respectively). Salp abundance was negatively related to buds per chain and relative growth rates, implying a faster release rate. As T. democratica abundance was significantly positively related to food > 2 &# 956;m in size and negatively related to the proportion of non-salp zooplankton, salp swarm abundance may depend on the abundance of larger phytoplankton (prymnesiophytes and diatoms) and competition with other zooplankton. A discrete-time, size-structured Thalia democratica population model was developed to investigate the temporal resolution of a salp swarm. The model used size-dependent reproduction and mortality, where growth was dependent on food consumption (chlorophyll a biomass) and temperature. Average generation time (12 days) and mean abundances of each stage correspond to previously reported values. Salp ingestion rate and the doubling time of chlorophyll a were the most influential parameters, negatively influencing salp biomass and abundances for each individual stage. Forcing the model with a 10 -year temperature and chlorophyll a time-series identified that salp abundances off the coast of Sydney (34 ºS) were significantly greater during spring and summer compared to autumn and winter. This is consistent with observations of salp swarms which occur after the spring phytoplankton bloom. Salp swarm abundance appears {{to be related to the}} availability of food (chlorophyll a per salp) rather than absolute abundance (chlorophyll a biomass). Mass depositions of the large salp Thetys vagina were observed on the Tasman Sea floor in 2008 and 2009, prompting examination into the potential of salp carcasses to act as food fall events to the benthos. Over 1700 carcasses were identified on the sea floor and benthic fish and crustaceans were observed feeding on the carcasses. Analysis of a 30 -year trawl survey database determined that salp biomass (wet weight, WW) in the eastern Tasman Sea regularly exceeds 100 t km&# 8722; 3. T. vagina has a carbon (31 % dry weight, DW) and energy (11 kJ g&# 8722; 1 DW) content more similar to that of phytoplankton blooms, copepods and fish than to that of jellyfish (cnidarians), with which they are often grouped. Given their abundance, rapid export to the seabed and high nutritional value, salps are likely to be a significant input of carbon to pelagic and benthic food webs, which until now, has been largely overlooked...|$|R
40|$|Absorbing-state phase {{transitions}} are non-equilibrium phase transitions {{that can}} occur, for instance, in models describing {{the growth of}} bacterial colonies or the spreading of an infectious disease among a population. Despite {{the fact that this}} class of non-equilibrium critical phenomena has been investigated for several decades [1], it has been challenging to find experimental systems that unambiguously manifest it. The simplest system in which absorbing-state phase transitions occur is made of identical components, arranged in a lattice with fixed site distances, with two different internal states: an excited state, which is energetically unstable, and a ground state, which is stable. The particles of the system can change their state via two stochastic processes: the decay, a one-way process consisting in the particle going from the excited to the ground state, and the offspring reproduction, a two-way process where one particle is excited (or de-excited) only if there is a pre-existent excitation next to it. The particular nature of the excitation process implies that the ground state represents the absorbing-state of the system, a configuration that can be reached by the dynamics but cannot be left (like a sticky wall in a random walk process). The same particular nature of the excitation imposes to choose an initial state with at least one excitation to study the phase transition. The phase transition is observed varying the relative probability of the two processes. If decay dominates, the system will go towards the absorbing state. If offspring reproduction prevails, the system will reach a stationary state where there is a fixed number of excitations in the system that is dependent on the value of the ratio between the excitation and decay rates. With the two states established above, the system becomes critical at the transition point, where it exhibits long range correlation and is characterized by its scaling behaviours, specifically, the scaling exponents. To observe an absorbing-state phase transition using a gas of cold 87 Rb atoms, we need to replicate the peculiar nature of the excitation process. In our case, we satisfy these conditions using a Rydberg level as the excited state. Rydberg atoms have one or more electrons excited to high principal quantum number, showing exaggerated properties. They have long lifetimes, of the order 100 µs (for the state 70 S that we have employed) and interact strongly with each other due to of their large van der Waals interactions. This interaction energy, of the form C 6 /R^ 6, is responsible for the so-called dipole blockade, in which the creation of more than one Rydberg excitation within a certain radius is strongly suppressed (in our experiment the blockade radius is ~ 10 µm). However, if the excitation laser is off resonance with detuning Delta for an isolated atom, it is resonant for an atom that is in a shell of distance called facilitation radius R_fac=((C 6 * 2 *pi) /(h*Delta)) ^(1 / 6) from a Rydberg atom. This off-resonant excitation is called facilitation and is caused by the repulsive nature of the van der Waals interactions between Rydberg atoms in S state. The other process that has to be present in the system, the decay, is simply realized by the spontaneuos decay from the Rydberg level to the ground state of the atom. In addition to these processes, necessary to observe the absorbing-state phase transition, there is a third one: the atoms in the gas can be excited also {{in the absence of a}} nearby Rydberg atom. This spontaneous excitation is less likely to happen when the excitation laser is out of resonance but, especially for high values of the Rabi frequency of the excitation transition, the probability is not neglible. This extra process is responsible for the smoothing of the phase transition in our measurements. In our experimental apparatus, a 87 Rb atomic gas is cooled at T = 150 µK and confined within a 3 D Magneto Optical Trap (MOT). After being trapped, the atoms are excited to the Rydberg state 70 S by a two-step excitation process. The excitation lasers (responsible for the offspring reproduction) shine the atoms for a time much longer than the Rydberg lifetime. In this way we implement an open driven many-body quantum system, in which we observe a change of the global state of the system from the absorbing state to the blockaded state, varying the power of the excitation laser from 0 to the max. We explored two different geometries for the Rydberg excitation: a quasi- 1 D geometry, in which the offspring <b>reproduction</b> creates a <b>chain</b> of Rydberg atoms, or a 3 D configuration. The main experimental results reported in this thesis are in the quasi- 1 D configuration, for which Prof. Igor Lesanovsky and co-workers at the University of Nottingham developed a mean-field model and numerical simulations, taking into account also position disorder and atomic motion, two important features of the real system of cold Rydberg atoms we have experimentally studied.
