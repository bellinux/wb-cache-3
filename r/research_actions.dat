40|$|The book 'Action {{research}} and new media' by Greg Hearn, Jo Tacchi, Marcus Foth and June Lennie, breaks new {{ground in a}} number of ways. It explores the new internet media using <b>action</b> <b>research.</b> At the same time it uses the new media {{to reach out to the}} participants in <b>action</b> <b>research</b> studies. Three new varieties of <b>action</b> <b>research</b> are developed and described. Ethnographic <b>action</b> <b>research,</b> as its name implies, takes an ethnographic approach to <b>action</b> <b>research</b> studies. Network <b>action</b> <b>research</b> researches community networks – the “communicative ecology” – while employing those networks as <b>research</b> tools.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a didactical {{experience in the}} Masters course of the Department of Urbanism of the Delft University of Technology (The Netherlands) and {{issues related to the}} academicization of its curriculum. Although urbanism is a firmly established discipline in many curricula, in The Netherlands it has entered higher education as a practical and vocational discipline from the engineering tradition. The experience of the implementation of a stronger academic approach in such an environment reveals differences in worldviews among practitioners and academics, which result in frictions about the role and the form of academic research in Masters’ education. This is becoming more evident as urbanism is confronted with the need to situate <b>research</b> <b>actions</b> and outcomes in relation to other more established disciplines, for example through research assessments. We have found problems related to a dysfunctional relationship between research claims and <b>research</b> <b>actions,</b> problems with assessment, trans-disciplinary dialogue and other issues common to areas of knowledge and practice recently entering academia. Here we discuss how new courses and requirements were introduced, that aimed to encourage an academic attitude and improve outputs in relation to academic standards, and how this was done by seeking a dialogue between research and design practice. The experience is examined both {{from the point of view}} of staff’s expectations and students’ reception. UrbanismArchitectur...|$|E
