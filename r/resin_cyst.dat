Previous studies have shown that the resistance can be attributed to <b>resin</b> <b>cyst</b> number/size, essential oil and/or crude fat contents in the bark [14, 15], and essential oil and/or crude resin (determined from diethyl ether extracts) contents in the bark [11, 16]. The degree of resistance to voles among the larches significantly correlated with the contents of the diethyl ether extracts of the bark [17]. Some diterpenoids in the petroleum ether extract from the branch bark of L. gmelinii var. japonica could be associated with the resistance to the vole [18]. Our previous report [19] also showed that the chemical composition of the branch bark tissue of L. gmelinii var. japonica was an effective index for discrimination of hybrid larch F 1 (L. gmelinii var. japonica × L. kaempferi) seedlings with superior growth rate and chemical defense, e.g., resistance to voles.|$|E
