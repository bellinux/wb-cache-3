40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of {{principal component analysis}} suffers badly {{in the presence of}} outliers. This paper proposes two novel approaches for robust principal component analysis based on semidefinite programming. The first method, maximum mean absolute deviation <b>rounding,</b> seeks <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> large spread in the data while damping the effect of outliers. The second method produces a low-leverage decomposition of the data that attempts to form a low-rank model for the data by separating out corrupted observations. This paper also presents efficient computational methods for solving these semidefinite programs. Numerical experiments confirm the value of these new techniques...|$|R
40|$|The dipole {{patterns}} in the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric structures are drawn according to experimentally determined symmetry changes in the ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics. For the ferroelectrics the dipoles of the unit cells for one domain are oriented in parallel and the <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> the polarisation in the adjacent domains are at definite angles to each other. It is assumed for the antiferroelectrics, that the superstructural unit cell is formed by the adjacent cells of the paraelectrical modification; the subcells having the antiparallel <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> the polarisation. It is these superstructural cells of the antiferroelectrics that are determined during the experimental investigations of the antiferroelectrics. The superstructural cells of the adjacent domains are different. In one case, {{the difference is that}} in the adjacent domains, the <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> the polarisation in the subcells form an angle (e. g., in PbZrO 3). In other cases the superstructural cells have not only different <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> the polarisation in the subcells but different signs of the enantiomorphism (e. g., NH 4 H 2 PO 4). In the third case, {{the only difference is that}} the superstructural unit cells in the adjacent domains are turned by an angle to each other <b>round</b> the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the subcell polarisation [e. g., (NH 4) 2 H 3 IO 6], etc...|$|R
