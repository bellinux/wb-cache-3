40|$|Objectives: We {{aimed to}} assess the {{effectiveness}} and feasibility of head-and-neck Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) with low tube voltage <b>and</b> low concentration <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> combined with iterative reconstruction algorithm. Methods: 92 patients were randomly divided into group A and B: patients in group A received a conventional scan with 120 kVp <b>and</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> of 320 mgI/ml. Patients in group B, 80 kVp <b>and</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> of 270 mgI/ml were used along with iterative reconstruction algorithm techniques. Image quality, radiation dose and the effectively consumed iodine amount between two groups were analyzed and compared. Results: Image quality of CTA of head-and-neck vessels obtained from patients in group B was significantly improved quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, CT attenuation values in group B were also significantly higher than that in group A (p, 0. 001). Furthermore, compared with the protocol whereby 120 kVp and 320 mgI/dl were administrated, the mean radiation dose and consumed iodine amount in protocol B were also reduced by 50 % and 15. 6 %, respectively (p, 0. 001).

40|$|RATIONALE and OBJECTIVE: As both <b>contrast</b> <b>and</b> {{radiation}} dose affect {{the quality of}} CT images, a constant image quality in abdominal contrast-enhanced multi-detector CT (CE-MDCT) could be obtained balancing radiation <b>and</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> dose according to the age of the patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two (38 M; 34 F; aged 20 - 83 years) patients underwent a single-pass abdominal CE-MDCT. Patients were divided into three different age-groups: A(20 - 44 years); B (45 - 65 years); C (> 65 years). For each group, a different Noise Index (NI) <b>and</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> dose (370 mgI/mL) was selected as follows: A (NI= 15; 2. 5 mL/kg); B (NI = 12. 5; 2 mL/kg); C (NI= 10; 1. 5 mL/kg). Radiation exposure was reported as Dose Length Product (DLP) in mGy*cm. For quantitative analysis, Signal-to-Noise (SNR) and Contrast-to-Noise (CNR) ratios were calculated for both the liver (L) and the abdominal aorta (A). Statistical analysis was performed with a one-way ANOVA. Standard imaging criteria were used for qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Whereas peak hepatic enhancement was 152 ± 16, 128 ± 12 and 101 ± 14 HU (p < 0. 001) for Group A, B and C, respectively, no significant differences were observed in the corresponding SNRL with 9. 2 ± 1. 4, 9. 1 ± 1. 2 and 9. 2 ± 3. Radiation (mGy*cm) <b>and</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> dose (mL) administered were 476 ± 147 and 155 ± 27 for Group A, 926 ± 291 and 130 ± 16 for Group B and 1981 ± 451 and 106 ± 15 for Group C, respectively (p < 0. 001). None of the studies was graded as poor or inadequate by both readers and the PABAK ranged between 0. 48 and 0. 93 for all but one criteria.

40|$|A physiologically-based kidney {{model was}} {{developed}} to analyze the renal excretion and kidney exposure of hydrophilic agents, in particular <b>contrast</b> <b>media,</b> in rats.

The model was established using experimental data on the physiological steady state without administration of any <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> or drugs. These data included the sodium and urea concentration gradient along the cortico-medullary axis, water reabsorption, urine flow and sodium as well as urea urine concentrations for a normal hydration state. The model was evaluated by predicting the effects of mannitol <b>and</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> administration <b>and</b> comparing to experimental data on cortico-medullary concentration gradients, urine flow, urine viscosity, hydrostatic tubular pressures and single nephron glomerular filtration rate. Finally the model was used to analyze and compare typical examples of ionic and non-ionic monomeric as well as non-ionic dimeric <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> {{with respect to their}} osmolality and viscosity. With the computational kidney model, urine flow depended mainly on osmolality, while osmolality and viscosity were important determinants for tubular hydrostatic pressure and kidney exposure. The low diuretic effect of dimeric <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> in combination with their high intrinsic viscosity resulted in a high viscosity within the tubular fluid. In comparison to monomeric <b>contrast</b> <b>media,</b> this led to a higher increase in tubular pressure, to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate and tubular flow and to an increase in kidney exposure.
