25|$|In the {{two years}} {{immediately}} following World War II, the UPWA threatened repeatedly to have its federal workers strike. A fearful Congress passed legislation in 1946 depriving federal workers of their salaries if they belonged to any union which advocated the right of federal workers to strike, and which required them to sign affidavits {{that they did not}} belong to any union which did. In 1947, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which made it illegal for federal employees to strike and penalized them with immediate dismissal. A third federal law, passed in 1955, made it illegal for federal workers to strike, advocate the right to strike, or belong to any organization which advocated the <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to strike.|$|E

25|$|Workers {{in federal}} {{agencies}} had formed craft-based unions {{on the local}} level beginning in the early 1880s. The growing power of these and other unions in the federal government led President Theodore Roosevelt to issue two Executive Orders (in 1902 and 1906) essentially banning unions in the federal civil service. Under Congressional pressure, President William H. Taft made the Executive Orders less onerous in 1912. Unhappy with Taft's refusal to rescind the orders entirely, Congress passed the Lloyd-La Follette Act (§6, 37 Stat. 555, 5 U.S.C. § 7511) on August 24, 1912, declaring establishing the right of federal employees to join unions (albeit not the <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to bargain collectively). Five years later, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) acted to bring the various local unions together to form a single national union, the National Federation of Federal Employees, in September 1917.|$|E

They are both {{surprised}} by Roy's beautiful home and the elegant wedding details, and Roy tells them he runs a very successful gravel company. During his wedding toast, Roy stuns his lovely bride by performing [...] "She's Got a Way" [...] by Billy Joel on the piano, saying that {{he told her he}} was taking boxing lessons as a cover for learning some music for her instead. Pam and Jim, convinced they already know everything about one another but stunned by Roy's transformation, try to find things about themselves the other does not know. This is exacerbated by Jim's frequent calls about a new business he is starting with a friend, because Jim and Pam agreed that the venture was not <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> but Jim then signed onto it without telling his wife he had done so. Pam tries unsuccessfully to bait Jim {{to find out what the}} secret is and becomes increasingly annoyed that her husband is lying to her.|$|E
