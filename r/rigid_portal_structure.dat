40|$|The {{structure}} and assembly of bacteriophage T 4 {{has been extensively}} studied. However, the detailed <b>structure</b> of the <b>portal</b> protein remained unknown. Here we report {{the structure of the}} bacteriophage T 4 portal assembly, gene product 20 (gp 20), determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to 3. 6 Å resolution. In addition, analysis of a 10 Å resolution cryo-EM map of an empty prolate T 4 head shows how the dodecameric portal assembly interacts with the capsid protein gp 23 at the special pentameric vertex. The gp 20 structure also verifies that the portal assembly is required for initiating head assembly, for attachment of the packaging motor, and for participation in DNA packaging. Comparison of the Myoviridae T 4 <b>portal</b> <b>structure</b> with the known <b>portal</b> <b>structures</b> of f 29, SPP 1 and P 22, representing Podo- and Siphoviridae, shows that the <b>portal</b> <b>structure</b> probably dates back to a time when self-replicating microorganisms were being established on Earth...|$|R

The processing of noisy microscopical images requires advanced data processing methodologies in which one must carefully avoid the introduction of any form of bias into the data set. Using a novel multivariate statistical approach {{to the analysis of}} symmetry, we studied the structure of the bacteriophage SPP 1 portal protein oligomer.

40|$|Anatomic {{distortion}} and {{displacement of}} hilar structures due to liver lobe atrophy and hypertrophy occasionally complicates the surgical approach for biliary stricture repair. Benign biliary stricture following hepatic resection deserves special consideration {{in this regard}} because the inevitable hypertrophy of the residual liver causes marked rotation and displacement of the hepatic hilum that if not anticipated may render exposure for repair difficult and dangerous. Three patients with biliary stricture after hepatectomy illustrate the influence of hepatic regeneration on attempts at subsequent stricture repair. Following left hepatectomy, hypertrophy of the right and caudate lobes causes an anteromedial rotation and displacement of the <b>portal</b> <b>structures.</b> After right hepatectomy, the rotation is posterolateral, and a thoracoabdominal approach may be necessary for adequate exposure.
