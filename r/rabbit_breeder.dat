50|$|A Dutch <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeder,</b> Adriann de Cock, is {{generally}} credited with developing the dwarf Lop Breeds by crossing together {{the largest of}} the Lop Breeds, French Lop, with the Netherland Dwarf during the winter of year 1949-1950. Years of hard work paid off to produce the smallest of the Lop Breed, and Holland Lops of around 2 kg - 2.5 kg were first shown in 1964.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to find out the work time spent by female <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeders</b> and factors influencing the work time spent to raise rabbits in Soppeng, South Sulawesi. The research used survey method with female <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeders</b> as analysis unit. Population of 356 female <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeders</b> in Soppeng was used and a sample of 78 female <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeders</b> were selected by region. The result of the research showed that average work time of female <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeders</b> was 3. 044 hours per day, which was spent cleaning cages and equipment, preparing feedstuffs and feeding on rabbits, assisting bunnies breastfeed to their mother and health care. The F-test results reveal that the most significantly influential factors affecting female <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeders</b> work time was household income, number of dependents, rabbit breeding income, and the level of experience in breeding rabbit...|$|R

50|$|In 1726 Manningham {{published}} Exact Diary of {{what was}} observed during a close attendance upon Mary Toft the pretended <b>Rabbit</b> <b>Breeder.</b> Mary Toft of Godalming declared that she {{had given birth to}} several rabbits, and fragments of these were produced. Manningham, working with James Douglas, showed that these were pieces of adult and not of young rabbits, and that Toft was not parturient. They absolved the credulous Nathaniel St André of complicity. In the aftermath, William Hogarth drew Toft, London gossiped of the affair, and Manningham's name became more widely known.|$|E
50|$|The Miniature Lion Lop rabbit is a {{recognised}} breed by the BRC. It has lopped {{ears and}} the mane of the Lionhead and should weigh between 1.5-1.6 kg (3.4-3.8 lbs).The Miniature Lion Lop {{was developed in}} England in the early 2000s and accepted by the BRC in 2006.The breed was pioneered by <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeder</b> Jane Bramley, who contributed {{a lot of work}} into getting the breed recognised.

50|$|The Blanc de Hotot was {{developed}} in Hotot-en-Auge, Normandy, France by Eugenie Bernhard, a noted <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeder.</b> She bred for the desired white and black coloration on a rabbit suitable for both meat and fur production. Around 1902, Bernhard crossed Checkered Giant, White Vienna and White Flemish Giant rabbits, and by 1912 produced what is recognized as the first Blanc de Hotot rabbit. In 1920, {{a member of the}} breed appeared in show {{for the first time at}} the Exposition International d'Aviculture in Paris, France, and they were officially recognized as a breed in 1922. In 1921 and 1922, they were first exported to the United States, although the breed was not popular in that country and died out.|$|E

40|$|Rabbits {{obtained}} from a South African <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeder</b> exhibited deformities of the distal forelimbs. The clinical, radiological and histological presentation of mid-antebrachial valgus formation (a. k. a distal foreleg curvature) in these rabbits was consistent with an autosomal recessive trait associated with a chondrodystrophic lesion of the distal ulna epiphysis 1 st described in the 1960 s. The impact this might have on South African farming enterprises and laboratory facilities has not been established, but the heritability and welfare implications of this condition make it a concern. Mildly affected animals can adapt to the deformity with some housing adjustments, but severely affected animals may require humane euthanasia. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|In Spore 46 {{we wrote}} at length {{on the subject}} of {{livestock}} for the landless. The article began with the opening remark 'Population growth, fragmentation of land holdings, poverty and increasing urbanization are resulting in ever larger numbers of individuals in many ACP countries trying to produce food without access either to any or to adequate land. ' Two Ghanaian authors seeing this need have written books on two of the livestock species referred to in the article. In Try the rabbit Stephen Adjare refers to himself as a layman who has kept rabbits since 1957 and the book is based on his experience of rabbit farming and is written {{for those who want to}} begin rabbit rearing. 'One of the main advantages of small-scale rabbit farming,' he says, 'is that it requires minimal capital investment. Young people can easily afford to start keeping rabbits with virtually no financial risk. The venture could begin as a backyard or garden enterprise, requiring very little space. ' In this well-illustrated (both photographically and diagrammatically) small book, Mr Adjare takes the would-be <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeder</b> in easily assimilated stages through all the steps involved in breeding and raising rabbits; from constructing rabbit hutches, through breeds and breeding, health and nutrition to diseases and pests. The author of Snail farming in West Africa, Mr Joseph Cobbinah, makes the point that demand for snail meat has become so great that the wild species are in serious danger of becoming extinct as a result of this demand as well as through the loss of tropical rainforest and unsound farming practices which further endanger it. Snail farming is a way of meeting this increase in demand. Mr Cobbinah points out that the growing interest in snail farming has created a pressing need for more information on the biology, genetics, nutritional requirements, aestivation and general husbandry of snails, which he seeks to address in this practical guide. But he also points out that snails (unlike the prolific rabbit) are slow-growing animals and as such do not represent a way of making money quickly but should be viewed as part of an integrated system of farm management.

5000|$|Exports to the United States {{began again}} in 1978, and in September of that year, the first Blanc de Hotots {{to be shown}} in the US were {{exhibited}} at the New Mexico State Fair. In 1979, the Blanc de Hotot was recognized by the American <b>Rabbit</b> <b>Breeders</b> Association. In the US, Blanc de Hotots have been crossed with White Beverens, White New Zealands and White Satins to increase the available gene pool. In 2004, additional imports to the US were made from Germany, the Netherlands and England. The Blanc de Hotot is considered globally endangered, and is listed by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy at [...] "threatened" [...] status, meaning they have a global population of less than 1,000 and less than 100 registrations in the US each year. The Blanc de Hotot is recognized by the British Rabbit Council and the American <b>Rabbit</b> <b>Breeders</b> Association.

50|$|Gotland <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeders</b> {{strive to}} produce animals that can consist on natural types of feed, mainly a good quality hay, {{which may be}} {{replaced}} with fresh grass and other non-toxic plants during summertime.
