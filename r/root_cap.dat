25|$|Early root {{growth is}} one of the {{functions}} of the apical meristem located near the tip of the root. The meristem cells more or less continuously divide, producing more meristem, <b>root</b> <b>cap</b> cells (these are sacrificed to protect the meristem), and undifferentiated root cells. The latter become the primary tissues of the root, first undergoing elongation, a process that pushes the root tip forward in the growing medium. Gradually these cells differentiate and mature into specialized cells of the root tissues.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} form an ectomycorrhizal connection, the fungal hyphae, {{originating}} from a soil propagule or an established mycorrhiza, must first grow towards the plant’s roots. Afterwards, it must envelope and penetrate the <b>root</b> <b>cap</b> cells and infect them, thus allowing the symbiotic Hartig net and associated structures to form. Both the plant and fungal partners must engage in a precise developmental sequence that allows the necessary genes in each symbiont to be expressed in order to carry out these actions.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{connection}} of fungal hyphae and <b>root</b> <b>cap</b> cells, growth must continue inwards to the epidermal cells wherein the hyphae multiply to form layers that will eventually yield a mature mantle. In some associations, such as Eucalyptus globulus–Pisolithus tinctorius, up to 65 genes can {{be responsible for the}} production of the fungal mantle. Upregulation of genes responsible for translation and cell growth, such as eIF4A, and those responsible for membrane synthesis and function, such as the multigene SRAP32 family and hydrophobins, are quite common in EcM mycobionts. Hilbert and Martin discovered 10 out of 520 polypeptides recorded during their study were unique to the symbiotic condition and subsequently these symbiosis-related (SR) proteins were termed “ectomycorrhizins”.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A gravity-insensitive mutant was {{isolated}} from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Zhonghua 11) transformed by Agro-bacterium tumefaciens. The mutant’s shoot growth (prostrate growth) was insensitive to gravity; whereas root growth dis-played a normal positive gravitropism.

500|$|The {{original}} {{family name}} of brassicas was Cruciferae, which {{derived from the}} flower petal pattern thought by medieval Europeans to resemble a crucifix. The word brassica derives from bresic, a Celtic word for cabbage. Many European and Asiatic names for cabbage are derived from the Celto-Slavic <b>root</b> <b>cap</b> or kap, meaning [...] "head". The late Middle English word cabbage derives from the word caboche ("head"), from the Picard dialect of Old French. This in turn is {{a variant of the}} Old French caboce. Through the centuries, [...] "cabbage" [...] and its derivatives have been used as slang for numerous items, occupations and activities. Cash and tobacco have both been described by the slang [...] "cabbage", while [...] "cabbage-head" [...] means a fool or stupid person and [...] "cabbaged" [...] means to be exhausted or, vulgarly, in a vegetative state.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>root</b> <b>cap</b> is to enable {{downward}} growth of the root, with the <b>root</b> <b>cap</b> covering the sensitive tissue in the root. Also, the <b>root</b> <b>cap</b> enables geoperception or gravitropism. This allows the plant to grow downwards (with gravity) or upwards (against gravity).|$|E
50|$|The <b>root</b> <b>cap</b> is {{a section}} of tissue {{at the tip of}} a plant root. It is also called calyptra. Root caps contain statocytes which are {{involved}} in gravity perception in plants. If the cap is carefully removed the root will grow randomly. The <b>root</b> <b>cap</b> protects the growing tip in plants. It secretes mucilage to ease the movement of the root through soil, and may also be involved in communication with the soil microbiota.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if patterns of cell differentiation are similar in primary and lateral roots, I performed a morphometric analysis of the ultrastructure of calyptrogen, columella, and peripheral cells in primary and lateral roots of Helianthus annuus. Each cell type {{is characterized by a}} unique ultrastructure, and the ultrastructural changes characteristic of cellular differentiation in <b>root</b> <b>caps</b> are organelle specific. No major structural differences exist in the structures of the composite cell types, or in patterns of cell differentiation in caps of primary vs. lateral roots...|$|R
40|$|Some plants release {{thousands}} of viable cells from <b>root</b> <b>caps</b> into the soil. These cells can be technically defined as Root Border Cells (BRD cells) and {{may play a}} role in the regulation of microbial populations in the rhizosphere. Chemoattractants released from pea (Pisam sativum) to Agrobacterium tumefaciens were characterized by using lectin and chemical analysis for heat-stability, size, and solubility. To understand the process of BRD cell release, a relationship was established between pectolytic enzyme activity and the release of pea BRD cells...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{the main}} {{products}} exuded by roots include high molecular compounds like exopolysaccharides and proteins that comprise root mucilage, {{low molecular weight}} compounds, and border cells [3]. We observed strong influence of exogenous HA in shape and number of border cells detached from maize <b>root</b> <b>caps</b> and their effects on beneficial bacteria survival and activity [19]. Border cells are released from root tips by a controlled process and are viable and metabolically active cells [3]. In view of this, it is plausible to attribute a putative effect of HS in plant metabolic profile and consequently in the chemical behavior of the rhizosphere. The first step to achieve is to know the exudation profile of plants treated with humic acids.|$|R

40|$|Expression of an {{inducible}} gene with sequences common to genes encoding pectin methylesterase (PME) {{was found to}} be tightly correlated, both spatially and temporally, with border cell separation in pea <b>root</b> <b>caps.</b> Partial inhibition of the gene's expression by antisense mRNA in transgenic pea hairy roots prevented the normal separation of root border cells from the root tip into the external environment. This phenotype was correlated with an increase in extracellular pH, reduced root elongation, and altered cellular morphology. The translation product of the gene exhibited PME activity in vitro. These results are consistent with the long-standing hypothesis that the demethylation of pectin by PME {{plays a key role in}} cell wall metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Root {{gravitropism}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} factors to determine root architecture. To understand the mechanism underlying root gravitropism, we isolated a rice (Xiushui 63) mutant defective in root gravitropism, designated as gls 1. Vertical sections of <b>root</b> <b>caps</b> revealed that gls 1 mutant displayed normal distribution of amyloplast in the columella cells compared with the wild type. The gls 1 mutant was less sensitive to 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) than the wild type. Genetic analysis indicated that the phenotype of gls 1 mutant was caused by a single recessive mutation, which is mapped in a 255 -kb region between RM 16253 and CAPS 1 on the short arm of chromosome 4...|$|R

However, ultrastructural and cytochemical studies of the membranous ligules of several taxa, particularly Lolium species, have challenged that rather simplistic view and suggest that these ligules play {{a more active role in}} the life of the grass plant as a secretory tissue.

Using this system, we grew transgenic soybean with a GmPT 7 promoter–b-glucuronidase fusion gene and evaluated GmPT 7 expression in detail. GmPT 7 was highly expressed in mature, but not in collapsed, arbus-cule-containing cortical cells, suggesting its importance in the absorption of fungus-derived phosphate and/or arbus-cule development.

40|$|Roots of {{many species}} grow {{downward}} (orthogravitropism) only when illuminated. Previous work {{suggests that this}} is a calcium-regulated response and that both calmodulin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases participate in transducing gravity and light stimuli. A genomic sequence has been obtained for a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase homolog (MCK 1) expressed in <b>root</b> <b>caps,</b> the site of perception for both light and gravity. This homolog consists of 7265 base pairs and contains 11 exons and 10 introns. Since MCK 1 is expressed constitutively in both light and dark, {{it is unlikely that the}} light directly affects MCK 1 expression, though the activity of the protein may be affected by light. In cultivars showing light-regulated gravitropism, we hypothesize that MCK 1, or a homolog, functions in establishing the auxin asymmetry necessary for orthogravitropism...|$|R

50|$|In the <b>root</b> <b>cap</b> (a tissue {{at the tip}} of the root) {{there is}} a special subset of cells, called statocytes. Inside the statocyte cells, some {{specialized}} amyloplasts are involved in the perception of gravity by the plant (gravitropism). These specialized amyloplasts—called statoliths—are denser than the cytoplasm and can sediment according to the gravity vector. The statoliths are enmeshed in a web of actin and it is thought that their sedimentation transmits the gravitropic signal by activating mechanosensitive channels. The gravitropic signal then leads to the reorientation of auxin efflux carriers and subsequent redistribution of auxin streams in the <b>root</b> <b>cap</b> and root as a whole. The changed relations in concentration of auxin leads to differential growth of the root tissues. Taken together, the root is then turning to follow the gravity stimuli. Statoliths are also found in the endodermic layer of the inflorescence stem. The redistribution of auxin causes the shoot to turn in a direction opposite that of the gravity stimuli.|$|E

40|$|Primary {{roots of}} a starchless mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana L. are {{strongly}} graviresponsive despite lacking amyloplasts in their columella cells. The ultrastructures of calyptrogen and peripheral cells in wild-type {{as compared to}} mutant seedlings are not significantly different.

30|$|Drought {{is one of}} {{the most}} common abiotic stresses, which {{significantly}} affects crop production (Fedoroff et al. 2010). Drought stress induces a series of physiological and biochemical changes in plants, strongly interferes cellular homeostasis and causes morphological changes, e.g. repression of cell growth and photosynthesis, and activation of respiration. Moreover, when two experimental groups are respectively exposed to water sufficiency and water deficiency conditions during grain filling, the results of stored carbon remobilization in wheat are apparently different: one group is senescence and the other accelerates grain filling (Yang et al. 2000, 2001). However, telluric plants have developed specific mechanisms to response and tolerance to short- and long-term adverse environments, particularly to drought (Harb et al. 2010). For example, plants can accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteins to enhance drought tolerance (Zhu 2002). In addition, when encountered drought stress, plant <b>root</b> <b>caps</b> synthesize abscisic acid (ABA) to trigger a signaling cascade in guard cells, and then leads to stomatal closure and reduction of water loss (MacRobbie 1998).|$|R
