500|$|Evans paid {{particular}} attention to detail in the printing of her Mother Goose. The [...] "antique look" [...] added to the Regency style artwork, while his ink and colouring choices conveyed {{the look of a}} hand-coloured book suitable for a mass-market edition. To achieve the antique look, <b>rough</b> <b>paper</b> was pressed and printed, with the roughness restored after printing by dipping the paper in water. As an example of 19th-century book production, Mother Goose is considered exceptional, and facsimiles were printed well into the mid-20th century.|$|E
60|$|It was a small, olive-green book, delicately bound, {{and printed}} upon <b>rough</b> <b>paper.</b> It {{had been given}} to my mother, evidently, for her Christian name was inside, written in a fine, dashing hand, and {{underneath}} were some initials which had become indistinct. Then, having satisfied myself of this, and handled it for a few moments, I turned over the pages rapidly and began to read.|$|E
6000|$|... "Steady on!" [...] I said. [...] "These candles are wanted," [...] {{speaking}} with a half-hysterical facetiousness, and scratching {{away at a}} match the while for the mantel candlesticks. My hands trembled so much that twice I missed the <b>rough</b> <b>paper</b> of the matchbox. As the mantel emerged from darkness again, two candles in the remoter end of the window were eclipsed. But with the same match I also relit the larger mirror candles, and those on the floor near the doorway, so that for the moment I seemed to gain on the extinctions. But then in a volley there vanished four lights at once in different corners of the room, and I struck another match in quivering haste, and stood hesitating whither to take it.|$|E
6000|$|... "This yer's my home, Jack," [...] said Brown with a sigh, as {{he threw}} himself upon the bed and motioned his {{companion}} to a chair. [...] "Her room's t' {{other end of the}} hall. It's more'n six months since we've lived together, or met, except at meals. It's mighty <b>rough</b> <b>papers</b> on the head of the house, ain't it?" [...] he said with a forced laugh. [...] "But I'm glad to see you, Jack, d--d glad," [...] and he reached from the bed, and again shook the unresponsive hand of Jack Hamlin.|$|R
6000|$|A silence {{followed}} these positive statements. The Old Man glanced quickly {{around the}} group. Then his face slowly changed. [...] "That's so," [...] he said reflectively, after a pause, [...] "certingly {{a sort of}} a skunk and suthin of a fool. In course." [...] He {{was silent for a moment}} as in painful contemplation of the unsavoriness and folly of the unpopular Smiley. [...] "Dismal weather, ain't it?" [...] he added, now fully embarked on the current of prevailing sentiment. [...] "Mighty <b>rough</b> <b>papers</b> on the boys, and no show for money this season. And tomorrow's Christmas." ...|$|R
60|$|Grandma {{turned over}} the little packet tied up with a faded pink ribbon; a dozen yellow notes written on <b>rough,</b> thick <b>paper,</b> with red wafers still {{adhering}} to the folds, showing plainly that they were written before the day of initial note-paper and self-sealing envelopes.|$|R
60|$|Sulaco, {{pastoral}} and sleepy, {{with its}} opulent Campo {{and the rich}} silver mine, heard the din of arms fitfully in its fortunate isolation. It was nevertheless in the very forefront of the defence with men and money; but the very rumours reached it circuitously--from abroad even, so much was it {{cut off from the}} rest of the Republic, not only by natural obstacles, but also by the vicissitudes of the war. The Monteristos were besieging Cayta, an important postal link. The overland couriers ceased to come across the mountains, and no muleteer would consent to risk the journey at last; even Bonifacio on one occasion failed to return from Sta. Marta, either not daring to start, or perhaps captured by the parties of the enemy raiding the country between the Cordillera and the capital. Monterist publications, however, found their way into the province, mysteriously enough; and also Monterist emissaries preaching death to aristocrats in the villages and towns of the Campo. Very early, at the beginning of the trouble, Hernandez, the bandit, had proposed (through the agency of an old priest of a village in the wilds) to deliver two of them to the Ribierist authorities in Tonoro. They had come to offer him a free pardon and the rank of colonel from General Montero in consideration of joining the rebel army with his mounted band. No notice was taken at the time of the proposal. It was joined, as an evidence of good faith, to a petition praying the Sulaco Assembly for permission to enlist, with all his followers, in the forces being then raised in Sulaco for the defence of the Five-Year Mandate of regeneration. The petition, like everything else, had found its way into Don Jose's hands. He had showed to Mrs. Gould these pages of dirty-greyish <b>rough</b> <b>paper</b> (perhaps looted in some village store), covered with the crabbed, illiterate handwriting of the old padre, carried off from his hut by the side of a mud-walled church to be the secretary of the dreaded Salteador. They had both bent in the lamplight of the Gould drawing-room over the document containing the fierce and yet humble appeal of the man against the blind and stupid barbarity turning an honest ranchero into a bandit. A postscript of the priest stated that, but for being deprived of his liberty for ten days, he had been treated with humanity and the respect due to his sacred calling. He had been, it appears, confessing and absolving the chief and most of the band, and he guaranteed the sincerity of their good disposition. He had distributed heavy penances, no doubt in the way of litanies and fasts; but he argued shrewdly that it would be difficult for them to make their peace with God durably till they had made peace with men.|$|E
5000|$|During the Aztec times, Aztecs used {{mulberry}} and {{fig tree}} bark {{to make a}} <b>rough</b> <b>paper</b> called [...] "Amatl". When tissue paper became available, artisans usually layer 40 to 50 layers of tissue and punch designs into them using [...] "fierritos", a type of chisel.|$|E
50|$|They are {{frequently}} used on <b>rough</b> <b>paper</b> that holds pigment grains well. They {{can also be}} used on prepared primed canvases for underdrawing for a painting.

50|$|Founded {{four years}} before the American {{magazine}} Weird Tales was initiated in March 1923, Der Orchideengarten {{is considered to be}} the first fantasy magazine. Also described as largely 'supernatural horror', it was edited by World War I correspondent and freelance writer Karl Hans Strobl and Alfons von Czibulka, published by Dreiländerverlag. It had 24 pages per issue printed on <b>rough</b> book <b>paper.</b>|$|R

50|$|A slick {{magazine}} is a magazine printed on high-quality glossy paper. The term {{may have come}} into use in the 1930s, and was used to distinguish these magazines from pulp magazines, which were printed on cheap, <b>rough</b> <b>paper.</b> The slicks also attempted {{to appeal to a}} more elite audience. Examples of magazines regarded as slicks include Vanity Fair, Saturday Evening Post, Better Homes and Gardens, and Harper's.|$|E
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{consists of}} a small oblong quarto measuring some 15 by 19 centimetres. It is in excellent condition and retains its original binding formed from several sheets of <b>rough</b> <b>paper</b> folded, pasted and stitched to a strip of vellum to form the spine. The manuscript contains 32 leaves bearing two pairs of hand-ruled six-line staves on which are twelve short pieces written in a neat hand.|$|E
5000|$|Until the 1970s, {{commercial}} poster hangers always [...] "cooked" [...] {{their own}} paste, {{but since then}} many have bought pre-cooked instant pastes.

Cheap, <b>rough</b> <b>paper</b> such as newsprint, works well, as it can be briefly dipped in the mixture to saturate the fibres.|$|E
30|$|Untreated {{cardboard}} industry effluent {{was collected}} from the cardboard industry, Yamunanagar (Haryana), India, and stored at 4 °C until used for analysis.

After this pretreatment step, cardboard industry waste water was used as quantification and production medium for PHA production by selected bacterial isolate.|$|R
5000|$|Gill found {{differences}} in the style and care of folding between hotels. One example from Tokyo, [...] "with its tiny pleats, really stands out", according to the photographer. [...] "Only in Japan did I find such minute attention to detail. ... The New York City example, on the other hand, is very poor quality, asymmetrical on <b>rough,</b> thin <b>paper.</b> And the Romania example is a great slab with a small, right-hand fold." ...|$|R
25|$|Although pulp {{magazines}} {{were primarily}} an American phenomenon, {{there were also}} a number of British pulp magazines published between the Edwardian era and World War II. Notable UK pulps included Pall Mall Magazine, The Novel Magazine, Cassell's Magazine, The Story-Teller, The Sovereign Magazine, Hutchinson's Adventure-Story and Hutchinson's Mystery-Story. The German fantasy magazine Der Orchideengarten had a similar format to American pulp magazines, {{in that it was}} printed on <b>rough</b> pulp <b>paper</b> and heavily illustrated.|$|R

50|$|His {{works are}} not all {{inherently}} abstract, either, in his delightful, natively drawn Cakes (painted on <b>rough</b> <b>paper</b> bags), and The French Wigs (painted on canvas), Komarin places the image front and center, akin to Joe Bradley’s “Superman.” The simplistic, yet beguiling Cakes sometimes lean like the Tower of Pisa, while dripped frosting showcases Komarin’s playful manner and charm. According to the artist, the Cakes are a marriage between the domestic and the architectural. He credits his mother’s cake baking, {{as well as his}} father’s career as an architect, as the genesis for this image.|$|E
50|$|She {{was born}} August 7, 1959 in Nagasaki, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. Her father left the family {{when she and}} her younger sister were in primary school. Her mother was a dance teacher and bar hostess, who soon began living with another dance instructor, and later remarried. Shungiku was often forced to sleep with her stepfather, and her mother would allow it. One of Shungiku's happiest {{memories}} from her childhood was getting a ream of <b>rough</b> <b>paper</b> from her fourth grade teacher, as a gift for saying that her dream was to become a manga artist.|$|E

5000|$|Gutenberg's most {{important}} {{innovation in the}} mid 15th century development of his press was not the printing itself, but the casting of Latinate types. Unlike Chinese characters, {{which are based on}} a uniform square area, European Latin characters vary in width, from the very wide [...] "M" [...] to the slender [...] "l". Gutenberg developed an adjustable mold which could accommodate an infinite variety of widths. From then until at least 400 years later, type started with cutting punches, which would be struck into a brass [...] "matrix". The matrix was inserted {{into the bottom of the}} adjustable mold and the negative space formed by the mold cavity plus the matrix acted as the master for each letter that was cast. The casting material was an alloy usually containing lead, which had a low melting point, cooled readily, and could be easily filed and finished. In those early days, type design had to not only imitate the familiar handwritten forms common to readers, but also account for the limitations of the printing process, such as the <b>rough</b> <b>papers</b> of uneven thicknesses, the squeezing or splashing properties of the ink, and the eventual wear on the type itself.|$|R
60|$|In {{the later}} {{afternoon}} Lewisham, having unpacked his books {{to a certain}} extent, and so forth, was visible to all men, visibly in the highest spirits, carrying home Ethel's shopping. There were parcels and cones in blue and parcels in <b>rough</b> grey <b>paper</b> {{and a bag of}} confectionery, and {{out of one of the}} side pockets of that East-end overcoat the tail of a haddock protruded from its paper. Under such magnificent sanctions and amid such ignoble circumstances did this honeymoon begin.|$|R
5000|$|Most mass-produced {{prints and}} {{paintings}} originate in Asia. These are essentially posters, {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "Hong Kong horrors," [...] printed on <b>rough</b> <b>paper,</b> making the absence of brush strokes less apparent. There is a confusion between [...] "mass-produced paintings" [...] which are actually prints. These are being sold over the internet described as real oil paintings, taking advantage of the difficulty of spotting the scam behind the screen. Sometimes a few brush strokes are added to the prints to give them a more authentic oil-painting look.|$|E
50|$|A mockup of a layout {{might be}} created to get early feedback, usually {{before all the}} content is {{actually}} ready. Whether for paper or electronic media, {{the first draft of}} a layout might be simply a <b>rough</b> <b>paper</b> and pencil sketch. A comprehensive layout for a new magazine might show placeholders for text and images, but demonstrate placement, typographic style, and other idioms intended to set the pattern for actual issues, or a particular unfinished issue. A website wireframe is a low-cost way to show layout without doing all the work of creating the final HTML and CSS, and without writing the copy or creating any images.|$|E
50|$|However, Davison made {{experiments}} with different techniques and processes, {{and turned away}} from the naturalistic photography soon. He started to use a pinhole camera for creation of pictorialistic photographs {{as one of the first}} photographers. He made a picture called The Onion Field (originally named An Old Farmstead) in 1890, without sharp outlines on a <b>rough</b> <b>paper,</b> having an effect of painting. It is considered as the first impressionistic photography. Nevertheless, Davisons' photographs became an object of polemics and controversy in the Royal Photographic Society. He decided to leave the society and to establish a new organisation, the Linked Ring Brotherhood, together with other followers in 1892.|$|E
3000|$|... (1)The {{method is}} <b>rough.</b> This <b>paper</b> makes {{a study of}} the maximum {{watermarking}} payload of spatial domain image under the conditions of invisibility, in another word, the maximum embedding payload. Different area has the different payload capacity. For example, the payload of high roughness and perceptual invisibility areas is higher than the area of low roughness and visual sensitive areas. This article does not do further research of this aspect; it is the deficiency of this article and also further research directions of ours, which is closer to the practical applications.|$|R
50|$|Briefly {{captured}} illustrations {{though these}} lithographs may be, their accuracy and detail, {{together with the}} strength of tonal observation give them a satisfying quality. From his sketches also came the larger watercolours on <b>rough</b> dark <b>paper,</b> distinguished by his characteristic use of blue and sharp white highlights. At their best these are fine, sensitive evocations of the familiar coastline and countryside round his home, contrasting with the exotic scenes he encountered abroad, from the craggy slopes of the Alps and the Andes, to the shining domes of Moscow and Constantinople.|$|R
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 1970s, Enokura stained paper, cloth, felt, and leather with oil and grease. He also discolored the floors and walls of galleries and outdoor spaces. These installations are no longer extant but are documented in photographs. In 1970, Enokura exhibited in Tokyo Biennale ’70 - Between Man and Matter, with Jiro Takamatsu and Susumu Koshimizu. World-renowned artists such as Richard Serra, Jannis Kounellis, Luciano Fabro, Christo and Bruce Nauman also exhibited. There he presented Place (1970), stacks of <b>rough</b> straw <b>paper</b> piled in different heights and soaked with oil.|$|R
50|$|Hunt {{was one of}} {{the creators}} of the English school of {{watercolour}} painting. His subjects, especially those of his later life, are extremely simple; but, by the delicacy, humour and fine power of their treatment, they rank second to works of the highest art only. Considered technically, his works exhibit all the resources of the watercolour painter's craft, from the purest transparent tinting to the boldest use of gouache, <b>rough</b> <b>paper</b> and scraping for texture. His sense of color is perhaps as true as that of any English artist. He was, says John Ruskin, all in all, the finest ever painter of still life. Several characteristic examples of Hunt's work, as the Boy and Goat, Brown Study and Plums, Primroses and Birds' Nests are in the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E
5000|$|Hilder was modest, shy and {{affected}} by illness; this sometimes led to estrangement from his best friends. He was fortunate in his wife, in the admiration {{of his fellow}} artists, and in finding early buyers of his paintings. He was very critical of his own work and tore up much of it; sometimes the final result was {{the third or fourth}} effort to capture the subject. He was not afraid of empty spaces and everything in the drawing was beautifully placed. His colour was always excellent, though some of his later work is painted almost in monochrome washed in on very <b>rough</b> <b>paper.</b> The treatment generally is broad, yet full of refinement and poetical feeling. The best collection of his work will be found at the national gallery at Sydney. He is also represented at the Melbourne, Adelaide and other galleries. The Ewing collection at the University of Melbourne has a good example, [...] "The Island Trader". Ure Smith published a tribute, J. J. Hilder: Watercolourist (1916), with proceeds going to Hilder's widow.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the top is}} the {{lettering}} Dynamo {{sports and}} a box with the comment: [...] "You read today". There are always 4 boxes, which have numbers of certain pages and to highlight the ever changing themes. The number of pages is limited to 8, on thin, <b>rough</b> <b>paper.</b> Color is red and white for {{the highlights of the}} logo [...] "Dynamo sports" [...] and black-red or blue-black for emphasis. The font color of the text is black and available in size 8. The title is from the subject in the newspaper always fat and 18.5 in Arial size. The text itself has the font size Times New Roman in size 9.5. The different themes are always separated by lines or completely framed in the box. The ratio of the text area and the pictures in the square measure is approximately 1:3 for parts of the image, as can be in a tabloid, it has been customary. And so will the whole leaf looks like a sports section of a tabloid newspaper also, and it explicitly but comes to the Dynamo sports, with the reference to the political orientation of the German Democratic Republic. Later, the graphical subdivision of the text boxes, other colors come to the expression, such as yellow-black or green and white. Or there are vertically juxtaposed joists that form this close to a cross a line.|$|E

At first they were printed on a <b>rough</b> handmade <b>paper,</b> but after 1854 a smooth machine-made paper was used instead. Issues between 1858 and 1861 used a profile of Emperor Franz Josef, then switched back to the coat of arms, in an oval frame.
