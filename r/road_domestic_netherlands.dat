50|$|In California, Yellow star-thistle was {{dispersed}} into agricultural fields, {{and immediately}} took {{hold in the}} state's Mediterranean-type climate areas. Human factors, such as mowing, land grading for development and <b>roads,</b> <b>domestic</b> animal grazing, and disturbance of the soil surface for agricultural tillage and wildland firebreaks have and continue {{to contribute to the}} successful thriving and spread of this plant. Yellow starthistle is now a very common sight in vacant lots and fields, along roadsides and trails, in pastures and ranch lands, and in parks, open-space preserves and natural areas. In addition to the United States, starthistle has been introduced throughout Africa, Europe, and North and South America.|$|R

They played a similar symbolic role in ancient China, where dogs were conceived as representative of the household sphere, and as protective spirits appropriate when transcending geographic and spatial boundaries. Dogs were also sacrificed to the road. As Roel Sterckx observes, [...] "The use of dog sacrifices at the gates and doors of {{the living and the}} dead as well as its use in travel sacrifices suggest that dogs were perceived as daemonic animals operating in the liminal or transitory realm between the domestic and the unknown, danger-stricken outside world".|$|R

40|$|With the {{prospect}} of an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the <b>road,</b> <b>domestic</b> charging will be the most obvious way to recharge the vehicles’ batteries. However, this can have adverse impacts to low voltage (LV) distribution grids such as high current demand, increased 3 -phase load unbalance and subsequently higher energy losses. In order to investigate to what extent existing infrastructures can support a gradual introduction of EVs at the residential level and what are the possibilities for distribution energy loss reduction, a complete model of a LV grid was developed. By simulating the interaction of EV users with electricity distribution networks, an insight was created into the energy saving potential but also into the possible barriers that might arise in the short term future. Simulation results show that if the charging process of the EVs’ batteries is left uncontrolled, the introduction of EVs will {{have a negative impact on}} distribution systems in terms of overloaded circuits and increased energy loss. Nevertheless, the concept of electric transportation can provide the means to optimise the use of the distribution grid’s capacity and to minimize energy loss. By controlling the charging process of the vehicles’ batteries, the potential energy savings can be significant. Furthermore, EV technology can play an important role in releasing the distribution system’s capacity and improving system reliability...|$|R

When {{the impact of}} <b>domestic</b> <b>road</b> infrastructure is assessed separately, it has been associated with increased trade. When cross-border and <b>domestic</b> <b>road</b> infrastructure are considered together, the former has had a positive and the latter has had a negative association, respectively, with trade.

40|$|Over {{the past}} year or so, {{practitioners}} of Integrated Rural Accessibility Planning in Laos have held various discussions about what sectors to include in the IRAP planning process. In Laos the IRAP project is presently covering 4 sectors namely rural <b>roads,</b> <b>domestic</b> water supply, primary education and primary health care. Discussions between project staff, local Government staff, donor representatives and rural development project staff concentrated on whether and how IRAP could be expanded to include other aspects of rural development. In particular access issues associated with economic development were often the focus of the discussions. Should IRAP plan for improved market access, irrigation, extension services etc. ? This paper sets out recommendations on how to extend the IRAP methodology and how to incorporate planning for improved access associated with income generating activities. It suggests modifications at two levels: the local Government level and the community level. The recommendations are based on field experience, review of selected literature on rural accessibility and a study commissioned by ILO on “Agriculture and Accessibility”. The paper also suggests what not to include in the IRAP planning process. The paper synthesizes some of the findings of the IRAP project in Lao P. D. R. in relation to “Access and Income Generating Activities (IGA) ”. It examines physical access needs by IGA and questions whether IRAP planning procedures should incorporate specific infrastructure requirements associated with IGA in rural Laos and at what level. This issue-paper on “Income Generating Activities and Accessibility ” is the first one in a series of five. The IRAP project will produce 5 different issue papers in 1998 dealing with the following topics...|$|R
