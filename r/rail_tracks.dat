40|$|German Rail {{maintains}} a global data base where all <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> information is managed in a consistent way. The data base {{is used as}} a reference frame for all facilities. However, rail maintenance work leads to geometrical changes in the situation. The same is true for <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> improvements with respect to a higher design speed. Both activities require updating concepts and procedures for the <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> data base which have to guarantee consistency and a high degree of up-to-date-ness. This is of special importance as all emergency management can only be based on such a valid <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> data base, and the ongoing building activities have to be synchronized with the maintenance activities resulting from the measurements.

5|$|When built, the {{surrounding}} area was composed of dirt roads and private residences. The Southern Pacific Railroad's 1868 west side rail line ran down Fourth Avenue past City Hall and the county courthouse. The city and county governments fought the railroad to remove the dirty and noisy steam locomotives from this route, succeeding in 1912. Southern Pacific's electric interurban line continued on the tracks until the 1930s. In 2007, work began on adding light <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> on Fifth Avenue for the planned MAX Green Line, and trains once again ran past City Hall starting in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Most trains {{that serve}} the Bloor–Danforth line are stored at the Greenwood Subway Yard, which opened {{with the first}} segment of the line. Before the yard was built, the land was {{occupied}} by a quarry and a garbage dump. Due to its location next to the Canadian National Railway tracks, {{it was possible for}} trains to be delivered directly to the subway. The CN <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> were converted to allow for the storage of more subway trains as the T-1 series trains were shifted from Yonge–University–Spadina line to the Bloor–Danforth line. In addition to providing storage for subway trains, the Greenwood yard is also used to maintain vehicles, which operate on Line 3 Scarborough as the McCowan RT Yard is only equipped for vehicle storage and to perform basic maintenance of vehicles.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 16–17 April 1941, the London {{terminus}} was badly damaged in an air raid and rendered unusable. Although the LNC continued to operate occasional funeral services from Waterloo station to Brookwood railway station immediately north of the cemetery, the London Necropolis Railway was never used again. Soon {{after the end of}} the Second World War the surviving parts of the London station were sold as office space, and the <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> in the cemetery were removed. The part of the London building which housed the LNC's offices survives today. The two stations in the cemetery remained open as refreshment kiosks for some years afterwards but were subsequently demolished. The site of the northern station, serving the Nonconformist cemetery, is now heavily overgrown. The site of the southern, Anglican, station is now the location of a Russian Orthodox monastery and a shrine to King Edward the Martyr, which incorporate the surviving station platform and the former station chapels.|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffe {{began its}} eighth {{consecutive}} night of bombing London on 15 September. Soon after midnight, 13 unidentified Dornier Do 17 light bombers attacked the capital. At 00:15 two Junkers Ju 88s followed from Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51, or 51st Bomber Wing). A further 11 Heinkel He 111s from an unidentified unit bombed the city again at 00:50. At 02:00, five He 111s from Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4) bombed the city. A full strike by the Geschwader had been planned, but bad weather had forced a cancellation after five He 111s had taken off. Most {{of the damage}} was done to residential areas in Fulham, Chelsea and Westminster. Around 19 {{people were killed and}} 31 injured. The heaviest casualties were caused when a bomb fell on a church in Chelsea killing 14 and injuring 26. Small raiding forces bombed Cardiff, Bootle (in Liverpool), Leicester and Ipswich. At Bootle, only slight damage was done to <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> and facilities at West Alexandra Dock.|$|E
5|$|The system {{initially}} {{had four}} standard gauge, single tracked lines, which had passing loops to allow trams to pass. Three originated at Stortorvet: the Gamlebyen Line, running east to Gamlebyen (now Old Oslo, but then called just Oslo); the Vestbanen Line, which ran west to Vestbanen station (Oslo West station); and the Ullevål Hageby Line, which ran west to Homansbyen, where the depot was located. In addition, {{there was a}} short connecting line between the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Vestbanen Line, but it was closed on 19 October 1875. The two lines that connected to the station only ran services that corresponded with train arrivals and departures; the other two lines had fixed fifteen-minute headway—decreasing to ten minutes from 22 June 1876. During the winter of 1875 and 1876, the company attempted to use sleds instead of wagons. They took delivery of seventeen units, but these were not as suitable as the wagons and the company instead chose to salt the <b>rail</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} {{has been}} proposed, contingent upon {{the allocation of}} funding. This includes {{the second phase of}} the Silicon Valley extension, which would bring the system to downtown San Jose and Santa Clara. Plans have long been floated for an extension from Dublin to Livermore, which would cost approximately $1.2 billion and run 5.5 miles (8.9 km) along interstate 580 to Isabel Avenue. The BART board could vote in spring 2018 on this project, which would be completed in 2026. Other plans have included an extension to Hercules, a line along the Interstate Highway 680 corridor, and a fourth set of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> through Oakland. At least four infill stations such as Irvington and Calaveras on existing lines have been proposed. With the Transbay Tube nearing capacity, long-range plans included a new four-bore Transbay Tube beneath San Francisco Bay that would run parallel and south of the existing tunnel and emerge at the Transbay Transit Terminal to connect to Caltrain and the future California High Speed Rail system. The four-bore tunnel would provide two tunnels for BART and two tunnels for conventional/high-speed rail. The BART system and conventional U.S. rail use different and incompatible rail gauges and different loading gauges.|$|E

5|$|International District/Chinatown station, {{the southernmost}} tunnel station, is {{partially}} open-air and located immediately below a public plaza at Union Station. The station has connections to Amtrak and Sounder commuter rail at King Street Station a block to the west, accessible through the Weller Street Bridge, {{as well as}} the First Hill Streetcar on Jackson Street, stopping east of 5th Avenue South. Other attractions near the station include CenturyLink Field to the west and Uwajimaya a block to the southeast. South of the station, the light <b>rail</b> <b>tracks,</b> and bus lanes are separated by railway signals at an underground bus layover and staging area next to the tunnel comfort room for bus drivers. The southern portal of the tunnel is located under the intersection of Airport Way and 5th Avenue South at the western terminus of the Interstate 90 express lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. Light rail trains and southbound buses continue from the tunnel in separated lanes on the SODO Busway, while eastbound buses use a ramp that merges with the Interstate 90 express lanes that will be retrofitted for the East Link light rail service in 2023.|$|E
5|$|ZG 26's Bf 110s {{were flying}} near the formation, {{and tried to}} offer JG 3 support by intercepting Crossley's fighters but failed. Crossley led a head-on attack and downed one Do 17 while his {{squadron}} damaged several others. So close had the RAF fighters pressed home their attacks that the bombers had to move and jink to avoid their fire. It put the bomb-aimers off their aim. The Dorniers were already too close to their targets and the pilots could not realign before the formation was over and passed the aiming point. Having been thwarted from bombing their official targets they aimed for <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> {{to the north and}} east of the airfield. Some of the unit targeted RAF Croydon, three miles north-west of Biggin Hill. Others turned around without releasing their bombs. The crews that bombed the rail lines found they were a difficult target to hit at 15,000 feet. Some released their bombs at intervals in the hope of hitting their targets, however some bombs fell on residential property.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company {{was founded}} as the Sewanee Furnace Company, a small mining concern {{established}} in 1852 by Nashville entrepreneurs seeking to exploit Tennessee's rich coal reserves and the 19th century railroad boom. After losing money, {{the business was}} sold to New York investors in 1859 and reorganized as the Tennessee Coal and Rail Company, but {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War the following year saw the fleeting company repossessed by local creditors. It became Tennessee's leading coal extractor over the next decade, mining and transporting coal around the towns of Cowan and Tracy City in the Cumberland Mountains, and soon branched out into coke manufacture. This practice of both extracting and moving coal to market by building private <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> was not unusual at the time, as by owning the tracks that served their mines, businesses could undercut rivals at market by saving money on transportation. A Thomas O'Connor purchased the company in 1876 and expanded the business into iron manufacture in order to stimulate coke sales, building a blast furnace near Cowan. The business was subsequently renamed the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company. TCI never again changed its name, despite a later expansion into Alabama following the 1886 purchase of the Birmingham-based Pratt Coal and Iron Company. Such was the industrial importance of Alabama to TCI that in 1895, the company relocated its offices to Birmingham, relegating its native state to relative unimportance.|$|E
