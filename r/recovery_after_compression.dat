A lower hydrogen concentration also leads to the synthesis of CNT arrays that can reach higher peak stress at maximum compressive strain, and dissipate a larger amount of energy during compression.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the mechanical behavior of 3 D periodically architected metallic glass nanolattices, constructed from hollow beams of sputtered Zr-Ni-Al metallic glass. Nanolattices composed of beams with different wall thicknesses are fabricated by varying the sputter deposition time, resulting in nanolattices with median wall thicknesses of ∼ 88 nm, ∼ 57 nm, ∼ 38 nm, ∼ 30 nm, ∼ 20 nm, and ∼ 10 nm. Uniaxial compression experiments conducted inside a {{scanning electron microscope}} reveal a transition from brittle, catastrophic failure in thicker-walled nanolattices (median wall thicknesses of ∼ 88 and ∼ 57 nm) to deformable, gradual, layer-by-layer collapse in thinner-walled nanolattices (median wall thicknesses of ∼ 38 nm and less).

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to test three {{flexible}} polyurethane foams for mattress for comfort and durability. In particular, they were investigated the effects of foam composition and cell architecture on some physical-mechanical properties of interest for bedding applications and related to foam comfort levels (i. e. surface firmness, hysteresis loss and resistance to bottoming out), and their changes after artificial weathering due to moisture and temperature. The results demonstrated that all the three foams have open cell morphology and similar cell structure, with average cell diameters ranging from 430 to 510 micron and wide cell size distribution. As a consequence, they also show comparable water vapor transport behavior. On the contrary, their mechanical response, in terms of hysteresis loss, surface firmness and resistance to bottoming out, was found strongly dependent on their chemical structure and molecular mobility, as inferred from infrared spectroscopy analysis. During accelerated weathering all the foams undergo oxidations that affected their comfort factors in static conditions, giving a progressive lowering of hysteresis loss, surface firmness and resistance to bottoming out, particularly for the two foams having lower crosslinking level and thus slow <b>recovery</b> rate <b>after</b> <b>compression...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{industrial}} applications, such as {{paper and}} nonwovens, cellulose fibers {{are used in}} the form of a network where the fibers are oriented more or less in the sheet-plane direction. However, in many biological systems, fibers are instead oriented in a three-dimensional (3 D) space, creating a wide variety of functionalities. In this study we created a 3 D-oriented fiber network on the laboratory scale and have identified some unique features of its structure and mechanical properties. The 3 D fiber network sheets were prepared by using foam-forming as well as modifying consolidation and drying procedures. The fiber orientation and tensile/compression behavior were determined. The resulting sheets were extremely bulky (above 190  cm 3 /g) and had extremely low stiffness (or high softness) compared to the reference handsheets. Despite this high bulk, the sheets retained good structural integrity. We found that a 3 D-oriented fiber network requires much less fiber-fiber contact to create a connected (“percolated”) network than a two-dimensionally oriented network. The compression behavior in the thickness direction was also unique, characterized by extreme compressibility because of its extreme bulk and a long initial increase in the compression load as well as high strain <b>recovery</b> <b>after</b> <b>compression</b> because of its fiber reorientation during compression.

The present work explores the ability to process cocoon fibers of non-mulberry Eri silk (Samia/Philosamia ricini) into sponges through a green approach using ionic liquid (IL) â 1 -buthyl-imidazolium acetate as a solvent. The formation of Î²-sheet structures during Eri silk/IL gelation was acquired by exposing the Eri silk/IL gels to a saturated atmosphere composed of two different solvents: (i) isopropanol/ethanol (physical stabilization) and (ii) genipin, a natural crosslinker, dissolved in ethanol (chemical crosslinking). The sponges were then obtained by freeze-drying. This approach promotes the formation of both stable and ordered non-crosslinked Eri silk fibroin matrices. Moreover, genipin-crosslinked silk fibroin sponges presenting high height <b>recovery</b> capacity <b>after</b> <b>compression,</b> high swelling degree and suitable mechanical properties for tissue engineering applications were produced.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} stability of gels applied for entrapment {{and retention of}} biocatalysts in bioreactors is of crucial importance for successful scale-up applications. Gel abrasion in agitated reactors will depend on liquid shear, bubble shear, and wall shear, as well as collisions between the gel particles. As a simplified standardized model system, abrasion of gel beads was studied in 1 -m-high bubble columns with controlled aeration, and quantified by measuring the loss of gel material into solution. Gel beads were also taken out to measure stress-strain response during controlled compression. More general rheological properties of different gels were studied by applying a variety of regimes of controlled compression of standardized gel cylinders: Gel strength was measured by recording the fracture properties and the Young's modulus. Viscoelastic properties were revealed by recording creep during compression as well as <b>recovery</b> <b>after</b> <b>compression.</b> Oscillation tests up to 1000 cyclic compressions were applied to compare the fatigue of different gels. Results obtained for Ca-alginate gels, gels of chemically modified polyvinyl alcohol with stilbazolium groups (PVA-SbQ) as well as mixed gels of Ca-alginate and PVA-SbQ are compared with previously published data for -carrageenan, agar, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) gels. It is concluded that material fatigue rather than mechanical properties such as stiffness or fracture stress should be considered when selecting a suitable gel material {{on the basis of}} abrasion resistance. The very soft and superelastic PVA-SbQ gel showed no significant fatigue in mechanical tests and no abrasion was detected in the standardized model system used. Ca-alginate gels, however, showed severe irreversible changes due to fatigue at oscillating loads and creep at constant load. Due to their similarities with -carrageenan gels in mechanical tests, it is likely that Ca-alginate would also be sensitive to abrasion. Mixed gels of Ca-alginate and PVA-SbQ represent a complex system with intermediate properties, showing significant fatigue and creep, but elastic properties from the PVA-SbQ gel make it less sensitive than the pure Ca-alginate ge...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Elastomer compounds {{have been used in}} pipe seals for many decades, with their main problem, the stress relaxation due to various mechanisms. In these applications, a service life of more than fifty years is expected- and obtained. The purpose of the programme was to establish mathematical models to enable longevity of seals to be predicted from laboratory measurements. It seemed that stress relaxation in compression, together with strain recovery measurements, would provide a basis for such an investigation. Accordingly, such tests were carried out with up to 23 rubber compounds, at temperatures of 5 °, 23 °, 40 °, 70 °, 100 ° and and 125 ° C, with environments of air, mains water and town gas. The work outlined above is the main thrust of the programme, the data obtained being the raw material for the development and assessment of mathematical models associated with the viscoelasticity of the various rubbers. This work has been supported by supplementary investigations, including: effect of loading rate step changes in temperature inclusion (or not) of mechanical working of the specimen before testing use of solid phase lubricant changing the dimensions of the specimen comparison of air environment with water immersion, and town gas comparison of air environment with vacuum and nitrogen An important facet of the work has been the comparison of tensile behaviour with the bulk of the work carried out in uniaxial compression.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{are known}} to have remarkable properties, such as a specific strength two orders of magnitude higher than that of steel. It has remained a challenge, however, to achieve useful bulk properties from CNTs. Toward that goal, here we develop low-density bulk materials (0. 1 - 0. 4 g cm - 3) entirely or nearly entirely from CNTs. These consist of nominally-aligned arrays of CNTs that display a dissipative compressive response, with a notable stress-strain hysteresis. The compressive properties of CNT arrays are examined in detail. This analysis reveals interesting features in the mechanical response, such as strain localization (resulting from a gradient in physical properties along the height), <b>recovery</b> <b>after</b> <b>compression,</b> non-linear viscoelasticity, and behavior under repeated compression that depends on the strain of previous cycles (similar to the Mullins effect in rubbers). We observe that in compression the energy dissipation of these materials is more than 200 times that of polymeric foams of comparable density. Next, materials based on CNT arrays are studied as exemplary of hierarchical materials (materials with distinct structure at multiple length scales). Hierarchical materials have pushed the limits of traditional material tradeoffs (e. g., the typical trend that increased strength requires increased weight). Techniques are developed to separately vary the structure of CNT arrays at nanometer, micrometer, and millimeter length scales, and the effects on the bulk material response are examined. Structure can be modified during CNT synthesis, such as by varying the composition of the flow gas or by manipulating the input rate of chemical precursors; it can also be modified post-synthesis, e. g., by the in situ synthesis of nanoparticles in the interstices of the CNT arrays or by the assembly of multilayer structures of multiple CNT arrays connected by polymeric or metallic interlayers. Finally, a mathematical model is applied to capture the complexities of the mechanical response. This one-dimensional, multiscale, bistable spring model is able to match the global stress-strain response as well as local effects such as strain localization and Mullins-like behavior. A technique is developed to reliably discern the model's material parameters based on in situ optical data from the experiments. </p...|$|E
