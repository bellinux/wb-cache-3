50|$|Rather than {{produce a}} {{transmitter}} {{to match the}} 2B, Drake designed {{a new line of}} equipment beginning with an SSB transceiver, the TR-3, in 1963. Again emphasizing size efficiency, the TR-3 was designed as a complete SSB station in a small package. Other design innovations included crystal bandwidth filters and a permeability tuned oscillator (PTO) capable of extremely linear, stable tuning and a dial resolution of better than 1 kHz across all amateur HF (shortwave) bands. Its size was so small, in part, because the power supply was in a separate chassis, connected to the transceiver with a multi-conductor cable. The AC-3 power supply could be installed inside a matching speaker cabinet, later designated the MS-4. An optional remote VFO (PTO), the RV-3 could be added to the system to enable split frequency operation (i.e., transmitting on a frequency different from the <b>receiving</b> <b>frequency).</b> The RV-3 (and, later, the RV-4) also contained a speaker.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we propose}} a Bluetooth channel state {{dependent}} data segmentation and reassembly (CSD-SAR) scheme and a queue state dependent priority (QSD-PR) scheduling policy. The CSD-SAR maintains a <b>receiving</b> <b>frequency</b> table to predict channel conditions and selects the best packet type and packet size to transmit data. In addition, the QSD-PR also uses the <b>receiving</b> <b>frequency</b> table to avoid bad frequencies {{and gives a}} selected master-slave pair, which has more queued data to send between each other and has a higher priority to eliminate the wastage of slots. The conventional scheduling policy, Round Robin (RR), yields poor performance with the time division duplex (TDD) based MAC protocol and results in slot wastage and may not ensure fairness. Simulation results show that OUT proposed scheme achieves better link utilization and higher throughput with bounded delay compared to the RR scheme in error-free and error-prone environments. Our scheme can also eliminate interference to other wireless networks that share the same spectrum, such as WLANs, by avoiding selecting channels occupied by other network...|$|E

Most junctions exhibited a large emission peak at a voltage which was related to the detection frequency by the second Josephson relation. Typically, for high temperatures, and, therefore, small critical currents, the measured radiation linewidth agreed well with theoretical predictions. In this temperature range, the Josephson junction could be considered as an electrically short junction (w/#lambda#_j# 4), flux motion is responsible for additional noise.
