Two of the four repetitive DNA segments found {{are located in the}} 5 '-flanking region, and one each within the intervening sequences. Each <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>segment</b> contains one to three highly homologous unit sequences with an approximate length of 120 base pairs. All the unit sequences are flanked on the 3 ' side by tandem repeats. There are about 10 (5) copies of the repetitive DNA in the bovine genome. Comparison of the bovine repetitive sequences with those of other mammalian species reveals the presence of a homologous segment of approximately 40 base pairs. This segment and the region preceding it in the bovine repetitive DNA exhibit sequence homology with the region encompassing the origin of DNA replication in papovaviruses...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of Mycobacterium ulcerans has revealed two new insertion sequences (ISs), IS 2404 and IS 2606. IS 2404 was identified by complete sequencing of a previously described <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>segment</b> from M. ulcerans. This element is 1, 274 bp long, contains 12 -bp inverted repeats {{and a single}} open reading frame (ORF) potentially encoding a protein of 327 amino acids (aa), and apparently generates 7 -bp direct repeats upon transposition. Amino acid similarity {{was found between the}} putative transposase and those encoded by ISs in other bacterial sequences from Aeromonas salmonicida (AsIs 1), Escherichia coli (H repeat element), Vibrio cholerae (VcIS 1), and Porphyromonas gingivalis (PGIS 2). The second IS, IS 2606, was discovered by sequence {{analysis of}} a HaeIII fragment of M. ulcerans genomic DNA containing a repetitive sequence. This element is 1, 404 bp long, with 12 -bp inverted repeats and a single ORF potentially encoding a protein of 445 aa. Database searches revealed a high degree of amino acid identity (70 %) with the putative transposase of IS 1554 from M. tuberculosis. Significant amino acid identity (40 %) was also observed with transposases from several other microorganisms, including Rhizobium meliloti (ISRm 3), Burkholderia cepacia (IS 1356), Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Yersinia pestis. PCR screening of DNA from 45 other species of mycobacteria with primers for IS 2404 confirm that this element is found only in M. ulcerans. However, by PCR, IS 2606 was also found in Mycobacterium lentiflavum, another slow-growing member of the genus Mycobacterium that is apparently genetically distinct from M. ulcerans. Testing the sensitivity of PCR based on IS 2404 and IS 2606 primers demonstrated the ability to detect 0. 1 and 1 M. ulcerans genome equivalents, respectively. The ability to detect small numbers of cells by using two gene targets will be particularly useful for analyzing environmental samples, where there may be low concentrations of M. ulcerans among large numbers of other environmental mycobacteria...|$|E

[...] Pathogens that do not live in an isolated environment have been found to contain a large number of insertion sequence elements and various <b>repetitive</b> <b>segments</b> of <b>DNA.</b> The combination of these two genetic elements is thought help mediate homologous recombination.

50|$|Debates {{regarding}} the potential functions {{of these elements}} have been long standing. Controversial references to ‘junk’ or ‘selfish’ DNA were put forward early on, implying that <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>segments</b> are remainders from past evolution or autonomous self-replicating sequences hacking the cell machinery to proliferate.Originally discovered by Barbara McClintock, dispersed repeats have been increasingly recognized as a potential source of genetic variation and regulation. Together with these regulatory roles, a structural role of repeated DNA in shaping the 3D folding of genomes has also been proposed. This hypothesis is only supported by a limited set of experimental evidence. For instance in human, mouse and fly, several classes of repetitive elements present a high tendency for co-localization within the nuclear space, suggesting that DNA repeats positions {{can be used by}} the cell as a genome folding map.|$|R
40|$|A large pericentric {{inversion}} of the X chromosome [inv(X) (p 22. 31 q 26. 3) ] {{was found to}} be transmitted in four generations through phenotypically normal males and females.

Steroid sulfatase (STS), an enzyme which normally escapes inactivation has been located to Xp 22. 32 and, in our case, has been moved to an aberrant position. We have assayed its activity in clones with the inv(X) inactive or the normal X inactive and found no significant differences. Thus, the STS locus escaped X inactivation in both the normal and the inverted X chromosomes.

40|$|Abstract Background Minisatellites are genomic loci {{composed}} of tandem arrays of short <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>segments.</b> A minisatellite map is {{a sequence of}} symbols that represents the tandem repeat array such that the set of symbols is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of distinct repeats. Due to variations in repeat type and organization as well as copy number, the minisatellite maps {{have been widely used}} in forensic and population studies. In either domain, researchers need to compare the set of maps to each other, to build phylogenetic trees, to spot structural variations, and to study duplication dynamics. Efficient algorithms for these tasks are required to carry them out reliably and in reasonable time. Results In this paper we present WAMI, a web-server for the analysis of minisatellite maps. It performs the above mentioned computational tasks using efficient algorithms that take the model of map evolution into account. The WAMI interface is easy to use and the results of each analysis task are visualized.

40|$|Nuclear {{processing}} of mRNA precursors in differentiating multicellular Dictyostelium discoideum aggregates is markedly slower than in growing amoebae. Thus, {{we have been}} able to determine the time of nuclear {{processing of}} individual mRNA species in postaggregating cells by following the incorporation of 32 PO 4 into nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA complementary to cloned cDNAs. Precursors of mRNAs synthesized during both growth and differentiation remain in the nucleus for about 25 to 60 min. By contrast, typical mRNAs which are synthesized only by postaggregative cells have nuclear processing times between 50 and 100 min. Depending on the particular mRNA, between 20 and 60 % of nuclear transcripts are converted into cytoplasmic mRNA. A third class of mRNAs are transcribed from a set of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>segments</b> and are expressed predominantly during differentiation. Nuclear precursors of these mRNAs are extensively degraded within the nucleus or very rapidly after transport to the cytoplasm. Those sequences that are stable in the cytoplasm exit from the nucleus only after a lag of over 2 h. Thus, mRNAs encoded by different genes that are subject to different types of developmental controls display different times of transit to the cytoplasm and different efficiencies of nuclear processing. Differential nuclear processing may contribute to the regulation of the level of individual cytoplasmic mRNAs...|$|R
40|$|Retinoblastoma (RB), a {{childhood}} neoplasia of the retinoblasts, can occur unilaterally or bilaterally, {{with one or}} multiple foci per eye. RB is associated with somatic loss-of-function of both alleles of the tumor suppressor gene RB 1. Hereditary forms emerge due to germline loss-of-function mutations in RB 1 alleles. RB {{has long been the}} prototypic ‘‘model’’ cancer ever since Knudson’s ‘‘two-hit’’ hypothesis. However, a simple two-hit model for RB is challenged by an increasing number of studies documenting additional hits that contribute to RB development. Here we review the genetics and epigenetics of RB with a focus on the role of small noncoding RNAs (microRNAs) and on novel findings indicating the relevance of DNA methylation in the development and prognosis of this neoplasia. Studies point to an elaborated landscape of genetic and epigenetic complexity, in which a number of events and pahtways play crucial roles in the origin and prognosis of RB. These include roles for microRNAs, inprinted loci, and parent-of-origin contributions to RB 1 regulation and RB progression. This complexity is also manifested {{in the structure of the}} RB 1 locus itself: it includes numerous <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>segments</b> and retrotransposon insertion elements, some of which are actively transcribed from the RB 1 locus. Altogether, we conclude that RB 1 loss of function represents the tip of an iceberg of events that determine RB development, progression, severity, and disease risk. Comprehensive assessment of personalized RB risk will require genetic and epigenetic evaluations beyond RB 1 protein coding sequences...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{through which}} exon shuffling occurs {{is by the}} usage of helitrons. Helitron transposons were first discovered during studies of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>segments</b> of rice, worm and the thale crest genomes. Helitrons {{have been identified in}} all eukaryotic kingdoms, but the number of copies varies from species to species. Helitron encoded proteins are composed of a rolling-circle (RC) replication initiator (Rep) and a DNA helicase (Hel) domain. The Rep domain is involved in the catalytic reactions for endonuclelytic cleavage, DNA transfer and ligation. In addition this domain contains three motifs. The first motif is necessary for DNA binding. The second motif has two histidines and is involved in metal ion binding. Lastly the third motif has two tyrosines and catalyzes DNA cleavage and ligation. There are three models of gene capture by Helitrons: the 'read-through" [...] model 1 (RTM1), the 'read-through" [...] model 2 (RTM2) and a filler DNA model (FDNA). According to the RTM1 model an accidental [...] "malfunction" [...] of the replication terminator at the 3' end of the Helitron leads to transposition of genomic DNA. It is composed of the read-through Helitron element and its downstream genomic regions, flanked by a random DNA site, serving as a [...] "de novo" [...] RC terminator. According to the RTM2 model the 3' terminus of another Helitron serves as an RC terminator of transposition. This occurs after a malfunction of the RC terminator. Lastly in the FDNA model portions of genes or non-coding regions can accidentally serve as templates during repair of ds DNA breaks occurring in helitrons. Even though helitrons have been proven to be a very important evolutionary tool, the specific details for their mechanisms of transposition are yet to be defined. An example of evolution by using helitrons is the diversity commonly found in maize. Helitrons in maize cause a constant change of genic and nongenic regions by using transposable elements, leading to diversity among different maize lines.|$|R

The 14 -mer d(G-G-T-T-C-T-G-C-A-T-A-A-T-G) complementary to the coding sequence for His-Tyr-Ala-Glu-Pro, a sequence element occurring in all 38 -residue PRP variants, hybridizes specifically with a 12. 5 -kilobase mRNA which is clearly androgen-controlled. This oligonucleotide was used as an efficient primer {{for the construction of a}} PRP-specific lambda gt 10 cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence of the inserts from several recombinant clones has been determined. This structural analysis revealed a PRP mRNA encoding a large precursor containing a number of tandemly repeated units. Each repeat codes for a sequence of 100 amino acids in which the highly conserved PRP sequence is embedded. From this polyprotein the large number of PRP variants must be generated by a post-translational processing mechanism which is still unknown. The high degree of conservation of both nucleotide and amino acid sequence in the entire unit also indicates that the PRP gene(s) likely evolved by multiplication of a 300 -base pair ancestral DNA sequence.

Conserved characteristics were observed, such as the occurrence of a small number of clusters of rDNAs and U snDNAs, in contrast to the multiple clusters/dispersal of the H 3 histone genes. The positions of U 2 snDNA and 18 S rDNA are also conserved, being intermingled within the largest autosome. The distribution and base-pair composition of the heterochromatin and <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> pools of these organisms differed, suggesting reorganization. Although the microsatellite arrays had a similar distribution pattern, being dispersed along entire chromosomes, as has been observed in some grasshopper species, a band-like pattern was also observed in the E. surinamensis chromosomes, putatively due to their amplification and clustering. In addition to these differences, the genome of E. surinamensis is approximately 2. 5 times larger than that of G. assimilis, which we hypothesize is due to the amplification of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Finally, we discuss the possible involvement of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> in the differentiation of the neo-sex chromosomes of E. surinamensis, as has been reported in other eukaryotic groups. This study provided an opportunity to explore the evolutionary dynamics of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> in two non-model species and will contribute to the understanding of chromosomal evolution in a group about which little chromosomal and genomic information is known...|$|R

One type of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> elements is human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), representing about 1 % of the human genome. Their structures closely resemble those of retroviruses, and include internal sequences with homology to gag, pol, and env open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by long termina...|$|R
