In this paper, {{subspace}} identification {{methods are}} proposed {{to estimate the}} linear tire cornering stiffness, which are only based on the <b>road</b> <b>tests</b> data without any prior knowledge. This kind of data-driven method has strong robustness. In order to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithms, a series of standard <b>road</b> <b>tests</b> are carried out. Comparing with different subspace algorithms used in <b>road</b> <b>tests,</b> {{it can be concluded}} that the front tire cornering stiffness can be estimated accurately by the N 4 SID and CCA methods when the double lane change test data are taken into analysis...|$|R
