25|$|The University of Nantes {{was first}} founded in 1460 by Francis II, Duke of Brittany, but {{it failed to}} become a large {{institution}} during the Ancien Régime. It disappeared in 1793 with the abolition of French universities. During the 19th century, when many of the former universities reopened, Nantes was neglected and local students {{had to go to}} Rennes and Angers. In 1961 the university was finally recreated, but Nantes has not established itself as a large university city. The university had about 30,000 students during the 2013-2014 academic year, and the metropolitan area had a total student population of 53,000. This was lower than in nearby Rennes (64,000), and Nantes is the ninth-largest commune in France in its percentage of students. The university is part of the EPSCP Bretagne-Loire Université, which joins seven universities in western France to improve the region's academic and <b>research</b> <b>potential.</b>|$|E
2500|$|John T. Tate, was an {{influential}} {{professor of physics}} at the University of Minnesota, who was Nier's mentor and editor of the Physical Review. [...] After the war, he recognized the <b>research</b> <b>potential</b> of large plastic balloons, which had been invented by Jean Piccard and were being manufactured at the General Mills Laboratories in the Como neighborhood of Minneapolis. [...] Here, Otto C. Winzen used polyethylene to make balloons whose performance at high altitudes was better than the cellophane ones developed by Piccard. [...] In 1947, because of Ney's interest in cosmic rays, Tate offered him a position as assistant professor, which was immediately accepted. [...] Except for a sabbatical and two brief leaves of absence, Ney spent {{the rest of his life}} at Minnesota.|$|E

2500|$|Aesthetically, the {{appearance}} of Caves House, with its roots in English provincial building practice, is a contrast to the mountainous landscape of the remote Jenolan Valley, its massive limestone arches and craggy cliffs. [...] As the building {{is the work of}} a prominent colonial architect, who was influential in the development of Australian architecture, Caves House attains significance by association. [...] Historically, Caves House illustrates the considerable human activity and ingenuity necessary to provide accommodation {{in the early days of}} Australian tourism, in buildings especially designed for this purpose. [...] Vernon had to employ innovative methods to address problems posed by a major building project in a remote setting. Also, Caves House was built to service one of the earliest protected sites of natural environmental heritage in the world, declared a protected area by the New South Wales government in 1866. Lighting and sewage developments dating from the late 1880s are of significant historical importance, as they were crucial to the development of the remote area as a tourist destination. [...] Caves House has the <b>research</b> <b>potential</b> to provide archaeological evidence about the early development of New South Wales tourism. Along with the caves, it is a rare example of the development of mountain and cave tourism in New South Wales. [...] Also, of historical significance is the fact that in 1889, to provide electricity for the caves (and later, Caves House) Australia's first hydro-electricity plant was built nearby.|$|E
