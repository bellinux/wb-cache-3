40|$|Although {{a number}} of studies have {{associated}} <b>recasts</b> with second language development, the actual mechanisms by which <b>recasts</b> work to impact learning are still little understood. In particular, researchers have sought to gain a deeper understanding of the connections among <b>recasts,</b> learners' responses to <b>recasts,</b> and subsequent development. To this end, the current study examines the impact of <b>recasts</b> and different types of responses on English as a second language (ESL) question development. In a pretest/posttest design, 58 Thai English as a foreign language university students carried out a series of communicative tasks with native English speakers and completed four tests over a 9 -week period. The learners' treatment task data were analyzed for the occurrence of <b>recasts</b> and responses to <b>recasts</b> that targeted developmentally advanced question forms. Their test data were examined for evidence of advancement to a higher stage in the developmental sequence for question formation. Results indicate that <b>recasts</b> were a significant predictor of ESL question development. Learners' responses in the form of primed production of the question forms targeted in the <b>recasts</b> were also predictive of ESL question development, but responses in the form of immediate repetitions of <b>recasts</b> were not associated with development...|$|R
40|$|<b>Recasts</b> are an {{important}} type of implicit negative feedback that has attracted much attention in both L 1 research and SLA research. The utility of <b>recasts</b> in face-to-face interaction has been empirically established, and the contingency of <b>recasts</b> is argued to be the key. However, the efficacy of <b>recasts</b> in computer-mediated communication (CMC), text-based online chatting in particular, remains questionable due to the possible violation of this contingency factor in the 'split negotiation routines' commonly observed in CMC discourse. This study used a repeated-measure design to examine {{the potential impact of}} the contingency of <b>recasts</b> on noticing as well as some contextual factors that might mediate the contingency effect on the noticing of <b>recasts.</b> In this study, 17 ESL learners were invited to chat with one researcher on two dyadic communication tasks, one preceded by prewriting and the other without. Think aloud protocols and stimulated recalls were used to measure the noticing of <b>recasts.</b> It was found that participants noticed contingent <b>recasts</b> significantly more often than noncontingent <b>recasts.</b> Furthermore, working memory and prewriting were found to mediate the contingency effect, and learner proficiency level was found neither pertinent to the noticing of <b>recasts</b> nor mediative of the contingency effect. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The use of <b>recasts</b> has better effects than modeling, any type of input enhancement, and elicitations; nevertheless, teachers should be selective regarding the type of error to which <b>recasts</b> are apply; facilitator, as feedback provider, and learner as receptor, are influenced by the nature of the conversation in which they are involved.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. In the {{previous}} research on <b>recasts,</b> two interesting claims have been made. First, the absence of learners' immediate responses following <b>recasts</b> may limit the effectiveness of <b>recasts,</b> and therefore other interactional feedback moves that encourage uptake, such as prompts or negotiation, would be more beneficial for learners than <b>recasts.</b> In response to this claim, some researchers have argued that <b>recasts</b> might have delayed effects on L 2 development, and thus the efficacy of <b>recasts</b> should not be discounted {{due to the lack}} of immediate responses (Mackey & Philp, 2003; McDonough & Mackey, 2006). The second claim is that, among the many operational definitions of <b>recasts</b> utilized in previous studies, the more explicit ones may be more effective than the more implicit ones (Ellis & Sheen, 2006; Nicholas, Lightbown, & Spada, 2001), since the former lead to a higher rate of learner uptake and repair (Loewen & Philp, 2006; Sheen, 2006) as well as greater noticing of the <b>recasts</b> (Egi, 2007; Kim & Han, 2007). These two issues are investigated in this study examining the effects of explicit (i. e., declarative) and implicit (i. e., interrogative) <b>recasts</b> on L 2 development of Korean relative clauses. In total, 63 KSL/KFL learners at the beginning-high to intermediate level participated in this study. The impacts of explicit and implicit <b>recasts</b> are examined with respect to various learner responses in the discourse (i. e., immediate uptake and primed production) as well as subsequent L 2 development, measured on two different occasions (i. e., immediate and delayed posttests) by employing three different tasks (i. e., an oral production task, a sentence combination task, and a grammaticality judgment task). The results showed that all three groups (i. e., declarative, interrogative, and control groups) significantly improved over time as a result of the interaction they engaged in during the experiments, regardless of the explicitness of the <b>recasts</b> and even the presence or absence of <b>recasts.</b> However, significantly higher repair rates followed declarative <b>recasts,</b> supporting the argument that declarative <b>recasts</b> are more explicit than interrogative ones. With regard to the relationships between the various learner responses and L 2 development, only primed production was significantly associated with posttest scores...|$|R

40|$|Hong Kong {{secondary}} school students often lack the procedural knowledge of using English grammar in speaking, though they possess the relevant declarative knowledge from their education. Students' tenseless L 1 and lack of L 2 exposure {{could have been the}} reasons. The present study therefore investigated if individualized feedback on students' use of past tense in their spoken narratives would facilitate their development. <b>Recasts</b> were chosen as the target feedback, because they intertwine with the ongoing speaking flow and provide model reformulation to ease learners' online cognitive load. However, controversies over the effectiveness of <b>recasts</b> lie on their variable explicitness and implicitness. Moreover, research, to date has not sufficiently examined both the explicit and implicit implementation of <b>recasts</b> in the context of Hong Kong. As a result, the present study explored the immediate and overtime effectiveness of implicit and explicit <b>recasts</b> over no feedback on Hong Kong learners' use of past tense in their spoken narratives elicited from cartoon strips. The comparative effectiveness of the two <b>recasts</b> was also probed. Investigation into some students' perception towards the feedbacks was conducted through stimulated recalls, to suggest causes behind the different effectiveness of <b>recasts.</b> The study found that both <b>recasts</b> were more effective than no feedback on past tense in the short term. Opposite to what was hypothesized, only the effectiveness of implicit <b>recasts</b> sustained overtime; and both <b>recasts</b> were not significantly different from each other at any time.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the effects of negotiated interaction on the production and development of question forms in English {{as a second language}} (ESL). The study focused on one feature of interaction, <b>recasts,</b> which have recently been the topic of interactional work in the SLA literature (Long, 1996; Long, Inagaki, & Ortega, this issue; Lyster & Ranta, 1997; Oliver, 1995). The study compared groups of learners who received interactionally modified input with learners who received the same input containing intensive <b>recasts</b> in order to investigate: (a) the effect of <b>recasts</b> on learners' short term interlanguage (IL) development, and (b) the nature and content of learners' responses to <b>recasts.</b> The results suggest that for more advanced learners, interaction with intensive <b>recasts</b> may be more beneficial than interaction alone in facilitating an increase in production of targeted higher-level morphosyntactic forms. These positive developmental effects were found for <b>recasts</b> even though, as is generally acknowledged in the discourse, <b>recasts</b> were usually not repeated and rarely elicited modification by the learners. This study, therefore, suggests that <b>recasts</b> may be beneficial for short term IL development even though they are not incorporated in learners' immediate responses. In fact, the responses may be red herrings...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that <b>recasts</b> may be {{contingent}} responses to children's early ungrammati-cally. On this basis, it has been claimed that <b>recasts</b> provide negative evidence, thereby offsetting the need for linguistic constraints in theories of acquisition. This study explores whether children exploit negative evidence putatively provided by <b>recasts</b> by examining whether parental <b>recasts</b> are associ-ated with children's recovery from particular overgeneralization errors. Data from longitudinal in-vestigations of 2 common syntactic errors reveal that <b>recasts</b> are related to children's subsequent grammaticality. However, contrary to what would be expected if <b>recasts</b> serve as corrections, {{the data show that}} <b>recasts</b> are negative leading indicators of grammaticality. Finally, correction and negative evidence axe examined and are shown to be nonequivalent. Therefore, corrections in whatever form they might exist can offset only a limited subset of proposed innate constraints on language acquisition. In the course of development, children may at times adopt grammars that appear to be overgeneral with respect to the lan-guage they are acquiring. For example, children learning En-glish may alternate between using and omitting articles preced...|$|R

Analysis and comparison of the features accompanying <b>recasts</b> and noncorrective repetition show that teachers in this study do use different features when providing <b>recasts</b> or noncorrective repetition. Specific features identified significantly more frequently with <b>recasts</b> (pointing to mouth in a certain position, leaning or moving toward student, stress, over-enunciation of one word or sound, and reduction) serve to highlight the corrective purpose of <b>recasts.</b> On the other hand, the features more often accompanying noncorrective repetition (written support on board or overhead, rising intonation, expansion, and praise) support different purposes such as rebroadcasting an utterance, confirming or acknowledging a student's response, or requesting more information...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of <b>recasts,</b> a frequently provided type of oral feedback in language teaching, on the production of English question forms in second language (L 2) learning. Despite {{the large number of}} studies which have examined the effects of <b>recasts,</b> mixed views exist as to their usefulness as a corrective feedback technique. The present study has continued the investigation into whether their frequent use is justified and also if learners actually perceive <b>recasts</b> as being corrective in nature. The focus {{of this study is to}} explore developmental effects, both immediately following and delayed, of <b>recasts</b> while considering these two key aspects. The primary aim is to explore delayed benefits of <b>recasts</b> while the secondary aim is to investigate whether or not these learners perceived the feedback as a correct version of their incorrect question form. The study involved 34 English as a second language (ESL) learners from various first language (L 1) backgrounds who were enrolled in a general English programme, at an Auckland language school. The participants completed demographic questionnaires and took part in task-based interaction sessions, with the members of the experimental group receiving input containing intensive <b>recasts.</b> The proportion and types of questions produced in the immediate and two delayed post-tests were compared and analysed to consider whether exposure to <b>recasts</b> was beneficial. The main findings suggest that for more advanced question types, interaction with intensive <b>recasts</b> may be more effective than interaction alone, for delayed L 2 development, despite only weak support in the literature. On the other hand, similar positive effects on immediate question production are not strongly evident. Therefore, the results in this study add support to the claim that <b>recasts</b> may be beneficial for delayed second language acquisition (SLA), when the linguistic target is questions, even when these <b>recasts</b> do not seem effective immediately following exposure. Furthermore, awareness of negative evidence was indicated, which may have contributed, in part, to the positive delayed findings. Finally, these results suggest that <b>recasts</b> can be an effective pedagogical tool in the communicative L 2 classroom when providing linguistic feedback in a way that does not unduly disrupt the flow of the interactive task. Practical suggestions for future research were also identified...|$|R

40|$|<b>Recasts,</b> {{a type of}} {{implicit}} corrective feedback, {{are thought}} to be capable of drawing learners’ attention to mismatches between their non-target-like items and the corresponding target forms. While a great many studies have tried to compare the effectiveness of <b>recasts,</b> few have attempted to determine whether learners actually notice the language forms used in the <b>recasts.</b> The present study has sought to bridge this gap by investigating the extent to which beginning learners actually notice the morphological and syntactic changes that occur in <b>recasts</b> of their non-target-like utterances in the context of dyadic oral interaction. The participants in the study, two Korean beginning learners of English, received intensive <b>recasts</b> of their morphological and syntactic errors over a period of four months.

40|$|Recent SLA {{research}} has found that <b>recasts</b> on morphosyntactic features are more effective in form-focused classrooms than in meaning-based classrooms. Based on this understanding, it is hypothesized that there is a positive correlation between the effectiveness of <b>recasts</b> on morphosyntactic features and the amount of attention learners pay to form. This paper reports on a preliminary study that tests this hypothesis through administering a sequence of communicative tasks, designed to promote different degrees of attention to form and meaning. The tasks differed as to (a) the extent of learners’ familiarity with task content and (b) the intrinsic capacity of the task to draw attention to form. The study observed both learners’ uptake and perception of <b>recasts</b> through the tasks. The data collected consisted of transcripts of the participants’ task-based interactions and stimulated recall sessions. The results show that both the amount of uptake after <b>recasts</b> and the accurate perception of <b>recasts</b> are positively correlated with the amount of attention learners devote to form during task-based interaction. The preliminary study, therefore, suggests that learners’ familiarity with task content along with the intrinsic capacity of a task to promote attention to form can increase the effectiveness of form-focused <b>recasts...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to identify within-treatment factors that might account for the variability observed in the intervention outcomes of children with specific language impairment (SLI) who received <b>recasting</b> therapy. Audio-recorded sessions of 16 children receiving intervention for third person singular –s were transcribed and coded according to four clinician-related and four child-related parameters. Pearson r correlational analyses and linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship of these parameters with midpoint and final probe scores and to identify short- and long-term predictors of participant progress. Two variables, frequency of noncorrective <b>recasts</b> and grammaticality of child utterances, were found to be positive predictors of outcomes whereas simplicity of <b>recasts</b> and frequency of clinician third person singular subject/bare stem nonfinite verb productions were negative predictors. These results suggest that children who receive more noncorrective <b>recasts</b> and produce more grammatical utterances make better progress in therapy while children who receive a greater number of simple <b>recasts</b> and are exposed to more third person singular subject/bare stem nonfinite verb combinations have poorer outcomes. It appears that gains in therapy are greater when <b>recasts</b> are distinguishable from child platform utterances in meaning and form and when all direct or indirect affirmation of erroneous child productions are eliminated. ...|$|R
