Thirteen clones were selected from base population to study the herb growth yield characters and oil production as well as genetic parameters, correlation and regression. Results were recorded for herb growth characters (i. e. plant high (PH), no. of tillers (NOT), dry yield (DY), viability percentage (VP) and oil production. Significant variation was observed among citronella clones in base population for most studied traits.

Sections of muscle tissue under light microscope revealed hemorrhage and congestion of blood vessel during initial stage followed by extensive muscle fiber necrosis with elevated levels of serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activity. Malabarin also exhibited strong procoagulant action and its procoagulant action is due to thrombin like activity; it hydrolyzes fibrinogen to form fibrin clot. The enzyme preferentially hydrolyzes A alpha followed by B beta subunits of fibrinogen from the N-terminal region and the released products were identified as fibrinopeptide A and fibrinopeptide B by MALDI. The myonecrotic, fibrinogenolytic and subsequent procoagulant activities of malabarin was neutralized by specific metalloprotease inhibitors such as EDTA, EGTA and 1, 10 -phenanthroline but not by PMSF a specific serine protease inhibitor.

This has entailed a descriptive analysis of boater 2 ̆ 7 s socio-economic profiles, facilities and equipment, preferences and attitudes, and activity patterns. Concomitantly a test of the hypothesis that boating is not a homogenous recreational activity was attempted. Two statistical analyses were carried out. The first test was to determine whether the profiles of boaters having different activity specialities differed. This was accomplished by finding the means of selected boater characteristics (i. e., income, children, length of boat) for each boating speciality. The L. S. D. multiple means comparison test was then used to determine if a statistically significant difference existed between the means of each activity. The second test determined whether the effect of selected boater characteristics on activity levels was the same when regressed on the three dependent variables of hours fishing, hours skiing, and hours pleasure boating. Boaters were found to have higher incomes, more education and higher percentages of household heads working in the highest paying professional, technical, and managerial occupations. The results of the multiple mean and regression analysis support the hypothesis that boaters specialyzing in the different boating activities are not homogeneous. Boaters specializing in water skiing, pleasure boating and fishing were found to take different types of boating trips, have different socioeconomic levels, and own different kinds of boating equipment.

Gender inequality lower {{quality of life and}} culminates in limited productivity, hinder economic efficiency and growth. For over three decades, gender issues have been at the front burner of international summits. In spite of much progress in recent times, gender inequalities remain pervasive in many dimensions of life in various regions around the world particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Treatment of women is yet to be fairer and related policies can be more effective to improve the status of women. No-doubt studies have been carried out on gender inequality, but less emphasis has been <b>raveled</b> with respect to hindrances and implications of gender inequality. Hence, understanding the nature of gender inequality will not only promote sound awareness among African countries, but also ignite government efforts as well as NGOs toward effective interventions for reduction of gender inequality especially in the economic and political realms where women are made worse off by the socio-cultural milieu. The methodological approach to this paper was based on reviews of published multiple documents to draw up statistical profile of the situation of women in selected countries of low human Development index in SSA to show the existence of gender inequality. The paper found among all the 12 low human development countries and SSA region examined that gender indicators such as human development index, expected years of schooling, mean years of schooling, estimated gross national per capita, share of seats in parliament, population with at least secondary education and labor-force participation rate are all in favor of men.

40|$|A {{study of}} the interplanetary sector {{structure}} at heliographic latitudes up to 16 øN is reported. The study is based on magnetic field measurements made on board Pioneer 11 as the spacecraft <b>raveled</b> along the post-Jupiter-encounter trajectory. Preliminary measurements are {{used to determine the}} dominant polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field during 43 successive solar rotations including Pioneer's ascent to its maximum latitude and motion inward from 5 to 3. 7 AU. As the latitude of Pioneer increased, the dominant polarity became continually more positive, corresponding to an outward-directed solar inter-planetary field. When the spacecraft reached the highest latitude, the usual sector structure had essentially disappeared. A histogram of the field longitude angle, based on data acquired during 1 month at 16 ø latitude, shows an almost total absence of inward-directed fields. A comparison with interplanetary field polarities in the ecliptic, as inferred from geomagnetic field variations, rules out the possibility that a time variation rather than a latitude dependence is responsible. The Pioneer 11 observations imply that the boundary between adjacent sectors corresponds physically to a current sheet surrounding the sun and lying nearly parallel to the solar equatorial plane. Above this current sheet, in the northern hemisphere, the field polarity at this phase of the solar cycle is outward, and below the current sheet, in the southern hemisphere, it is inward. The Pioneer observations confirm earlier theoretical suggestions regarding the existence and equatorial orientation of this current sheet. The properties of the current sheet and some major implications and questions associated with it are discussed. It is shown that the radial component of the sheet current is compensated by the distributed currents in the northern and southern hemispheres associated with the spiraled interplanetary field...|$|E
40|$|Although Germany 2 ̆ 7 s colonial project {{lasted only}} 30 years, {{the impact of}} {{colonialism}} on metropolitan institutions continued long after. Germany entered overseas imperialism in 1884 with race-thinking hardly discernible in official policy or public debate. By the time Germany lost its colonies in 1919, however, race-thinking had permeated most of the political parties and had come to define a host of state health initiatives. How do we account for such a dramatic shift {{in such a short}} period of time? Studies of the sciences and medicine have begun to answer this question, but a focus on scientific inquiry cannot fully explain how race entered the political and public spheres. ^ This dissertation examines the unintended long-term impact of colonialism on German political culture by looking at the political experiences of African colonial subjects in Germany from 1884 to 1945. When African colonial subjects <b>raveled</b> to the metropole, they raised questions about their legal status that became occasions for public commentary on colonialism, state power, violence, and race. Because they continued to raise the question of the nature of their belonging even after Germany lost its colonies in the First World War, their stories offer us one of the most direct ways of measuring the development of race-thinking in metropolitan state practice before 1933. This study shows that race-thinking became an operative principle in German political culture as a consequence of colonial domination. The Bismarkian state {{set the stage for the}} entrée of race-thinking into official policy by failing to define colonial subjects as anything but the pure objects of state will, as “nobody 2 ̆ 7 s people. ” Colonial administrators on the ground could therefore treat them with great violence, while colonial reformers at home were at pains to explain this violence according to German traditions. A particular “race power” complex emerged from this dynamic of atrocity, scandal and reform, which did not remain neatly in the colonies, but came to influence the programmatic ideas of radical racists when they imagined German expansion eastwards. ...|$|E
