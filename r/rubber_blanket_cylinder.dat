Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber blanket, which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or offset to the <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder,</b> this reproduction method is known as offset lithography or offset printing.|$|E

[...] The name was taken from the <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket</b> used to transfer ink from the printing plates to the printing surface in offset printing. The title was meant to indicate that the printing process was integral to the work published therein.|$|R

Blanket-to-blanket presses are considered a perfecting press because they print {{on both sides of the}} sheet at the same time. Since the blanket-to-blanket press has two <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinders</b> per colour, making it possible to print on both sides of a sheet, there is no impression <b>cylinder.</b> The opposite <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinders</b> act as an impression cylinder to each other when print production occurs.

5000|$|It {{is unclear}} when {{or how the}} roll developed. Nothing like {{it can be found}} in Mexico (the source of much cowboy equipment, notably the saddle, bridle, lariat, chaps, wide-brimmed hat, high-heeled boots, and spurs), or in the Southern United States, the birthplace of many cowboys. However, one item just predating the [...] "Cowboy" [...] era that was very {{familiar}} to most Cowboys, many of whom were American Civil War (ACW) veterans, was the Confederate soldier's rolled bedding that was carried slipped diagonally over one shoulder and tied together just over one hip. A vital part of this [...] "bedding roll" [...] was the [...] "rubber blanket", a rectangle of heavy canvas with brass eyelets at the corners and edges, that was heavily coated with vulcanized [...] "Goodyear" [...] latex rubber. Each Federal soldier was issued one, but both sides write of having acquired two or more, either through capture or acquisition on the battlefield. This <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket</b> was carried rolled around the rolled-up wool blanket and served as a groundcloth (or sunshade, or hasty tent,) or any other purpose the soldier could devise. This <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket</b> was very waterproof and made it possible for the soldier to sleep relatively dry {{for the first time in}} the history of warfare. Prior to this time, most soldiers of the world's regular armies, may or may not have been issued a wool blanket. Very crude groundcloths of [...] "painted canvas" [...] were sometimes secured by the soldier themselves, but at best, the soldier could count on waking wet and cold. In the ACW, the usual practice was to spread one <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket</b> on the ground, arrange the wool <b>blanket</b> on the <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket,</b> and, if available, spread a second <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket</b> on top of the wool blanket. The soldier slept directly on the <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket,</b> uncoated side up, and the wool blanket over the recumbent soldier. In practice, it almost duplicated the Cowboy Bedroll. The addition of the waterproof tarp of the Cowboy Bedroll may well have descended from this source.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Synchronization {{torsion bar}} {{is a key}} part in {{independent}} and dependent impression mechanism which ensures synchronization motion {{at both ends of}} <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Due to frequent action of the mechanism in high-speed printing, synchronization torsion bar would cause huge impact torque so as to affect parallel shifting of <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder</b> and uniformity of printing impression. Based on structure features and force of synchronization torsion bar, finite element model of synchronization torsion bar was established by adopting structural mechanics and finite element method, then static stiffness of synchronization torsion bar was solved by adopting principle of minimum potential energy. The result of computation shows that the maximum torsion deformation of torsion bar in X direction happens at the left connection point. Because the deformation is very small, the bar can meet the requirements that <b>blanket</b> <b>cylinder...</b>|$|R
