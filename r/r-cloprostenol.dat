40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare two different intervals for the implementation of treatment of chronic endometritis in dairy cows. A field trial was conducted on two commercial dairy farms, in Brandenburg, Germany. Endometritis was defined as vaginal discharge and classified into three categories. In total 1377 cows were examined by rectal palpation for signs of endometritis between 20 to 26 days post partum (check 1) and classified into two groups. The overall prevalence of chronic endometritis was 28. 7 % (n = 281). In group 'Early' 123 cows with signs of endometritis were treated with 0. 075 mg of <b>R-cloprostenol</b> (PrelobanÂ®, Intervet Germany GmbH) twice in a 14 day interval, starting at day 20 to 26 post partum. In group 'Later' an identical treatment was used but with a later start. Cows (n = 158), which were diagnosed with endometritis at the time of check 1, were not treated but re-examined two weeks later. By the time of the second examination (34 - 40 dpp, check 2) 106 out of 158 cows were diagnosed as clinically healthy and therefore not treated. 52 cows with signs of endometritis at check 1 and 2 received two treatments of 0. 075 mg of <b>R-cloprostenol</b> in a 14 day interval, starting at 34 - 40 days post partum. For the analysis of ovarian activity a blood sample was taken before the first and the second PGF 2 &# 945;-injection for the analysis of progesterone. A concentration of 1. 0 ng/ml progesterone was considered indicative of an active corpus luteum. Prevalence of chronic endometritis at day 20 to 26 was 24. 6 % and 43. 1 % on farm A and B, respectively (p 0. 05). Differences could be demonstrated between the farms. A significantly better conception rate was found for cows of group 'Later' on farm B in comparison to farm A. Numerically the best results regarding reproductive performance showed the non-treated cows from farm A and the treated cows of group 'Early' from farm B. Spontaneous cure between check 1 and 2 for all cows with endometritis but not treated was 67. 1 %. There were differences between the farms, too. Spontaneous cure was a lot higher on farm A as on farm B (71. 7 % vs. 57. 7 %). The reproductive performance of the non-treated cows was similar to the cows of group 'Early'. The analysis of the progesterone concentration in the blood showed that a corpus luteum could be diagnosed more often with extended time to calving. A significant influence of the cyclicity on the therapeutic efficacy could not be determined at the time of the treatment...|$|E
40|$|Native PGF 2 a and its analogs {{have been}} used in the horse mare to {{manipulate}} ovarian activity, primarily as luteolytic agents toinduce estrus. Despite numerous studies on the effects of these luteolysins in the mare, to date only a single investigation has beenconducted in the jenny. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the response of the corpus luteum (CL) to a single dose of PGF 2 a given 3 days (72 h) after ovulation and to establish the plasma progesterone (P 4) profile from pre-treatment to post-treatment ovulation inthe Martina Franca donkey. Twenty-two jennies were ultrasonographically monitored and treated 72 h after the detection ofovulation with 0. 075 mg i. m. of <b>R-cloprostenol.</b> From the day of ovulation until ovulation post-treatment, blood was collected dailyfor P 4 determination by enhanced luminescence immunoassay. All the jennies except one, exhibited behavioral signs of PGF 2 ainducedestrus within 4 days of treatment lasting 5. 4 1. 16 days. Post-treatment ovulation was also hastened, reducing theinterovulatory interval (9. 6 days). In response to treatment, plasma P 4 concentrations fell to estrus levels and then remained constantuntil the next ovulation in all but the non-responding animal. Our findings indicate that PGF 2 a treatment on Day 3 post-ovulationcauses the functional regression of the CL in the jenny, reflected both by the rapid induction of estrus and ovulation and by an abruptdrop in circulating P 4 concentrations.

40|$|Cloprostenol is a {{synthetic}} prostaglandin F analogue. It is a FP (Prostaglandin F) receptor agonist, which shows 2 &# 225; powerful luteolytic effects. It also stimulates the contraction of uterine and bronchial smooth muscle and produces vasoconstriction in some vessels. Anoestrous {{may be due}} to some conditions like abnormal pregnancy, early pregnancy, pyometra, endometritis, retention of placenta, maceration and mummification. So, get rid of this conditions cloprostenol is widely used. It has been now in vogue to administer PGF or its analogue in early 2 &# 225; postpartum cows and buffaloes in order to hasten early resumption of cyclic ovarian activity and thereby to increase the reproductive efficiency. To improve reproductive efficiency, it is necessary to inseminate cows early in the breeding season so that, thereby achieving a more compact calving season. Breeding efficiency is increased by means of synchronization of estrus, conception rate and pregnancy rate. Estrus synchronization can be achieved by lysis of corpus luteum by administration of prostaglandin (PGF) or its synthetic analogue on 5 - 17 2 &# 225; days of the estrus cycle. The cows will return to estrus within 3 - 5 days. The effective therapeutic doses for cloprostenol are 500 &# 956;g in cattle and 175 &# 956;g in pigs. However, for <b>R-cloprostenol,</b> the recommended doses are: 150 &# 956;g in cattle and 75 &# 956;g in pigs. In both cases, it is administered by the intramuscular route. [Vet.
