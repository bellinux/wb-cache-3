40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the ideas involved in implementing an imaging radar simulator based on using modern computer graphics hardware. Recent technologies were heavily used, like vertex and fragment shaders, reaching performances up to 90 Hz {{on a standard}} workstation. For greater realism, <b>radar</b> <b>shadows</b> were generated, implementing shadow map techniques in the programmable graphics hardware. Furthermore, a Phong-like approach (Phong, B. T., “Illumination for Computer Generated Pictures,” Communications of the ACM, Vol. 18, No. 6, June 1975, pp. 311 – 317) is presented for modeling the bidirectional reflectance distribution function of the mean normalized radar cross section.

The new model is intuitive by making use of categories of diffuse and specular reflections.

40|$|Intercomparison of {{backscatter}} {{collected by}} SAR sensors at heterogeneous radar look angles {{gives rise to}} highly variable ground areas being associated with each pixel location within a radar geometry (slant or ground range) image. Many elements within a digital elevation model (in map geometry) can be mapped to a single location in the radar image (range / Doppler coordinates). An image simulation technique uses a faceted high resolution elevation model to integrate all backscatter returned to each range and Doppler location in the radar image (incorporating knowledge of local <b>radar</b> <b>shadow).</b> Modelling the imaging process in this manner, a map of illuminated area is produced in radar geometry, and used to normalize the true backscatter returned by the radar sensor. Although <b>radar</b> <b>shadow</b> must be considered specially, no extraordinary treatment is required of layover regions, as they are correctly accounted for by integration of the illuminated area. The image simulation approach improves on the conventional consideration of 2 D incidence angles, as the 3 D configuration defining the illuminated area (in both the range and azimuth dimensions) is captured. RADARSAT images acquired over Switzerland are used to demonstrate the benefit of such normalization for thematic interpretation. A high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) with 25 m pixel spacing is used as input to the image simulation. The deterioration of the normalization with progressively poorer input DEMs is studied empirically to gauge the required DEM resolution for acceptable normalization of images acquired over pre-alpine topography...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} used {{techniques}} to classify the Wet Snow Zone (WSZ) in SAR imagery is {{the application of a}} knowledge-based algorithm with altimetric and backscattering thresholds. We propose the additional use of a synthetic image threshold by rationing summer and winter sigma linear images in order to identify this glacier facie based on its seasonal variations. The study area is the Antarctic Peninsula, which is a region where some {{of the most}} spectacular changes in glacial systems have happened for the last decades. In the proposed algorithm we used altimetric, backscattering and image ratio thresholds from previous studies. The input data were ENVISAT ASAR wideswath imagery, acquired in winter 2006 and summer 2007, the RAMP digital elevation model, and coastline and rock masks from the Antarctic Digital Database. These images were post-classified by a 5 x 5 focal majority filter, masked by rock outcrop data and the remaing areas of Antarctic Peninsula were classified as Dry Snow Zone (DSZ). The ratio threshold allowed discriminating WSZ from DSZ, <b>radar</b> <b>shadows</b> and transitional areas between this glacier facie and percolation zones, which would be classified incorrectly if only altimetric and backscattering thresholds had been used. Using these three thresholds simultaneously, we can detect the WSZ extension more accurately, which is an important parameter into models to estimate runoff variations, to predict its impacts on coastal environments, and their contribution to sea-level rise.

This paper {{demonstrates}} {{a method to}} elucidate potential erosivity (PE) of cliV strata that fall within the <b>radar</b> <b>shadow</b> of European Remote Sensing (ERS) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. ERS- 1 imagery of cliV faces in Israel’s Negev Desert that faced àway ’ from the satellite look direction contained alternating grey/black stripes that corresponded to the sedimentological units {{that make up the}} cliVs. High return values or digital numbers (DN) relate to gently sloping surfaces with softer lithologies that yield higher rates of weathering. Conversely, lower return values (DN) represent steeper surfaces with harder lithologies that yield a slower rate of weathering. Backscatter and Z-score values were extracted from the image to derive an index of PE for strata at the feature and sub-feature level. This method may be used to determine relative erosivity of cliV strata, compliment existing geological mapping techniques and re ® ne topo-graphical representation of cliV faces in existing digital elevation models (DEMs). 1...|$|E
