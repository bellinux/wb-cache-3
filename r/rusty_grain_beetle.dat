40|$|BACKGROUND: The recent {{development}} {{of very high}} resistance to phosphine in <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens), seriously threatens stored-grain biosecurity. The aim was to characterise this resistance, to develop a rapid bioassay for its diagnosis to support pest management and to document the distribution of resistance in Australia in 20072011. RESULTS: Bioassays of purified laboratory reference strains and field-collected samples revealed three phenotypes: susceptible, weakly resistant and strongly resistant. With resistance factors of > 1000 x, resistance to phosphine expressed by the strong resistance phenotype was higher than reported for any stored-product insect species. The new time-to-knockdown assay rapidly and accurately diagnosed each resistance phenotype within 6 h. Although less frequent in western Australia, weak resistance was detected throughout all grain production regions. Strong resistance occurred predominantly in central storages in eastern Australia. CONCLUSION: Resistance to phosphine in the <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> is expressed through two identifiable phenotypes: weak and strong. Strong resistance requires urgent changes to current fumigation dosages. The development of a rapid assay for diagnosis of resistance enables the provision of same-day advice to expedite resistance management decisions. (c) 2012 Commonwealth of Australia.

40|$|Bin {{test with}} barley A protein-rich pea flour {{obtained}} from Parrheim Foods Ltd. (Saskatoon, Canada) was toxic and repellant to stored-grain insects (Bodnarky et al. 1999). Rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae) {{was the most}} sensitive insect, followed by <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> (Cryptolestes ferrugineus) which was more susceptible than red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum). Insects held on wheat and barley showed similar sensitivities to pea protein, whereas insects held on maize were less sensitive. Granary tests were conducted from late August until late October. Granaries were filled with approximately 10 t of barley and treated with 0. 1 % pea protein (entire grain bulk), 0. 5 % pea protein (top half only) or untreated (2 granaries/treatment). Rice weevil, <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and red flour beetle {{were placed on the}} top surface of the grain (ca. 2 adults of each species/kg barley).

40|$|Soundly based {{implementation}} of {{integrated pest management}} strategies of stored wheat relies on education and accessibility to research information. The present extension project proposal concerns the validation of a decision support tool, which may provide grain elevator managers with information about the seasonal variation in flight activity of store-product insects. This information is important for making decisions of when to fumigate stored products, because if fumigation is conducted shortly before time periods with comparatively high insect flight activity, then the managers {{run the risk of}} facing insect re-infestations of the grain after the fumigation.

40|$|Abstract—A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} effect of liquid nitrogen aeration on mortalities of adult Cryptolestes furrugineus, <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetles,</b> in a prototype cardboard grain bin equipped with an aeration system. The grain bin was filled with Hard Red Spring wheat and liquid nitrogen was introduced {{from the bottom of}} the bin. The survival of both cold acclimated and unacclimated C. furrugineus was tested. The study reveals that cold acclimated insects had higher survival than unacclimated insects under similar cooling conditions. In most cases, mortalities of as high as 100 % were achieved at the bottom 100 cm of the grain bin for unacclimated insects for most of the trials.

40|$|Managing stored {{grains and}} seed {{requires}} {{the use of}} various techniques to ensure the quality of the product entering the storage facility does not deteriorate over time. These techniques include: the use of sanitation, storing sound, dry grain, managing temperature and aeration, using chemical protectants, regular sampling, and the use of fumigation. Bin and storage facilities also {{play an important role in}} determining the quality of the stored grain. Storage facilities should be inspected regularly for deterioration of any type. Proper storage moisture varies depending on type of seed, length of storage and storage conditions. Seed moisture content changes until equilibrium is established with the surrounding environment. The equilibrium moisture is different for each kind of seed. High oil content seeds (soybeans, peanuts, sunflowers) will not absorb as much moisture as seed with a high starch content (wheat, barley, corn, sorghum). Oil does not absorb water; therefore, in a seed with 40 % oil the seed moisture will be concentrated in the other 60 %. The time to reach equilibrium will vary from days to months depending on the kind of seed, humidity and temperature. When there are large differences in seed moisture and the surrounding environment the initial change is rapid and slows as equilibrium temperature/moisture is approached. Over 60 species of insects infest stored grains.

Stored grain {{temperatures}} and population dynamics of <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetles,</b> Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens), predicted by {{a hot spot}} model, which included feedback from the insect model to the temperature model, and a spatial model, which did not include that feedback, were compared. For an initial grain temperature of 30 C and an initial population of 10, 000 adult insects in stored grain at Winnipeg, Canada, the hot spot model predicted a maximum of 120 adults/kg of wheat {{at the center of}} the grain bulk toward the end of fall and a maximum temperature of 39 C. The spatial model predicted an adult population of 500 adults/kg of wheat and no increases in temperatures. For the same simulation conditions but using weather data for Topeka, Kansas, the hot spot model predicted a maximum of 150 adults/kg of wheat {{at the center of the}} bulk in fall, while the spatial model predicted a maximum of 800 adults/kg.

Mitochondrial COI sequences {{are useful for}} providing initial indications in delimiting species but, despite acknowledged limitations in the method, many studies involving COI sequences and species problems remain unresolved.

This species has become strongly resistant to phosphine, a fumigant used worldwide for disinfesting grain. The possibility of cryptic species would have significant consequences for resistance management, especially if resistance was confined to one mitochondrial lineage.

40|$|Abstract-The {{development}} {{and evaluation of}} appropriate sampling plans are needed for cost-effective management of stored-product insects. Sequential sampling plans, {{which are based on}} a variable sample size, are generally more cost effective than plans based on a fixed sample size. For adults of the <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle,</b> Crypfofestes ferrugineus (Stephens), we developed sequential sampling plans based on complete counts and the presence/absence of insects in 0. 5 kg grain samples removed with a trier from the top 1 m of wheat stored in farm bins. Insect count data were used to develop a sampling plan for estimating the density of C. ferrugineus with a fixed level of precision. The presence/absence data were used to develop a sampling plan for classifying the C. ferrugineus infestation level relative to an action threshold. The performance of these sampling plans was evaluated (validated) using independent data sets and an IBM-PC software program specifically designed to test the plans.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{efficacy}} of spinosad on hard white winter wheat was evaluated {{in the laboratory}} by exposing 25 adults of six species of beetles or 50 eggs of two moth species to 100 g of untreated wheat and wheat treated with spinosad at the rates of 0. 1, 0. 5, and 1 mg(AI) /kg. Spinosad was more effective against insects at 1 mg(AI) /kg than at 0. 1 and 0. 5 mg(AI) /kg. All lesser grain borers, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.); <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetles,</b> Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens); rice weevils, Sitophilus oryzae (L.); maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky; and> 94 per cent of the red flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum Herbst; and confused flour beetles, Tribolium confusum (Jacquelin du Val), were killed after 14 days of exposure to spinosad at 1 mg(AI) /kg.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Temperature {{profiles}} {{and insect}} populations were compared in wheat {{that had been}} aerated with low airflow rates during the summer in addition to two autumn aeration cycles, versus wheat aerated in autumn only or unaerated wheat. Tests were conducted in 2000 - 2001, 2001 - 2002, and 2002 - 2003, and data were analyzed separately for each year. Grain mass temperature profiles at depths of 0. 9 and 1. 8 m from the surface in the grain mass showed distinct declines in temperature for each aeration cycle {{during the first two}} years of the study, however, summer aeration did not result in as large of temperature declines in 2002 - 2003, partly because the summer aerated bin was loaded with warmer grain. The effectiveness of summer aeration was estimated using confined insect populations in tube cages placed on the surface of the grain and by sampling the grain for natural insect populations using pitfall probe traps. At the conclusion of the summer aeration cycle, the number of lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius), red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), and rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) in the tube cages were consistently lower in bins that had not been aerated during the summer.

40|$|The neogregarine, Mattesia oryzaephili, is {{pathogenic}} {{for several}} stored-grain pest insects, including the sawtoothed grain beetle, Ory-zaephilus surinamensis, and the <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cryptolestes ferrugineus. It also infects their respective bethylid parasitoids, Cephalono-mia tarsalis and Cephalonomia waterstoni. Male wasps do not attack the beetle larvae {{and do not}} become infected, but the disease is transmitted per os to nearly all female wasps when they paralyze or feed on infected hosts. The mean survival time of infected female C. tarsalis after exposure to heavily infected O. surinamensis was 20. 0 days, while that of healthy C. tarsalis was 38. 0 days. For C. water-stoni females, the mean survival times were 36. 1 days when infected and 45. 9 days when uninfected. The long survival time of infected wasps fosters oviposition and inoculum deposition in the hosts ’ habitat. The wasps sting and bite infected host larvae and sometimes ovi-posit. Wasp progeny that are deposited on infected host larvae rapidly succumb to M. oryzaephili. Two-hour wasp conWnement with pat-ently infected larvae resulted in no transmission from C. waterstoni to C. ferrugineus and 4 % transmission from C. tarsalis to O. surinamensis.

PhillipsThe <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) (Coleoptera: Laemophloeidae), is a {{very common}} {{worldwide}} pest of stored grains. The orientation of C. ferrugineus beetles to various semiochemicals was studied in both the laboratory and field. In laboratory experiments glass two-choice pitfall bioassay dishes were used. Mixed-sex populations of beetles responded positively and significantly to cucujolide I and II separately and in combination compared to controls. Bioassays using the two aggregation pheromones of the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae). Dominicalure 1 and 2 together elicited unexpected significant attractive responses by C. ferrugineus as did assays with the synthetic pheromones from other species. Bioassays showed that C. ferrugineus were not attracted to either corn meal or rolled oats, but they were attracted to commercial grain-based lures and also to ethanol, a natural fermentation product from grains. Several bioassays were conducted to test the attractiveness of naturally produced beetle volatiles to C. ferrugineus, but these showed no orientation to volatiles from either the beetles or their food only. Field tests were conducted in Kansas to test attractiveness of the synthetic pheromones cucujolide I and II in lures together with wheat versus wheat only as a control using Lindgren funnel traps. Field tests in 2014 with cucujolide II pheromone lures showed a significant response by feral C. ferrugineus when tested against wheat.

40|$|The insecticidal {{effect of}} Temprid, a {{formulation}} that contains beta-cyfluthrin and imidacloprid, was tested on concrete {{for control of}} seven stored-product insect species: the <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens); the sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.); the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst); the confused flour beetle, T. confusum Jacquelin du Val; the hide beetle, Dermestes maculatus (DeGeer); and the psocids Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel and L. paeta Pearman. Temprid, which contains 10. 5 % beta-cyfluthrin and 21 % imidacloprid, was tested {{at the rate of}} 17. 2 ml of formulation/ 4. 1 liters of water/ 100 m(2). Adults were exposed for 4, 8, 14, and 24 h, and then daily for 7 d, on untreated dishes or dishes treated with Temprid. In the untreated dishes, mortality of C. ferrugineus and O. surinamensis was lower when food was present, but food did not affect mortality of the other species. Presence of food did not affect mortality of any of the species tested in the treated dishes. C. ferrugineus, O. surinamensis, and the two psocid species were very susceptible to Temprid, with mortality of 97 - 100 % after 7 d of exposure. In contrast, D. maculatus, T. castaneum, and T. confusum were tolerant to Temprid, as mortality did not exceed 57, 25, and 17 %, respectively, at the 7 -d exposure. A separate series of similar bioassays with Tempo, a formulation that contains 11. 8 % beta-cyfluthrin alone, which was applied at the same dose rate as Temprid, was conducted using O. surinamensis and T. castaneum as the target insect species, and results showed that Tempo was at least as effective as Temprid.

40|$|Sulfuryl {{fluoride}} (SF), {{an effective}} structural fumigant, is registered recently as Profume™ for controlling insect pests of stored grains and processed commodities. Information on its effectiveness in disinfestation of bulk grain, however, is limited. The ongoing {{problem with the}} strong level of resistance to phosphine has been addressed recently through deployment of SF as a ‘resistance breaker’ in bulk storages in Australia. This paper discusses important results on the efficacy of SF against key phosphine- resistant insect pests, lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominca, red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae and the <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cryptolestes ferrugineus. We have established CT (g-hm 3) profiles for SF against these insect pests at two temperature regimes 25 and 30 °C, that showed that both temperature and exposure period (t) has significant influence {{on the effectiveness of}} SF than the concentration. Over a seven days fumigation period, CTs of 800 and 400 g-hm 3 achieved complete control of all the target pests, including the most strongly phosphine - resistant species, C. ferrugineus at 25 and 30 °C, respectively. Results from four industry scale field trials involving currently registered rate of SF (1500 g-hm 3) over 2 – 14 d exposure period, confirmed its effectiveness in achieving complete control of the target pest species. The assessment of postfumigation grain samples across all the test storages indicated that the reinfestation occurs after three months. Monitoring resistance to phosphine in C. ferrugineus over a six year period (2009 – 2015), showed a significant reduction in resistant populations after the introduction of SF into the fumigation strategy at problematic storage sites.

The strains were purified for susceptibility, weak resistance and strong resistance to phosphine, respectively, to ensure homozygosity {{of resistance}} genotype. Crosses were established between S-strain × Weak-R, S-strain × Strong-R and Weak-R × Strong-R, and the dose mortality responses to phosphine of these strains and their F 1, F 2 and F 1 -backcross progeny were obtained. The fumigations were undertaken at 25 °C and 55 % RH for 72 h. Weak-R and Strong-R showed resistance factors of 6. 3 × and 505 × compared with S-strain at the LC 50. Both weak and strong resistances were expressed as incompletely recessive with degrees of dominance of − 0. 48 and − 0. 43 at the LC 50, respectively. Responses of F 2 and F 1 -backcross progeny indicated the existence of one major gene in Weak-R, {{and at least two}} major genes in Strong-R, one of which was allelic with the major factor in Weak-R. Phenotypic variance analyses also estimated that the number of independently segregating genes conferring weak resistance was 1 (nE = 0. 89) whereas there were two genes controlling strong resistance (nE = 1. 2). The second gene, unique to Strong-R, interacted synergistically with the first gene to confer a very high level of resistance (~ 80 ×). Neither of the two major resistance genes was sex linked. Despite the similarity of the genetics {{of resistance to}} that previously observed in other pest species, a significant proportion (~ 15 to 30 %) of F 1 individuals survived at phosphine concentrations higher than predicted. Thus it is likely that additional dominant heritable factors, present in some individuals in the population, also influenced the resistance phenotype. Our results will help in understanding the process of selection for phosphine resistance in the field which will inform resistance management strategies. In addition, this information will provide a basis for the identification of the resistance genes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} a potential new method, solid phase microextraction (SPME) for detecting insect infestation in stored wheat. The {{results show that}} volatile pheromones isolated from the common stored grain insects {{can be used to}} indicate infestation. The amounts of pheromone released varied between species. This resulted in different sensitivity when SPME was used for detection. A single specimen of lesser grain borer, LGB (Rhyzopertha dominica) and red flour beetle, RFB (Tribolium castaneum) could be successfully detected in 1 kg of wheat whereas groups of 15 and 20 of <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle,</b> RGB (Cryptolestes ferrugineus Stephen) and flat grain beetle, FGB (Cryptolestes pusillus Schonherr) male beetles were required to be detected in the same quantity of grain. Extraction period and temperature affected the sensitivity of SPME method. Longer exposure time and higher temperature allowed more analyte to be collected. Consequently extraction for 4 h at 50 °C appeared to be the condition for extracting pheromone produced by the beetles covered by this study. The method was further adjusted to suit industrial condition and this resulted in changing the sensitivity. Detection of a single LGB can still be successfully achieved whereas for the remaining species, the minimum number of insects required had to be increased by about 40 - 60 % in order to detect VP in headspace. Method validation was conducted for LGB. The validation showed acceptable results since the method presented linear calibration curve, high accuracy, low detection limit and was specific to the pheromone of LGB. However, poor precision was observed due to matrix interferences. This was improved by using standard addition method. SPME {{can also be used to}} quantify the LGB pheromone by internal standard technique but no significant difference of pheromone amount produced relating to increased number of insects was observed. Therefore, it may not be used to predict the size of the population present in the matrix. Instead, a range of concentration can be established to estimate the population. Lastly, SPME also demonstrated potential to be used in the larger scale where a total of 7 males insects can be detected in 20 kg of grain...|$|E

40|$|Spinosad is a reduced-risk {{insecticide}} {{derived by}} fermentation {{from the soil}} actinomycete, Saccharopolyspora spinosa Mertz & Yao. Spinosad is currently registered in several countries as a grain protectant at a maximum labeled use rate of 1 ppm (1 mg a. i. /kg of grain) and with the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) or tolerance on grains set at 1 or 1. 5 ppm. Global launch of spinosad as a grain protectant is expected in the near future, pending final acceptance of international residue tolerances for spinosad by major grain importing and exporting countries. Spinosad effectively controls economically important beetle and moth pests associated with stored grain and is also effective against certain psocid species. Spinosad provides grain protection through control of adult and/or immature life stages of pest insects. The pest spectrum of spinosad under commercial grain storage conditions is still being defined, {{but it is clear}} from available laboratory and field evaluations on various grains that the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.); larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus (Horn); <b>rusty</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle.</b> Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens); flat grain beetle, Cry ptolestes pusillus (Schonherr); red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst); confused flour beetle. Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val; Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner); rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton); Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier); almond moth. Cadra cautella Walker; and the psocid species Lepinotus reticulatus Enderlein and Liposcelis entomophila (Enderlein) are susceptible to spinosad and complete control is to be expected. Other pest species such as the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motchulsky; rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L); and sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L) are susceptible to spinosad to varying degrees, but their overall level of control remains to be verified under commercial grain storage conditions. Spinosad residues are highly stable on grains stored in bins, with a length of protection ranging from 6 months to 2 years. Numerous factors have been shown to impact the overall performance of spinosad, including insect pest species, pest life stage, grain type, grain variety, and formulation type. Spinosad possesses a unique mode of action in insects and controls insect strains resistant to other grain protectants. When launched globally, spinosad will represent a valuable new addition to the limited arsenal of grain protectants and can positively impact global food security. Its combination of high efficacy, broad insect pest spectrum, low mammalian toxicity, and sound environmental profile is unique among existing products currently used for stored-grain protection.

40|$|Flat <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> (FGB) {{is a major}} {{emergency}} plant pest (EPP) of stored grain in Australia. Populations of FGB have recently developed high level resistance to phosphine (the only viable fumigant available for non-quarantine use) resulting in control failures with current dosage regimes. As there is no practical alternative to phosphine, failure to control FGB with phosphine places at risk market access for Australian grain worth up to 7 billion in annual trade. Therefore there is an urgent need to develop appropriate phosphine fumigation protocols to eradicate outbreaks of strongly resistant FGB. Research outcomes: - Characterisation of high resistance to phosphine in flat <b>grain</b> <b>beetles</b> (FGB) {{for the first time}} internationally. - Establishment of fumigation protocols and an eradication strategy that will enable industry to eradicate infestations of phosphine-resistant flat <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and prevent or delay further selection for resistance to phosphine. - Development of a rapid test to detect highly resistant FGB. -Facilitate continued market access of Australian grain...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1959 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the performance of four species of stored <b>grain</b> <b>beetles</b> in competition at three levels of moisture and temperature. The insects used in these tests were the granary weevil, the rice weevil, the saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and the red flour beetle. The experiments were conducted at temperatures of 90, 80, and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and at moisture levels of 15, 12, and 9 percent moisture content in two varieties of commercial wheat. Redmond variety commercial feed wheat was used for the majority of these tests. Several of the tests were duplicated using Idaed variety seed wheat. The competition studies were designed to test the performance of one species of <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> when reared in the presence of one or two other species. The procedure used was to obtain 50 adult insects of each species from stock cultures. These insects were picked at random and introduced into 250 gram samples of wheat in one pint containers and allowed to remain for one week. The initial adult population was then removed and the adult progeny were counted periodically to determine the size and time of appearance of the first generation. The following combinations of insects were tested: 1. Granary weevil and saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> 2. Granary weevil and red flour <b>beetle</b> 3. Saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and red flour beetle 4. Granary weevil, saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and red flour beetle 5. Rice weevil and saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> 6. Rice weevil and red flour beetle In addition to these combinations, all species of insects were reared alone in each test in order to compare the performance of the insects when in pure culture and when in competitive situations with the other species. The rice weevil was the best competitor of the four species and was less influenced by the presence of other species of beetles. The rice weevil has a wide range of temperature and moisture tolerance and, though considered a tropical species, it is a common and successful pest of stored grain in the Pacific Northwest. The granary weevil was a good competitor because of its capacity to attack whole grains but did riot do as well as the rice weevil, probably because of its lower reproductive rate and longer life cycle. The granary weevil and the rice weevil were well adjusted to the conditions of these tests because of their ability as primary feeders in whole grain. Competition between weevils and bran bugs (the sawtoothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and the red flour beetle) usually favored the bran bugs since the weevils chewed up the grain and made food material available to the bran bugs. In competition with weevils, the bran bugs usually appeared earlier than the former but ordinarily had smaller populations. In competition between bran bugs, the red flour beetle was almost always the dominant species. This was because of the ability of the red flour beetle to attack whole wheat grains and because of its extensive predation of the eggs and pupae of the saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle.</b> The saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and the red flour beetle usually produced larger populations {{in the presence of the}} rice weevil than when with the granary weevil. Where conditions of high temperature and moisture were present in the grain, mold often formed. The presence of the mold may have been favorable to the two species of bran bugs. It has been observed that when the granary weevil or the rice weevil is reared alone under high moisture conditions, there is considerable mold growth. When, however, the weevils are reared in the presence of one or two species of bran bugs, little or no mold is found. It is not known if the bran buns actually feed ori the mold but the results of these tests indicate that both species of bran bugs either feed on the mold or in some way inhibit its formation in grain at high moisture and. temperature levels. This work was performed as part of regional project WM- 16 (maintaining marketability of stored wheat through the control of insects) and was conducted under an assistantship granted by Oregon State College, Department of Entomology, Corvallis, Oregon...|$|R
