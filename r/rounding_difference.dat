50|$|The {{atomic mass}} or {{relative}} isotopic mass {{refers to the}} mass of a single particle, and is fundamentally different from the quantities Standard atomic weight, which refers to averages (mathematical means) of naturally occurring atomic mass values for samples of elements and both are dimensionless values because of division by 1 u (i.e., mass is made relative to the unit). Most elements {{have more than one}} stable nuclide; for those elements, such an average depends on the mix of nuclides present, which may vary to some limited extent depending on the source of the sample, as each nuclide has a different mass. (However, a typical value can be established, which is called the standard atomic weight.) By contrast, atomic mass figures refer to an individual particle species: as atoms of the same species are identical, atomic mass values are expected to have no intrinsic variance at all. Atomic mass figures are thus commonly reported to many more significant figures than atomic weights. Standard atomic weight is related to atomic mass by the abundance ranking of isotopes for each element. It is usually about the same value as the atomic mass of the most abundant isotope, other than what looks like (but is not actually) a <b>rounding</b> <b>difference.</b>|$|E

As a consequence, Debreceni VSC won the Hungarian National Championship I 2009-10 despite losing to Kecskeméti TE in the last round.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The European Economic Union (EEU) {{adopted a}} single currency, the “euro” on January 1, 1999. Such a {{development}} has far-reaching implications {{for development of}} information systems, the engines {{that will have to}} run and control the new monetary order. For example, euro-compliant systems will need to accommodate: (1) six decimal places, a major change for those companies in countries that did not require decimal places (e. g., Belgium and Italy), or even those that require only two, (2) “triangulation ” between curren-cies rather than classic inversion, (3) multiple currencies for each transaction, and (4) differ-ences between invoice amounts and amounts actually paid, since there can be <b>rounding</b> <b>differences</b> on conversions with triangulation. These changes are just the surface require-ments for the euro currency change. Because the euro problem is very new, few companies have begun, let alone completed making, their euro systems changes. As a result, limited research is available regarding the euro. The {{purpose of this article is}} to help fill this void by examining the principal issues of the euro’s impact on information systems and to identify research opportunities related to the euro problem...|$|R

40|$|MuayThai is {{a combat}} sport {{with a growing}} {{international}} profile but limited research conducted into judging practices and processes. Problems with judging of other subjectively judged combat sports have caused controversy at major international tournaments that have resulted in changes to scoring methods. Nationalistic bias has been central to these problems and has been identified {{across a range of}} sports. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine nationalistic bias in MuayThai. Data were collected from the International Federation of MuayThai Amateur (IFMA) World Championships held in Almaty, Kazakhstan September 2003 and comprised of tournament results from 70 A-class MuayThai bouts each judged by between five and nine judges. Bouts examined featured 62 competitors from 21 countries and 25 judges from 11 countries. Results suggested that nationalistic bias was evident. The bias observed equated to approximately one <b>round</b> <b>difference</b> between opposing judges over the course of a bout (a mean of 1. 09 (SE= 0. 50) points difference between judges with opposing affilations). The number of neutral judges used meant that this level of bias generally did not influence the outcome of bouts. Future research should explore other ingroup biases, such as nearest neighbour bias and political bias as well as investigating the feasibility adopting an electronic scoring syste...|$|R

50|$|Each tie in the {{knockout}} phase, {{apart from}} the final, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home.

If aggregate scores finish level and goal difference are equal, then the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progresses. If away goals are also equal, 30 minutes of extra time are played.

50|$|The {{range to}} the target is {{measured}} or estimated as precisely as conditions permit and correct range estimation becomes absolutely critical at long ranges, because a bullet travels with a curved trajectory and the sniper must compensate for this by aiming higher at longer distances. If the exact distance is not known the sniper may compensate incorrectly and the bullet path may be too high or low. As an example, for a typical military sniping cartridge such as 7.62×51mm NATO (.308 Winchester) M118 Special Ball <b>round</b> this <b>difference</b> (or “drop”) from 700 to(-) 800 m is 200 mm.
