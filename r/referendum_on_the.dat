5|$|Brown and the Labour {{party had}} pledged {{to allow a}} <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> EU Treaty of Lisbon. On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband {{attended}} for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty. Brown's opponents {{on both sides of}} the House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give British public a <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> original EU Constitution. Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{continued}} to be dogged by controversy about not holding a <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> EU Treaty of Lisbon. On the morning of 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband stood in for Brown at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty, which was attended by all other European heads of government. At the time, Brown was appearing before the Liaison Committee; he went to Portugal to sign the treaty that afternoon. Brown was criticised by opponents {{on both sides of}} the House and in the press. His critics said that neither Brown nor Labour had a mandate to ratify the treaty without public consent. Conservative leader David Cameron pointed to Labour's 2005 manifesto, which had pledged to give the British public a <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> original EU Constitution. Brown said the Treaty differed on significant points from the Constitution and was no longer a constitution but an ordinary treaty, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E
5|$|Corzine {{spent some}} $200,000 {{of public funds}} on {{advertisements}} to promote a <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 2007 New Jersey ballot to borrow $450million to fund stem cell research. The referendum faced strong opposition and was rejected {{despite the fact that}} $270million had previously been approved to build stem cell research centers.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War {{there have}} been a number of {{attempts}} to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether. A notable <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal. A similar referendum, called for before, but held shortly after the 11 September attacks in the US, was defeated by over 78% of voters.|$|E

5|$|Following these events, Bourassa {{proclaimed that}} a {{referendum}} would occur in 1992, with either sovereignty {{or a new}} Constitutional agreement as the subject. This prompted a national <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Charlottetown Accord of 1992, a series of amendments that included the proposals of Meech Lake as well as concerns of the broader Canadian federation. The Accord failed in Quebec and English Canada.|$|E
5|$|On 3 May 2012, Bristol held a <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} of a directly elected mayor replacing one elected by the council. There were 41,032 votes in favour of a directly elected mayor and 35,880 votes against, with a 24% turnout.

5|$|The package's {{acceptance}} was {{put into}} doubt on 31 October when Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou announced that a referendum would be held so that the Greek people would have the final say on the bailout, upsetting financial markets.

5|$|Alley {{was one of}} the few {{figures who}} were trusted by {{northern}} and southern Dahomeyans alike. His role was only temporary, until power was to be ceded back to civilians in six months time. Among the events on the official timetable, which the military published on January 17, 1968, was the creation of a nonmilitary Constitution Commission on January 31, which would write a new Dahomeyan constitution. The document granted Alley strong executive power, and was adopted by the Comite Militaire Revolutionaire, Alley's interim government comprisising only military officers, in early March. A national <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> constitution was held on March 31, which passed with 92 percent in favor.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{spent the}} early 1840s {{attending}} to his tanning business, but also {{found time to}} encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence. In 1842, he and his allies succeeded in getting the city government in Portland to require licenses for liquor dealers and to prosecute unlicensed sellers; a <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> question was decided in the prohibitionists' favor later that year. The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow kept up his speaking efforts around the state, despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} election, the Referendum Party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith had been {{suffering}} from pancreatic cancer, and had been warned that competing the election would shorten his life. Goldsmith died in Benahavis, Spain on 18 July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members transformed into the Democracy Movement, a pressure group {{closely associated with the}} former Conservative supporter and multi-millionaire businessman Paul Sykes. The Eurosceptic cause was weakened, however; with Blair's firmly pro-EU government in power, by 1998 the possibility of a <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> UK's membership of the EU was considered as distant as it had been in 1995.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3643, {{making the}} {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana a Class C misdemeanor, which added a possible jail sentence of up to 30 days. According to Eric Schlosser of Rolling Stone, John Kitzhaber, then Oregon's governor, signed the bill {{because he did not}} want to appear soft on crime. Activists opposing HB 3643 collected twice as many signatures as were required to force a <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bill. John Sperling, Peter Lewis, and George Soros were the principal financial backers of the referendum signature drive. Measure 57, which would have upheld HB 3643, was turned down by a margin of 2â€“1.|$|E
5|$|In Part II of the 1978 Spanish constitution, among {{provisions}} {{concerning the}} Crown, Article 62(a) invests the sanction (i.e. Royal Assent) and promulgation of laws with the monarch of Spain. Chapter 2 of Part III, concerning the Drafting of Bills, outlines the {{method by which}} bills are passed. According to Article 91, the monarch shall give his or her assent and promulgate the new law within fifteen days of passage of a bill by the Cortes Generales. Article 92 invests the monarch {{with the right to}} call for a <b>referendum,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advice {{of the president of the}} government (commonly referred to in English as the prime minister) and the authorisation of the cortes.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007 Labour Party {{leadership}} election, Benn {{backed the}} left-wing MP John McDonnell in his unsuccessful bid. In September 2007, Benn {{called for the}} government to hold a <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> EU Reform Treaty. In October 2007, at the age of 82, and when it appeared that a general election was about to be held, Benn reportedly announced that he wanted to stand, having written to his local Kensington and Chelsea Constituency Labour Party offering himself as a prospective candidate for the seat held by the Conservative Malcolm Rifkind. However, there was no election in 2007, and the constituency was subsequently abolished.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2011, the ICCL {{said the}} {{information}} provided to voters in advance of polling in two constitutional <b>referendums</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Twenty-ninth Amendment and Thirtieth Amendment was [...] "tardy and inadequate". and advocated a 'no' vote <b>on</b> <b>the</b> proposed Thirtieth Amendment.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>referendums</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{right to}} work and tariffs were popular initiatives, whilst <b>the</b> <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> trade was a {{mandatory}} referendum. Both types required a double majority; {{a majority of the}} popular vote and majority of the cantons. The decision of each canton was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vote in that canton. Full cantons counted as one vote, whilst half cantons counted as half.|$|R
5000|$|Irish {{neutrality}} {{is similarly}} debated; the state's [...] "traditional policy of military neutrality" [...] is not defined in law, and <b>referendums</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Nice and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Lisbon {{were lost in}} part because of fears these would undermine Irish neutrality.|$|R
5|$|Reed's {{leadership}} in dealmaking with Senate Republicans kept the 1956 {{version of the}} flag off Perdue's statewide <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flag in 2003. The referendum was originally a two-part referendum pitting the 2001 version of the flag against the proposed version and conditional on failed ratification of a new flag considering other flags including the 1956 version. Under this format if the legislators did not approve the newly designed flag over the existing one they could have pursued other designs including {{the one with the}} controversial 1956 version of the flag. Reed and a contingent of black legislators from Atlanta limited the referendum to a single vote of preference between the 2003 version and the 2001 version.|$|E
5|$|A statewide <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballot {{that day}} {{continued}} the work begun {{by the new}} city charter in asking voters to consolidate {{the city and county}} governments in Philadelphia. In 1854, all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County had been consolidated into one city, but many county offices still existed, duplicating the efforts of city officials. The merger would also bring county offices under the civil service protections of the new city charter. Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum, but in 1951 the question was overwhelmingly approved. Two other ballot proposals authorized the city to borrow $17 million for municipal improvements and $14 million for the gas works; both passed by a five-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|After Lukashenko {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} in 1994, he stated his intention to amend the recently passed Constitution. The amendments, according to Lukashenko, would expand {{the power of his}} office, marking a turning point in post-Soviet era politics in Belarus. A May 1995 national referendum was {{the first step in the}} amendment process. Out of the four questions, one asked if the president could disband parliament if the members violate national law. The vote, which several Supreme Soviet deputies protested, resulted in 77% in favor of the provision regarding the dismissal of the legislature by the president. Other questions on the ballot, such as the national flag and national emblem, didn't affect the Constitution as a whole, but their status has been decided by the Constitution. Two years later, Lukashenko scheduled the first referendum that would potentially alter the Constitution. The last <b>referendum</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Constitution occurred in 2004, also scheduled by Lukashenko.|$|E
