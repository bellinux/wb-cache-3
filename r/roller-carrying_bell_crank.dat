50|$|Most {{prevalent}} work {{principle for}} CSH is <b>Bell</b> <b>Crank</b> Mechanism. The <b>Bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever rotates around the Fulcrum point. One {{end of the}} <b>Bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever {{is connected to the}} pipe ‘P’, the other end is connected to the spring by the tie rod. Thus when the pipe moves down from cold to hot condition, the point P moves down, and as it moves down the <b>Bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever will rotate in the anti clock wise direction & tie rod connected to the spring will be pulled in, by which the spring gets further compressed. When the pipe moves up the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever will rotate (in the clock wise direction) & the tie rod connected to spring will be pushed out thus allowing the spring to expand or relax.|$|R
50|$|The {{short drive}} shaft {{operated}} a screw sleeve, which extended {{to work a}} <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> The <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> turned a transverse shaft fitted with an eccentric cam, which would push or pull the pivot clamp, thus moving the rocket forward or aftward along its centreline.|$|R
25|$|On Novelty, the {{cylinders}} were mounted vertically towards {{the rear of}} the engine (to the right {{of the men in the}} illustration). Directly below were <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> which changed the drive to horizontal. Connecting rods linked the <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> to the crank axle (the axle on the left in the illustration).|$|R

40|$|An Automatic jack can {{be easily}} {{operated}} by using of pneumatic cylinder which is operated by compressed air cylinder. The jack assembly will be mounted on both the sides of chassis according to the weight distributions of the car. Similarly it will be installed {{on the other side}} of the car. The system operates on pneumatic drive which consists of following main parts: Pneumatic cylinder, compressed air cylinder, <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> liver to lift the vehicle. The <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> liver actuate separately for either side of car as per the condition. The car gets lifted and load gets distributed on pivot of <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> liver they guide by c-sec case. The cylinder pushes the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> liver under guide of c-section. This jack will be very useful for all the senior citizens and especially for females (ladies) who find it extremely difficult to operate the jack manually in any breakdown condition. As the hydraulic oil is incompressible so the lifting capacity is more in comparison with the pneumatic system which operates on air which is compressible...|$|R
50|$|L&MR No.32 Experiment {{was built}} in 1833 with {{vertical}} cylinders mounted just behind the chimney, driving the wheels via a <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> The locomotive also had piston valves. These valves were probably {{the reason that the}} design was not a success, rather than the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> transmission, which was used successfully in other locomotives. Another reason that the locomotive was not successful was steam leakage from the cylinders. Experiment was withdrawn after a few months.|$|R
5000|$|USS {{is usually}} {{indirect}} — the bars {{link to the}} headset through a system of rods or cables and possibly a <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> Most tadpole trikes are USS.|$|R
50|$|Experiment was a steam {{locomotive}} {{designed and built}} by Richard Roberts in 1833 for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR). The locomotive had vertical cylinders driving via <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hibernia {{was built}} in 1834 for the D&KR. It {{was one of a}} class of three similar locomotives. Like Experiment, power {{transmission}} from the vertical cylinders was via <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hibernia was a steam {{locomotive}} designed by Richard Roberts and built by Sharp, Roberts and Company in 1834 for the Dublin and Kingstown Railway (D&KR). The locomotive had vertical cylinders driving via <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Light Tank Mk III {{introduced}} a slightly modified version {{with only one}} <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> per bogie, causing the spring to lie somewhat angled as a result. This system was used on the Universal Carrier.|$|R
50|$|Speeds {{increased}} due to {{more powerful}} engines, {{and the quality}} of ride had to be improved. In the 1930s, the Christie suspension was developed, which allowed the use of coil springs inside a vehicle's armored hull, by changing the direction of force deforming the spring, using a <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> The T-34's suspension was directly descended from Christie designs. Horstmann suspension was a variation which used a combination of <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> and exterior coil springs, in use from the 1930s to the 1990s. The bogie, but nonetheless independent, suspension of the M3 Lee/Grant and the M4 Sherman was similar to the Hortsmann type, with the suspension contained within the track oval.|$|R
30|$|The <b>Bell</b> <b>Crank</b> {{system is}} the one {{with a pair of}} wheels on a <b>bell</b> <b>crank,</b> each bogie {{connected}} by a short arm and lever to a central spring running the tank length [9]. This system had too much interconnection but decent travel length and tended to make the tank sway back and forth a lot in motion. The single and double Torsion Bar system is a common modern-type tank suspension and can be found today on many fast track layers. The original structure and concept appeared on the German tiger tanks [10]. A steel bar runs under the bottom of the tank and twists with a short trailing arm connected to it and carrying a wheel. As the wheels hit bumps, the bar twists to absorb the impact. This system is compact, light, simple to manufacture and can provide decent travel length.|$|R
50|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the Type 95 tank was its simple suspension system. Two bogie wheels were suspended on a single <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> with two <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> per side. The tracks were driven through the front sprockets. There were two return wheels. The suspension had troubles early on, with a tendency to pitch so badly on rough ground that the crew sometimes {{found it impossible to}} drive at any speed, and so it was modified with a brace to connect the pairs of bogies. Despite this, the tank continued to give its users a rough ride across any uneven ground. It was provided with an interior layer of asbestos padding separated from the hull with an air gap, to isolate the crew from the sun-heated armor plates, and to protect the crew from injury when the tank moved across rough terrain.|$|R
50|$|By 1932, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was {{producing}} an air-cooled diesel engine that was suitable for tanks. It was placed experimentally into a Type 89. This later {{became known as}} the Type 89-B medium tank. Subsequently, Major Tomio Hara designed the basis of many of the suspensions of future Japanese tanks, the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> scissors which had paired bogie wheels connected by a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull.|$|R
50|$|Primary {{flight control}} is {{achieved}} by use of dual control wheels and rudder pedals. The control wheels operate the elevator and ailerons mechanically through a system of cables, pulleys, push-pull tubes and <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b> Trim functions, microphone keying, autopilot override and steering system switches {{are located in the}} control wheels. The rudder pedals mechanically operate the rudder for directional yaw control. Nose wheel steering is electrically controlled via the rudder pedals.|$|R
50|$|The Type 87 Chi-I had {{a complex}} {{parallelogram}} suspension system with {{two pairs of}} road bogie wheels per leaf spring arrangement. Hara designed a <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> scissors suspension that paired the bogie wheels and connected them to a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull. This suspension became standard on {{the majority of the}} subsequently designed Japanese tanks and can be seen on the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha, as examples.|$|R
50|$|In the June 2010 {{issue of}} Car and Driver magazine, safety {{specifications}} were revealed {{pertaining to the}} safety of the SLS AMG's gullwing doors. Ten to fifteen milliseconds after a detected rollover, explosive bolts situated {{at the top of the}} door frame fire and <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> separate the doors from the car for easy exit during a serious accident. An anti-lock braking system and a 3-stage Electronic stability program (ESP) are standard.|$|R
2500|$|The third {{requirement}} {{is for a}} linkage between the [...] "machines" [...] (engine and gun) to be synchronized. Many early gears used an intricate and inherently fragile <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> and push rod linkage that could easily jam or otherwise malfunction, especially when required to work at higher speeds {{than it had been}} designed for. There were several alternative methods, including an oscillating rod, a flexible drive, a column of hydraulic fluid, a cable, or an electrical connection.|$|R

50|$|The year 2000 car {{marked the}} return to inboard suspension. However, the {{mounting}} posts for the <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> caused cracks in the main frame tubes. This car utilized the same engine, differential, and rear chassis subframe configurations as the 1998 and 1999 cars. However, a new rear upright and half shaft designs were implemented to eliminate cv joint failure and to reduce overall weight. The remainder of the chassis was fully redesigned from the engine forward.|$|R

5000|$|The Type 2 Ke-To {{was based}} on the Type 98, using the same engine and <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> suspension. However, the gun turret was {{enlarged}} and the main armament was changed to the more powerful Type 1 37 mm gun, with a muzzle velocity of 800 m/s. The new 37 mm gun used gave the tank [...] "slightly better performance". The designation “Type 2” represented the year 1942, “Ke” represented “light”, and “To” represented the number seven.|$|R
50|$|The Type 95 So-Ki was {{an armored}} {{railroad}} {{car of the}} Imperial Japanese Army used for patrolling and guarding railway lines in both Manchuria and Burma. The chassis {{was based on the}} Type 95 Ha-Go Light Tank. The Type 95 So-Ki had light armor and no weapons armament. It had a simple suspension system with bogie wheels suspended on <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> {{on each side of the}} chassis. The tracks were driven through the front sprockets. There were three small return wheels.|$|R
50|$|The export plan never materialised and the Milemaster, {{with its}} modest specificationhand gear change and bicycle seatand lacking rear suspension, was marketed instead in the United Kingdom until 1952. In 1949, Tandon {{introduced}} the 122 cc Superglid featuring conventional foot gear-change {{and a new}} frame with swinging-arm rear suspension. However, the suspension itself was highly unusual with damper units being replaced by a <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> linked to rubber bands for suspension and a hard rubber block for compression action, all located under the gearbox.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the motion}} in the Derschmidt rotor follows the natural change in drag through the rotation, the force applied to the blades to move them into {{position}} is quite small. Of the several designs he presented in his early patents, most used a very small linkage from a <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> {{on the inner side}} of the blade attached to a small pushrod for operation. These rods were attached to a disk set eccentrically to the centre of rotation, which drove the blades into their proper locations.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically, {{the design}} shares {{much in common}} with the Christie suspension, which also uses a <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> to press on a spring. The main {{difference}} is that in the Christie each wheel is mounted separately and the spring is usually mounted on or inside the tank hull. The longer spring allows for more controlled flexion and potentially longer throw. Christie suspensions are generally more difficult to maintain because the wheels and suspension are mounted separately, and a broken spring can be difficult to reach without removing the wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Type 98, in {{comparison}} to the Type 95, featured thicker, welded armor of improved shape, including the use of a Mitsubishi Type 100 6-Cylinder air-cooled diesel engine, rated at 130 horsepower, and located sideways to make maintenance easier. Slightly lighter and shorter than the original Type 95, it could travel at 50 km/h even with its thicker armor. Three pairs of bogies with six road-wheels connected to the chassis using <b>bell</b> <b>cranks,</b> which transferred any movement in the bogies into sideways motion that was absorbed by springs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{consisted of}} three bogies per side—each formed of two <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> arranged as [...] "scissors" [...] with springs at the top. Each bogie carried two rubber-rimmed wheels. The first ten production vehicles, which {{can be considered as}} forming a separate preseries, had curved bogie sides; in later vehicles the bogies had straight sides. The bogies superficially resembled the R35 type, but used horizontal helical springs instead of rubber cylinders. The sprocket was at the front, the idler—which itself was sprung to automatically control tension—at the rear. There were two top rollers.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} is initially calibrated to the standard, and the zero {{is set to}} this value. Then, the test specimen are placed on the measuring table and are slid below the plunger of the instrument. Any difference in the measured dimension of the specimen will result in either the lowering or rising of the plunger. The lowering or rising of plunger will make the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever to move in forward or backward direction, and in turn, will twist or untwist the metallic strip.the centre line of strip is perforated {{in order to prevent}} excessive stress.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{design feature}} is that {{two or more}} wheels are mounted to a common framework. Each wheel is mounted on an L-shaped swing arm that forms a <b>bell</b> <b>crank,</b> so the upward movement of the wheel is turned into sideways motion {{of the top of}} the crank. The two arms may be mounted on a common shaft between them, or more commonly, two closely spaced shafts. The two wheels share a coil spring running horizontally between the tops of the crank arms. Thus if one wheel moves up over an obstacle, the spring is compressed against the swing arm of the other wheel.|$|R
5000|$|On May 18, Atlas 7D was {{prepared}} for a night launch of an RVX-2 reentry vehicle from LC-14, the second attempt to fly one after the launch of a C-series Atlas had miscarried two months earlier. The test was conducted with the Mercury astronauts in attendance in order to showcase the vehicle that would take them into orbit, but 64 seconds of flight ended in another explosion, prompting Gus Grissom to remark [...] "Are we really {{going to get on}} top of one of those things?". This failure was traced to improper separation of the right launcher hold-down pin, which damaged the B-2 nacelle structure and caused helium pressurization gas to escape during ascent. At 62 seconds into the launch, the pressure in the LOX tank exceeded the pressure in the RP-1 tank, which reversed the intermediate bulkhead. Two seconds later, the missile exploded. Film review confirmed that the hold-down pin on the right launcher arm failed to retract at liftoff and was jerked from the missile. The resultant force caused a four-inch gap in the B-2 nacelle structure which also damaged low pressure helium lines. The hold-down pin had not retracted due to a sheared retaining bolt in the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> pulley system in the right launcher arm. Once again, all other systems in the Atlas functioned well and there were no problems not directly attributable to the launcher malfunction. The flight of 7D resulted in improved maintenance procedures for the launcher equipment at CCAS and use of higher heat steel in the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> retaining bolts.|$|R
50|$|In 1931, {{following}} {{the sale of}} Simmonds Aircraft, Simmonds went to Paris to attend the annual Air Show at Le Bourget, which included a large fixed display of aircraft equipment suppliers. One of these was the Coursey Company which made push pull controls for use in operating aircraft control surfaces. The design of these were ingenious for their day in that you could push significant loads, as well as pull them. As Simmonds described it later, he did an instant market survey and realized this product could end the use of <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> and levers to control aircraft flight surfaces. He negotiated an exclusive license to produce and sell these devices {{in all the world}} except France.|$|R
50|$|One unique {{feature of}} the Rover 2000 was {{the design of the}} front {{suspension}} system, in which a <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> (an L-shaped rotating bracket trailing the upper hub carrier joint) conveyed the vertical motion of the wheel to a fore-and-aft-horizontally mounted spring fastened to the rear wall of the engine compartment. A single hydraulically damped arm was mounted on the firewall for the steering.The front suspension was designed to allow as much width for the engine compartment as possible so that Rover's Gas Turbine engine could be fitted. In the event, the engine was never used for the production vehicle, but the engine compartment width facilitated the accommodation of the V8 engine adopted years after the P6's initial launch.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1920s he devised a better {{solution}}. The solution was {{the addition of}} a bellcrank, which changed the direction of motion from vertical to horizontal. The road wheels were individually mounted on a pipe that could move vertically only, at the top of which the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> rotated the direction of motion to the rear. Springs were mounted {{on the end of the}} crank, and could be as long as needed, lying along the inside of the hull. The result was a substantial increase in range of motion, from only some 10 cm in his original designs, to 25 cm on the M1928, 35 cm on the M1930, and 60 cm on the M1932.|$|R
25|$|A major problem, afflicting early {{production}} Typhoons in particular, was {{a series}} of structural failures leading to loss of the entire tail sections of some aircraft, mainly during high-speed dives. Eventually a combination of factors was identified, including harmonic vibration, which could quickly lead to metal fatigue, and a weak transport joint just forward of the horizontal tail unit. The loss of the tailplane of R7692 (having only 11 hours of flight recorded) on 11 August 1942, {{in the hands of an}} experienced test pilot (Seth-Smith), caused a major reassessment which concluded that the failure of the bracket holding the elevator mass balance <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> linkage had allowed unrestrained flutter which led to structural failure of the fuselage at the transport joint.|$|R
