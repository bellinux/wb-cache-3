40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis has aimed to further investigate magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry (MRT) techniques as to become a reliable guidance tool for thermal therapy. The various physical processes allowing for temperature measurements based upon the MR signal are described. It is demonstrated that proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) -based MRT, which employs the temperature dependence of the proton electron screening constant of water, is the method of choice. Potential sources of error in PRFS-based MRT are identified, in particular time varying magnetic field inhomogeneities and heat-induced changes of the magnetic susceptibility of tissue. A source of time varying magnetic field inhomogeneities in vivo is respiration. A {{study was conducted to}} quantify respiration-induced field inhomogeneities in the human breast, to assess its impact on PRFS-based MRT. The average field fluctuation due to regular respiration was 0. 13 ppm and due to maximum capacity respiration 0. 16 ppm. These numbers can be misinterpreted as temperature changes of 13 ºC and 16 ºC, respectively, when PRFS based MR thermometry is used during thermal treatment of breast cancer. In conclusion, respiration causes significant field fluctuations in the breast that should be corrected for to allow accurate MR thermometry in the human breast under free breathing circumstances. Furthermore, the influence of the temperature dependence of the susceptibility of tissue on PRFS-based MRT during thermal therapy was studied. Heating experiments were performed in a controlled phantom set-up to show the impact of temperature-induced susceptibility changes on PRFS-based temperature maps. To study the implications for a clinical patient, simulations were performed in a 3 D breast model for the specific clinical case of MR-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) in the breast. The simulations showed that an ellipsoidal HIFU thermal spot of diameter 8 mm and length 20 mm and a maximum temperature increase of ΔT = 30 ºC led to temperature errors in the glandular tissue ranging between - 8. 6 ºC and + 6. 2 ºC, depending on the orientation of the focal spot. It was concluded that the influence of susceptibility changes may lead to significant temperature errors in PRFS-based MRT that are not to be neglected. Rather, a more thorough understanding of the relation between temperature and magnetic susceptibility was found to be required. Especially the temperature dependence of the susceptibility of fat tissue is of interest, since it is reported {{to be in the same}} order of magnitude as the temperature dependence of the proton electron screening constant of water. However, no values have been reported in literature on the temperature dependence of the susceptibility of human fat tissue. Therefore, a study was conducted in which this temperature dependence was measured for human breast fat tissue. In this work ex vivo measurements were performed on a 14. 1 T five millimeter narrow bore NMR spectrometer. Breast fat tissue samples were collected from six subjects, directly post-mortem. The susceptibility was measured over a temperature range from 24 ºC to 65 ºC. A linear behaviour of the susceptibility over temperature was observed in all six samples. The resulting temperature dependence of the susceptibility of human breast fat ranged between 0. 0038 and 0. 0076 ppm/ºC. The outcome of this study supports the previous findings that the impact of heat-induced susceptibility changes of fat during thermal therapy in the breast may not be neglected. There is an additional issue regarding tissues containing fat. The electron screening constant of protons in fat is near independent of temperature which hampers PRFS-based temperature mapping in fatty tissues. However, the presence of fat may be used to our benefit by using it as a temperature independent reference signal which allows for absolute rather than relative MR temperature measurements. Multiple resonances can be separately detected in spectroscopic data. An image-based MR technique which allows for the acquisition of spectroscopic data at high temporal and spatial resolution is the multi gradient-echo (mGE) sequence. The application of the mGE sequence for MR thermometry purposes was further developed. The possibility of post-processing the mGE data into absolute temperature maps using time domain analysis of the magnitude of the mGE signals was investigated. In vitro experiments were performed to provide proof of concept for retrieving absolute temperature maps from the time domain analysis of mGE magnitude images. It is shown that this technique is insensitive to both field drift and local field disturbances. Furthermore, ex vivo bone marrow experiments were performed, using the fat resonance as a reference for absolute temperature mapping. It was shown that the post-processing based on the magnitude signal in the time domain allows for the determination of the resonance frequency difference between water and fat in bone marrow. However, it was concluded that the relation between this frequency difference and absolute temperature has to be examined more extensively because temperature dependent electron screening might not be the only factor influencing the frequency difference between water and fat in tissue. The post-processing of the MR signal to obtain temperature maps is based on certain assumptions with regard to the acquired signal. Specific situation exists in which the assumed properties of the acquired signal are incorrect. MR thermometry techniques that are based on the temperature dependence of the water proton resonance frequency are generally considered to be insensitive to static field inhomogeneities, because they either employ subtraction of successive phase images (PRFS-based MRT) or use an internal temperature-independent reference component (mGE-based MRT). It is shown that MR thermometry measurements are most certainly affected by the presence of static background field gradients, and in particular by background gradients that are aligned with the read-out gradient. Both theoretically and in phantom experiments it was shown that static background field gradients alter the effective echo time in gradient-echo acquisitions, which induces temperature errors in PRFS-based and mGE-based MR thermometry. The impact of static background gradients on MRT in vivo was assessed by static field gradient mapping in the breast of a volunteer. It was concluded that accurate field gradient mapping would facilitate better choices with regard to the direction and strength of the read-out gradient employed, to avoid errors due to background gradients in vivo. Finally, it is hypothesized that polyethylene glycol signals from pegylated liposomes may provide a temperature insensitive proton <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>component</b> than can serve as a reference for absolute MR temperature measurements. The feasibility of performing dynamic absolute MR thermometry using a multi-gradient echo sequence in combination with pegylated liposomes is evaluated. It was shown by a dilution experiment that at clinical relevant concentrations, the liposomal formulation and MR imaging parameters used in this study do not allow for precise absolute mGE-based MR temperature measurements with the PEG resonance as reference, due to insufficient signal-to-noise ratio. For translation to in vivo applications of this PEG-referenced MR thermometry technique, increased signal from the PEG resonance is thus required, which may be achieved by active targeting or by chemical adjustments to increase the PEG-load per liposom...|$|E

In {{order to}} study the common {{nonlinear}} characteristics of the vibration isolator, a single degree of freedom system with cubic restoring force is introduced to describe the nonlinear vibration isolation system in the paper and the harmonic balance method was applied to investigate the primary resonance near the natural frequency of the system.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The power plant and aerospace industries have been facing a huge loss, due to structural failure. The structural failure occurs due {{to the presence of}} the crack in it. Hence, it becomes necessary to monitor the structural health under operating condition. Most of the techniques, for structural health monitoring are used for a specific purpose. Some of these techniques require structure dismantling, which is very much expensive and time consuming. So the vibration based structural health monitoring is advantageous, compared to other techniques. Most of the vibration based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) approaches, use linear vibration theory. But, these linear vibration based procedures, have inherently low sensitivity to crack. Since crack introduces nonlinearities in the system, their merits in damage detection need to be investigated for SHM. In this thesis, the problem is focused on studying nonlinear dynamics of cracked structures for Structural Health Monitoring. For this, simulations and experiments are performed. The new procedure for the simulation is developed using Matlab-Simulink. It uses the numerical approximation for dynamic compliance operators and a nonlinear model of cracks contact faces interaction to study the dynamic behaviour of the cracked bar. Furthermore, the finite element model of the cracked cantilever bar with crack- tip plasticity is developed and the dynamic behaviour of the elasto-plastic bar is studied. Additionally, numerous experiments are performed to study the dynamics of cantilever bar with the fatigue crack in it. The results from Matlab-Simulink simulation shows the distribution of higher harmonics generated along the bar length, as a function of distance from the crack. In finite element simulation, comparison is made between the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> of cracked cantilever bar with and without crack-tip plasticity. It is found that, there is decrease in <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> of the cracked bar with cracked tip plasticity, when compared with the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> of cracked bar without crack-tip plasticity. This reduction in <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> is due to the crack-induced plasticity near the crack tip which affects the overall stiffness of bar. In experiments, the response is measured at four different points on the cracked cantilever bar at a given resonant frequency of excitation at lower and higher vibration amplitude. For lower vibration amplitude, it is found that the response obtained near the vicinity of the crack shows the presence of higher harmonics of resonant frequency, which disappears in the response obtained far away from the crack. For higher vibration amplitude, it is found that the response obtained near the vicinity of the crack shows the presence of higher harmonics along with the low <b>frequency</b> <b>component.</b> This low <b>frequency</b> <b>component</b> causes modulation, which leads to the generation of side band frequencies near the resonant frequency. The occurrence of low <b>frequency</b> <b>component</b> and side band frequencies is due to the vibro-impact behaviour of crack. The amplitude of these side band frequencies and higher harmonics are reduced in the response obtained far away from the crack. This indicates that crack-induced nonlinearity has a localized effect on the dynamics of bar.

40|$|Process Compensated Resonance Testing (PCRT) is a {{nondestructive}} evaluation method that measures and analyzes the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> of a <b>component</b> for material state characterization, defect detection and process monitoring. PCRT inspections of {{gas turbine engine}} components have demonstrated the sensitivity of <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> to manufacturing defects and in-service thermal and mechanical damage. Prior work on PCRT modeling has developed forward modeling and model inversion techniques that simulate the effects of geometry variation, material property variation, and damage on Mar-M- 247 nickel-based superalloy samples. Finite element method (FEM) forward model simulations predicted the effects of variation in geometry, material properties and damage on <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Model inversion used measured <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> to characterize the material state of components. Parallel work developed a process for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in PCRT models and measurements. The UQ process evaluated the propagation of uncertainty from various sources, identified the most significant uncertainty sources, and enabled uncertainty mitigation to improve model and measurement accuracy. Current efforts have expanded on those developments in several areas. One-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) forward model simulations were conducted on cylindrical dog bone coupons made from Mar-M- 247. The simulations predicted the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> response to variation in geometry, elastic properties, crystallographic orientation, creep strain and cracking. The OFAT studies were followed by forward model Monte Carlo simulations that predicted the effects of multiple, concurrent sources of variation and damage on <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies,</b> allowing characterization of virtual populations and quantification of uncertainty propagation. The Monte Carlo simulation design points were used to demonstrate the generation of a virtual database of components for training PCRT inspection applications, or “sorting modules. ” Virtual database training sets can potentially overcome the limitations imposed by the availability of components and material states for training sets based on physical examples. Forward modeling tools and techniques were applied to titanium to simulate the effects of material variation, damage, and crystallographic texture. Forward modeling was also applied to more complex geometries, including a notional turbine blade, to demonstrate the application of modeling tools to shapes representative of gas turbine engine components. Model inversion tools and techniques have also advanced under the current effort. Prior inversion methods relied on iterative fitting to polynomial expressions for simple geometries and bulk material properties. Current efforts have demonstrated FEM-based model inversion which allows characterization of complex shapes and material states. FEM-based design spaces were generated, model inversion was carried out for surrogate modeled resonance spectra, and inversion performance was evaluated.

40|$|In this master thesis the {{vertical}} wave loads and vertical {{responses of the}} floating collar of a circular fish farm have been investigated. The response has been investigated for a collar without the presence of mooring system and net cage. First, a linear model was used to calculate displacements, relative motion between the floater and the surface and bending stresses. The linear displacements and bending stresses in regular long crested waves were compared with a nonlinear model for the excitation forces. The nonlinear excitation forces were obtained by integrating the hydrostatic and dynamic pressures over the exact wetted surface of the floater. Two different configurations of the floating collar were investigated; a floater with only one plastic ring and a floater with two concentric rings. The radius and the displaced mass of the two configurations were equal. The response was calculated by mode superposition. The added mass is mode dependent, and thus a modal formulation of the added mass was used. The modal <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> for one ring were higher than the modal <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> for two rings. The three first <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> for two rings, corresponding to heave, pitch and the first elastic mode, are 2. 25 rad/s, 2. 69 rad/s and 2. 91 rad/s. The relative motion for low wave frequencies is higher for one ring than for two rings. The bending stresses are significantly higher for two rings between a wave frequency of 1. 5 rad/s and 2. 9 rad/s. The linear model was used to calculate standard deviations for bending stresses in irregular waves. For low spectral peak periods the JONSWAP spectrum gave larger {{standard deviations for the}} bending stresses than the ISSC spectrum. For peak periods larger than 4. 5 s the ISSC spectrum gave the largest standard deviations. For regular waves the linear and nonlinear model gave similar results for modal displacements and maximum bending stresses in the floater for small wave frequencies. At the modal <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> the nonlinear modal forces for the modes at resonance were significantly lower than the linear forces. This resulted in a reduced nonlinear response compared with linear theory at resonance.

40|$|A fluid density sensor {{based on}} <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> change of a {{metallic}} tube is presented. The sensor {{has been developed}} without using a complex micro-fabrication process. The sensor is able to identify fluid types/contaminations and improve the performance by reducing testing time, decreasing complexity of testing equipment and reducing sample sizes. The sensor can measure the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> of its own structure and determine the change in <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> due to the subsequent sample inside the tube. Numerical modelling, analytical modelling and physical {{testing of a prototype}} sensor showed comparable results for both the magnitude and <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> shift. The modelling results yielded a <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> shift of 200 Hz from 9. 87 kHz to 9. 67 kHz after the water was filled into the tube. The actual testing illustrated a <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> change of 280 Hz from 9. 11 kHz to 8. 83 kHz. The ultimate aim of the work is to determine <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> of desired samples at a level that could detect genetic disease on a cellular level.

The <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> of bars fixed to a post tightly or loosely must be respectively compared. If {{the change in the}} <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> is small, no significant care will be needed. If the change in the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> is considerable, measuring with a bar fixed to a post tightly should be performed because the bars are fixed tightly to the post when inspecting wooden guardrails.|$|R

For these experiments the Brandaris 128 fast framing camera was operated in a special segmented mode. The <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> found for SonoVue ™ microbubbles are in good agreement with the modified Herring model for coated bubbles indicating that the shell is only slightly affecting the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> of this class of contrast bubbles. contrast agents, <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency,</b> high-speed imaging I...|$|R

We derive closed-form solutions to the relaxation oscillation (<b>resonance)</b> <b>frequency</b> and damping term, as well as the low-frequency damping term, and discuss design rules for maximizing <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> and broadband performance. A phasor model is described in order to better explain the enhancement of the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency.</b> Experimental curves match closely to theory.

40|$|A {{piezoelectric}} {{vibration feeder}} with a magnetic spring {{is discussed in}} this paper. The feeder can keep <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> relatively stable under changing loading. Through the analysis on the working principle and magnetic spring stiffness characteristic of this feeder, the dynamic model was established and the relationship among system <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency,</b> loading and magnetic spring stiffness was obtained. The analysis showed that, as the loading changed, the magnetic spring stiffness changed accordingly, which maintained a trend of stability in the system <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency.</b> A prototype was made for the experiment, and the relationship among the loading, magnetic spring axial clearance and system <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> was obtained. The result showed that, when the loading changes, the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> and feeding speed tended to be stable, which matched the theoretical analysis. Through comparison with a traditional vibration feeder, within nominal loading, this new feeder has more stable <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> and feeding speed...|$|R
