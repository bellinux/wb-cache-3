50|$|It {{consists}} of inserting a thread through a layered dry fabric, using a needle that, after insertion, moves {{back along the}} same trajectory leaving a loop of the thread {{on the bottom of}} the structure. It is a technology developed for and used within the thermoset <b>resin</b> <b>injection</b> manufacturing route, however it is currently being debated whether also pre-pregs can be successfully tufted. Tufting is considered a more economical and flexible method compared to 3D weaving or 3D braiding to include z-fibres in laminated composites. It resembles stitching, but it is different in that tufting only requires access from one side of the preform. Depending on the equipment used, all shapes and forms may potentially be reinforced by tufting. The density of z-fibres inserted can vary according to the expected loading pattern. On the other hand, the increase of z-properties in the dry preform is comparably low because tufting comprises no force-fit. Consequently, before consolidation, tufted preforms are not easier to handle than unreinforced ones. In fact the loops can represent an added complexity for the resin infusion process as they can complicate the consolidation of the structure.|$|E

40|$|Settlements of {{building}} foundations are generally due to movements {{of water in}} the shallow subsurface, both by natural and man-made causes. Although <b>resins</b> <b>injection</b> has been revealed to be a satisfactory solution for ground consolidation, a continuous monitoring of the process is needed to achieve optimal results. In order to control the <b>injection</b> of expanding <b>resins,</b> a field procedure has been developed, based on the use of time-lapse three dimensional (4 D) Electrical Resistivity Tomography. The choice of electrical resistivity, as a parameter for designing and monitoring the consolidation work, is based on the key assumption that this physical property is the most sensitive to water content changes in soils. During the injection stage, repeated ERT acquisitions allow the injection process to be controlled and the injection schedule and its parameters to be modified, whenever necessary. In this paper the procedure and its results are illustrated, through a case history in Venice (Italy), where salt water bearing soils also had to be taken into account. Careful analysis of electrode array configurations and parameters had therefore to be performed in advance. Horizontal and vertical sections from the resulting 3 D resistivity models show, through a noticeable local increase of the resistivity at and nearby the injection points, that re-homogenisation of soil was successfully achieved. Repeated 3 D ERT measurements, carried out three years and a half after the consolidation work, showed that stabilisation of the subsoil below and around settled foundations was achieved, as was also confirmed by comparing suitable extensimeter measurements on overlying structures, carried out before and after the treatment...|$|R
40|$|Polymer matrix composites, {{especially}} those with carbon fiber reinforcement, are becoming increasingly common in aerospace applications due to their high stiffness to weight ratio, resulting in significant weight and fuel savings on commercial and military aircraft. Despite their excellent properties, carbon fiber composites are often susceptible to damage {{in the form of}} delaminations or interlaminar cracking caused by low energy impact or manufacturing defects. Often not easily detectable, delaminations are detrimental to the strength of the composite and can ultimately result in failure of the component. Therefore methods must be developed to repair damaged composites. Injection repair is a procedure that involves injecting a low viscosity resin into the damaged area and subjecting the composite to heat to cure the <b>resin.</b> Currently, <b>injection</b> repairs are rarely used in high temperature applications {{because of the lack of}} resins with both low viscosity and high thermal stability. Therefore demonstrating the use of a resin with satisfactory viscosity and Tg requirements would expand the application of injection repairs to more vigorous environments. In the present study, the injection repair method was developed to repair damaged bismaleimide carbon fiber composites that are similar to composites used on several high temperature weapon platforms. Bisphenol E cyanate ester (BECy) was chosen as the <b>injection</b> <b>resin</b> due to having the unique combination of low viscosity and a high glass transition temperature. Cure kinetic studies found an optimum undercure schedule to achieve the maximum Tg while avoiding the high temperature postcure. Mechanical and adhesive tests revealed that partially cured BECy had properties superior to that of the fully cured resin. Following the evaluation of the <b>resin,</b> the <b>injection</b> repair procedure and set up were developed. Successful and reproducible repairs were performed on panels pre-damaged through static loading and drop tower impact, as well as on panels of various thicknesses. Ultrasonic C-scans and flash thermography showed successful resin infiltration, and repair efficiencies were calculated by quantifying the stiffness of the pristine, delaminated and repair panels. Higher repair efficiencies were achieved for the static loading method over the drop tower method, as well as for thinner panels over thicker panels...|$|R
40|$|Instability {{phenomena}} {{in the urban}} environment and their consequences on infrastructures are a very topical issue in engineering practice. There {{are a lot of}} technical solutions on the market and, among these, consolidation techniques have assumed a role of primary importance. Due to the effectiveness of the intervention, the reduced invasiveness and especially the implementation and integration of monitoring techniques like the geophysical method of time-lapse 3 D electrical resistivity tomography and geotechnical tests like dynamic penetration tests (Morelli et al., 2006, Santarato et al., 2011), the <b>injections</b> of expanding <b>resins</b> {{are one of the most}} established among consolidation methods. This work tries to deepen knowledge about physical and mechanical changes in the subsoil after consolidation with expanding resins. The research is divided into two main branches: experimental tests on a controlled test site and continuous data analysis on a wide archive of data, kindly provided by a specialized company operating in the market. Geological, geotechnical and geophysical test have been carried out in the test site in order to obtain a detailed picture of the physical and mechanical properties of the undisturbed state. In particular CPT tests, geotechnical laboratory testing, 2 D and 3 D electrical resistivity tomography, MASW were carried out. The experimental tests were carried out in three main phases. In the first one the effects induced by injections on the mechanical properties of the involved materials have been studied. In the second one the effects induced on the electrical properties and in the last one the possible relationship between the physical and mechanical properties measured after the injections have been studied. From the mechanical point of view, obtained results shows remarkable increases in load-bearing capacity of subsoils, in the ability to fill voids and the consequent migration of the interstitial water. The results also show the effectiveness of the 3 D electrical resistivity tomography in the three-dimensional and temporal evolution monitoring of the phenomena taking place in the subsoil during the injections, as well as a good relationship between electrical and mechanical properties after the consolidation. Before the analysis of case histories a rigorous and careful data sorting work aims to generate datasets as homogeneous as possible. The data is classified by buildings properties (number of floors, presence of basements, topographical variations, etc [...] ), soil properties (detected in situ by the geologist), presence of groundwater, etc [...] Both 3 D electrical resistivity tomography and dynamic penetration tests are performed before and after the injections. Electrical resistivity and dynamic cone resistance percentage change is then calculated. The obtained results show that there is a high percentage of cases in which the curve of the percentage change of the electrical resistivity is similar to the curve of the dynamic cone resistance percentage change. This work aims to improve our understanding on the effects induced in the subsoil by the expanding <b>resins</b> <b>injections.</b> The research has led to better understand, in quantitative terms, physical and mechanical changes that occur as a result of expanding <b>resins</b> <b>injections</b> and to increase knowledge about the response of the 3 D ERT applied to the monitoring of the consolidation process.

Settlement of buildings has several causes, which are generally triggered by movement of fluids in the subsurface. The goal of the <b>injection</b> of expanding <b>resins</b> is to occupy voids and displace water so that the continuity and stiffness of terrains around and below the settled foundation are re-established. In order to control {{the effectiveness of the}} consolidation beneath the building, non-invasive geophysical methods such as Seismics, ERT or GPR can be used. Among these, ultimate 3 D ERT developments provide the best solution for this application because of the fast imaging capability, the extreme reliability and repeatability of the measurements and the high correlation of electrical resistivity to soil moisture, which is known to be {{the most common cause of}} settlement. Given the often limited accessibility of work sites, a successful practical approach was focused on innovative arrangements of surface electrodes (inside and outside of buildings) and acquisition geometries, combined with appropriate measurements and processing procedures, that enable the effective 3 D imaging of the foundation soils, before, during and after the injection treatment. Details on the field procedures, validated by a sensitivity and resolution analysis, are introduced through the description of a case-history in which the pre-injection ERT measurements, combined with structural and geotechnical evidences, allow to investigate the status of foundations and lithological eterogeneities. Time-lapse ERT surveys control soil homogenization and fluid movements and provide a quasi real-time feedback for modifying and modulating the parameters of treatment, which would be very difficult with direct methods.
