40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of some operating conditions on the simultaneous removal of NOx and SO 2 from simulated NO–SO 2 –air flue-gas mixtures in a scrubber column. The gaseous components were absorbed into 6 M HNO 3 electrolyte in the scrubber in a counter-current mode, and were oxidatively removed by the Ag(II) mediator oxidant electrochemically generated in an electrochemical cell set-up. The integration of the electrochemical cell with the scrubber set-up ensured continuous regeneration of the Ag(II) mediator and its repeated reuse for NOx and SO 2 removal purpose, thereby avoiding: (1) the usage of chemicals continuously for oxidation and (2) the production of secondary waste. The influences of packing material (<b>raschig</b> glass <b>rings,</b> <b>raschig</b> poly(vinylidene) fluoride <b>rings,</b> Jaeger tri-pack perfluoroalkoxy spheres), feed concentrations of NO and SO 2 (100 – 400 ppm NO and 100 – 400 ppm SO 2), superficial gas velocity (0. 061 – 0. 61 m s� 1) and liquid velocity (0. 012 – 0. 048 m s� 1) were investigated.
