500|$|This {{underground}} station {{looks like a}} typical express station, with four tracks and two island platforms. To the east (railroad north) is a large storage and <b>relay</b> <b>yard</b> consisting of two levels with four relay tracks each, extending approximately [...] to around 184th Place. This total of eight storage tracks gives 179th Street the highest peak terminal capacity of any station in the New York City Subway: 63 trains per hour, or one train every 57 seconds, although the station currently operates at a far lower throughput (only 17–18 trains per hour during peak hours). Terminating trains enter {{on one of the}} two northbound tracks, then relay to one of the two levelsthe upper level if coming from the express track, or the lower level if coming from the local track. They then return on the corresponding track on the southbound side. Due to the switching configuration at the station, the few E trains that begin here always leave from the express track and run express along Hillside Avenue. F trains may leave from either track, switching to the local track east of 169th Street if necessary. Outside of relay operations, the yard provides storage for four trains. It is estimated that the relay tracks east of the station can fit about 600 passenger automobiles.|$|E

On June 18, 1873, Roswell Pettibone Flower became president of {{the railroad}}. Even through the depression the railroad was kept into good shape and investments were being made. The railroad remained a very modern one. Plans for further extensions were put aside, and focus was on improving the lines already present. 56 Pound steel was replacing iron rails. The best iron rails were being used to <b>relay</b> <b>yards</b> and sidings. Also the branches were improved with the old iron rails. In 1879 all passenger cars were equipped with air brakes.|$|R
