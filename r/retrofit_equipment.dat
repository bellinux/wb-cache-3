5000|$|To provide cleaner {{energy to}} its customers, FirstEnergy took several {{important}} steps in 2009. First, {{the company announced}} plans in April to repower units 4 and 5 at its R.E. Burger Plant in Shadyside, Ohio, to generate electricity principally with biomass, the only base load renewable source that can displace coal emissions. [...] Furthermore, FirstEnergy is hosting a 1MWe pilot plant test of carbon capture <b>retrofit</b> <b>equipment</b> {{on one of the}} remaining coal units at the R.E. Burger Plant. [...] In September, FirstEnergy decided to complete construction on the Fremont Energy Center, a 707-MW natural-gas-fired peaking plant by the end of 2010. And finally in November, FirstEnergy purchased the rights to develop a compressed-air electric generating plant in Norton, Ohio, which Ohio Governor Ted Strickland praised as [...] "an example of how we can leverage technology and our natural resources to grow our economy and ensure our energy future." [...] The Norton project, part of the company’s overall climate change strategy, {{has the potential to be}} expanded to up to 2,700 MW of capacity—the largest in the world by far. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, [...] "a compressed-air energy storage project of this size...could be a key component in integrating large-scale intermittent renewables (such as wind) onto the nation's grid system." [...] Together, these projects, when completed, will further reduce the utility’s emissions of , which already is about one-third below the regional average.|$|E

40|$|The {{alternative}} fuels considered are {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), and methanol; vehicles were required to operate in a hybrid or dual-fuel gasoline/alternative fuel mode. Economic feasibility was determined by comparing the costs of continued use of gasoline fuel {{with the use of}} alternative fuel and <b>retrofitted</b> <b>equipment.</b> Differences in the amounts of future expenditures are adjusted by means of a total life-cycle costing. All fuels studied are technically feasible to allow a retrofit conversion to hybrid gasoline/alternative fuel operation except for methanol. Conversion to LPG is not recommended for vehicles with more than 100, 000 km (60, 000 miles) of prior use.

Energy audit will help to understand more about the ways energy and fuel are used and help in identifying the areas where waste can occur and where scope for improvement exists and to retrofit for energy conservation equipment etc. Energy audit can be classified into two types namely preliminary audit and detailed audit.

40|$|State of Hawaii generates about 90 {{percent of}} its {{electricity}} from imported fossil fuel sources. Thus, there is pressure from both public and policy makers to reduce the State dependency on foreign fossil fuel sources. To this extend, there are incentives created at State and Federal level for both residential and commercial buildings to install photovoltaic (PV) systems. Although such incentives are necessary for long-term objectives, it is shown {{in this study that}} retrofitting inefficient old building-equipment is another viable source to reduce the State of Hawaii's electricity demand. Four case studies are presented to illustrate that building-equipment retrofitting is a viable and necessary tool for increasing the energy efficiency of buildings. Each case study presents an <b>equipment</b> <b>retrofit</b> project electricity savings with its payback periods, and compares with equivalent electricity capacity and economics PV systems in Honolulu, Hawaii. The case studies show that energy savings from retrofit projects ranged from 28 % to 61 % for individual <b>equipment</b> <b>retrofits.</b> These results indicate that equipment retrofitting with energy-efficient alternatives is about 50 % or more cost-effective than installing PV systems.

40|$|In 1985, Power Efficiency Corporation of Las Vegas {{licensed}} NASA {{voltage controller}} technology from Marshall Space Flight Center. In the following years, Power Efficiency made patented {{improvements to the}} technology and marketed the resulting products throughout the world as the Performance Controller and the Power Efficiency energy-saving soft start. Soft start gradually introduces power to an electric motor, thus eliminating the harsh, violent mechanical stresses of having the device go from a dormant state to one of full activity; prevents it from running too hot; and increases the motor's lifetime. The product can pay for itself through the reduction in electricity consumed (according to Power Efficiency, within 3 years), depending on the duty cycle of the motor and the prevailing power rates. In many instances, the purchaser is eligible for special utility rebates for the environmental protection it provides. Common applications of Power Efficiency's soft start include mixers, grinders, granulators, conveyors, crushers, stamping presses, injection molders, elevators with MG sets, and escalators.

As of the date of this paper, more than 231 tangentially-fired units representing in excess of 71, 500 MWe of domestic pulverized coal fired capacity have been retrofit with ALSTOM low NOx technology. Best of class emissions range from 0. 18 lb/MMBtu for bituminous coals to less than 0. 10 lb/MMBtu for subbituminous coals, with typical levels at 0. 24 lb/MMBtu and 0. 13 lb/MMBtu, respectively.
