An attempt was made to discover some of the major characteristics and the volume of activity in each class. The results reflect the information services supplied by a single library with its own unique clientele and functions, rather than provide a means of generalizing about information services in all libraries, although they may give us some useful insights.

In September 2015, the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas announced that onchocerciasis only remained in a remote region on the border of Brazil and Venezuela.

Guatemala has submitted a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>verification.</b> The key factor in elimination is mass administration of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin. The initial projection was that the disease would be eliminated from remaining foci in the Americas by 2012.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} {{instances}} that have cast some doubt regarding {{the availability of}} British consular protection for BN(O)s outside the UK and the PRC. In 1999, {{it was reported that}} a Hong Kong resident, who had travelled to India on his BN(O) passport had been wrongly detained for 23 days because his BN(O) passport was suspected by Indian officials to be fake and was certified as a forgery by the British High Commission in Bombay without seeking verification from the relevant authorities (British Consulate-General) in Hong Kong. However, he sought assistance from the PRC Embassy there and the BN(O) passport was verified by the British Consulate-General Hong Kong under pressure of the PRC Government. It was found that his BN(O) passport was genuine.http://www.fmcoprc.gov.hk/chn/xwfb/gsxwg/2000/t40883.htmhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070620094633/http://past.people.com.cn/GB/other4583/5071/10514/20030606/1010223.html (http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr00-01/english/counmtg/hansard/001025fe.pdf pp. 22-25)Pursuant to this issue, the British authorities have upgraded all British passports regardless of type to include enhanced security features such as digitised photographs and signatures, and electronic security features that have made <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>verification</b> by foreign immigration officers by the British Consulate-General in Hong Kong far less necessary/frequent.|$|R

To examine the impact of out-migration on Kenya’s nursing workforce. Study Setting. This study analyzed de-identified nursing data from the Kenya Health Workforce Informatics System, collected by the Nursing Council of Kenya and the Department of Nursing in the Ministry of Medical Services. Study Design. We analyzed trends in Kenya’s nursing workforce from 1999 - 2007, including supply, deployment and intent to out-migrate, measured by <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>verification</b> of credentials from destination countries. Principle Findings. From 1999 - 2007, six percent of Kenya’s nursing workforce of 41, 367 nurses applied to out-migrate. Eighty-five percent of applicants were registered or BScN prepared nurses, 49 % applied within 10 years of their initial registration as a nurse, and 82 % of first-time applications were for the U. S. or U. K. For every four nurses that Kenya adds to its nursing workforce through training, one nurse from the workforce applies to out-migrate, potentially reducing by 25 % Kenya’s ability to maintain its nursing workforce through training...|$|R

30|$|This attack {{may be used}} to obfuscate the {{deployment}} of a PDP (Proof of Data Possession) protocol. Recall that PDPs are mechanisms to face malicious proxies. In caching data attack, CSP stores most of the data at a remote location while storing in its local cache data needed by location verification process. When a data access <b>request</b> is <b>for</b> location <b>verification,</b> CSP fetches data in its local cache, otherwise the request is forwarded to the remote node of data storage before sending a response to user. This attack is feasible only under the assumption that the CSP is able learn which parts of the data are used in the verification process in order to cache them and which parts are used by the conventional applications of the user in order to store them in another location. Notice that the data caching attack is different from the “With interaction” attack of a malicious proxy. In the latter, data used in the location verification are not relevant to the user so the proxy generates any data to answer the request, while in the caching attack data are used both by location verification process and by conventional user’s applications.|$|R
