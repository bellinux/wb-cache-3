5|$|Wipeout 64 also {{introduced}} split-screen multiplayer {{for the first}} time, {{as well as a}} new addition named 'Challenge Mode'.

5|$|Despite not testing {{positive}} during the <b>race</b> <b>or</b> season, the Gewiss-Ballan team {{has since been}} speculated to have executed a systematic doping program that utilized EPO throughout the 1994 season.

5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their <b>race</b> <b>or</b> sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited voir dire.|$|E
5|$|John Baldwin was {{a person}} whose views seemed {{to run counter to}} the {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although he was not an abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to <b>race</b> <b>or</b> gender. His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E
5|$|Mushers {{must start}} the race with at most {{fourteen}} dogs and finish with {{no fewer than}} six.

Participating dogs may not receive injections during the <b>race</b> <b>or</b> be {{under the influence of}} performance-enhancing substances such as steroids.

5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, <b>race,</b> <b>or</b> class, even when they are not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E
5|$|While Criterion {{had their}} own audio team to create {{original}} music, working with EA gave {{them the opportunity to}} include licensed music in Burnout 3.

Options were added to modify which songs during a <b>race</b> <b>or</b> on the menu screen and the Xbox version supports custom soundtracks.|$|E

5|$|Widespread {{segregation}} in 19th- and early 20th-century North America {{made it difficult}} for African-Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions– and impossible for inter-jurisdiction recognition between the parallel U.S. Masonic authorities. By the 1980s, such discrimination was a thing of the past, and today most U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition. The United Grand Lodge of England has no problem with recognising Prince Hall Grand Lodges. While celebrating their heritage as lodges of black Americans, Prince Hall is open to all men regardless of <b>race</b> <b>or</b> religion.|$|E
5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} <b>race</b> <b>or</b> national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} wishes {{to take over}} a {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate dialogue with the local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may invite them to a sporting event, such as elephant <b>race</b> <b>or</b> a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's popularity is not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival in an attempt to impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully launching an attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories are united, or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E

5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} speech on 28 February 2008, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng {{said that the}} Government had adjusted its policies in relation to various types of expression. For instance, in 2000 it had created Speakers' Corner as an outdoor venue for political speeches. Use of this venue was liberalized in 2004 to include performances and exhibitions. All public talks held indoors involving organizers and speakers who are Singapore citizens are also exempted from the licensing requirements of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act. However, {{freedom of speech and}} expression, though characteristic and imperative in a self-professed democracy, is not unfettered. The Government thus continues to require licences for events where the speeches relate to <b>race</b> <b>or</b> religion, and does not permit outdoor demonstrations to be held.|$|E
5|$|Much of Raël's {{advocacy}} concerning futuristic {{technology is}} described in his 2001 book, Yes to Human Cloning. He supported human genetic engineering {{in order to avoid}} genetically inherited diseases and to reduce the economic burden on society. He said that no distinctive emphasis needed to be allocated to a particular <b>race</b> <b>or</b> religion. Elsewhere in the book, he stated that nanotechnology will make it possible to have micro-distributive power generation (essentially a power plant in each house), fur-like furnishings that are self-cleaning with hair-like fibers that move on their own, and biological robots. Nanostructures control biology, so Raël expected that meat and salads will someday be grown in a machine via molecular construction.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart is a kart racing game {{featuring}} several {{single and}} multiplayer modes. During the game, players {{take control of}} one of eight Mario franchise characters and drive karts around tracks with a Mario franchise theme. In {{order for them to}} begin driving, Lakitu will appear with a traffic light hanging on his fishing pole, which starts the countdown. When the light turns green, the <b>race</b> <b>or</b> battle officially begins. During a race, the player's viewpoint is from behind his or her kart. The goal of the game is to either finish a race ahead of other racers, who are controlled by the computer and other players, or complete a circuit in the fastest time. There is also a battle mode in which the aim is to attack the karts of the other human players.|$|E
