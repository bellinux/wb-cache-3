40|$|Human biobanks, {{which are}} the core <b>of</b> <b>BBMRI-ERIC</b> medical {{research}} infrastructure, are repositories of biological material and data associated with the research participants (donors or patients {{willing to participate in}} the research). The associated data covers a broad range of data types: from data collected directly from the research participants and medical processes related to them, to data generated from the biological material. This document focuses on describing biobank data processing workflows that were selected for piloting in EGI-Engage the biobanks by the BBMRI. nl and BBMRI. cz (national nodes <b>of</b> <b>BBMRI-ERIC)</b> together with their associated biobanks.

40|$|BBMRI-ERIC aims to {{facilitate}} the joint establishment and operation of research infrastructures of European interest that will provide access to the collections of partner biobanks and biomolecular resources, their expertise and services on a non-economic basis. The mission <b>of</b> <b>BBMRI-ERIC</b> CS-IT project, which started in January 2016, is to deliver expertise, services, and tools relevant to the pursuance of the tasks and activities <b>of</b> <b>BBMRI-ERIC.</b> The project work is divided into 8 work packages (WPs), with WP 8 responsible for providing specifications and tools for facilitating collaboration on Data Harmonization, mainly required by WP 1 (Directory service) and WP 2 (Sample locator). The aim of this document is to define initial requirement specifications for common terminologies and reporting data sets to support CS-IT architecture plan (Alexandre et al. 2016), based on input from European biobanks and national nodes. The input was provided mainly through two separate questionnaires, one directed to European Biobanks listed in the BBMRI-ERIC Directory, the other directed to National Node Coordinators. In addition, follow-up questionnaires were sent to selected biobanks from each BBMRI-ERIC member country. The results of these questionnaires were considered together with information from additional sources, such as Sample Finder webinars 1, BBMRI-ERIC Use Cases document (Holub et al. 2016) and State of the Art Review of Harmonization Tools (Mate et al. 2016) {{in order to provide}} the initial requirement specifications...|$|R

It shall enable the partners to operate within agreed terms with respect to participant consent, ethics committee approvals and national regulations ensuring researchers supply and access data and/or samples whilst working under a common ethical framework. It aims to build a joint policy to address ELSI considerations <b>of</b> biological <b>resource</b> providers as well as to enhance related procedures for the user community of BMS RIs. Ethics requirements 2 (informed consent), 3 (incidental finding policy), 9 (procedures on data collection, etc) and 10 (relevant authorisations) are addressed in the general provisions of the CORBEL Ethical Governance Framework. CORBEL has to monitor the compliance of the Ethical Governance Framework (e. g. statement of adherence). The responsibility to meet these ethics requirements and legal compliance ultimately lies with the individual sample and/or data provider and not with the respective research infrastructures. 	Prior to implementation, the Ethical Governance Framework (including its templates) require validation of its processes and finally the approval of the Executive Board. 	The ultimate aim of this Work Package is to establish a single and sustainable support mechanism (Common Service) for all BMS RIs dealing with samples and/or data with ethical, legal and societal implications (ELSI). The submission of this report (D 7. 1) is an important achievement for reaching this goal...|$|R
