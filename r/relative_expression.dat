Data can be queried for specific proteins and genes, browsed based on organism, tissue, localization and condition, and sorted by false discovery rate and expression. MOPED empowers users to visualize their own expression data and compare it with existing studies. Further, MOPED links to various protein and pathway data- bases, including GeneCards, Panther, Entrez, UniProt, KEGG, SEED, and Reactome. Protein and gene identifiers are integrated from GeneCards (cross-referenced with MOPED), Genbank, RefSeq, UniProt, WormBase, and Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{resistance}} of endometriotic tissue to progesterone {{can be explained}} by alterations in the distribution of progesterone receptor (PR) and estrogen receptor (ER) isoforms. The aims of this study were to examine the expressions of PR-A, PR-B, ERα and ERβ in endometrioma and assess whether these expressions are affected by dienogest or leuprolide acetate (LA) treatment. Methods We enrolled 60 females, including 43 patients with endometriosis (14 who received no medical treatment, 13 who received dienogest and 16 who received LA before undergoing laparoscopic surgery) and 17 patients with leiomyoma. The expression levels of PR and ER isoforms in eutopic and ectopic endometrium were assayed with quantitative real-time PCR, and confirmed with immunohistochemistry. Results A decreased PR-B/PR-A ratio and an increased ERβ/ERα ratio were demonstrated in ectopic endometrium derived from females with endometriosis compared with the ratios observed in eutopic endometrium obtained from females without endometriosis. Although LA treatment did not affect the PR-B/PR-A and ERβ/ERα ratios, dienogest treatment increased the PR-B/PR-A ratio and decreased the ERβ/ERα ratio in patients with endometriomas. Conclusions Dienogest may improve progesterone resistance in endometriotic tissue by increasing the <b>relative</b> <b>expressions</b> of PR-B and PR-A, and decreasing the <b>relative</b> <b>expressions</b> of ERβ and ERα. </p...|$|R
40|$|Wild rice (WR) {{is a very}} nutritious grain {{that has}} been used to treat {{diabetes}} in Chinese medicinal practice. City diet (CD) is based on the diet consumed by Asian area residents in modern society, which is rich in saturated fats, cholesterol and carbohydrates. The present study was aimed at evaluating the effects of replacing white rice and processed wheat starch of CD with WR as the chief source of dietary carbohydrates on insulin resistance in rats fed with a high-fat/cholesterol diet. Except the rats of the low-fat (LF) diet group, the rats of the other three groups, including to high-fat/cholesterol (HFC) diet, CD and WR diet, were fed with high-fat/cholesterol diets for eight weeks. The rats fed with CD exhibited higher weight gain and lower insulin sensitivity compared to the rats consuming a HFC diet. However, WR suppressed high-fat/cholesterol diet-induced insulin resistance. WR decreased liver homogenate triglyceride and free fatty acids levels, raised serum adiponectin concentration and reduced serum lipocalin- 2 and visfatin concentrations. In addition, the WR diet potently augmented the <b>relative</b> <b>expressions</b> of adiponectin receptor 2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, alpha and gamma, and abated <b>relative</b> <b>expressions</b> of leptin and lipocalin- 2 in the tissues of interest.

The results showed that the dominant product of S. bovis S 1 was lactate at both pH, the production depended on the starch level, and more lactate was produced at pH 6.5 than that at pH 5.5 (P <  0.001). At pH 5.5, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and α-amylase (α-AMY), their abundances, the <b>relative</b> <b>expressions</b> of LDH, PFL (gene encoding pyruvate formate-lyase), CCPA (gene encoding global catabolite control protein A) and α-AMY genes were higher than those at pH 6.5 (P <  0.05), whereas the concentration of fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate (FDP) was lower. The activity of LDH, α-AMY and FDP, and the <b>relative</b> <b>expressions</b> of LDH, PFL, CCPA and α-AMY genes were, in general, positively related to the starch level. The canonical regression analysis indicated that the pH had more profound effect compared with the starch level, in terms of the acid productions, enzyme activity and gene expressions. It was concluded that the fermentation of S. bovis was regulated at the transcription level in response to both pH and substrate starch concentration, but more sensitive to pH changes.|$|R

Expression of four of the seven oncogenes was increased in megaloblastic and iron deficiency anaemia. C-mos showed differences among the five morphological subgroups; it correlated with abnormal location (p = 0. 025) and seemed to influence prognosis.

Training groups did the exercise on a motor-driven treadmill at 25 m/min (0 % grade) for 60 min/day for eight weeks (5 days/week). Rats were fed orally, with Baneh extraction and saline for six weeks. The two-way ANOVA was employed for statistical analysis.   ABCG 5 <b>relative</b> gene <b>expression</b> was detected by Real-time PCR method. Results:The current findings indicate that the Baneh-treated tissues had significantly lower levels of ABCG 5 gene expression in the liver, small intestine, and kidneys (P< 0. 001, P< 0. 003, P< 0. 001, respectively), when compared with saline-treated tissues. However, a higher level of gene expression was observed in exercise groups.
